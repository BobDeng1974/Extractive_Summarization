by @entity0 published : 10:52 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 21:57 est , 10 july 2013 two bereft newlyweds who lost their spouses months after saying ' i do ' , have told how a chance introduction led them to find love and hope again with each other			2
in a moving @entity10 video @entity7 and @entity8 explain that they were both widowed in their twenties			1
@entity7 's husband was killed in a motorcycle accident while cancer took @entity8 's wife			1
at first the pair - who did not know each other and lived in different cities - thought finding another life partner would be impossible , but thanks to mutual friends they randomly came to connect and just last month tied the knot in @entity24			1
however , just two - and - a - half months after their big day he was out riding on his motorcycle and involved in a road accident			1
severe injuries and major blood loss led to his eventual death on july 30			0
@entity44 created by @entity45 of @entity46 recalling her emotions , she said : ' life after losing a spouse is really difficult as you can imagine			0
' you know , all of your hopes and dreams are kind of wrapped up in that person			0
' you set forth and you 're ready to take on life and you assume that that person ’s going to be a part of the story			0
' ' life after losing a spouse is really difficult			0
all of your hopes and dreams are kind of wrapped up in that person ' meanwhile @entity8 , 31 , a lawyer turned @entity67 pastor , says that he got married on august 22 , 2009			1
but ten months later his 27 - year - old wife @entity68 started feeling ill. doctors diagnosed her with @entity70 primary cardiac sarcoma , a rare cancer that develops in or on the heart			1
her condition rapidly deteriorated and she lost her battle with the disease on april 23 , 2011			0
shortly after his wife 's funeral a friend of @entity8 's came to visit him in @entity67 and dropped the name ' @entity7 ' into conversation			1
they mentioned that she had also lost her partner at a young age and had blogged about her experience			2
smiling again : @entity7 , whose first husband died just months after their wedding in a road accident , said she never thought she would meet someone like @entity8 intrigued , @entity8 decided to look her up online			1
' when i found her			0
i did what everybody does and sent her a friend request on @entity95 , ' he said			0
' she accepted it a day or two later			0
i sat at my computer and it took me about half - an - hour to write this carefully crafted message that sounded cool , not stalkerish or creepy			1
' after exchanging messages online @entity8 and @entity7 discovered that they had dozens of mutual friends and lots of shared interests including cooking , travel , photography and @entity108			1
a couple of weeks after friending @entity7 on @entity95 , @entity8 decided to visit her in @entity110 where she worked as a marketing specialist			1
' we could both be vulnerable early on , in a way that only people who have gone through what we 've gone through could understand ' ' he admitted that he was relatively an internet stranger but there were people that we knew mutually that could vouch for him , ' she said			0
immediately when they met , they hit it off			0
on their first ' date ' they ended up sitting and talking for five hours , sharing stories about their previous relationships and heartache			0
' one of the things that helped with @entity8 and i being able to click so quickly was the fact that we could both be very vulnerable so early on , in a way that only people who have gone through what we ’ve gone through could understand , ' @entity7 said			1
half way through one of their conversations @entity8 said that he stopped and turned to @entity7 and told her she was ' incredible '			1
within weeks , they introduced the other to their families and said that they instantly knew they would be married			2
meant to be : the couple , pictured here with another pair of newlyweds , tied the knot last month in a bid to make sure they were ' thinking clearly ' and not letting grief cloud their perspective , they booked in for a session of premarital counseling			1
the therapist ordered an assessment test which included questions on topics from conflict resolution to financial management			0
thankfully the results confirmed the couple 's deep connection			2
they told @entity165 that the therapist said : ' either you guys are the kind of people who anticipate the other person 's answer or you are the most compatible couple i have ever seen			2
' the loved - up couple , who ca n't even remember how or when they got engaged , married on june 22 , in a simple ceremony in @entity24			2
at their nuptials they played their five - minute long video , created with help from the @entity182 , detailing their moving story			0
the entire congregation , which included the families of their late spouses , were apparently moved to tears as the film played			0
@entity7 added : ' i imagined that i would find someone to marry and move on with but			2
i did n’t really think it was possible to meet someone like [ @entity8 ]			2

@entity7 's husband died two - and - a - half months after their wedding *due* to a motorcycling accident
