by @entity1 reporter published : 17:59 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 8 december 2013 owning a bike gives you a sense of freedom like no other , yet owning a bike shop can be a strangely frustrating experience			1
one @entity11 war veteran who now operates a tiny cycle chop in @entity13 , @entity9 has been told to change the store 's name			0
@entity16 , owner of @entity17 and says he 's received a letter from the lawyers of the giants of the @entity22 bike industry , @entity23			1
name calling : @entity16 , the owner of a small bike shop in @entity9 , @entity11 has been told to change its name by a bicycle company that owns the trademark of the word ' @entity30 ' legal action : a small bike shop in @entity13 , @entity9 , @entity11 has recently been threatened with legal action by @entity22 bicycle manufacturer @entity23 regarding a trademark violation concerning the shop 's name the company want to see the store ’s name change because @entity23 own the trademark on the word @entity30 , which they use to market a brand of road bike			1
mr @entity16 says he did n’t name his store after the company ’s bike , but rather after a region in @entity49 that hosts one of the most famous bike races in the world , the grueling 117 - year - old @entity53			1
essentially , the name is an icon of bike culture and there a hundreds of other products from bike tires to a cycling tights that use @entity49 region 's name			1
' it ’s been frustrating , ' mr @entity16 told the @entity64			0
' the response throughout this process ( from @entity23 ) has been arrogant and almost unbelievably dismissive			2
' the rights : @entity23 claims this is a matter of defending a legally owned trademark what next ? @entity70 has sought legal assistance in determining whether @entity30 can be registered in @entity11			1
however , he estimates it will take upwards of $ 150,000 to contest the case in court , a price which may be prohibitive to the small business owner ' we did n’t want to go public , but they ’ve made it clear on no uncertain terms , they are going to sue			0
' @entity84 , managing director of @entity85 says the company has a right to defend its legally owned trademark			2
' a simple trademark search would have prevented this , ' @entity84 wrote in an email , along with a reference to the federal government ’s trademark database showing @entity23 ’s registration of the word @entity30			1
' we are required to defend or lose our trademark registration			2
' mr @entity16 who served in @entity98 says running the store has helped him over come post-traumatic stress disorder			0
after making a search online he did not feel that naming his shop after a geographical location would contradict @entity11 ’s intellectual property protection laws			0
' i had assumed i could not register @entity30 as a trademark as it is a geographical location well known in cycling , not to mention the wide - spread use of the term @entity30 throughout the industry , ' said mr @entity16			1
the real story : @entity70 , a military veteran medically released from service in 2012 after developing @entity114 during deployment in @entity116 , @entity98 , opened his shop on march 1 , 2013 and asserts the shop 's name is an homage to @entity30 , @entity49 innocent : ' i had assumed i could not register @entity30 as a trademark as it is a geographical location well known in cycling , not to mention the wide - spread use of the term @entity30 throughout the industry , ' said @entity70 ' i thought i could freely use @entity30			1
to be informed i can not use the name is devastating			0
i invested my life savings , military severance pay , as well as all my veteran 's affairs award for my illness into @entity30			2
' furthermore , his store sells high - end bikes and does not sell @entity23 products			1
he does n’t believe the name would confuse anybody shopping for bikes			0
' i understand the need for the protection of intellectual property , but this is named after a city known worldwide for this race , ' mr @entity16 said			0
' for our customer base , there ’s an appeal ( with the name @entity30 )			2
our market understands that race , and it reflects what we want to provide for them			0
' @entity70 says his lawyer thinks they have a good case to make , but the fight could cost upwards of $ 150,000 in legal fees			0
he claims that changing his company ’s name is n’t as simple as putting up a new sign and logo			0
in the year since the store opened he has built up a decent brand , reputation and online presence			0
there appears to be some positive news as a result of the potential brawl ; @entity30 is also selling far more products from its online store than usual			1
a number of cyclists have changed their @entity178 to include the word @entity30 and say they will be boycotting @entity23 until it backs down			1
ideas : ' i thought i could freely use @entity30			2
to be informed i can not use the name is devastating			0
i invested my life savings , military severance pay , as well as all my veteran 's affairs award for my illness into @entity30			2

@entity23 owns the trademark for the use of @entity30 on certain cycling products
the @entity30 bike shop sells bikes ( but not the brand @entity23 )
@entity30 is a town in @entity49 famous in cycling for being the *destination* of the *classic* @entity53 road race
