by @entity1 medical correspondent drug : @entity3 , a pill that gives at least four months of extra life , is given to patients after chemo , when they are running out of options the @entity10 rationing body is refusing to give men with prostate cancer a drug that can delay the need for chemotherapy			1
@entity3 , a pill that gives at least four months of extra life , is given to patients after chemo , when they are running out of options			1
but thousands could benefit from taking it earlier , since it has fewer side effects than chemotherapy and improves quality of life			1
the @entity25 and @entity26 ( @entity27 ) today says in final draft guidance that it will not approve such use on the @entity10			1
campaigners and doctors have condemned the decision , saying it is another example of @entity27 limiting treatment options for cancer sufferers			2
they fear that innovative treatments in the pipeline do n’t stand a chance of getting approved under the rationing system , and that promised changes next year will actually worsen the situation			0
they also claim it is ‘ illogical ’ to prevent men being treated with abiraterone earlier in the disease , when the @entity10 is already picking up the bill for treatment after chemotherapy			1
@entity51 , chief executive of @entity53 @entity52 said ‘ it ’s a fiasco			0
this decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer			1
‘ for many this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it			1
’ @entity68 , treasurer of the prostate cancer charity tackle , added : ‘ we ’re so distraught that @entity27 keep limiting these life saving drugs for men with no other life lines , with seemingly no evidence to support their decisions			1
’ doctors at the @entity78 in @entity79 , where the drug was discovered , said the decision showed the system operated by @entity27 was not fit for purpose – the same charge made last week when the breast cancer drug @entity86 was blocked			2
angry : thousands of patients could benefit from taking the drug earlier , but the @entity27 says it will not approve such use on the @entity10			1
@entity51 ( pictured ) , of @entity52 , described it as a ' kick in the teeth ' in the case of abiraterone , @entity27 said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease			0
when the drug is used after chemotherapy , different rules apply that take into account the end - of - life plight of patients which make the drug cost - effective			2
although the drug is sold to the @entity10 at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used , the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy			2
the official price of a month ’s treatment is £ 3,000 but the @entity10 pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer			0
professor @entity116 , interim chief executive of @entity78 , @entity79 , said : ‘ @entity3 , which was discovered at @entity78 , is now used as standard after chemotherapy , where it was found to be cost - effective under @entity27 ’s own end - of - life criteria			2
deadly disease : @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , was used pre-chemotherapy by 3,000 men last year through the @entity123 , which picks up the bill for patients in @entity126			2
above , prostate cancer cells ‘ it is plainly illogical that @entity27 did not have the flexibility to assess use of abiraterone before chemotherapy under the same end - of - life criteria , simply because men were here surviving for longer than the two - year cut - off			1
‘ it is an unintended , and quite bizarre , consequence of the current rules for appraisals that patients have to wait until their life expectancy drops before they can access beneficial drugs on the @entity10			2
‘ now men will have to wait until they are in the final stage of their lives before they can access this treatment , and men who are too frail to receive chemotherapy face not being able to receive abiraterone at all			2
’ @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , was used pre-chemotherapy by 3,000 men last year through the @entity123 , which picks up the bill for patients in @entity126 when a drug is awaiting approval from @entity27			1
some @entity154 have survived on it for almost five years			0
blocked : doctors at the @entity78 said @entity27 's decision showed its system was not fit for purpose - the same charge made last week when the breast cancer drug @entity86 was blocked mr @entity51 added : ‘ the current system is flawed			0
it is not fit for purpose and it is the very people it is supposed to serve who are bearing the brunt			0
‘ this decision is unjust and it needs to be overturned so that men in desperate need can receive the most effective drugs , wherever they live			0
’ professor @entity116 said there was mounting concern that @entity154 patients would increasingly lose out			0
‘ we believe that the current @entity27 system for drug appraisals takes too little account of how innovative a treatment is , and we worry that the new rules under consideration could make this situation even worse , ' he said			0
‘ it is likely that many modern targeted therapies will be more effective in patients when used earlier in treatment or in combinations , but it will be impossible to provide treatment in these ways if innovative drugs first fail to clear the hurdle of @entity27 approval			0
’ dr @entity196 , medical director at @entity197 said the company would appeal			0
‘ we are very disappointed with this decision which , if it stands , will leave thousands of men in @entity126 in the advanced stages of prostate cancer with no option but to accept chemotherapy - which they may not necessarily need or want yet - before being eligible to receive abiraterone routinely on the @entity10 , ' he said			1
‘ these men will eventually be able to receive abiraterone on the @entity10 after chemotherapy anyway , but will be denied the option of taking it earlier on in their illness			1
’ in 2012 , @entity27 attempted to ban the use of abiraterone altogether but was forced into a u-turn after a public outcry and a rare intervention from the @entity217 ( dh )			0
in june , former health minister @entity218 urged the @entity217 to intervene to call off the restriction on pre-chemotherapy use of abiraterone			0
sir @entity222 , @entity27 chief executive , said ‘ we know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects , so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way			1
‘ however , it was clear that the drug is not cost effective at its current price			0

@entity3 gives at least four months ' extra life to prostate cancer patients
drug given to men after chemotherapy when they are running out of options
but thousands of people could benefit from taking pill earlier , doctors claim
it has fewer side effects than chemotherapy and can improve quality of life
nice today says in final draft guidance it will not approve such use on @entity10
