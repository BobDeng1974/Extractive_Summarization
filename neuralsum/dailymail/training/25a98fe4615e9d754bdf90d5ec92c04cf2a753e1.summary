by @entity0 published : 02:00 est , 28 december 2013 updated : 15:44 est , 28 december 2013 of all the images @entity2 ’s suffering supporters will take home from the loss of the @entity6 , the sight of @entity8 dragging himself from the pitch at the @entity10 carrying his bat upside down might just turn out to be the one that survives the longest			1
in the @entity15 summer series , @entity8 was the batting rock on which @entity2 built their 3 - 0 win , with 562 runs , including three hundreds at @entity20 , @entity21 ’s and the @entity22 : brilliant , confident and consistent performances which team - mates and opponents alike understood might have papered over a variety of cracks			1
their batting stalwart from the @entity55 and former coach @entity56 , a magnificent jumbler of popular terms , once called the condition ‘ caught in two man ’s land ’			0
hard to better that here			0
indeed , such was the collective loss of marbles @entity2 suffered in collapsing not once in a second innings lasting just 61 overs , but twice as they slumped from 65 for no wicket to 179 all out , that some unkind observers might suggest they may as well all try using the bat upside down for what remains of the series			1
@entity2 had produced some beauties before they arrived in @entity10 : six for nine runs and seven for 49 in the first test in @entity75 and four for six in @entity76 the best of them			1
but losing three wickets for one run in six balls , then squandering their last five for six runs in a sorry , overall surrender of eight wickets for seven runs , when attempting to convert a first innings lead of 51 into a match - winning position was something else			2
and no matter how the rest of the series pans out here and in @entity95 next week , the manner of so many of the dismissals , ranging from the brainless to the brain - dead , not only indicates just how mentally shot @entity97 ’s men are but how much work is required to fashion a side capable of winning back the urn in 18 months ’ time			1
hard to credit it , but the outcome could have been even worse had @entity103 taken another golden opportunity to dismiss @entity105 when he had scored just nine of the 49 runs which , in the main , he had earned with great skill , patience and focus until he ran out of patience and partners			1
if @entity113 had hit any of the three stumps he had to aim at when @entity115 called his partner for an imaginary single at 102 - 4 , @entity105 would have been run out by the best part of three yards and the match might not even have lasted until day four			1
thanks ! @entity39 celebrates reaching his half - century as @entity103 's tail wagged once again fast start : @entity97 wasted no time in scoring his runs when @entity2 's openers when out to bat milestone : the skipper became the youngest player ever to pass 8,000 test runs during the afternoon captain 's job : @entity97 scored a gutsy half - century - here 's his @entity132 from our @entity134 service @entity105 and @entity97 can be exempted from some of the criticism			1
the skipper batted more fluently than at any other time in the tour for his fifty before @entity44 did him for pace at 65 - 1			0
@entity105 showed once again that he does have the flexibility of approach to adapt his game to the needs of the side and the context of the match , the sadness being that it seems to have taken him until now even to accept the possibility that he might need to			2
@entity152 , lbw to @entity113 , battled well for just over two hours without looking as though he would ever make it to 20			0
@entity154 hit out briefly against @entity35 before @entity44 had him caught behind			0
far better batsmen than @entity156 have been nowhere near good enough to survive the kind of delivery with which @entity44 claimed his 31st wicket of the series			0
but the rest of the dismissals betrayed techniques and minds stretched beyond the point of no return , from @entity167 ’s mad and ultimately successful attempt to run himself out at 86 - 2 , @entity8 ’s half - push , half - block at 86 - 3 , @entity115 ’s underhit drive to @entity171 off @entity35 , and later as they slid from 173 - 5 to 179 all out , possibly the worst of them all , featuring @entity174			2
got him ! @entity44 appeals just before @entity97 was given out lbw as the @entity2 wheels began to come off dropping like flies : @entity167 was run out by @entity44 after making 15 as the tourists ' demise started trudging off : @entity152 departs the @entity10 square after being trapped in front by @entity113 @entity181 ? @entity8 was caught by @entity44 after misjudging a @entity31 delivery first ball @entity105 was on 45 and in a groove , and another hour or so of him and @entity2 may well have racked up a lead of 300 - plus which would have made them favourites for a victory that would mean so much			1
all @entity174 needed to do , especially after @entity32 had just chopped one on , was not get out , so quite what he was doing teeing off and slicing his third ball , from @entity35 straight to @entity193 at slip , must remain a mystery			0
two - man ’s land ? that is where you end up when you do n’t know when the time is right to try to grind out runs or to attempt to impose yourself on the bowlers , or maybe when you have lost the ability to distinguish between the @entity205 knowing whether to stick or twist and ending up doing neither			2
@entity35 deserved his moment in front of another huge crowd of 70,000 - plus but even he must have been somewhat embarrassed by the fact that none of the balls with which he took 5 - 50 , and his 100th @entity215 wicket in the process , actually turned			2
no wonder @entity218 called it quits			0
it was left to @entity105 to try to make sense of it all and , to be fair to him , he made a pretty brave fist of it , suggesting the demands of back - to - back @entity6 series had left @entity2 jaded and ‘ a bit fragile ’ , not to mention the possibility that the schedule may have contributed to the early return home of @entity229 and the permanent departure of @entity218			1
‘ i think people should n’t forget , and it ’s never been done before that guys have got to go and endure 10 back - to - back @entity6 matches			0
‘ it has been an incredibly pressurised situation , being away for the second leg and not starting in the manner that we are accustomed to … it ’s been incredibly difficult			0
‘ i ’ve been told that a number of @entity243 athletes go into some sort of post-olympic depression or a negative frame of mind , and i ’m not saying we ’re in a depression or a negative frame of mind , but after you ’ve competed at such a level , post that competition , mentally you are a bit fragile			0
’ that is one explanation			0
another is that @entity2 have played a lot of pants			2
@entity260 away : @entity35 took five big wickets with his off - spin during the third day temper ! @entity44 exchanges very strong words with @entity105 as the game became heated for a spell resistence : @entity105 was the only batsman to really hang around after the lunch break @entity269 : @entity270 and @entity271 set about scoring quickly when they were set 231 to win			1

@entity2 facing *humiliating* series *whitewash* after another batting collapse
@entity97 the only batsman to pass 50 , @entity105 scored 49
tourists lost last five wickets for just six runs in below - par total of 179
@entity103 were 30 - 0 at stumps and need another 201 for victory on day four
