the gangster who supplied the murder weapon which killed @entity3 has attempted to return to the area where the late boy ’s family live , it was claimed today			1
@entity7 , who provided the @entity9 revolver used to kill the 11 - year - old child , can not enter the @entity12 neighbourhood of @entity13 where the murder took place			1
but the 27 - year - old applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative - meaning he could have been in the area where @entity3 ’s parents @entity20 and @entity21 still live			1
gangster : @entity7 ( left ) , who provided the @entity9 revolver used to kill @entity3 ( right ) , can not enter the @entity12 neighbourhood of @entity13 where the murder took place mrs @entity21 , 49 , said it was ‘ awful ’ to learn of his application in a letter last saturday - the day before @entity29 , which she described as an ‘ emotional occasion ’			1
‘ i ’m so upset , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’ve barely got words to describe how angry i am			0
i had to come home from work as it was so emotional			0
‘ how can they be allowed to apply for dropping the exclusion zone ? this is the third time this has happened now			1
the whole system is a farce			0
’ the @entity42 said @entity7 would be dropped off by his father @entity43 - who was jailed for more than four years for trying to cover up the murder - and later picked up on an agreed route			2
however , the @entity46 was said to have revealed yesterday that @entity7 's request had been denied			1
reacting to this decision , mrs @entity21 said : ‘ at last , common sense prevails			1
’ but she added the continual and brazen appeals by the gang members to enter their neighbourhood were emotionally draining and unfair			0
@entity7 was released last april - leaving just one of the seven - strong gang in prison			2
@entity3 was shot by @entity3 , 16 , aided by six others , on his way home from football practice in 2007			2
shooting location : @entity3 died on august 22 , 2007 , outside @entity62 pub in @entity12			1
@entity7 applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative after @entity7 walked free it meant only @entity3 , who was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years , was left behind bars after seven people were convicted over their involvement in the horrific crime			1
following his release , mrs @entity21 called @entity7 the ‘ most evil of them all ’			1
@entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and a 16 - year - old who can not be named have all served sentences			1
grief : if @entity7 had been successful in his bid , he could have been in the area where @entity3 ’s parents @entity20 and @entity21 ( pictured ) still live @entity7 was 21 when he was jailed for just seven years for supplying the gun used to kill @entity3 and helping @entity3 cover his tracks			1
he and two other members of the @entity89 , 18 , and @entity76 , 17 - winked , smiled , smirked and cheered in the dock as they were handed sentences blasted as ' disgusting ' by @entity3 's family			1
the trial judge , mr @entity93 , told @entity7 : ' there is strong evidence you were an active gang member			0
i have no doubt you were a willing assistant helping in any way you could			0
' @entity101 ' term was later increased to 12 years by the lord chief justice , who attacked the ' modern pestilence ' of gun crime			0
but because @entity7 spent almost a year in prison awaiting trial , that time counted towards his final sentence			2
that means he spent just over five years behind bars since being found guilty of assisting the schoolboy 's murderer			0
he was released on licence midway through his sentence , as is commonplace , and will be monitored outside prison for the remainder of the 12 years			0
@entity3 died on august 22 , 2007 , when @entity3 , armed with a revolver , cycled to his estate to try to shoot members of the rival @entity120			2
@entity3 was struck by his second bullet			0
the ' wall of silence ' faced by police meant that while @entity3 's name swiftly emerged as the prime suspect in the shooting outside @entity62 pub , months of painstaking detective work was required to charge him with murder			1
the gun itself , a .455 calibre @entity134 and @entity135 revolver with a six - inch barrel , may have been handed down through generations of @entity13 criminals			2
it was made during the @entity140 in about 1915 , but remained in good working order			0
the rifling in the barrel was worn and the bullets fired by @entity3 were slightly undersized , causing them to tumble end - over - end			2
that meant the round which hit @entity3 was side - on when it struck him in the back of the neck , splintering vertebrae and destroying his windpipe before exiting through his throat			0
the @entity151 also had an imitation @entity152 @entity154 converted to fire live rounds , a @entity157 revolver and a @entity159 7.62 handgun .			0

@entity7 provided @entity9 revolver used to kill boy in 2007
*banned* from entering @entity12 , @entity13 , where murder took place
but he applied for exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted to visit a relative
this is the area where @entity3 's parents @entity20 and @entity21 still live
mrs @entity21 said she was ' so upset ' and can not ' describe how angry i am '
but @entity46 revealed yesterday request from 27 - year - old @entity101 was denied
