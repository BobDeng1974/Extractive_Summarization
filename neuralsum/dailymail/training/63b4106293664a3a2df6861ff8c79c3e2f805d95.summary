by @entity0 there are certain qualities that make anyone appear attractive and all reduce to this simple equation : if you love sex and love people , you 're probably sexy			1
all of us have a subconscious ' sexy ' radar which automatically tunes in to people who 've got ' it '			1
our looks radar sets off first - instantly scanning for the best - looking person in the crowd - then the sexy radar clicks in , looking for more subtle ( and surer ) indicators that someone 's worth talking to			1
score all six of the following and it 's guaranteed you 're the girl getting the most attention - and guess what , it 's really not about what you look like ! @entity0 says that showing enthusiasm is a great way to keep a guy 's attention @entity29 enthusiasm is infectious - you ca n't help but smile and respond to someone who 's full of life			1
it does n't really matter what it is you 're passionate about , so long as you 're throwing your arms around and getting excited about something			2
as one guy put it , ' the girl in the corner whose facial expression does n't change and talks in a monotone is n't appealing , even if she 's sprouting all her sexual secrets			1
it 's the girl who 's gesturing madly and talking a million miles an hour who you want			2
even if she 's discussing what colour to paint her bathroom			2
' @entity55 like he 's the only person in the room @entity59 just walked in , @entity60 is at the next table shirtless and the waiter just dropped a Â£ 100 bill at your feet but your eyes have n't moved from his face			2
the person who looks you directly in the eye , really listens , calls you by name and focuses on what you 're saying wins every time			2
@entity0 suggests keeping his gaze to make him feel like the only man in the room @entity78 a person who is n't scared to express an opinion even if it 's the opposite to everyone else 's , might be called opinionated , stroppy or even rude , but there 's one thing they 'll never be branded - boring			1
stick up for your beliefs and believe in yourself			0
we all respect and admire people who hold their head up and fight their own battles			0
you 're not scared to touch never , ever underestimate the power of touch			0
the person who really hugs hello , who puts a concerned hand on your arm if you 're upset , gives a firm handshake to say , ' congratulations ! ' is making warm , sexy gestures that make them seem approachable			0
@entity0 says a strong personality , even a moody or stroppy one , is far better than being boring do n't forget to touch yourself too			1
smoothing your stockings , pushing back your hair , hugging yourself if you 're a bit cold - it 's all very sensual and inviting and draws attention to whatever body part you 're touching			0
if you 're stingy with your affection , others assume you 're cold , hard to get to know , @entity117 of which are adjectives you want applied to you , right ? you 're aware of your body - and know how to show it @entity121 the more you like your body , the better you 'll present it to the world			0
sit with your arms crossed , clutching a pillow across your stomach and the message is obvious : i feel fat and i 'm trying to hide my stomach			0
a woman who does a big , lazy stretch , lifting her arms up , sends a very different message : i 'm proud of my body			0
you 're not looks obsessed it 's hard to accept someone will find you sexy with a red wine stained mouth , mascara down your cheeks and hair askew but you 'll still look a better than the girl who spends all night staring into her mirror			0
one reason why the just - got - out - of - bed tousled look never , ever goes out of fashion ! find out more of @entity0 's views and check out her books and product ranges at @entity153			1
