what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object ? it is probably a little like driving a 7.5 ton truck into a 25 ton granite boulder			1
the @entity7 government has funded a series of tests to smash a series of vehicles into giant pieces of rock - all in the name of science			1
researchers at @entity17 conducted the experiments to help them model how pieces of rock are able to withstand collisions			1
they have been developing a method of determining whether naturally occurring boulders can be used as security barriers around government buildings			2
by filming the collisions with high speed cameras , they were able to study the impact and see how much the boulder moved			2
crash - test dummies are getting bigger to reflect the expanding waistlines and larger bottoms of many modern motorists			0
manufacturer @entity35 have developed a new model after studies found that obese drivers are 78 percent more likely to die in a car crash			0
dummies have traditionally been modeled on a person weighing about 167 pounds with a healthy body mass index			0
the new super-sized dummies are based on the measurements of a 273 - pound person with a @entity47 of 35 - which is considered to be obese			0
@entity35 has also been developing an age - appropriate dummy to better reflect our aging population			0
perhaps unsurprisingly , the outcome of the collisions depended upon three variables - the size of the boulder , the speed and size of the truck and the soil the boulder was embedded in			1
they found that when a medium - sized truck weighing around 7.5 tons and travelling at 30mph crashes into a five ton boulder of @entity7 black granite burined four feet deep , the boulder becomes dislodged from the soil and the truck continued travelling over the top of the boulder			1
however , when faced with a larger 25 ton boulder of @entity74 white granite , buried about seven feet deep , the boulder moved only slightly and stopped the truck			1
the team were able to use their model to predict the outcome of the crashes			0
however , they found that if the boulder was hit at an angle and it had not been buried enough , it would rotate out of the way and allow the truck to continue			2
the researchers now say that their model is ready for use in the field by officials at the @entity89 to help them find ways of protecting embassies abroad			2
scientists drove a 7.5 ton truck into a 25 ton white granite boulder ( above ) with some rather predictable results the @entity7 @entity96 funded the work to help protect its embassies abroad , but many like this @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , use man - made barriers and anti-ram technology to protect the buildings dr @entity106 , a civil engineer at @entity17 who led the study , said : ' we provided a tool for the @entity96 to be able to size a boulder for embassy protection			1
' it 's a quick assessment tool so they can do it very quickly			0
' you can design all kinds of systems , but then the system has to be deployable overseas			0
' for the @entity96 , sometimes they just want to have a quick evaluation			2
they want to come up with things maybe on the fly , as a first approximation			0
' using a smaller five ton granite boulder , seen above , meant the rock rolled and launched the truck into the air their findings are published in the @entity130			1
they hope they can be used to help officials find anti-ram barriers that can be quickly installed outside public buildings			0
while some government buildings adopt expensive artificial barriers specifically designed to stop vehicles in their tracks before they can get close , others have tried to use local rocks			0
however , predicting how these will respond to an impact is less predictable , so the @entity96 asked the @entity17 team to investigate			1
the 25 ton boulder moved slightly but not much was left of the truck after the crash as can be seen above using the @entity148 , they installed the two boulders on a track before smashing the vehicles into them			1
@entity153 , one of the authors of the study who is now at @entity157 in @entity158 , told @entity159 : ' watching crash tests is a harrowing experience , just the sound and the vibrations from it as you ’re standing on the sideline , it ’s so percussive it shakes you to your core			0
' it turns out that in order to have a boulder buried in sand and have it work , it needs to be big			2
' the 25 ton granite boulder moved only slightly when it was hit by the truck travelling at 30mph in tests ( above )			1

engineers at @entity17 smashed trucks into boulders at 30mph
the 7.5 ton trucks were launched into the air by a five ton granite boulder
a 25 ton block of granite buried in soil stopped the truck almost completely
researchers used the results to build models to help protect buildings
the @entity7 @entity96 funded the work to help protect its embassies
