it was as @entity1 yodelled for the 48th time that i killed her			1
that is what a summer holiday in @entity6 does to you			1
i blame the combination of goats , chocolate , mountains and a sunny day			2
what surprised me about the country - and specifically the @entity15 - is how it is precisely as you would want and expect the place to be			2
it is incredibly clean , very picturesque , all the church and town hall clocks tell the right time , and even the buses run to schedule			2
@entity24 : @entity25 and @entity1 found spa relaxation amid the splendid scenery of @entity28 ' train to @entity29 leaving at precisely 13.32 , ' i say to @entity1 , as we run from the airport to the station			1
' @entity33 , ' sings @entity1 , popping on her straw hat			1
actually , just assume this is her response to almost anything , because the only thing that seems to stop her tonsils warbling is food and drink			2
@entity29 , which sounded to me like a rapper with a low - slung trouser , is a quaint town with a selection of tidy buildings including an obligatory church			2
we store our baggage in flimsy - looking tin cupboards at the station to take a bus trip to a famous and very old spa bath			1
the taking of the healing waters at @entity53 began 700 years ago , when @entity55 monks rigged up a medieval bungee jump to swing sick people down to the thermal pools , where they left them sitting in the water for up to a week			2
not a low - trousered rapper after all : the town of @entity29 sits framed by glorious mountain scenery our guide , @entity65 , says : ' you can imagine how wrinkly they got , but they believed the skin had to open up to allow the illness to come out			1
' it takes ten - and - half years for the water to travel from its source before emerging through a crack in the gorge , and the temperature and mineral content never changes			2
in 1535 , a local physician wrote about their efficacy and ' elf and safety suddenly got involved , with men being required to remove firearms before entering and guests who committed indecency being banished for 101 years			2
our night 's accommodation is at the @entity89 , where our beds have the most gigantic pillows			1
the hotel food is excellent - as is the local wine - and we sleep like clean , tidy logs			2
in the morning , we walk over to @entity95 to see the @entity96 - dedicated to the little mountain girl created by @entity6 author @entity98 in the late 19th century			1
it is the most translated novel in the world			2
' interestingly , her husband , @entity101 , was a friend of @entity103 , ' i remark			2
a very pretty state of affairs : @entity29 is a picture of peaceful @entity6 tranquility @entity1 yodels lightly and fingers some @entity110 honey , before settling on a postcard featuring a girl in plaits and a goat			1
we 're picked up by @entity116 from the @entity117 , one of the oldest wine estates in @entity120 and , since 1998 , run by a woman			2
' she has changed things for the better , ' says @entity116			0
tell you one thing : the place is immaculate			0
you could eat your dinner off the floor			0
surprisingly , the vineyard also produces vinegar , which is the enemy of the vine because of the bacteria needed to make it			0
' vinegar is actually a refining of wine , ' explains @entity116 , over a delicious lunch of salad dressed with horseradish and mint vinegars			0
later , we dump our bags at the five - star @entity143 , which has that peculiarly spa thing of people meandering around in dressing gowns , and go for a quick trot up to a ruined castle			0
we accidentally get lost and @entity1 gets propositioned by an old man called @entity151 on a bicycle who is wearing @entity155 shorts			1
all the afternoon 's worries are massaged away with fragrant melissa oil in the spa before we enjoy more local wine at the @entity160 , and @entity1 eats what she declares is the freshest trout she has ever tasted			1
a fragment of literary history : the idyllic village of @entity95 is the setting for the classic @entity168 story @entity110 ' 9.27 , ' i point out to @entity1 the next morning , as we get the train to @entity171 ( arr : 12.39 )			1
some of the trip is on a @entity174 , following the @entity175 and cutting past snow - topped mountains , glaciers and pointy - turreted castles on rocky promontories			0
' i have a total head for heights , ' says @entity1 , ' but i 'm more used to social - climbing than mountain - climbing			1
' we hike past an ice blue lake to @entity185 where we lunch while gazing at the glacier			0
the handsome waiter , @entity188 , tries to explain the meaning of @entity192 mit @entity190 und @entity193			0
@entity1 flirts with him until he tells her firmly that his name is @entity188 , not febreze like the smell			1
on the train back , she eventually says : ' i have run out of superlatives for the scenery			1
i 'm going to have to get @entity200 to airlift in some adjectives			0
' we spend that night at rocksresort in @entity204 , a typical skiers ' place , with the most delicious big stone bath and steam room combined , which we plunge into after gorging ourselves on @entity210 food at @entity211			0
a very fast form of clockwork : @entity25 was very impressed by the punctuality of the @entity6 railway system it 's a culinary hiking trail the next day , up to restaurants in the mountains , where we get our cards stamped and build up a full meal			1
at 10.02am , we have a glass of prosecco , at 11.17am we march past meadows and huts bearing geraniums in window boxes to another restaurant for melon and ham			0
then , up past a sign pointing to the @entity232 ( oh , how we tittered ) , we come across a crystal - clear stream which we drink from ( ' the @entity234 of the @entity168 ' , says @entity1 ) and into a blizzard of butterflies , beyond which we have our pasta course			1
from there , it 's a fairly heavy slog uphill to @entity240 where we have a splendid repast , with tons of vegetables			1
we skip pudding and set off home , with me running ahead , having perfected a low - gravity lope which @entity1 describes as like a little old man with heavy underpants			1
back at the hotel , we elect to unwind in a rather small swimming pool			0
' what does this do ? ' asks @entity1 , pressing a button just above water level			1
a huge dump of water lands on my head			1
' @entity259 probably means waterfall , ' i say			0
two wheels good : @entity1 and @entity25 explored the meadows and lanes of @entity28 by bicycle i stand closer to her as she peruses the next one , hoping to avoid any problems			1
i feel a huge thump in the ribs and with a slight woomph , shoot across the pool propelled by two jets			0
it 's a current to swim against			1
we do n't attempt the @entity277 button			0
at @entity279 restaurant that night , we go past the wine racks to get to our table and have a delicious bottle of local red which tastes of black pepper and chocolate			0
our final morning is spent on an electric bike , which is now my favourite form of transport ever			0
we zip with minimum effort past meadows full of lilac scabious , buttercups and daisies			0
we are tempted by a dip in @entity295 , but we have to get back because the bus leaves at 12.22 precisely			0
i tap my watch as it arrives			0
' spot - on , ' i say			0
' @entity298 , ' says @entity1			1
i stab her to death with a @entity300			0
it 's what she would have wanted			2
