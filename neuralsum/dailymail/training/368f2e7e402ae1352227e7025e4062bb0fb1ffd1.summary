click here for the full match report from @entity2 no drama			1
of all the words @entity5 used following @entity8 ’s latest statement of intent , none screamed out more than that soundbite			1
@entity5 was not intending to disparage @entity11 but as the @entity8 boss explained why he never had a moment ’s concern , even when his side trailed , he could not have been more cutting			1
@entity11 , remember , spent more than £ 100million in the summer after finishing second last season but the players that were brought in never had it in them to raise any anxieties in @entity5 , despite charging into an early lead			1
@entity5 claims he was never in any doubt over the result against @entity11 @entity24 leaders @entity8 celebrate after their 2 - 0 victory against the @entity26 at @entity2 ‘ i was n’t afraid to go behind , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ this team is very comfortable			0
it was no drama for me or the team when they scored			0
’ @entity5 enjoys his @entity24 visits to @entity2			1
this was the @entity8 manager ’s fourth win in five trips			1
here , then , was the @entity35 effectively saying expensively assembled @entity11 were no threat to him on the day or for the rest of the season			1
as @entity8 power on towards the title , problems are piling up for @entity43			1
@entity11 ’s manager has seen @entity8 hurtle past his side to such an extent they have become a dot on the horizon			1
@entity11 are 15 points adrift after 11 matches with no chance of bridging the gap and , for the first time , frustrations among home fans bubbled over			2
losing to @entity8 is bad enough but nothing grates with @entity11 fans more than the realisation that another summer has passed with the club failing to build from what should have been a position of strength			1
the biggest spending spree in their history is taking them backwards			0
@entity67 opened the scoring with his first @entity24 goal for @entity11 @entity43 was forced to endure sounds of discontent from frustrated @entity11 supporters ‘ the supporters have been given a brand of football over two years that they ’ve really clung to , ’ said @entity43 , when asked about the growls from the stands that accompanied his decision to substitute @entity76 and @entity67			1
‘ it has been frustrating and i understand that			0
we brought young players in and they are taking time to gel			0
’ what @entity43 will realise , though , is that @entity11 fans are impatient			1
had they been given the choice , they would have taken the summer @entity8 experienced , when they signed @entity87 and @entity88 to augment their squad			1
‘ we are a better team ( now ) , ’ @entity5 explained			2
‘ we got players to improve the team			0
sometimes you get players to improve the squad , other times you get players to improve the team			0
we got players to improve the team			0
’ @entity11 should have done that			2
they chased @entity103 and made eyes at @entity105 and @entity106 , but again they failed to land a trophy signature			0
@entity110 wheels away in celebration after scoring to bring @entity8 level @entity113 striker @entity87 rifles in the match winner to keep @entity8 clear at the top of the table ‘ we know what targets we wanted but for one reason or another they went elsewhere , ’ said @entity43			1
‘ the club have done everything they could over the summer to get the players to come here			0
early set - pieces for @entity8 clearly showed @entity11 ’s @entity124 holding @entity125 to prevent the @entity8 dangerman challenging for the ball			1
@entity128 chose to ignore the defender ’s infringements			0
‘ players now ... in football terms , i think they look for more			0
they look for all these social factors and f ootball as well			0
say if someone gets offered more money to come here but they want to go to @entity139 , there is not much you can do			0
’ and there was not much they could do about @entity8			2
though can put @entity11 ahead , @entity5 ’s side got stronger as the game went on , looking like a team of men playing against boys			1
@entity87 , scorer of the winning goal , was terrific , as was @entity149 , while @entity150 and @entity110 — who equalised @entity67 ’s effort but was fortunate to escape a late handball — were magnificent			1
@entity125 was referred to as a ' giant ' by @entity5 and was also charged with giving the team talk dwarfing them all , however , was @entity125			2
‘ please give him ( the credit ) he deserves , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ he was signed in the most difficult market for players ( in january ) so the second half of last season was a space of improvement and adaptation			0
at this moment he is a giant			0
not for his size , but the way he plays			0
’ among his many duties , @entity125 gave @entity8 ’s team talk			2
‘ @entity125 said if we wanted to be champions we had to win , ’ @entity169 revealed			0
‘ if the target is to be champions you have to come to these stadiums and get a result			0
’ and from first whistle to last , there was never any doubt that @entity8 would			2
@entity128 made a great case for more technology to be introduced with his performance at @entity2			2
he understandably relied on goal - line technology for @entity8 ’s first goal but missed two clear handballs by @entity110 which replays proved to be deliberate			1
when @entity110 ’s effort was carried marginally over the line by @entity189 , the @entity186 correctly indicated a goal			2
i have no doubt the goal would not have been awarded without the use of the technology			0
@entity196 to understand were his decisions to wave away two penalty appeals for @entity11 , both for handball by @entity110			1
@entity128 should not have needed replays but had they been available he would have had to award penalties .			0

@entity24 leaders @entity8 defeated @entity11 2 - 1 at @entity2
@entity5 claims @entity205 were never troubled even after @entity67 scored the opener for @entity43 ' side
@entity110 equalised before @entity113 @entity87 scored the winner
