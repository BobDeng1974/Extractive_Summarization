@entity0 , who suffered from meningitis himself as a child , has slammed the @entity3 for not introducing a meningitis vaccine , despite it being approved former health minister @entity0 has condemned the government 's two year delay in introducing a vaccine against the last major strain of meningitis because of wrangling over funding			1
@entity11 has one of the highest rates of @entity13 in the world and campaigners have warned that dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials			1
prof @entity0 , who revealed for the first time that he almost died of the disease aged five , has even personally met with @entity22 , the health secretary , to plead with him to introduce the vaccine on the @entity3 as soon as possible			1
he said : ' every parent should be getting the vaccine through the @entity3			0
' the @entity28 vaccine was licensed two years ago and a year later it was backed for @entity3 use by vaccine advisers , who initially declared it would not be cost - effective ' at any price '			1
however the @entity33 did not even enter negotiations with the manufacturers @entity35 until six months ago			1
statistics show one baby dies every month in @entity11 from @entity38 there has been stalemate over the cost of the jab to the @entity3 , which has not been revealed			1
it is available privately at a cost of up to £ 600 in some areas			0
@entity0 , who is patron of the charity @entity46 , said : ' the government eventually decided to make the vaccine available through the @entity3 after a significant amount of lobbying from the charity , including myself in visiting the secretary to state to discuss the matter			1
' i think there has been some delays since the announcement by the secretary of state which are mostly operational			2
' i hope they will be overcome so that the vaccine will be utilised by those in need			0
' he said : ' although i got meningitis at the age of 5 , i still remember it was the least pleasant experience but more importantly i am very fortunately and lucky to be alive			2
' i believe if the @entity3 has approved the vaccine , then every parent should be getting the vaccine through the @entity3 route rather than the costly private alternative			2
' it is feared that if agreement can not be reached soon the process will be further delayed by the @entity74			0
a u-turn by medical advisers to the government last march led to routine vaccination being approved for infants and a one - off catch up programme for babies aged three and four months			2
professor @entity82 , deputy chief medical officer , said at the time : ' we will be working closely with @entity35 in the coming months and , if negotiations are successful , we hope to work with the other @entity11 health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis b as quickly as possible			1
' the @entity28 vaccine was sanctioned for use two years ago , and approved for @entity3 use soon after , but health chiefs only entered talks with suppliers six months ago meningitis now has launched a hard hitting tv advert in an attempt to keep the disease in the forefront of ministers ' minds			1
founder of the charity , @entity101 who lost his baby @entity103 to @entity13 in 1982 , said ' i have waited half my life for this vaccine – it 's a watershed moment in the fight to eradicate the deadly disease			1
' now is the time to act to save our children – one more lost is another heinous and scandalous injustice			0
' on this unwelcome anniversary , i call on government and the vaccine manufacturer to take advantage of the last window of time before the @entity74 to do the right thing			0
' during the last two years there have been 1,130 cases of @entity13 , of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities			1
many of these would have been avoidable if the vaccine had been introduced immediately after it was licensed			0
mr @entity130 added : ' i was sick to my stomach to learn that so many people have died in the two years due to red tape			2
' tragically , in the time , we 've heard of and helped numerous families freshly touched by the disease , which prove this lethargic bureaucracy is costing lives and causing disabilities			2
' a spokesman for @entity35 said ' @entity142 is currently engaged in a procurement process with the @entity11 @entity33 to agree a price for @entity145 to be included on the @entity146			1
' whilst it is not possible to comment on the process , or predict how long it will last , both sides are working to come to an agreement and @entity142 stands ready to supply @entity150 immediately			0
' unfortunately the confidential nature of this process makes it impossible for @entity142 to comment further on any elements of the negotiations			0
' a @entity33 spokesperson said ' we are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease			0
' the @entity161 ( @entity161 ) recommended that a @entity163 vaccine be introduced , but only at a cost - effective price – below the price published by @entity35			0
' we need to make sure @entity3 funds are used effectively and negotiations are continuing			0
