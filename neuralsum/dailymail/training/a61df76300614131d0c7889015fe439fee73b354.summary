by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 6 july 2013 speech : sir @entity2 used the phrase in 1952 it is not every day that @entity5 is described as being churchillian			1
but the chancellor ’s insistence that ‘ we are all in this together ’ when talking about the spending cuts echoes a phrase used by sir @entity2 at a private dinner more than 50 years ago			1
the wartime prime minister said ‘ we ’re all in it together ’ in a speech to tax collectors and former @entity17 of the exchequer about the economic and political threats facing @entity21 in the 1950s			0
until now historians had no idea that @entity2 had ever made the remark			1
but a sound recording of the speech , which was made on may 28 , 1952 , has been found among the politician ’s private record collection – currently being digitised by experts at the @entity29 at the @entity30			1
the recording , which was played for the first time on @entity34 programme @entity35 last night , is one of several @entity2 had privately commissioned for his own benefit			1
in many instances they are the only surviving public record of his attendance at private events			0
historian and @entity2 biographer @entity45 said : ‘ both @entity5 and @entity46 have used a near identical phrase and they are being churchillian without actually realising it			1
‘ of course they were both unaware that @entity2 had ever said it			1
’ @entity2 , who kept his record collection in a mahogany cabinet in the dining room of his @entity56 home , shared his concerns about @entity21 ’s future at a jubilee dinner organised by the @entity60 of @entity62 ’s @entity61			1
favourite phrase : chancellor @entity5 is being unwittingly churchillian every time he uses his mantra he said : ‘ i feel a great burden upon me at my age having seen so much and been through so much			2
‘ not that i can not bear it in the ordinary physical sense but i do see great perils hanging over the country			0
we have all got to fight together for the life of the nation ... our feeling is to some extent alleviated by the fact that we ’re all in it together			0
’ experts say the fact the prime minister was so open about his feelings might mean the speech was impromptu			0
@entity2 becomes more light - hearted as the speech progresses , paying tribute to members of the audience			2
he says the country owes them a debt of gratitude and thanks them for their help ‘ in extracting more and more money from those who guilelessly voted us into office ’			0
nearly identical : @entity46 is also famous for using the phrase in this time of austerity he jokes about his last visit to the association some 25 years earlier , when he was ‘ only ’ chancellor of the exchequer and @entity100 , compared with his new positions as prime minister and @entity103			2
mr @entity45 said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ to learn new things about @entity2 , who died in 1965			2
the record collection also includes a previously unheard recording of a speech @entity2 made to @entity110 personnel at @entity111 in 1951			1
he recalls how he crashed while taking flying lessons in the years leading up to the @entity113			0
he says that his dinner companion on that night thought he looked like ‘ a ghost ’ , before telling the officers : ‘ i suspect you ’ve had many more exciting adventures than that			0
’ there is also a recording of @entity2 explaining to the @entity123 people his decision to sink the country ’s fleet in july 1940 in a bid to stop it falling into enemy hands			1
he speaks in the schoolboy @entity123 he learnt at @entity129			0
mr @entity45 believes that @entity2 kept recordings of his speeches so he could study them to improve his technique			2
but the collection also includes a number of musical and comedy works , including @entity136 ’s @entity137 as well as songs by music hall acts			0
experts at the @entity141 are racing against time to digitise the recordings , which are in a poor state and on the verge of collapse .			0

until now historians had no idea that @entity2 had ever made the remark
recording from 1952 was played for the first time on @entity34
