by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:48 est , 10 february 2014 from music video clips on @entity5 to album plugs on social networking site @entity8 , @entity3 is just a click away on the internet			1
but while she is happy for the public to have access to her on the web , she adopts a different approach when it comes to her children			1
yesterday it emerged the 2013 @entity18 finalist has banned her children from having mobile phones and imposed strict limits on how much tv and internet use they have to protect them from encountering inappropriate images or information			1
rules : @entity3 with her husband @entity27 and son @entity28			1
she has banned her children from using mobile phones and limits the time they spend watching tv the 34 - year - old singer who has three sons : @entity28 , nine , kit , five , and 22 - month - year - old @entity34 with her husband @entity27 , bassist with band @entity37 , admitted they may have been ‘ naïve ’ in the past but they control the internet access their children have at home			1
miss @entity3 said : ‘ we are quite controlled with @entity28 ’s internet use and therefore he is only allowed to use the internet at the weekends			1
‘ because otherwise he would be on it all the time – like some of his friends are			1
he loves gadgets and technology , and is obsessed with it so if we let him on it all the time we would lose days to it			1
‘ my children do n’t have @entity57 – they have one in @entity28 ’s name which we use more as a family thing			1
it ’s locked down and private			0
‘ i think even as an adult when i first got the internet i was too trusting and you do share information you perhaps would n’t tell a stranger in the street or meeting them in a room			2
‘ things like social media , @entity8 , people share their thoughts with the world and think nothing of it			0
‘ there is also a lot of mundane stuff on their too which is like loose sheets of paper it is n’t informative it ’s just stuff			0
children do n’t need that			2
it ’s just unhealthy clutter rather than allowing them to use the internet to explore and find out interesting things			2
’ control : the singer who has three sons : @entity28 , nine , kit , five , and 22 - month - year - old @entity34			1
she admitted they may have been ' naïve ' in the past ‘ it may sound silly but even my baby who is nearly two can touch screens and swipe through pictures , so of course i fear what he could stumble across			0
‘ i want them to be confident with the internet because it ’s part of the world they live in			2
it should n’t intimidate them			0
’ the murder on the @entity109 singer made her comments as she highlighted @entity113 ’s @entity112 internet safety campaign , it starts with you ( subs , please keep )			1
a study commissioned to coincide with it found 80 per cent of parents feel so concerned about online safety they believe it should be taught in schools			1
she has insisted her children will not be given a mobile phone until they start secondary school and only allows them to watch half an hour of television a day			2
however it is their online activity that worries her most : ‘ my five - year - old is constantly asking questions , he sees things on tv or hears things on the radio and he has a question to ask			1
as a parent on some topics you find ways of scooting around them because they are too adult and you answer them appropriately			0
she has insisted her children will not be given a mobile phone until they start secondary school and only allows them to watch half an hour of television a day ‘ online it does n’t work like that , that ‘ do i want them to know that ’ filter is n’t in place			2
‘ if kit was left to his own devices and could write and type then he could find a series of images he finds disturbing			2
‘ i do n’t want him to be looking up anything and not being able to control the result			0
‘ i want them learn about adult subjects in a healthy , controlled manner			0
if you were walking your children into school , you want them to walk into a class with children in the same age group – rather than going straight to the sixth form			0
when they are only little and the same thing applies for the internet			0
‘ it should be used to educate children or allow them to play – it should n’t be a tool which distresses them or cause them to think differently about themselves			0
’ the @entity175 has also been campaigning for safer internet access for our children , including automatic blocks on online porn , with over- 18s able to access adult material only following a strict age verification check			1
last year prime minister @entity183 announced a compromise ‘ default on ’ solution , under which all families will be asked whether a filter should be applied			0
in november the government decided to dramatically accelerate this default , encouraging 20million families to decide whether or not they wished to have access to online pornography			0
the filters , which have been backed my service providers @entity196 and @entity197 , will apply to all devices linked to a home @entity199 and across any public network .			0

@entity18 star limits the time family spend on gadgets
the has three sons : @entity28 , nine , kit , five , and 22 - month - year - old @entity34
children have one @entity57 in @entity28 *'s* name which they use as a family
she made remarks as it is *revealed* 80 *%* of parents are so concerned about internet security it should be taught in schools
