by @entity0 when a man from @entity3 kept having nosebleeds , few people could have predicted the cause			1
the 22 - year - old , who suffered nose bleed at least one a month over three years , had a tooth growing in his nose , a report reveals			1
doctors found a white bony mass measuring half an inch ( 1cm ) long growing in his nasal cavity			1
doctors found a white bony mass measuring half an inch ( 1cm ) long growing in one man 's nasal cavity ( pictured ) which upon closer inspection , dentists proclaimed an extra tooth a dentist explained that extra teeth are not that unusual , but they rarely grow inside the nose			1
up to 3.9 per cent of people have more teeth that usual and they can erupt in unexpected places , according to previous studies			0
around a third of mesiodens ( a common type of extra tooth found near the incisors ) develop upside down and can travel towards the nose			1
no - one is exactly sure why some people have this problem , but the report says : ‘ causes of intranasal teeth include trauma , infection , anatomical malformations , and genetic factors			0
’ extra teeth can appear in the palette as a normal looking extra tooth , or can grow into the nasal cavity in rare cases			1
symptoms of such a problem include a blocked nose , headaches , nose bleeds , foul - smelling mucus and even external deformities of the nose			0
upon seeking advice from dentists , it was confirmed the mass was in fact an extra tooth			1
it was this that was responsible for the bleeding , they added			0
the nosebleeds usually occurred after ‘ minor nasal trauma ’ - or rubbing of the nose - and the patient also frequently had tonsillitis			2
according to the study , ’ an intranasal supernumerary tooth ’ was causing friction in an area of the nasal septum , resulting in bleeding			2
the discovery of the tooth was particularly surprising because the man had a complete and well - aligned set of normal teeth in his mouth , @entity81 reported			2
to solve the problem , doctors from the @entity89 , in @entity90 , put the man under general anaesthetic before pulling out the rogue tooth			1
three months later , the patient ’s nose had healed and his nosebleeds had ceased , according to the report published in the @entity98			2
commenting on the case , dentist dr @entity99 , who is a professor of oral pathology at the @entity101 , told @entity81 that while extra teeth are not that unusual , they rarely grow inside the nose			0
‘ it 's an unusual case of an extra tooth - certainly , the most impressive intranasal photo i think i 've ever seen of one			2
i 've never seen the tooth actually in there			0
’ the discovery of the tooth was particularly surprising because the man had a complete and well - aligned set of normal teeth in his mouth			0
the extra tooth is shown in this ct scan , marked with a red arrow to stop the man 's frequent nose bleeds , doctors put the man under general anaesthetic before pulling out the rogue tooth ( pictured ) the dentist also remarked that it is surprising that the tooth went undetected for so long			1
it is thought that the man may have had a mesioden - a common type of extra tooth found near the incisors			1
