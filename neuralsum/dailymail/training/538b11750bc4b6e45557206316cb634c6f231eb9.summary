a bulldozers finished the job on friday , tearing down the 150 - year @entity15 house in the seaside town of @entity17			1
still standing : the image of the house in @entity17 ripped in half by the winds became a symbol of @entity4 razed : the home was demolished because its owners could not raise enough money to salvage the house demolition took just 15 minutes and was witnessed by @entity28 , who had lived at the house for six months prior to @entity4			1
engineers had told him the house could be saved but he was unable to raise the money needed for its restoration , despite a public appeal			2
he told @entity37 : ' it 's stood as a symbol , i think in a small way			0
it certainly helped to get a lot of attention to the town , a lot of aid to the town , which is good			0
' and it 's a symbol , i think , of a resilience to the hurricane			0
obviously it 's coming down today but this house stood , only maybe half of it but it 's still there and we 're still here			2
coming down : it took a single bulldozer just 15 minutes to raze the house to the ground new start : the owners of @entity62 plan to rebuild a house on the waterfront site ' that 's all i can say really			1
it 's time for it to come down , move forward , rebuild and start a new chapter			0
' he added : ' i do n't want this			0
i would rather if i was going to be on tv and part of history , i would have refered it to be for something good but , it 's a part of like it or not and we have to make the most of it			0
' mr @entity28 ' father @entity82 , who owned the house , told @entity84 the family plan to build another house on the site but said it will not be an exact replica of @entity62			2
he said he knew the house would have to come down , and added : ' i was hoping against hope that i was dead wrong			0
' calm before the storm : princess cottage in @entity15 , @entity17 , before @entity4 resilience : the house remained standing despite half of the building being blown down by @entity4 eye - catching : the striking image of the damaged home helped bring much - needed aid into the area @entity28 continued : ' to see my home away from home , which became my home , destroyed like this - it 's hard to take , it 's just hard to take			1
' the three - storey building remained standing despite the damage for two months after the storm , with its roof incredibly in tact			1
but princess @entity5 is one of around 50 properties in the area whose owners have agreed to raze to the ground			1
@entity4 caused widespread destruction across the eastern @entity11 and parts of the @entity122 - killing more than 250 people and causing 65.6 billion dollars worth of damage			0
