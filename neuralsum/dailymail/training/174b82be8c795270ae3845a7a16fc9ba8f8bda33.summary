@entity3 , 41 from @entity7 was on a private chartered tour to @entity5 when he met a new furry friend on one day during the tour a guide took him to a large penguin rookery with thousands of penguins along a rocky beach			1
@entity3 says , ' our guide explained that we should not approach the wildlife , but that if they approached us that was ok			1
' he said , the smaller you appear to them , the less intimidating you 'll be			0
so he said it was better to kneel or bend down			0
i thought if that was the case , then my best case would simply to be to lay down to make myself very small			2
' as i lay there , the baby penguins became curious			2
' @entity3 is a @entity13 expert for @entity14 and was speaking at a series of technical conferences in area the penguin clambers over his neck and appears completely unfazed as his wing rests over his face in the footage - filmed by @entity3 - a baby penguin approaches him and begins to peck at his head and face			1
the penguin clambers over his neck and appears completely unfazed as his wing rests over his face and he shifts about , gently nuzzling him , before sliding back onto the rocky beach to continue pecking at his hat			1
@entity3 says of the experience , ' as they approached me , i was thinking i need to be very still so i do n't scare them			2
they were so cute with the way they walk with their little wings held back as they waddled			0
@entity3 says : ' as they approached me , i was thinking i need to be very still so i do n't scare them ' while @entity3 was surprised how friendly the little bird was it was n't his first encounter with penguins ' as one approached my head and started pecking around i wondering how sharp their beak was			1
at one point a baby penguin was pecking my forehead and face			0
i was filled with feelings of wonder and awe			0
' the @entity75 technology expert said that the adult penguins kept their distance but the babies were more curious and he did n't notice any hostile or agitated behaviour such as hissing or loud chattering			0
while @entity3 was surprised how friendly the little penguin was it was n't his first encounter with the flightless breed of bird			1
' i 'm lucky in that i 've spent time with penguins including jackass penguins near @entity89 in @entity90 , and on @entity92 with fairy penguins in @entity94 , so this was n't my first time spending time with wild penguins			0
' ' the jackass penguins were very territorial and would nip at you and hiss if you got too close ' you can read more about @entity98 on his travel blog at @entity100			0
