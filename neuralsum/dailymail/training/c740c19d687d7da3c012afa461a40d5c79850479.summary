by @entity1 reporter published : 10:16 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 19 november 2013 noses come in all shapes and sizes but men 's tend to be larger - 10 per cent larger , in fact			1
the reasoning behind this was not fully understood but now scientists think they have solved the mystery - and it is because men need more oxygen than women			0
the research carried out by the @entity16 found that the difference in size comes from the sexes ' different builds and energy demands			1
experts found that the difference in size comes from the sexes ' different builds and energy demands - men have more lean muscle mass males in general have more lean muscle mass , which requires more oxygen for muscle tissue growth and maintenance			1
the size differences become apparent around the age of 11 , when men begin to grow more lean muscle mass and women grow more fat mass. previous research has shown that , during puberty , around 95 per cent of body weight gain in males comes from fat - free mass , compared to 85 per cent in females			1
scientists say the new study also explains why @entity45 had such big noses in comparison to modern humans - they had much more muscle mass. scientists found that male noses grow disproportionately larger than female noses at the beginning at puberty ( pre-pubescent boy pictured top left , pre-pubescent girl pictured top right ; same male pictured in adulthood on bottom left and same female pictured in adulthood , bottom right ) study lead author doctor @entity64 , assistant professor at the @entity65 in the @entity66 , looked at nose size and growth of 38 people of @entity71 research team took external and internal measurements at regular intervals			1
they found that boys and girls generally have the same nose size , from birth until around the age of 11			2
from that point onward , the size difference grew more pronounced			2
doctor @entity64 said : ' this relationship has been discussed in the literature , but this is the first study to examine how the size of the nose relates to body size in males and females in a longitudinal study			2
scientists believe that @entity45 ( reconstruction pictured ) had big noses because they were very muscly ' we have shown that as body size increases in males and females during growth , males exhibit a disproportionate increase in nasal size			1
this follows the same pattern as energetic variables such as oxygenate consumption , basal metabolic rate and daily energy requirements during growth			0
' @entity107 's research also explores why @entity45 had bigger noses than modern humans			1
' so , in humans , the nose can become small , because our bodies have smaller oxygen requirements than we see in archaic humans , ' said doctor @entity64			0
' this all tells us physiologically how modern humans have changed from their ancestors			1
' previous research also appears to support dr @entity64 's findings			0
in a study published in the @entity122 , researchers documented that men 's energy needs are twice those of that of women 's after puberty			2
dr @entity64 also believes that his research , published in the @entity129 , helps us to understand the nose as a ' valuable extension of our lungs '			0
' so , in that sense , we can think of it as being independent of the skull , and more closely tied with non-cranial aspects of anatomy , ' he said			0
' even if the body size is the same , males have larger noses , because more of the body is made up of that expensive tissue			0
and , it 's at puberty that these differences really take off			0
' dr @entity64 says the findings should hold true for other populations , as differences in male and female physiology cut across cultures and races , although further research is needed .			0
