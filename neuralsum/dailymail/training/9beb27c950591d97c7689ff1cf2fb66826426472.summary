@entity0 was a worried man when he drove back down the @entity1 after @entity2 lost a pre-season friendly at @entity4			1
many were expecting his team — with a wage bill bigger than @entity8 ’s and with a plethora of @entity11 stars — to run away with the @entity12 and return to the top flight			1
but after a 1 - 0 defeat by the @entity16 side , @entity0 feared they would tumble down another tier			1
‘ it was a concern , ’ he admits			2
‘ at @entity4 , when i drove down after the game , i thought we ’re going to have a difficult season ; i did n’t like the look of us			2
so , when we started well in the league it gave everyone a lift			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity0 on the play - offs concern : @entity0 admits he was worried about how @entity2 would fare in the championship tall order : the @entity2 boss knew he needed around two points per game to beat @entity36 to finishing top ‘ but i could n’t see us running away with it			1
people always said @entity36 would fall away			2
i did n’t think they would			2
i thought for us to finish above @entity36 we ’re going to need 86 - 87 points — and winning two points a game is never easy			1
’ despite @entity0 ’s fears , @entity2 have not been outside the top five all season			1
they are three games away from winning promotion , starting with the first leg of their play - off at @entity51 on friday			1
but , including loans , 25 players have left the club since last summer			1
‘ a lot of them were good , players you ’d love to have here , ’ he says			2
‘ we could n’t keep them all			2
their wages were too high			0
if @entity65 had stayed , we ’d have got promoted			1
he ’d have got you 25 goals			0
@entity67 has played for @entity68 in the @entity70 semi-final			0
@entity71 ’ve been a big player			0
@entity73 is playing at @entity74			0
they ’ve not exactly gone to bad clubs			0
’ @entity0 says he is in the dark about the financial future if @entity2 do n’t win promotion this year			1
but he is confident they will not lose their star players , with top - flight clubs monitoring @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
squeaky bum time ! @entity2 reached the @entity12 play - offs after finishing fourth in the league goal getter : had @entity65 stayed , @entity2 would have been automatically promoted , claims @entity0 hands off ! @entity0 is confident of keeping hold of his star players , including @entity82 the conversation turns to @entity92			1
the 67 - year - old was the man - in - the - street ’s favourite for the job , before @entity98 was chosen			1
had he been picked , @entity0 would have been preparing for a @entity99 in @entity100 , instead of a friday night in @entity51			1
‘ that seems years ago			0
it ’s way gone , ’ he says			0
i get on well with him			0
i wish him every success			0
i do n’t live my life like that			0
’ even so , he will be watching back home on television			0
‘ i think we ’ll get out of the group , ’ he says			0
‘ i do n’t think it ’s as hard a group as everyone says			0
‘ the draw was decent			2
@entity114 have got @entity115 , @entity116 , the boy @entity115 , but they ’re not overloaded			0
it ’s not a great @entity119 team either			0
we ’ll have a decent run			1
‘ i would n’t say we ’ll win it , i think one of the @entity124 teams will ; the best @entity126 bet is @entity127			0
but we ’ll make the quarter - final and maybe even the semi-final			2
’ it will make more enjoyable viewing for @entity0 if he is plotting a season in the @entity11			1
what could have been : @entity0 was touted to become @entity92 manager before the @entity135 went for @entity98 there can be only one : @entity138 insists @entity2 are under more pressure than his @entity51 side meanwhile , @entity51 manager @entity138 has claimed @entity2 owner @entity141 will be feeling ‘ massive pressure ’ to see his club seal an instant return to the @entity11 , ahead of tonight ’s play - off first leg at the @entity143			1
but after chuckling at @entity0 ’s assertion that @entity51 were favourites to follow @entity148 and @entity36 into the @entity11 , @entity138 suggested @entity141 could ill afford another season in the @entity12 after racking up a wage bill that ’s ‘ three times bigger than ours			1
’ with a @entity154 date against @entity155 or @entity156 at stake , @entity138 said : ‘ what we have is pressure bingo			0
you are under pressure , no you are , and so it goes on			0
’ @entity12 want to hear your funny superstitions — and give you a chance of winning shirts and balls signed by your favourite players			1
