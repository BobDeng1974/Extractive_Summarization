by @entity0 a person 's wealth is a key indicator of the type of cancer they are likely to suffer from , scientists say			0
@entity9 researchers have discovered that certain types of cancers are prevalent in different classes			1
they say more affluent people are likely to suffer from melanoma , thyroid and testicular cancers			1
poorer people , on the other hand , are more likely to be diagnosed with cancers of the larynx , cervix , penis , and liver			1
class divide : more affluent people are likely to suffer from skin cancer - including melanoma - thyroid and testicular cancers and while these people are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer , they are more likely to die from the disease			1
dr @entity31 , of the @entity32 , said : ' at first glance , the effects seem to cancel one another out			2
' when it comes to cancer , the poor are more likely to die of the disease while the affluent are more likely to die with the disease			2
' the study , published online in the journal @entity42 , looked at the richest and poorest neighbourhoods covering over two fifths of the @entity9 population			0
researchers assigned nearly three million tumours diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 into one of four groupings based on the poverty rate of the residential census at the time of diagnosis			0
certain cancers - @entity55 sarcoma and cancers of the larynx , cervix , penis , and liver - were more likely in the poorest neighborhoods , while other cancers - melanoma , thyroid and testis - were more likely in the wealthiest neighborhoods			1
dr @entity31 added : ' our hope is that our paper will illustrate the value and necessity of doing this routinely in the future			0
' new research : the study found those who were worse off were more prone to suffering liver cancer , as well as forms of the disease affecting the larynx , penis and cervix previous research from @entity85 found that well - off women are more likely to suffer from skin cancer			1
in the @entity9 , more than 90 per cent of the most deadly skin cancers – malignant melanomas – occur in the white population			0
the researchers found that young women are at highest risk for malignant melanoma if they live in neighbourhoods that are both more well - to - do and sunnier			2
other research from the @entity97 in @entity98 found that middle - class people are significantly more likely to develop breast and skin cancer than the less well off			0
the researchers suggested that career women delaying having children and exposing themselves more to the sun on foreign holidays are thought to be behind the gap			0
they added that social deprivation is linked to lung and cervical cancer , as less affluent people are more likely to smoke and miss smear tests .			2

researchers at @entity32 discovered certain types of cancers are more prevalent in different classes
more affluent suffer from melanoma , thyroid and testicular cancers
while poorer people suffer larynx , cervix , penis and liver forms of disease
