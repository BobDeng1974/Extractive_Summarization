by @entity0 there may be times when you really want to tell your colleagues what you think of them , but are left biting your tongue			0
the free app lets you anonymously pit co-workers against each other based on how good they are at their job , and their personality traits - and will rate them on each quality			1
the @entity7 app pits two people against each other using a range of questions			1
some are work related , while others assess personality traits , such as ' who would leave work early for a date ? ' ( pictured left ) and ' who would pack for a trip way in advance ? ' each time a user is rated ( pictured right ) , they are sent a notification examples include ‘ who would leave work early for a date ? ’ , ‘ who is more assertive ? ’ and ‘ who would pack for a trip way in advance ? ’ researchers at the @entity41 and @entity42 recently discovered that people who moan a lot may be better at their jobs			1
this is because the so - called ' haters ' may be more skilled because they spend time on fewer activities			2
in contrast , people with a sunny disposition tend to spread their time over lots of activities			2
this , the researchers claim , makes them a ' @entity57 ' and a master of none			0
the user then selects the best match , before being given another question and two possible colleagues			0
colleagues are selected at random			0
each of the questions are designed to be ‘ positive and upbeat ’ – meaning users ca n't be brutally honest with people they do n’t like			1
however , they could rate other colleagues higher at the detriment of those they do n’t get on with			0
each time a user is rated , they get a notification saying what they were rated for			1
these ratings are saved and shown on their profile , which reveals their strongest traits , based on the answers			2
at least seven people from a firm need to sign up to the app before they can begin rating each other			1
this is done to protect each user ’s identity			0

a recent survey found that having the right skills is an important part of being considered for a job , but possessing the right personality traits is apparently even more essential			1
in digital education company @entity115 's study of 500 business leaders , 78 per cent cited ' personality ' as the most desirable quality in an employee			0
and the top traits in this category were found to be ' driven ' , ' creative ' and ' open - minded '			2
the most important quality after personality , according to the survey , is ' cultural alignment '			0
a person 's skill - set was rated the third most important quality , with just 39 per cent of the vote .			0
