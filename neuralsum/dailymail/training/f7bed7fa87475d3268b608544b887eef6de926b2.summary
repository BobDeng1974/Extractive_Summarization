last year @entity0 came under fire for its outdated representation of @entity4 culture with its launch of @entity6 who wore bright pink traditional dress and had a @entity9 tucked under her arm			1
however this does n't appear to have deterred the toy giant who has now launched their latest doll in traditional mariachi dress complete with wide brimmed sombrero and embellished suit			1
according to the general manager of @entity19 , @entity21 launch of the @entity22 comes a month prior to the celebration of the national day of @entity19 ( 15 september )			1
@entity6 's latest nationality will be a @entity4 as @entity0 launch the toy in traditional mariachi dress @entity6 takes on a full transformation wearing a fitted black bolero jacket and cropped trousers trimmed in intricate golden brocade that mirrors the pattern on her impressive , wide - brimmed sombrero			1
flourishes include a brilliant pink tie , low ponytail and tall black boots			0
however , @entity0 's latest offering comes as a bit of a risk as @entity6 's previous venture into @entity4 culture caused huge controversy			1
last april , the toy company sparked controversy with the launch of its first @entity6 criticised for adhering to outdated and offensive stereotypes			1
outdated or educational ? could @entity0 's latest @entity4 @entity6 cause as much controversy as their previous offering ? @entity6 wore a bright pink ' traditional ' dress and held a @entity9 , sparking a debate over whether the dolls are helpful or harmful to cultural awareness in children			1
she was part of @entity0 's @entity62 collection			1
initially introduced in 1980 , the line was relaunched in 2012 as @entity0 's attempt to appeal to a new generation of diverse @entity6 fans			2
@entity67 , a spokesman for @entity0 , told @entity68 that the toys - which represent countries including @entity19 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 - are educational tools for young children			2
' girls enjoy exploring the world and learning about different cultures through play , ' she explained , adding : ' the @entity6 brand understands the significance of introducing new cultures to girls in a relatable way			0
' under fire : the @entity62 collection - and , in particular , the @entity9 - toting @entity6 ( left ) - was criticised for promoting cultural stereotypes			1
@entity88 ( right ) comes with a baby panda nonetheless , the multicultural dolls have incited criticism for their apparently simplistic portrayals of different heritages			0
@entity94 , chairman of the @entity95 , said of the toys : ' these images seem very dated and seem to have been created for a different time			0
' indeed , most of the dolls are marketed on the @entity0 website as sporting ' traditional ' costumes and ' classic ' looks			2
despite their latest @entity6 being described as wearing ' traditional costume ' it appears that the doll may not be entirely authentic			0
on the @entity110 website under @entity111 the doll 's skin tone is listed as @entity113 tan - not exactly a perfect likeness to an actual @entity4 woman			1
mr @entity94 added that @entity0 could improve the collection by adding more contemporary representations of the countries			2
all of the @entity119 are dressed in their ' native fashions ' , according to ms @entity67 , and they each carry a passport and a pet that is meant to represent their heritage			0
cultural heritage : @entity128 ( left ) , @entity129 ( middle ) and @entity131 ( right ) all sport apparently traditional native outfits			0
@entity131 carries a monkey on her arm cute or cliched ? @entity137 is decked out in luau attire and accompanied by a tortoise ( left ) while @entity140 has red hair and wears an old - fashioned green dress ( right ) critics of the dolls have said that they represent cliched perceptions of different cultures			0
website @entity147 said of the collection : ' apparently no one from @entity0 has ever set foot outside the @entity151 - possibly not outside of @entity154 ’s rather aged it ’s a @entity153 exhibit			2
' and a blogger for the @entity156 expressed her disapproval of @entity6 : ' if you really have to do the old - fashioned , traditional dress , why not at least make it accurate ? ' she wrote			0
furry friends : the dolls each carry a pet that is meant to represent their respective countries			0
@entity165 for instance ( middle ) cradles a koala bear in her arm , and @entity171 ( right ) is accompanied by a bunny with @entity0 's latest offering based , once again on traditional @entity4 dress , the @entity6 brand could once again come under fire for its stereotypical approach to world cultures			1
however , @entity0 defends the @entity179 as representations of genuine and unique qualities of countries around the globe			0
' @entity185 collection features the native fashions , while celebrating the cultures and diversity represented within each country in a way that will appeal to @entity6 fans of all ages , ' asserted ms @entity67 .			0

@entity0 has launched a second @entity22 in their doll range
