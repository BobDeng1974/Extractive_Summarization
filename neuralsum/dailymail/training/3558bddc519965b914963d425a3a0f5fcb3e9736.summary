by @entity0 published : 13:14 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 24 january 2013 spectacular pictures of the @entity3 's 90 - mile high solar eruptions have been captured in the highest ever resolution by @entity6 scientists			1
the images of the star 's outer atmosphere provide evidence of magnetic ' braids ' believed to heat this region up to four million degrees @entity13			1
they occur when small bundles of magnetic field become wrapped around each other because of the swirling of plasma on the @entity3 's surface			1
highest ever resolution : this incredible image of the @entity3 's swirling outer atmosphere provide evidence of magnetic ' braids ' believed to heat this region up to four million degrees @entity13 the new study published in @entity26 shows these dynamic 90 - mile high structures provide the energy to heat the sun 's corona			1
it is now apparent there are at least two heating mechanisms at work including a process known as electromagnetic waves that penetrate the plasma and transfer their energy to the constituent particles			0
but additional heating needed for corona to become superheated is caused by the unravelling and reformation of the magnetic braids			1
this theory is supported by the observations made by astrophysicist dr @entity48 , of @entity6 's @entity49 in @entity50 , and colleagues			0
they used the high - resolution @entity53 ( @entity55 ) launched on a rocket last july that obtained roughly five minutes of data before re-entering @entity59 's atmosphere			2
the extreme - ultraviolet telescope looks at coronal plasma with temperatures of around 1.5 million degrees @entity13 - and has a resolution five times higher than previously achieved			0
@entity64 in high contrast : the ' braids ' occur when small bundles of magnetic field become wrapped around each other because of the swirling of plasma on the @entity3 's surface dr @entity48 said the magnetic braids in an active region of the corona are seen to be reconnecting , relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to 4million degrees celsius			1
he said : ' it is now apparent there are at least two heating mechanisms in the @entity3 's outer atmosphere or corona '			1
' @entity85 may be the prevalent mechanism in quiet solar periods and may contribute to heating the corona to @entity13			0
a collage of solar images from @entity6 's @entity90 ( @entity90 ) shows how @entity6 has captured the solar surface in different wavelengths previous images of the sun taken by the @entity90 craft have captured massive ' solar storms ' and magnetic activity on the solar surface ' the active corona needs additional heating to reach 2,000,000 - 4,000,000 c - this heat has been theoretically proposed to come from the reconnection and unravelling of magnetic ' braids '			2
' here we report observations of magnetic braids in a coronal active region that are reconnecting , relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to about @entity110			2
' although our 5 - minute observations can not unambiguously identify the field reconnection and subsequent relaxation as the dominant heating mechanism throughout active regions , the energy available from the observed field relaxation in our example is ample for the observed heating			0
' the launch of the @entity55 sounding rocket : researchers used the high - resolution @entity53 ( @entity55 ) launched last july that obtained roughly five minutes of data before re-entering @entity59 's atmosphere space scientist professor @entity126 , of @entity127 , reviewed the study for the journal and said there is ' a wealth of data ' to be analysed even from five minutes of observations			2
he said : ' the next stage is securing @entity55 , or an instrument with similar or improved performance , on an orbiting spacecraft			0
' this spacecraft must also carry a modern extreme - ultraviolet spectrometer - both to complement @entity55 and to provide fundamental plasma measurements of density , temperature , velocities and small - scale turbulence - as well as an instrument capable of measuring signatures of energetic particles , which are known to be a significant product of the magnetic - reconnection process			0
' only with such complete instrumentation can a proper understanding of coronal structures be attained			0

pictures provide evidence of magnetic ' braids ' that play a key role in heating the @entity3 's atmosphere
they occur when the swirling of plasma in the @entity3 's surface wraps magnetic fields around each other
