by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:51 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:09 est , 26 february 2014 it may look like something a @entity7 villain would conjure up as a base for their evil regime , but this research vessel set to be stationed in the middle of the ocean is actually a marine research facility - and it is set to become a reality			1
called @entity16 , the floating aquatic lab has been designed by @entity19 architect @entity18 , who announced that production was about to begin on the project , which will take two years to build			1
' i 'm really glad to announce that we have reached our goal , ' he said after the project raised over $ 440,000			0
it has a platform lift for divers on the left - hand side , while stern thrusters power the ship			0
bunks for the crew as well as the vip cabin and @entity41 's room are on the right - hand side			0
the retractable keel weighs 180 tonnes @entity19 architect @entity18 designed the incredible structure			1
a countdown on the @entity16 site claims construction will start in 201 days , which would make the start 31 may 2014			2
the project will cost $ 52.7 million and has support from @entity50 and the @entity51 because the conditions on the @entity16 are similar to those found in space			0
the 1,000 tonne vessel is 170ft tall but almost two thirds of this will be underwater , between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on the hybrid boat laboratory			1
it will be the only vessel allowing 24 - hour exploration			0
this will allow construction of the vessel ’s ‘ eye ’ , a kind of lookout post that sits 18 metres high above the water , to begin			2
' more than 600 people contributed , and now we are able to start on construction , ' said @entity18			0
' when in two years @entity16 is built , we hope all out backers will come with us			0
' almost two - thirds of the 170 - ft tall ship will sit underwater making it possible to directly study ecosystems and fish levels at great depths			1
between 18 and 22 marine biologists will be able to live on board the vessel at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens			1
the laboratory part of the 1,000 - tonne ship will sit below the surface to make the @entity16 buoyant , but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean to depths of up to 6,000 metres			1
according to @entity18 , the @entity16 will additionally feature a ‘ fish - collection system for studies of the pelagic ecosystem , plankton biodiversity , and fish stocks			2
’ architect @entity18 developed the concept of the ocean lab around 12 years ago			0
he built his first underwater house on 4 august 1977			0
in 1981 he launched the @entity103 , a scientific base suspended in mid-water that slept two people			0
the @entity107 was capable of diving to depths of around 12 metres and could stay underwater for between seven and 15 days at a time			0
called @entity16 , the 1,000 - tonne floating aquatic lab , pictured , was designed by @entity19 architect @entity18			1
construction on the ship is due to start in may 2014			0

@entity18 said : ‘ @entity16 is the only vessel in the world allowing a 24 - hour exploration on long - term missions of the open sea and the abyss			2
’ this computer generated image shows what the @entity16 will look like underwater			2
the @entity19 - designed ship will be able to explore depths of around 6,000 metres			1
between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on board at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens this is how the @entity16 is expected to look from the ocean floor			1
the laboratory part of the ship , pictured , will sit below the surface to make the @entity16 buoyant , but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean it is also environmentally friendly and sustainable because it is powered using solar , wind and wave energy			1
although the @entity16 has been designed to drift with ocean currents , the @entity164 and @entity165 systems ( @entity166 ) is also said to be developing a biofuel that could be used as a secondary power source			2
previously @entity18 told @entity169 that the @entity16 : ‘ would become an essential tool in exploring the world ’s oceans and an useful base to study the link between global warming and the oceans , which absorb about a quarter of all carbon emissions			0

construction on the marine research facility called @entity16 set to begin after online funding campaign
two - thirds of the 170 - ft tall vessel will sit underwater to give it buoyancy and offer a direct line of sight to the ocean
between 18 and 22 marine biologists will be able to study ecosystems and fish levels on board at any one time
the @entity19 - designed craft weighs 1,000 tonnes and will be powered by wind , wave and solar energy
