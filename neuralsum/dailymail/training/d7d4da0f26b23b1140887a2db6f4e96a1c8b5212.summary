@entity0 may be a well - known music - lover , but he is happy to avoid @entity3 's sprawling nightclubs he may be a well - known music - lover having hosted high - profile shows on @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
but @entity0 reveals he more than happy to shun the masses of @entity3 's hard - partying tourists , booming beats and sprawling nightclubs to take a trip to the north of the island , which is littered with breath - taking beaches			1
the 35 - year - old presenter says the @entity19 island has ' two characters ' explaining the tranquil villages and peaceful orange groves are just a bike - ride away and offer the opportunity to ' live like a local '			1
read our q and a with @entity0 to find out how he spends his time on the island			1
many people are cautious of visiting @entity3 as they think it 's all about clubbing and rowdy youngsters			2
but what else has the island got to offer ? ' @entity3 is an island of two characters ; the south which is devoted to the mega clubs and party - goers and the other , lesser known @entity39 side of the island , which is peaceful , tranquil and full of unspoilt beauty			1
of course , the boundaries are n't as clear cut as this , but for every all - night dj session there is an early morning sunrise at one of the many breath - taking little coves that litter the @entity49			1
the nightlife may have gained a reputation for the island amongst tourists , but it 's this other side to @entity3 that the locals rave about			1
if you are one of the 50 per cent of @entity56 who , according to research by @entity58 , are after the authentic experience of ' living like a local ' , then the best way to explore this quieter side of the island is to hop on a bike and get off the beaten track to explore the many villages , peaceful orange groves and quaint little restaurants that tourists do n't usually get to experience			1
i guarantee you wo n't hear a baseline the whole time you are there			2
' @entity0 recommends escaping @entity3 's crowded clubbing areas and visiting the island 's northern coast			1
beaches such as @entity78 ( pictured ) can be found on the @entity79 of @entity3 best restaurant ? ' my favourite restaurant on the island is a little family owned place called @entity85 in the centre of the small town of @entity88			1
it 's got a quiet courtyard outside where you can just sit , relax , eat , drink and let time pass you by without a care			0
all the food is vegetarian and organic with fresh fruit juices and , in my opinion , the best homemade pizza on the island			1
' best beach ? ' picking my favourite beach in @entity3 is a bit of a tricky one			0
if i did have to choose though , it would probably be @entity104			0
it felt like i was on a tropical beach without the long - haul flying			1
with great views and white sand , combined with a few fisherman 's huts and a tiny kiosk serving food , it was the perfect place to escape from it all			1
' great outdoors : @entity0 loves the party side of @entity3 but also enjoys going out exploring best place to stay ? ' if you are going in search of sunset bike rides and early morning strolls around the old towns , then i 'd advise staying in any one of the boutique hotels in the north of the island , like the @entity128 , with its series of spa pools and waterfalls built into the cliff face			1
we stayed in can @entity135 and it 's safe to say that that the view from the breakfast table made the early starts much better			0
' your favourite thing about @entity3 and why ? ' my favourite thing about @entity3 is discovering the hidden gems of the island			2
when you say to people you are heading on holiday to @entity3 , they immediately imagine rows of sun beds on the beaches and overcrowded bars blasting out music			2
yet you only need to venture a little off the tourist trails and , even in peak season , you can find stunning , empty beaches and relaxing places to sit for a drink			1
perhaps the island 's reputation has meant less people visit @entity3 in search of a rejuvenating holiday			2
for whatever the reason , they 're missing out			0
' the ultimate island guide : @entity0 produced his quick guide to what is great about @entity3 what are your packing essentials ? ' packing light is the key if , like me , you enjoy moving around a lot			2
there 's nothing worse than heaving a giant case jammed full of clothes to lug on and off various forms of transport			0
as long as you 've got one smart outfit in there and the facilities to clean it you 'll be fine			0
and if you do n't have the facilities to clean it , you 're probably not in a place you 're going to need it in the first place			2
' which destination is top of your wishlist ? ' i 'd like to explore more of @entity193			0
i 've seen a lot of @entity195 : @entity196 , @entity197 and up to @entity198 and then deep into the rain forest , but that 's it			0
i 'd really like to go further south to @entity200			0
' what is your earliest travel memory ? ' @entity204			0
i remember being in @entity204 so much as a kid			0
my mum often took myself and my brother to stay on the @entity208			0
we spent time on @entity210 , around @entity211 and @entity212 and then on the banks of @entity214			0
it is still one of my favourite places in the world to spend time … stunning scenery , wild weather and fascinating history			2
