blastoff for the spacecraft which could one day take humans to @entity3 is set for the final countdown as @entity5 begins assembling the giant rockets that will propel it into orbit			1
the huge @entity10 rocket has been put together for the first time at @entity12 in @entity13 ahead of a first test flight of the @entity16 capsule in december			1
it will blast the experimental capsule in orbit - although the rockets are then expected to be replaced by @entity5 's even bigger space launch system			1
the three @entity24 were attached in @entity26 's @entity25 ( @entity27 ) , at @entity12 in @entity13 during its dec. 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity33 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the @entity35 off the @entity37 coast			0
the entire mission will last 4½ hours			0
the three primary core elements of the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) @entity10 rocket have now been put together , forming the first stage of the launch vehicle that will send @entity16 far from @entity33 to allow @entity5 to evaluate the spacecraft 's performance in space			1
the three @entity24 were attached in @entity26 's @entity25 ( @entity27 ) , at @entity12 in @entity13			0
the @entity27 building is located at @entity47 where the mission will lift off			0
the first booster was attached to the center rocket in june with the second one was attached in early august			0
' the day - to - day processing is performed by @entity26 , ' said @entity53 of @entity5 's @entity54 of the @entity55 ( @entity55 )			1
' @entity5 's role is to keep a watchful eye on everything and be there to help if any issues come up			1
' @entity53 explained that during major testing experts from @entity5 's @entity55 monitor the work on consoles in @entity64 at @entity12			1
@entity65 is home to the @entity68 's upgraded @entity67			0
the facility allows engineers to monitor voice , data , telemetry and video systems that support expendable launch vehicle missions			0
in the @entity25 at @entity12 , two core elements of a @entity10 rocket are brought together in preparation for @entity23 - 1			1
@entity26 technicians prepare the second stage of a @entity10 rocket for mating to the central core booster of the three booster stages for the unpiloted @entity23 - 1			1
the three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter			0
each has an rs - 68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust			2
all totaled , the three @entity10 boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust			1
the second stage of the @entity10 rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter			2
it uses one @entity99 engine , also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust			2
@entity5 's @entity13 spaceport is also where @entity16 was built and is being processed			1
the @entity10 rocket stages were assembled at the @entity26 plant in @entity106 , @entity107 , about 20 miles west of @entity108			2
after completion , the rocket components were shipped down the @entity111 and @entity112 , a canal , to the @entity113			0
from there they traveled to @entity12 , arriving on may 6			0
the elements of the rocket 's first stage were then transported to the @entity27 for preflight processing			0
' after the three core stages went through their initial inspections and processing , the struts were attached , connecting the booster stages with the center core , ' @entity53 said			0
' all of this takes place horizontally			0
' the three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter			0
each has an rs - 68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust			2
all totaled , the three @entity10 boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust			1

it uses one @entity99 engine , also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust			2
the @entity147 rocket that will blast the capsule into orbit will be the largest ever built ' the second stage was taken to the @entity151 for processing after it arrived , ' said @entity53			0
' the second stage was moved to the @entity27 on aug. 29 and is scheduled to be horizontally mated to the first stage on sept. 12			0
' the same upper stage will be used on the block 1 version of @entity5 's new heavy - lift rocket , the @entity147 ( @entity147 )			2
more powerful than any rocket ever built , @entity147 will be capable of sending humans aboard @entity16 to deep - space destinations such as an asteroid and @entity3			2
' the hardware for @entity163 is coming together well , ' @entity53 said			0
' we have n't had to deal with any serious problems			0
all of the advance planning appears to be paying off			0
' once all the launch vehicle stages are mated and thoroughly checked out , the next step is the @entity169			0
@entity171 divers adjust a tow line on a test version of the capsule as it is towed towards the @entity175 during a recovery drill off the coast of @entity178 ' these meetings are held to bring together all the interested parties to be sure the @entity10 rocket is ready for the move to the launch pad where the @entity16 spacecraft will be mated , ' @entity53 said			1
the upcoming flight test will use the @entity10 to launch the @entity16 and send it 3,600 miles in altitude beyond the @entity33 's surface			1
during the two - orbit , four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety , the launch abort system , the heat shield and the parachute system			0
the data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models			0
the flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later @entity16 flights			1
the capsule will re-enter @entity33 's atmosphere at speeds approaching 20,000 mph , generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees @entity208 , before splashing down in the @entity35			0
@entity5 's @entity16 spacecraft departs the @entity210 on its way to the @entity212 at the @entity68			1
@entity16 is scheduled for a test flight in early december			1
the @entity214 - built @entity16 is designed to take humans farther than ever before			2
the spacecraft will serve as the exploration vehicle that will carry astronauts to space and provide safe re-entry from deep - space missions			0
@entity16 currently is undergoing final assembly in @entity68 's @entity210			2
@entity53 is especially invested in a successful outcome for the flight test			2
' what i 'm looking forward to most , ' she said , ' is seeing that @entity16 capsule being retrieved from the @entity35			1
' during its dec. 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space and take two big laps around @entity33 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the @entity35 off the @entity37 coast			1
the entire mission will last 4½ hours			0
the second @entity16 flight wo n't occur until around 2018 when another unmanned capsule soars atop @entity5 's new megarocket , still under development , called @entity147 for @entity147			1
a test version of @entity5 's @entity16 capsule is shown after being recovered by the @entity175 off the coast of @entity178 in september @entity5 intends to put astronauts aboard @entity16 in 2021 for deep space exploration ; each capsule can accommodate up to four			1
the plan is to use @entity16 for getting humans to asteroids and @entity3 — no space station ferry trips for @entity16			2
while @entity16 may resemble an oversize @entity251 capsule on the outside , everything inside and out is modern and top - of - the - line , officials noted thursday			1
' i 'm as excited as can be , ' said @entity5 's @entity16 production operations manager , @entity255			1
for @entity16 's dry run , the @entity214 - built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			1
a @entity10 rocket will do the heavy lifting			2
it will eventually be launced by @entity5 's new @entity147 ' megarocket '			0
for its first flight test , @entity147 will be configured for a 70 - metric - ton ( 77 - ton ) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed @entity16 spacecraft beyond low - earth orbit			1
in its most powerful configuration , @entity147 will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , which will enable missions even farther into our solar system , including such destinations as an asteroid and @entity3			0
@entity5 's @entity16 spacecraft , preparing for it 's first flight , arrives at the @entity212 at the @entity68 when asked by a reporter , @entity281 said he wishes @entity16 's flight pace was quicker			1
' but it is what it is , ' he said			0
' given the budget that we have , i think we 've got the best program that you could imagine			0
' @entity16 has its roots in the @entity294 shuttle era ; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low @entity33 orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the @entity300 project .			1

three @entity10 boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust
@entity16 capsule will undergo first test flight in december
comes as @entity5 *bosses* *reveal* *private* contracts for shuttle replacement so they can concentrate on the project
