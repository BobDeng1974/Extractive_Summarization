@entity0 , the first woman to helm the @entity1 , resigned on wednesday following two embarrassing episodes over just three days that underscored the once - respected agency 's struggle to protect the president and the @entity7			1
a bitter @entity8 gave an exit interview in which she claimed resigning with her agency in tatters was ' the noble thing to do , ' and blamed news outlets for the quick collapse of her job			1
' the media has made it clear that this is what they expected , ' she told @entity20			1
@entity8 faced a hostile panel of lawmakers on tuesday who demanded a better showing from the nation 's top bodyguards after a mentally ill veteran scaled the @entity7 fence on sept. 19 and scampered more than 100 feet into the building , with a knife in his pocket , before agents tackled him			1
' it 's unacceptable , ' @entity8 conceded , but even president @entity35 's allies would hear none of it			1
' i wish to @entity41 you protected the @entity7 like you protected your reputation here today , ' @entity39 @entity38 rep. @entity37 barked at her			2
hot seat : @entity0 absorbed endless flak from @entity47 and @entity38 alike on tuesday during a contentious @entity49 hearing guarded : @entity8 had her own personal protection detail when she arrived to testify before @entity51 on tuesday shortly after the hearing , news emerged that on sept. 16 an armed private security guard was allowed on an elevator with president @entity35 during his visit to the @entity57 in @entity58			1
his @entity1 detail was n't aware the man was carrying a gun			1
@entity0 told @entity20 that her ouster was in part driven by news outlets ' demands for her head			0
' the media has made it clear that this is what they expected , ' she said , since ' @entity51 has lost confidence in my ability to run the agency			1
' but she concluded that ' it ’s in the best interest of the @entity1 and the @entity78 public if i step down			2
' ' i can be pretty stoic about it , but not really , ' the spurned forner @entity1 chief told @entity20			2
' it 's painful to leave as the agency is reeling from a significant security breach			2
' @entity8 said she spoke to homeland security secretary @entity86 ' in person ' at his office , and ' and after that discussion i felt this was the noble thing to do			1
' her resignation , she added , will ' take pressure off the organization			0
' ' in any organization , people are going to make a mistake , ' she added , talking about the specialized bodyguard service that protects the lives of presidents and their families			0
' but it ’s important for the public to know that this organization is going to maintain a high degree of standards			0
' calls for @entity8 's ouster began to filter out to reporters within hours , beginning with @entity113 @entity38 rep. @entity112 , who walked back that demand on wednesday morning			1
by then , however , @entity7 minority leader @entity115 had jumped on a moving train and said @entity8 should step down			1
several other members of @entity51 , mostly in the @entity118 , had insisted on the formation of a blue - ribbon panel to probe the @entity1 's lapses			2
those demands are not likely to quiet down even after @entity8 's replacement is chosen			2
@entity125 @entity124 rep. @entity124 , who chairs the @entity126 – the site of tuesday 's legislative bloodbath – said wednesday that the resignation ' does not resolve ' all the @entity131 's problems , some of which ' pre-date ms. @entity0 ’s tenure as director			2
' ' yesterday , the @entity126 called for an outside review by independent experts , ' he said			0
' today , @entity136 @entity86 today agreed that such a review is critical			0
' @entity8 told @entity20 that it was ' in the best interest of the @entity1 and the @entity78 public if i step down			1
@entity51 has lost confidence in my ability to run the agency			2
the media has made it clear that this is what they expected			1
' ' i can be pretty stoic about it , but not really , ' she said			0
' it 's painful to leave as the agency is reeling from a significant security breach			0
' that breach outraged sen. @entity154 , a @entity156 @entity155 who chairs the @entity157 in the upper chamber of @entity51			0
he said an ' obvious dissonance that exists within an agency ' was apparent because it could ' secure an event with over 100 world leaders at the @entity163 in @entity164 for nearly three weeks without apparent incident , but simultaneously fail to keep an intruder from running into the @entity7			2
' @entity35 appointed @entity8 last year as pushback against perceptions that the service was becoming a boys'club			1
about 90 per cent of the 3,500 agents are male , and some of them were caught engaging prostitutes during an advance trip before @entity35 's 2012 trip to the @entity78 nation of @entity177			0
having a woman at the helm was thought to be a salve for the agency 's suddenly scandalized public image			0
a veteran with @entity184 scaled a @entity7 fence on sept. 19 and made it 168 feet into the presidential mansion before an off - duty agent happened to see him and brought him to the ground @entity7 press secretary @entity189 told reporters on wednesday that the president and his inner circle were unaware of the elevator lapse at the @entity57 until ' just minutes ' before the @entity194 broke the story tuesday afternoon			1
@entity189 would n’t say whether @entity8 herself told @entity35 , or the @entity7 learned of it from the media			1
but ' my only knowledge of this is based on public reports , ' @entity189 admitted			0
@entity204 @entity203 rep. @entity203 claimed in an interview with the @entity206 that the man on the elevator was a convicted felon , but a @entity1 source later told the @entity210 that he was never prosecuted following an arrest for @entity212			2
' you have a convicted felon within arm 's reach of the president and they never did a background check , ' an angry @entity203 said			0
' words are n't strong enough for the outrage i feel for the safety of the president and his family			0
' ' his life was in danger			0
this country would be a different world today if he had pulled out his gun			0
' the man , a private security guard , was stopped for questioning because he refused to stop taking a cell - phone video of the @entity35 during the elevator ride			1
his supervisors suspended him on the spot and demanded he turn over his firearm – shocking @entity1 agents who were n't aware he was armed			1
better days : @entity35 had high praise for the first female @entity1 director when he appointed her less than 18 months ago jumper : @entity245 pleaded ' not guilty ' wednesday in federal court , despite video footage of him scaling the @entity7 fence and eluding @entity1 as heran into the president 's executive mansion while carrying a knife in his pocket @entity189 said @entity8 met wednesday with homeland security secretary @entity86 , who ' accepted her resignation , which she offered because it ' was in the ' best interest of the agency			1
' ‘ the secretary agreed with that assessment			0
the president did as well , ’ @entity189 said			0
‘ the president concluded that new leadership of that agency was required			0
’ but he would n't directly comment on the scandal unfolding over the elevator incident			1
having an armed man in an elevator with the @entity270 was a ' serious breach , ' and ‘ unwise and unacceptable , ’ he said , but he said further comment would have to wait until after an investigation is completed			1
' the president has nothing but the highest regard for the men and women of the @entity1 , ' @entity189 told reporters			2
@entity189 also would n't say whether or not other heads would roll			0
but after the @entity282 conducts its own probe , he said , ' the president believes that an independent panel should review the results of this assessment ... to determine what steps are appropriate moving forward			0
' in a statement , @entity86 said : '' i salute her 30 years of distinguished service to the @entity1 and the nation			2
' @entity8 told @entity20 of her resignation that she had ' met in person ' with @entity86 , ' and after that discussion i felt this was the noble thing to do ' because it would ' take pressure off the organization			1
' @entity189 said there is no immediate timetable for @entity8 's permanent replacement , which will require @entity118 confirmation			2
and in this corner ... @entity8 ( center ) shook hands with @entity126 chairman @entity47 @entity124 before her dressing - down , as ranking @entity155 @entity112 looked on ; he would later call for her ouster and then withdraw the demand just hours before @entity8 resigned @entity312 , a retired special agent , is ' a good candidate for serving as acting director until a more permanent replacement can be found , ' @entity189 said			1
he also revealed that @entity312 is taking a ' leave of absence from his private sector job ' to run the @entity1 in the interim			1
' the president is grateful that he has taken on that very significant responsibility , ' @entity189 told reporters			0
@entity8 studied criminal justice at the @entity322 and served for three years with the @entity323			0
she was among the first female officers assigned to a beat on that force			0
she served on the @entity328 for president @entity329 , and was put in charge of overseeing protective details for presidents @entity332 and @entity334			0
moving her up the chain of command made sense on paper in april 2013 : @entity8 was already serving as chief of staff to then - director @entity339			1
her working life started in a less - serious way , however			0
as a teenager in @entity343 , she worked at nearby @entity344 as a parking lot attendant – and even did a stint in the theme park as a costumed character in parades			0
@entity8 was still listed on the @entity1 's website as the agency 's director as of 3:45 p.m. wednesday .			1

*september* 19 fence - jumper got deep inside the @entity7 despite heavy security surrounding the building , and entered through an *unlocked* door
days earlier , an armed man rode in an elevator with @entity35 – and his @entity1 detail was n't aware he was packing
@entity7 learned of elevator incident ' just minutes ' before media reports blasted it to the public
@entity8 is a 30 - year veteran of the @entity1 ; she said resigning with her agency in tatters was ' the noble thing to do '
' the media has made it clear that this is what they expected '
the @entity7 had steadfastly expressed confidence in her but accepted her resignation as calls for her ouster mounted on @entity49
@entity312 , a retired agent , will return to the @entity1 as interim director until the president picks a permanent successor
