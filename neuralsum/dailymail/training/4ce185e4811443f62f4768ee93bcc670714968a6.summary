by @entity1 reporter published : 16:35 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 16:40 est , 12 may 2013 be wary : @entity2 suffers from rickets due to a vitamin d deficiency and mother @entity5 thinks it was caused by high - factor sunscreen @entity8 ’s mother @entity5 believed she was doing her best for her sports - mad young son by smothering him in factor 50 sunscreen every time he went out to play			1
but it meant that the football and cricket - loving youngster had very little exposure to direct sunlight – our main source of vitamin d – despite spending most of his days in the garden			1
now mrs @entity23 has been told her six - year - old son has got rickets , the bone - softening disease caused by a lack of vitamin d , with the high factor sun cream thought to be to blame			1
the disease , a scourge of @entity32 , was virtually eradicated after the @entity33 but is returning in children due partly to lack of outdoor play and to diets low in oily fish , eggs , liver and other foods rich in vitamin @entity42 however some experts also blame the over-zealous application of sun cream by parents anxious about skin cancer			1
vitamin d – known as the sunshine vitamin – is made when the body is exposed to sunlight			1
@entity2 first developed joint pain when he was three and would wake up during the night screaming in pain			1
‘ it would take me hours to settle him and i was constantly having to give him @entity57 and ibuprofen , ’ said mrs @entity23 , 43 , of @entity54 , @entity55			0
‘ i would be back and forth to the doctors every couple of months for about two years trying to get a diagnosis , but i was always told that it was probably growing pains			0
’ it was only when @entity2 started school that he was referred to a paediatrician who diagnosed serious vitamin d deficiency and rickets			1
mrs @entity23 , a mother of two who had to give up her work as a teacher due to ill health , said : ‘ i was really shocked when we got the diagnosis			0
@entity2 has a balanced diet and plays outside all the time			0
‘ the doctor told us that the sun was the main source of vitamin d but that using a higher factor sunscreen could stop your body from generating it			1
@entity84 is back : mother @entity5 always thought she was doing right by protecting her son @entity2 from the sun ‘ after we got home i did some research about rickets and found that @entity2 had every symptom			2
since then i ’ve met other mums with children suffering from a similar thing			2
' you ’re told that the sun is dangerous and you think that by buying the highest factor sunscreen you ’re protecting your family , when that is n’t necessarily the case			0
‘ now i tend to leave the sunscreen unless @entity2 is going to be in strong sun all day			0
‘ i make sure that he goes outside for short bursts of time early in the day or in the evening so he gets his vitamin d without burning			2
’ @entity2 is being treated with vitamin d drops and it is hoped that this will eventually remove all symptoms of rickets			1
but he is still experiencing pain in his bones , so his mother fears that some of the damage may be permanent			2
leading paediatric surgeon professor @entity114 said : ‘ practically the only available source of vitamin d is from sunshine			1
‘ most children do n’t like oily fish and that is practically the only food which contains high levels of it			0
if you ’re protecting against the sun by using a factor 50 sunscreen you will not generate any vitamin @entity42 ‘ there is a growing problem because children are outside much less than they used to be			2
they are texting each other instead of playing outside and parents often drive them to and from school			0
they are outdoors less than ever before			0
‘ this can have important consequences for adult life and we are now linking vitamin d deficiency to multiple sclerosis			0
’ playing out : six - year - old @entity2 now has to make sure his @entity42 levels are maintained , which means taking in some of the sun when he can			0

@entity8 had very little exposure to sunlight when playing out
but this led to him missing out on a vital source of vitamin d
he wakes up at night in pain , suffering from the bone softening disease rickets
