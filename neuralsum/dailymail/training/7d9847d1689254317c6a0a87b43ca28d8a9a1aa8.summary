' @entity0 ? ' calls out a man in pink shorts			2
he looks as if he could be one of those languidly dapper overly confident types with whom @entity4 spent so much time at @entity7			2
i do n’t mind if i do - but , sadly , his generous offer is limited to his chums seated around a long outdoor table , where they all glow in the flattering evening light			1
old - fashioned @entity16 appeal : the @entity18 charms with its leather armchairs and open fires it is the most beautiful of sunsets , and i can think of few better places to enjoy it than at the @entity18 , a former lodge on the edge of the 1,000 - acre @entity28 deer park			1
@entity29 at its best , with a few dollops of irreverence thrown in , courtesy , mainly , of some saucy @entity34 artwork in the bar			1
simple yet sophisticated : rooms boast lovely touches such as stand - alone bathtubs this is a class act combining the skills and interests of art dealer @entity42 ( the owner ) , designer @entity45 ( interior design ) , @entity47 ( architecture ) and @entity49 ( food )			1
ours is small but pretty , tasteful and elegant			0
no tv and nothing as rudimentary as ' tea and coffee making facilities			0
' even the bed valance is made of woven fabric			0
everything looks expensive , but in a understated sort of way			0
the main bar is all fun and games : pool table , telly on the wall , real ales , black and white photos of @entity71 and @entity72			1
this is in marked contrast to a couple of residents - only parlours , where the vibe is studious , restrained			2
country pursuits : deer roam in the grounds of the @entity18 - which sits prettily in a leafy @entity29 setting the @entity83 could wander into the @entity18 and no one would be fazed			1
come to think of it , the @entity85 and @entity83 of @entity87 ’s new @entity29 pad is not too far away - but this is more of a @entity89 ( will she ever come back ? let ’s hope so ) place than a @entity92			1
we sit at a long sharing table for dinner , next to a window looking out to the park - where a teepee stands in the distance			1
on the nibbles list is pork crackling , and it ’s the best you will ever find			0
the fire in the main dining room is blazing in the morning , even though the temperature outside is in the 20s			0
there ’s something not quite right about the coffee ; my soft boiled eggs are hard and i ’m not sure about make - your - own toast			2
but the @entity18 is still a bohemian rhapsody that sets the standard for all other inns with rooms			0
the @entity118 from £ 95 , @entity119 rating :			0
