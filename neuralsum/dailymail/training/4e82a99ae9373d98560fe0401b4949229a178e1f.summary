by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 23 april 2013 @entity1 leaving @entity2 today , as it emerges @entity3 would walk free from prison next month @entity5 and his former wife @entity6 are due to walk free from jail within weeks after serving only two months of their eight - month sentences			1
the news emerged yesterday as @entity5 offered to pay less than a quarter of the £ 108,000 that prosecutors want him to cough up towards the costs of bringing him to justice			1
they told a court the costs were so high because the multi-millionaire former cabinet minister chose to run a dishonest defence			0
but @entity5 , 58 , claims he should not have to meet the full taxpayer - funded bill and his barrister said he is willing to pay only £ 25,000			1
he and 60 - year - old @entity6 were jailed on march 11 for perverting the course of justice after she took speeding points for him in 2003 so that he could avoid a driving ban			1
this was seven years before their marriage collapsed over his affair with @entity1			0
sources close to the former @entity32 mp expect him to be released on may 13 , but they added that his freedom could be delayed because of an administrative backlog of prisoners waiting to be released			2
@entity6 is likely to be freed on the same day – after they have served only a quarter of their sentences			0
they will probably be forced to wear an electronic tag and obey a night - time curfew on their release under a scheme for non-violent prisoners			1
for sentences of less than a year , offenders are automatically released after serving half their sentence			1
in addition , offenders serving sentences of between three months and four years , with exceptions for violent and sexual offenders , may also be eligible for release on a home detention curfew			2
this allows offenders to be freed up to 135 days before their automatic release date			0
@entity5 returned yesterday to @entity2 , where he was jailed , to fight an attempt by the @entity58 to get him to pay £ 108,539 towards the cost of bringing him to justice			1
wearing an unironed shirt and looking gaunt with unkempt hair , he listened intently during the three - hour hearing			0
@entity5 was watched closely by @entity64 and his father , @entity65			2
he was brought by van from @entity68 open prison in @entity69			0
@entity5 sensationally pleaded guilty on the morning of what would have been their joint trial for perverting the course of justice			2
@entity6 , an economics professor , was convicted after a retrial because the original jury could not reach a verdict			0
she is in @entity79 open prison in @entity80			0
the costs bill is high because more than a dozen legal hearings were held before the trial as @entity5 tried to get the case thrown out			1
it includes the £ 31,000 cost of a laborious and time - consuming police inquiry he instigated with false claims of corruption among investigators			1
disgraced : @entity5 , pictured in february , before he was sent to jail , has been hit with a claim for more than £ 100,000 costs over his attempts to get his speeding points case thrown out of court @entity97 hath no fury ... @entity5 's ex-wife @entity6 , left , faces a claim for nearly £ 50,000 over the case			1
the former cabinet minister 's love @entity1 , right , was in court to support him today prosecutor @entity104 , @entity105 , attacked @entity5 for failing to pay and said the scale of the costs was entirely his fault			1
he said the ex-politician wanted to run a dishonest defence alleging that @entity6 ’s claim that he made her take his speeding points was a ‘ lie ’			1
mr @entity104 said : ‘ but it was not a lie , it was true and mr @entity5 always knew that			2
we do submit , as to costs , that that is serious misconduct			0
’ the court heard the last - minute inquiry by @entity123 was undertaken at @entity5 ’s ‘ strident insistence ’ amid claims he could not receive a fair trial otherwise			1
it included the fruitless trawl of every single phone call made out of a police station over several weeks			0
mr @entity104 said : ‘ all of this occurred because mr @entity5 decided to do everything he could to try and get away with what he had done			2
‘ he gave in only at the last minute when defeat was inevitable			0
that is why this bill has been incurred			0
’ @entity5 ’s barrister , @entity137 , @entity105 , who commands up to £ 20,000 a day , accused the authorities of ‘ rewriting history ’			2
he claimed his client ’s actions had in fact helped police get to the bottom of the case			0
mr @entity146 said @entity5 is prepared to pay a ‘ reasonable , indeed arguably generous figure ’ of £ 25,000			1
mr @entity149 will publish his ruling on costs next week .			0
