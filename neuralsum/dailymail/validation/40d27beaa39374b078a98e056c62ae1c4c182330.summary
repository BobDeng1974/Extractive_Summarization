the @entity0 , chaired by @entity1 , said the @entity2 has ' proved its value ' @entity5 mps reacted angrily last night after a supposedly impartial £ 19million - a - year taxpayer - funded quango tore into the party ’s plans to reform human rights law			1
despite there being under two months to the election , the @entity0 piled into the political debate over the future of @entity15 ’s @entity2			1
in a statement posted on the commission ’s website , backed by a letter to mps , it claimed that changes ‘ to human rights laws that would water down the protections we all enjoy , would be “ regressive ” and undermine @entity25 ’s reputation as a global leader that can challenge human rights abuses abroad ’			1
the quango also declared the @entity2 a success , saying it had ‘ consistently proved its value ’			1
this is despite the way it has been repeatedly used by foreign criminals and terrorists to avoid deportation			1
the @entity36 have a manifesto commitment to scrap the @entity2 and replace it with a @entity39 @entity38			1
justice secretary @entity40 also plans to give @entity25 ’s @entity41 the final say over human rights cases – not the @entity44 in @entity45			2
but senior @entity5 figures view the commission ’s intervention as a nakedly political act			2
as a quango , in receipt of £ 18.7million of public money last year , it is supposed to remain outside the political fray			2
government sources said it had not even got its facts right			0
in the letter to mps , it said : ‘ @entity39 courts do not have to follow the judgements of the @entity45 court			0
our courts only need to take account of such judgements ’			0
but a senior government source said : ‘ for a start , it is plain wrong to claim that our courts are not bound by decisions made by @entity44 in @entity45			0
‘ this taxpayer - funded quango of @entity15 ’s creation is deliberately trying to play politics on the eve of an election			1
’ @entity5 mp @entity79 , part of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ this is grossly improper so close to an election from a quango which receives millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money			2
@entity5 @entity60 blasted the online statement , calling it a nakedly political act , which had got its facts wrong			0
the post said @entity39 courts were not bound by the @entity44 ( pictured ) , when in fact they are ' this country was protecting human rights when many members of the @entity94 were under dictatorships and well before @entity15 ’s @entity2 , which has only served to create extra tiers of bureaucracy , legal costs , delays and an imbalance of justice			1
’ fellow @entity5 mp @entity102 said : ‘ the commission ’s intervention shows just how politicised this self - serving quango has become			2
‘ their blanket opposition to any re-balancing of our skewed human rights law ignores the concerns expressed by countless senior @entity39 judges , and displays an arrogant contempt for the basic principle of democratic accountability we ’ve lost in this area			0
’ the commission was established by @entity15 in 2006 ‘ to protect and promote equality and human rights in @entity25 ’			0
in 2011 , home secretary @entity121 decided to scale back its powers drastically after a report found the commission had ‘ struggled ’ to do its job , while providing low - quality work and poor value for money			0
@entity0 chief executive @entity130 said : ‘ we are at a crossroads for human rights			1
one path risks undermining and diminishing our influence and status as a global leader in human rights and civil liberties			0
‘ the other will safeguard our reputation for fairness and moral authority when confronting human rights abuses abroad			0
