when @entity1 began losing his hearing at 20 , he decided he would use his new reliance on technology to hear something others could n't : the sound of @entity8			1
the @entity10 - based writer teamed up with sound designer @entity11 to build a tool that translates @entity8 networks into sounds that could be picked up through his hearing aids			1
now , mr @entity1 has created a map and audio file that reveal what the internet sounds like , during his walk around @entity23 @entity22 in central @entity10			1
scroll down for audio the sound of each network is heard originating from the router 's geographical location , producing clicks whose frequency rises with the signal strength — akin to a layered series of @entity34 counters			1
pictured is how the internet sounds at the @entity23 in @entity10 , close to @entity37 in a feature for the @entity39 , mr @entity1 describes the sounds he hears from public internet data using his new hacked hearing aid			1
' as i approach turnpike lane tube station and descend to the underground platform , i catch the now familiar gurgle of the public @entity8 hub , as well as the staff network beside it , ' he writes			2
' on board the train , these sounds fade into silence as we burrow into the tunnels leading to central @entity10			1
' ' you expect it to be really strange , but it very quickly becomes ordinary , ' @entity1 ( pictured ) said the project , dubbed @entity59 , works by translating the language of a wireless network into sounds			1
each @entity8 element – such as router names , data rates and encryption modes - are assigned their own tones , which are sent to a phone and picked up using his hearing aids			1
the foreground and background layer of sound are built up through the strength of the signal , direction , name and security level on these networks			2
for instance , distant signals sound like click and pops , while stronger networks play a looped song			0
' you expect it to be really strange , but it very quickly becomes ordinary , ' mr @entity1 told @entity89			2
' it was a big blow to find i was losing my hearing , so it was nice to have my expectations turned around , to think instead of it being a disability it could be an enhancement			0
' an @entity98 artist has created stunning colourful representations showing what @entity8 waves , peaks and pulses would look like if we could see them			2
@entity106 worked with former @entity108 astrobiologist @entity107 to learn how the networks move and based the designs on coverage data taken from around the @entity112 and @entity113 in @entity114			0
the images show the shape of the @entity8 signal 's and different colours were used to distinguish the different sub channels			1
as well as looking great , the illustrations were also designed to teach people about how @entity8 signals work			0
mr @entity106 , from website @entity124 , said : ' although we use it often , we rarely think about how it works			0
' a lot of us take technology for granted and use it without appreciating the science that makes it work			0
' the project was a follow - up to @entity106 's @entity8 visualisations released last year which depicted the shape of the @entity8 signals			1
the @entity8 pulses are shown here as spheres			0
@entity106 used red , orange , yellow and other colours to represent these invisible channels that make up the overall @entity8 signal mr @entity1 said that despite wireless communication becoming a ubiquitous presence in modern life , the underlying infrastructure has remained largely invisible			1
' if you have ever wandered in circles to find a signal for your cell phone , you will know what i mean , ' he said			0
@entity59 , he said , opens the door to this world to a small degree by tuning into these fields			0
' if i have to spend my life listening to an interpretative version of the world , what elements could i add ? , ' mr @entity1 asked			0
' the data that surrounds me seems a good place to start			0
' @entity8 routers on buildings and lamp posts create a circular omnidirectional data fields around them , pictured			0
@entity8 broadcasts at a frequency between radio and microwaves , meaning that the waves or pulses are about six inches apart , as shown by these coloured bands in front of @entity112			2

@entity1 , a *journalist* in @entity10 , began losing his hearing at 20
in an art project , he created a tool that allowed him to hear @entity8 sounds
sound of each network is heard originating from the router 's location
it produces clicks whose frequency rises with the signal strength
he has created a map that shows what the internet sounds like in central @entity10 , on a route around @entity23 @entity22
