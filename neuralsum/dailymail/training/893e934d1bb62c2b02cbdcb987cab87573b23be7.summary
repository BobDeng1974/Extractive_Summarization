by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:19 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 29 may 2013 an international appeal has been issued to companies who can save the houses of @entity6 from collapse			1
bids are being invited from specialist heritage firms to draw up plans for the £ 1billion restoration of the @entity12			1
the historic building on the banks of the @entity15 is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous landmarks in the world			2
restoration : a bidding process has been launched for firms to take on the job of rescuing the houses of @entity6 specialist companies are now being sought to find a way to carry out extensive work to repair the building , without distributing the process of @entity28 politics			1
however , mps and peers could be told to pack their bags and leave the site for up to two years , instead holding debates and votes in a temporary @entity6 elsewhere			1
@entity6 officials have launched a bidding process for the restoration and renewal of the @entity12			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the successful bidder will be tasked with examining the costs , benefits , risks and general feasibility of three possible approaches to the restoration and renewal of the @entity12			2
’ one option is for ' make do and mend ' repairs to be carried out over an ‘ indefinite period ’ while a second option is for ‘ a defined , rolling programme of more substantial interventions ’ which would take place with mps and peers still around			1
here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the @entity12 to prevent a ‘ looming crisis ’ : asbestosthe walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the @entity12 at risk			1
@entity64 of the building needs re-wiring , and generators do not produce enough power ventillationmany original shafts are filled with wires , and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable			2
@entity76 boilers date from the 1930s , pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the @entity83 chamber for months @entity85 guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding , and the @entity89 belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration			1
walls are damp and stained			2
@entity93 problem throughout the @entity12 , particularly as cast - iron roofs are coming to the end of their life			0
@entity99 pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth - century roof of @entity102 every year , while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the @entity105 chamber drainage pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected			0
@entity109 of date alarms and automatic detection systems ; little ‘ compartmentation ’ meaning fire can spread easily			0
liftsoldest lift dates from 1893 , several contain obsolete components			0
only nine compliant with building regulations			0
subsidencealthough the report did not consider this , another problem is that the @entity12 is sinking into the @entity15 , with @entity89 already leaning 18 inches			0
but it is thought the most likely option is to schedule the works ‘ over a more concentrated period with parliamentary activities moved elsewhere and unfettered access to the @entity12 for the delivery of the works ’			0
the tender was published in the @entity128 of the @entity129 yesterday			0
bids are due to be submitted by june 14			0
last year @entity131 suggested moving the @entity83 to @entity132 or the @entity133 in @entity134			0
however it had been thought that if mps did vacate the famous green benches it would be to a site nearby , possibly in the shadow of the @entity89 clock tower or across the road the @entity144 conference centre			1
the bidding process sets out the ‘ essential requirement that @entity6 must be able to continue its work uninterrupted at all times ’			1
@entity131 have already rejected the nuclear option of moving out of the @entity12 altogether , turning it into a museum and building an entirely new parliament building somewhere else in @entity134			0
a report commissioned by @entity6 last year found the @entity154 structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing			1
it warned that @entity131 and @entity105 will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics , heating , ventilation systems , drainage and stone work			1
they concluded that the @entity168 - which contains the @entity83 and lords chambers as well as suites of committee rooms , offices and dining rooms - was so poorly - maintained that it is ‘ remarkable that it continues to function ’			0
and they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe , the @entity12 could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834			1
although they do not put a final cost on the work , they say it will be at least £ 1.6billion			1
the damning report on the state of the home of @entity28 democracy was ordered by the @entity190			2
published in november , it warned : ‘ while the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown , investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the @entity12			1
’ there has been no renovation to the spectacular building , rebuilt along designs by @entity202 in the 1850s , since the late 1940s , following the destruction of the @entity83 chamber by @entity207 bombs			0
the report goes on : ‘ considering the age of the @entity12 , the 60 - plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment , the long - term under - investment in the fabric and the intensive use to which the @entity12 is put , it is remarkable that it continues to function			2
‘ the signs of wear and tear , the number and frequency of relatively minor floods and mechanical breakdowns , the high cost of maintaining obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible evidence of the looming crisis			0
' packing up : the @entity83 and the @entity105 are expected to be vacated for two years while the major works are carried out ‘ a growing body of surveys , consultancy reports and risk registers point to the further deterioration that will occur and the severe hazards that could occur if fundamental renovation is delayed indefinitely			2
‘ it is hard to imagine how the @entity12 will survive for future generations to use and admire without a major mid-life overhaul			0
’ among the many problems facing the building are antiquated electrics , clapped - out boilers and leaking roofs			2
@entity246 , which is ‘ present throughout the building ’ , is identified as a ‘ risk to all persons within the @entity12 ’ .			0

bidding process launched to assess scale of *challenge*
firms warned @entity6 must continue its work ' uninterrupted at all times '
but mps and peers could move to a temporary new home for two years
