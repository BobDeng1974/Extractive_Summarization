@entity6 , 20 , who was lured to a house and raped by an @entity9 gang when she was 12 , set up fake profiles to ensnare middle - aged men using a teenage chatroom to prey on young girls			0
by using digital technology to alter the sound of their voices , she and her boyfriend – dubbed a ‘ paedophile hunter ’ by police – convinced the men that they were talking to schoolgirls before handing the evidence to detectives			0
yesterday @entity26 , 47 , a team leader at a rail infrastructure firm , was jailed for 21 months by a judge who branded him ‘ a parent ’s worst nightmare ’			1
he had messaged one of the duo ’s alter egos saying he wanted to ‘ do stuff ’ to her , while a second man caught by @entity37 asked one of the ‘ girls ’ to perform a sex act			2
@entity41 , pictured left , received a suspended sentence , while @entity26 , pictured right , was jailed for 21 months			1
the two both admitted to attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity judge @entity47 said the case highlighted how the internet made youngsters vulnerable to grooming , saying : ‘ it is obviously a worry for parents whose children are using these teenage chatrooms as to who is getting in touch with them			1
’ but following the rise of vigilante groups such as @entity59 , detectives last night warned people worried about child abuse not to take the law into their own hands			2
miss @entity6 had been walking home in @entity65 in 2007 when @entity66 lured her into his car before taking her to a house where she was plied with alcohol and repeatedly raped by the 39 - year - old and three other men			0
@entity66 was jailed for six years , and miss @entity6 later waived her right to anonymity to campaign for tougher sentences for paedophiles			2
last year she and boyfriend @entity76 , 24 , began examining @entity78 - based chatroom teen - chat.org , which is aimed at 13 to 19 - year - olds , over fears that paedophiles were using it to groom potential victims			2
they set up fake profiles including ‘ @entity85 ’ and ‘ @entity86 ’ , and in april last year @entity76 contacted @entity87 asking for a private conversation			0
he claimed to be 18 and made sexually explicit suggestions to the girl			0
despite the pair ’s ‘ coy ’ and ‘ non-committal ’ responses , he asked to meet up so they could ‘ do stuff ’ , including ‘ maybe a f * * * if you want to ’ , @entity95 , prosecuting , told @entity98 , @entity99			0
the pair were sentenced at @entity98 , @entity99 , today speaking via their computer ’s microphone but using a synthesiser so mr @entity76 ’s voice sounded like a girl ’s , they gave @entity26 a phone number and he called to ask ‘ whether she was on her own ’ and what time her parents would be home			1
at that point , miss @entity6 told @entity26 that the conversation was being recorded and the pair ’s evidence was handed to police			1
@entity117 dressed in a grey suit and holding his head in his hands , @entity26 , from @entity121 , was jailed for 21 months after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange or facilitate the commission of a child sex offence and attempting to engage a child in sexual activity			1

he was also made the subject of a prevention order			0
earlier this year @entity139 , 66 , of @entity140 , @entity141 , was given a three - year community order for offences arising out of their pair ’s sting			0
after yesterday ’s hearing , miss @entity6 said : ‘ i ’m happy about the first sentence but appalled at the second one , i think it is ridiculous			0
