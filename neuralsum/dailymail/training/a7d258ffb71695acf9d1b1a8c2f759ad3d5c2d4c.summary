opponent : doctor @entity1 , the chairman of the @entity3 's gp committee and a family gp in north - west @entity5 @entity6 are to hold a vote on charging for appointments			1
the idea is to deter patients from missing consultations – a problem that costs £ 160million a year			1
the fees – possibly between £ 10 and £ 25 – would be the first since the @entity15 was founded in 1948			1
one gp said an entire morning 's work was lost when 14 patients failed to turn up			1
others believe the free care offered by the @entity21 is unsustainable in the face of an aging and increasingly obese population			0
it is feared however that charging would stop patients seeking help or encourage them to go to overstretched casualty units			1
the proposal is to be debated at the @entity3 's local medical committee conference in @entity32 on may 22			2
if the vote is passed , the @entity3 would then have to decide whether to ask the @entity34 to impose a national charging system			2
it is likely that the elderly , children , pregnant women and others will be exempt or charged less			0
patients could be charged when they book an appointment – an incentive to turn up			1
the gp practice would pocket the money – as happens with charges for writing letters or signing forms – to be reinvested into services			2
in @entity51 patients pay a flat rate of 23 euros ( £ 19 ) to see a gp and most are reimbursed by insurers , leaving them with a bill of about six euros ( £ 5 )			1
but campaigners and many family doctors – including the leaders of the @entity3 – oppose the idea in @entity60			0
dr @entity61 , who chairs the @entity62 , said : ' a move to charge for routine appointments will have a devastating impact on many vulnerable patients			1
' this will put pressure on already stretched @entity70 services as people would be reluctant to pay to visit their gp and will present themselves at the emergency services			2
' there are many people today who can not afford to pay for every gp appointment			0
' this practice can be seen as nothing less than profiteering from the most vulnerable as they attempt to access healthcare which is theirs by right			0
' but there are fears that charging would stop patients seeking help or encourage them to go to overstretched casualty units @entity1 , chairman of the @entity3 's gp committee and a family doctor in @entity5 , said : ' the @entity3 policy still is that we do not support charging patients because it is against the @entity15 's care being provided at the point of delivery			1
anyone who is ill should not have to consider cost as a barrier to seeing their gp			2
' but @entity102 , of the @entity104 campaign group , said : ' missed and unnecessary gp appointments cost taxpayers a fortune so it 's no wonder that charges are being considered			1
' but until @entity6 drastically improve the service they provide by working out of office hours and reintroducing more responsive appointments , they should not be asking hard - pressed families to cough up even more cash for a substandard system			0
' primary care must be run for patients , not for doctors			0
' dr @entity119 , chief executive of the @entity121 local medical committee , which is proposing the motion , said : ' personally i feel that services should be free at the point of access			0
' the problem we have at the moment is that the resources that are available do n't meet the demand			0
this is about having a debate about how we move things forward			0
' general practice is still seen around the world as one of the strengths of the @entity15			2
to continue this and to build on out - of - hospital care we need more resources			0
' if that ca n't be obtained by taxation it 's going to have to come either from closing hospitals down – which is incredibly difficult – or resources need to come from elsewhere			0
' many of us would n't want it to come from charging patients but that 's why we need a debate			1
' the motion – uncovered by @entity155 – calls on the @entity3 to ' explore national charging for general practice services with the @entity60 governments '			0
gps will also vote on whether to defy the government 's plans for them to keep surgeries open from 8am to 8pm to make it easier for patients to get appointments .			1

the fee would be the first since the @entity15 was founded in 1948
missed appointments cost the @entity15 £ 160million a year
