@entity0 moved top of the @entity2 after goalkickers @entity3 and @entity5 combined to punish @entity7 's poor discipline at @entity8			1
fly - half @entity3 landed four penalties and a conversion of flanker @entity13 's first - half try , while @entity5 capped an impressive individual performance by booting two long - range strikes as @entity0 triumphed 25 - 22 to make it two wins out of three this term and climb one point above unbeaten trio @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity7 dominated early on through tries from wing @entity25 and prop @entity27 , but they handed @entity3 and @entity5 regular opportunities to punish them , which they gratefully accepted			1
@entity5 of @entity0 breaks the tackle of @entity7 centre @entity30 @entity13 celebrates after crossing for the first @entity0 try at @entity8 @entity0 's @entity3 lines up a conversion during the @entity2 match at @entity8 the cherry and whites have so far leaked an average of 35 points and four tries per game during new rugby director @entity41 ' reign , and although it is early days for a new - look squad , a losing bonus point secured by flanker @entity46 's touchdown will provide scant consolation			1
half - backs @entity48 and @entity49 each added a conversion , while @entity49 slotted a late penalty , yet @entity0 kept their composure as the clock ticked down , following up a landslide opening weekend win at @entity56 with another away victory			0
@entity7 huffed and puffed during the stamina - sapping closing stages in an attempt to salvage the contest , but @entity0 confirmed their reputation as a solid @entity2 outfit through a thoroughly - professional performance			2
@entity7 showed four changes from the side that accounted for @entity67 six days ago , with centre @entity68 making his @entity2 debut instead of an injured @entity71 , while prop @entity72 replaced @entity73 , lock @entity74 took over from @entity75 and @entity76 packed down in the back - row			0
@entity0 boss @entity77 , meanwhile , handed starts to prop @entity79 and lock @entity80 as the solitary starting xv changes following a narrow home defeat against @entity23 last time out			0
the @entity84 won last season 's corresponding fixture 29 - 12 , with @entity3 kicking 19 points , and it took him just three minutes to open his account this time around , landing an angled penalty after @entity7 infringed inside their own half			1
@entity84 ' @entity80 is tackled by @entity7 's @entity92 and @entity93 @entity7 and @entity94 hooker @entity93 makes a break during the friday night match but @entity7 hit back quickly after @entity0 wing @entity97 was sin - binned for a mid-air challenge on opposite number @entity100 , with may proving the home side 's attacking magician			2
put into space just inside his own half , he won a thrilling race to ground his own kick , getting to the touchdown inches before may 's opposite number @entity109 , who made a valiant attempt to thwart the danger			0
and @entity0 were in trouble again shortly afterwards , failing to regroup quickly enough after scrum - half @entity114 went off injured as @entity7 's forwards drove relentlessly from a lineout before @entity27 claimed a try that @entity48 converted			2
a second @entity3 penalty narrowed the gap to 12 - 6 after 15 minutes before @entity97 returned , before two further @entity3 strikes in six minutes tied things up as he made it 14 successful kicks from 14 attempts this term			0
that 100 per cent record then ended , though , when he drifted a long - range penalty attempt just short as @entity7 continued to encounter scrummaging problems , with @entity27 under particular pressure			0
@entity5 attempts to tackle @entity130 of @entity7 as the hosts attempt a comeback @entity7 full back @entity133 is tackled by @entity136 wing @entity135 @entity7 's early zip and promise had evaporated , and @entity0 did not require a second invitation to establish a commanding advantage by half - time			1
superb approach work by back - row forwards @entity144 and @entity145 set up a close - range score for @entity13 that @entity3 converted as @entity0 went in front for the first time , then a @entity5 penalty made it 22 - 12 at the break as @entity7 trooped off with plenty to contemplate			1
and it almost got even worse for the home side after @entity5 scythed through @entity7 's midfield defence before replacement scrum - half @entity157 kicked on and touched down , but referee @entity158 ruled a forward pass by @entity5 after consulting with television match official @entity160			1
@entity7 then had substitute @entity161 harshly yellow - carded for what @entity162 ruled was a dangerous tackle on the charging @entity165 , and @entity5 hit the target from just inside @entity7 's half to open up a 13 - point @entity0 lead			2
@entity0 preserved that lead until into the final quarter , but @entity171 's 63rd - minute touchdown , converted by @entity49 , set up a gripping finale as @entity7 moved to within striking distance			0
@entity49 's 72nd - minute penalty gave @entity0 further cause for concern as pressure began to mount , but they had done just enough to frustrate their opponents and reach the early - season @entity2 summit			0
@entity7 forward @entity161 is yellow carded by referee @entity181			0
