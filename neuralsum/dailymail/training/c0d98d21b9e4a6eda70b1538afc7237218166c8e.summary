it is globally recognised as the safe option for any weary traveler who fears the local cuisine may unravel their sensitive stomach			0
but it transpires that @entity8 's restaurants are not all as similar as once thought			2
the cosmic outlet in @entity10 , @entity11 - appropriately designed to look like a spaceship - is world 's apart from the one in @entity14 that sells local delicacies from a restaurant embossed in @entity19 posters			2

it would be difficult to bring in 68 million daily customers in 119 countries , across 35,000 outlets and an annual revenue stream of over Â£ 18billion without considering cultural differences - and stereotypes			1
so you can ski up to a warm looking lodge for your mcnuggets in @entity38 , @entity39 or enjoy a lakeside view under the mystic hills of @entity42 in @entity43			0
and the @entity48 croquettes in @entity49 , spicy paneer wraps in @entity14 and a pulled pork burger in @entity46 that takes four hours to prepare could be proof that not all @entity8 's are made equal			1
