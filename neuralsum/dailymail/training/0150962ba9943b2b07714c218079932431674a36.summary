by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 10:40 est , 9 may 2012 at @entity3 station , a woman casually climbs onto the track of an oncoming train			2
she trips over but seems more worried about her handbag than the hulking mass of metal approaching her			0
luckily for her , she makes it to the other side without getting hit			0
@entity12 footage from the same station shows a man in his twenties , probably drunk			0
he too dices with death by climbing down onto the track and blindly stumbling to the other side , where he is hauled to safety			2
but they , and others like them , would do well to know that nearly 50 people have been killed after taking shortcuts and trespassing across railway lines in the last year , according to @entity27			1
scroll down for the cctv a woman at @entity3 station trips over while trying to take a shortcut - as a train approaches she seems more concerned about her handbag than the possible doom she faces fortunately for her , she escaped unharmed - but there have been nearly 50 fatalities over the past year from people trespassing on tracks out of the 49 accidental deaths on railway lines between april 1 last year and march 31 , 88 per cent were male with more than a third aged between 16 and 25			1
and to illustrate the point , @entity27 has posted pictures of various people with a deathwish - such as a male jogger , in red top and black shorts , seen running alongside a track in @entity48 , @entity49			1
just one stumble onto a live rail and he probably would n't be doing any running ( or anything else ) again			0
@entity27 has also teamed up with 400m hurdles champion @entity55 to warn people about the dangers of taking a shortcut across the tracks			1
a jogger dices with death as he runs alongside a track in @entity48 , @entity49 a man , possibly drunk , lowers himself onto the rail tracks at @entity3 station last june he then risks his life by running to the other platform , stumbling on his way lucky to make it to the other side without getting hit , he is dragged to safety by a fellow traveller a @entity27 grab shows a woman who has fallen over while crossing tracks in @entity3 @entity55 appears in an online video as part of a campaign called @entity80 which is being launched today			1
in it , he is shown struggling to run along tracks due to rain , grease on the line and other hazards , which aims to show that if a fit , agile athlete is unable to get out of the way of a train , then others will not have a chance			0
@entity80 will also feature a @entity93 page and mobile and online advertising campaign over the next four weeks			1
@entity96 , who won gold at the @entity98 last summer , said : ' day in day out , i train hard to make sure i am as quick as i can be			0
' on the running track , it ’s important that my reactions are lightning fast but on the train track - during filming - that did n’t count for much			0
' the experience has brought to life just how many dangers there are on the rail tracks - most of which i knew nothing about			0
' i hope that this film really helps @entity27 to show people that taking the risk is never worth it			1
' @entity115 , @entity27 director of operational services , said : ' we know a lot of young men think that taking a shortcut is n’t really a risk , that they can get out of the way of any train but the fatality figures show they are wrong			1
' @entity55 is one of the most fit and agile athletes in the world , someone that we know young men admire , particularly with the @entity129 so close			2
' his message and ours is simple - if he ca n’t survive the shortcut , you wo n’t either			0
' the @entity27 figures exclude suicides and fatalities at level crossings and are subject to alteration following coroners ’ inquests			2
it also reported 445 near - misses during the period , with reports of people crossing the tracks to the opposite platform upon realising their train was leaving from there , jumping down to retrieve phones or wallets and walking alongside the tracks as a shortcut home			0
