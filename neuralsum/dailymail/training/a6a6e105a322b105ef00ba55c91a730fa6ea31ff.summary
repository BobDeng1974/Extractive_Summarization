by @entity0 published : 04:31 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 04:31 est , 9 january 2013 train punctuality has tumbled to its lowest level for two years - and railway officials do not expect to meet their targets for arriving on time until the end of the decade			1
the admission comes despite the announcement of plans to invest £ 37.5billion into the rail network - which will require several more years of inflation - busting price hikes			0
according to data released by @entity14 , train punctuality has never consistently reached its target of 92.5 per cent , and stood at just 85.3 per cent in november / december 2012			1
just two of the 15 private rail operators hit the punctuality target in the latest period , with several - particularly those running long - distance lines - recording figures of no better than 80 per cent			0
punctuality : the blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month - by - month ; the red line shows a moving annual average ; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule the figures record a train as being late if it is more than five minutes behind schedule for a short - distance service , or 10 minutes for long - distance			1
alternative statistics measuring how often trains arrived within one minute of their scheduled time show that just 57.1 per cent of service are precisely on time - a number falling to 41.9 per cent for long - distance services			1
when @entity14 announced its development plans for 2014 - 19 , it admitted that the 92.5 per cent target would not be met until the end of that period			1
the company resisted pressure to set a more ambitious target - and warned that ' increasingly congested ' trains would make it hard to make any further progress on punctuality			2
expansion : @entity56 plans to upgrade @entity58 's train systems have been announced by @entity14 ' we want to do better than that , but we are facing up to some problems that come with success - that is , more trains and more passengers on an increasingly congested network , ' a spokesman said			1
' even the smallest delay at busy times can cause a ripple effect which disrupts passengers several hours later , hundreds of miles away			0
' despite the failure to increase the number of trains arriving on time over the past two years , @entity14 's plans for @entity58 's trains assume that fares will continue to rise by one per cent above inflation			1
its scheme for the next seven years was announced yesterday , just days after most fares went up by an average of 4.2 per cent			0
a top railway official said the plan was dependent on fares rising each year at a rate of one per cent above the @entity88 inflation rate , and added that any change to that assumption would require a larger subsidy from the taxpayer			1
the subsidy is instead scheduled to fall to no more than £ 2.9billion by 2019 , down from £ 4.5billion a decade earlier			2
tight squeeze : @entity14 hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute given the size of the national deficit and the government 's commitment to fiscal austerity , ministers are unlikely to reverse their course on reducing the subsidy			2
the @entity14 plan for 2014 - 19 will provide 170,000 extra morning commuter seats at peak times , including a 20 per cent increase on services into central @entity109			2
the firm also envisages 225million more passengers per year travelling by 2019 , and 355,000 more trains in service			0
specific projects include various electrification schemes , such as the @entity116 and @entity117 , station improvements at @entity119 and @entity120 , and reopening 31 miles of railways in @entity122 closed under the @entity123 cuts 50 years ago			0
@entity14 chief executive sir @entity124 warned that the railway network had ' entered an era of trade - offs ' and would have to compromise over the various demands made on it			0
' increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure , run trains on time and cut costs , and in many areas choices will need to be made , ' he said .			0
