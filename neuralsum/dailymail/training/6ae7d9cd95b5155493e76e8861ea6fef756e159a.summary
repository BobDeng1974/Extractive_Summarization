the @entity6 leader 's wife beamed as she made her way inside the @entity10 in @entity1 , before posing up for photographs with her husband			1
@entity13 is due to give his keynote speech to the conference tomorrow , and was pictured earlier today preparing his notes			1
mrs @entity0 , who is an ambassador to the @entity25 and a consultant for luxury firm @entity27 , had ditched the tight cord trousers she wore earlier in the conference for a knee - length black skirt , paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels			1

couple : the @entity40 pose up inside the conference venue ahead of tomorrow 's final speeches style : mrs @entity0 had ditched the tight cord trousers she wore earlier in the conference for a knee - length black skirt , paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels mr @entity13 said that , unlike @entity49 leader @entity48 , he would be using a script while making his speech , and was pictured jotting down ideas in his hotel room prior to his wife 's arrival			1
last week mr @entity48 was ridiculed after forgetting to mention the deficit during his 69 - minute address , claiming he did not want to read a script because he wanted to do politics differently			0
however , mr @entity13 said a script would help him to ' lay out my plan for @entity24 '			1
he told the @entity63 : ' i 've been leader of my party for eight years and prime minister for four and i think people have a clear idea			2
i do n't see a contradiction : if people are worried , is this country going to deliver for me ? is there a good job for my child ? ' is there a good school place and is there going to be a clean and safe environment ? are we going to be a country that keeps our promises to the poorest in the world because @entity24 means something in the world ? ' i think all those things are connected and i think a modern compassionate conservative can appeal to all of those and it actually all first together			0
' making notes : mr @entity13 said that , unlike @entity49 leader @entity48 , he would be using notes while making his speech , and was pictured jotting down ideas in his hotel room prior to his wife 's arrival announcement : mr @entity13 has promised ' many more ' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended - hours access to a gp seven days a week for every @entity103 patient in @entity104 today mr @entity13 has promised ' many more ' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended - hours access to a gp seven days a week for every @entity103 patient in @entity104			1
doctors ' leaders warned that there would need to be significant additional funds and staffing to implement the pledge , announced by the prime minister at the @entity6 conference in @entity1			2
but mr @entity13 insisted that 8am - 8pm opening , weekdays and weekends , was already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £ 50 million fund in selected surgeries			0
he announced a further £ 100 million to ensure that at least 10 million are covered in 2015 , and a further £ 400 million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next may 's election			0
the prime minister took part in a number of television and radio interviews today , in which he hailed @entity130 as a ' star player ' and revealed he has still not apologised to the @entity132 for revealing she ' purred ' down the phone when @entity134 voted against independence			2
double vision : mr @entity13 makes notes for his speech , while an interview he recorded earlier is played on tv mr @entity13 has been hoping to use a round of media appearances to get a grip on the coverage of his party conference in @entity1			1
it follows the shock defections of two mps to @entity149 , growing rows over @entity151 and the resignation of charities minister @entity153 who sent an explicit picture of himself to an undercover journalist			0
appearing on @entity159 's @entity158 last night , mr @entity13 was asked a series of questions to shed light on his own character			0
four decades since metres and litres replaced yards and pints on the curriculum , the prime minister suggested he would prefer to see a return to the old system			2
' i think i 'd still go for pounds and ounces , yes i do , ' mr @entity13 told @entity159 's @entity158 when asked which should be taught predominantly .			0
