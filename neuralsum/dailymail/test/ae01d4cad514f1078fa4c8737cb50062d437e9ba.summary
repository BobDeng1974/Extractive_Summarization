@entity0 hailed his ‘ phenomenal ’ side after @entity3 ’s scrappy goal put @entity4 on the brink of the @entity7 title			1

victory at home to @entity14 on sunday will now hand @entity4 their first league crown since 2010			1
@entity3 ( right ) flicks home from close range after a scramble in the @entity11 box following a corner @entity3 turns and celebrates after making it 2 - 1 to @entity4 with a close - range finish against @entity11 ‘ it is phenomenal what my team are doing , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ being top of the league since day one is not easy ; i think we are what every team would like to be			2
‘ @entity32 is ready to celebrate but if i can ask something from them it is to not celebrate			2
we all want to win on sunday but it will be a difficult game			2
@entity32 must be ready to push us			0
‘ the april month , where everybody expected @entity4 to drop points playing difficult matches against teams fighting not to be relegated as well as @entity42 and @entity43 , was exactly the month where we destroy opponents			1
‘ it was a month without @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , without ( @entity50 ) @entity49 , with @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and @entity53 playing striker , no other solutions , just this small group of players we have			0
we were tactically phenomenal , team spirit , team ethic , the way we defended , the way we were clinical with our goals , the stability we showed in every game			2
‘ in this moment we are 13 points ahead of second			0
we won every game except the draw against @entity42			0
the boys , when the pressure was on , were even stronger			0
‘ the old and the young			0
@entity72 , great performance , @entity3 , @entity51 , @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , but other giants on the pitch , ( @entity79 ) @entity78 , ( @entity81 ) @entity80 , @entity82			0
so i 'm so , so happy			0
i just need three more points to celebrate			0
’ @entity82 ( right ) struck his effort with such power that he had both feet off the ground at one point @entity0 watches on with muddy shoes just as his side scored against @entity11 @entity0 must feel like he is walking on water as his @entity4 side edged another step closer to the title @entity11 , on a run of four successive wins , led at the break through @entity100 ’s goal			1
but @entity52 equalised , @entity3 put @entity4 ahead , and @entity82 added a late screamer			1
‘ if i tell you what i said it will be ' peep peep peep '			0
too many peeps ! ’ laughed @entity0			1
@entity3 added : ‘ they were a tough side and they kept fighting			0
we got a telling off at half - time and we came out and played excellently in the second half			1
it was n't good enough in the first half but listen , we got the three points			2
@entity52 looks on as his effort from inside the box drifts in to the far corner past goalkeeper @entity118 ‘ we 've been the best side all season			0
we deserve a lot of respect , we 've been very good all year			0
let 's hope we win it on sunday			1
’ @entity52 said : ‘ we do n't get enough credit			0
we are top of the league , we have the most points and people find us boring because we 've been top since day one			0
’ @entity11 lost @entity131 and @entity132 to injury in the first 25 minutes and manager @entity134 rued the double loss , while praising @entity4 's champion qualities			1
‘ it was difficult tonight because we 've had to make substitutions which in normal circumstances we would n't have done - but that 's life , ’ he said			1
@entity52 ( right ) wheels away in celebration as his team - mates @entity143 and @entity145 congratulate him ‘ i do n't think our players deserved being on the end of a 3 - 1 defeat because it was a tighter game than that			2
" i 've heard criticisms of @entity4 in recent weeks and i find it very bemusing			1
the best sides are able to win games in different ways and they 've illustrated that tonight			2
‘ i think they 're a really good side and have some great players			0
i 'm not oblivious to the views that were spouted at the weekend in terms of style of football but i 'm a big believer in winning games and that 's it			2
‘ @entity4 are worthy champions			1
’ @entity52 ( centre ) was the star of the show for @entity4 - and he was leading his team - mates in celebrations			1

@entity4 edged ever closer to the title with win against @entity11
but not before @entity0 gave his squad a half - time rollicking
@entity4 fell behind in first - half injury time via @entity100 's goal
the @entity179 *reacted* well and earned the victory with three second - half goals
