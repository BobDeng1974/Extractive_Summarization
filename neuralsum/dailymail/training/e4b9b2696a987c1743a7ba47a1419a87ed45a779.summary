@entity1 's civil aviation authority is looking to introduce ' world - first ' rules surrounding the use of drones after an increase in them being flown ' inappropriately '			1
the rules currently in place were introduced in 2002 and do not reflect the changes in technology , @entity8 spokesman @entity7 told @entity13			1
drones must be kept more than 30 metres away from other people and must not be flown over public places where a large number of people are gathered such as the beach or sporting events			1
the one pictured is a quadcopter the devices - which can come with gps systems and cameras - can only be operated during the day and within line of sight			0
they should also be kept more than five kilometres away from airports and must not be flown above 400 feet			0
if these regulations as well as others are violated , infringement notices may be issued or prosecution may be sought where people have been injured			2
mr @entity7 said 12 years ago recreational use of drones simply did not exist and it was time the authority addressed this growth			2
' there are 180 commercial operators and probably tens of thousands of recreational drones out there , ' he said			2
' we need to update them and bring them up - to - date with usages			0
' @entity1 was the first country to introduce rules around drones and regulations coming in next year would be a ' world - first ' mr @entity7 said an increase in incidents involving drones had also sparked the authority to update their policies			1
' we are getting regular incidents happening where drones are being used inappropriately , ' he said			1
' near christmas there was a police operation in @entity64 and someone flew a drone which hit a power line and it almost fell on a police officer			0
we need to take [ incidents like ] that into account as well			2
' mr @entity7 was unable to comment on specific changes but he said they would be practical and enable recreational users the ability to still have fun			2
' it 's early days and we 're in the process of developing proposals and we â€™re going to do public consultation , ' he told @entity13			0
' but the key to it would be making the rules as practical as possible for your average recreational drone owner , while obviously trying to get the right safety outcomes			0
' we 're not trying to stop people flying around their drones in the park or the beach or in the paddock			1
' they are great fun to fly and relatively speedy			0
we 're trying to get right set of rules to protect aircraft in the air and those on the ground			0
' the introduction of these rules in @entity1 would set a precedent for the rest of the world			1
' the @entity103 do n't have any rules ... so we are very much ahead of the game here , ' mr @entity7 said			0
' we were the first country in the world to have rules around drones			1

the current rules for *unmanned* *aerial* *vehicles* were introduced in 2002
a @entity8 spokesman said they did not reflect changes in technology
he said new rules would strike a balance between practicality and still allow people to have fun with drones
there have been ' regular incidents ' which involved drones being used ' inappropriately ' in @entity1
