@entity1 consumers have not turned out in force for the final shopping days before @entity4 , suggesting that traditional retailers will just meet industry sales forecasts in a season marked by deep discounts and growing encroachment from online rivals led by @entity11			1
super saturday - the last pre-christmas saturday , which fell on december 20 this year - failed to make up for spotty performance this season			0
that included a disappointing @entity16 , the day after the @entity1 @entity18 holiday that is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year			2
' the past weekend will not save this holiday season , ' said @entity21 , president of the retail and consumer product - oriented private equity fund customer growth partners			1
slow but steady : despite slow sales during @entity27 and the days leading up to @entity4 , @entity1 retailers are still expected to hit a sales growth target of 3.4 percent ' but combined with online sales , it would certainly save the year from being a dismal one			1
' @entity21 said if sales hold up in the next few days and the week after @entity4 , retailers may finish close to his company 's november and december forecast of 3.4 percent growth in store and online sales			1
he estimates that @entity27 weekend sales , which include store and online , rose 2.5 percent to $ 42 billion this year			1
the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , the leading industry trade body , forecast a 4.1 percent rise in holiday sales this year , including online and store sales			1
the @entity40 is hoping to meet its expectations amid falling gasoline prices , lower @entity1 unemployment and consumer spending which showed signs of increasing during the first two weeks of december			2
promotions heated up in the past five days but that did not boost store traffic materially , said @entity53 , senior managing director of @entity54			0
most retailers offered an additional 20 to 30 percent off on top of 30 to 40 percent discounts on a wide range of products , @entity55 found during a series of visits to three dozen stores in @entity64 over the weekend			0
best - sellers during the season included @entity67 's ( @entity69 ) @entity68 6 , toys based on the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) animated movie ' @entity72 , ' and winter clothing such as coats from retailers like @entity77 ( @entity78 ) after a cold spell last month			1
home appliances including mixers , coffee makers and food processors from chains like @entity86 ( @entity87 ) , @entity88 ( @entity89 ) @entity90 ( @entity91 ) and @entity92 ( @entity93 ) were also particularly popular , industry - watchers said			0
threat : online rivals like @entity11 are each year making it easier for shoppers to not venture into stores @entity27 sales rose 0.5 percent to $ 9.15 billion from $ 9.1 billion a year ago , according to early estimates by @entity101 , which surveys spending at brick - and - mortar stores			1
this fell short of the firm 's $ 10 billion sales forecast for the day , founder @entity104 told @entity55			1
analytics firm @entity108 , which tracks specialty stores and large footprint retailers , said sales dropped 8.9 percent over the weekend versus a year ago , and store traffic dipped 10.2 percent			1
however , customers who did hit the stores spent more			0
specialty stores in the @entity1 include chains like @entity117 ( @entity118 ) and large footprint retailers include @entity120 ( @entity121 ) and @entity92			0
' even with this drop in growth , @entity27 was still better compared to @entity16 , ' said @entity124 , vice president of retail consulting at @entity108			2
' it generated a tad more in terms of sales on slightly less traffic			0
' promotions earlier in november took a toll on in - store sales during the @entity18 weekend , when total spending fell by 11 percent from a year earlier			2
highly discounted categories like consumer electronics and home improvement , which have had a strong season this year , continued to do well on @entity27			2
the apparel segment , which has had one of its worst years , also picked up momentum , although not enough to offset slower growth in the past two months			0
experts including @entity21 said the growth in apparel is occurring on the back of heavily discounted pricing , so margins this year will be weak in most of the category			0
@entity54 's @entity53 pointed to a jump in online shopping this past weekend which , he said , will bring relief to retailers with physical stores who also have an online presence			0
' the majority of retailers will be flat to negative in their bricks and mortar business but their online sales will show significant double - digit increases			2
this should boost the overall sales number .			0

slow sales during @entity27 and the days leading up to @entity4
retailers likely to ' just ' meet forecast of 3.4 percent growth
@entity27 sales still rose 0.5 percent to $ 9.15 billion
that 's from $ 9.1 billion a year ago
@entity40 ( @entity40 ) forecast a 4.1 percent rise in holiday sales
best - selling retail items were @entity68 6 , ' @entity72 ' toys and winter clothes
