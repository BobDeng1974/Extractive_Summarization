by @entity0 published : 14:25 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 16:20 est , 6 february 2013 ' pathological liar ' : a coroner said he believed @entity3 started the fire deliberately so he could rescue his partner 's daughters and emerge a hero a coroner has agreed with a police theory that a ' pathological liar ' deliberately started a fire that killed his partner 's two year old daughter so he could rescue her and be hailed a hero			1
@entity15 was eating her dinner in an adapted @entity18 minibus with her half - sister @entity19 , one , when a blaze broke out in an adjacent barn , spreading to the van and engulfing it in huge flames			1
@entity3 , 39 , the partner of @entity15 's mother @entity25 , 24 , managed to pull @entity19 from the burning van but could n't reach little @entity27 - known as @entity28 - who perished in the blaze @entity30 in september 2011			1
mr @entity3 denied he was responsible for @entity28 's death at an inquest at @entity33 today			1
but the hearing was told police suspected the 39 - year - old - who had previously lied about being an army veteran and invented a story about having a sister who had been brutally murdered - had started the fire himself so that he could rescue the little girls and be feted as a hero and ' the saviour of the day '			1
coroner @entity44 , who described mr @entity3 as a ' very sad man ' who ' wanted to be liked ' , said : ' i personally have no reason to think that the police 's theory is in any way far fetched or unjustified			1
' i think the theory is correct			0
' asked by mr @entity44 whether he denied the theory offered by police that he had deliberately started the inferno , @entity3 replied : ' it was n't me			1
' the coroner recorded a narrative verdict , and said : ' the police inquiries were such that they had a reason to be concerned about the activities and possible motive of @entity25 's then partner @entity3			1
tragic : @entity15 , two , died when the fire spread from a barn to the minibus in which she was eating dinner with her half sister @entity19 fatal : all experts who reviewed the fire agreed it was started by a naked flame applied to hay in the barn in @entity30 , the inquest heard ' it has been apparent that throughout his life that gentleman has perpetrated the most horrendous stories and lies about his previous life - that his own sister was brutally murdered			1
he invented a total false and spurious military record saying he had served in terrible spots around the world and had suffered psychological damage because of it			0
' it was entirely ficticious			0
he had n't suffered in any way			0
' it was absolute nonsense , ' the coroner said			2
' it caused the police , not unreasonably in my opinion , a concern that possibly because of this man 's flawed personality that he would want to invent stories which would turn him from what was really a very sad man into somebody else			2
he wanted to be liked			0
he wanted to be respected and he wanted to be a hero			2
' the police theory and i put it no stronger than that , that he might well , in his rather odd psyche , decide to cause a fire to occur , not because he wanted to cause harm to these little girls , but he wanted to rescue them			2
[ then ] he would be regarded as a hero , and the saviour of the day			2
' mr @entity44 said he believed the theory put forward by police to be correct			0
aftermath : mr @entity3 pulled one year old @entity19 from the flames engulfing the mini-bus , but was unable to reach @entity28 , who died in the blaze at the farm near @entity120 mr @entity3 , wearing a blue , red and white @entity122 rugby top with jeans , spoke quietly as he admitted making up a previous career in the army and lying about his non-existent sister being brutally murdered			1
mr @entity44 , who called him a ' pathological liar ' , said : ' you have told the most serious of lies			0
i do n't just mean silly tall tales			0
' you have made the most horrendous claims about losing your sister and about the military service			0
' can you think what made you say that ? ' he asked			0
to which @entity3 replied simply : ' no. ' questioned about making up his military career , @entity3 admitted that he had been in the @entity140 when he was younger but failed a medical test when he signed up			2
' mr @entity3 was a very sad ordinary man who ... wanted to ingratiate himself on people by feeding this spurious nonsense ' coroner @entity44 the coroner pointed out that he not only lied about this to ms catch and her family , but also to ambulance staff and police who attended the scene after the horrific fire			1
when pressed for a reason why , @entity3 said : ' to get people to think i was a nice guy			2
' ' you clearly want to be known as this heroic person , you think that will make people respect you , ' mr @entity156 asked him : " can you ... understand why the police have considered that you were in the vicinity at the time of the fire , you would have had the means of starting the fire as there were firelighters and @entity169 [ a flammable liquid ] in the back of your van			0
' mr @entity3 said : ' i can understand that			2
' mr @entity44 said : ' the only other person in the vicinity was [ witness and passerby ] @entity178 , she would have no reason			0
do you refute the suggestion that you started the fire so that you could rescue the two girls and be seen as a hero ? ' @entity3 replied : ' yes			1
' when mr @entity44 asked him to offer an alternative explanation for what happened , mr @entity3 said : ' i do n't know			2
' coroner @entity44 also heard from @entity188 , the chief investigating officer in the case , who confirmed that the police had a theory that @entity3 had started the fire to feed his hero @entity193 also said how , through witness statements and a reconstruction , the police estimated there was a time space of approximately four minutes where the fire could have been started			1
discussing the lies that @entity3 told about his previous career , mr @entity188 called it ' complete fabrication ' , and mr @entity44 agreed it was ' absolute nonsense '			2
coroner @entity44 said : ' i have to be very frank but it occurs to me that mr @entity3 was a very sad ordinary man who had risen no higher than a bus driver on the @entity208 and wanted to ingratiate himself on people by feeding this spurious nonsense , which he carried through to the very end when he was sitting in an ambulance with all this tragedy around him			1
' ' @entity214 ' : @entity15 's mother @entity25 , left , said the outcome of the inquest ' has n't given me any answers ' , and said she just ' wants to know the truth ' about the fire at the farm near @entity120 ( right ) ' that 's true , ' mr @entity188 agreed , adding that there was ' ample evidence ' of mr @entity3 's ' dishonesty '			1
but mr @entity188 said although mr @entity3 had been arrested police had been advised by the @entity226 in march that they should not proceed as there was n't a reasonable prospect of a conviction on the evidence			1
the court also heard from dr @entity232 , who investigated the fire , and found that evidence from witnesses about black smoke which turned to flames could have indicated that a flammable liquid was used as well as a naked flame			2
' i just want to know the truth ' @entity15 's mother @entity25 but all experts who reviewed the fire agreed that the fire was started by a naked flame applied to the hay			1
the coroner recorded that the cause of @entity15 's death was the effects of smoke and fire			1
speaking after the inquest , the little girl 's mother said and she and her family believed the police theory and called for justice			0
' it has n't given me any answers , ' she said , ' we do n't know any more than we did			0
i just want to know the truth			0
' i would like it to go before a jury so that they can decide if he is guilty of murder			0
hopefully he will slip up or say something to incriminate himself			0
' me and the whole family believe the police 's theory , that he started the fire so he could rescue the girls and look like a hero			1
' senior investigating officer @entity188 said after the hearing : ' we note the findings of the coroner today			0
it is a matter of record that a then 37 - year - old man from the local area was arrested in connection with the enquiry			1
a file was presented to the @entity226 and it was decided that no further action should be taken			0
' this remains an ongoing investigation and we continue to appeal for information from the local community			0
i continue to urge anyone who has information regarding this case to contact the @entity294 and @entity295 on 101 or @entity296 , which they can do anonymously , on 0800 555 111			0
