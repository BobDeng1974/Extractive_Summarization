by @entity1 reporter published : 13:07 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 13:37 est , 22 july 2013 the @entity3 soldier who entered a village and murdered 16 civilians in @entity6 may now have documents that directly link his alleged crimes to use of the antimalarial drug mefloquine			1
staff sgt. @entity10 pleaded guilty last month of slaughtering village people in the country ’s @entity12 in march 2012			1
it has since been suggested that @entity16 ’ previous head injury , paired with use of the common drug , contributed to his homicidal actions but no direct link had previously been uncovered			1
now , a @entity22 ‘ adverse event ’ notification has been discovered from 2012 in which the pharmacist refers to a soldier who killed over a dozen @entity6 civilians after taking the mefloquine , which is known to adversely affect 5 - 10 percent of users and comes with a warning that those with previous brain trauma should not use the drug			1
link ? an @entity22 ' adverse event ' report has been uncovered that may link antimalarial drug mefloquine to a @entity3 soldier 's murder of 16 @entity6 civilians in 2012 cold blood : @entity43 staff sergeant @entity10 pleaded guilty last month to entering an @entity6 village and murdering 16 , mostly women and children as @entity16 faces a potential life sentence , his attorney @entity47 has publicly brought up his history with the controversial malarial drug — which is linked to paranoia , hallucinations and psychosis — while on a previous deployment in @entity55			1
however , @entity56 has not said if he intends cite mefloquine as a contributing factor to his client ’s crimes			0
@entity56 did admit he had no indication that the pharmacist 's notification was filed by anyone with direct knowledge of @entity16 ' use of the drug in @entity6			1
@entity43 officials have not commented on whether @entity16 took mefloquine in @entity6 leading up to the attack , citing confidentiality laws that protect a patient 's records			1
the defense has argued that @entity16 , the father of two from @entity78 , @entity79 , was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to @entity6			1
some experts urge against blaming the drug completely , however			0
' tens of millions of people take it , ' dr. @entity85 of the @entity86 told @entity90			0
' honestly , you can not implicate any one thing			0
to put it all on mefloquine is not fair			0
[ @entity16 ] already has a predisposition because of a traumatic brain injury and he has taken this drug in a stressful situation			2
you have to put it in context here ... but you ca n't exclude it			0
' the pill 's fault ? as @entity16 awaits sentencing , new documents link his behavior to the use of mefloquine , though he also admits to steroid and alcohol use @entity22 spokesperson @entity115 told @entity90 the anonymous report was authentic , though it 's impossible to know who submitted it			1
' these are voluntary reports , ' she said			0
' they are anonymous mainly because of the regulations protecting patient information , so names are not included			0
' dr. @entity125 , an @entity43 major and epidemiologist called mefloquine a ' zombie drug			0
' ' it 's dangerous and it should have been killed off years ago , ' said dr. @entity125 , who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain			2
he called it ' probably the worst - suited drug for the military ' and noted that its side effects can closely mirror symptoms of stress disorders related to combat , making diagnosis of neurological problems difficult			2
@entity16 slipped away from his remote southern @entity6 outpost at @entity145 early on march 11 , 2012 , and attacked compounds in nearby villages			1
most of the victims were women and children , and some of the bodies were piled and burned			0
the slayings drew such angry protests that the @entity3 temporarily stopped combat operations in @entity6			2
previous issue : @entity16 had a history of brain trauma , which should have precluded his use of the controversial , yet widely used , antimalarial drug previous use : @entity16 ' attorney @entity47 ( 2nd from left ) has already claimed to have documents showing his client was given mefloquine in @entity55 , though no proof he took it in @entity6 under questioning from the judge , army colonel @entity170 , @entity16 said that his use of illegal steroids , which he admitted taking to improve muscle tone and recovery time from missions , also ‘ increased my irritability and anger			1
’ during a nine - day pre-trial hearing last fall , witnesses testified that @entity16 had been upset by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier 's leg days before the shootings			2
gruesome : staff sergeant @entity16 admitted to shooting , and even burning his victims			1
men are pictured standing over where their loved ones were torched in march 2012 one corporal recounted that in the hours before the rampage he , @entity16 and a third soldier had been drinking whiskey together while watching the @entity196 film ‘ @entity197 , ’ which stars @entity198 as a former assassin bent on revenge			1
night - vision video footage taken from a surveillance balloon over the camp captured @entity16 ' arrest , showing him walking back to the post with a bed sheet or throw rug tied around his neck like a cloak as he is confronted by three soldiers who order him to drop his weapons and then take him into custody			2
one of them , drinking buddy corporal @entity215 , testified that @entity16 kept repeating the words , ‘ i thought i was doing the right thing , ’ and , ‘ it 's bad			0
’ @entity43 officials said some family members of the victims are expected to give statements at the sentencing hearing next month			0
the plea deal entered in june was similar to an agreement struck at @entity228 in april , when @entity43 sergeant @entity229 pleaded guilty to killing two fellow @entity3 servicemen at a military counseling center in @entity55 , near @entity233 's airport , in a 2009 shooting spree			1
@entity229 was sentenced to life in prison without parole following an abbreviated court - martial stemming from one of the worst cases of violence by an @entity3 soldier against other @entity3 troops			0
a jury will decide in august whether the soldier is sentenced to life with or without the possibility of parole			0
reparations ? a woman with her grandchild , who was killed by @entity16 in 2012			2
the @entity251 has since given $ 50,000 compensation for every victim while use of mefloquine is relatively common in the @entity257 , it is not a first - line treatment and is not indicated for use by anyone with a history of brain injury or seizure			0
