when @entity1 the dog fell from a cliff , no - one could have imagined it would result in one of the most fun - filled , novel @entity5 of his life			1
the @entity8 pooch broke both of his paws in his awful fall on @entity13 , meaning he is completely incapable of moving with two bright green casts encasing his front legs			1
his owner , @entity17 , from @entity18 in @entity8 inner eastern suburbs , was worried that his beloved pet would spend the summer cooped up in the apartment , unable to enjoy the sunshine			1
however , the dedicated owner had a brainwave - deciding that a stroller would be the perfect way to make sure that @entity1 would n’t miss out on a second of the action			1
truffle has a look of glee on his face that i ’ve never seen on that scale before when i wheel him around in the ‘ @entity35 , ’ mr @entity17 told @entity28			1
the sight of @entity1 the dog in his stroller , smiling happily with two casts on his front legs has been bringing smiles and laughter to everyone he encounters truffle is thrilled that he can join his best friend @entity45 on their favourite daily walks in @entity8 's sunshine the pet 's loving owner prepares to take his pooches on one of their walks , with @entity45 on his lead and truffle in his ' @entity57 ' ‘ i love the little guys to bits and hated the thought of @entity61 being confined to a one bedroom apartment for up to six weeks ... i only wish the solution did n't make me look quite as kooky as the stroller does ! ’ the result is both hilarious and incredibly sweet , as the pup is unable to contain his excitement every time he is strapped into the stroller , just like a child			1
mr @entity17 walks his dogs through the streets of his @entity74 neighbourhood everyday – a place where these types of ‘ kooky ’ activities are n’t out of place ! although @entity1 is enjoying every moment , mr @entity17 is a little more self - conscious , trying his best to ignore the funny looks they get while he pushes truffle down the street ‘ i am worried that people think i ’m attempting to channel a @entity83 or a @entity84 with my dog in a stroller ! ’ laughs mr @entity17			1
‘ in reality just trying to make sure my dogs , truffle and @entity90 , make the most of the summer and can get away from the apartment			2
’ ‘ i ’m so happy that @entity1 is out of the house again and roaming the streets with his partner in crime , @entity45			1
’ he is a sweet - natured pup , which means he happily poses for hilarious snaps to his owner 's delight the normally energetic pup was n't himself after the accident , and being confined to the home gave him a case of ' cabin fever ' , although his owner @entity17 says it was remarkable that he ' never complained ' his two gorgeous dogs love being outside and before @entity1 ’s accident would swim in the harbour everyday , walking through beautiful park lands to @entity113 in @entity8 ’s east or @entity116 ’s chair in the inner city			1
it was during one of these ventures that @entity1 ’s awful accident took place			2
‘ they are both @entity124 , a breed of @entity127 water dogs , so their favourite thing in the world is swimming			0
‘ after a swim on @entity13 , we were walking to the top of a viewing platform near @entity116 ’s chair when he slipped down a rock face			1
' it was a silly accident as ' there ’s a bit of a ‘ blonde ’ element to @entity1 , ' explained mr @entity17			1
' he took one step too far and disappeared over the edge			0
' it was a tense , distressing moment when the shaggy - haired pup disappeared from view			0
‘ i heard a horrible scream from the footpath below and someone later told me that they saw a dog flying through the air , ’ explains mr @entity17			2
‘ truffle ’s best friend @entity45 ran down to him straight away and we found a pretty crumpled truffle down below			2
’ after the accident during a fun day of swimming and fun by @entity8 's harbour ( left ) , an x-ray at the vets confirmed that he had broken both of his front paws ( right ) during the visit to the vets , despite the awful injuries he had suffered , @entity1 remained smiley they rushed him to the vet at nearby @entity170 where @entity171 confirmed that he had fractured both his front paws			1
‘ he was given plenty of @entity174 and wrapped up in plaster and bandages			0
they were bright orange casts but we just changed them to a bright green , ’ said mr @entity17			2
‘ he has little robot arms at the moment – he can lift them up and down but that ’s about it ! ’ although the pooch was very brave and ‘ never once complained ’ , he developed ‘ cabin fever ’ and it very quickly became clear that @entity1 needed to get outside and enjoy the sunshine ; a challenge as he is completely incapable if moving			2
‘ i tried carrying him a few times but he ’s close to 20 kilos so i could only carry him a couple of blocks			0
’ truffle 's owner says he did experience moments of cabin fever and was clearly missing his daily trips to the park and his active time in the sun both @entity17 's beloved dogs are very active			1
mr @entity17 walks them everyday , but so do other friends who stop by to visit the pups while he is at work , meaning their owner ' does n't know what they get up to everyday , but they know everyone in the area , even people i 've never seen before ! ' mr @entity17 had the ingenuous idea to ask if any of his friends had a spare stroller			1
it was an instant success			0
‘ once i put him in there , he was like a duck to water			0
he could n’t have been any happier , ’ explained mr @entity17			0
‘ he just loves being wheeled around on his ‘ throne ’ , the @entity57 , ' ‘ it ’s party central for him ! ’ the sight of the pup strapped in his stroller like a baby has been quite the novelty , bringing smiles to the faces of strangers			0
they are frequently stopped by people who ask to take selfies with @entity1 , who has a comical smile plastered to his face during every trip in his stroller			1
‘ he ’s loving the attention , although i ’m not a huge fan of all the looks we get from people in main street of @entity74 , ' said mr @entity17			0
‘ he could n’t be happier to smile and pose for selfies			0
’ mr @entity17 has shared lots of sweet pics on his @entity246 , @ pupsinthecity			0
@entity17 is trying to make sure truffle enjoys his summer as much as possible			2
the dog 's casts have just been changed from orange to green during a check up , for a touch of variety ! although mr @entity17 does laugh that @entity1 could become a diva and become attached to the stroller , long after his injuries have healed			1
‘ i just do n’t know how he ’ll return to normal life when the casts come off ! ’ the @entity18 resident laughed			0
an unexpected response has been the joy and laughter truffle and his stroller is bringing to the streets of @entity74 – a place which is home to some downtrodden and disadvantaged members of society			2
‘ you get the most sense of glee watching @entity1 enjoy himself in his stroller ! ’ explains mr @entity17			1
‘ it ’s nice walking around @entity74 with him , because a lot of people you do come across are having a pretty tough time or might be having a rotten day			0
‘ one of the unexpected benefits is that he can put smile on faces that would otherwise be pretty gloomy			0
’ his two pets have an incredible bond that has also been very special to witness			0
@entity45 and @entity1 have a beautiful friendship and their owner says it has been remarkable to see how much @entity45 has nurtured for his injured companion @entity90 before @entity1 's accident , preparing for the festive season with some bubbly @entity17 explains that @entity1 has a ' bit of a blonde streak ' truffle ’s playmate is a very special dog in his own right , as @entity45 has worked for the past four years as a ‘ therapy dog ’ in a mental health practice			1
‘ @entity45 sits with the psychiatrists and gives the clients that little bit of extra @entity174 that doctors ca n’t do , ’ said mr @entity17			2
the beautiful chocolate @entity305 provides company to people during appointments , to help and comfort them in vulnerable moments			0
‘ he gives the clients a nudge and they can pat him as they talk through the tough stuff , ’ said mr @entity17			0
@entity45 is a ' therapy dog ' , but is currently focusing his attention on providing 24/7 comfort to @entity1 truffle and @entity45 ( before the accident ) are wonderful companions to their owner , mr @entity17 , accompanying him to the park as he catches up on work - truly man 's best friends ! however , @entity45 is having a break as he commits fulltime to the task of helping his pal recover			1
‘ he ’s made the switch from being a therapy dog for humans to a therapy dog for his best mate ! ’ ‘ it ’s been amazing to watch , he honestly has n’t left @entity1 ’s side since the incident			2
he gives him nudges on the nose and licks on the paw to remind him that he ’s there with him			0
’ what began as a very sad event for the little family - of - three has now become a fun adventure , proving that a dog really is man ’s best friend			0
the most wonderful lesson has been in the face of adversity , the only thing we can control is how we respond			0
‘ i was thinking “ poor truffle , two front legs broken and he ’s completely out of action , how sad ! ” ‘ but he ’s embraced life to the full			1
he has n’t whinged once , just constantly smiling , ’ said mr @entity17			0
‘ when life serves us lemons , you ’ve just got to make the best possible lemon meringue pie ! ’ the dogs are thrilled that they can still spend time together during walks , with mr @entity17 explaining that @entity1 ( left ) only becomes anxious or fidgety when his best mate @entity45 ( right ) is out of view truffle is spreading smiles across the streets of @entity74 - now that he is in his stroller and more comfortable with his casts !			1
