state media also said @entity2 had the ' legitimacy ' to carry on the revolutionary battle initiated by his grandfather @entity10 and developed by his iron - fisted father @entity12			0
and it revealed the new leader would be upholding the same policies of his father , who died two weeks ago , while working to solve the ' burning issue ' of food shortages			0
it comes as @entity21 's president urged @entity22 to embrace a ' new era ' by using its recent leadership hand - over as an opportunity to transform @entity21 ties			1
but @entity28 also warned that @entity29 would respond sternly to any provocations			1
the @entity22 's three main state newspapers , in a policy - setting editorial traditionally published on @entity33 , said : ' @entity2 , the supreme leader of our party and our people , is the banner of victory and glory of @entity40 ( military - first ) @entity22 and the eternal centre of its unity			1
' they said the inexperienced young @entity12 , in his late 20s , is ' precisely ' identical to his father			0
and it added : ' the whole party , the entire army and all the people should possess a firm conviction that they will become human bulwarks and human shields in defending @entity2 unto death			0
' notably , the editorial called @entity22 's food problem ' a burning issue ' for the ruling @entity47 to solve and build ' a thriving country '			1
it added : ' glorify this year 2012 as a year of proud victory , a year when an era of prosperity is unfolding , true to the instructions of the great general @entity12			0
' carrying on : new leader @entity2 will continue the policies of his father @entity12 ( left ) and grandfather @entity10 ( right ) the destitute @entity66 has been suffering from chronic food shortages , relying heavily on outside aid			0
@entity21 president @entity28 said @entity12 's death was ' portending a sea change ' for the @entity71			1
he said : ' if @entity22 comes forward with a sincere attitude , it will be possible for us to work together to open a new era			1
' @entity22 said last week that it would never deal with @entity0 , but @entity2 's rise could offer a chance to improve ties that have suffered since @entity0 took office in 2008 and ended a no - strings - attached aid policy toward the @entity22			1
the young @entity12 had a brief meeting in @entity82 late last month with a former @entity21 first lady and a business leader who were leading private mourning delegations to pay respects to @entity12			1
@entity0 said the @entity71 is at a turning point and ' new opportunities always emerge amid such changes '			0
but he also warned that @entity21 would sternly respond to any @entity1 provocation			1
a @entity92 report said in november the isolated communist state needed food assistance for nearly 3 million of its 24 million people in 2012			0
many korea - watchers in the @entity21 's capital of @entity29 said the editorial did not suggest any major new changes in social or economic policies but appeared to be sensitive over the food issue			1
@entity102 , a professor at the @entity103 , said : ' in order to solidify and stabilise his grip on power , tackling the food problem is one of the top agenda topics @entity2 should deal with for now			0
' the editorial also assailed the @entity21 government for pursuing confrontation despite efforts by the @entity66 to reopen dialogue , and it repeated its demand for the withdrawal of the @entity118 military from the @entity21			2
but conspicuously absent from the editorial was any mention of @entity22 's nuclear arms programme , the key source of regional security concerns during @entity12 's reign			2
@entity125 , an @entity22 expert at @entity126 , said : ' @entity66 seems poised to focus its polices on stabilising domestic matters such as economic issues for the time being rather than to aggressively come forward with diplomatic affairs			2
' the @entity66 's remarks on the nuclear issue were featured prominently in previous @entity33 editorials			0
winning over the troops : @entity2 applauds military cadets at a camp in the capital of @entity82 on one of his first days as leader @entity141 was building in diplomatic contacts between the @entity22 and the @entity118 before the announcement of @entity12 's death , raising expectations the two sides may be closer to reaching a compromise to restart stalled talks aimed at ending the @entity22 's nuclear programme			2
those talks stalled in 2008 when @entity82 baulked at inspections of its nuclear sites under a 2005 deal by six countries - the two @entity154 , the @entity118 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 - to give the impoverished @entity22 aid in return for disarmament			2
' by giving up on comments on the nuclear issue , the @entity22 would secure much room in negotiations with the @entity118 and the other signatories of the six - party talks , ' said @entity102			2
in a fiery message last week that marked the first communication with the outside world since @entity12 's death , the @entity22 's @entity167 , which is seen as the apex of power , declared it would not deal with the current government in the @entity21			1
@entity21 president @entity28 angered @entity82 by cutting off aid to its destitute neighbour when he took office in 2008 , demanding nuclear disarmament and economic reform as preconditions to reopen food assistance and political engagement			1
tensions on the divided peninsula reached a new peak in 2010 when the @entity66 launched an artillery barrage into a @entity21 island , killing civilians			2

@entity22 are technically still at war under a truce ending the 1950 - 53 @entity193			0
experts believe the untested new leader , who had only been groomed for power since 2009 , will rule with the aid of a close coterie that includes his uncle and key power - broker , @entity201 , at least in the early stages of the leadership transition			0
