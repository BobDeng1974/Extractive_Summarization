' sometimes he did n't even have his hands on the wheel , ' she said			0
' he was scratching his head and driving along , opening his window and putting his hand out to say thank you to other drivers			2
' he just had no concern at all for the public or anyone he was carrying on the bus			2
' i expected him to end the call before he started the journey			0
he did n't - he just carried on driving off along the road on his phone			1
' i did n't know whether to say anything , whether to get up but he would have already committed the act of driving the bus while using his phone , knowing he should n't be doing that			1
' he was chatting away having a good old conversation			0
i was n't making any attempt to hide the fact that i was recording him , and i did speak while i was recording it			0
there was only me and my son and my baby on the bus			2
my baby had only broken his leg a week before and he was on the bus with a plaster cast in the pushchair			2

footage showed the driver had only one hand on the steering wheel for most of the journey through @entity6 ' i phoned the bus company up straight away as soon as i got to my destination , ' she said			1
' obviously they said they were n't very happy about it and so they said he would be suspended pending further investigations			0
' i understand he has now lost his job			0
i am satisfied with that , but to be honest i think it should be referred to the police because it is a criminal matter			0
' @entity104 , the general manager of @entity37 , said he was ' shocked and upset ' to be handed the footage			1

' we pride ourselves on employing highly professional , very skilled drivers and they , in turn , like to set a good standard and a good image for their profession			0
we are all very upset to think that any of our staff would behave in that way			0
' clearly the driver has done something he should n't do and he has been dealt with accordingly			2
