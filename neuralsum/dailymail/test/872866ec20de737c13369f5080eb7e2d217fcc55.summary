most scientists agree that a bit of stress is good for you , stimulating your body to produce an important hormone called cortisol			1
but too much is bad for your health and now an expert has revealed exactly why in a video			2
in it she reveals why prolonged periods of stress - due to money and work , for example - can inhibit the immune system and even lead to weaker bones			1
limited periods of stress are good , as they release the hormone cortisol			1
this is useful in helping you recover from very tense situations			1
but too much will lower your immune system and make your bones fragile			1
the science of stress was explained in a video by dr @entity37 from the @entity21 for the @entity38			2
cortisol is known as the ' stress hormone '			2
normally , it 's present in the body at higher levels in the morning , and at its lowest at night			0
although stress is n't the only reason that cortisol is secreted into the bloodstream , it has been termed the ' stress hormone ' as it is released when the body is in ' @entity51 ' mode			2
as she explains , when you encounter a stressful situation ‘ your body will start releasing [ the hormones ] adrenaline and norepinephrine within seconds to prepare you to fight - or more likely , take flight			0
’ after a minute or two your body is flooded with cortisol , which is vital in keeping you healthy in tense situations			1
cortisol puts more glucose into your bloodstream so that when the adrenaline is gone you do n’t crash			0
‘ it also kicks your liver into gear , pumping out the extra glucose that ’s now sloshing around inside of you , ’ dr @entity37 explained			0
but if you stay stressed for too long , it can have negative effects			0
after a minute or two of being stressed ( stock image shown ) , your body is flooded with cortisol , which is vital in keeping you healthy in tense situations			1
but too much will lower your immune system , and could also make your bones more fragile , according to dr @entity37 from the @entity21 ‘ cortisol inhibits some of your immune responses , meaning you ’re more likely to get sick and it takes longer for wounds to heal , ’ dr @entity37 continued			1
‘ @entity79 also slows bone growth , meaning sustained levels can lead to weaker , more fragile bones			0
‘ and because cortisol acts on a part of your brain that controls appetite , it also increases your desire for fatty and sugary foods			0
’ one positive side effect of too much cortisol , though , is that cortisol is good at reducing swelling or itching in its medical form - known as hydrocortisone			0
however , remaining stressed for too long is still not advisable - and dr @entity37 recommends eating healthy food , exercising and getting plenty of sleep to beat stress .			0
