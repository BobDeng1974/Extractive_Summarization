@entity0 has vowed to make @entity1 stronger and insisted there are no regrets about sanctioning @entity5 ’s sale to @entity6			1
@entity5 ’s £ 75million move was confirmed on wednesday but his four - month stadium ban for biting @entity10 defender @entity9 at the @entity11 means he could not be unveiled by head coach @entity12 and sporting director @entity13			2
while @entity12 and @entity13 were fielding questions in @entity15 about the @entity18 striker ’s character flaws , a shadow @entity1 squad lost their opening pre-season game 2 - 1 against @entity22			1
belief : @entity0 ( above ) has vowed to make @entity1 stronger after losing @entity5 afterwards , @entity0 was eager to bring closure to the @entity5 affair			1
it has been argued that @entity1 ’s ambitions will be compromised by losing the 31 goals which @entity5 scored last season			1
but @entity0 countered that they are not a one - man team and believes the four signings he has made — with the promise of more to come — will maintain their progress			1
‘ in my short career as a manager i have lost people who i thought would be key players , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but then you go away , reflect and ensure you bring in the right replacement			0
always , after that , my teams have been better teams			0
‘ @entity5 missed a lot of our games but we still won a lot of those games so we just have to move on			2
we have loved working with a fantastic player , but a player who obviously benefitted from our work at @entity1			2
new look : @entity1 line up for their first pre-season friendly in @entity54 on the move : @entity1 's star striker @entity5 ( left ) has left for @entity6 ‘ he ’s gone and we wo n’t dwell on it			1
this is @entity1 , not a small club but one of the great ones in world football			2
we had great service out of @entity5 but it ’s one we ca n’t worry too much about now			2
' there is a lot of work going on to get in the right player			0
we have every confidence in the group we have , plus we will bring in more signings			0
hopefully they can improve to the levels @entity5 improved			0
’ @entity0 has signed @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , who missed the defeat to @entity22 after turning his ankle			0
the next target is @entity80			0
@entity81 have had a £ 10million bid accepted for the @entity83 left back but @entity1 will match it and are confident @entity80 will choose @entity84			0
this will be a summer of change at @entity84 , with other targets including @entity89 ’s @entity88 and @entity91 defender @entity90 , but there is no question there will be a period of adjustment following @entity5 ’s exit			1
bad start : the @entity98 were beaten in their first pre-season match of the season @entity0 was forced to tackle a number of contentious issues because of @entity5 ’s behaviour but there was no sense that @entity1 ’s manager felt relieved to see a man who was voted @entity108 and @entity109 depart			1
‘ i have great respect for @entity5 as a person and player , i know him deeper than most , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he was a good man , great performer for @entity1 and hopefully i have played a part in his progress			0
‘ he ’s gone to @entity6 , a club he wanted to play for , and now we ’ll move on			0
believe me , it will be a really exciting season for us			0
’ @entity117 believe they can sign on - loan @entity1 winger @entity118 for £ 4m up front			0
yellow peril : @entity22 players celebrate with @entity122 after the opening goal video new @entity1 signing eyes @entity125 trophy			1

@entity0 believes he will make @entity1 stronger this summer
reds have lost star striker @entity5 to @entity6
@entity0 has already made four summer signing and hopes for more
