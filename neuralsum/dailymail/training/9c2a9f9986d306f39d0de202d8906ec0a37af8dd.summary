the once dignified faces of famous historical figures have been transformed by a graphic artist , who replaced them with those of infants			2
the series , called ' the @entity7 ' , was created by @entity9 advertising photographer @entity8			1
the 26 - year - old enlisted the help of his daughters @entity13 and @entity14 and the work of several @entity16			2
confused : graphic artist @entity8 used @entity17 to superimpose his daughters ' faces onto famous figures in paintings by @entity16			1
pictured , baby @entity22 from a painting by @entity24 royal : @entity27 's portrait of @entity28 of @entity29 has been transformed after mr @entity8 planted a picture of his daughter over the monarch 's face using photographs of his young children , mr @entity8 placed their faces over 18th and 19th century figures , including @entity22 , holy roman emperor @entity38 of the @entity39 , and @entity41 naval officer , @entity43 1st @entity42			1
mr @entity8 , who is from @entity44 in @entity9 , said : ' this is not the way the kings , queens and admirals saw themselves , but rather the way we see them a few hundred years later			1
' i imagine all these leaders being childish and fighting over things that really were n't there to fight over , like how children would behave			2
' the images are created by using old paintings by @entity16 , taking new photographs of infants in the same poses and using the same light as in the old paintings			2
screaming : this @entity65 painting of admiral @entity66 is much more humorous after mr @entity8 's handiwork yawn : a grey - haired baby @entity43 , the 1st @entity42 , a @entity41 naval officer , from a painting by @entity72 happy : the artist 's smiling daughter has her face pasted over @entity76 of @entity9 in this painting by @entity78 ' to create the final result , i took the babies and put their faces on top of these paintings in @entity17			1
' the original paintings were created by artists such as @entity72 , @entity65 and @entity87			0
mr @entity8 added : ' with planning , finding the right painting , setting up the lighting and doing the @entity17 work , it takes about one day per image			1
' people tend to find the set of photographs humorous			0
' it 's something different that you do n't see every day so the first reaction is usually a laugh			0
' from what i can remember i started to get really interested photography when i was about 14 years old			0
' i put the photos into @entity17 and created all kinds of weird images , and it 's carried on from there			0
' disgusted : the dignified portrait of lord @entity109 , a @entity41 admiral and member of @entity111 , now has a hilariously sour expression @entity113 : @entity38 , the holy roman emperor of the @entity39 , pulls a funny face in this painting by an unknown artist adorable : baby @entity119 , 1st @entity121 , who was an admiral in the @entity122 , from a painting by @entity72 drooling : a majestic picture of @entity125 , 1st @entity126 , an admiral in the @entity122 , from a painting by @entity65 , now has a dribbling baby face cheeky : baby captain @entity130 of the 14th @entity131 , from a painting by @entity72 cute : @entity134 statesman and diplomat @entity133			0
@entity136 now looks confused in this painting by @entity78			0
