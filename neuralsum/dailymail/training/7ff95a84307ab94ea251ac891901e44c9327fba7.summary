@entity0 played his 200th game for @entity2 on saturday			1
the club have spent a fortune on players , but if you want value for money , you need look no further than the little @entity9 magician			2
in terms of consistency , his performances are hard to match			1
he does n’t cause any problems , he looks like he trains hard and he is a fantastic , technical player			2
he must be a manager ’s dream			2
city are so much better with him in the side , as the table below shows , and he is the kind of player you are happy to pay to watch			2
with @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 to come over @entity26 , @entity0 could be just the man to help @entity2 get through their striker crisis			1
he is a class act and an absolute monster and i ’m pleased he ’s overcome his injury problems			2
damaging your achilles tendon is always a worry — players do n’t always get back to those same levels again			2
but @entity37 is flying and i ’m a big fan			1
it ’s good to see players like him catching the eye now			0
it ’s not just your @entity56 and @entity57 who are shining : there ’s @entity37 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			1
there ’s a lot of striking quality in the @entity66 this season and those players are scoring a high percentage of their team ’s goals , as the table below shows			1
even @entity73 has come back in and proved himself when it looked as if he might not get a game at @entity76			0
it ’s so vital to have a front man who can lead the line well and score goals , and this season almost every team have one			1
all i know is i would n’t want to be a defender this @entity26			0
@entity37 struck in the first half of @entity86 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity41 @entity29 scored a hat - trick as @entity30 came from two goals down to beat @entity23 on saturday @entity89 keeps on motoring what a vein of form @entity29 has hit			1
he ca n’t stop scoring			0
he does n’t seem to get many chances but when he does , he sticks them away			0
he is an arch goal poacher and saved @entity30 in a fantastic game against @entity23			1
that ’s 11 @entity66 goals now this season , but as our map shows , the majority of them have been scored on or around the penalty spot			1
he loves to sniff out opportunities and pounce			0
his conversion rate is impressive , too			0
he ’s seventh in the league in that respect , and behind top man @entity109			1
but he is above @entity110 , which shows just how @entity59 is more than capable of coping at this level			0
@entity114 @entity113 celebrates after giving @entity116 's side the lead against @entity24 @entity119 's big challenge @entity113 has taken plenty of stick from people , myself included			1
there was a feeling the £ 30million price tag did n’t add up to the quality we ’ve seen			0
he ’s scored two world - class goals this season , including the winner on saturday , as our graphic shows			1
but one was in the @entity135 and , no disrespect intended , the other was against @entity24			1
i still feel he ’s a bit lightweight but credit where credit is due			0
the key for @entity113 now is to go and affect big games			1
he needs to score in a derby match or do something where we can all sit back and say : ‘ so that ’s why they paid £ 30million			0
’ that ’s the next challenge			0
@entity150 will boost @entity113 - @entity116 per @entity151 appeared to duck out of the way for @entity155 's late equaliser at @entity156 no defence for sloppy goals aside from @entity161 ’s goal , the others conceded at @entity156 summed up @entity155 and @entity163 ’s seasons : too many sloppy mistakes			1
both sides can be a joy to watch but they concede so softly			0
@entity168 ’s header was good but @entity169 showed no urgency to get back on the line and @entity151 ducked out of the way			0
i ’m sorry , but that ’s just not good enough			0
i saw a lot of positives for @entity155 and it would have been a travesty if they had lost			0
they conceded goals last year but the difference then was they kept scoring — at the same stage they had 42 goals , twice as many as 2014 - 15 , and @entity185 had 19 of them			2
that ’s only two fewer than the whole squad this season			2
@entity191 ’s return will help and on sunday there were signs of improvement			0
away the lads ... three wins in a row at @entity196 is an amazing achievement for @entity25 and since they lost 8 - 0 at @entity200 , they are undefeated away from home			0
that form is so important for the teams who are scrapping at the bottom of the table because it eases the pressure on your home games			0
watching @entity211 , you always feel you want a bit more from him because he ’s got so much ability			0
but scoring big goals against your rivals is the kind of thing that can make you an icon at your club			2
@entity155 's @entity168 celebrates after scoring a dramatic late equaliser against @entity163 in injury time @entity211 watches on as his powerful strike flies past the dive of @entity225 goalkeeper @entity224 all systems go it did n’t take long for people to ditch 3 - 5 - 2 at the start of the season but it was back in fashion this weekend			1
@entity155 , @entity41 , @entity86 , @entity233 and @entity200 all played it and i would n’t be surprised if others join in			1
it can help you get more possession , rotation and movement so it ’s definitely not dead yet			0
@entity242 strike it @entity241 last week my old club @entity242 did ok against @entity155 but when @entity243 made six changes for that game , the next one was always going to be interesting			0
they hit @entity249 for six and @entity250 scored two			2
i ’d be surprised if he ’s not in the @entity66 soon , either with @entity242 or another team			0
@entity73 races away to celebrate after scoring his first league goal with his feet since april 2013 spurs have won their last four @entity66 games 2 - 1 when @entity62 has scored @entity257 nine - @entity258 was undoubtedly the man of the match for @entity2 , much of the team ’s second - half attacking impetus on saturday came through full backs @entity264 and @entity265			1
the defenders — who both laid on goals — have provided nine assists each since the start of last season — a total betteredonly by @entity273 ’s @entity272			1
27 - @entity73 scored his first @entity66 goal with his foot since april 2013 — a period of 27 games			2
his last four goals have all come from his head			2
eight - following their 3 - 0 win against @entity34 , @entity2 have won eight matches in a row in all competitions — a run stretching back to late november			1
one - the pressure may be on @entity288 manager @entity287 with his side sitting bottom of the league , but @entity292 has n’t fared much better this season — his @entity233 team are only three points better off than the @entity296 , with just one win in their last 16 games			2
2 - 1 - @entity255 have won their last four @entity66 games 2 - 1 when @entity62 has got his name on the scoresheet — as he did against @entity24			1
1,510 - @entity113 finally scored his first league goal for @entity255 on saturday			1
the @entity304 midfielder had to wait 1,510 minutes for his duck to end			0
one - @entity161 has been @entity155 ’s best player on occasions this season , but his opener against @entity163 on sunday was his first goal at @entity156 since the 3 - 2 win over @entity2 last april			1
he is also yet to provide an assist in the @entity66 .			0

@entity0 has *excelled* for @entity2 this season
@entity37 has scored 18 per cent of @entity86 's goals so far
former @entity24 man @entity29 has scored more than half of @entity30 's
@entity113 needs to turn his talent into consistent performances
