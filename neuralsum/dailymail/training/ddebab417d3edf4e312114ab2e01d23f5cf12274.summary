in her new @entity3 column last week , @entity6 advised @entity3 readers to bring ' everything from sunblock and sunglasses to a mackintosh and umbrella ' and to wear comfortable shoes			2
and as the clouds gathered and the heavens opened over @entity32 's today , her precautions must have come in very useful			0
