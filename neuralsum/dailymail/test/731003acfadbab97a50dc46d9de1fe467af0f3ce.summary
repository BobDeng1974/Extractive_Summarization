underlining a change across the nation , nearly 90per cent of @entity4 adults now say they have health insurance , according to an extensive survey released monday			1
researchers behind the @entity9 say the number of uninsured @entity4 is now at a record low			1
when tracking began in 2008 roughly 14per cent of citizens were uninsured , peaking at 18per cent in the third quarter of 2013			1
but marking a shift in the trend , for the first three months of this year the rate dropped to 11.9per cent			1
whether the new findings turn out to be a high - water mark for president @entity22 's health care law , or a milestone on the path toward his goal of getting virtually all @entity4 residents covered , remains to be seen			2
underlining a change across the nation , nearly nine in ten adults now say they have health insurance , according to an extensive survey released monday the law 's future is still up in the air , and will turn on factors ranging from an upcoming @entity37 decision on consumer subsidies to actions by @entity41 leaders in states opposed to @entity44 expansion			2
the latest update from the @entity9 survey overlaps with the period when the health law 's second sign - up season was winding down			1
coverage gains from 2014 - 2015 translate to about 3.6 million fewer adults uninsured since the fall , before open enrollment got under way , according to @entity9			1
' @entity55 had three major objectives : increase coverage , slow the rate of increase in costs , and improve health , ' said @entity62 , research director for the poll			2
' the first one is clearly a win			0
coverage is increasing ; there is no question about it			0
' on balance , an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage since the fall of 2013 , when the law 's first open enrollment season was about to begin , according to @entity9			1
the uninsured rate lowest since @entity9 and @entity74 began tracking in 2008 ' a big outstanding question is what will happen over the next couple of years , ' said @entity79 , a health insurance expert with the nonpartisan @entity81			1
' to meet expectations , enrollment has to continue to grow and push the number of uninsured down			2
' the @entity9 survey is closely followed because it combines the depth of government - sponsored research with the timeliness of media polls			1
pollsters interview 500 people a day , nearly every day of the year			2
one of the questions they ask is whether people have health insurance			0
the health care law offers subsidized private insurance for people who do n't have access to job - based coverage , combined with an expansion of @entity44 aimed at low - income adults in states that accept it			1
big states like @entity108 and @entity109 are among those refusing to expand @entity44			0
the law requires nearly all @entity4 to have coverage , either through an employer , a government program , or by purchasing their own plan			2
those remaining uninsured risk fines			2
it also provides subsidies to help low - to moderate - income people buy their own insurance			0
comparing the most recent sign - up period with the first open enrollment season , the survey found that the uninsured rate declined at a slightly slower pace this time around			1
in the first three months of this year , the uninsured rate fell by one percentage point			1
over the same period last year there was a 1.5 percentage - point decline			0
from government officials to local volunteers , many people involved with the health care law expected some kind of second - year slowdown			0
open enrollment season was shorter , and those who had remained uninsured were seen as more skeptical about the value of coverage			0
the survey also found that @entity138 saw the biggest coverage gains of any ethnic or racial group			0
the uninsured rate dropped 8.3 points among @entity142 since the end of 2013			1
even so , @entity138 are still more likely to be uninsured			0
' at a time when republicans are very keenly trying to court the @entity138 vote , a large chunk of @entity138 are gaining insurance via the @entity149 , ' @entity62 said			0
president @entity22 's health care law requires nearly all @entity4 to have coverage , either through an employer , a government program , or by purchasing their own plan - those remaining uninsured risk fines the most notable improvement has been among those making less than $ 36,000 a year , a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance recent gains in coverage have benefited people up and down the income ladder			1
but the most notable improvement has been among those making less than $ 36,000 a year , a group that traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance			0
their uninsured rate dropped 8.7 points since the end of 2013			1
although the economic recovery is likely to be contributing to coverage gains , the uninsured rate is now significantly lower than it was in early 2008 , before the recession			2
that suggests that the gains in coverage are due to more than an improving economy			0
five years after its passage , the biggest question now for @entity22 's health care law is a @entity37 challenge			0
opponents of the law argue that its literal language only allows the government to subsidize premiums in states that set up their own online insurance markets			0
most have not done so , defaulting to the federal @entity189			0
supporters say that while some provisions may be confusing when read in isolation , the intent of @entity192 was to help consumers in every state pay their premiums			0
a decision in that case is expected by late june			0
the survey results were based on landline and cellphone interviews conducted from january 2 to march 31 with a random sample of 43,575 adults ages 18 and older			1
for results based on the total sample , the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point .			1
