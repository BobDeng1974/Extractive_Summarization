by @entity0 @entity1 will launch her very own book being @entity4 next week yes it 's true ; i 'm releasing a book			1
being @entity1 will reveal lots of tales from my childhood , teenage years and life in @entity12 - as well as my favourite beauty tips of course			1
i 'm so excited for it to come out , and so this week i thought i 'd show you all how to achieve my book cover look			1
step one : prep the skin as a @entity12 girl it 's very important to me to have perfect blemish free skin so it 's a necessary requirement to prep the skin before applying make - up			1
start by cleansing the skin with @entity28 , followed by the @entity29 - this is a really nice base just before applying foundation			1
then spritz some @entity31 onto the face â € “ this hydrating skin mist is perfect to use just before applying makeup			1
step two : smokey - shimmery eyes for this look i 've gone for a bronze smoky eye			2
to stick with the elegant @entity12 look apply @entity40 with lots of @entity42 and a set of @entity45 eyelashes			2
then take the @entity46 in @entity47 , starting with a nice light shimmer base on the lid			2
after this , create some depth in the eye by using a deep brown and a tiny bit of black in the crease of the lid			2
step three : define the @entity59 use the @entity60 to define your brows			2
after applying the powder with an angled brush comb it through so the brows do n't look too harsh			0
@entity4 recommends using an angled brush when applying colour to your eyebrows to avoid looking to harsh although @entity4 had a make - up artist at her shoot she says her cover look can easily be achieved at home @entity75 : @entity77 - kissed skin take a foundation brush and apply @entity79 to the face			1
the foundation lasts for a long time girls so a little goes a long way for that flawless , natural look			0
step five : @entity86 use the @entity87 and @entity88 to contour the face and create killer cheekbones			0
follow up by brushing @entity91 in miss @entity92 gently into the apples of the cheeks			0
to get a professional look use a brush to apply your lipstick and for a glamorous cover girl look for a big night out try a pair of false eyelashes @entity4 says to create depth in the eye area apply a deep brown colour step six : perfect @entity106 last but not least are the lips			1
as i always say you never know when a kiss is coming so you 're better off being prepared			0
for the perfect pinky pout swipe a layer of @entity113 in @entity114 over the lips			0
for a better and more professional result use a brush to apply , moving it vertically along the lines of your lips for a more even finish			0
we 're all human and we all make mistakes , so after applying your lipstick use a cotton bud to clean up any mistakes			0
to avoid the embarrassment of having lipstick on your teeth , you can put your index finger in your mouth and drag it out ; this will catch up any lipstick that would have made a stain on your teeth			0
you can get all the products to create this look on @entity138			0
