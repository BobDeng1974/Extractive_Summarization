by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 13:23 est , 17 october 2012 solved : the ' man with no name ' has been identified as @entity2 , 34 , of @entity3 , @entity4 the mystery of a ' man with no name ' whose body washed up on an isolated beach almost 25 years ago has at last been solved thanks to advances in forensic science			1
when a six - month police investigation failed to establish the identity of a body that washed ashore on a north @entity18 beach in 1989 , saddened villagers held a poignant funeral service at a local churchyard			1
now , almost a quarter of a century later , police have used dna evidence to identify the mystery man as @entity2 , 34 , of @entity3 , @entity4			2
mr @entity2 's body was discovered by fishermen on @entity27 beach on october 9th , 1989			1
the remarkable breakthrough came after detectives from @entity18 and @entity31 's major investigation team took a fresh look at the region 's missing persons cases			1
the team carried out an exhumation to obtain @entity22 from mr @entity2 's teeth , which was then cross-checked against the missing persons database			1
detective chief inspector @entity39 , who said it was rare to solve investigations dating back as far as this one , said : ' on april 19th last year an exhumation was carried out to obtain dna from mr @entity2 's body , ' he said			2
' from the teeth i got a dna profile and put this on the missing person database and found a match			0
' the detective contacted mr @entity2 's sister , 67 - year - old @entity50 , of @entity3 , to give her the news and finally offer the family some closure			1
the painstaking process of re-examining the old cases , some of which go back as far as the early 1960s , is part of a bid to help families desperately hoping to be reunited with their loved ones or at least to find answers regarding their fate , the detective explained			0
desolate : mr @entity2 's body washed ashore at @entity27 beach in north @entity18 in 1989 saddened villagers organised a poignant burial at a nearby churchyard back in 1990 , where a photo of mr @entity2 has now been placed on the grave @entity73 said unidentified bodies recovered in @entity18 and @entity31 , such as mr @entity2 ’s , were also part of their investigations and the team used a national missing person database to help crack these cases			1
' the person is added to the list and is shown as missing			0
then we also have a list of human remains			0
but in this case the home force - the local force - had captured dna from mr @entity2 ’s family and put it on the database			2
' he explained that @entity22 was usually taken from the missing person but if police were unable to collect any then a virtual profile was made up using family members , such as the mother , father , siblings or children			2
it would not have been standard practice to collect dna before 1995			0
now mrs @entity50 and other members of her brother ’s family will be making the 118 - mile journey to @entity18 to put him to rest after organising a dedication service at @entity27 ’s @entity105 , where mrs @entity50 will read a eulogy			0
mrs @entity50 has said anyone that attended the original service in 1990 was welcome at the dedication for her brother			0
the service will be held on november 1st at 10.30am			0
mr @entity2 's family will travel from @entity3 to hold a dedication service at @entity27 's @entity105 next month			1

the body that washed ashore on a north @entity18 beach in 1989 has now been identified as @entity2 , 34 , of @entity3 , @entity4
