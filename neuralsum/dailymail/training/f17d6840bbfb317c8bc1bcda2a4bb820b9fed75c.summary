by @entity0 and @entity1 ministers hailed a ‘ major milestone ’ last night as official figures showed @entity5 ’s economy has reached a record high – surpassing its peak before the recession			1
@entity10 said the fact that the economy is now larger than it was before the financial crisis of 2008 was a ‘ credit ’ to the hard work of @entity5 workers and businesses			1
the pace of economic recovery over the last year has taken experts by surprise , after the worst downturn for at least a century			2
total output across the @entity5 rose by a healthy 0.8 per cent between april and june – meaning the economy is now 0.2 per cent bigger than it was in early 2008 , before the crisis			1
but gdp per capita – the size of the economy divided by the population – is still 5.5 per cent below the pre-recession peak			0
ministers hailed ‘ a big day for @entity5 ’ following the deepest slump in post-war history			2
gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – crashed by 7.2 per cent under @entity52 in 2008 - 09 as the financial crisis took its toll on families and businesses			1
it has taken more than six years for output to return to its pre-recession peak , bringing the longest downturn for at least 100 years to an end			0

’ mr @entity35 added : ‘ today we reach a major milestone in our long - term economic plan			1

’ he claimed the economy had been brought ‘ back from the brink ’ because of the actions of the @entity82			0

’ but he added : ‘ wages after inflation are down over £ 1,600 a year since 2010 , housebuilding under this government is at its lowest level since the 1920s and business investment is lagging behind our competitors			0

this is its biggest half - year profit since it received a £ 46billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008			2
