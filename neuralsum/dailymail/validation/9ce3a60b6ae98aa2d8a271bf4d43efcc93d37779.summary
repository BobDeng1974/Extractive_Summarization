it has long been claimed by allotment - holders that their fruit and vegetables beat those from supermarket shelves			1
now scientists have proved home - grown produce is not just tastier but healthier too			1
a study , carried out by experts at @entity12 , found that tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health - improving nutrients than those that are mass - produced			1
@entity17 : a @entity12 study found that home - grown tomatoes are sweeter and richer in health - improving nutrients than those that are mass - produced the concentration of natural sugars , anti-oxidants and nutrient rich compounds called phenols peaked in the home - grown tomatoes , the study for a @entity25 show revealed			1
professor @entity32 , deputy director of science at @entity34 , claimed mass - market tomatoes are often bred for their appearance rather than quality , that herbicides are used and that they are harvested early and artificially ripened to improve shelf life			1
she said all these things can damage the flavour and the nutrient level in the fruit			0
' supermarkets are often looking for tomatoes that are a particular size because that 's how the public want it , ' she said			0
' some of these tomatoes are smaller and they do n't grow in a uniform size , which makes them difficult for supermarkets to sell			0
it 's about educating the public			0
people do n't mind if something grown in their garden is not beautifully round but would they buy it from a supermarket ? ' one example is the @entity61 cherry tomato , which was found to contain three times as much sugar as the shop - bought variety , giving it a far sweeter taste			2
while this experiment was with tomatoes , professor @entity32 said results would be similar in other fruits and vegetables			2
tasty : professor @entity32 from @entity12 said results would be similar in other fruits and vegetables professor @entity32 , who led the research for @entity77 show @entity34 on a plate , said : ' they are not going to be a cure for a disease but if you are eating them as part of a mixed diet they will definitely contribute to a healthier life â€“ it 's the mediterranean diet effect , having natural anti-oxidants in your diet			1
' if you 're eating enough of these it will build up to have an effect			0
' the show , starting on monday , follows presenter @entity95 , 46 , and chef @entity96 , 65 , as they create a vegetable garden			0
the experiment saw professor @entity32 take the pulp from different varieties of tomatoes and analyse it using sophisticated machinery to work out the concentration of different sugars and nutrients .			2

study found that home - grown tomatoes are sweeter and richer in nutrients
@entity12 discovered they have more natural sugars and anti-oxidants
expert said mass - market tomatoes bred for their appearance , not quality
she claimed results would be exactly the same in all fruit and vegetables
