@entity5 , 38 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , had already been at work for four hours when he got a call to say his partner @entity10 had gone in labour			1
he immediately called his employers at @entity13 and asked for a cover driver to be organised so he could finish work early to get to the @entity16			1
@entity5 was sacked from his job as a bus driver for @entity13 because he left work to see the birth of his first son , @entity20 @entity5 , who had been a bus driver since the age of 21 and had worked for @entity13 for 10 weeks , drove his bus back to the depot and was told he was sacked			1
‘ obviously i wanted to be there for the birth of my first son , what father would n't want that ? ‘ i made several phone calls to the office trying to come up with a solution to the problem			2
i did n't say i had to leave straight away			0
i did n't stop the bus and just rush off			2
‘ i did what i thought was the responsible thing			0
i called the office and asked if they could arrange for a cover driver to take over my route			1
i said i would call back later to see what arrangements had been made and in the meantime i carried on driving the bus			1
‘ i made more calls but i was getting nowhere so i drove my bus back to the depot			1
i waited until i had dropped off all my passengers and the bus was empty before i went back			2
@entity47 of @entity13 said cover was arranged for @entity5 but he left work in breach of his contract he added : ‘ i have been in touch with @entity53 but i was told it had always been a gentleman 's agreement that a man could always leave to go see the birth of their child ‘ because of that no law has ever been implemented			1
' ‘ i was told by the boss of the company i had sacked myself because of my action			0
i was just looking for a little understanding , it was an emergency and i wanted to be with @entity10			0
‘ i have been hard working and never let them down			0
i thought they would be compassionate			0

he came back to the depot a little after 10am with an empty bus and he was told he was in breach of his contract and he was dismissed			1
