by @entity0 the @entity1 has announced plans to place 50 nuclear missiles in storage as part of a controversial arms treaty with @entity7			1
the @entity8 said it would be keeping its current force of 450 land - based missiles , but has agreed to remove 50 of them from launch silos - although it added these silos would be maintained so they could return to active use in future			1
the removal is part of a plan to bring the @entity1 into compliance with an 2011 arms control treaty with @entity7 known as @entity21 - which has the subject of intense debate between @entity1 politicians and weapons experts when plans were announced ahead of the 2010 mid-term elections			1
defence : a @entity30 rocket is launched from @entity31 in @entity32			0
the test base is one of the sites that will not be hit with missile reductions aim : @entity1 president @entity37 shake hands with his @entity7 counterpart @entity39 , after signing the controversial new start treaty in 2011 once the 50 nuclear missiles are placed in storage , the launch - ready total of @entity43 intercontinental ballistic missiles would be the lowest the @entity1 has had since 1962 the decision to keep the silos in ' warm ' status - empty of missiles but capable of returning to active use - comes after members of @entity51 from the states that host missile bases - @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 - warned they must not be dismantled			1
senator @entity57 , a @entity56 @entity58 , called the @entity8 's announcement ' a big win for our nation 's security and for @entity64 , ' home of the @entity65 with 150 @entity30 3 missiles			2
' icbms are the most cost - effective nuclear deterrent , and keeping silos warm is a smart decision and the kind of common sense @entity56 expect from their leaders , ' he added			1
the decision to put 50 missiles in storage but not eliminate any of their launch silos is a departure from the practice followed throughout the 50 - plus year history of intercontinental ballistic missiles			1
a senior defense official who briefed reporters on the plan and its rationale said the @entity8 had never before structured its icbm force with a substantial number of missiles in standby status			2
the official spoke under @entity8 ground rules that did not permit her name to be used			0
in the air : @entity1 @entity95 strategic bombers will be trimmed from the current deployed total of 93 to 60 - including 19 @entity98 stealth bombers ( pictured ) - with an additional six bombers available in a non-deployed status despite the 2011 new start deal , both @entity7 and the @entity1 have an extensive nuclear weapons arsenal			1
in @entity1 hands there are approximately 5,114 nuclear warheads , including tactical , strategic , and non-deployed weapons			2
according to the latest official @entity21 declaration , the @entity1 deploys 1,654 strategic nuclear warheads on 792 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles , submarine - launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers			1
the @entity112 estimates the @entity1 ' non-deployed strategic arsenal is approximately 2,800 warheads , with a tactical nuclear arsenal numbering 500 warheads			2
an unconfirmed number of additional @entity1 warheads are awaiting dismantlement			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , is estimated to have approximately 1,480 deployed strategic warheads , with another 1,022 in non-deployed status			0
it is thought @entity7 may have several thousand additional warheads awaiting dismantlement			0
the decision was not met with universal praise however			0
@entity127 , an arms control expert at the @entity112 , called the administration 's announcement disappointing and a shift away from nuclear weapon reductions			0
' this decision appears to have more to do with the administration surrendering to the @entity135 caucus [ in @entity51 ] than with strategic considerations about national security , he said			0
the @entity8 said it will cost $ 19.3million over five years to keep the 50 launch silos and missiles in standby status			1
the missiles themselves will be stored at the base or , in some cases , sent to a depot for repairs or maintenance			0
keeping all 450 silos meant the @entity8 had to make steeper reductions in the @entity151 's sea - based nuclear force in order to comply with the @entity21 , or @entity153 , by 2018			1
the @entity151 will reduce the number of deployed and non-deployed submarine - launched ballistic nuclear missiles to 280 from the current 336			2
decrease : @entity7 is already is well below the 700 - deployed weapon limit and , at the most recent reporting period last october , had only 473 compared to 809 in @entity1 hands			1
pictured are @entity7 @entity161 missiles the @entity151 has 14 ohio - class submarines armed with missiles but only 12 will count as deployed because two will be undergoing long - term maintenance at a given time during the 10 - year life of the @entity21 treaty			1
the @entity151 is embarking on a multibillion - dollar program to build a replacement for the current fleet			0
the other ' leg ' of the @entity1 nuclear force , the @entity95 strategic bombers , will be trimmed from the current deployed total of 93 to 60 , with an additional six available in a non-deployed status			2
the 60 will comprise 19 @entity98 stealth bombers and 41 @entity180 heavy bombers			0
the reductions ensure the @entity1 remains within the @entity21 limit of 700 deployed strategic nuclear weapons with 400 icbms , 240 sub-launched missiles and 60 bombers			2
@entity7 is already is well below the 700 - deployed weapon limit and , at the most recent reporting period last october , had only 473 compared to 809 in @entity1 hands			2
the value of the @entity1 keeping the missiles in storage has been questioned , especially after the @entity8 announced the total cost of the @entity21 changes is estimated at Â£ 300million by 2018			1
in addition to the 450 icbm silos currently in use , the @entity95 has four at @entity31 in @entity32 that are only used for test launches			0
these test silos will remain in place			0
the 2011 @entity21 is an agreement between @entity7 and the @entity1 to reduce their nuclear weapons arsenals			1
it replaced the @entity204 of @entity205 and required both countries to halve its number of nuclear weapons over the 10 years to 2021			0
a clause in the agreement means each country must also have a maximum of 700 deployed missiles and bombers , 1,550 deployed warheads and 800 deployed or non-deployed missile launchers by 2018			0
the @entity21 replaced the @entity204 of @entity205 and required both countries to halve the number of nuclear weapons over the 10 years to 2021 the agreement was controversial from the start , prompting intense public debate during the 2010 @entity1 mid-term elections			1
while arms control experts widely praised the idea of continued nuclear reduction , others accused @entity7 of ' cheating ' on similar past agreements , adding that a further reduction would leave the @entity1 vulnerable to attack			1
2012 @entity1 presidential hopeful @entity229 was among those against the @entity21			0
the allegations of ' cheating ' - which were made the @entity233 @entity234 senator @entity233 during the senatorial debate - caused outrage in the @entity7 media			0
the debate died down somewhat in 2012 when an official @entity8 report into the @entity21 was published			0
the report found that found that even if @entity7 did ' cheat ' on the agreement and attack the @entity1 , the @entity21 would have ' little to no effect ' on @entity1 nuclear retaliatory capabilities .			1

@entity8 says it will keep 450 land - based missiles but put 50 in storage
the launch silos will be kept ' warm ' however , ready to return to service
removal will help @entity1 . comply with the controversial new start treaty
@entity1 - @entity7 agreement was signed in 2011 , aiming to reduce nuclear arms
