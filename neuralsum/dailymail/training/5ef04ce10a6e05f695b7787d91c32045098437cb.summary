increasing numbers of doctors are deserting the @entity3 for a better life in @entity5 and @entity6 , figures reveal			1
the exodus of doctors – who cost the taxpayer up to £ 610,000 to train – is forcing the @entity3 to import staff from southern and eastern @entity12			2
according to a major report from the @entity16 , the number applying for certificates to work abroad has risen by a fifth since 2008 , to nearly 3,000 a year			1
and doctors aged 25 to 27 are most likely to leave – making up one in five of those applying for certificates			2
figures also show that rising numbers of doctors are coming to @entity33 from southern and eastern @entity12 countries such as @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
but experts say the exodus of @entity33 - trained doctors is putting patients at risk by creating too many vacant posts – particularly in @entity44 units and gp surgeries			2
only last week the @entity46 warned that as many as 550 surgeries could close within the next year because doctors nearing retirement wo n’t be replaced			1
staffing shortages are made more problematic by the fact that a growing number of doctors are women , who tend to only work part - time after having children			1
the @entity16 ’s figures show that 44 per cent of doctors are women and they are expected to overtake men by 2017			2
@entity61 , chief executive of the @entity16 , said : ‘ the face of medicine is changing			0
of particular concern are the potential shortages in some specialist areas where there are diminishing numbers of doctors in postgraduate training and large numbers over the age of 50			2
‘ recruitment in some parts of the @entity33 , especially deprived areas and more remote communities , is also a significant challenge			0
’ dr @entity78 , chairman of the @entity46 , said : ‘ the mass exodus of @entity80 – driven by soaring demand and plummeting resources – is a danger to patient safety			0
' on the one hand , gps are leaving the profession due to intense pressure and a lack of support , and on the other , not enough medical students are opting for general practice because they see the pressure we are under			0
’ just over half have applied to work in @entity5 and @entity6 where the demands are less intense and doctors enjoy a better work - life balance figures from the @entity16 show that last year , about 2,900 doctors applied for a ‘ certificate of good standing ’ , which allows them to work abroad , a rise of 22 per cent since 2008			1
some 51 per cent were for @entity5 and @entity6 , while 10 per cent were for @entity105			1
the @entity16 insisted that not all doctors actually left after acquiring the certificate and many only went for a short period			1
last december , dr @entity110 , chairman of the @entity111 which represents @entity44 doctors , warned that the exodus of doctors was a ‘ waste of taxpayers ’ money ’			0
he pointed out that each one has cost the taxpayer £ 610,000 over the ten years of their studying and training			0
however , marginally more doctors are still joining the register than leaving			0
last year , a total of 13,150 joined and 12,231 left – either through retirement , moving abroad or quitting the profession altogether			0
the number arriving from southern and eastern @entity12 has doubled since 2008 to 1,840 last year			1
they represent 14 per cent of those joining the register – about one in seven			0
there are just under 270,000 doctors licensed to practise in the @entity33 .			0

nearly 3,000 doctors a year apply for a certificate to work overseas
@entity5 and @entity6 preferred *destinations* as work is easier there
number of gps arriving from @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 has also increased
