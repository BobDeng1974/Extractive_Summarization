by @entity0 a team of scientists at @entity3 claim hybrid smart tvs that blur the line between televisions and the internet are vulnerable to a simple hack			1
coined the ‘ red - button attack ’ - named after the red button used on modern smart tv remotes to access additional content - the flaw can be exploited with just a $ 250 ( £ 150 ) transmitter			1
in just minutes , someone using a smart tv could find their various internet accounts sending spam , printing coupons and writing fake reviews without their knowledge			1
hackers could , in theory , also use these accounts to harvest personal information			2
dubbed the ' red button attack ' , hackers could hijack broadcasts to access a viewer 's various connected internet accounts , including @entity35 @entity36 and @entity37 from the @entity38 have outlined their research in a paper set to be released later this year			1
the hack is apparently remarkably easy to perform			0
experts in @entity44 recently proved it 's possible to use drones to steal data			0
they modified an aircraft capable of tapping into a phone 's @entity50 settings			0
once it had access , it was able to read and steal personal information			2
called @entity57 , the drone takes advantage of smartphones that actively search for networks			2
from this it can also see networks those devices have accessed in the past			0
during tests , hackers exposed credit card information and passwords			0
according to @entity71 , it would occur while someone is watching tv and would be over in just 12 minutes			0
the attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in @entity76 ( @entity77 )			0
this ‘ allows broadcast streams to include embedded @entity82 content which is rendered by the television , ’ the researchers wrote in their paper			1
‘ this system is already in very wide deployment in @entity87 , and has recently been adopted as part of the @entity90 digital television standard			0
’ the hacker would then , in essence , take over the channel a viewer was watching for a short amount of time			0
this would be done by using a simple amplifier , costing as little as £ 150 ( $ 250 ) on a rooftop to hijack networks across an area of 0.5 square miles ( 1.4 square kilometres )			1
alternatively , a transmitter could also be placed on a drone , which could hover outside the windows of houses to hijack @entity4			1
in doing so , the hacker would have access to any websites the viewer was logged into on their smart tv			1
this could range from getting access to their @entity35 accounts to writing fake reviews on websites for products			1
the attack could be carried out by attaching a small and cheap transmitter to a drone ( stock image shown ) and then hovering outside a victim 's window			2
the attackers could also set up a transmitter on a roof to potentially hijack tens of thousands of tvs across an entire city @entity128 broadcasts can be hijacked because they are not linked to a web server , which also makes attacks virtually untraceable			1
‘ this enables a large - scale exploitation technique with a localised geographical footprint based on radio frequency ( @entity137 ) injection , ’ the researchers continue			1
this ‘ requires a minimal budget and infrastructure and is remarkably difficult to detect			0
’ ‘ in a dense urban area , an attacker with a budget of about $ 450 ( £ 270 ) can target more than 20,000 devices in a single attack			1
’ there are a number of possible solutions			0
the most drastic includes cutting all internet access to smart tvs			1
alternatively , broadcasters could begin to integrate smart tvs into a network that could see if they are being hijacked by monitoring for high spikes in signal strength			1
perhaps the most simple solution , though , would be to have a confirmation box pop - up on screen when a viewer ’s smart tv is trying to open an app such as @entity35			1
this , however , would detract from the current seamless and smooth integration between tv and internet favoured by companies at the moment			2
' this potential attack method is n't related specifically to the use of the red button on a tv remote specifically , but to any interaction with a smart tv , ' says @entity172 , senior security researcher at @entity173 in @entity174			2
' such an attack would effectively be a " man in the middle " attack , with hackers placing themselves between the consumer and the broadcaster and injecting their own , bogus information into the broadcast stream - for example , fake adverts and other content			2
' after hacking the radio signal , hackers " become the broadcaster " and even have the ability to hack into anything sent or received by the consumer			0
' one problem with such an attack is that , since it would involve hacking into the radio signal through the use of an antenna , it would be difficult to track down the attackers			2
' it ’s reminiscent of someone sniffing the traffic on a public @entity201 or setting up a fake one			0
' providers need to ensure they are considering such security implications of new technology			0
' when new technologies emerge , the focus tends to be on the positive benefits - how the technology will make people 's lives easier - not enough focus is placed on the risks inherent in the use of the latest technology			0
' @entity216 , garage doors , car entertainment systems and electricity meters are all examples of new technology that all benefit from internet connectivity , but the extension of technology in this way also brings the possibility of more cyber-attacks			0

researchers at @entity3 claim smart @entity4 can be hacked
so - called hybrid tvs can be hijacked using a $ 250 ( £ 150 ) 1 - watt transmitter
the scientists are set to *discuss* the exploit in a paper later this year
they claim attackers could get access to viewers ' internet accounts
they could then post on @entity35 , write fake reviews , and much more
