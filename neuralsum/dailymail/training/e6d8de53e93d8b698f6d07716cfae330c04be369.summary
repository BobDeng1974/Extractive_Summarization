by @entity0 and @entity1 parents are being fined £ 60 if their children are a few minutes late for school in a tough new crackdown on discipline			1
two headteachers in the same local authority are believed to be the first to take the action in an attempt to slash truancy rates			1
the parents of a persistent offender face a £ 60 fixed penalty – which can be doubled if they fail to pay within 21 days			1
fine mess : the headteacher at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , has warned parents they will face fines of £ 60 if their children are late headteachers have been able to impose financial penalties on the parents of regular truants since 2003 , but @entity26 has said schools can classify children as skipping school even if they arrive late			1
two schools have adopted the policy , including @entity17 , which was rated inadequate by @entity33 inspectors last year			1
it has issued parents with a warning that they will be fined if a child misses registration ten times in a 12 - week term			1
the school said : ‘ the link between good attendance and pupils achieving well at school is clear			0
‘ during the recent @entity33 monitoring inspection it was noted that “ strategies to improve attendance and punctuality have resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of pupils who come to school on time ”			0
‘ at the end of the autumn term 2013 , 353 pupils at @entity17 received certificates for 100 per cent punctuality			2
this is a big improvement on previous years and has been achieved through working with our families			0
’ school fine : parents at the school in @entity18 will have the fine doubled if they do n't pay it promptly ( file picture ) but the policy has infuriated some parents			1
@entity71 , 40 , said : ‘ there needs to be a deterrent but i think it puts lots of pressure on parents and does break the commitment between the school and families			2
‘ if you have got , like we have , children in different schools , you are trying to navigate logistics from one to the other and there are always going to be some problems			1
’ but another parent , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ kids arriving late cause disruption and this has made parents sit up and take notice			2
’ education experts welcomed the policy , but said it had to be used in the right circumstances			2
@entity98 , of the @entity99 , said : ‘ if the lateness is wilful and persistent and the school decides there is no other way forward , then it is justified			0
‘ but they have to be careful because it can lead to the breakdown of the relationship between the school and parents			2
‘ there is also the question of whether social services should be involved to see what is going on at home			0
schools should n’t act in isolation on this			0
’ other local authorities are understood to be considering adopting the system to curb the tide of lateness and truancy			0
schools were originally able to impose a £ 50 penalty but this was increased to £ 60 in september 2012 as part of education secretary @entity128 ’s attempt to restore discipline to schools			1
the increase came as record numbers of parents were given criminal records for allowing children to skip lessons			1
some 10,185 parents were found guilty and sentenced in 2012 – a 3.5 per cent rise on the 9,836 the previous year			0
in 2001 , just 1,845 people were convicted			0
a spokesman for @entity26 said : ‘ our figures show that in the last academic year , two fixed penalty fines were issued in relation to persistent late attendance by pupils			0
in a majority of cases , a warning letter has proved to be enough to stop the issue			0

parents will be fined if their children miss registration 10 times in a term
education *campaigners* said fines are a ' step too far '
schools in @entity18 are believed to be the first in @entity162 to fine parents
