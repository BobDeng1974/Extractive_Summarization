many people may feel that they have spent a great deal of time on the @entity4 road , which connects @entity5 and @entity6			0
but the route has been in use for a staggering 10,000 years , according to newly - discovered archaeological evidence			2
a @entity11 settlement , which has been compared to a modern - day service station , has been unearthed by researchers alongside the @entity4 near @entity14 in @entity15			1
experts have discovered ancient artefacts during the widening of the road through @entity15 ( pictured ) a @entity11 settlement has been uncovered beside the @entity4 in @entity15			1
the site is believed to have been a kind of overnight shelter used by people travelling north and south thousands of years ago			1
a number of flint tools dating back to between 6000 and 8000 @entity30 were also discovered at the site			1
evidence of @entity33 , @entity11 and @entity35 settlements have been found near the @entity37 town of @entity38 , near the @entity39			1
the team has discovered buildings on the edge of @entity43 - a roman road running alongside the @entity4 - including shop frontages and even a bath house			2
finds during the excavations have included a complete @entity37 bowl called a @entity50 used for grinding herbs and spices			0
roman glass from a drinking vessel has also been found at the site of the @entity37 town			1
approximately half a mile further south from @entity38 , is evidence of @entity33 settlements and @entity33 cremations			1
this means the route predates previous estimates that claimed it was built by the @entity37			1
the site is believed to have been a kind of overnight shelter , used by people travelling north and south thousands of years ago			1
a number of flint tools dating back to between 6000 and 8000 @entity30 were also discovered at the site			1
@entity71 , @entity72 for the project , said : ‘ this was a place that these people knew of - a place they could return to on many occasions , to stay sheltered overnight during their travels			0
‘ it is telling us there is evidence for people using the route and moving through the area over periods of time			0
‘ it is also adding to our knowledge of the early @entity11 period , a time we do n't know very much about and this is very interesting			0

evidence of @entity33 , @entity11 and @entity35 settlements have previously been found near the @entity37 town of @entity38 , near the @entity39 not far from this location ‘ we found a small structure which resembled a type of shelter where they were making the flint tools that were also present at the site			1
’ this rare find was uncovered during the excavation of known @entity37 settlements in advance of plans to upgrade the @entity4 to motorway status between @entity118 51 and 56			2
@entity119 , principal inspector of ancient monuments for @entity121 in @entity15 , said : ' i think this is really tantalising			0
this discovery gives us an even greater understanding of the time depth and movement through this landscape			0
the discovery was made along a stretch of the @entity4 close to @entity14 in @entity15 ( marked )			2
it was uncovered during excavation of known @entity37 settlements in advance of plans to upgrade the @entity4 to motorway status between @entity118 51 and 56 ‘ can we ask questions about route ways that predate the @entity37 period ? ’ he asked			1
the @entity4 is the longest numbered road in the country and is under an almost constant state of upgrade			0
archaeologists have been excavating ancient monuments between @entity146 and @entity147 , where construction work will begin to widen the road			0
finds during the excavations at @entity38 include a complete @entity37 bowl called a @entity154 ( pictured ) which was used for grinding herbs and spices archaeologists were surprised to find the ancient ' service station ' ( pictured left ) which provided shelter for travellers heading north and south 10,000 years ago			1
a @entity162 brooch ( pictured right ) was also unearthed at the site			0
archaeologists are busy trying to find treasures before the widening of the @entity4 goes ahead roman glass from a drinking vessel , was also uncovered near @entity38			0
finds preceding the glass by thousands of years were additionally discovered nearby @entity43 , which was built by the @entity37 , runs alongside the modern @entity4 and the experts are focusing their efforts on a @entity37 town located by the road near to the @entity39 , called @entity175			1
they have so far discovered evidence of @entity33 , @entity11 and @entity35 settlements			2
@entity71 said : ‘ the road scheme is 12 miles ( 19km ) long and we are investigating a number of different sites			0
‘ it was fascinating to find that one of those was in fact a @entity11 site , a further 8,000 years into the past , beyond the @entity37			2
‘ we are still finding extremely clear evidence of how people used to live here almost 2,000 years ago during the @entity37 period			2
’ the team has discovered buildings on the edge of @entity43 , including shop frontages and even a bath house			0
this flint tool , which dates between 6000 and 8000 @entity30 was also discovered at the site close to the busy a road ‘ we think this was a particularly industrial part of the town , ’ he said			1
‘ finds during the excavations have included a complete @entity37 bowl called a @entity154 used for grinding herbs and spices			0
another was @entity37 glass from a drinking vessel , found in @entity38			0
’ approximately half a mile ) 0.8km ) further south from @entity38 , is evidence of @entity33 settlements and @entity33 cremations			2
@entity119 added : ‘ this is really interesting because we were n't quite expecting to find @entity33 material here either			0
‘ in pre-work , we have done quite a lot of studying at desktop level to try to understand what the level of archaeology of the landscape was actually like			0
‘ to find an @entity33 settlement with @entity33 activity and even cremations gives us an inkling again as to what life was like before the @entity37 period			2

@entity11 settlement was unearthed near @entity14 in @entity15
site beside the @entity4 was used as an overnight shelter 10,000 years ago
this means the route predates previous estimates it was built by @entity37
flint tools dating back to between 6000 and 8000 @entity30 were found at the site
the dig took place at known @entity37 settlements before the widening of a section of the road takes place
@entity43 runs alongside the modern @entity4 and the experts are focusing on a @entity37 town where they have found *fragments* of glass and a bowl
@entity175 is evidence of @entity33 settlements and cremations
