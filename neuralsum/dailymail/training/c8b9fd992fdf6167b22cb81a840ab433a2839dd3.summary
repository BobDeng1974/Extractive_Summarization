a woman broke down in tears in a @entity3 court after being found not guilty in her father - in - law 's murder trial in what prosecutors claimed was a drug - related robbery gone wrong			1
@entity9 was suspected of killing @entity10 , her husband 's father and the former mayor of their town of @entity15 , @entity3 who she lived with at the time of his death			1
in the trial , witnesses described the acrimonious relationship between the two and said that the 72 - year - old would lock his bedroom at night so that he would n't be robbed in his sleep			1
' i would never hurt him , ' @entity9 said during her time on the stand			2
overjoyed : @entity9 , 32 , was found not guilty of murdering her father - in - law emotional : @entity10 , 32 , is not done with her legal drama as a mistrial has been filed regarding her charge of conspiracy ( seen here on wednesday ) the @entity10 family has faced some problems in the past as a result of the mayor 's son 's drug addiction , which @entity43 opened up about in an interview with @entity45 just months before his death			1
in the article , he revealed that @entity9 , @entity43 's son @entity48 and their then - 11 - year - old son lived in a spare room in the mayor 's house and he made the decision to lock his door at night because @entity48 had previously stolen money to buy prescription pills			1
helping : mayor @entity10 had his drug addict son and his wife and child living with him in his home at the time that he was found dead ' i hate living like this			1
i hate being an addict , but i ca n't shake it , ' @entity48 told the interviewer			2
@entity48 went to rehab four times at different programs			2
his name was never mentioned during the trial and is currently in prison on an unrelated charge			2
local station @entity73 reports that the 32 - year - old woman was found not guilty of first degree murder , but the case does not close there as the judge declared a mistrial in the conspiracy charge against her			1
her brother , @entity82 , is suspected of being involved with the mayor 's death and will be tried for first degree murder as well but not until next year			1
a lack of evidence undoubtedly helped ms @entity9 's case , as she claimed she was out of town on the night of her father - in - law 's murder			1
the prosecution had nothing to prove her claim false			0
' the only person that had access to his bedroom because unbeknownst to him she had gotten the key is the defendant , @entity102 , ' county prosecutor @entity95 said in the trial			0
their would - be smoking gun came from the discovery of a plastic bag in the elderly man 's bedroom which the prosecutor claims the alleged suspects used to suffocate him			0
the mayor 's cause of death has not been reported			2
@entity9 's defense attorney said that the fact that the bag was in the room should be used as a point in her favor , not against her			2
suspects : @entity9 ( left ) has now been found not guilty of murder but her brother @entity82 ( right ) faces his own trial for the same charge in january remote : @entity15 , @entity3 only has 862 residents and the surrounding area is one of the areas in the country hardest - hit by prescription drug abuse ' why 'd they leave the bag behind ? ' lawyer @entity131 said			1
' the one item that is supposed to have smothered and killed @entity43 ... they leave it behind			0
' the small town of @entity15 , made up of only 862 people and located in the southern part of the state by the @entity3 and @entity142 borders , was rocked by mr @entity10 's death			1
though @entity9 , who is known in the area as @entity102 , has been cleared of the murder charge , commentors on the case see it as a judicial mistake			1
' what a shame ! this is not justice			0
what is wrong with the state 's prosecution ? ' wrote one unidentified reader of the local @entity158 affiliate			0
' this should have been an open and shut case - guilty			0
it is no secret that she wished @entity43 to die			0
how many times did @entity102 instigate arguments with him ? she often referred to @entity43 as " old hateful " or " walking death			0
" unusual circumstances : @entity9 , her 11 - year - old son and husband were all living in her father - in - law 's house because of her husband @entity48 's drug addiction ' @entity43 tried to give @entity102 a chance at a decent life and the opportunity to be a mother to her son as well as a home to live in			1
instead , @entity102 chose to throw all that away for a life of drugs and thievery			0
she was an ungrateful , narcissistic virago towards @entity43			0
' another commentor who used the username of ' candice ' suggested the 12 - person jury was prejudicial			0
' this trial should have been moved out of the state , for a fair trial to have been given , ' the person wrote			0
' even without all of the overwhelming evidence against her , there are so many testimonies against her , that should have been enough alone to convict her ! '			0

@entity9 , 32 , was accused of killing her father - in - law
@entity10 , 72 , had been the mayor of @entity15 , @entity3 for a decade before his july 2012 death . his cause of death has not been reported
@entity9 , her husband @entity48 and their 11 - year - old son were living with the mayor because @entity48 had a drug addiction and was *unemployed*
prosecutors allege that @entity9 and her brother *plotted* to steal money from the mayor and kill him
she is now *innocent* of the murder but her conspiracy charge has not been settled as it was ruled a mistrial
her brother will face the court in january
prescription drug *overdoses* are common in the area and the mayor kept his door locked at night because his son stole from him for drug money
