repairing a road sign should be a simple enough job			2
but not for one council – which says it has to consult with 22 organisations before it can even begin to put it back up			1
as a result , the sign has remained hidden in the undergrowth by the side of the road for more than two years			1
@entity10 had to consult 22 bodies before starting repair work on a damaged sign just outside the village or @entity15 , in @entity15 local mps have been campaigning on behalf of the residents of @entity15 in @entity18 to have it fixed			1
but @entity10 said it had a statutory duty to consult with nearly two dozen bodies before reinstating the sign , which marks a junction leading to the village of @entity24 on the @entity25			1
among the 22 organisations being consulted over wires and pipes are @entity29 , @entity30 , the @entity31 and @entity32			2
the situation was described as ‘ barmy ’ by the leader of the @entity35 , @entity34 last month			1
asked about the issue by @entity37 , @entity37 mp for @entity38 , he replied : ‘ it does sound fairly barmy if they have to consult so many people			1
’ mrs @entity37 , who brought up the problem in the @entity35 , said : ‘ there has to be a quicker way			0
’ @entity35 leader @entity34 ( left ) called the situation ' barmy ' after @entity37 , @entity37 mp for @entity38 , raised the issue but @entity10 said fixing the sign was not a top priority			1
‘ we have a legal obligation to gather relevant information before we carry out work , ’ a spokesman said			1
he added : ‘ we agree with @entity34			1
it does sound barmy , but it ’s what councils have to do			2
‘ that ’s not the issue here			0
we ’re not waiting to hear back from anyone , it ’s just a case of priorities			0
’ he went on : ‘ this is n’t a sign that has any road safety benefit so it has to wait while we do things that we have to consider higher priority			2
‘ we ’ve not been made aware that this is causing a problem and it ’s somewhat surprising that it ’s a subject that has been discussed in the @entity35			0
’ however , the council could avoid having to repair the sign at all – as from next year , excessive speed limit signs and other ‘ unnecessary clutter ’ will be removed from @entity75 roads in the biggest shake - up of traffic signage since the 1960s			2
new guidelines to be issued to councils will end the need for road signs that repeatedly remind drivers of speed limits			0
ministers were ‘ alarmed ’ to learn that the number of road signs had doubled from two million in 1993 to more than 4.6 million today			0
@entity88 , the @entity90 ’s head of roads policy , said : ‘ road signs are placed to warn , inform , regulate and direct drivers but they have multiplied almost uncontrollably over the last few decades			0
’ he added : ‘ getting the balance right will be difficult – sign clutter is a problem but we should not cut back on signs that stop drivers speeding or parking badly			0
’ the road sign debacle is not the first time this year that @entity18 council has come under criticism			1
in august it emerged that it was home to @entity75 ’s biggest earning council boss , who reportedly earned £ 318,500 a year for a four - day week			0
@entity107 , who is no longer employed by the council , was also said to have channelled his income as director of children ’s services in a way that potentially allowed him to avoid paying tens of thousands in income tax and national insurance .			0
