' the email was obtained by @entity48 , and written by the former employee just one day after she was terminated from the company			2
' i have worked for executives at @entity3 for approximately 7 years , the last 5 + of which have been in @entity53 assisting @entity37 , ' the email begins			1
' my experience in the @entity53 department has been marred by disparate and unfair treatment in promotion and hiring practices , harassment , retaliation , bullying women , name - calling , offensive language , threats , blocking my advancement and transfers , withholding information to paint a negative opinion , maligning , unsolicited hugs and invitations , resulting in sexual harassment and drinking during work hours in the office			2
' from there , the writer lists some specific incidents of harassment and abuse , as well as what she deems to be racist practices			2
' so the situation is a @entity21 person promoted twice above the more experienced , more senior @entity13 - @entity13 person and the @entity13 has yet to get the title for the job that she actually does , ' writes the former employee			1
' my case is n't isolated , my @entity13 tub mate , works for the same @entity92 , now @entity93 , who promoted @entity94 in 18 months , has not given her , the @entity13 - @entity13 assistant the classification for the job she is doing â€” admin iii. the only other @entity13 in our department in the last 10 years , was @entity101 , who was laid - off in 2009 , after 10 years as a manager			1
i asked to take over some of his duties and learn more and was rebuffed ; another @entity21 was hired 5 months later			0
' as for @entity14 's behavior , she writes ; ' in january 2009 , @entity14 harassed me by yelling at me , charging at my desk for dial - in instructions , after providing them , i hastened out and he chased , blocked my exit and threatened me not to take overtime , in front of several witnesses			1
this anger was in retaliation for my having reported him to the @entity117 3 weeks earlier , when he called me " [ @entity122 ] useless , " and slammed his computer down for emphasis in front of a female vp			0
' buds : @entity14 ( right , with @entity27 and actor @entity124 ) denied most of the woman 's allegations bad timing : this comes just days after a racist email exchange between @entity130 and producer @entity131 about president @entity132 was leaked the writer shares a few more incidents similar in nature , with profane rants and the slamming of things			1
as for the sexual harassment , she says @entity14 invited her to spend time alone in his office on multiple occasions ' the beginnings of the sexual abuse occurred in 2007 when he asked me to join him while he serenaded @entity145 and operations managers in his dimmed office ' she says			2
' i refused him twice saying that i had an abundance of work to complete			0
the final time that he asked , he offered me , " @entity155 with @entity145 , i told him in no uncertain terms , " i do n't drink			0
" he yelled slapping at me , " then , you 're not on my team ! " ' initially , it seemed like a joke , later it became apparent with the comments , like i 'm imperious and then he began calling me a " bitch " in many incarnations and that became de rigueur in the office			0
' the email closes by saying , ' i need someone to protect me from @entity14			2
' this leaked email comes just days after one in which @entity3 chair @entity30 and producer @entity131 made racist remarks about president @entity132			1
on the eve of a fundraising breakfast in november 2013 being attended by the president at the home of @entity177 ceo @entity176 , @entity130 and @entity131 went over things she could discuss with @entity132 while at the event			2
' should i ask him if he liked @entity182 ? ' @entity130 asks @entity131 , a reference to the 2012 @entity185 film @entity186 that dealt with the subject of slavery in the @entity189			0
' 12 years , ' responds @entity131 , referencing another slavery film , this time @entity193 's 2013 @entity192 - winning work @entity194 , a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in @entity199			1
the pair then keep going , listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name , including @entity203 and two @entity205 movies , @entity206			0
' i bet he likes @entity205 , ' says @entity131 at one point			0
not having it : @entity210 called out @entity130 and @entity131 on @entity211 african - american television giant @entity210 said of the emails on @entity211 , ' calling @entity3 comments " racially insensitive remarks " instead of ' racist ' ? ' she tweeted			1
' u can put a cherry on a pile of s * * * but it do n't make it a sundae			0
' @entity130 , who says she is not racist , issued an apology on thursday , saying ; ' the content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who i am			0
