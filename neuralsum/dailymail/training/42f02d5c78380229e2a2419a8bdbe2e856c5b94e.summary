by @entity0 and @entity1 workers are preparing to enter one of the most dangerous rooms on the @entity5 - the site of a 1976 blast that exposed a technician to a massive dose of radiation , which led to him being nicknamed the ' @entity10			1
' @entity11 , then 64 , was working in the room when a chemical reaction caused a glass glove box to explode			1
he was exposed to the highest dose of radiation from the chemical element americium ever recorded — 500 times the occupational standard			1
@entity5 , located in central @entity19 , made plutonium for nuclear weapons for decades			2
the room was used to recover radioactive americium , a byproduct of plutonium			2
atomic man : @entity11 survived a nuclear explosion in 1976 at the @entity5 in @entity27 , @entity19 nukes : the @entity5 made plutonium for nuclear weapons for decades			1
covered with blood , @entity11 was dragged from the room and put into an ambulance headed for the decontamination center			2
because he was too hot to handle , he was removed by remote control and transported to a steel - and - concrete isolation tank			0
during the next five months , doctors laboriously extracted tiny bits of glass and razor - sharp pieces of metal embedded in his skin			2
nurses scrubbed him down three times a day and shaved every inch of his body every day			2
the radioactive bathwater and thousands of towels became nuclear waste			0
@entity11 also received some 600 shots of @entity51 , an experimental drug that helped him excrete the radioactive material			1
outcast : @entity11 's friends were afraid to go near him until his minister assured them that it was safe to be around him he was placed in isolation in a decontamination facility for five months			1
within a year , his body 's radiation count had fallen by about 80 percent and he was allowed to return home			1
but his radiation - related medical problems proliferated			0
he had a kidney infection , four heart attacks in as many months and cataract surgery on both eyes , followed by a cornea transplant and a precipitous drop in his blood platelet count , which required transfusions			0
friends at first avoided him until his minister told people it was safe to be around him			2
the accident sapped his stamina , and he was unable to hunt , fish or do any of the things he had planned for his retirement			0
he was studied extensively by doctors for the rest of his life and died of coronary artery disease in 1987 at the age of 75			0
restricted : the ' @entity84 ' was used to recover radioactive americium , a byproduct of plutonium @entity5 contains the nation 's greatest collection of nuclear waste , and for more than two decades has been engaged in the dangerous work of cleaning up that waste			1
the space now dubbed the @entity94 is located inside the closed @entity95 and is scheduled for cleanup this summer			0
' it 's been largely closed up since the accident , ' @entity97 , a spokesman for the @entity99 @entity98 in @entity27 , said wednesday			0
' it was restricted for the potential for airborne radiation contamination			0
' since 2008 , the @entity98 and contractor @entity105 have been preparing the plant for demolition			1
' about two - thirds of the @entity95 is deactivated — cleaned out and ready for demolition , ' said @entity110 , an assistant @entity98 manager in @entity27			1
' cleaning out the @entity84 will be a major step forward			0
' @entity113 : the @entity98 hopes to have the site ready for demolition by summer of 2016 when specially trained and equipped workers enter the room this summer , they will encounter airborne radioactivity , surface contamination , confined spaces and poor ventilation , the @entity98 said			1
they will be wearing abrasion - resistant suits that protect them from surface contamination and chemicals			0
a dual - purpose air system will provide cool air for breathing and cool air throughout the suit for worker comfort , allowing them to work for longer periods of time			0
the suits are pressurized , to prevent workers from coming into contact with airborne contaminants			0
the @entity84 ' is going to be the toughest work ahead of us as we finish cleaning the plant and getting it ready for demolition by the end of september 2016 , ' @entity97 said .			1

@entity11 was working at the @entity5 when a chemical reaction caused a glass glove box to explode .
he was exposed to the highest dose of radiation from the chemical element americium ever recorded — 500 times the occupational standard
it took more than a year for doctors to remove enough radioactive material from his body to make it safe for him to be around other people
the @entity98 hopes to have the facility ready for demolition by summer 2016
