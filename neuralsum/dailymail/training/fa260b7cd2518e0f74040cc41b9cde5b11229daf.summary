@entity0 will decide who he will axe from @entity4 's @entity3 squad to make way for new man @entity6 on tuesday			1
up until recently it was assumed that stand in right back @entity7 would be the automatic choice to drop out as the club submit their 21 - man squad to @entity14			1
but a sterling performance in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity17 has improved the @entity19 's chances of dodging a bullet			0
@entity0 must decide who will drop out of his @entity4 squad to accommodate @entity6 @entity4 right back @entity7 is among the possible candidates who could lose his @entity25 spot @entity4 have had their 2014 - 15 @entity3 squad cut from 25 players to 21 after breaching financial fair play rules attention has now shifted to fringe strike pair @entity30 and @entity32			1
in recent times @entity33 international @entity30 has had more game time than the big @entity35 , who was linked with a Â£ 12million deadline day switch to @entity39 which failed to materialise			2
none of @entity4 's four ' homegrown ' players , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 or @entity45 will be considered along with ' club - trained ' @entity47 defender @entity46 as the @entity49 side have to meet their quota			2
@entity32 has struggled this season and is unlikely to be amused with a lack of playing time			0
other options for @entity0 include dropping stand - in goalkeeper @entity55 although that is unlikely			0
if @entity7 was to miss out , @entity43 could fill in as a back - up to @entity58			0
outsiders for the chop include @entity61 and @entity62 but both are considered unlikely options along with the prospect of leaving @entity6 out himself as he finds his feet following his move from @entity69			0
@entity30 or @entity32 are now the front - runners to lose their spot to new @entity4 team - mate @entity6			1

@entity0 is to make *decision* on final @entity3 squad
@entity7 was thought to be the leading *contender* to lose spot
however attention has now shifted to @entity30 and @entity32
