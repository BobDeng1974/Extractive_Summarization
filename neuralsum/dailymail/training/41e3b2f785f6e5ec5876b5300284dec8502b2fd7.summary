at first @entity20 lied that his wife was at a friend ’s house , but eventually admitted : ‘ it ’s @entity3			1

they lived in @entity38 , @entity39 , in a bungalow @entity20 had built himself			0
the retired joiner , who was later diagnosed as being in the early stages of dementia , looked confused yesterday as a judge said his crime was so serious he had no choice but to send him to prison , despite his age			0
home : the killing took place at the @entity54 ' bungalow in @entity38 , @entity39 in september last year ‘ it is a tragedy to see you here at your age and that your wife of so many years is dead at your hands , ’ judge @entity55 told him			1
‘ this was a brutal attack on a vulnerable old lady of nearly 83 years			2
’ @entity1 , 79 , was obsessed with money , even though he had tens of thousands of pounds in savings the couple used be ‘ well turned out ’ and keep their home spotless , @entity67 was told			1
in recent years , however , they had been in declining health and struggled to look after themselves			2
mrs @entity20 had sciatica and needed help getting about , but her husband had shown little sympathy , neighbours later told police			0
mrs @entity20 had also been seen with bruises , apparently inflicted by her husband , but police had not been informed and the ‘ proud ’ couple had rejected help from social services			0
@entity83 , prosecuting , said @entity20 ’s concern about the heating was part of an obsession with saving money			0

mr @entity108 said the killing would otherwise have been ‘ a grave case of murder , involving the killing of an 82 - year - old woman by protracted , substantial violence ’			2
he added : ‘ she must have known it was her husband inflicting the injuries on her and it was plain death was far from instantaneous			0
’ last night mrs @entity20 ’s cousin , @entity119 , said : ‘ @entity3 was a very kind and devoted wife and certainly did n’t deserve to end her life in this cruel and tragic way			1
