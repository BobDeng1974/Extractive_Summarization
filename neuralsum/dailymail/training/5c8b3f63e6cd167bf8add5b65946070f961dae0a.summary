by @entity0 last updated at 1:49 am on 12th january 2012 a new drug which can give men with advanced prostate cancer an extra three months of life has been rejected for use on the @entity6			1
@entity7 increases survival for men who had already tried a range of other therapies			1
each year around 35,000 men in the @entity13 are diagnosed with prostate cancer , with around 10,000 having locally advanced disease who might be eligible for the drug			1
but the @entity6 rationing body , the @entity19 , says it is not value for money despite admitting it works			0

a new drug prolonging life for prostate cancer sufferers has been rejected by the @entity6 rationing body in draft guidance issued today @entity19 says the drug is not cost - effective , even though it was fast - tracked in the @entity31 as a ‘ last chance ’ treatment for prostate cancer sufferers			1
the drug made by @entity36 costs around £ 22,000 for a one - off course of treatment			0
the @entity39 said men in @entity41 would have to apply to the @entity42 in a bid to get it , but the option was not open to men in @entity46 which does not have a similar fund			2
@entity48 , chief executive of @entity49 , said ‘ this decision is a huge blow to men living with the very advanced stages of prostate cancer who currently have very limited treatment options open to them			1
‘ @entity7 is one of only two licensed drugs available in the @entity13 that offers the hope of precious extra time to men living with advanced prostate cancer			1
‘ @entity19 ’s decision not to recommend this drug means that men in @entity41 and @entity46 with advanced prostate cancer will find it much harder to access it through the @entity6			1
‘ we are very concerned that this will lead to a postcode lottery and mean some men will not be able to get cabazitaxel in time for it to benefit them			2
“ it is essential that men who have been prescribed this drug because their doctors think it will benefit them can still access it on the @entity6			0
‘ we hope that a review of @entity19 ’s recommendation will take place as soon as the drug manufacturers are able to provide more information about the difference this drug can make to the quality of life of men with advanced prostate cancer			1
’ results from a clinical trial of 755 men from 26 countries found the drug had benefits in patients whose cancer continued to progress despite the use of the current final option , the chemotherapy drug @entity97			1
men whose cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland are usually treated with drugs that reduce the body ’s production of testosterone , a hormone that can feed cancer growth			1
when such therapy fails , @entity97 is used but this often fails as well			0
the trial showed the overall survival of men taking cabazitaxel was 15.1 months compared with 12.7 months for men taking the drug mitoxantrone , used to promote quality of life			2
other information considered by @entity19 concluded men gained an average of three months ’ extra life			0
@entity48 , from the @entity39 , said the news is a ' huge blow ' for those in the advanced stage of the disease the @entity31 drugs watchdog , the @entity125 , considered cabazitaxel , also known as @entity7 , under its priority review programme for drugs that may offer a major advance in treatment and approved it in 2010			1
sir @entity131 , chief executive of @entity19 said ‘ although cabazitaxel has been shown to be effective in extending life , it is also associated with a number of side effects			0
‘ once these factors had been taken into account , the independent committee appraising this drug concluded that it would not provide enough health benefit to justify its cost , which means it would not be a cost effective use of limited @entity6 resources			0
‘ the draft guidance on cabazitaxel is now with consultees , who have the opportunity to appeal against it			0
until @entity19 issues final guidance , @entity6 bodies should make decisions locally on the funding of specific treatments			0
‘ this draft guidance does not mean that people currently taking cabazitaxel will stop receiving it			0
they have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop			0
’ dr @entity160 , oncology medical manager of @entity36 , said ‘ we are disappointed that @entity19 has not recommended the use of @entity7 on the basis of cost			2
it offers an important new treatment option with significant clinical benefit			0
‘ there is significant clinical need within the @entity6 for @entity7 – with around 100 patients having been prescribed the drug through the @entity42			2
