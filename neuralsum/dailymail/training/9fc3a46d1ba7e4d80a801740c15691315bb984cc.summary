@entity0 have handed a trial to young @entity2 forward @entity3			1
the 20 - year - old @entity4 international is currently out of contract at the @entity7 and keen to move on			1
he has been training with the @entity10 youth squad in @entity11 as the @entity13 champions weigh up a move amid rival interest from @entity16 and @entity17			1
most wanted : @entity2 's @entity3 has attracted the likes of @entity0 , @entity16 and @entity17 should @entity0 decide to press ahead , @entity3 would not require a work permit as he holds a @entity21 passport			1
meanwhile , @entity22 may have returned to @entity0 a married man after a lavish summer wedding , but all his attention is now focused on striving towards a different kind of happy union			1
the @entity28 is the object of his desire			1
for @entity22 , returning to @entity33 football ’s greatest stage would provide the chance to expunge some painful memories from his debut season at @entity10			2
he made three appearances in the group stage last term , all of which brought varying shades of anguish			2
little more than 60 seconds of a 2 - 0 defeat in @entity45 was followed by a late introduction against @entity47 at @entity10			2
that , however , lasted just 11 minutes before a clattering challenge on @entity50 earned @entity22 a red card and the wrath of manager @entity53			0
@entity54 : @entity55 wants to taste success in the @entity28 after last season 's disappointment he was free of suspension in time to start the final game against @entity61 , only for that to morph into another nightmare as @entity0 were routed 6 - 1			1
this was n’t quite how the @entity65 imagined it working out after moving from @entity67 last august			0
the 22 - year - old midfielder ’s season was then curtailed by a torn groin muscle sustained on international duty but he is back under new boss @entity72 determined to make a more substantial mark			1
helping the club qualify for the @entity28 is key , with the first qualifier against @entity76 now just a fortnight away			1
‘ the @entity28 is so important to a club like @entity0 , ’ @entity22 admitted			1
‘ we want to get to the group stage and , although it will be tough , i believe we can do it			0
‘ last year , the @entity28 was not so good for me but i have tried to learn from the red card against @entity47			1
i was a split second late for the ball and paid the price - but next time , hopefully , i will do it differently			2
‘ sometimes these things can make you stronger , because after the red card i was extremely down			0
@entity90 retreat : @entity22 and @entity0 team - mate @entity91 ( right ) take part in pre-season training in @entity94 ‘ my first few months at @entity0 were a shock for me but experiences like that can only make you a better player			1
‘ it was difficult at first			0
i did n’t start the season that well			2
i was at a new club , with new team - mates and a new coach			2
' i did n’t know about the expectations of the club and the football was so different to what i was used to in @entity65			0
it took me some time but eventually i settled down and started to play better before my injury			0
‘ football is all about confidence and you need to start to believe you can perform			0
i feel good now about myself , the team and the coach			0
’ the positivity extends to @entity22 ’s personal life after his marriage to wife @entity120 during the close season			2
the big day was happily concluded , despite some pre-match jitters			0
‘ it was the best day of my life , ’ he grinned			0
‘ it was a great party at night with about 600 guests			0
hitched : @entity55 returns to @entity0 training after a summer wedding in @entity65 ‘ we celebrate weddings differently in @entity65 and i was probably more nervous before that than i would be before a big game			1
but , once i had a few drinks , i was ok			0
‘ it was a great occasion but i did n’t have time for a honeymoon because i was injured last year and wanted to get back fit for pre-season with the new manager and staff at @entity0			1
‘ everyone wants to prove themselves to the new coach			0
@entity53 ( @entity145 ) has left and it ’s a fresh start for all of us			0
‘ the atmosphere has been great so far and we are looking forward to the new season			2

@entity0 have offered a trial to @entity4 international @entity152
20 - year - old is currently at @entity2 but is keen to leave @entity7
@entity16 and @entity17 are also *reported* to be interested
@entity0 's @entity55 returns to pre-season training determined to taste success in @entity28 after last season 's disappointments
