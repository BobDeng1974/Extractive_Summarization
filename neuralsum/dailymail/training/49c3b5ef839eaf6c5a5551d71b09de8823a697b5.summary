scientists could be closer to finding water on the moon - a discovery that could help create rocket fuel and breathable air for future colonies			1
using data from the @entity12 's @entity11 tool , @entity8 scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon craggy deposits			1
and they 've found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area ; the slopes of craters in the moon 's southern hemisphere facing the @entity22			1
@entity8 scientists have found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area ; the slopes of craters in the moon 's southern hemisphere facing the @entity22			1
pictured is a @entity12 mage of the moon 's @entity28 , located just northeast of @entity30 these slopes could be mankind 's best hope finding drinkable water on the lunar surface , they claim			1
@entity37 could be found as either hydroxol - which is a single atom bound with a single oxygen atom — or it may be two hydrogen atoms bound with oxygen			2
scientists believe lunar water could be used for drinking or its components – hydrogen and oxygen – may be used to manufacture rocket fuel or even breathable air			1
' there 's an average of about 23 parts - per - million - by - weight ( ppmw ) more hydrogen on @entity55 ( @entity56 ) than on @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , ' said @entity8 scientist , @entity59			0
this is the first time a widespread difference in the spread of hydrogen on the moon has been detected			2
using data from the @entity12 's @entity66 ( artist 's impression pictured ) , @entity8 scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon 's surface the cause of the discrepancy between @entity56 and @entity58 may be similar to how the sun move or redistributes frozen water from warmer to colder places on the surface of the @entity77			1
there are different possible sources for the hydrogen on the moon			0
comets and some asteroids contain large amounts of water , and impacts by these objects may bring hydrogen to the moon			1
hydrogen - bearing molecules could also be created on the lunar surface by interaction with the solar wind			0
the solar wind is a thin stream of gas that 's constantly blown off the sun. most of it is hydrogen , and this hydrogen may interact with oxygen in silicate rock and dust on the moon to form hydroxyl and possibly water molecules			1
after these molecules arrive at the moon , it is thought they get energized by sunlight and then bounce across the lunar surface ; and they get stuck , at least temporarily , in colder and more shadowy areas			0
' here in the northern hemisphere , if you go outside on a sunny day after a snowfall , you 'll notice that there 's more snow on north - facing slopes because they lose water at slower rates than the more sunlit south - facing slopes ' said @entity59			2
' we think a similar phenomenon is happening with the volatiles on the moon – pfs do n't get as much sunlight as @entity58 , so this easily vapourised material stays longer and possibly accumulates to a greater extent on @entity56			0
' slopes closer to the @entity22 show a larger hydrogen concentration difference			0
broader slopes provide stronger hydrogen signals than smaller slopes			0
since the 1960s scientists thought that only in permanently shadowed areas in craters near the lunar poles was it cold enough to accumulate this volatile material , but these results suggest that hydrogen on the moon is more widespread			2
at the moment , however , it 's uncertain if the hydrogen is abundant enough to economically mine			0
' the amounts we are detecting are still drier than the driest desert on @entity77 , ' said @entity59			1
the team now wants to see if the hydrogen abundance changes with the transition from day to night			0
if so , it would back up existing evidence of a very active production and cycling of hydrogen on the lunar surface , according to @entity59			0

hydrogen was found in larger quantities on slopes of the lunar south pole
these slopes could be mankind 's best hope finding water on the moon
scientists believe lunar water could be used for drinking by *astronauts*
its hydrogen and oxygen molecules may be used to create fuel and air
but the amounts detected are still drier than the driest desert on @entity77
