by @entity0 @entity2 director general @entity1 is to step down from the role this autumn			1
mr @entity1 announced the move in an email to staff at the corporation today after a meeting with @entity9 chairman @entity8			1
he said : ' this morning i told @entity8 that i believe that an appropriate time for me to hand over to a successor and to step down as director general of the @entity2 would be the autumn of this year , once the @entity15 and the rest of the amazing summer of 2012 are over			1
' stepping down : @entity2 director general @entity1 , left , is to step down from his role			1
it follows a meeting with @entity9 chairman @entity8 , right mr @entity1 said he had discussed his leaving date with @entity8 last year and said he wanted his successor to ' have time to really get their feet under the table ' before the next review of the @entity2 charter which will take place before the end of 2016			1
in his email to staff , mr @entity1 told them the corporation has ' weathered a series of lively storms ' during his time in charge			1
he took up the role of director general in june 2004 during one of the @entity2 's lowest points			1
it followed the @entity45 report which led to the resignations of the previous director general @entity47 and chairman @entity48			1
he steered the corporation through a string of tv fakery scandals			0
there was also @entity53 , which saw a public outcry over obscene messages left by @entity57 and @entity58 on @entity60 ' answerphone which were then broadcast on @entity58 's @entity62 show			0
in 2007 , there was also crowngate which saw then @entity66 controller @entity65 resign after misleading footage appearing to show the @entity68 storming out of a photoshoot was used in a trailer			0
he also oversaw the move to @entity72 which has seen around 2,000 staff move north and some high - profile faces , including @entity2 breakfast @entity75 , refuse to go			2
there have also been a number of efficiency drives which have cost thousands of jobs			0
however , he won respect for the way he handled the early renegotiation of the new @entity2 licence fee deal last year			2
other successes include the launch of the iplayer which has been a huge hit and allows viewers to catch up on shows via internet - connected tvs , computers and mobile phones			0
he told staff the corporation had ' weathered a series of lively storms ' during his almost eight years in the top job and was ' so much stronger than the @entity2 i inherited back in 2004 '			1
mr @entity1 said : ' @entity9 and approval are at record highs , our services are in brilliant creative form and we ’ve demonstrated beyond contradiction that the @entity2 can be just as much of a leader and innovator in the digital age as we once were in the analogue one			1
' he joined the @entity2 as a trainee in 1979 and worked on programmes including watchdog , @entity113 and @entity114 before leaving the corporation to become chief executive of @entity117 from 2002 to 2004			2
mr @entity1 's departure could lead to the @entity2 getting its first female director general			1
its chief operating officer @entity120 is second favourite to succeed @entity1 in the role , according to bookmakers			2
@entity125 - director of @entity126 - was declared the early favourite to take on the top job when rumours first emerged that mr @entity1 could be on his way out			1
whoever takes the job will also have to take a pay cut compared to what mr @entity1 was paid after @entity8 made clear the present salary of £ 671,000 would not be offered to his successor			1
@entity9 chairman @entity8 said : ' @entity1 has been an outstanding director general of the @entity2			1
he took over during a traumatic period in the corporation 's history and subsequently enhanced its reputation for creativity and quality , while setting the course for the @entity2 's digital future			2
' i will miss him on both a personal and professional level and i wish him the very best of luck for the future			0
the @entity9 will shortly begin the process of recruiting a successor			2
' great shape : mr @entity1 told staff the corporation was stronger than the @entity2 he inherited back in 2004 tribute : @entity1 paid tribute to @entity2 staff in an email announcing his departure last week in a speech to the @entity162 , i talked about our plans for the @entity15 and the other major broadcasting events of 2012			1
i pointed to the @entity2 ’s current strengths – in quality , creativity and world - class innovation in technology – as well as the big challenges we face both in living within our means and in getting the @entity2 ready for a digital future			0
i also commented on speculation about my own future , but promised to tell you and the @entity9 first when i had reached a view about the timetable			0
this morning i told @entity8 that i believe that an appropriate time for me to hand over to a successor and to step down as director general of the @entity2 would be the autumn of this year , once the @entity15 and the rest of the amazing summer of 2012 are over			1
when @entity186 became @entity2 chairman last year , i told him i thought there was a strong case for handing over to a successor sooner rather than later			2
from the point of view of the @entity2 , i thought that my successor should have time to really get their feet under the table before the next @entity199 process got going			0
i have told the chairman that i believe that he and the @entity9 should begin the public process of finding the next @entity202 as soon as they see fit			2
i will of course help them in that endeavour in any way i can			0
we can address the exact date of the handover once an appointment is made , though i have made it clear that i want to be guided by the wishes of the @entity9 and of my successor , whoever that may be			0
rather amazingly , with nearly eight years in the job i am already the longest - serving director general since the 1970s			2
over those eight years ( not to mention three chairmen , three prime ministers and five @entity217 ! ) , we ’ve weathered a series of lively storms and been through some trying as well as some very successful times together			0
hand over : mr @entity1 will stand down following the @entity15 this summer what has made my job not just bearable , but immensely enjoyable and rewarding , is all of you : your talent and energy , your unshakeable belief in the @entity2 and everything it stands for			1
i ’ve always been on the side of change because i believe that , in the middle of a media revolution , change is the only way of safeguarding what is so precious about the @entity2			0
but change always brings disruption and uncertainty in its wake – and i do want to say a particular thank you to everyone who has worked with me in the difficult task of transforming the @entity2			0
thank you for your commitment and for your patience			0
it ’s because of your efforts that the @entity2 i will be leaving is so much stronger than the @entity2 i inherited back in 2004			1
trust and approval are at record highs , our services are in brilliant creative form and we ’ve demonstrated beyond contradiction that the @entity2 can be just as much of a leader and innovator in the digital age as we once were in the analogue one			0
now more than ever , to audiences at home and abroad the @entity2 is the best broadcaster in the world			0
it ’s been a great privilege helping you to keep the @entity2 in that top spot over the past eight @entity265 ’m not off just yet though and i ’m looking forward to working with you over the coming months , as we prepare for the amazing summer of 2012 – as well as for the long - term future , and continued success , of the @entity2 .			0
