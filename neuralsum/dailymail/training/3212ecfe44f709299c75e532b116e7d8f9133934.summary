by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 11 february 2013 the top 1 per cent of working - age households in @entity3 now take home 10 per cent of all income paid in the economy - compared to the 18 per cent taken by the bottom half , it emerged today			1
the figures came in research by a think - tank that revealed the super-rich and bottom 50 per cent of working - age households in @entity3 shared the same proportion of income growth from 1994 to 2010			1
but this split up when looking at 1994 to 2011 , when 13 per cent of growth was claimed by the top 1 per cent , and 17 per cent by the poorest half of @entity3 - thanks in part to the 50p tax band launch			1
proportions : this @entity20 diagram shows how the share of growth in working - age income dropped for the top 1 per cent in 2010 - 2011 to 10 per cent , after being 13 per cent for 1994 - 2011 the @entity20 think - tank research ’s starting point was 1994 , with the top 1 per cent and bottom 50 per cent each claiming 16 per cent of growth up to 2010 , before the figure divided in 2011			1
the 50p top tax rate on incomes above £ 150,000 , brought in by chancellor @entity30 in april 2010 , saw a slide in the very richest ’s earnings , but it will fall to 45p in april , reported the @entity33			2
while the poorest half of working - age households now receive just 18p of every £ 1 of income generated , down from 19p in 1994 - 95 , the richest 10 per cent receive 33p of every £ 1 , up from 29p			1
the share of households which fall below the richest top 10 per cent but are above middle income - known as the upper middle income group - has fallen from 52 per cent to 49 per cent			2
wages went down in real terms across income groups during the recession years of 2008 to 2011			0
cash in hand : while the poorest half of working - age households now receive just 18p of every £ 1 of income generated , down from 19p in 1994 - 95 , the richest 10 per cent receive 33p of every £ 1 , up from 29p but in the five years prior to the recession - 2003 to 2008 - the top 10 per cent of earners saw their gross wages continue to grow in real terms , from a full - time average of £ 75,980 to £ 79,650			1
' the growing gap in incomes is pronounced when you look at the top 10th of households and overwhelming when you consider the position of the top one per cent			0
the rest of society has n’t kept up ' @entity61 , @entity20 senior economist meanwhile the wages of typical workers stalled - and those of the least well - paid dropped from a pre-tax average £ 12,750 to £ 12,230			0
@entity20 senior economist @entity61 said : ‘ despite the recent dip in the fortunes of the top 1 per cent , if we take the longer view we see that the very wealthiest have continued to prosper while many others have not			2

’ he added that @entity3 has become ‘ a particularly difficult place for families below middle income who have to cope with flat wages , falling tax credits and rising prices ’ .			0

bottom 50 ********%******** receive 18p of £ 1 , while top 10 ********%******** take 33p , up from 29p in 1994
the top 1 ********%******** and bottom 50 ********%******** shared same income growth from 1994 to 2010
but top 1 ********%******** had 13 ********%******** and bottom 50 ********%******** had 17 ********%******** of growth from 1994 to 2011
the split in 2011 is thanks in part to the launch of @entity30 *'s* 50p tax band
