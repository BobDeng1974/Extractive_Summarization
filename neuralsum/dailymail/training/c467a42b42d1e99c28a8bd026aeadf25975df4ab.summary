the @entity0 was , in terms of racing , the toughest day of the year for me			1
for our car to break down and then to watch the remainder of the action on the pit wall was a really strange feeling			1
as soon as i stepped into the car before heading to the grid for the race everything stopped working			1
up until that point it had all been fine , but the moment i sat in the cockpit we encountered problems which really was quite amazing			0
my team managed to get the car up and running so i could head to the grid before the pit - lane closed			1
i remained positive and hoped that the problem would resolve itself because it was quite intermittent , but it did n't work out			2
@entity25 watches the @entity0 from the pit wall after being force to retire after 14 laps @entity25 's car is pushed off the @entity31 on a day the driver says was his toughest of the year ' it was like having only half a car , ' says @entity25 ( centre ) , such were the problems leading to his withdrawal the cable connection in the steering column was short - circuited , so the steering wheel simply did not work			1
the gearshift paddles worked , but not to their full capacity as it was upshifting double gears			0
what i mean by that is when i wanted to go from third to fourth it went from third to fifth and so on			0
it really was all over the place			0
i could n't use kers and i did not have any electrical power			0
i did n't have @entity54 either so it was like having only half a car			2
i was at the back of the field and could n't pass the @entity59 of @entity60 , so on lap 14 we decided to call it a day as it was pointless continuing like that			2
it was n't my decision to retire , but the team felt it was in our best interest			1
it was a big pity as we lost a lot of points , particularly to my team - mate @entity71 who won the race			1
but after i retired i decided to hang around to see if i could learn anything			0
on the pit wall there is always an opportunity to listen in to what is going on so that 's what i did and i certainly picked up a few pointers			1
i could see what the team were doing strategically during the race			2
i have never had the opportunity to sit there and do that , so it was a good experience for me to see it from that point of view as i am normally in my race car			2
when @entity25 's @entity90 ' could n't pass @entity59 's @entity60 ( left ) it was time to call it a day while disappointed , @entity25 says he took the opportunity to see how the team operate on the pit wall the team apologised to me after the race which was a nice gesture from them			1
we now know what the problem was and i have absolutely moved on from it			0
i am very , very positive and looking forward to the final five races of the season			2
i should also mention that it was fantastic that we still had the best car in @entity105 as it has been throughout the season			2
during qualifying , it was incredible that @entity71 and i were separated by just seven - thousandths of a second on a circuit which is over three miles in length			0
that difference between us both crossing the start - finish line on our respective laps was not even the width of my foot , but it decided first and second place on the grid which was pretty tough to take			0
that said i was still pleased to be starting second and looking forward to what could have been a brilliant battle , but then we had our reliability issue			0
certainly reliability is the weakness of our team at the moment and we are working flat out to try and improve on that area			0
but i do n't worry about the car breaking down			0
i trust my team , and if it happens , it happens , but it is not something i am concerned about at all			0
the @entity136 team work on @entity25 's car after he was taken off the track at the @entity31 i am now three points behind @entity71 in the championship but i will not approach this weekend 's @entity141 @entity0 any differently			1
the plan is to win and that has always been the case so i will try to do the same thing here			0
it is an amazing situation to be in with the team and despite what happened in @entity105 there is still everything to play for so i am in full - on attack heading into this weekend			1
indeed it is the first time that i have arrived in @entity153 knowing that i have the best car on this incredible circuit so we have the opportunity to be on pole and win which is an awesome feeling and i want to make the most of it			1
@entity25 ( right ) is now three points behind team - mate @entity162 after the @entity163 won in @entity105 @entity153 is without question one of the best circuits on the calendar and the fans are so enthusiastic and very , very unique			1
they go nuts for @entity168 which is , as a driver and someone who loves the sport , too , always brilliant to see			2
it has been very wet this week but if it rains at any point over the weekend i am not concerned because our car is amazing in the damp conditions			1
after the race in @entity105 i went on holiday to @entity180 to try and adapt to the timezone for this weekend 's race so i have no jet lag			1
i spent most of my time relaxing and training ; having a rest in between races is always a good opportunity to ramp up the fitness , too			2
after some rest and training in @entity180 , @entity25 's back to business at a @entity194 function in @entity195 @entity25 fulfils his duties to his sponsors ahead of a race on a track he says is one of @entity168 's best in @entity153 the @entity201 has been taken off the car so the diet which we were all concerned about before the start of the season is not as much of an issue now			1
i can easily put on a few kilos which is refreshing			0
but to be honest i have stuck closely to the same diet because i have plenty of energy and felt really good , having adapted my nutrition			0
on wednesday i was in @entity195 for a sponsors event and it really is an awesome city			1
there is so much that you can do there			0
i also went for dinner in a really amazing japanese restaurant			0
i always enjoy @entity141 very much ! @entity25 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity223 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity168 mechanics and their families , putting @entity168 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			1
you can follow @entity25 on @entity235 @ nico_rosberg and @entity90 @ @entity236			0
