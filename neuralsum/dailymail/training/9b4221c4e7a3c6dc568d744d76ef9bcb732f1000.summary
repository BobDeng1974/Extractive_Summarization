@entity23 and @entity24 had launched a £ 92,000 legal action over losses resulting from mrs @entity2 ’s killing in 2008			1
an itemised damage claim included £ 4,555 for new carpets , £ 782 for dry - cleaning blood - stained curtains and £ 2,100 for redecorating bloodied walls at £ 900,000 @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34			1
another £ 15,446.06 was attributed to ‘ blight ’ – with the @entity36 claiming mrs @entity2 ’s death had caused both the value of the property and its rental income to plunge			1

‘ we just could n’t believe it			0
the @entity36 were perfectly within their legal rights but whether it was ethical			2
well , it was n’t , was it ? @entity48 was jailed for nine years after he stabbed his wife @entity74 more than 30 times after she had an affair ‘ how could anyone do that to children			0
it does n’t matter whether the law was on their side or what damage had been caused			0
’ mrs @entity41 said lawyers had advised that paying the £ 13,000 under a ‘ deed of assignment ’ was the only way to avoid further liability			2
