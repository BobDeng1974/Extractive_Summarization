it was a stunning goal that will live long in the memory - @entity1 soaring through the air to head @entity5 level in their @entity7 opener against defending champions @entity9			0
here , from @entity12 's inch - perfect 50 - yard ball from the flank to his exuberant high - five celebration with coach @entity15 on the sidelines , here 's the goal step - by - step			2
a routine ball out from the back comes to @entity12 who controls the ball , takes another touch and looks up to @entity21 calling for the ball the @entity24 striker spots an opportunity with @entity26 jeopardising @entity9 ’s high line by dropping back to mark @entity28 , @entity30 ’s most likely target with @entity21 sprinting for space , blind gambles and hits a 51 - yard pass from the left - hand touchline in search of his side ’s chief goal - getter @entity21 knows by now that he is @entity30 ’s intended target and he darts away from a surprised @entity40 , who is left trailing in his wake with @entity40 ’ marking now an afterthought , @entity21 is on his own as he reaches the edge of the area			1
but with @entity12 ’s ball coming in a couple of yards ahead of him he recognises that he needs to improvise @entity48 comes off his line to help deal with the danger of @entity21 running through , only to realise that the @entity52 is certain to get there first @entity21 throws himself , head first , at the ball as it comes across him and makes contact that most would struggle to control from 15 yards out the 30 - year - old centre forward ’s header brilliantly floats above the @entity59 ‘ keeper with @entity1 watching on as he falls to the floor @entity48 can only watch on as the header drops beneath the crossbar and nestles neatly in the back of his net @entity21 , by now sprawled on the ground , watches his wondergoal cross the line before jumping up to celebrate with @entity15 on the touchline			0

@entity12 pinged a 51 - yard ball from wide left to @entity21
the @entity24 striker watched the *flight* of the ball and moved away from @entity40
@entity21 then jumped *acrobatically* into the air and headed the ball over @entity48
the striker sprinted off to high - five coach @entity15 on the touchline
@entity5 went on to thrash the defending champions 5 - 1
