@entity1 's anti-gay stance was thrown into confusion today by speculation that fake lesbian pop duo @entity4 will be the surprise performers at the opening ceremony of the @entity8			1
the line - up for the february 7 opening ceremony is a closely guarded secret , but flame - haired singer @entity12 yesterday tweeted ' we have been invited to take part at the @entity15 '			2
the announcement follows worldwide criticism of @entity1 over recently passed laws held to be discriminatory against gays			2
not schoolgirls any more : a picture from @entity4 's social media site shows the pair posing next to a @entity15 photo			1
there is speculation that the controversial faux lesbian pop duo could perform there @entity12 and her bandmate @entity29 were just teenagers when they burst into worldwide musical superstardom with their critically acclaimed 2003 single all the things she had			1
but the duo also courted controversy with a risque music video which showed them standing in the rain and sharing a passionate kiss while dressed in revealing school uniform - like outfits			1
children 's groups in @entity43 reacted with outrage amid claims their act was a marketing stunt promoting homosexuality among vulnerable teenagers			1
so speculation that @entity4 will be one of the acts at @entity53 comes as a surprise with @entity1 currently mired in controversy after new laws were passed in the country which ban homosexual ' propaganda ' to children			1
the legislation is drawn so widely that there are fears it could trap gay visitors or competitors in @entity53 - or even tatu themselves			2
mayor of @entity53 , @entity67 , was quoted this week saying there are no gay people in his @entity71 resort			0
earlier @entity72 said gay people could feel ' relaxed ' about attending the @entity15 but they should ' leave children alone please '			1
but still cuddling up : speculation that @entity4 will be one of the acts at @entity53 is ironic with @entity1 currently mired in controversy after new laws were passed in the country which ban homosexual ' propaganda ' to children however , the appearance of @entity4 at the @entity8 opening ceremony is not yet confirmed			1
@entity12 , now 29 , later withdrew her post announcing their appearance , replacing it with a message stating : ' all statements will be made at the right moment			0
as it turned out , this was not yet the right moment			0
' despite this , a number of major news websites reported that the controversial duo will be on stage in @entity53			1
' @entity12 and @entity29 from @entity4 will be singing at @entity15 opening ceremony , ' stated news outlet gazeta.ru			0
montages of @entity12 and @entity29 , 28 , posing with the @entity99 symbol were posted on the group 's social network site , but there were also claims it could be a publicity stunt			1
@entity12 also criticised the organisers for ' disgustingly bad organisation '			0
she ranted : ' they treat artists like * * it			0
' controversial : a frame of the music video for all the things she had which showed @entity12 and @entity29 standing in the rain and sharing a passionate kiss while dressed in revealing school uniform - like outfits although the pair are now both grown up women in their late 20s , images of @entity12 and @entity29 still show them posing as schoolgirls			0
despite officially splitting in 2011 , the duo recently performed together			2
@entity29 is reported to be currently in @entity122 having undergone @entity124 treatment in her lips			0
she has two children - a daughter @entity127 , aged 9 , and son @entity128 , 6 - from two marriages			2
@entity12 wed @entity131 musician @entity130 in august last year			0
@entity1 @entity99 chiefs declined to comment on any role for @entity4 .			0

ironically , children 's groups in @entity43 once *accused* the pop duo of promoting homosexuality among teenagers
