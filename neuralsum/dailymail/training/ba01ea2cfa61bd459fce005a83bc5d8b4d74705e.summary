faced with an opponent nicknamed ' @entity2 ' , @entity0 might have been expecting quite a fight in his second round at the @entity5			1
instead , @entity6 fairly ushered him into the last 32 this morning , going down 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 with a slew of unforced errors , detaining him for just 102 minutes			1
it was a highly satisfactory bit of work for @entity0 , who enjoyed the precious economy of getting things over and done with quickly on what was the first day of sapping temperatures at @entity15			2
@entity0 looks to the skies as he books his place in the last 32 of the @entity5 @entity0 signs autographs for fans after his win over @entity6 @entity0 looked in complete control as he beat @entity6 in straight sets @entity0 won the first set in just 21 minutes and dropped just one point on his serve @entity6 struggled to get into the game and was no real test for the @entity28 seed @entity0 will now face world number 55 @entity29 , who went through when his opponent @entity31 retired through injury in the fourth set of their match			1
the 27 year - old @entity36 is now 10 - 0 versus @entity37 in his career , and the contest against @entity6 went to type			1
asked if he did not like @entity37 he replied , ' i love @entity37 , i had no idea about that			2
with the young players coming through here i 'm not sure how long i 'll keep that record up			0
@entity0 dropped just six games on his way to the third round @entity49 was in the box on the @entity51 as she watched @entity0 ease to victory ' i started extremely well today , he improved as the match went on and there were some closer games in the second and third sets that could have gone either way			1
i really enjoyed it even if not everyone was supporting me			0
' it was nice to finish and not to be out here for too long			0
' returning to the secondary @entity51 , @entity0 was far too solid against the world number 81 , who has destructive power while also having the ability to self - destruct			1
this was not one for the body language purists as @entity6 continually waved his arms around in frustration while the world number six also got irritated with himself at times , despite being in control from the off			2
the first set took just 21 minutes as his opponent contributed 16 unforced errors			2
there was a small blight on @entity0 in him dropping serve once in the second as @entity6 lifted his level , but there were never any serious alarms			1
by the end @entity6 had run up 49 unforced errors , but that should not detract from the professional performance of @entity0 in one of his matches that will only linger very briefly in the memory			1
he is easing himself towards tougher tasks ahead , although @entity29 should not prove too scary a prospect			2
@entity0 barely had to break sweat on the hottest day of the @entity5 so far @entity0 looked very comfortable as he booked his place in the last 32 in @entity15 @entity0 's fans make themselves heard despite most of the spectators getting behind @entity6 @entity0 denied later that he brought any extra determination to the match after @entity6 â€™s comments last summer that he did not think it a good idea hiring a female coach like @entity104 : ' no. i get on well with @entity6 , ' he said			1
' i spoke to him a little bit about what he said			0
he did n't mean any harm			0
everyone 's entitled to their opinion on anything			0
if he wants to get coached by a man , that 's absolutely fine			0
' i have absolutely no issue with it at all			0
i still think he 's a good guy			0
i was n't trying to prove a point at all when i was playing @entity6 today			1
i was trying to win the match			0
' occasionally @entity0 can be a slow starter , so he was delighted today about the way he fairly sprinted to the first set : ' i definitely started quite quickly today			1
i was timing the ball well on the return and serving well from the beginning of the match , and it helped a lot because obviously the crowd were behind him			0
i managed to take the crowd out of it a little bit by starting that quickly			0

@entity0 beat @entity6 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2
@entity0 dropped just one point on his serve in the first set
@entity0 will face @entity29 of @entity135 in the third round
