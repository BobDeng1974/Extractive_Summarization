hailed as one of the most imaginative minds in history , dr @entity0 created magical worlds with playful rhymes and kooky illustrations			0
but it seems his words have come to life somewhere in the depths of @entity11			0
this towering structure 130 miles from @entity13 was once a two - story home , built after a forest fire swept the valley clean of trees			1
dr @entity0 fans flock to @entity11 to visit this 12 - cabin - high structure that looks like one of his illustrations teetering : the owner wanted to be able to see the idyllic valley over the tall trees around their cabin in need of renovation : it was abandoned for years but new owners are now renovating it eclectic : the storys are bound together with metal sticks and unusual platforms it seemed unfathomable to dr @entity0 fans that a real life version of this tower could be created however , when the trees eventually started shooting up again , the owner refused to relinquish his idyllic view of the mountains			1
now it teeters at an impressive 12 storys high , bearing a stark resemblance to the kind of houses drawn in dr @entity0 's books			2
stands out : the house is miles from any other home , about 130 miles from the center of @entity13 ' we made it ! ' : these are just two of the hundreds of @entity57 posts taken by fans outside the property birds - eye view : @entity61 captured the unusual tower in all its glory after a heavy bout of snow and it has not gone unnoticed			1
hordes of dr @entity0 fans have flocked to ' climb the tower ' in the past few years			2
according to this is colossal , the house was eventually abandoned by the imaginative architect			0
the site notes , however , that new owners are now renovating the property to withstand the heavy winds .			0

@entity76 built cabin near @entity13 valley after forest fire
when the trees started growing again , they did *n't* want to lose the view
so they built another cabin on *top* , and carried on until it was 12 high
it has been *affectionately* *dubbed* the ' dr @entity91 ' and attracts fans
