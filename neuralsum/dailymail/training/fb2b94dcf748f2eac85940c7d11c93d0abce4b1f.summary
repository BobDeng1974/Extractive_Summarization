@entity1 missed @entity3 ’s flagship foreign aid target last year despite handing out an extra £ 2.7billion , it emerged yesterday			1
the figures , buried in an official report , suggest the country could have to fork out up to £ 750million extra by the end of next month in order to hit the target this year – although @entity11 sources insisted the final increase would be lower			1
the revelations are an embarrassment for the prime minister who has repeatedly boasted about meeting his pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of @entity1 ’s annual income on foreign aid			1
ministers are now backing legislation which would make it illegal for future governments to miss the aid target			2
critics said the figures demonstrated the ‘ idiocy ’ of trying to hit an ‘ arbitrary ’ target			2
@entity30 mp @entity29 said : ‘ this just goes to show the absolute nonsense of committing this ludicrous target into law			0
we have thrown billions at it and still missed it , and now we will presumably throw hundreds of millions more at it			0
’ the foreign aid budget was increased by more than 30 per cent last year in order to meet the target			1
the £ 2.7billion increase took total spending to £ 11.5billion			0
in april this year the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) boasted this amounted to 0.72 per cent of @entity1 ’s @entity46 ( @entity46 ) – exceeding the target for the first time			1
but the latest @entity44 report suggests that new , higher estimates of @entity46 mean aid last year actually amounted to 0.67 per cent			1
spending was about £ 400million short of the sum needed			0
but , with @entity1 growth running at an estimated 3 per cent , the government would have to find another £ 750million to hit the new measure this year			1
the problem is similar to the one that landed the @entity1 with a demand for £ 1.7billion from the @entity61 last month			1
estimates of @entity46 have been revised upwards three times this year by the @entity64 , adding £ 107billion to the total			2
the changes mean targets based on @entity46 have gone up			0
the last of these revisions , which added about a third of the total increase , results from @entity73 accounting rules that include estimates of parts of the black economy such as prostitution and drug running			0
government sources said @entity44 will be allowed to stick to old accounting methods this year to ensure a ‘ consistent methodology ’			0
the effect of this will be to limit the impact of the rise in @entity46			0
our economy will grow ten times faster than that of @entity89 this year and four times faster next year , according to official @entity92 figures			0
the @entity61 expects output in the @entity1 to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015			1
this compares with growth of just 0.3 per cent in @entity89 this year and 0.7 per cent next year			1
the @entity96 has predicted @entity1 will next year overtake @entity89 to become @entity98 ’s second biggest economy behind @entity99			1
but , even with this , the figures still suggest aid spending may have to rise by about £ 500million , taking the total aid budget to £ 12billion			2
@entity44 insisted it had met the target based on economic figures ‘ at the time ’			2
the department declined to comment on the likely implications for this year ’s aid budget			2
international development minister @entity110 told @entity111 the aid budget is ‘ not popular among a significant proportion of the public ’ but said it was the right thing to do			0
the latest figures come despite a frantic effort by @entity44 to hit the target last year			1
a highly critical report by the @entity121 international development committee revealed ministers splurged almost £ 100million a day in december			0
last week an independent report slammed @entity44 for a failure to tackle corruption in developing countries .			0

@entity3 pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of annual income on foreign aid
*due* to @entity1 *'s* economic growth , the bill gets bigger each month
@entity1 could have to fork out £ 750million extra to hit the target this year
