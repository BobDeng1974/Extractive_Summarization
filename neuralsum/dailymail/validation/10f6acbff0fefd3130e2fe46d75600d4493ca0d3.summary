a video maker from @entity1 captured some incredibly eerie footage of a disused @entity4 station in @entity5			0
@entity6 , a @entity7 graduate , travelled to the @entity9 station with a phantom 2 dji drone and a @entity12 camera			1
he was drawn to the location because he was bored of filming the fields around where he lives and after purchasing a drone believed the station would be an interesting place in which to capture some unique footage			0
helped by his friend @entity21 , who drove the pair to the location , @entity6 squeezed through a hole in a fence and spent an hour filming and an additional nine hours editing once home			1
looking back on the project , @entity6 , who was merely testing out his new equipment on the day , admitted he was ecstatic with the final product			1
he said : ‘ it had been a bit trial and error at first as i do n’t have a monitor for the drone so i was flying blind			0
‘ i was just holding certain shots and hoping they would come out okay			0
when i got back and saw the outcome though i was buzzing			0
@entity6 was drawn to the location because he was bored of filming the fields around where he lives in @entity43 after squeezing through a fence , @entity6 captured some truly atmospheric footage of the abandoned @entity4 base ' i knew for sure that the drone had been a good purchase			1
’ the video itself is both chilling and mesmerising and captures the abandonment of the place in all its eerie glory			2
opening on a shot of tall trees , the footage fades into a birds - eye view of the abandoned @entity4 station			2
unsettling music accompanies the clip throughout as the drone moves slowly around the area capturing it entirely			0
footage of the buildings up - close show the extent of the deterioration that has taken place since the base was closed @entity6 was only testing his @entity12 camera and drone but was ecstatic with the final outcome nevertheless @entity74 is a former non-flying station			1
it was under the control of the @entity78 from 1981 , and one of three @entity4 stations in @entity9 used by the @entity78 in @entity81			0
in 1994 the station was closed by the @entity83 and most of it was vacated with the land and buildings being sold off to civil ownership			0
@entity6 explained that the size of the abandoned place was overwhelming and that this helped influence his decision to depict it in a spooky way			1
he said : ‘ it was eerie being in there so it only felt right to edit it in the way that i did			0
’ the drone then stalks a man ( @entity6 ’s friend @entity97 ) walking through the isolated landscape before ascending over his head			1
the footage then fades into arguably the best shot of the piece – a vantage point that captures the sun breaking through miserable clouds , and the trees appearing as silhouettes			2
featured in the film is @entity6 's friend @entity97 , whose presence adds another spooky element to the piece @entity6 captures a great shot of the sun breaking through the miserable clouds and the building 's dark and empty windows also featured in the shot is the building ’s darkened , empty windows as well as a row of them in the distance that appear to look like a series of letters			1
faster footage of the buildings follow and a close - up shot of one of the entrances show the depreciation that has taken place			2
@entity97 again features – standing in one of the windows – giving the piece another strange and spooky element			0
@entity6 admitted however that his intention had been to use someone dressed in military uniform so as to provide an even ghostlier edge , but stated that he does intend to do a follow up piece at a later date			2
@entity6 took a total of nine hours to edit the footage of the station after filming it for an hour with a drone ‘ i felt i could have done a lot better if i had planned it , ’ he said			1
‘ but for test footage i was chuffed to bits with it			0
’ @entity6 studied @entity150 at university , with a focus on film and tv , script writing and film production			1
he has recently started a media company called @entity158 , where he uploads videos of his work			0
