a girl of 13 who frequently went missing from her care home with men was considered by police to be making a ‘ lifestyle choice ’ , a damning report has found			1
the case is one of a string of ‘ unacceptable ’ failures by @entity12 in protecting children at risk of sexual exploitation			1
the seriousness of the girl ’s case was dismissed even though it was clear from police systems that she was being , or was at high - risk of being , sexually exploited , according to the report by @entity24			2
@entity26 @entity25 ( pictured left ) and @entity12 assistant chief constable @entity28 ( right ) it said : ‘ staff need to understand that children do not make a “ lifestyle choice ” to be abused , particularly those who are more vulnerable because of the neglect they have already suffered in their life			2
’ the report said the police force needed to take ‘ immediate action ’ after finding the attitudes of some officers towards victims of exploitation were unacceptable			1
@entity24 assessed 115 cases involving children during an inspection in june and found the responses by the force to 42 per cent were ‘ inadequate ’			1
in one case , information was sent to the force ’s intelligence unit about groups or gangs of men who may have been raping younger girls but no follow - up action took place , @entity24 reported			1
it found sexual abuse cases faced ‘ unnecessary and long delays ’ and officers blamed ‘ high workloads ’ for failing to carry out necessary checks			1
for instance , one 11 - year - old girl who received texts of a sexual nature from a man was ignored by police for two months			1
one 15 - year - old girl left a care home in her pyjamas and got into a car with a man but no checks were made when she returned the next morning at 6am			1
nine out of 11 cases involving children missing from home were not handled properly , while some officers were ' frustrated ' by care homes reporting youngsters as missing because they were passing responsibility to police , the watchdog said			0
in one child sex exploitation case , information was sent to the force 's intelligence unit about men who may have been raping younger girls but no follow - up action took place , @entity24 said			1
inspectors found cases where ' vital information ' had not been recorded including one of children found ' living in chaos ' because of their parents ' criminality and another involving the sexual exploitation of a 13 - year - old girl			1
they also raised concerns about delays in the arrests of offenders , and found officers had closed cases without sufficient consideration of the risk posed to other potential victims , the report found			1
@entity12 ( pictured ) have been criticised for the way they deal with cases of vulnerable children in 13 of 18 assessed cases involving child sexual exploitation , inspectors found ' poor risk management of known suspects , significant delays in arrest and a failure to identify suspects ' , according to the report			1
inspectors also found ' indications of a wider network of men offending in groups and gangs ' that had not been identified and were therefore not followed up , @entity24 said			1
the watchdog said only six out of 15 cases of children held in police custody were handled adequately , and some custody staff ' lacked awareness and knowledge about child protection '			0
in one case , a 13 - year - old girl in custody told a nurse that she had a history of mental health issues , but this did not trigger a review of her risk assessment , the report found			1
the report concluded : ' overall , the force 's response to tackling child sexual exploitation has been slow , with inconsistent practice across the force area			2
there was a general lack of understanding of the extent of exploitation			0
' some of the attitudes officers held towards potential victims of child sexual exploitation or children who ran away were unacceptable and resulted in poor decision making			1
' staff need to understand that children do not make a ' lifestyle choice ' to be abused , particularly those who are more vulnerable because of the neglect they have already suffered in their life			0
' we recommend that @entity12 takes immediate action to review its plans for identifying , disrupting and prosecuting perpetrators involved in child sexual exploitation			1
' @entity26 @entity25 added : ' the force needs to improve both its approach to the more complex child protection cases and a better understanding of the extent of child sexual exploitation in the @entity182			2
' i would like to encourage @entity12 to address our concerns immediately , and have asked that within six weeks it provides us with an action plan to demonstrate how it will act upon these recommendations			2
' @entity12 assistant chief constable @entity28 said : ' i want @entity12 to be the best in country - dealing with vulnerable children with professionalism and compassion			2
@entity195 , minister for crime prevention , and shadow home secretary @entity194 have both expressed their concern following the publication of the damning @entity24 report into @entity12 ' @entity201 has been doubled in strength to some 800 officers and staff			2
that means around 10 per cent of the entire force are engaged in the fight			0
that displays our level of commitment			0
' it 's unfortunate that the @entity24 inspection came just two days into new arrangements so do not reflect our exciting changes as there was so little time for them to be place			0
' we can not do it alone			0
we must work hand in hand with our partners , especially the local authorities			0
crime prevention minister @entity195 said : ' i am very concerned by the contents of this @entity24 report			0
the safety of our children , and the elimination of child abuse , are top priorities for this department and the coalition as a whole			0
' that is why the home secretary has announced an independent inquiry into child sexual abuse within public bodies and non-state institutions			0
' she is also leading cross-government work to learn the lessons of past failures and has written to all chief constables stressing the highest standards must be met in tackling child sexual exploitation			0
' @entity12 must take urgent action to consider all the recommendations in this report and ensure that improvements are made			2
' shadow home secretary @entity194 mp said : ' everywhere across the country , not enough is being done to protect children from abuse			0
' this @entity24 report shows the @entity182 police leadership have made this a priority , but there are still serious problems over the extent of abuse , understanding of the problem and lack of other specialist support			0
' and it shows there is a growing problem in the @entity182 and everywhere else about online child abuse which the police are struggling to investigate			0

@entity12 need to take ' immediate action ' after some officers ' attitudes towards child sex victims were found to be ' unacceptable '
report says nearly half of responses to child sex cases were ' inadequate '
indications of a network of men offending in gangs was not followed up
' vital information ' about 13 - year - old victim of sex exploitation not recorded
in 13 of 18 cases force failed to identify suspects and had delays in arrests
information about men who may have raped young girls was not followed up
