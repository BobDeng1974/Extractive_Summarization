many of these patients are less likely to have potentially life - saving surgery because they are diagnosed too late and the cancer is too advanced , according to surgeons			0
women , the elderly and less well - off were most at risk of losing out on early diagnosis and care			1
too late ? one in four cases of bowel cancer are diagnosed in @entity21 a national audit found that around 8,000 bowel cancer patients in @entity24 each year get attention only after an emergency admission to hospital			1

‘ patients who present with this disease as an emergency are more likely to be suffering with advanced stage cancer and , as a result , are less likely to be suitable for potentially life - saving surgery			0
‘ more must be done to improve early detection and to raise awareness around the symptoms of bowel cancer			1
‘ the @entity69 programme has now been rolled out across the country and it is so important that patients take up the invitation to be screened as this will vastly improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment outcomes			2
’ the data , covering the period between august 2009 and july 2010 , found 28 per cent of women patients – 3,820 of a total of 13,570 – were diagnosed after an emergency hospital @entity83 men , this figure was 22 per cent – 3,870 of 17,240 patients			0
