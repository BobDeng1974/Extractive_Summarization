sacking @entity0 on the back of saturday ’s defeat against @entity3 would be harsh			1
if @entity5 chairman @entity4 was looking at their performance against @entity3 for reasons to pull the trigger then he needed to look pretty hard			1
this was n’t the performance of a side who are n’t in tune with their manager , just one lacking attacking invention			0
@entity5 manager @entity0 has been under the spotlight after his side 's latest @entity20 defeat @entity0 ( far left ) has been backed to keep his job at @entity23 despite losing against @entity3 @entity0 is in regular contact with @entity5 chairman @entity4 , who has supported his manager on the evidence of saturday ’s display , @entity5 players are very much with their underfire manager			1
nevertheless , there are still figures within the @entity23 hierarchy who believe @entity0 ’s time should be up			2
click here to read the match report as @entity38 's team won 2 - 0 for them , their woeful away form is simply not good enough			0
for them , his constant reference to the club being able to sign only loan players this month is an excuse to hide the deficiencies of the previous transfer window			1
for them , @entity5 will be relegated if the club decide against making a change and see now as the perfect time			2
following their exit from the @entity56 , @entity54 now have just under two weeks until their next @entity20 clash against @entity58			0
from the outside looking in it seems there is no time like the present to make a managerial change early this week			0
@entity4 , so far , has backed his manager and resisted any urge to make a change , despite people telling him otherwise			2
the formation of @entity0 ’s substitutes bench on saturday would n’t have helped the manager ’s cause , though			0
@entity72 and @entity73 were both there , having arrived in the summer			0
fellow summer signing @entity75 did n’t even make the matchday squad , while @entity78 , who had a history of knee problems during his time at @entity82 , remains unavailable — with a knee injury			0
@entity84 ( left ) came on as a second half substitute to wrap up the match for the visitors with this goal @entity84 ( left ) celebrates scoring @entity3 's second goal of the game in their 2 - 0 win at @entity5 goalkeeper @entity92 , signed from @entity93 , is still second choice to veteran keeper @entity95 and loan signing @entity96 is yet to feature , having joined from @entity98 earlier this month			1
so , with that in mind , @entity0 ’s hurry to point out that the club can only afford to sign loan players this month has not gone down too well among members of the @entity23 hierarchy			1
having spoken to @entity4 on the phone last week , @entity0 has been assured his job is n’t under threat			1
however , should @entity4 start listening to some of the dissenting voices , that could yet change .			0

despite loss against @entity3 @entity5 looked in tune with their boss
@entity0 *claimed* he is only able to sign loan players this month
chairman @entity4 has been urged to make managerial changes
