federal officials who investigated the deadly @entity2 crash that killed 230 people have insisted it was an accident after a documentary claimed the plane was hit by explosions outside the aircraft			1
current and former federal officials said yesterday they stand by their conclusion that the fatal explosion was caused by overheated fuel tank vapors , and not a bomb or missile			1
the officials spoke to reporters yesterday at a briefing on the @entity19 's four - year investigation following the explosion and crash of the @entity22 off @entity23 , @entity24 , on july 17 , 1996			1
the crash - the third - deadliest aviation accident in @entity28 history - occurred just 12 minutes after take - off from @entity29 on the flight bound for @entity31 , @entity32			2
the board took the usual step of organizing the briefing on an investigation that has been closed for years in response to the documentary set to air this month on the 17th anniversary of the tragedy			1
the film says new evidence points to the often - discounted theory that a missile strike may have downed the jumbo jet			2
the officials who spoke at the briefing dismissed allegations of a cover - up , saying that the evidence points strongly to the board 's conclusion that overheated gases in the plane 's near - empty fuel tank caused the tank to explode			1
the gases were most likely ignited by a spark from damaged wiring in a fuel measuring system			0
@entity69 , the current director of the board 's @entity70 , was the chief fire and explosives investigator on the flight 800 investigation			0
he said he is ' absolutely ' certain the fuel tank was the cause			1
' we went to the ' nth degree , and then some , ' he said , laying out the different facets of the investigation			0
investigators tested shoulder - fired missiles to see if they would show up on radar and used another 747 to replicate the overheating of fuel tank vapors , among other tests			1
' i am upset about bringing this back up , for the sake of the people who lost folks in the accident , ' @entity69 said			0
' it 's not good			0
' two family members of those killed attended the briefing			0
investigators who worked on the plane following the crash and co-producer @entity100 , said there was no evidence that the explosion came from the wing tank federal officials say they stand by claim that crash caused by fuel vapors ignited by faulty wiring			1
images from the documentary show damaged seats on the plane , aboard which 230 people died ' i think they did a complete and thorough investigation in the beginning , ' said @entity118 of @entity119 , @entity120 , whose sister , @entity122 , was a flight attendant on the plane			1
' these are old conspiracy theories that have been around since the beginning			0
' @entity126 of @entity127 , @entity128 , who lost his 29 - year - old son , @entity130 , said the board 's investigation seems ' pretty cut and dried as far as i 'm concerned			2
' but there are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb			0
' the documentary features interviews with key members of the original investigation team , who now claim that their investigation was systematically undermined			2
' this team of investigators who actually handled the wreckage and victims ' bodies , prove that the officially proposed fuel - air explosion did not cause the crash , ' said the film 's producers			1
' they also provide radar and forensic evidence proving that one or more ordinance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash			2
' @entity19 officials involved in the investigation who were not at the briefing have also defended its handling , describing the investigation as one of the most extensive and exhaustive in the board 's history			1
the board issued a 400 - page report on the accident , accompanied by more than 17,000 pages of supporting material			0
but there have long been doubters			0
they include three former investigators - one from the @entity19 , one from @entity174 and one from the @entity176 - who appear in the film			2
the former investigators have also signed a petition filed with the @entity19 to reconsider reopen the probe			2
@entity181 , a spokeswoman for the board , said they are considering the petition and has asked parties to the original investigation for their comments			0
a decision on whether to reopen the investigation will be made by board officials who were not part of the original investigation and were not part of yesterday 's briefing , she said			2
one of the former investigators who signed the petition , @entity196 , was in charge of reconstructing the interior of the aircraft cabin for @entity19 from debris recovered from the ocean			0
@entity202 , an accident investigator for the @entity176 who appears in the documentary , inspects damage after the crash			0
right , part of the plane 's wing is seen in the water off @entity24 officials have dismissed allegations of a cover - up , saying evidence strongly points to their conclusion @entity196 said the board ' completely discounted ' the accounts of more than 200 witnesses who say they saw a streak of light heading toward the plane before it broke apart			1
@entity196 said the plane 's reconstructed fuselage - which reporters were allowed to view after the briefing - has holes consistent with what would be expected from missile shrapnel			1
reporters were not able to see the holes , he said , because they were on the opposite side of the reconstructed plane , facing away from the board 's briefing area			2
@entity196 offered no explanation why his former colleagues would deliberately ignore important evidence			0
' as far as motivation , who did what and why , we did n't get into that			0
' but officials at the briefing and other former @entity19 investigators said an examination of witness statements showed that what people thought might be a missile was actually the trajectory of the plane after the fiery explosion , the force of which broke off some pieces of the aircraft while much of the remainder of the plane was propelled up and forward , before plunging into the ocean			1
witnesses ' legitimately saw flames coming down and everything else , and explosions , but it occurred after the initial center fuel tank explosion , ' @entity266 , who recently retired as head of @entity19 's aviation office and was a senior investigator during the flight 800 investigation , said in an interview			1
the documentary airs on the @entity275 premium television channel			0
the documentary , @entity2 , premieres on july 17 at @entity277 on cable network @entity275 an image shows the reconstructed section of the plane			0
although 90 per cent of the aircraft was recovered , only the section around the central fuel tank was reconstructed			1

federal officials who investigated crash say they stand by conclusion
@entity19 held briefing for reporters
@entity293 crash was caused by overheated fuel tank vapors and not missile
documentary claims investigation was subject to government cover - up
