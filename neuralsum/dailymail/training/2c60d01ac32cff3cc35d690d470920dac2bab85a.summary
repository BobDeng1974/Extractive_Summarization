@entity0 left it late at the @entity2 to deny @entity3 a famous home win against @entity6 's stuttering side			1
@entity7 fired the hosts into the lead with his first goal this season , however @entity0 equalised early in the second half			1
much maligned midfielder @entity13 came on at the break to score a spectacular equaliser within minutes of the restart			1
@entity17 broke clear of @entity0 's shaky backline to send the @entity3 ahead again , but summer signing @entity19 denied them the three points with a low strike with just three minutes left of play			1
he made a decent save from @entity31 , then twice denied @entity32			2
no chance with @entity13 ’s thunderbolt			1
@entity35 - 7 showed a calm head to pick out @entity7 for his goal and worked tirelessly up and down the right flank			1
not only did he provide an attacking outlet but a solid defensive screen			2
@entity42 - 7 @entity3 rejected two bids from @entity44 in the summer and the former @entity45 under 21 international is beginning to show why			1
from fourth - choice centre back to vital member of the team			2
centre back @entity49 failed to prevent @entity13 scoring at the start of the second - half @entity49 - 7 out - muscled by @entity13 for his goal , but provided plenty more to counter-balance			1
there were timely interceptions to crosses and a calm authority to his play			2
@entity61 - 6 dependable as usual at left - back without doing much spectacular			2
has been the only foreign summer signing to feature in @entity26 ’s team consistently and he does provide balance			2
@entity66 - 7 threw himself in front of shots as the minutes ticked down and provided a solid core to @entity3 ’s team			1
restricted his running forward to ensure the hosts maintained their shape			2
@entity74 - 6 did not quite have the impact of recent games , where he has been one of @entity3 ’s best players , but did all the basics well			1
@entity3 midfielder , shielding off @entity80 , worked tirelessly for the home side on the right wing @entity84 - 7.5 full of energy and clever link - up play throughout			1
prepared to work hard for the cause , which coming from a right winger is priceless			2
has turned around his @entity2 career after being frozen out last season			2
@entity3 striker @entity7 celebrates scoring a fine opener after just eight minutes @entity7 - 7 stunning strike to set the mood and ensure @entity3 had the initiative for most of the match			1
sometimes slack in possession but makes up for it when delivering decisive moments			2
@entity100 - 6.5 lovely pass with his ‘ wrong ’ foot to set clear @entity17			1
the weight and direction were judged precisely and allowed his team - mate the time to compose his thoughts			0
such a sweet left foot , too			0
@entity109 star @entity17 was once again a nuisance for @entity0 , firing @entity3 2 - 1 up @entity17 - 7 growing into his role as @entity3 ’s go - to guy			1
there was little doubt he would convert when bearing down on @entity117 and the finish against a goalkeeper capable of unfathomable saves was inch - perfect			0
substitutes @entity122 - ( 86 ' ) @entity0 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity123 - 6 had little to do other than pick the ball out of his net			1
two shots on target , two goals			0
neither one could the @entity130 have done anything about			0
@entity132 - 6 not kicked on in the manner that was hoped when he first broke into the @entity0 team as a teenager			1
there are just too many mistakes			0
always a willing runner going forwards and a tenacious tackler but he did not shine here			0
@entity0 defender @entity141 returned to the side from injury and was kept busy by @entity3 @entity141 - 6 the better of @entity0 ’s centre - halves but that is not saying much			1
making his return after six weeks out injured so rustiness may be a problem but displayed little of the authority needed			0
@entity151 - 5 just does not look like a centre - back			0
lacks the stature required and on this evidence the knowledge as well			0
too often he appeared uncertain and his positing is open to question			0
@entity80 - 5 at fault for the opening goal			2
got sucked into @entity27 ’s long ball but beaten in the air by @entity84 to leave huge space on the right flank for wisdom to run into			1
better going forward as the game went on			0
@entity19 was given the tough task of shielding @entity0 's defence but also managed to score @entity19 - 7 given the tough task of screening @entity0 ’s defence against a vibrant @entity3 attack and looked lost for the opening goal			1
but redeemed himself in the second half and provided an equaliser of great quality			0
@entity177 - 5.5 hooked at half - time and seemingly not fully fit after his rib injury , which he was wearing a corset under his shirt to protect			0
pressed high at times but failed to impose himself on the ball			0
@entity186 winger @entity185 was given a first start in the league by @entity6 but struggled to impose himself @entity185 - 5.5 given his first start in the @entity29 by @entity6 , he operated on the right wing as opposed to the central role that had been expected			0
glittering moments were scarce , however			0
@entity193 - 6 failed to get into the game in any meaningful way			0
handed his preferred role behind the striker but too frequently his involvement slowed moves down			0
possesses magic to turn matches but did not show it here			0
@entity32 was once again a threat for @entity0 , adding a fourth assist to his three goals so far @entity32 - 7 subdued for his standards			1
his cross for @entity13 ’s goal was good and there were the usual cracked shot from distance			1
but substituted before the end to suggest his fitness is not at peak capacity			0
@entity217 - 6 smacked a superb volley into the post to give us a glimpse of the player who won @entity0 their 20th league title but in this sole striker role his fading ability is exposed			1
needs a partner running off him			0
not mobile enough on his own			0
@entity13 roars in delight after scoring his first league goal for @entity0 to equalise at the @entity2 substitutes @entity13 - 7 having made an instant impact off the bench , @entity13 produced a fine goal and put in an industrious display to silence his doubters			1
@entity236 - ( 72 ' ) 6 @entity186 - ( 76 ' )			0

@entity7 scored his first of the season after eight minutes
@entity13 made an instant impact with his first @entity0 goal
@entity17 lead the line well for @entity3 and scored a fine effort
@entity84 put in an industrious display for the @entity3 on the right
