they are currently investigating historic sex abuse allegations that came to light following publicity surrounding @entity37 , the inquiry into sex offences committed by @entity8			2
in the era before the internet , paedophiles used secret magazines or groups to share their crimes with fellow sex attackers in the same way some use internet forums now			0
criminologists believe that the wall could be an example of such behaviour			0
‘ it is a boasting system , ’ said @entity52 , professor of criminology at @entity54			0
‘ paedophiles are constantly evolving ways of communicating			0
it is a form of saying , “ this is what i ’ve done , i ’ve done more than you ”			0
it ’s about them displaying their own sexual success in being able to abuse these children			0
’ police denied claims that the flat was used by @entity69 or that the names amounted to a list of his victims			1

investigation : @entity32 discovered the names after a tip - off they received ' as a result of @entity37 ' ‘ it is important to stress these allegations were not about @entity8 himself and @entity32 is not carrying out any inquiries directly relating to @entity100			1
‘ the recovery of these names came as a result of an ongoing investigation into the allegations made last year ’			1
‘ this is a live , complex investigation for which we have already made arrests therefore i can not go into great detail about the status of the investigation			0
’ @entity8 ’s death , aged 84 in october 2011 , prompted a wave of allegations against the former @entity117 presenter			0
