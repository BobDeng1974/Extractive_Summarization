tv presenter @entity0 has posted a series of hilarious pictures of unrecognisable celebrity waxworks on his @entity5 page after a trip to a museum – but can you work out who they are supposed to represent without peeking at the name tags ? mr @entity0 , 54 , and his family visited the @entity14 's @entity13 in @entity15 , @entity16 , in @entity17 over the weekend			1
in one tweet he wrote : ‘ it 's almost like @entity17 want to start a war			0
here 's the @entity27 ... ’ with a picture of a waxwork with only the faintest passing resemblance to her majesty			2
’ the building houses more than 100 ‘ true - to - life ’ wax figures in 16 themed galleries			0
the collection features both the famous and the infamous , including film stars , politicians and religious figures along with well - known musicians			0
guests have the opportunity to sit on @entity58 's couch , jump into bed with @entity60 and @entity61 , and even measure up to @entity62			0
this waxwork 's expression ( left ) suggests he recently saw @entity66 kissing @entity67 , while ( right ) is one of the more life - like figures this waxwork ( left ) had meticulously parted hair in real life			2
some say ( right ) was the most accurate @entity74 of all time - but which one is it ? this smiley waxwork ( left ) does n't look particularly regal , while this religious leader ( right ) is a little more recognisable thanks to his glasses why the long face ? as the gun and bow tie suggest , this figure ( left ) is another @entity74 - while ( right ) is an emaciated version of a former pm she 's not looking too pretty ! the actress ( left ) represents would definitely runaway , while these screen legends are looking worse for wear two famous @entity92 talk show hosts - but who 's who ? clue : one is the longest - serving late night talk show host in tv history @entity14 was the great - grandson of @entity97 , creator of the @entity99 wax museums			1
he worked at @entity99 museum as a wax figure sculptor but eventually left and set up on his own			2
he founded a waxwork museum in @entity104 ’s @entity103 in 1890 , which was destroyed in a fire just a year later			0
@entity14 's waxwork museum in @entity107 , which closed in october 2012 , was described as the world 's worst waxworks museum because so many of its models looked nothing like the people they were supposed to represent			1
his museums are not connected to his great - grandmother 's @entity99 waxwork museums			1
the @entity15 attraction has mixed reviews on trip advisor , with many guests complaining they needed to read the name tags in order to identify who the waxworks were supposed to represent			1
@entity125 has contacted the museum for a comment			0
the museum 's manager , @entity128 , said : ' we had a great time ' was one of his reply tweets			2
wax figures and their likenesses are always subject to everyones own individual perception and interpretation of wax celebrities			0
' we do look to provide our guests with a rare opportunity to experience and get up close , and take an interactive photo with over 150 wax figures of some of the world 's top celebrities			0
' @entity14 's has been open since 1957 in @entity15 and we have entertained millions of guests and families for over 60 years and we will continue to do so			1
