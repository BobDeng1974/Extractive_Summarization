by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 08:03 est , 26 march 2013 scientists are planning to intentionally smash a spacecraft into a huge asteroid in 2022 to see inside the rock			2
the @entity6 - led @entity5 ( @entity5 ) will launch in 2019			1
it will send two spacecraft — one built by @entity9 scientists and the other by the @entity11 — on a three - year voyage to the asteroid @entity14 at a cost of around £ 225million			1
the @entity6 - led @entity5 ( @entity5 ) will launch in 2019			2
it will send two spacecraft on a three - year voyage to the asteroid @entity17 the asteroid has been selected for the mission because it has ' no chance of hitting the earth ' making it perfect for this type of fact - finding missions			1
speaking at the 44th annual @entity27 , experts explained @entity14 is actually a binary asteroid system			0
it consists of two separate space rocks - the largest measuring 2,625 feet ( 800 metres ) across , and the smaller around 490 feet ( 150 m ) - which are bound together by gravity			0
the @entity33 mission will be carried out to give scientists a groundbreaking first look at a binary space rock system and hopefully reveal ways that dangerous asteroids which pose a possible risk to the earth can be deflected			1
the @entity11 is building the second @entity5 spacecraft - the @entity42 ( or @entity43 ) - which will observe the impact and collect data to properly understand the impact @entity5 scientist have timed the 2022 mission to coincide with a ' close approach ' by the @entity14 asteroids - meaning it will be about 6.8 million miles ( 11 million km ) from the @entity51 ,			1
should @entity52 spend millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money on space exploration ? @entity57 , of the @entity59 ' @entity58 in @entity60 , @entity56 is working on the @entity9 arms of the @entity5 project			0
he and his colleagues are building @entity64 ( @entity65 ) , one of the two spacecraft which will be involved in the mission			0
it will be launched into the smaller @entity33 asteroid while travelling at 14,000 mph ( 22,530 km / h )			0
the exact composition of the @entity72 asteroids is not yet known , but scientists hope once the spacecraft impacts , they will be able to measure how much the asteroid 's orbit is affected and ascertain its surface composition			2
@entity78 told the @entity79 it will create a crater during impact which will hopefully send the space rock off course - but just by a few millimetres			0
the @entity11 is building the second @entity5 spacecraft - the @entity42 ( or @entity43 ) - which will observe the impact and collect data to properly understand the impact			1
if the mission is successful , it could help inform space agencies around the world how to deflect larger , more threatening asteroid that could pose a threat to @entity51 , @entity78 added			0
the @entity5 mission 's @entity43 space craft is expected to cost about £ 127m ( $ 194 m ) , while the @entity64 spacecraft is slated to cost about £ 98million , mission officials said .			2

@entity5 ( @entity5 ) to launch 2019
it will send two spacecraft on a three - year voyage to the asteroid @entity17
could show how ' dangerous asteroids can be deflected from hitting earth '
