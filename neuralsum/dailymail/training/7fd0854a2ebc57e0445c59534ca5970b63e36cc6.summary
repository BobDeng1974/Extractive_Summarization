by @entity0 @entity1 has contacted the police to report an assault after having coloured powder thrown at him during a @entity7 festival			1
the former @entity8 mp turned television presenter , 49 , was filming a segment for the @entity12 government owned @entity13 outside a college in @entity15 in @entity16 when three young men threw the substance at him before running away			1
despite powder - throwing being an integral part of the ancient @entity23 festival of @entity24 , mr @entity1 told @entity25 that he did not believe the men were taking part in the celebrations and said he saw ' no benign cultural or religious significance ' to the ' shocking ' and ' unprovoked ' attack			1
attack : @entity1 had coloured powder thrown at him during a religious festival today mr @entity1 said he believed the three men who carried out the 2pm assault were ' white males in their late teens or early 20s ' , adding that he did not know what their motivation was			1
he said onlookers were left stunned by the attack , adding that although students celebrating @entity24 in the area , ' there was no doubt that it was nothing whatsoever to do with the religious and cultural celebration going on at the time			1
' ' there 's absolutely no possibility whatsoever that they though that i or anyone else in that particular locality had anything to do with the powder - throwing element of the religious ceremony , ' he added			2
mr @entity1 said he felt the attack was ' entirely opportunistic ' and had been designed either to attack him either for political reasons , because he is a recognisable figure , or in order to disrupt the filming			1
' people not known to me all unanimously agreed that it was a shocking incident , ' he added			0
mr @entity1 said that although some of the powder went in to his eye , there was no lasting effect and he did not not require medical assistance			1
fun : powder - throwing is an integral part of the ancient @entity23 festival of @entity24 and is celebrated by students from @entity76 and the @entity77 ( pictured ) describing the substance , mr @entity1 told @entity25 : ' quite possibly the powder they used was the same powder being used for the religious festival , but it was n't being used in that context			1
' ' it was being used because either they recognised me , or they recognised what i was doing , and they decided to play a rather stupid and ill - considered prank			0
' @entity24 is an ancient spring festival in the @entity7 calender that is also known as ' @entity92 ' or ' @entity93 '			1
although primarily observed in @entity23 and @entity95 , the celebrations have attracted revelers from around the world in recent years thanks to the bright colours and joyful atmosphere			0
the colour aspect of the festival is believed to come from an ancient @entity7 legend that @entity104 was worried the fair - skinned deity @entity106 would not love him due to his blue skin			1
despairing of her son , the legend says @entity104 's mother @entity109 allows him to change @entity106 's skin colour to whatever he chooses			0
one key aspect in the @entity24 celebrations is the large ' carnival of the colour ' that takes place on the morning after the @entity118 bonfire			2
during the carnival , worshipers chase each other and throw coloured powder , paint and water balloons			2
everyone near the carnival is considered fair game , with revelers often attacking strangers and the elderly with the coloured paint			0
it is believed that students from @entity133 at @entity76 and the @entity77 had organised @entity24 celebrations in the @entity15 area when mr @entity1 's assault took place			1
' i ca n't be sure of their motivations - i 'm simply sure their motivations were n't to embrace me in the religious celebrations going on at the time , ' he added			2
mr @entity1 said the police agreed with him that an assault had taken place and said a number of witnesses came forward to assist to assist the investigation			1
however @entity151 said their investigation has already been closed ' pending the receipt of any new information '			2
mr @entity1 said that his @entity13 team , who had been filming a section for mr @entity1 's weekly half - hour programme , had lost the entire day 's filming as a result of the attack			1
' you ca n't film when you 're covered in paint			0
people will think you 're some kind of an art installation or that i 'm making some kind of an artistic statement			0
it may have won me a @entity172 award but it was n't going to win me a @entity173 , ' he told @entity25			0
in the aftermath of the attack , mr @entity1 said : ' i think @entity176 € ™ m known for having a sense of humour but frankly this kind of thing is incomprehensibly stupid			1
i wonder if the people who did it will think it was funny enough to deserve the convictions which they are likely to get as a result			0
' mr @entity1 went on to liken the attack on him the incident when then prime minister @entity188 had purple paint thrown at him in the @entity190 by a @entity192 protester			1
' i think any politician who was in the chamber at the time they the powder at @entity188 has still go a chilling recollection of that			0
because that could have been anything			0
' ' no one in @entity201 could accuse me of being humourless and not being able to laugh at myself , but that 's not the issue			0
the issue is that this kind of behaviour is at least is utterly stupid , and at worst could cause long term harm ... where do you draw the boundaries ? , ' mr @entity1 said			1
the attack on mr @entity1 took place as students from @entity76 the @entity213 ( pictured ) gathered in nearby @entity214 for a three hour event to celebrate @entity24 ( file image ) @entity1 's career as a @entity8 mp was often as remarkable for his cartoonish behaviour and well - known girlfriends than his political achievements			1
@entity221 - born @entity1 became member of parliament for @entity223 in @entity224 in 1997 , becoming leader of the @entity226 in 2001			2
in four successive @entity8 leadership contests , @entity1 backed campaigns that collapsed , leading to talk of the ' curse of @entity1 ' , and making his support for a prospective leader undesirable			2
@entity1 's career as an mp was often as remarkable for his well - known girlfriends ( left with @entity234 weather forecaster @entity233 , and right with cheeky girl @entity235 ) than for his political achievements on 13 april 1998 @entity1 came close to death in a near fatal paragliding accident , falling 80 feet onto a @entity226 mountain in his constituency , and breaking his back in 12 places			2
@entity1 was in a relationship with @entity234 weather presenter @entity233 for a number of years in the 2000s , with the couple coming close to marrying			0
however they split in october 2006 , with @entity248 later blaming ' women and alcohol ' and @entity1 's ' rowdy , drunken behaviour ' for the split			0
@entity1 later started a relationship with then - 24 - year - old @entity235 of pop music double - act @entity235			1
he announced their engagement after proposing in @entity257 , but the couple split in late 2008 after a ' difficult period '			0
while serving as an mp , @entity1 made regular appearances on comedic television programmes - chiefly have i got news for you			2

vowing to take up comedy instead of politics , @entity1 made his debut as a stand - up at the @entity280 in @entity16 's @entity281 two months after losing his seat hi show was described by one audience member as ' not fantastic , but not completely awful ' , although a resulting tour saw increasingly small audience numbers			1
two years later @entity1 put himself forward to be the @entity226 ' nominee for mayor of @entity16 but was knocked out in the first round , receiving only 252 votes			2
the wrestling promoter said @entity1 lasted two minutes in the ring and was taken to hospital with minor injuries following the disappointment , @entity1 's next attempt to break into the entertainment industry saw him take part in a wrestling match against professional fighter @entity268			0
according to the promoter , @entity1 lasted about two minutes in the ring before being taken to hospital with minor injuries			0
@entity1 has since appeared on numerous reality television programmes , including @entity303 , @entity304 , and i 'm a celebrity ... @entity306 ! mr @entity1 said he wanted to meet his attackers to ask them why they carried out the attack in the hope of proving it had nothing to do with the @entity7 festival of @entity24			1
' through the pages of the @entity314 i would like to extend an invitation to the people who did this			0
if you want to claim this was part of the celebrations , come meet me and explain it to me			0
' ' i will be happy to listen - with a @entity314 reporter on hand to ensure fairness - i would be happy to listen to why you thought it was a reasonable thing to do			0
' the attack on mr @entity1 took place as students from @entity76 and the @entity77 gathered in nearby @entity214 for a three hour event to celebrate @entity24			1
