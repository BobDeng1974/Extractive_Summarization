making progress : the @entity4 's top anti-terror police officer , @entity10 , ( left ) has said today that ' significant progress ' has been made in the hunt for the @entity4 jihadist who murdered @entity9 journalist @entity8 ( right ) today mr @entity10 , the @entity4 's leading counter-terrorism officer , said : ' every reasonable person in the country has been touched by the pitiless murder of @entity8 at the hands of @entity21 terrorists , and the murderer 's apparent @entity4 nationality has focused attention on extremism in the @entity4 as well as the @entity40			1
investigators are making significant progress			0
' he appealed to family members and friends of would - be @entity4 terrorists to come forward , stressing that nearly half of potential jihadis identified as part of @entity50 - linked investigations had not previously been classed as dangerous			1
mr @entity10 said that counter terrorism police had recently arrested a 19 - year - old man in @entity53 , who was charged with engaging in conduct of preparation for terrorist acts , and is now awaiting trial			1
he added : ' another young man , previously unknown of as a terrorist risk , was arrested last week on suspicion of planning to leave the country to travel to @entity50 for terrorist acts			2
shocking : @entity21 terrorists posted a video online last week of the horrifying murder of hostage mr @entity8 at the hands of a killer who spoke with a @entity4 accent ' the biggest growth in @entity50 related investigations has occurred in @entity73 and the @entity74			1
the growth of dangerous individuals poses challenges for policing , especially when nearly half of @entity50 travellers of concern were not known as terrorist risks previously			2
' in the first half of this year 69 suspected extremists who planned to travel to @entity50 or fund terrorism there were arrested , and five times as many suspects are being arrested now compared to 2013			1
' high priority operations , especially against those involved in attack planning or on the cusp have increased greatly , ' he said			0
' @entity94 stops and cash seizures have grown by over 50per cent as we strive to disrupt terrorists			0
' the biggest growth in @entity50 - related investigations has occurred in @entity73 and the @entity74			0
the growth of dangerous individuals poses challenges for policing , especially when nearly half of @entity50 travellers of concern were not known as terrorist risks previously			2
journalist : mr @entity8 pictured working in @entity50 in august 2012			1
mr @entity10 described the death as ' pitiless ' ' hence , we appeal to the public to help identify for us aspiring terrorists - they may be about to travel abroad , have just returned or be showing signs of becoming radicalised			1
' @entity110 investigators are currently having hundreds of pieces of terrorist content linked to @entity50 removed from websites including @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
mr @entity10 said the force is also trying to prevent hate crimes here that may be sparked by events abroad , for example anti-semitic offences related to @entity123 and crimes against @entity125 over the actions of @entity21			2
he added : " there is a lot at stake			0
in addition to the public assistance in identifying potential terrorists , we all need community and religious leaders to continue to speak out against warped narratives and we need everyone to ensure that public debate does not give oxygen to the terrorists by giving them the publicity they seek			0
' earlier this month @entity110 chief sir @entity143 warned it can not be predicted when potential terrorists might decide to return to the @entity4 from countries such as @entity19 and @entity50 , and police are preparing in case of an influx			1
it is estimated that around 500 @entity4 have travelled to @entity50 to fight alongside extremists there , of whom around half are thought to be from @entity73			1
however , during a visit to @entity155 deputy prime minister @entity154 rejected calls for tougher measures to combat the threat posed by returning @entity4 jihadists			0
anger : @entity73 mayor @entity161 ( right ) said he wants mr @entity8 's murderer , who has become known as ' @entity163 ' ( left ) to be killed in a bomb attack @entity73 mayor @entity161 said he wants mr @entity8 's murderer to be killed in a bomb attack and joined the growing calls for @entity4 fighting abroad to be stripped of their citizenship			2
but mr @entity154 said : ' we actually have a number of measures already on the statute book which allow us to keep a very close eye on those people who are n't in prison , are n't sentenced , but nonetheless are perceived to be a threat to the @entity4			2
' and of course , we will continue to review all the powers on the recommendation of the police and security services that may be deemed to be necessary to deal with this very serious issue			0
' i sometimes wish it was as simple as @entity161 implies : all we need to do is pass a law and everything will be well			0
' writing in his @entity187 column , mr @entity161 said those who ' continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state ' should lose their @entity4 citizenship , and called for swift changes to the law so there is a " rebuttable presumption " that those visiting war areas without notifying the authorities have done so for a terrorist purpose			2
he wrote : ' young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in ' battle ' they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins			0
' many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to " black - eyed virgins " is in fact a promise of 72 raisins			0
' i suspect most of us do n't give a monkey 's what happens to this prat in heaven , whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible			0
