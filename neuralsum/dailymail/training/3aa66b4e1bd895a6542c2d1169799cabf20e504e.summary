millions of us spend our days slaving over a keyboard			1
but lurking between the keys , hidden on the mouse and nestled in your phone lies more than 10 million bacteria - 400 times more than on the average toilet seat			1
unhygienic working conditions are a ' key contributor ' to the 131 million working days lost each year in the @entity10 and millions more around the world , to illnesses including colds and flu			1
bacteria and viruses can multiply on hard surfaces , remaining infectious for up to 24 hours , hygiene expert and visiting professor at the @entity20 , dr @entity21 told @entity22			1
she said the average desk is a prime breeding ground for infections , before urging people to disinfect their desks , telephones , keyboards and computer mice			1
she added that better cleaning and hygiene measures could result in ' significantly fewer sick days '			2
now , a new infographic lays bare the stark reality of how important it is to detox your desk			2
it shows one in five workers fail to clean their workspace before eating , while two in three eat lunch at their desk			2
twenty per cent of people never clean their computer mouse , while around 80 per cent of common infections are transmitted by touch			0
' the slightest cough or sneeze into our hands and the germs start their journey through the office			2
' and if somebody does n't wash their hands the bacteria or viruses can get on your hands , even if you			1
' she said if one member of the office fails to wash their hands , their colleagues can pick up their bacteria by touching the same door handles and surfaces			1
those organisms then risk being transferred when people touch their eyes or mouths , causing colds , coughs , flu , norovirus and food poisoning			0
' any surfaces your hands come into contact with are potential breeding grounds for bacteria and viruses , ' dr @entity21 said			1
' from the moment you touch the toilet flush and cubicle door handle , you are at risk of picking up bacteria			0
' even the soap dispenser can pose a threat			0
even if you thoroughly wash your hands , if you touch the door handle on the way out , and it 's been touched by someone who has n't washed their hands you will pick up any residue bacteria			2
' these organisms are completely invisible			0
that is why it is so important everyone takes responsibility for their own personal hand hygiene			0
it is really important to wash your hands			0
' she said a recent survey found nearly 50 per cent of office workers do n't wash their hands after going to the toilet			2
' there is no excuse , ' she said			0
' those people bypassing the sink are spreading germs all around the office			0
' their refusal to wash their hands means someone else is likely to pick up that bacteria , and risk passing it into their bodies when touching their eyes , mouths or faces			2
' cleaning in offices should really focus on any surfaces that come into contact with anyone 's hands			1
it is important to mop the floors , but really it is desks , sinks , handles , anywhere we put our hands - they are the surfaces that are likely to be really dirty			2
' we have all got a responsibility			0
' dr @entity21 said past studies have found more than 3,000 organisms per square inch on a keyboard , and more than 1,600 on a computer mouse			1
she said 16 per cent of people carry norovirus , which causes vomiting and diarrhoea , but show no symptoms			0
' so you may feel perfectly fine and well , but you 're carrying around the virus and spreading it around the office , ' dr @entity21 said			1
hygiene expert dr @entity21 , a visiting professor at @entity20 , told @entity22 ' our hands are a germ motorway ' picking up harmful organisms which cause colds , flu and norovirus , and spreading them around their desk			1
pictured in green is bacteria on a desk she said washing your hands is key to cutting down on sick days caused by common colds picked up from your desk , and an anti-bacterial disinfectant spray is ideal to kill off the bacteria and viruses , that can live for up to 24 hours on hard surfaces she recommended using a hand sanitiser after leaving the bathroom , and over the course of the day			1
and advised using anti-bacterial disinfectant sprays to clean your desk			0
' simple hygiene measures can make a marked difference to reducing the spread of bacteria and viruses in the work - place , ' she told @entity22			1
' employees should wash their hands when arriving at work , particularly if they have been on public transport			0
' office equipment such as telephone handsets , computer keyboards and desks , which are hotspots for viruses and bacteria , and other hard surfaces in regular contact with hands should be cleaned and disinfected regularly using anti-viral and anti-bacterial products such as @entity209 which will help to reduce the risk of picking up colds and flu			1
' but , she said , one of the most effective ways to stop infection is as simple as washing hands			0
dr @entity21 said around half of illnesses can be reduced by people religiously washing their hands during the day , not just after going to the toilet , but also before eating			1
and just 20 seconds of hand washing can stop the journey of the germ			0
ensuring the hands are thoroughly dry after a wash is important too , she added .			0

more than 10 million bacteria lurk on the average office desk with 7,500 organisms hidden in your keyboard
unhygienic working conditions are a ' key contributor ' to millions of working days lost to sickness each year
hygiene expert dr @entity21 said bacteria and viruses can survive on hard surfaces for up to 24 hours
says our hands are a germ motorway ; many surfaces they come into contact with can breed bacteria and viruses
