by @entity0 published : 04:02 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 12 june 2013 fresh calls have been made to quash a death penalty handed out to a double killer because the jury in his trial was told black men were more violent			0
@entity8 , 51 , was convicted in @entity9 of killing his ex-girlfriend and a man in her apartment in july 1995 and has been on death row since			1
while his guilt is not being questioned , @entity8 's lawyers say the jury was unfairly influenced and that he should receive a new sentencing hearing			1
psychologist dr @entity28 , who had been called by @entity8 's defense lawyer to testify about his future threat to society , testified to this under cross-examination by the prosecutor			1
he was asked : ' you have determined that the sex factor , that a male is more violent than a female because that ’s just the way it is , and that the race factor , black increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons ; is that correct ? ' dr @entity28 said : ' yes			0
' the @entity22 halted the execution and the justices said they would review an appeal in his case			0
in a new documentary on the case , @entity51 , director of the criminal justice project for the @entity54 legal defense fund , said : ' it ’s a stunning and outrageous case			0
' you have someone condemned to die because he is @entity60			0
' @entity8 's case is one of six convictions that then @entity9 attorney general @entity68 - a political ally of @entity23 who is now a @entity67 @entity64 senator - reviewed in 2000 and said needed to be reopened because of the racial reference			1
@entity8 's attorneys appealed to the @entity22 and @entity9 governor @entity23 to block the execution , saying a psychologist testified that black people were more likely to commit violence @entity51 , director of the criminal justice project for the @entity54 legal defense fund , said : ' it 's a stunning and outrageous case ' in custody : @entity8 has been on death row since his conviction in 1995 in the other five cases , new punishment hearings were held and each convict again was sentenced to die			1
state attorneys contend @entity8 's case was different from the others and that the racial reference was a small part of larger testimony about prison populations			2
@entity23 is a capital punishment supporter and as frontrunner for the @entity67 presidential nomination his actions now are coming under closer scrutiny			0
the reprieve from the nation 's highest court came nearly two hours into a six - hour window when @entity8 could have been taken to the death chamber			2
@entity8 was convicted of gunning down ex-girlfriend @entity97 , 32 , and @entity99 , 33 , outside @entity100 on july , 30 , 1995 , a week after @entity8 and @entity101 broke up			1
a third person , @entity8 's stepsister , @entity102 , also was wounded , though she has since forgiven @entity8 and sought for his death sentence to be commuted to life in prison			2
@entity8 's attorneys went to the @entity22 after losing appeals in lower @entity108 clemency request to the @entity109 , all of whom are @entity23 appointees , also failed			0
now former governor @entity116 , prosecutor in the case @entity118 , members of the @entity9 legislature and retired prosecutors and judges are petitioning the @entity119 for a new sentencing hearing			1
mr @entity116 has also narrated a new documentary on the case called a @entity123 in @entity9 : race , the @entity125 and the @entity126 .			0
