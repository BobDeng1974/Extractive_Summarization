a two - week - long partial government shutdown originally blamed on a conservative @entity3 ' demands for @entity4 to be defunded is now stalling because @entity5 want to see an end to planned spending cuts , it emerged today			1
@entity8 has consistently insisted that he is not willing to pay a @entity3 ' ransom ' as the deadlock continued but the reversal will see many @entity12 wondering who 's the real aggressor in the fiscal ' hostage - taking ' that the @entity16 has decried for nearly a month			1
a budget impasse earlier in the year led to the so - called budget ' sequester ' which walled off tens of billions of dollars in planned spending			2
now @entity22 @entity5 are demanding its complete rollback , in an audacious move that many in the @entity26 are seeing as a greedy overreach			1
hard to swallow : republicans will be angered by the bold demand from the @entity5 after @entity8 , pictured at a foodbank in @entity31 today			1
has for the last month said he would not pay a ' ransom ' federal government workers are tired of being furloughed because of the 13 - day - old partial shutdown , but @entity22 @entity5 have scuttled a hoped - for solution with new demands that would see @entity38 breaking the bank with new spending records the @entity16 issued a statement on monday saying that @entity8 would remind congressional leaders in the @entity43 at 3pm that he ' will not pay a ransom for @entity45 reopening the government and raising the debt limit			1
' that meeting was postponed about 20 minutes before it was scheduled to begin			0
the @entity16 released a statement saying the action was taken ' to allow leaders in the @entity22 time to continue making important progress towards a solution that raises the debt limit and reopens the government			1
some observers are saying the hastily scheduled meeting will be a session of liars ' poker whose stakes are half fiscal and half political			0
' this whole shutdown has been completely unnecessary , ' @entity8 told reporters during an unscheduled stop monday afternoon at a @entity66 , @entity31 soup kitchen , complaining that '' we 've seen this brinksmanship time and time again to try and extract extreme partisan concessions			1
' on saturday , leading senators from both parties were poised to announce a deal based on a proposal from @entity75 sen. @entity74 , a moderate @entity3			0
the plan called for a debt - ceiling extension through the end of january and a six - month federal budget agreement at levels set by the january sequester			1
also included were a two - year delay of the controversial medical - device tax under @entity4 , and a mechanism to verify the incomes of @entity12 claiming @entity4 - related subsidies			2
then , according to @entity87 @entity86 sen. @entity86 , @entity5 ' moved the goalposts in light of ... polling data ' that showed they could extract more concessions from @entity3 senators – in addition to the collapse of ' defund ' and ' delay ' @entity4 demands			1
' we were ready to go to the press gallery ' to announce a deal , @entity86 said sunday on @entity101 ' @entity103 program			0
' the @entity105 leadership said no. ' the always - understated @entity106 told @entity108 's @entity107 on the @entity110 program that she was ' very surprised ' to see @entity112 senate majority leader @entity111 reject her plan at the last minute			0
' i do n't think it was very constructive , ' she said			0
@entity3 senate minority leader @entity116 was more pointed , noting in a statement sunday that @entity111 had already succeeded in forcing @entity16 @entity3 to abandon their immediate hope of seeing @entity4 gutted			1
' it 's time for @entity105 leaders to take " yes " for an answer , ' @entity119 said			0
sen. @entity74 ( @entity124 ) is steamed that @entity5 have shot down her grand bargain , but it 's sen. @entity86 ( r ) who seems more animated , saying liberals have ' moved the goalposts ' and shifted the debate from @entity4 to new spending hikes @entity22 @entity132 have been basing their negotiations on the idea that annual federal spending would be capped at $ 967 billion , the number resulting from january 's sequester cuts			1
in the @entity16 , the @entity26 has aimed at a slightly higher number – $ 988 billion – which was proposed last year by then - vice presidential candidate @entity139 , the @entity140 chairman of the @entity141			1
@entity142 now say they want a budget that spends $ 1.058 trillion , even as president @entity8 claims to be presiding over a federal government in which annual deficits have steadily decreased			1
@entity12 senate minority leader @entity116 says he 's tired of making concessions and getting still more demands in return " ' it 's time for @entity105 leaders to take " yes " for an answer ' the result has left some @entity3 in the @entity16 feeling like they ca n't trust the @entity22 to shoot straight			1
' this is getting ridiculous , ' a senior @entity16 @entity26 aide told @entity154 on monday			2
' i hate to think our own guys in the @entity22 are jerking us around , but it 's clear that at least the @entity142 are			0
i think they 're reaching too far			0
and if @entity22 @entity3 follow them off a cliff , we 're not going to reach out a hand to pull them back this time			2
' sen. @entity162 of @entity163 told reporters on sunday that he 's confident @entity5 will get most of what they want			2
. ' we are not overplaying our hand , ' @entity162 said			0
' we are open to discussion in every way , and i think our @entity3 colleagues are moving in our direction			0
' some in the @entity26 are quietly saying they would accept a rollback of the sequester - related cuts – principally those connected to defense spending – but only if they were matched dollar - for - dollar by new cuts in entitlement spending			1
@entity5 say that 's a non-starter			2
and even if the two sides in the @entity22 should reach a compromise , there 's no telling how the more conservative @entity132 would view it			0
@entity162 said sunday that the impasse could last awhile : ' we 're not going to overcome it in the next day or two			0
' @entity26 sen. @entity189 left a meeting with @entity16 speaker @entity191 on saturday , ready to do battle in the @entity194 talk wars			2
' you own @entity4 , ' he would tell @entity5 , ' and it ¿ s going to be a political gift that keeps on giving ' republicans , meanwhile , have seized on the 2013 sequester budget cuts and their underlying 2011 budget law in the same way @entity5 have defended the @entity202 – by insisting that it 's settled law			1
' it 's funny , " @entity26 senator @entity204 said sunday on @entity108			2
' they 're all about @entity4 being the law of the land , but so 's the sequester			2
if we exceed that , it 's real big step in the wrong direction			0
' @entity204 thinks it 's ' funny ' how @entity5 insist @entity4 is ' the law of the land ' but do n't treat the budget ' sequester ' with the same deference ' i ca n't imagine you 're going to get @entity22 @entity3 to vote for something that exceeds the sequester caps			1
i think it 's a huge mistake for the country			0
' @entity224 @entity223 senator @entity223 said on @entity225 that ' the @entity5 are on the verge of being one tick too cute as they see the @entity16 possibly in disarray			2
' lawmakers have precious few days left to talk turkey : treasury secretary @entity233 has warned that the federal government may not be able to pay its debt obligations as soon as thursday , unless @entity45 authorizes an increase in the debt ceiling			0
and while @entity3 are – so far – unwilling to give up political ground on spending , they have all but abandoned their earlier @entity4 - related demands which sparked the current debt and budget crises			1
@entity26 sen. @entity189 said sunday on @entity245 's @entity244 that @entity5 should be prepared to take responsibility for @entity4 's failures and , perhaps , for its eventual collapse			1
' to our @entity112 friends , ' he said , ' you own @entity4 , and it ’s going to be a political gift that keeps on giving			0
so the shutdown will be old news next year , @entity4 ’s faults will be front and center in 2014 – if we do n’t screw this up			0
' ' what breaks my heart is , [ in ] the last 12 days you ’ve had a complete meltdown of the portal called @entity4			0
the whole system [ is ] just not working			0
' and , he said with regret , by allowing themselves to be dragged into a sequester - related @entity268 of the budget crisis , @entity3 are ' overshadowing how badly @entity4 has been rolled out			1

@entity8 once complained that @entity3 were holding the @entity16 for ' ransom , ' but now it 's @entity5 who could bluff their way to *victory*
dems seek budget hikes on entitlement spending , and hope to win a short - term reopening of government to allow for a new negotiation soon
the @entity26 has all but abandoned its hope of rolling back @entity4 , and will likely only win token concessions as the debt - ceiling deadline looms
poll numbers show more of the public is blaming republicans than @entity5 for the partial shutdown , which kicked in oct. 1
