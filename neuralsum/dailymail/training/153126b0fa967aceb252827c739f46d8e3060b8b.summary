by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 woman has embarked on a 24,300 - nautical - mile journey with the hope of becoming the youngest woman to ever circumnavigate the globe in a single - engine aircraft - and her name just happens to be the same as another female aviator who famously tried to circle the planet 77 years ago			1
@entity13 took off thursday from @entity14 , @entity3 , in a single - engine @entity17 - @entity16 aircraft with co-pilot @entity19			0
the pair expects the journey around the globe to take 17 days with stops in 14 different countries			1
when she is in the air , about 80 percent of her flight will be over water , the majority of which is open ocean			1
however , @entity13 's family always thought they were distantly related to the famous aviator , and that is who the 31 - year - old @entity37 is named after			1
about 10 years ago , the contemporary @entity13 started taking aviation lessons with the hopes of living up to her famous name and flying around the world			1
a few years later , @entity13 learned she was not related to the famous pilot			2
' if you believe anything for 30 years and are told it 's not true , it 's tough to take , ' she told @entity57 prior to her flight on thursday			0
but @entity13 - who also flies a helicopter for her job as a traffic reporter - still admired her namesake , and vowed to complete a voyage similar to the one that presumably claimed the life of the fearless aviator			2
long flight : @entity13 and co-pilot @entity19 expect the journey to take about 17 days after years of aviation training , @entity13 began her journey thursday from the same @entity14 airfield where @entity37 started her doomed voyage nearly 80 years ago			1
' when i think about the feelings of opening up the hangar door on the morning of the flight and seeing the same view that @entity13 saw , it 's really special to me , ' she said			0
all aspects of the trip are n't the same , of course , and @entity13 says that her plane has state - of - the - art equipment that her namesake did n't have the luxury of enjoying during her tragic flight			2
' the reliability of a single - engine aircraft today in 2014 is vastly different than it was back in the 1930s , ' @entity13 told @entity92 @entity91 radio station 90.9 @entity94 's " @entity95 " program			0
' so , while there is still a component of adventure with any flight over water , i felt most connected to the @entity17			0
it ’s a beautiful aircraft			0
the cockpit is absolutely state - of - the - art -- we ’ve got synthetic vision , we ’ve got dual gps			0
' training : @entity13 began her flight training 10 years ago and also flies a helicopter as a traffic reporter @entity13 plans to make stops in 14 different countries on her 17 - day trip to become the youngest woman to circle the globe in a single - engine airplane despite the fact that they share no familial ancestors , @entity13 says recreating the journey will help her connect with her namesake - and hopefully inspire others			1
' by recreating and symbolically completing @entity37 ’s flight around the world , i hope to develop an even deeper connection to my namesake and also encourage the world to pursue their own adventures , ' the pilot wrote on the website set up to document her trip			2
' @entity13 believed that , ‘ adventure is worthwhile in itself ’ and it is that type of attitude that spurs us to seek the unknown , push our limits and fly outside the lines			0
' @entity13 's journey can be tracked minute - by - minute on her website .			1

@entity37 grew up thinking she was related to the famed aviator who disappeared over the @entity38 in 1937
when she learned she and her namesake were not related , she vowed to still attempt to fly around the world
@entity13 's trip is expected to take 17 days with stops in 14 different countries
about 80 percent of her trip will be over water
@entity13 took off thursday from the same airfield where her namesake began her *fateful* journey 77 years ago
