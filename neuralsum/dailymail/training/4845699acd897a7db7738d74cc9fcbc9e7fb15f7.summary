parents who try to boost their children ’s development by regularly taking the lead with structured activities are in danger of actually stifling it , an expert warned yesterday			2
letting youngsters play alone helps them develop crucial skills which are linked to higher academic achievement and well - being , according dr @entity18			1
he was responding to a survey which found parents feel pressure to play one - to - one with their children and engage them in structured activities			1
sixty - three per cent thought one - to - one play would help their children develop new skills more quickly and 66 per cent worried they did n’t play with their offspring enough			1
but dr @entity18 , senior lecturer in psychology and education at @entity43 , warned that denying children time to explore alone could harm their development			1
‘ the really big concern over the last decade is the relative loss of opportunities for children to engage in child - led play , ’ he said			0
‘ children ’s lives are much more structured than they have ever been – and there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest this can be detrimental			0
parents can certainly be given guidelines about productive ways of playing with their children , but it ’s important that play is not structured all the time			2
’ letting youngsters play alone helps them develop crucial skills which are linked to higher academic achievement and well - being , according dr @entity18 ( file photo ) the survey of 1,100 parents with children aged from birth to three found 73 per cent felt pressure to ensure they develop at a certain pace			1
eighty per cent felt the need to fill their child ’s time with new activities to ensure they are always entertained			0
on average , children in the survey , commissioned by parenting website @entity82 in association with @entity85 , spent 5.4 hours a day playing – 2.3 hours directly with their parents and 1.9 independently			2
dr @entity18 urged parents to give children a range of experiences , both on their own , with peers and with parents			0
‘ research shows development of “ self - regulation abilities ” – which are predictive of academic achievement and emotional wellbeing – has a very strong link to the amount of time spent in child - led play , ’ he said			1
‘ children often have a purpose in their play when left alone – it is not just mucking about			0
