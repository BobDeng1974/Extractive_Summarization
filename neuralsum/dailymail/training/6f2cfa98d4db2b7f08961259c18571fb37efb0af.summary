@entity0 , pictured in 2013 , has been challenged about reporting in @entity1 during his time as a @entity4 correspondent @entity0 is facing new claims that he fabricated a story about witnessing the execution of four nuns in @entity1 during the country 's civil war			1
the allegations came days after liberal watchdog , @entity11 , questioned @entity0 's report that in 1977 he witnessed the suicide of a friend of @entity19 shooter @entity17 , and @entity20 disputed his coverage of the @entity22			1
@entity0 claimed he has ' seen guys gun down nuns in @entity1 ' and ' was in @entity1 and i saw nuns get shot in the back of the head ' while working at @entity4 , according to @entity11			2
the @entity30 man appeared to be referencing a well - known case of four nuns executed by the @entity34 national guard in december 1980			0
experts in the @entity34 conflict have said that following the tragedy , there were no church people killed in the country for more than eight years			0
however @entity0 's book , @entity42 , claims that he did not begin to cover the civil war in @entity1 until 1981			1
@entity0 responded to the @entity1 allegations in a statement to @entity46			1
he said : ' while in @entity1 , reporters were shown horrendous images of violence that were never broadcast , including depictions of nuns who were murdered			0
the mention of the nuns on my program came the day of the @entity57 massacre ( december 14 , 2012 )			0
' the segment was about evil and how hard it is for folks to comprehend it			0
i used the murdered nuns as an example of that evil			0
that ’s what i am referring to when i say '' i saw nuns get shot in the back of the head			0
'' no one could possibly take that segment as reporting on @entity1			0
' the latest allegations came as book publishers for @entity0 said on monday that they stand behind his work despite questions that have been raised about his reporting			1
@entity0 's series of books about the deaths of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 have sold millions of copies and been turned into successful movies for the @entity86			1
the latest adaptation , ' @entity88 , ' is set to premiere on @entity89			0
on tuesday , @entity11 reported on a 2013 online post that questioned @entity0 's claim that in 1977 he was outside the @entity93 home of @entity94 , a friend of @entity81 assassin @entity17 , when he killed himself with a shotgun			1
@entity96 had been contacted by congressional investigators looking into the assassination			0
@entity0 's claim that he was there was in his book ' @entity101			1
' @entity11 quoted police reports , media accounts , former colleagues and other sources that dispute @entity0 's claim that he was there			1
at the time , @entity0 was a reporter for a @entity108 television station			2
@entity110 ' fully stand behind @entity0 and his best - seller ' killing @entity81 , ' and we 're very proud to count him as one of our most important authors , ' spokesperson @entity109 said			2
@entity0 while reporting in @entity1 for @entity115 in 1982			1
he claimed to have seen ' nuns being gunned down ' - but it appears the event he was referencing took place a year before he arrived in the country @entity30 issued a statement reiterating its ' staunch support ' for @entity0 and said it would not respond to the individual accusations			2
also this week , the publisher of @entity0 's best - selling ' @entity125 ' defended the book , which refers to his disputed coverage of the @entity22			1
the magazine @entity20 said that @entity0 claimed to be in a ' war zone ' in @entity129 when instead he was at a demonstration far from the front			1
@entity132 , senior vice president and deputy publisher for the @entity134 , said that @entity134 would ' continue to publish our author 's book just as he wrote it			0
' @entity0 has faced questions on his books in the past			2
in 2011 , one of the stores at @entity143 in @entity144 , where @entity82 was assassinated , declined to sell ' @entity145 ' because of historical errors			0
those included giving the wrong year the theater was destroyed by fire and referring to the @entity149 in the @entity150 when it had not been built			0
media matters posted another story wednesday questioning an @entity0 statement that he had witnessed the execution of four nuns during @entity1 's civil war in 1980 , based on a 2012 statement that @entity0 made that ' i saw nuns get shot in the back of the head			1
' @entity0 said wednesday , however , that he had been shown pictures of the aftermath of the shooting while he was in @entity1			2
he said his 2012 statement , during a discussion of the nature of evil after the @entity57 , @entity170 , school shooting massacre , was a reference to seeing those pictures , not the shooting itself			0
@entity0 was defended — sort of — by longtime nemesis @entity175 on @entity177 's ' @entity176 ' on monday			2
@entity175 has suggested the media should be spending more time looking at the actions of politicians than media figures like @entity182 and @entity0			2
@entity175 noted the reporting on @entity0 's past work at the same time his @entity30 show , ' @entity125 , ' is sending a staffer to look at all the snow in @entity188 and question global warming — reporting more worthy of scrutiny			1
' why do n't we just agree that a certain amount of anecdotes from our media figures are seasoned with ( expletive ) and let 's move on , ' @entity175 said .			0
