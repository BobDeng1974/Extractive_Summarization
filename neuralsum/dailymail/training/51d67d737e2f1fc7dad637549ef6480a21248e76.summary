@entity0 does not look like a drink and drug - addled rocker			1
his skin is pink and soft , his hair is fluffy and clean , and his mutton chops are still fulsome			2
even his long - suffering liver is still going strong			2
‘ i tend to get pretty plastered but i ’ve got an amazing constitution , ’ he says			2
‘ all the different bands have tried to outdrink me and spike my drinks			2
@entity10 [ the @entity12 singer ] had all sorts of tricks			2
i was the only one who could keep up with him , though he was much more into drugs than me			1
mr @entity17 : @entity18 's @entity0 in 1973 , dressed in a striking suit , and sporting a similar pattern today			1
the 68 - year - old is happily married and has just written a book , @entity23 according to @entity0 ‘ but i ’ve never passed out			1
never even had a proper memory blackout			2
‘ today , i drink fewer drinks , but stronger : @entity26			2
i could still be up all night , no problem , but now it takes me a week to get over it			1
in fact , i ’m off out tonight ! ’ @entity33 ( real name @entity31 , after @entity34 ) is 68			1
back in the day , @entity18 , the glam rockers he fronted , were superstars			1
they sold 50 million records , made 20 albums and had six number ones , including 1973 @entity41 hit @entity42			1
officially the most heard song in the world , it still generates well over £ 500,000 in royalties every festive season — ‘ it ’s a brilliant pension plan , ’ says @entity0			1
they had groupies ( despite being ‘ a bit uglier and heavier than most of the other bands ’ ) and private jets			2
they partied every night , slept with hundreds of different girls ( ‘ though the best bit was always when they ’d ask us all round to their parents ’ house for sunday lunch ’ ) and grasped opportunities that most young lads from @entity58 could only have imagined			1
superstars : @entity18 sold 50 million records , made 20 albums and had six number ones , including 1973 @entity41 hit @entity42 ‘ most people we knew had never been abroad			1
when you ’re in a rock band , you want to pick up girls , drive flash cars and see the world — and we made the most of it			1
we did n’t know it was going to last 25 years ! ’ but @entity18 were never quite what you ’d describe as ‘ cool ’			1
there were no massive drug - binges ( ‘ we were more of a booze band ’ ) , no orgies , threesomes ( ‘ i do n’t think we were really into all that ’ ) or scandalous arrests			2
there was n’t even any gratuitous smashing - up of hotel rooms			2
while rival bands were busy hurling tellies through windows , @entity0 was more likely to be doing a spot of @entity94 in his room			1
wholesome : over the years , many of @entity33 ’s peers fell foul of drugs , alcohol , suicide , bankruptcy			1
above , pictured in 1974 ‘ i always carried a screwdriver , and later a full tool kit			0
so , if i had an hour before the gig , i ’d fix things			0
it was quicker than calling down to reception , and that way you can have it all nice for the next person			2
’ even @entity18 ’s legendary parties ( ‘ we had one pretty much every single night we were on tour ’ ) would come to a sudden halt when the boys got a bit tired			1
‘ we ’d put on [ @entity121 comedy ] @entity123 ’s @entity122			0
the @entity124 could n’t understand it , but we ’d fall about laughing and they ’d get bored and go home … and we ’d go to bed			0
’ over the years , many of @entity33 ’s peers fell foul of drugs , alcohol , suicide , bankruptcy , increasingly desperate comebacks and terrible hair - dye			1
he , meanwhile , remains a picture of wholesome contentment			0
he enjoys acting , radio work , does lucrative voice - overs for tv adverts , lives in a ‘ very nice house ’ near @entity139 , is happily married and has just written a book , @entity23 according to @entity33 , which is part memoir , part musings about life			1
he is also , despite leaving the band more than 23 years ago ( to tend to his dying father and pick up the pieces of his crumbling first marriage ) , instantly recognisable as @entity18 ’s frontman			1
‘ at least once a day throughout the year , someone shouts “ it ’s @entity41 ! ” at me			0
in december , it happens 10 or 20 times a day , and i have to get my @entity41 shopping out of the way before december or i get mobbed			2
‘ i ’m not complaining — writing @entity42 was the best day ’s work we ’ve ever done and i ’m proud of it — but they all think it ’s the first time anyone ’s ever shouted it			0
‘ and i ’ve been getting this for 40 - odd years ! ’ ( an estimated 42 per cent of the planet , more than three billion people , are thought to have heard @entity42			2
) today , people also try to grab covert snaps of @entity33 to post online			1
bizarrely , some men attempt to take surreptitious pictures of @entity33 ’s manhood as he relieves himself at public urinals			1
‘ they lean over and go “ click ”			0
it happens all the time			0
why on earth would someone want a photo of me p * * * ing ? ’ why indeed ? perhaps it ’s just the ( very odd ) price of fame			0
which all started in @entity58 in 1966 when @entity0 joined drummer @entity183 and guitarists @entity184 and @entity186 to form the ‘ @entity187			1
they later became @entity18 and had a huge hit with @entity190			1
they dressed in over-the - top mirrored outfits , strutted like peacocks ( ‘ the @entity194 thought four aliens had landed ’ ) , made a fortune and paid outlandish amounts of tax			2
‘ it was 83 per cent ! we could have gone abroad for a bit and avoided it — lots of bands did — but we were from working - class families and we had a social conscience			0
’ success : @entity42 was @entity18 's third single in a year to go straight in at @entity208 in 1973 ( after @entity209 and @entity210 ) — something even @entity212 did n’t manage @entity42 was their third single in a year to go straight in at @entity208 in 1973 ( after @entity209 and @entity210 ) — something even @entity212 did n’t manage			1
yet as punk music took over in the mid- 70s , @entity18 ’s star faded			1
‘ suddenly , we were boring old farts , playing civic centres again			0
by 1980 , we were pretty much finished			0
’ and then @entity10 dropped out of the @entity219 , @entity18 filled in and the crowd went berserk			1
we had a second wave in the @entity224			0
’ @entity33 has always been a big believer in ‘ what goes around comes around ’			1
‘ i love everyone on sight , and you ’d have to do something really bad for me to turn nasty			0
‘ i have never knowingly lied , or done anything nasty to anyone , or even nicked anything			0
’ he even gets on with his first wife , @entity236 , with whom he has two daughters			0
he claims @entity236 was one of the biggest supporters of his budding romance with his second wife , @entity242 , a television executive and journalist whom he met when she was 24 and he was 43			0
they now have a 19 - year - old son , @entity247			0
‘ i never chucked a telly out of the window , but i did drive a car into a swimming pool once			0
it was teetering on the edge , anyway			0
‘ and we never went short of women			0
@entity255 got all the screamers , but we got our fair share			0
’ and , latterly , it transpires , a lot of letters from people claiming to be @entity33 ’s illegitimate offspring			1
‘ i used to have loads of people claiming i ’d fathered them — loads ! they ’d write to the office — sometimes nice letters , often not			2
they all tried it on			0
you just had to ignore it			0
’ and would he have remembered fathering them anyway ? ‘ @entity272 , no ! of course not			0
it was all about money			0
that ’s all they cared about			0
’ is there anything that gets him riled up ? this is someone who was ditched by @entity287 series @entity285 because he was n’t grumpy enough			0
‘ oh yes , loads ! politicians , lack of respect for elders , people who talk in “ quiet carriages ” , cycling on pavements — that drives me crackers			0
’ oh yes , and being asked if the original @entity18 will ever reform			1
i ’ve toured the world 20 times already			2
’ ) nor has he any intention of watching bandmates @entity183 and @entity184 , who still tour as @entity18 ‘ it ’d make me feel funny to watch			1
i ’d feel strange watching half the band doing the songs that the other half wrote			2
i did n’t really want them to carry on using the name , but it was n’t worth going to court for , was it ? life ’s too short for all that s * * *			0
’ @entity0 is one of the most content people you ’ll meet			1
he seems remarkably unspoilt by success — and , as ever , looking forward to a strong drink			0
and another very lucrative @entity41			0
n @entity23 according to @entity33 ( @entity316 , £ 5 ) is available from september 25 only at @entity317 as part of their @entity319 .			1
