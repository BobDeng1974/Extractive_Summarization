if you do n't believe in climate change , you 're less likely to feel that the weather is getting warmer - and vice versa			2
that 's according to a study that analysed how people remembered a particularly warm winter in the @entity8 in 2012			1
and they found those who believed in climate change remembered it being warmer , while those who did n't thought it was colder			0
@entity8 researchers say political beliefs affect our view on the weather			1
they studied perceptions of the anomalously warm @entity8 winter in 2012 ( @entity21 shown )			1
democrats and women remembered the winter as being warmer			1
but @entity25 and men said that it was colder than it was the research , published in @entity30 , was carried out by three @entity8 sociologists - , dr @entity32 of @entity33 , dr @entity34 of @entity35 , and dr @entity36 of @entity37			2
they studied how people remembered the erroneously warm winter of 2012 , which was the fourth warmest on record for the @entity8 of the previous 117 winters			1
a report from the @entity44 recently claimed that the world must brace itself for more extreme weather , as it is locked on a path to unstoppable warming			0
they said some effects of climate change will be unavoidable owing to past and predicted emissions from power plants , factories and cars			0
but they added the worst impacts could be avoided by cutting global emissions			0
the report , entitled ' turn down the @entity60 : confronting the @entity61 ' , stated that the average temperature on @entity63 will be 1.5 째 @entity64 ) above pre-industrial levels by 2050			0
sea levels will also continue to rise as the vast ice sheets in @entity69 and @entity70 thaw slowly , they said			0
during the winter , the seasonal average was about 1.9 째 @entity73 ) above the 20th century average			0
the researchers compared data from @entity78 polls in early march 2012 after the winter ended with temperature data from the @entity8 , reports the @entity81			2
most correctly said that the weather had been unusual , with those in more affected areas noticing the conditions more			0
but those with certain political and scientific beliefs had differing views on how severe the changes had been			0
' @entity91 [ were ] more likely than @entity25 to perceive local winter temperatures as warmer than usual , ' the researchers wrote			2
liberals and women were also more likely than conservatives and males to attribute the warmer - than - normal local winter temperatures to global warming			2
the results suggest that , apart from actual science , people 's view on climate change can be skewed by their beliefs			1
and as the climate has the potential to become more out - of - tune with normality in the coming years , the researchers warn it will be harder and harder to convince people on global warming			1
for example , they say , climate change not only drives warmer weather but also cold extremes owing to increased vapour in the atmosphere			0
' if you ca n't reach the committed conservatives on the fact that a significantly warmer season might be due to anthropogenic [ human - caused ] global warming , i think it 's going to be really hard to convince them that the current situation is due to anthropogenic climate change , ' study co-author @entity34 told the @entity81			1
' the results were also consistent with people 's beliefs on global warming ( stock image shown )			1
and the researchers warn it will be difficult to convince people the climate is changing due to human activity as it becomes more wild , with both colder and warmer spells expected			1
