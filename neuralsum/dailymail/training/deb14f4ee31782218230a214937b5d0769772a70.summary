a mixed - race clubber arrested over a taxi rank bust - up has finally won a five - year legal battle with police over racial discrimination			1
@entity5 , 35 , claimed she was wrongly arrested in @entity6 in 2009 and ill - treated by police officers due to the colour of her skin			1
the reveller and two friends were involved in a row which saw officers swiftly arrest @entity14 but leave her two white friends alone			1
@entity5 ( pictured ) , claimed she was wrongly arrested in @entity6 in 2009 and ill - treated by police officers due to the colour of her skin it was only when taxi marshals continuously said the others had also been involved that they were eventually arrested too			1
miss @entity5 was charged with assaulting a taxi marshal and a public disorder offence but was cleared at a trial when no evidence was offered			1
she immediately complained to the @entity23 , which rejected her claim , forcing her to take her protest to the @entity26			0
for the last five years she has represented herself in a legal battle with @entity28			1
the clerk claimed racial discrimination , false imprisonment , assault , malicious prosecution , breach of her @entity35 while in custody , misfeasance in public office and defamation			1
her civil case was finally heard this summer in front of judge @entity42 , who has now found against her in every claim - except racial discrimination			1
he ruled that , although the fact @entity14 had been arrested was not discrimination , the way in which she was cuffed - with her hands behind her back - was			2
her friends , @entity52 and @entity53 , were not treated in the same manner and the officers must have ' proceeded on the basis of racial stereotype ' , he concluded			0
miss @entity5 is planning to appeal the ruling but said she was pleased with the result			0
' racial discrimination was the most important claim , one which is normally so hard to prove against police , ' she said			1
' i would like to know what the constabulary 's legal services have to say now , as their @entity68 twice stated there was not a trace of racial discrimination demonstrated by police officers			1
' the court was told @entity14 and @entity74 got into an argument with a taxi driver after a night out in @entity6 in 2009 , when he insisted they pay an up - front fare			1
they ended up in an altercation with two taxi marshals and police were called after the girls , alongside another bystander mr @entity53 , were identified as assault suspects , the court heard			1
officers swiftly arrested miss @entity5 , from @entity87 , @entity6 , but pushed @entity74 and mr @entity53 away			2
for the last five years , @entity5 has represented herself in a legal battle with @entity28			1
the constabulary 's headquarters is pictured after protests they later arrested @entity74 , who was cleared of an assault charge , and mr @entity94 , who was cleared of breaching the peace			0
judge @entity96 said : ' the case in racial discrimination was not , as i read it , solely that the claimant was arrested , but that the claimant was arrested and the others , in the first instance , not			1
' the other two were not merely not arrested by the police officers present , but were directed away by police officers , physically pushing @entity52 away , and leaving the two to walk away			0
' it is only the visible intervention of a taxi marshal which persuades one police officer , a little while after , to follow the direction where @entity52 and mr @entity53 had walked away			2
' i do not consider that any difference in treatment of the claimant , compared with @entity52 ( or mr @entity53 ) was consciously motivated by racial discrimination			2
' there is a notable absence of any suggestion of racist language , or overt racist approach , on the part of the police officers			0
' i find that in the omission to take any steps to detain , or arrest , the other two persons pointed out to them , and in the rear handcuffing of @entity14 , the police officers concerned must have proceeded on the basis of racial stereotype			0
' i do not find that in arresting @entity14 herself , they did so			0
' miss @entity5 also claimed she felt racially discriminated against because she was put in the cage in the police van on the way to the police station , while her fellow detainees were allowed to sit in the main part of the van			2
' i find the evidence of the claimant persuasive that she did not resist arrest at the scene , ' the @entity96 said			0
' i conclude , on the balance of probabilities , that she did not resist arrest at the scene			0
' i do not consider it particularly striking that she was placed in the cage of the police van , if she was the first to be arrested ; and space is limited			0
' although the level of damages for racial discrimination is unlimited the @entity96 said the pay - out was likely to be ' modest '			2
miss @entity5 has also made a complaint to the @entity157 against the judge over alleged issues after the case was heard			0
a spokesman for the @entity157 confirmed that a complaint against the judge has been received			0
@entity164 , head of professional standards , said : ' we recognise the judgement made by the @entity26 and welcome the fact the judge found the arrest to be lawful			2
' we will review the judgement and consider whether any further action should be taken and whether there are any learnings to be taken from the case			0
