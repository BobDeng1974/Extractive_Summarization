by @entity0 the mystery of how farming techniques spread throughout @entity3 , signalling a significant shift away from hunting , has baffled scientists for decades			1
now , the dna of the first @entity9 farmers living 10,000 years ago has revealed migration , rather than cultural adoption , was to blame			1
experts believe genetic similarities between the dna of the first @entity16 populations and the dna of the first @entity18 and @entity19 farmers , suggests small pioneering groups migrated across @entity3 , taking farming methods with them			1
the mitochondrial dna of the first @entity9 farmers ( remains pictured ) living 10,000 years ago has been sequenced			1
experts believe genetic similarities between this dna , and the dna of the first @entity18 and @entity19 farmers , suggests small groups migrated across @entity3 , taking farming methods with them the @entity26 was the world 's first verifiable revolution in agriculture			1
it saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures moving from hunting and gathering practices , to ones of farming and building small settlements			0
archaeological evidence suggests the domestication of a number of animals and the growing of plants , evolved in different locations around the world , perhaps beginning in what is now @entity45 around 12,000 years ago			1
the revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travelling men into settled communities who built villages and towns			0
some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques			0
others stored food for times of hunger , and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies			0
scientists analysed samples dating to around @entity69 from three sites located in the birthplace of @entity16 farming practices - in the @entity74 basin and the oasis of @entity76 , in modern @entity77			1
it is thought that agricultural practices originated in a region of the @entity9 known as the ‘ @entity81 ’ in around 12,000bc			1
these practices resulted in a profound social , cultural and economic transformation of human populations as communities became more settled and started founding the very first towns			0
@entity88 , an author of the study from the @entity90 , said : ‘ the @entity26 rapidly expanded from these territories into @entity3 , where the hunter - gatherer subsistence economy - prevailing till then - was replaced by an agro pastoral ( farming and livestock ) producing system			0
' for the past 50 years , scientists have debated whether knowledge spread as the result of population migration , or cultural adoption			0
different research fields including archaeology , physical anthropology , linguistics and human palaeogenetics have made contributions to the discussion			0
scientists analysed samples dating to around @entity69 from three sites located in the birthplace of @entity16 farming practices - in the @entity114 ( marked with shading ) and the oasis of @entity76 , in modern @entity77 ( also marked ) for the past 50 years , scientists have debated whether knowledge spread as the result of population migration , or cultural adoption			1
one of the sites from which the samples were taken is pictured while there have been some breakthroughs in hinting at the genetic composition of first @entity16 populations , this latest study , published in the journal @entity124 by experts at @entity90 , @entity127 @entity126 , the @entity128 and the @entity129 , is the first to reveal their genetic makeup			2
they studied maternally inherited dna from the first @entity16 farmers taken from samples			2
the sites are located in modern day @entity77			0
here , an archaeologist painstakingly reveals an ancient structure hidden by the earth professor @entity145 , from the @entity90 , said the results ‘ are the first ones regarding first @entity9 farmers - in other words , the genetic stock of original @entity16			2
’ ‘ conclusions of previous studies are based on the comparison with current @entity9 populations , as first agricultural societies and genetics have remained unknown until now			2
’ genetic similarities have been observed between the mitochondrial dna of first @entity16 populations and the dna of first @entity18 and @entity19 farmers			1
this suggests @entity16 expansion probably took place through pioneer migrations of small groups of people			2
the two main migration routes - @entity170 and @entity3 - might have been genetically linked , the experts explained			0
dr @entity88 said : ‘ the most significant conclusion is that the degree of genetic similarity between the populations of the @entity81 and the ones of @entity176 an @entity177 supports the hypothesis that @entity16 spread in @entity3 took place through pioneer seafaring colonisation , not through a land - mediated expansion through @entity184 , as it was thought until now			1
’ other scientists have already challenged the notion that ancient man – a group living after the @entity189 known as @entity190 - @entity3 – spread from @entity184 in modern @entity45			0
dr @entity145 added : ‘ recent archaeological finds have proved that the @entity16 arrived in @entity176 around 10,600 years ago , some years after the first documentation of agricultural practices in the @entity9			1
’ architecture and burial models found in @entity176 ’ sites are similar to the ones found in the @entity74 basin , which ‘ indicates a direct colonisation of these territories , ’ he said			0
radiocarbon dating of different objects from @entity16 sites in the @entity9 and @entity3 also suggests that a journey by sea was first made via @entity176			2
the team of experts will analyse a larger number of human @entity16 samples from other regions of the @entity81 in a bid to increase the number of genetic markers examined in the samples			2
it is thought agricultural practices originated in a region of the @entity9 known as the ' @entity81 ' in around 12,000bc			1
this resulted in a profound social , cultural and economic transformation of human populations as communities became more settled			0
samples were taken from the ancient site pictured			0

genetic similarities between the dna of the first @entity16 populations and the dna of the first @entity18 and @entity19 farmers have been *spotted*
evidence suggests small groups spread across @entity3 10,000 years ago
these pioneers are said to have taken farming techniques with them
dna samples were taken from three sites in modern @entity77
agricultural practices originated in a region of the @entity9 known as the ‘ @entity81 ’ in around 12,000bc
