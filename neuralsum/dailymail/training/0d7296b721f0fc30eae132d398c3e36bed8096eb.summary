by @entity0 for the @entity1 some @entity2 may feel chronically overworked – but our employers offer more paid holidays than almost anywhere else in the world			1
analysis shows that our guaranteed leave of 28 days a year is beaten only by @entity10 ’s 30			0
and we are streets ahead of the @entity11 – where workers are not actually legally entitled to a single day of paid holiday			0
take a break : @entity15 , @entity16 , the @entity2 and parts of @entity18 lead the world in paid leave as this graphic shows but while it may look like cause for celebration , there is a catch – for when paid public holidays are added to the equation , we slip to tenth , behind the likes of @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
the figures were collated by the @entity34 in @entity35 its report compared the holiday entitlement in the @entity11 with the 20 other richest countries in the world – members of the @entity42 ( @entity42 )			0
the analysis was based on working an average five - day week ; a definitive comparison between nations was not possible because some have different entitlements for different types of worker			0
on the whole , the @entity2 was found to come second with 28 days of statutory annual leave			1
before 2009 there was just a 20 - day holiday entitlement , but this was raised to incorporate eight bank holidays to tackle firms ’ failure to pay staff for these days			0
hot spot : @entity11 workers have some of the world 's iconic attractions on their doorstep , including the @entity64 and @entity65 , but have to work their socks off to enjoy them although the total of 28 is lower than other countries when their respective public holidays are included , the @entity2 figure is still considered favourably because workers can choose to work on public holidays , and take the days off in lieu later on			1
this means they can ‘ bank ’ them together and use them to go away on holiday , which workers in several other countries can not do			0
once public holidays are included , @entity10 is overtaken by @entity30 and @entity83 , which have 13 public holidays to add to 22 days of statutory annual leave , giving a total of 35 days			1
@entity31 is next with 12 public holidays on top of 22 days ’ leave			2
@entity32 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 also overtake the @entity2 once paid public holidays are included			2
however , pity the poor @entity94			0
the nations of @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 have no guaranteed paid public holidays on top of their 25 days of statutory annual leave			2
the law in the @entity11 offers no guarantees of paid leave at all , but workers are given ten days for holidays such as @entity106 and @entity107 – although there is no guarantee they will be paid on these occasions			1
mercifully , most employers do offer their staff paid annual leave – although this is typically limited to just two weeks .			2

the @entity2 's 28 days of statutory paid leave is the most in the world
but @entity30 workers get more days off when public holidays are added
employers in the @entity11 do *n't* have to give their staff any paid leave
