by @entity0 a drab brick building on the side of the @entity4 , you would n't guess this storage company is packed full of priceless war - era artefacts			1
but observant drivers that look up will spot there 's something unusual about @entity11			0
whether it 's an anti-aircraft gun or an @entity13 , sometimes even a double - decker bus , one of the incredible items will be tantalisingly placed on the roof for all to see			1
@entity18 : the @entity19 , perched on the roof of @entity11 in @entity21			2
it is one of the pieces of ' junk ' @entity26 collected in years of heavy - lifting unusual : the veteran soldier and storage company owner places items such as an @entity13 spitfire plane on his roof by the @entity4 to brighten the days of passing motorists it is the only glimpse veteran soldier @entity26 offers into his emporium of cast - offs , which is his own personal collection amidst his client 's belongings			1
outsiders are not permitted to tours			0
one of the prized possessions is a @entity43 printer			0
designed in 1883 by @entity46 engineer @entity45 , it was once the treasured machine used to create the nation 's newspapers , magazines , and posters			0
a 7.3 ” anti-aircraft gun , weighing 17 tonnes , has made an appearance on the roof , decades after its debut on the battlefield in 1937			2
the powerful weapon was known to fire a shell to a height of 59,300ft			0
and sat amongst the machinery is an original @entity62 bus , abandoned years ago by the government in a crackdown on road safety and pollution levels			2
mr @entity26 's now extensive stockpile started as a side project at the heavy - lifting business he founded exactly 50 years ago with two fellow servicemen , @entity71 - an expert in moving machinery - and @entity74			1
festive : a giant @entity76 was placed on top of the building in december			2
mr @entity26 still has cranes left over from their lifting work to put up his displays emporium : the proud businessman 's collection of artefacts was built up over years of storage			1
this @entity21 routemaster was one of the abandoned objects priceless : this 7.3 " anti-aircraft gun weighing 17 tonnes was introduced by the @entity92 army in 1937 in preparation for @entity94			0
it fired a shell to a height of 59,300ft elderly retired @entity99 machines in @entity101 s warehouse at @entity102			0
the @entity43 machine is possibly the most famous machine in the printing industry ; it was designed by a brilliant @entity46 engineer @entity45 in 1883 enraptured by the machinery , he began to cumulate some of the abandoned ' junk ' they had to move			0
together , the trio orchestrated the transport of historic monuments including the @entity112 for 30 years , the 486 - tonne @entity114 printing presses from @entity115 , and the @entity116			1
within a few years the firm diversified into removals , storage , and tropical plant sellers - and started up setting offices across the country			1
despite selling off the crane business long ago to focus on storage , they still have some bits of equipment to shift about the artillery guns and fighter jets			2
the @entity19 that mr @entity26 lifts up during the summer months was one of the first ever used by the @entity13 in 1953			1
and the @entity13 was given to the trio specifically for the roof after they helped move an exhibition - load of craft			2
for the festive season , a giant blow - up @entity76 overlooked the busy commuters passage			1
and when it gets too cluttered , he can always lift his own car onto the roof to clear space			2
' it 's just a lot of fun , ' mr @entity26 said			1
a @entity21 scene : last year the firm chose a mini @entity21 scene to decorate the snow - topped building make room : using some of the cranes left over from the heavy - lifting business , before they moved into predominantly storage , mr @entity26 sometimes has to move his car onto the roof for space a 5.5in howitzer from the @entity157			1
the eight - tonne gun has a range of 11 miles and aided the success of @entity94 soldiers in @entity162 , @entity163 , and on @entity164 ' we always tried to say yes to clients so we did end up doing some odd projects			0
' once we had to move a hippo from @entity170 zoo to @entity171			0
' my highlight was meeting the queen when we went to move some aircraft off the roof			0
' we also specialised in the careful movement and storage of expensive precision machinery throughout @entity180 and further afield for decades , and the @entity19 is one of the pieces			0
' putting these planes , buses , dogs on the roof ... it 's like a taste of the 50 years gone by			1
' the fascination began when mr @entity26 was called up for @entity189 in 1959 , one of the last intakes			2
a @entity192 single decker bus being lifted into position onto the roof to advertise for bus drivers and received bus loads of applicants advert : the @entity114 was even bestowed an advert by the firm with this display for the @entity202 in the foreground , an @entity203 and in the back ground the @entity19 @entity206 @entity26 standing beside a ferret armoured car			1
he was one of the three founders of @entity11 which started on 4th august 1964 and was called up for @entity189 in 1959 , one of the last intakes commissioned in the 5th @entity210 , he started off with a troop of @entity212 followed by a troop of @entity214			0
shortly , the colonel asked him to take command of @entity217 , eight ferret armoured cars , and two three - tonne vehicles			0
mr @entity26 said : ' the first 6 weeks of square bashing was n’t the most peaceful but thereafter it was fun			1
' @entity217 in an armoured regiment is an exciting job ; they are the eyes and ears of the regiment			0
' i would be the first to confess that @entity189 did me and my lasting friends the power of good ! ' returning to @entity21 five years later , he was one of the three founders of @entity11 which started on august 4 , 1964			0
the company , now headed by mr @entity26 's son , @entity232 , is compiling a book to mark the 50 - year anniversary .			1
