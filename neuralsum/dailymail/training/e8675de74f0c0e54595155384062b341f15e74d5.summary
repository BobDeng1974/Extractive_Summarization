by @entity0 , @entity1 world number 690 @entity3 will take a two - shot lead into the final round of the @entity6 after home favourite @entity8 ’s charge faltered on saturday			1
@entity8 surged two clear of the field thanks to six birdies in his opening 13 holes at @entity14 , but bogeyed the 15th and 18th to card a third round of 69			1
that left the 50 - year - old , who was fourth in the @entity20 last month and then won on his @entity22 debut seven days later , on five - under - par and allowed overnight leader @entity3 to reclaim top spot with birdies at the 15th and 16th in a round of 71			1
in the driving seat : @entity3 has a two - shot lead going into the final round of the @entity6 chance gone ? @entity8 was two clear of the field at one stage during his third round but boegys at the 15th and 18th hole cost him dear ' i ’m a little disappointed with that , ' admitted @entity8 , who has no plans to switch to the seniors circuit as he chases a fifth @entity39 appearance at @entity40 in september			1
' i did n’t hit it very well the last few holes			2
' i played very well the first nine holes and was solid until the 14th but made a bad bogey on the 15th where i three - putted from eight metres and also bogeyed the last			1
' @entity8 is already the oldest winner in @entity47 history , beating his own record by winning the @entity49 for a record fourth time at the age of 49 years and 337 days last december			1
but despite 20 tournament victories to his credit , the world number 34 has never won his national open and added : ' it would be nice			0
i ’d love to win the @entity6 of course and we ’ll see what happens tomorrow			1
' poise : @entity3 hits his approach into the fourth hole during the third round of the @entity6 @entity3 only turned professional in june last year and secured his @entity47 card via the qualifying school at @entity65 in november , aided by an opening round of 64			1
the 22 - year - old said : “ it was a solid day			2
i hit solid shots and really played to my strengths			2
i got two over par early just because my short game was n’t sharp enough but i took advantage of the par fives again today and the shots dropped in the end			2
' i stayed really patient , you need to be on this course and i ’m getting better and better at it			0
you know that it ’s going to be a hard day and an even par is a good score			0
' i ’ve always done well on really tough courses , i like grinding it out , not having to shoot six or seven under			0
today i shot one under and i ’m in the lead			1
' i ’m excited for tomorrow			0
i ’ll just go out to play golf , obviously playing for a win too			0
' playing with @entity8 will be fun , i ’ll get to learn a lot from him and i ’ll just soak it all in			1
i ’ve never played with him or any of the big names			0
the crowd will also be bigger and all the support will go to him but i just have to play my own game			0
' in the red : @entity96 is three shots off the lead at the @entity6 @entity99 ’s @entity96 , @entity101 ’s @entity100 and @entity103 left - hander @entity102 are three shots off the lead on four under , @entity96 holing a putt estimated at 100 feet on the eighth for one of his five birdies			1
@entity101 ’s @entity115 is among a five - strong group on three under , the @entity114 winner carding a best - of - the - day 67 which included two eagles			2
' i ’m very pleased , ' @entity115 said			0
' starting the day two over par i wanted to get into red figures and i managed to do that			0
' i played really well and the difference from yesterday to today was that i had the speed of the greens			0
yesterday i really struggled , i felt the greens were a lot slower than they were on thursday morning so i ’m pleased to go out there and play a solid round of golf			0

@entity3 holds a two - shot lead going into @entity6 final round
home favourite @entity8 is two shots behind in second
@entity8 surged two clear of field after 13 holes but ended round with bogeys at the 15th and 18th
