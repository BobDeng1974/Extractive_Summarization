hardly a day passes without a spurious new survey which lists our supposedly favourite things			1
an example of this banality last week was one about what makes us most happy			1
among the feel - good experiences were said to be fresh sheets and popping bubble wrap			1
reading this idiotic list made me extremely depressed			1
you can not reduce life to a catchphrase or a ranking like a best - buy at @entity16 ’s			1
experiences which bring us true pleasure are being with loved ones , enjoying warm weather , eating wonderful home - cooked food and just laughing uncontrollably			1
it ’s not rocket science			2
surely a far more useful exercise is to list every aspect of modern life that makes us unhappy			1
here ’s my list of pet hates — which gets longer by the day : in the face of an increasing number of surveys claiming to reveal what makes us most happy , @entity31 reveals her list of the things that are making her unhappy - which is getting longer by the day ! trendy men with @entity40 is there anything less attractive than a man ’s chin covered by a thick mat of hair ? @entity47 forbid you get close enough to snog anyone sprouting a beard that makes them look like a @entity53 folk singer or an extra from a remake of @entity55			1
secret face - lifts every september , i encounter women whose faces look suspiciously taut , whose saggy chins have vanished and who have managed to eradicate the bags under their eyes			1
although they put this good health down to a ‘ wonderfully restful holiday ’ , the truth is they ’ve had a face - lift			1
@entity67 the bane of @entity69 , cafes and hotels			2
what ’s wrong with a pot of jam on the table ? @entity76 every night these simpering females appear on local tv news bulletins , posing pertly in front of a map of @entity81 in very high heels , and totally inappropriate cocktail frocks , waving perfectly manicured hands around			2
vouchers past use - by dates as a dedicated bargain - hunter , it causes deep pain to discover at the till that my carefully - collected discount vouchers have expired			1
@entity31 is a self - confessed bargain hunter who hates it when she discovers her vouchers are out of date anything called ‘ an experience ’ shopping has become a pastime , like making raffia mats or embroidery , and addicts dignify this mindless activity by talking about the ‘ experience ’			1
everything is an ‘ experience ’ these days , from a car wash to munching on a burger			2
@entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 is there anything more soul - destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans , peas and lettuces from seed , only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures			1
dieting celebrities nothing makes me crosser than celebrities ’ claims that any weight - loss is due to ‘ eating healthily ’			1
nine times out of ten , they ’ve been paid a huge sum of money to plug a diet plan or a food supplement			2
chefs who think they ’re picasso too many chefs fiddle with a decent meal and turn it into something that artist @entity136 would be proud of			2
for example , with chive and parmesan crisps carefully balanced like a propeller surrounded by drips of gravy			2
pay - by - phone car parking what ’s wrong with cash ? this drives people crazy — especially older people who find it a big hassle to try to use a phone to pay for 20 minutes in a car park so you can get your shopping in boots			1
@entity31 remains baffled by pay - by - phone car parking , what 's wrong with cash ? @entity162 - @entity161 at airports after patiently waiting my turn , i could murder anyone who suddenly appears out of the blue and joins a ‘ friend ’ in the queue in front on me			1
@entity171 sold at a premium price because we are so desperate to extend our lives by a month , that we want to stuff ourselves with goji berries , quinoa , purple sprouting broccoli , pink tomatoes and hideous kale			0
funny how mum and dad were so thin and fit , without a single goji berry			0
fake words for example , air stewards talk of ‘ de-planing ’ ( do n’t they mean ‘ disembarking ’ or ‘ getting off ’ ) ? railway stations are described as ‘ calling points ’			0
i heard a radio reporter speak about @entity192 ‘ jubilating ’ after the country ’s recent election			0
phoney words started when ordinary people started being called ‘ stake - holders ’			1
re-sealable bags of rice whoever invented the ‘ re-sealable ’ bag for rice , nuts , pasta etc , i want to go around to their house and shout : ‘ it does n’t work ! ’ ‘ re-sealable ’ bag for rice , nuts , pasta just do n't make sense to @entity31 @entity216 the @entity218 ’s gadgets			1
if @entity47 had meant us to live on green slime , he would have given us gills and no teeth			0
part of the enjoyment of food is the textures and fibres			0
no one is going to reduce my breakfast to slurry in the name of an energy drink			0
@entity235 the impossible dream — turning back time with a pot of gunk			0
only a giant pleat pulled together at the back of my neck will get rid of the sagging jowls on my jawline			0
the cheapest solution is to talk a lot , so the loose flesh keeps moving and it either tightens up or it ’s not so obvious			0
paying bills online having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old - fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope			1
@entity253 i ’m useless at this , and am infuriated when check - out staff in the supermarket ( ordered to do so by their boss ) ask how i am			2
if wanted to talk to them , i ’d open the conversation			0
@entity262 in my mind , this will for ever be ‘ dad ’ jazz , not helped by the fact @entity267 grandee @entity266 is a huge fan			0
modern jazz is fantastic , but i ’m afraid the late clarintettist @entity270 has a lot to answer for			0
trad jazz goes with halitosis , corduroy trousers , a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat			0
@entity277 i am a decent cook , but i ’ve never managed to make a @entity279 pud that did n’t resemble an old shoe sole			0
and do n’t bother writing in with your tips , i ’ve tried them all			0
@entity284 and lifeless @entity279 puddings are also something that @entity31 's added to her list of annoyances getting my name wrong do n’t ever call me @entity290 ! in @entity291 , i ’m routinely called miss street or mrs @entity31			1
sorry , i managed to marry a double - barrelled bloke , but that ’s my name , so get over it			2
@entity297 is this a substitute for real cleaning — folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed , turned into origami swans ? central heating controls when the @entity218 wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury , he devised the control box for programming central heating			0
holiday settings , off - peak settings and then copying each day ’s setting to the next day … i feel miserable just thinking about it			2
country pub @entity316 as a walker , i know that the more remote the pub , the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm			0
they think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion			0
forget the ‘ hospitality industry ’ , it ’s more like the hostility industry			0
traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps , according to @entity31 ( stock image ) @entity337 i am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters , my roof , the central heating , the drains , the pipework , the pet , and my holidays			1
how did we get through life before the advent of insurance ? i have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me £ 200 a year was pointless			0
men and shopping lists what is it about men and supermarkets ? why do they have to go off - piste ? instead of getting the essentials you ’ve carefully written down for them , they buy their own favourites : a nasty can of hot dogs , a huge pot of @entity369 mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps			1
steps at stations maybe it ’s because i make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left - overs from the fridge , my computer , some clean clothes and a book			2
but why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park ? ready - to - eat fruit another supermarket scam — you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe , but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours			2
@entity395 ok , i have n’t had a baby , only four husbands — but i do n’t go around flashing photos of them at people			0
why should i be interested in someone ’s new baby , unless they are directly related to me ? most babies look exactly the same anyway , just giant tadpoles in nappies			0
@entity31 ca n't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new - born children ( stock image ) @entity411 we ’ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk , dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones			1
ugh ! train announcements every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard ( now called a ‘ train manager ’ ! ) making endless useless announcements about the next station , the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks ( i.e. just crisps ) in the buffet car ( now re-named the ‘ on - board café ’			1
) @entity432 there ’s nothing more annoying than someone who does n’t replace a toilet roll			0
bad impersonators of me about once a month , a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly			0
being confronted by an embarrassed 16 - year - old with ginger hair attempting to mimic my accent is not remotely entertaining !			2

an increasing number of surveys claim to reveal what makes us happiest
but are these *generic* lists really of any use to us ?
@entity31 makes her own list - of things making her unhappy !
