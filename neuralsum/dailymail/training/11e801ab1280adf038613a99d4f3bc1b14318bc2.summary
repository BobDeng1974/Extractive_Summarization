by @entity0 tv watchdogs have rapped @entity2 for letting celebrity @entity4 housemates talk about their sexual experiences and make ' rude food ' while children were watching			1
housemates were shown discussing their first sexual encounters while @entity10 boasted about having ' loads of sex with other men ' during an edition of the reality tv show			1

its ruling said : ' the cumulative effect of the humorous references to a penis and the use of sexual innuendos , together with the frank discussions on the topic of sexual experiences , resulted in an inappropriate , and prominent , sexual theme and adult tone			0
' we therefore considered the material was unsuitable for children			2
' the industry watchdog said viewing figures showed that , from a total audience of 290,000 viewers , 33,500 viewers had been aged 16 or under			1
this meant that children made up 12 per cent of the audience			0
meanwhile the offending show was watched by 8,800 children aged between four and nine			0
@entity32 said the sexual material was not explicit and it was ' humorous in intent ' , but added that the content ' required more careful editing before broadcasting at 11.30 on a sunday morning			2
' rude jokes : @entity32 criticised @entity2 for not warning parents of the episode 's unsuitable content there had been no advance warning to help parents wishing to protect children from unsuitable material , the watchdog 's ruling said			1
it went on : ' we considered that these factors resulted in this material being inconsistent with audience expectations for the content broadcast on this public service channel at 11:30 at a weekend			0
' we therefore concluded the material was not appropriately scheduled and the broadcast was in breach of the rule			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said that ' cheeky conversation , rude language and mildly sexually suggestive innuendos ' should be expected in pre-watershed broadcasts			2
the episode had been checked before being broadcast on the sunday morning after some content had been removed or ' bleeped			0
' he said the ' rude food ' scenes had been only ' mildly risqué , ' and the sexual discussions were ' not explicit , highly charged or erotic			1
' but he said : ' we accept that , in hindsight , it may have been prudent to have ensured that an appropriate flagging was aired prior to the daytime repeat			0
