@entity0 has been condemned over its handling of the case of bloodthirsty @entity3 no organisation is more important in the fight against terrorism within our society than @entity0			1
the security and intelligence service ’s crest rightly reminds its officers of their duty ‘ to defend our realm ’			2
yet in recent days the service has been ferociously attacked over its handling of the case of the bloodthirsty @entity3 , now unmasked as @entity16 , a computer graduate from the @entity17			2
much of this condemnation has focused on the revelation that , before he left to join the @entity21 jihad in @entity22 , @entity16 was known to @entity0 as an extremist and may even have had links to the 2005 @entity26 bombers			1
but there have also been noisy complaints , widely relayed across the media , that it was @entity0 ’s supposedly heavy - handed surveillance which drove @entity16 down the path to radicalism			1
all too predictably , the verbal assault on the security service has been led by the @entity35 which , with typical self - importance and disdain for our national interests , has set itself up as judge and jury over the saga			0
like the left - wing @entity44 newspaper , the @entity35 has been giving copious airtime to the nauseating pressure group @entity46 , which has a long record of providing support for @entity50 terror suspects			1
given an undeserved platform by the @entity35 , @entity46 ’s spokesman @entity51 peddled the revolting propaganda line that @entity16 had been a ‘ gentle ’ and ‘ beautiful ’ man until apparently forced to become a sadistic executioner because of @entity0 ’s cruel harassment			1
according to @entity51 ’s grotesque theory , this harassment by @entity0 began after @entity16 had attempted to go on ‘ safari ’ to @entity60 with a couple of other @entity63 extremists – he was arrested on landing in @entity64 en route to @entity66 – following his graduation			1
the complaint of heavy - handedness in dealing with extremist suspects is simply absurd			2
spooking people like @entity16 is absolutely necessary			1
they should feel they are being monitored			0
to inflict on the @entity75 public such special pleading as @entity51 ’s and twisting of the evidence in support of a murderous death cult is a betrayal of @entity35 values			0
it is the moral equivalent of giving @entity83 a slot on @entity86 ’s @entity85			0
there have also been noisy complaints that it was @entity0 ’s supposedly heavy - handed surveillance which drove @entity16 down the path to radicalism - an attack which is both ' unfair and counter-productive ' the drivel about @entity3 was then reinforced by senior @entity95 mp @entity94 on yesterday ’s @entity97 programme on @entity98			1
he rejected the theory that @entity16 had merely gone to @entity60 on ‘ safari ’			1
but he repeated accusations he had already made in the @entity44 ( a paper which has already done deep damage to our national security by publishing intelligence documents leaked by @entity109 traitor @entity107 ) , that @entity0 were guilty of ‘ confusion of aims and ineffective tactics that leave known terrorists to carry out evil deeds and recruit more conspirators ’			1
in his ill - informed contribution , he further suggested that @entity0 should simply arrest jihadis and bring them to trial			2
@entity51 , spokesman for pressure group @entity46 , said @entity16 had been ‘ gentle ’ until he was apparently harassed by @entity0 all this criticism of @entity0 is both unfair and counter-productive			1
the only people who gain from it are the terrorists and their supporters			1
the attack on their work , delivered from the cosiness of media studios , represents little more than the politics of distraction , putting the blame for extremism on those who are trying to defend us , while letting off the zealots who are the real threat			0
the problem with @entity0 is not that it is too interventionist , as @entity46 and many of the chattering classes pretend , but that , because of its lack of resources and powers , it is insufficiently interventionist			1
too often it wants to act as a ‘ fire - fighting unit ’ , where it really needs to be a fire - prevention one			2
but it needs the tools and manpower to do so			0
contrary to all the nonsense talked this week , we should recognise that @entity0 has done a remarkable job in foiling a vast number of @entity50 plots			2
its successes are the terrorist plots that are disrupted and the planes that do n’t get blown out of the sky			0
we do n’t get to hear about these			0
of course , there have been disastrous failures , such as the 2005 @entity26 bombings , and , before this , a reluctance to recognise that @entity162 regarded the entire @entity163 as the enemy , not just the @entity165			0
@entity0 have learned that lesson now ; some say too late			2
i would say better late than never			0
it is now a security service we should and can be proud of			0
@entity0 are still keeping us safe			0
most fair - minded @entity75 people would say : good on them			0
professor @entity174 is director of the @entity175 at the @entity176			0

@entity16 known as extremist before he left to join the @entity180 jihad
critics say @entity0 *'s* heavy surveillance drove @entity16 down path to radicalism
pressure group @entity46 said @entity16 was ‘ gentle ’ before being probed by @entity0
but prof @entity174 says spooking people like @entity16 is ' absolutely necessary '
the only people who gain from criticising @entity0 are terrorists , he claims
