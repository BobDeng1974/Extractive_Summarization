by @entity0 @entity1 spent thousands and took two years to mend a bridge which had been weakened by lorries			1
but when cars finally managed to get back on it they realised many could n’t squeeze through the gap			0
now just a month after reopning drivers are turning round at the tiny width restriction on the road which leads to the bridge – rather than trying to shoehorn their cars in to the tight gap			1
the new measures were put in place to stop vehicles wider than two metres entering an area where large lorries had caused more than £ 30,000 of damage to a bridge			2
even a @entity23 , with a width of 1.7 metres , struggles to navigate the two metre gap in the new road layout but after reopening at the start of the month , swarms of cars have been forced to turn round and find alternative routes - including cars as small as @entity32			1
residents branded it ' ridiculous ' after black tyre marks were left on the pavement by cars narrowly squeezing through the gap			2
the traffic calming measures on @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 , was paid for by @entity43 as part of bridge repairs			0
however , some of the @entity48 's most popular cars , the @entity49 ( width 2.07 metres ) , the @entity51 ( width 2.03 metres ) and even a @entity53 ( 2 metres ) , ca n't fit through the restriction			1
@entity55 , business manager of the dock cafe on neighbouring @entity57 , said : ' within 10 minutes of opening two people hit it , you can see all the black tyre marks on the side			0
' it 's stopping the wrong kind of people , it is n't stopping delivery drivers and white van men who take it at 30 or 40 miles an hour straight through			0
' the restriction was supposed to make things better for the cafe but it really has n't			0
' resident @entity73 , 58 , added : ' i understand there 's a weight limit on the bridge but this is bad for anyone who drives anything big			0
' the design is just ridiculous , this council ca n't spend money quick enough , how much are we spending on this ? ' residents say the new road layout is ' ridiculous ' and watched people hit it within 10 minutes of it opening the road has been designed to stop heavy vehicles using the bridge but cars are being forced to do u-turns the road was previously forced to close when the bridge was damaged by heavy goods vehicles , which were up to six times bigger than the bridge 's three tonne vehicle capacity limit			1
a spokesman for @entity43 and @entity1 said : ' it 's tight but easily negotiated by cars with care at low speed			1
' there 's a weight limit on this bridge - @entity110 are not allowed on it			0
' the narrowing will help ensure the weight limit is obeyed , that @entity114 stay off the bridge , preventing it getting damaged , closing again and causing much worse long - term inconvenience for all drivers			2

@entity1 spent two years mending road bridge damaged by heavy lorries - but many cars ca n't fit
*motorists* are forced to do u-turns at ' ridiculous ' new road layout
