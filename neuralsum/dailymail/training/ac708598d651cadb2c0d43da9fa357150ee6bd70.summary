by @entity0 created : 20:42 est , 24 june 2014 ex-employees have slammed the safety practices of the tour company that conducted the bushwalk at a popular tourist destination in central @entity6 , which resulted in the death of a @entity9 backpacker two weeks ago			1
a 23 - year - old @entity9 woman was killed when she fell 30 metres at @entity11 , 450km west of @entity12 , while doing the rim walk with @entity14			1
it is believed she fell while posing for a photograph at the edge of the canyon , though the specific circumstances of the incident are unknown			0
one of their guides is pictured here leaning over the cliff edge next to a warning sign in august 2013 left : a tour guide holds a tourist over the edge in november 2013			1

right : two tourists pose at the spot in february 2014 former employees of @entity34 in central @entity6 have told @entity40 that the company has a reputation for being ' cowboys ' and that ' it was only a matter of time ' before a death like this happened			2
their criticism comes as photos have emerged of tour guides skylarking at the edges of @entity11 – posing close to the edge and standing on small ledges above 50 metre drops			1
@entity53 , who was a tour guide with the company from march 2011 to april 2012 and returned in march 2014 for five weeks , said he left the company this year because of concerns about their safety practices			1
he told @entity40 that at @entity58 , the area of the walk where it is believed the woman died , walkers regularly pose on a thin ledge , only a metre wide , above a 50 metre drop			2
' there 's actually a bit up near the waterfall where ... guides encourage people to take a photo off the ledge , it 's so dangerous , if you fell that 'd be falling 50 metres , ' he said			2
three tourists pose on the ledge , above a large drop at @entity58 in the rain			0
the photo was posted to @entity77 on april 12 this year a tour guide pretends to stomp on the head of a tourist as he stands on the ledge above a large drop numerous photographs of @entity34 guides and walkers posing on the ledge or posing close to the edge of the canyon , even in the rain when the sandstone would be slippery , have been posted to the @entity90 pages of @entity34 guides , and some have been posted to the company 's facebook page			1
they have since been taken down by the company			0
managing director of @entity34 , @entity95 stated that photographs are uploaded to the company 's @entity90 page by employees and the page is regularly monitored by company management			1
whenever management sees a photograph depicting inappropriate behaviour they remove the picture and talk to the guide in question , he said			0
' we have a three - strikes - you 're - out policy , ' he said and commented that two of the tour guides depicted in the photographs obtained by @entity40 had since been fired or encouraged to leave the company			1
@entity53 added : ' i 'm not surprised there 's been a death on the tour			2
@entity14 has a really bad reputation out there			0
' he claimed that tour guides at the company were given limited training – shadowing another guide for only three tours before they are sent out on their own			1
the itinerary guides follow is also unsafe , he said , with guides required to drive hundreds of kilometres each day and conduct physically demanding walks on five hours sleep each night			0
the @entity14 is based out of @entity12 and has been operating tours in the area since 2007 a tourist ( left ) and a @entity138 ( right ) poses on a ledge while doing the @entity140 at @entity11 another former employee of @entity34 , who preferred not to be named , told @entity40 that the company ' operated like cowboys ' and staff were ' encouraged to be party animals '			1
he said when he worked for the company last year he had conversations with management about their safety practices but ' it was laughed off '			1
' we would never laugh off any concerns about safety , ' @entity95 told @entity40			0
' in eight years of operation we have taken over 3,200 tours to @entity156 , that 's in excess of 82,000 people and until june 15 we were yet to have a fatality , ' he said			0
he disputed the claim that his company is unsafe as the allegations of ' disgruntled ex-employees			1
' mr @entity95 said that guides at the company received excellent training , completing four training trips , and receiving a @entity169 in tour guiding , their senior first aid certificate and a light rigid vehicle license before they were sent out alone			0
he also disputed mr @entity53 's claims about the safety of the itinerary			2
' nowhere during the itinerary is there a five - hour sleep			0
if there is a five - hour sleep it 's because the guide 's not doing the right thing , ' he said			0
on may 8 , a @entity14 bus tipped on its side while travelling on sand at @entity188			0
21 people were on board but no one was injured			0
