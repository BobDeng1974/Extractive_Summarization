by @entity0 @entity2 's referees have gone to war with the @entity4 after demanding a pay rise – and it could lead to the whistlers voting on strike action			1
with @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 now in the @entity13 , match officials have claimed it is unfair for them to receive only the £ 195 standard rate for handling second - tier games while @entity18 matches pay out a whopping £ 840			1
now they have asked for a massive hike to bring them into line with top - flight payments			0
marching orders : referees in @entity2 may refuse to take to the pitch if the dispute is not resolved talks between the authorities inside @entity29 and @entity30 , chairman of the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , have reached an impasse but negotiations may well re-open later this week			0
with finances already tight due to the absence of a sponsor for the football leagues , the @entity4 feel it would be wrong to rubber - stamp any pay increases			0
instead , they have suggested to the @entity32 that they redistribute the annual pot and categorise games - which would see the £ 840 payment reduced in order to facilitate an increase for other fees			2
for example , a @entity12 v @entity10 championship game would be a category a game and receive around £ 700 but a @entity18 game between @entity52 and @entity53 would be @entity54 and be paid £ 335			1
final whistle : with clubs like @entity10 and @entity11 in the second tier officials claim they should be paid more but the @entity32 do not agree with that logic and are holding out for a significant overall pay hike for all @entity13 games , including fixtures such as @entity64 v @entity62			1
the last resort would be for @entity66 and his colleagues to vote on the issue which could result in them pulling out of games			0
it is understood , however , that they only have around 60 per cent of match officials in their union and the bulk are category two and three			0
all parties do not want a repeat of november 2010 when referees voted to go on strike after claiming they were being subjected to a barrage of criticism and having their integrity called into question by senior members within the game			2
they had some sympathy back then but it ’s unlikely that would be the case this time as many football fans will consider them well enough paid at the moment			0
hands up , who want more money ? @entity96 took charge of @entity10 ' game with @entity12 last weekend			1

second tier referees paid just £ 195 - per - game
this *season* 's @entity13 will feature @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity10
officials believe they should be paid more as division grows in *profile*
