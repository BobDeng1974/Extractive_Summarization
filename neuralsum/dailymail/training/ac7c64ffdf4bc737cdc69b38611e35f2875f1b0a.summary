doughnut chain @entity0 has apologised after bizarrely branding a half - term club @entity2 wednesday - the same initials used by the @entity4 race hate group the @entity2			1
a billboard at the @entity7 branch advertised the outlet 's half - term @entity8 ' @entity2 wednesday '			1
but after details appeared on social media the company faced complaints that the initials were the same as the racist group , the @entity2			1
a @entity0 doughnuts store in @entity7 came under fire after customers pointed out one of its half - term activities had taken the initials associated with the @entity2 the @entity2 were a robed and hooded group known for violence against @entity24 in the 19th and 20th centuries and still exists today			1
@entity0 created @entity2 wednesday with the store in @entity28 's @entity27 , @entity7 as part of a calendar of activities designed to keep kids occupied during half term			1
but after posting the event on @entity36 , readers were quick to point out the blunder			2
a member of staff at the @entity7 branch said the advertisement had been taken down			2
she said : ' we have now taken down the sign from our point of sale			2
we do n't have a new name for the event yet but it is still going ahead this week			2
' the club will allow youngsters a chance to decorate their own doughnuts and also other activities			0
the store , based in the @entity28 's shopping centre in @entity7 ( pictured ) , has since removed the advertising the @entity8 hoped to allow children on school holidays to come to the store and decorate snacks @entity0 issued a formal apology and said : ' @entity0 apologises unreservedly for the inappropriate name of a customer promotion at one of our stores			1

' the @entity2 was a racist organisation set up in @entity68 , southern @entity4 in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality			1
believing in white supremacy , the group 's members terrorised political leaders and campaigners , both back and white , who called for greater integration			0
