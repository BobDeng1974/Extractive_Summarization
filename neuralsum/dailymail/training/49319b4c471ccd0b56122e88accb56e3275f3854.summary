by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 20:11 est , 12 april 2013 victory : @entity3 's @entity2 today announced 8,000 people had found work thanks to the benefit cap one in four of those whose benefits were due to be cut as a result of the government ’s cap on state handouts have now found work			1
figures from the @entity2 are the first concrete evidence that the crackdown on welfare is encouraging people to ditch a life of dependency			2
work and pensions secretary @entity3 said they proved his radical reform of the welfare system ‘ is having the desired impact ’			2
from next monday the government will impose an annual cap of £ 26,000 a year – £ 500 a week – on household benefits in four @entity29 boroughs , with the scheme going nationwide in september			1
single people will see their benefits capped at £ 350 a week			2
officials originally predicted that 56,000 would see their benefits cut as a result of the cap , which is pegged to the average earnings of those in work			0
but when the @entity2 wrote to those people warning them that their taxpayer - funded handouts were set to be trimmed , 16,000 of them decided to act			0
some 8,000 potentially capped claimants have now got jobs through @entity44 and another 8,000 of them have dropped off the welfare rolls			0
officials say the latter group are likely to be working in the black economy and have decided to ditch benefits rather than face scrutiny of their earnings			0
while ministers are keen to crack down on the cash - in - hand culture , they are encouraged that so many will no longer be claiming taxpayers ’ money that they do n’t need			0
in total 25,000 of the 56,000 warned they would be hit have accepted help to find a job			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ @entity60 sets a strong incentive for people to move into work and even before the cap comes in we are seeing thousands of people seeking help and moving off benefits			1
back to work : @entity44 has contacted those affected by the cap and helped them find employment ‘ we have a very clear message : we will provide support to those who need it , but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard - working families are over			1
’ he told the @entity83 : ‘ we have to end the crazy situation where people are worse off going to work			0
we need to make going to work the default choice for people , give people an incentive			1
‘ already we ’ve seen 8,000 people who would have been affected by the cap move into jobs			1
this clearly demonstrates that the cap is having the desired impact			0
’ he added : ‘ our @entity44 advisers have been working closely for a year with people who will be affected by the cap , including offering employment support to help people into jobs			1
outrage : the benefit cap is targeted at cases similar to those of @entity105 , an unemployed mother of 11 who is having a £ 400,000 house built for her family at taxpayers ' expense ‘ so far 25,000 people have taken up our offers for help			1
we are engaging people who have never before thought going to work was an option for them			0
’ the government has exempted people on disability benefits from the cap and those on widow ’s pensions			1
nor will it apply if someone in the household is in work and claiming @entity127			0
the statistics will give the @entity130 further ammunition in their battle with @entity132 in the run up to the 2015 general election			1
@entity136 ’s party has opposed every welfare cut made by the @entity138 , but many in his own ranks are concerned that @entity132 ’s soft stance is alienating potential voters			2
mr @entity3 told the @entity83 last night : ‘ the cap will limit benefit claims to the average salary of a working household , at £ 500 a week			2
this is a fair amount			0
fair to the claimant and fair to the taxpayer			0
‘ @entity132 voted against the @entity60			2
i am not clear whether it is giving people an incentive to work that @entity136 and his colleagues object to – or if @entity132 are simply opposed to making sure the welfare system also offers fairness to hard working taxpayers ? that is a question only @entity132 can answer			1

government slashes estimates of how many people will face cap to *40,000*
8,000 have found a job and 8,000 have moved to *cheaper* *accommodation*
*coalition* claims reforms make system fairer but @entity132 calls them cruel
