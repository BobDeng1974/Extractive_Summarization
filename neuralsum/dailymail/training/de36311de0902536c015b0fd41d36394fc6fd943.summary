striking differences have been found between our galaxy , the @entity3 , and its near - twin neighbour , @entity5			1
both are spiral collections of stars with similar structures and look almost identical , despite @entity5 being about twice as large as the @entity3			1
but appearances can be deceptive			0
a new study into the motion of stars has found @entity5 has a history of violence , in contrast to the relatively peaceful @entity3			1
a new study into the motion of stars has found @entity5 ( left ) has a history of violence , in contrast to the relatively peaceful @entity3 ( artists 's impression right ) @entity5 's stars are more disordered than those of our galaxy , probably as a result of clashes and mergers with smaller galaxies			1
such violent histories are thought to be common for large spiral galaxies , with 70 per cent experiencing at least one interaction in the last 10,000 years			1
the apparent orderliness of the @entity3 marks it out as unusual			1
professor @entity36 , from the @entity37 at @entity38 , who led the research using observation data from the @entity41 in @entity42 , said : ' in this context , the motion of the stars in @entity5 's disk is more normal , and the @entity3 may simply be an outlier with an unusually quiescent accretion history			1
' click on the image to zoom in on @entity5 although ' neighbours ' the @entity3 and @entity5 are separated by a distance of 2.5 million light years			2
the two are the largest members of the @entity52 , a collection of 30 galaxies			0
the scientists found that the youngest stars in @entity5 moved in a relatively ordered way around its centre while older stars displayed much more disordered motion			1
previous studies have found evidence of galactic mergers in tidal streams of stars in @entity5 's extended halo			1
they appear to be the remnants of cannibalised dwarf galaxies			0
it ’s widely accepted than in five billion years our @entity3 will collide with the nearby @entity72 - but what will happen when it does ? in a new simulation revealed in september , scientists showed the intricate process that will take place , with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one			2
and the newly formed super-galaxy , dubbed ‘ @entity81 ’ , will also ultimately spell disaster for @entity83 as our planet is flung out into interstellar space			0
the simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) in @entity91			0
in the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other			0
first , in a tentative meeting , they will ‘ swoop ’ past each other , possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy			2
then , after separating , the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again			0
as @entity5 is larger than the @entity3 , with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter , it will technically be the one ‘ eating ’ our galaxy			1
the @entity3 is also expected to ‘ eat ’ two nearby dwarf galaxies , the large and @entity110 , at some point in the future			2
the findings were presented at the winter meeting of the @entity115 in @entity116 earlier this week the sharpest and largest image ever taken of the @entity72 - the nearest spiral galaxy to our @entity3 - has been revealed by astronomers			2
it shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy ’s pancake - shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light - years			0
the sweeping view , which reveals one third of our galactic neighbour , also suggests that the galaxy may have been battered by a collision with another galaxy two billion years ago			0
@entity133 of the @entity134 in @entity116 told @entity135 that the image hints at an older wave of starbirth that had previously only been spotted in one area of @entity5			0
‘ no one would have guessed it was galaxy - wide ’ , he said , suggesting there may have been a major collision in the galaxy ’s history			0
although ' neighbours ' the @entity3 ( pictured ) and @entity5 are separated by 2.5 million light years			2

study found @entity5 's stars are more disordered than our galaxy 's
this may be the result of clashes and mergers with smaller galaxies
such violent histories are thought to be common for large spiral galaxies
the orderliness of the @entity3 marks it out as different , scientists say
