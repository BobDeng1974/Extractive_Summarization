by @entity0 they are only a few inches tall , but these two wild crane chicks come with very high hopes			1
the pair of hatchlings are the first new generation of wild cranes seen in western @entity8 in 400 years			1
it is a huge success for conservationists after sustained efforts to reintroduce @entity8 ’s tallest birds to their wetland habitats			1
chicks : this pair of hatchlings are the first new generation of wild cranes seen in western @entity8 in 400 years the wild crane , which stands four feet tall , was once commonplace in the south - west			1
but the bird was considered a vital part of the medieval banquet table - and cranes were hunted to extinction by the 1600s			1
the two chicks hatched at the @entity27 reserve in @entity28			2
parent birds @entity29 and @entity31 , which were hand - reared as part of the @entity34 reintroduction scheme , tried to breed last year but a chick died in bad weather before leaving the nest			0
hello , mum ! the chicks hatched at the @entity27 reserve in @entity28			2
above , one of the hatchlings with its mother this year two healthy chicks have been spotted on their first walk away from the nest , as their parents fed them on grubs			2
so far they have stayed close to the nest site , which indicates there is plenty of food around for them			0
that is encouraging for the youngsters as cranes usually hatch two chicks but one will perish if food is scarce			2
@entity59 , the trust ’s head of conservation breeding , said the chick ’s arrival was incredibly exciting			0
pleased : tv naturalist @entity65 described the chicks ' arrival as ' a wonderful story ' he hopes it will be part of a new generation of wild cranes			1
‘ there ’s been an overwhelmingly positive response to the return of the cranes from people across the west of @entity8 , ’ he said			1
‘ they are a fantastic advert for restoring wetland habitats			0
’ some cranes have regained a foothold in @entity83 and nearly 80 have been reintroduced to western @entity8 in the past four years			1
they have been a strong draw for visitors to @entity28 , where volunteers have dressed in crane costumes to hand rear chicks			2
tv naturalist @entity65 said : ‘ it is a wonderful story			0
they started reintroducing cranes to @entity93 four years ago , bringing them over from @entity95			2
‘ they were hand raised and then released on the @entity98			0
but quite bizarrely they have flown back to @entity93 to breed , back to the place they were raised			0
they must have some kind of homing signal			0
’ mr @entity59 first spotted the chick on a webcam trained on the nest			0
he said : ‘ it ’s incredibly exciting to be on the cusp of a new generation of totally wild cranes that will hopefully start to recolonise parts of @entity8 that have n’t seen cranes for four centuries			1
‘ the chick hatching last year confirmed that the cranes we hand - reared were physically able to breed			0
‘ this year we ’ve got everything crossed that everything goes in their favour and they can rear this chick			0
’ @entity125 of the @entity126 added : ‘ the young cranes are learning and adapting to their new home in the @entity8 and are still searching for suitable sites to successfully rear their young			1
’ in 1215 , @entity130 ( pictured ) and his guests ate an incredible 115 cranes at his @entity134 feast in @entity135 wild cranes are @entity8 ’s tallest bird , standing four feet tall and with an eight - foot wing span			1
they were once common in @entity8 , but they were driven to extinction by hunters catching them for their meat and the draining of their wetlands habitats			1
before the birds completely disappeared hunting cranes became the preserve of the nobility and a tax was put on the collection of their eggs			0
in 1215 , @entity130 and his guests ate an incredible 115 cranes at his @entity134 feast in @entity135 , alongside an array of bitterns and ducks , and during a feast to enthrone archbishop @entity159 in the fifteenth century , the guests consumed 204 birds			0
hundreds of towns and villages in the @entity8 have the element ‘ cran ’ in their name - such as @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 - because they were known for having large populations of cranes			1
scientists believe crane footprints found in the @entity175 suggest they were breeding in large numbers in @entity8 as far back as the @entity178 era – around 11,000 years ago			1
the oldest ever crane was a @entity180 named @entity181 who died at the ripe old age of 83 , according to the @entity184			0
most cranes live to 20 years			2
in @entity187 , the crane is regarded as a symbol of good fortune and longevity because of its fabled life span of a thousand years			2
it also represents fidelity as @entity187 cranes are known to mate for life .			0

hatchlings were born at @entity199 reserve
