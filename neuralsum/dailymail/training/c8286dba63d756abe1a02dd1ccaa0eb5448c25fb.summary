speaking earlier this month , the prime minister told the @entity107 : ‘ today if you travel and work from another @entity18 country into @entity4 , you can then claim child benefit and other benefits for your family back at home even though actually they ’re not living in the @entity4 and going to @entity4 schools and all the rest of it			1
‘ and under the current rules , it seems extremely difficult , if not impossible , to change that			0
now i have n’t met anybody who thinks this is sensible … so that is again a really big change			2
’ the government insists that the ‘ main purpose of child benefit is to support families in the @entity4 ’			2

i think that a common market does not mean we have a common benefits system			0
‘ i do n’t believe that anybody coming in from the @entity7 should get any benefits at all until they are more permanently settled in this country			2
