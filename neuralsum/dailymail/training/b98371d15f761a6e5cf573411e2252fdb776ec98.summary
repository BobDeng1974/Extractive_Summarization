@entity0 insists reviving the wing - back formation could hold the key to @entity4 's chances of @entity6 survival			1
the former @entity8 boss admitted surprise at the number of national sides favouring a return to 3 - 5 - 2 in @entity14 's summer @entity13			1
@entity0 delayed @entity16 ' move to three at the back last term , but now feels confident he has the personnel to pull off the notoriously tricky set - up			1
' @entity26 should be perfect , that 's what he is , a wing - back , he 's not a left - back really , ' said @entity0 , ahead of saturday 's league opener against @entity41 at @entity42			1
' he 's half a left - back and half a left winger really			1
' so really he 's a wing - back , that 's what he does , so it 's perfect for him			1
' and @entity28 should be the same on the left side , he 's an attacking player who can run all day			2
' so i 've got two people on the left side , and i 've got @entity33 and @entity34 on the right			1
' @entity34 can play three or four positions , because he can play anywhere in midfield			2
' so he 's a good acquisition			0
' @entity58 boss @entity57 has ushered in a back - three system at @entity60 , with the long - defunct formation making an unlikely comeback			1
@entity0 does not expect the @entity6 to be awash with wing - backs as in the mid-nineties , but admitted it remains a formation he favours			1
the 67 - year - old pledged to dispense with his plan if the changes fail to bear fruit , but warned his squad to cope with the new tactical blueprint			0
' the players will just be pleased to be playing , they should n't worry too much about the formation , ' said @entity0 , keen to field two strikers without sacrificing midfield bite			2
' at the end of the day , whatever the system , they get on with it			0
' they 've got to play and get on with it : if they do n't , then unlucky really			0
' it was difficult to do it last year as we did n't quite have the players			0
@entity86 of class : @entity58 boss @entity57 is expected to use the 3 - 5 - 2 sytem that he served him well in @entity14 ' it was a surprise to see so many teams playing that way at the @entity13 , but it was in my mind long , long before the @entity13 to play that way			1
' it 's a system i 've always liked			2
' hopefully it 's something that can work for us , and certainly our first objective of course is to try to stay in the league			0
' there will probably only be two or three teams playing that way in the league			0
' it enables you to get two strikers in the team			0
' people have had problems getting two strikers in because unless you play 4 - 4 - 2 you 're getting overrun with two midfield players			2
' so that is a problem if the other team play with three in there , and that 's why most teams play with one striker these days			0
' this way it enables you to get three midfielders and two strikers			0
' meeting of minds : the @entity4 boss has hailed new coach @entity128 's impact at @entity42 @entity0 hailed new first team coach @entity128 's immediate impact - but rejected suggestions the former @entity8 midfielder is his long - term managerial successor at the west @entity134 club			1
@entity128 is the second former @entity135 manager to work in @entity0 's @entity16 backroom staff after @entity137			1
the @entity139 boss said he does not envisage stepping out of frontline management in the near future			0
' for years i 've felt it was an absolute waste , for someone of @entity128 's knowledge and ability not to be working out on the training ground with players every day			2
' so when the opportunity came i rung him up , and asked him if he 'd be interested			0
' we had a couple of meetings and he said he was well up for it , so i could n't be more pleased			0
' i had @entity156 previously , so i 've had two former @entity135 managers now - and they are one million per cent my appointments			2
getting ready : @entity159 ( c ) trains ahead of @entity4 's opening @entity6 game against @entity41 ' no - one at the club suggested @entity128 to me , it was totally my call			1
' obviously when i went to speak to @entity137 i had the same problem as with @entity128 - would they fancy it having been @entity135 manager ? ' @entity137 did it and he was great while he was here , before going off to manage @entity171 , and now @entity128 's come in and i could n't be more pleased			1
' i 've not had enough , that 's way down the line and it would n't be my decision as to when i finish anyway			0
' @entity128 's here to get out on the training pitch and work with the players			2

@entity4 's survival could rest on a return to 3 - 5 - 2 system , says @entity0

@entity0 has *praised* the impact of coach @entity128 at @entity42
@entity128 is second former @entity135 manager to work under @entity0 after @entity137
