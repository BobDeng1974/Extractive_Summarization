by @entity0 a fireman saved a family when their car caught fire on the way to the airport - then gave them a lift to make sure they caught their flight			1
@entity12 spotted smoke and flames coming from a people carrier as he drove behind it up the @entity17			1
after using his flashing lights to pull them over , he single - handedly moved them to safety , directed traffic around from the fire - then drove them in his own car the rest of the way to @entity26			2
mr @entity12 was only driving back up the @entity17 because he had just been at @entity55 in @entity56 meeting a delegation of firefighters - visiting from @entity38			1
mr @entity12 , station manager at @entity60 fire station , said : ' i was driving back from seeing visitors from @entity38 at control when i saw the @entity28 ahead			1
' first there was smoke coming out the engine , then flames started dropping down from it			0
' i put my lights on to flash them to pull over and as soon as they stopped and oxygen pooled around the engine compartment , it went up in a flash			0
' i was trying to ring it in to control and the family were trying to get all their luggage out the boot			2
' after rescuing the family , mr @entity12 , pictured , managed the scene until his colleagues arrived with a fire engine he continued : ' i helped them with that , then got them back from the area , put my safety gear on and went to warn other motorists			1
' i was trying to move cars from lane one when highway services arrived			0
' the car was just a shell , but the family and their friend seemed quite positive - they were just happy they were all ok			2
' if the car had exploded or fumes had come in through the ventilation system the outcome could obviously have been very different			0
' luckily , i had a people carrier with me so i got them and their luggage to the airport in time			0
it was just an extra piece in my crazy day			0
' the family , whose names were not recorded by the fire service , were happy to pose for a snap with mr @entity12 at the airport			1
a relative of the driver has since contacted the firefighter to thank him .			0
