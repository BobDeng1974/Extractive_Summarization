by @entity1 reporter published : 13:54 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 16:04 est , 12 june 2013 an hilarious @entity3 video purporting to be a reference to support a job application for @entity6 features ' @entity7 ' in a convincing appeal for employment - even @entity9 is apparently on his side			1
the video begins with a written explanation : ' in 2011 , @entity7 applied for a job at @entity6			2
he sent in this video			0
' @entity7 wants to be a post-production production assistant at @entity6 , and he believes he 's got the chops for the job			1
but do n't take his word for it - @entity9 has a few things to say on his behalf			2
living the dream : @entity23 showed off his production skills by cleverly editing an old interview to make it look like he and @entity9 had an intimate tete - a - tete regarding @entity29 's job prospects in a cleverly spliced old interview with @entity9 , @entity7 , who identifies himself as @entity23 , extracts some high praise from the director , screenwriter , producer - and co-founder of @entity6 movie studios			1
' why , hello there @entity9 , ' he says , glancing meaningfully at the camera			0
' you look great , by the way ... you have n't aged a day since 1993 , ' in reference to the interview footage , which appears to be an old @entity44 @entity43 interview from around the time of the release of @entity9 's acclaimed @entity48 in 1993			1
@entity7 asks @entity9 if he could endorse him for a job at @entity6 , to which @entity9 responds , ' i can			1
and i can without shame			0
' aged well : it 's unclear if @entity9 has seen the video , which uses an old @entity44 interview from 1993 , but according to the video 's conclusion , @entity23 has been banned from working at @entity6 in response to @entity7 's question about his best qualities , @entity9 decides it 's @entity7 's ' wondrous eyes ' , and the ' energy of @entity64 when she was in her 70s ' , referring to the @entity67 actress dubbed the @entity68 of @entity69			1
' that 's a strange example , ' say @entity7			0
' but yes , i have infectious energy , i 'm kind of always working hard , ' he concedes			0
when it comes to thinking of @entity7 's worst , @entity9 appears stumped			1
' take your time , ' @entity7 encourages him gently			0
he ca n't come up with anything , so they move onto their friendship			0
job seeker : @entity7 has not been successful in his bid for a job at @entity6 so far , but the company has remained silent on whether or not @entity9 cried ' we went out together , we went to each other 's houses together , we complain together - ' begins @entity9			1
' mostly about @entity87 , ' interjects @entity7 , referring to @entity9 's rival @entity88			0
' of course , ' grins @entity9			0
the final part of the interview moves to a more emotional plane , as @entity9 discusses his fear that @entity7 wo n't come and work at @entity6			2
' @entity9 , if i do n't come and work for you , will you cry ? ' asks @entity7			2
' yes , ' replies @entity9 softly , appearing to hold back deep emotion			0
to uplifting music , @entity7 appears with a glass of wine raised to the camera and text across the screen exhorts @entity6 : ' @entity103 as post production assistant			1
@entity9 will cry if you do n't			2
' incredibly , even after the amazing reference of @entity9 and those wondrous eyes , it appears @entity7 has not been hired by @entity6			1
perhaps he should put some feelers out to @entity88 .			0

@entity23 made the hilarious video as a reference in support of a job application
@entity9 appears to *wholeheartedly* endorse the production assistant 's bid - even saying he *'ll* cry if @entity23 does n't get the job
as yet , @entity23 has not scored a job with @entity6
