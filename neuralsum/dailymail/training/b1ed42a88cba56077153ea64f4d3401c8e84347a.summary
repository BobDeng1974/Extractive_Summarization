his body was found on the pavement of @entity19 , @entity20 , in south - west @entity10			1
@entity21 heard the stowaway may have been dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off , or because of the extreme cold at high altitude			2
detectives analysed a sim card found in his jeans and contacted the phone numbers that were stored on it in a bid to identify him			1
detective sergeant @entity38 , from the @entity37 , told the inquest that officers contacted a woman in @entity42 who had exchanged text messages with mr @entity1			1
the woman , referred to during the hearing as ms @entity45 , told police mr @entity1 had worked for her family as a housekeeper and gardener in @entity50 and had spoken to her about travelling to @entity12			1
she told officers that although she had done nothing to facilitate his trip , she knew mr @entity1 had ' desired to travel to @entity12 for a better life ' , mr @entity38 said			1
police had originally thought mr @entity1 , also known as @entity56 , was @entity16 because of currency found in his pockets			2
a post-mortem gave the cause of death as multiple injuries			0
coroner dr @entity63 recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
detectives initially believed mr @entity1 was from @entity16 as he had the country 's currency on him when he was found in the street in @entity20 , pictured mr @entity1 turned 26 on the day he fell , the inquest heard			1
he was wearing light clothing and had a tattoo on his left arm with the letters ' z ' and ' g ' clearly visible , the hearing was told			0
residents in @entity19 described hearing a ' thud ' shortly before the @entity82 flight was due to land at 7.45am , @entity78 said			0
' the spread of body matter suggested the body had fallen from some height , ' he added			0
the incident was initially treated as a possible violent assault due to the nature of the man ’s injuries , the hearing was told			0
aviation experts say mr @entity1 was probably dead before he hit the ground either from cold or from being crushed by the wheels after take off ( file picture ) forensic pathologist dr @entity97 told the inquest that mr @entity1 had suffered ' very severe injuries ' , particularly to his head			2
there was damage to his skull and brain , fractures to his spine , pelvis , left arm and right shin and various other marks and injuries , he added			0
dr @entity97 said the extremely low temperatures of between minus @entity122 ( minus @entity120 ) and minus @entity121 ( minus @entity119 ) , the lack of oxygen at high altitude and the dangers of the plane ’s retracting landing gear may have caused mr @entity1 ’s death before his body hit the ground			1
' the man was either very close to the point of death or dead before the time he struck the ground , ' he said			0
dr @entity97 said he had only dealt with two previous incidents of stowaways falling from planes in his career			0
