the 298 passengers and crew aboard @entity3 will have been oblivious to the horror as a shrapnel - based missile instantly shredded the plane , experts claim			1
the sa - 11 missile - known as a @entity8 - that hit the doomed @entity10 flight is designed to pulverise aircraft on impact			1
it will have perforated the plane at various points , ignited the fuel , and taken out the engines and the wings within a split second - meaning the people aboard will have been unconscious almost instantly			1
the launcher , an armoured truck , takes up position and once its crew have acquired the target , it takes five minutes for the first missle to be launched			0
the surface - to - air missile hit the @entity46 with such force that residents in the area claim to have seen bodies falling from the sky ‘ like rags ’			1
@entity53 , researcher analyst at the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , told @entity55 : ' an sa - 11 missile is designed to shred aircraft			1
' the extent at which the remains of the aircraft are spread across a large area seems to confirm that			2
' the missile is programmed using a tracker to get within a metre of the target then let off a ring of shrapnel , which will enter the aircraft at various points			1
' the shrapnel will have hit the wings , the engines and the fuel tanks , igniting the fuel			1
' a large aircraft like that is highly pressurised to allow humans to breathe at that altitude so it will have exploded instantly			1
decimated : a pro-russian separatist looks at wreckage from the nose section of a @entity10 @entity46 plane which was downed near the village of @entity86 emergency workers , police officers and even coal miners spread out across the sunflower fields and villages of eastern @entity92 , searching the wreckage of @entity3 @entity94 : a @entity92 covers a body with a plastic sheet in a field			2
@entity99 's prime minister said there was no distress call before the plane went down and that the flight route was declared safe by the @entity104 all hand on deck : coal miners help with the search effort at the crash site near the village of @entity86 in eastern @entity92 disturbing : a woman walks past a body covered with a plastic sheet in a sunflower field near the site of a crashed @entity10 passenger plane near the village of @entity86 @entity3 was believed to have been taken down by an sa - 11 missile , known as a @entity8 in the @entity119 , or a @entity35 in @entity120			1
the surface - to - air missile has a range of 1.8 to 12.4 miles and can hit targets up to an altitude of 75,000ft			1
it is launched from a command vehicle using a target - acquisition radar			2
once a target has been selected it takes five minutes to warm up			0
depending on the model , the missile would then accelerate to at least 2,790ft per second to up to 4,035ft per second			2
this means it would have reached @entity134 at 33,000ft high just eight seconds after being fired			0
' almost nobody on board would have known what was happening			0
if not instantly , they will have been unconscious within split seconds			2
' speculation over the source of the missile , which remains unconfirmed , has sparked a propaganda battle between both sides of the @entity92 - @entity120 crisis			2
officials in @entity147 have made repeated statements linking the attack to @entity151 separatists			0
tonight , @entity152 supported the claims with a statement to say it appears ' increasingly likely that @entity155 was shot down by a separatist missile ' fired from near @entity157 , an area controlled by @entity151 rebels			2
naked bodies were strewn across fields in eastern @entity92 surrounded by hundreds of possessions - including children 's books , playing cards , slippers , letters and old vinyl records - after the missile strike shortly after 1pm on thursday			2
makeshift white flags marked where bodies lay in corn fields and among the debris			0
others , stripped bare by the force of the crash , had been covered by polythene sheeting weighed down by stones , one marked with a flower in remembrance			0
one pensioner told how a corpse smashed though the roof of her house			0
' there was a howling noise and everything started to rattle			0
then objects started falling out of the sky , ' said @entity190 , 65			0
' and then i heard a roar and she landed in the kitchen			0
' the @entity35 missile system , also known as the @entity35 , was created by the @entity195 in 1979 to engage aircraft , cruise missiles and drones			1
@entity35 - which means ' beech tree ' in @entity120 - includes four missiles on a turntable mounted on a tracked vehicle			1
a separate tracked vehicle carries radars to guide the missiles			0
capable of carrying 154lbs ( 70kg ) of highly - explosive warheads , @entity35 can send missiles up to an altitude of 75,000ft ( 23,000 metres )			1
it takes just five minutes to warm up , 12 minutes to reload and 8 - 12 seconds to reach its target			0
once there , it has a kill probability of 90 to 95 per cent			0
yesterday 's missile is likely to have detonated within 65 feet ( 20 metres ) of @entity3 , causing critical damage to the engines and control system of the aircraft			1
the explosion would have ignited the fuel onboard the aircraft , causing destruction of the wing and fuselage			2
‘ inside the missile is a variety of different warheads , ’ a senior defence source told @entity55			0
‘ these can be fragmentation or incendiary , depending on the target you are flying at			0
they can cut an aircraft in half , set it on fire or provide large pieces of shrapnel that shred it apart			2
’ personal belongings and luggage of @entity3 passengers found at the crash site in eastern @entity92 disturbing : dead bodies were found mixed in with debris , with some corpses having remained almost intact a pro-russian militant inspects the crash site , which stretched for over nine miles a piece of wreckage of the @entity3 in @entity253 , the day after it crashed many belongings were completely undamaged , with t - shirts , suitcase the missile - thought to be the @entity260 semi-active homing @entity258 - was launched from the back of what is essentially a truck and has a range of 1.8 to 12.4 miles ( 3 to 20km )			1
a 13.8 - inch ( 35cm ) ‘ seeker ’ on the missile would have received information on the trajectory of the passenger aircraft from a radar station on a separate vehicle			1
a typical battery to launch the missile is made up of command vehicle housing computers and displays			0
the system used to determine whether a target is a friend or foe would not warn an operator that the target was an airliner - only that it was not a friend			0
a tracked variant of the @entity35 missile launching system on display last year at celebrations in @entity288 for the anniversary of the end of @entity291 both tracked and wheeled versions of the launcher can fire a volley of four missiles in quick succession , each targeting a different aircraft			1
a video released today by the @entity300 shows a tracked @entity35 missile launcher which the @entity147 government claims was used to bring down @entity134			1
one of the missiles on the launcher appears to be missing as it was driven through the town of @entity306 , towards the @entity120 border .			0

shrapnel - based @entity35 missile , known as a @entity8 , will have ' shredded ' the plane on impact , expert says
will have perforated wings , engines , fuel tanks , and highly - pressurised cabin , which will have exploded ' instantly '
passengers will have been ' oblivious ' to hit , claims @entity53 , aircraft expert at @entity54
