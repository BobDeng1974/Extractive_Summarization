former secretary of state @entity1 ’s tepid endorsement this week of president @entity4 ’s decision to swap five @entity6 detainees for an @entity8 soldier held hostage by terrorists is raising red flags among parties familiar with her position on the issue when she was in the president ’s cabinet			1
asked monday about the release of sgt. @entity20 , @entity18 refused to levy criticism at her former boss for trading terrorists for the soldier , who professed unpatriotic views of his country and willing left his post on the night the @entity29 captured him			1
‘ this young man , whatever the circumstances , was an @entity8 citizen – is an @entity8 citizen , was serving in our military , ’ @entity18 told her audience during a lecture in @entity34 , @entity35			2
‘ i do n't believe in second guessing people who have to make these hard choices , ’ she said of the ‘ tough ’ decision @entity4 made			2
the former @entity4 administration official may be second - guessing her own choices , however			1
her support for @entity20 's freedom conflicts with descriptions of her perspective three years ago			1
@entity51 : secretary of states @entity1 lobbied the @entity53 against trading five @entity29 leaders for sgt. @entity20 , but potential presidential candidate @entity1 now refuses to criticize the @entity4 @entity53 's deal sent home : video released by the @entity29 and obtained from the ' @entity59 ' website shows @entity20 prepared to be handed over to @entity60 on saturday in a 2012 @entity63 article , journalist @entity61 described @entity18 as being ' very wary about making a swap for @entity20			1
' @entity61 , now deceased , insinuated that @entity18 and then - secretary of defense @entity65 did n't want to make the trade because they did n't want the @entity8 's counter-insurgency strategy , the @entity70 troop surge , to be viewed as unsuccessful			1
' @entity65 and @entity1 do n't give a s * * * about getting him home , ' a senior @entity8 official with knowledge of the negotiations reportedly told @entity75			2
' they want to be able to say they coined their way out of @entity70 , or whatever , so it does n't look like they are cutting and running			0
' a @entity18 spokesman did not return @entity83 's request on tuesday to confirm @entity75 ’ characterization of the former secretary of state ’s previous views on @entity20 ’s release , and a follow - up question asking what had changed @entity18 ’s thinking			1
since then , three former administration officials familiar with @entity18 ’s position on the issue when she worked at the @entity95 told @entity96 that @entity18 was in fact ‘ wary ’ of making a deal , and that her unwillingness to make the trade stemmed from distrust of the @entity29 or @entity20 ’s captors , the @entity102 in @entity103			1
‘ she was heavily involved from the beginning , she was very skeptical of the arrangement , she was very wary of it , ’ one official said			0
‘ if we had come to some agreement she perhaps would have backed it , but we never got to that point			0
’ ‘ she was felt that the @entity102 were really bad guys , ’ @entity116 congressman @entity115 said			0
‘ she was reluctant to enter into negotiations with them			0
’ three intelligence officials also confirmed to the @entity96 that then - secretary of defense @entity65 was also against the deal , as was director of national intelligence @entity123 , who still serves in the administration			2
if @entity18 had her way , they said , the @entity8 would have released three of the detainees as a show of good faith , and released the other two prisoners 60 days later			2
at that point @entity20 would have been released as well			0
it begins : @entity18 has attracted controversy since her days as first lady , but with a likely presidential run in her future conservatives are ramping up the pressure ; this pair demonstrated against her outside a @entity34 , @entity35 speaking engagement on june 2 @entity18 ’s plan would have also required the @entity147 government to surveil the released @entity29 fighters , and the prisoners would n’t have been allowed to travel out of @entity147 ‘ until there was peace , ’ the @entity96 reported			1
‘ break ties with @entity153 , renounce violence , and abide by the @entity70 constitution , and you can rejoin @entity70 society , ’ @entity18 told the @entity29 in 2011			0
‘ refuse and you will continue to face the consequences of being tied to @entity153 as an enemy of the international community			0
’ the plan that president @entity4 ultimately went with only slaps the released @entity29 fighters with a one - year travel ban			1
other details of the deal are being kept secret			0
the fact that we are going to be pulling out of @entity70 shortly meant that the likelihood of retrieving @entity20 was diminishing , ’ rep. @entity115 said			0
‘ and once the war in @entity70 is over , some will argue that we no longer have a legal right to detain the @entity29			0
’ @entity115 , now in his twelfth term in @entity176 , is retiring at the end of this year , and has less to lose from sharing sacred details of the @entity4 administration ’s talks with the @entity29 than many of his colleagues , who may have to work with @entity18 , a presumed 2016 candidate and frontrunner , again some day			1
@entity20 ( r , with pipe ) was photographed in @entity70 a month after he walked away from his post and into the arms of the @entity29 ; the @entity53 traded away what one senator called ' the @entity29 dream team ' to get him back @entity18 ’s comments on monday about the delicateness of negotiations do not directly contradict with her past sentiments , as described by others			1
‘ you do n’t want to see these five prisoners go back to combat			0
there ’s a lot that you do n’t want to have happen			0
on the other hand you also do n’t want an @entity8 citizen , if you can avoid it , especially a solider , to die in captivity , ’ @entity18 said			2
selective memory : @entity18 dished to @entity208 this week about her aspirations , her health and her marriage , but did n't touch on the history of how @entity20 's release was negotiated ‘ i think we have a long way to go before we really know how this is going to play out			1
’ but @entity18 did not come out and disparage the plan , which she was reportedly against as secretary of state , either			2
@entity18 may have decided not to vocalize her disappointment with the deal after secretly meeting with president @entity4 late last week			1
lawmakers believe its possible that @entity4 discussed his already announced decision to pull troops out of @entity70 with @entity18 , as well has the @entity20 deal , as the meet - up came just two days before @entity20 was officially released by the @entity29			1
‘ it would be ' fair game ' to ask @entity18 if she did indeed know about the trade before it took place , @entity231 sen. @entity230 told @entity237			0
‘ “ did she know about this , what does she think about it , does she agree with the decision to withdraw troops in 2016 ? ” ’ ‘ these are all really good questions potential candidates for president need to answer , ’ he said			0
' this has ramifications long term for the @entity8 , this prisoner swap			0
’ ' if mrs. @entity1 remains politically active , people will want to know what her advice was on the subject , ' @entity251 sen. @entity250 , who sits on the @entity252 , said			0
if @entity4 did tell @entity18 , ' it would be outrageous that he notified someone who 's outside government before he would even notify members of @entity176 , ’ @entity258 sen. @entity257 told @entity83			2
neither @entity4 ’s nor @entity18 ’s camps will give out details on the meet - up other than to say @entity4 and @entity18 had an ' informal ' lunch at the @entity53 .			1

on monday former secretary of state @entity1 tepidly endorsed president @entity4 's decision to trade five terrorists for an @entity8 solider being held hostage by the @entity29
asked about the deal that secured sgt. @entity20 's freedom , @entity18 declined to ' second - guess ' the president 's ' tough ' decision
@entity18 's attitude now does n't line up with her opinion as secretary of state , former @entity4 administration officials say
as a member of @entity4 's cabinet , @entity18 was reportedly ' wary ' of negotiating with the @entity29
the presumed 2016 presidential candidate may have decided to soften her criticism of @entity4 's position after the two met for a clandestine @entity53 lunch last week , just two days before @entity20 was released
