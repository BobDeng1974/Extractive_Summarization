the houseboats , floating lodges and beach houses are to be crafted from reclaimed materials from a previous project by designers @entity12			1
the company had originally used the idea to build a dome to protect radar and radio antennae for a new landmark cruise liner terminal in @entity19			2
but they decided to give the concept a ' second life ' after spending so much time creating , developing and sourcing material			0
@entity25 have designed a series houseboats , floating lodges and beach houses which are in the shape of an egg managing director @entity31 said @entity25 looked at ways to use the two moulds which formed the dome			1
they examined the prospect of using them as swimming pools and temporary stages , but ended up creating the waterborne and coastal structures			0
the buildings , which are the first models in the @entity44 series , were designed by @entity31 and @entity45 of @entity46			1
the first plan is for a floating lodge in the shape of the mould 's original egg - like structure			1
the idea for the buildings came from a previous project to build a dome to protect radar and radio antennae for a cruise liner terminal in @entity19 a spokesman said : ' expansive but shaded windows flood the 6m high lounge with light from either side , while decking creates easy access to the water			1
' the luxury space is envisaged as easily at home along lake or river side , or a part of a cluster hotel or studio development			0
' the high levels of roof insulation , moderation of temperature from its water setting and potential addition of solar panels to the expansive roof creates a sustainable unit for all climates			0
' taking the concept a step further the design team went for a houseboat			0
the team even designed a houseboat , which was achieved by ' cracking ' the egg this was achieved by ' cracking ' the egg , raising and separating the top shell , which has been sculpted to form a terracotta roof edged with flowing curves			2
this has created an airy loft style houseboat with stepped mezzanine levels leading up to a master bedroom , featuring expansive views through full height windows			0
mr @entity31 said the shape provided a number of exciting opportunities			2
he said : ' in the same way that an egg provides a flexible base for many recipes , we see countless opportunities in the development of this design for private or commercial use			2
