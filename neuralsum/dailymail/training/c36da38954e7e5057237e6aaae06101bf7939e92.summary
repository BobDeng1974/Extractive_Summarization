by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 06:06 est , 31 october 2012 the soaring cost of childcare means millions of families face two decades of stagnant living standards , a landmark report warns today			0
the @entity6 on @entity7 says that even if the economy recovers , around a third of the working age population – some 11million people – will be no better off in 2020 than they were in 2000			1
among the worst hit are mothers because the cost of childcare is so high they can not afford to go back to work			2
no improvement : older workers are one of the groups who are likely to suffer a decline or stagnation in living standards until 2020 older workers and youngsters without qualifications also face an uncertain future as they struggle to make ends meet			0
the report says : ‘ millions of households are heading for a long period of stagnant living standards			0
' the outlook for the bottom half of the working population is bleak even once growth returns			0
’ the @entity6 , set up by the @entity37 in early 2010 , warns that many women with children can not afford to go back to work			1
no benefit : work does not pay for many women in @entity44 , says @entity6 on @entity7 it shows that a full - time second earner with two young children in a typical middle income household on a salary of £ 19,550 keeps just £ 1,060 a year after childcare costs , taxes and lost benefits			1
that is only £ 20 a week			0
in a worst - case example , a family with one parent on the minimum wage and a second earner returning to work full - time on the same salary would be left with only £ 211 a year – £ 4 a week – from the second parent ’s wage after childcare costs and loss of tax credits were taken into account			2
‘ @entity42 simply does not pay for many women in modern @entity44 , ’ says the report			1
@entity67 , deputy chief executive of the foundation , said : ‘ we need major change in our childcare system to ensure that work is always worthwhile – and that working more hours or a pay rise results in higher take home pay			2

work does not pay for many @entity44 women says @entity6
