falling sperm counts could be caused by traces of the contraceptive pill in drinking water , a new study has claimed			1
@entity6 scientists say the sex hormone oestradiol - the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants - has an even larger effect on sperm than @entity12 or @entity12 , as it is widely known			1
@entity12 is found in some plastics used to make food containers , bottles and coatings in tin cans , and is also commonly used in thermal paper in cash register receipts			1
the chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in @entity34 because of safety fears			0
but the transparent resin is still used to line most plastic and tin food packaging - despite the calls for an all - out ban by campaigners			2
the @entity42 says strict regulations mean that the health risk from food packaging is minimal			0
the @entity46 banned @entity12 from baby bottles in 2012 , but said there was not enough evidence for a wider ban and has found the chemical safe at low levels			1
however in the new study , @entity54 geneticists found a direct link between @entity12 and disrupted sperm production			1
writing in the journal @entity59 , they say the chemical disrupts the delicate dna interactions needed to create sperm			1
in addition to the @entity12 effects , principle investigator dr @entity62 saw an even larger effect on sperm by oestradiol , the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants			1
she believes she and her team may have unearthed the reason why numerous studies have revealed sperm counts are falling			1
the issue has been a subject of concern and since the early 1990s , when @entity79 researchers reported ' a genuine decline in semen quality over the past 50 years , ' with possible implications for male fertility			1
trail : the researchers saw an even larger effect on sperm by oestradiol , the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants two years ago , a large @entity91 study warned that sperm counts are falling at an alarming rate - up to 38 per cent in a decade - with diet and lifestyle largely to blame			1
researchers from the @entity97 found that even in young men , sperm concentration fell by an average of two per cent a year - and could soon hit levels where fertility is compromised			2
dr @entity62 , author of the new study , has a long history of working with @entity12 , which is often found in plastic bottles , the linings of food and beverage cans , and thermal receipts			1
much of her work has documented its effect on female reproduction , from mice to monkeys			0
she argues the study also bolsters the hypothesis that ' oestrogen ' disruptors in the environment are at play			2
' this provides some real insight into what exactly might be going on , ' @entity62 says			0
' it 's kind of bizarre because we got into it through a back door , not really starting out to look at that question			0
' in the new study , dr @entity62 and her colleagues gave newborn male mice oral doses of @entity12			2
they also exposed mice to the synthetic oestrogen ethinyl oestradiol			0
the researchers exposed the developing testis and saw that the sperm of exposed animals did a poorer job of meiosis , the process in which cells combine the genetic information of their parents			0
as a result , more sperm died			0
worrying : two years ago , a large @entity91 study warned that sperm counts are falling at an alarming rate - up to 38 per cent in a decade - with diet and lifestyle largely to blame dr @entity62 said : ' we have a window of just a few days and we permanently change the way that the testis makes sperm in the adult			1
' the study looked at three mice population : one outbred like humans and two other , very common strains that are inbred			0
researchers saw a ' very strong effect ' on outbred mice and one inbred strain and no effect on the other inbred strain			0
this would account for earlier researchers not seeing an effect on testes in earlier studies			0
dr @entity62 said : ' this mouse model would suggest that here 's actually a reason why these sperm counts would be falling			1
' we 're actually doing something to this process that 's going to cause the death of more cells as they 're trying to make sperm			2
' they 're going to get culled out by this quality - control mechanism and the upshot of that will be that if you do enough of this , you 'll drop sperm counts			1
' we 've seen effects over the course of several decades			0
what about several generations ? infertility is becoming more common			0
are we creating the perfect storm ? @entity12 is also commonly used in thermal paper in cash register receipts just yesterday , @entity34 's food safety watchdog @entity204 - the @entity204 - said @entity12 poses ' no health risk to consumers of any age , including unborn children , at current levels of exposure '			1
the chemical , which is used to stiffen some plastic food containers , poses no health risk to consumers of any age , including unborn children , at current levels of exposure , the agency said			2
some studies have suggested possible links to everything from cancer to heart disease to infertility to kidney and liver problems , prompting @entity204 ( @entity204 ) to re-evaluate the potential risks of @entity12			2
the @entity204 acknowledged in its assessment that @entity12 residues could migrate into foods and drinks and be ingested by consumers , and that @entity12 from thermal paper , cosmetics and dust could be either inhaled or absorbed through the skin			0
but it found that exposure to @entity12 was ' considerably under ' the safe level known as the ' tolerable daily intake ' , or @entity239			2
it said that after weighing up ' a significant body of new scientific information on its toxic effects ' , @entity204 's expert panel concluded that high doses of @entity12 -- hundreds of times above the @entity239 -- were likely to adversely affect the kidney and liver , and might also cause effects animals ' mammary glands			0
but at current levels -- which it said were often three to five times lower than the @entity239 of 4 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day -- it found ' no consumer health risk from bisphenol a exposure ' .			0

sex hormone oestradiol - the birth control hormone that passes untreated through sewage plants - has larger effect on sperm than @entity12
