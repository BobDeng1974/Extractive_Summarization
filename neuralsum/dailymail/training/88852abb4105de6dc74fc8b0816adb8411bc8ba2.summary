by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:27 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:02 est , 30 december 2013 a woman spoke of her shock after she gave birth to a baby daughter on @entity7 - despite no signs that she was pregnant			1
@entity9 , 29 , spent @entity10 suffering from an upset stomach and feeling bloated - but she had no idea it was because she was about to give birth			1
she went for a glass of orange juice before bed late on december 26 when a sharp pain in her stomach brought her to her knees			2
after the unexpected arrival , which took place around 11.50pm , @entity9 was taken to hospital where she and @entity24 were given the good news that little @entity26 was fit and healthy hearing her scream , terrified husband @entity24 , 33 , quickly ran to help - as @entity9 realised she was about to have a baby on the kitchen floor			1
just 10 minutes later @entity24 delivered @entity26 , a healthy 7lbs 6oz - and completely unexpected - addition to the family			1
@entity9 said yesterday : ' it ’s the biggest @entity10 surprise we ’ve ever had			1
' in the morning i had a bit of an iffy stomach and was n’t feeling too great			0
' i thought i would have some orange juice before i settled down in my bed			0
' all of a sudden i got this searing pain right through my stomach			0
@entity9 says that she had no signs of pregnancy until she went into labour ' before i knew it i was on the kitchen floor			1
' @entity24 heard me screaming in pain from the top of the stairs			1
' he came running down and basically found me on all fours on the floor			2
' i was getting this very big urge to push - i thought there ’s something not right here			0
' at that point i just screamed at him ‘ i think i ’m having a baby ’			2
' the colour just drained from his face			0
' @entity9 , from @entity59 , had no idea until that point that she was pregnant and had not experienced any of the usual symptoms over the previous nine months			1
she had even taken precautions such as getting the contraceptive injection			0
she said : ' i ’d had regular periods and i was still getting the contraceptive needle			2
' i had n’t put on any weight as such - i was still getting into my normal clothes			2
' all i had was a slight bloating - there was no movement or any indication			0
' everything just seemed normal			0
' but , having given birth to three other children -- @entity77 , 12 , @entity78 , seven , and @entity79 , 22 months - she quickly realised what was happening			2
@entity24 and son @entity77 rushed to the aid of @entity9 with towels and helped her through a difficult but speedy breech birth			1
@entity9 said : ' they did a cracking job - i ’m very proud of both of them			1
' a lot of people have said that ’s the way to do it - but it ’s nice to have the warning beforehand			0
' partner @entity24 helped @entity9 through a difficult breech birth on their kitchen floor after the unexpected arrival , which took place around 11.50pm , @entity9 was taken to hospital where she and @entity24 were given the good news that little @entity26 was fit and healthy			1
the doctors said that @entity9 had probably not felt any movement during the pregnancy due to the baby being in the breech position			1
the surprised mother and her new daughter were allowed home from @entity108 on sunday night			0
their stunned family and friends grouped together to help out with catching up on the lost months of preparation			0
they rushed out in the @entity7 sales to pick up essential items for the newborn			1
@entity9 said : ' all our family and friends have been rallying round and getting us everything			2
' it ’s been chaos for everyone but they managed to pull it off			0
' now that we are over the shock it ’s great			0
' we would n’t change it for the world but it ’s definitely not an experience we would want to ever go through again			0
