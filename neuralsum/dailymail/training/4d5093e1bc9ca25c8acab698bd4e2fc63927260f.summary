passengers travelling between @entity2 's major cities on the proposed @entity3 could pay as little as $ 50 a ticket			1
the @entity5 has confirmed that re-establishing the @entity3 will be one of its key policies for the next federal election , which means the first train from @entity10 to @entity11 could roll out by 2035			1
shadow transport minister @entity12 has told @entity13 that he is committed to spending ' $ 52 million to establish the planning authority ' for the @entity3			1
' we think it ’s a real project and that we have to act now to start planning for it			0
' it 's time to get going			0
shadow transport minister @entity12 has flagged @entity5 's intention to put the high speed rail network back on the agenda heading into the next federal election the preferred route of the @entity3 along @entity2 's east coast , taking in four capital cities and several regional locations two separate reports , one from the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) and another by @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , have provided hope it could be completed at a significant cost reduction			1
in fact , the latest study shows that construction costs have nearly halved			0
@entity28 ceo , @entity35 , said the new information highlights the need to stop debating , commit to the project and put high speed rail to the market			2
' $ 63 billion is 45 per cent less than the $ 114 billion price tag put on high speed rail two years ago , ' mr @entity35 said			1
' prices have n’t come down , instead this new $ 63 billion price tag is a reflection of current international construction costs			1
' these construction costs are why the project needs to be put out to the global market			0
' let ’s put the project out to our overseas colleagues , in @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
they have the experience , let ’s allow them to show us how to fund , construct and operate high speed rail in @entity2 , ' he said			2
@entity62 supporters say travel time by fast trains can be the equal of flying to certain destinations and in some cases they are reduced when airport screening and waiting times are factored in inside the cockpit of a high speed train			1
if authors of recent reports are right , the first trip between @entity10 and @entity11 could occur in about 15 years and tickets could be as cheap as $ 50 cost of a ticket could be as little as $ 50 between the major cities and express journey times of just over two and a half hours from @entity10 to @entity79 or @entity80			1
@entity3 supporters point out that is a similar time frame when travel to and from airports , screening and waiting times , are factored in			2
to travel the full length of the corridor , from @entity79 to @entity80 , will take about 5 hours and 56 minutes			1
mr @entity12 said his first order of business will be to establish a @entity92 ' to progress the project and begin the process of securing the corridor '			2
however , because of the high cost of bringing a @entity3 network to life , it 's likely to require a public - private partnership			1
travel times of just over 2 and a half hours between @entity10 to @entity79 and @entity10 to @entity80 he said ' high speed rail ( is ) in the box seat '			1
mr @entity12 challenged the @entity105 to recommit funding for a @entity92 and secure bi-partisan support for the project			2
' @entity110 commitment to the project is needed first , followed by the establishment of a body to oversee the project and then opening @entity2 ’s high speed rail project to the market , ' said mr @entity35			2
experts believe the ease of train travel , when compared with the often stressful nature of flight , is a principal reason why @entity62 will eventually drag more than 40 per cent of passengers away from air travel across the east coast and on the main three routes ( @entity10 - @entity79 , @entity10 - @entity11 and @entity10 - @entity80 )			1
it would also lead to a 50 per cent increase in travel between the capitals			0
the @entity129 , @entity54 's super-fast magnetic train			0
if the high speed rail network is built on @entity2 's east coast , the train is expected to top 250 kilometres per hour between capital cities the @entity3 network would comprise approximately 1,748 kilometres , with four city centre stations , four city - peripheral stations ( one in @entity80 , two in @entity10 and one in @entity79 ) and 12 regional stations			1
to enable fastest possible times between destinations and to keep up with expected demand , it would offer direct express and limited stop services			0
the @entity29 report found that by 2065 , peak period demand for @entity10 to @entity79 would be met by two non-stop inter-capital express services , every hour , in each direction			1
peak demands would supplemented by three more one - stop inter-capital express services per hour per direction , calling in at either @entity153 or @entity154			0
analysts have also assessed the viability of regional stations and come up with 12 sites			2
they are @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			2
they agree that ' fares would be structured to be comparable to and competitive with alternative modes of transport for both business and leisure purposes '			0
the plush interior of a @entity62			0
this version is the so - called @entity179 , as seen by @entity180 , a global travel and transport design consultancy			0
the @entity183 is also grappling with the benefits and costs of high speed rail			0
journey times from @entity188 to @entity189 could be cut from 48 to 26 minutes ' @entity3 fares have been set to be competitive with air fares on the main inter-capital routes on the east coast , trending downwards over time by 0.5 per cent per year to 2015 and remaining constant thereafter , consistent with the forecast reduction in real air fares			1
' it also points out that ' the proposed @entity197 can be powered by 100 % renewable energy			0
this will allow passengersthe choice of travelling with zero emissions for journeys that are appropriate to substitute with @entity3 '			0
' it is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions from regional travel would be reduced by 150 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over 40 years of operation			2
' the group was involved in this strategic study on the implementation of a @entity62 ( @entity3 ) network for the east coast of @entity2 between @entity80 , @entity10 and @entity79 - which was announced by then @entity213 , @entity12 , in 2010			1
@entity2 is not on its own currently grappling with the benefits and costs of high speed rail , plans for another high - speed rail line in @entity219 's north will go ahead even though ministers there admit they have no idea of the impost			0
the proposed route of the @entity225 in northern @entity219 will cut travel times by half in some places high speed trains can travel at speeds of up to 250 kilometres per hour as the @entity110 confirmed it would hold an official ‘ review ’ into the spiralling costs of the already controversial $ 90 billion @entity179 line , prime minister @entity234 and the @entity235 both declared their backing for @entity225			1
they claim the line – which will link @entity240 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity241 – could boost the nation ’s economy by cutting travel times between the cities by half			0
the @entity28 says @entity2 can look to countries like @entity248 as a prime example of just how an efficient @entity3 can be competitive			0
its network was established in 1992 and with 99 per cent of high speed trains there now running on time , the country brought in a money - back guarantee for passengers if their service was five minutes late			1
@entity248 authorities also recently introduced a significant price cut on tickets and increased patronage by almost 3 million passengers .			0

the @entity62 ( @entity3 ) network connecting major east coast cities will be a key plank of @entity5 policies heading into 2016 federal poll
rail fares would be cheaper than air fares , *potentially* costing passengers as little as $ 50 between @entity10 and @entity79
the estimated cost of the @entity3 has dropped from an *original* quote of $ 114 billion to almost half at $ 63 billion
@entity5 vows to re-establish @entity92 , at cost of $ 52 million
the top speed of an @entity3 train would be 250 *kph* , taking just two hours and *44* minutes from @entity10 to @entity79
four capital cities ( @entity79 , @entity11 , @entity10 , @entity80 ) and 12 regional centres , including the @entity159 , would be connected
a service between @entity10 and @entity11 could be up and running 2035
complete construction would take at least *30* years
