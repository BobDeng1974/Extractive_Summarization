by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 05:23 est , 12 april 2013 a 60,000 tonne stone structure has been discovered at the bottom of the @entity3 in @entity4			1
the giant cone - shaped cairn , which is made of basalt cobbles and boulders up to one metre long , has left archaeologists baffled as to its purpose and age			2
heavier than most modern - day warships , the structure is nearly ten meters high and 70 metres wide			1
the structure , which is more than 200 meters below the surface of the water , is made from rocks stacked on top of each other a 60,000 tonne stone structure has been discovered at the bottom of the @entity3 in @entity4 the @entity3 is the largest freshwater lake in @entity4 - it is approximately 13 miles long and eight miles wide			1
it has a total area of 64 square miles and a depth of 141 feet at its deepest point			0
it is the lowest freshwater lake on @entity28 and it is fed partly by underground springs and partly by the @entity30			0
it was first discovered in 2003 by researchers carrying out a sonar survey of the sea , but divers have now been down to investigate further and have published their findings in the @entity36 of @entity37			0
they believe that the structure , which is more than 20 meters below the surface of the water , is made from rocks stacked on top of each other which could indicate that it was design to mark a grave			1
it is thought that it was made on land and then submerged as sea levels rose			0
however , there is also a theory that it could have been created below the water as a fish nursery - similar smaller structures have been discovered in the past which were built for that purpose			2
the researchers will now carry out underwater archaeological excavations in an attempt to find associated artefacts that could tell them more about it			0
researcher dr @entity60 , of the @entity61 and @entity62 , told @entity63 that it could date back more than 4,000 years making it an @entity65 artefact			0
the giant cone - shaped cairn , which is made of basalt cobbles and boulders up to one meter long , has left archaeologists baffled as to its purpose and age ( the map shows where it was found ) he said : ‘ the most logical possibility is that it belongs to the third millennium @entity78 , because there are other megalithic phenomena [ from that time ] that are found close by			1
’ if it does prove to be from this era , then it could be connected to the city @entity84 which was one of the biggest sites in the area at the time			0
@entity89 and the miraculous catch of fish , in the @entity3 , by @entity92 many of @entity89 's sermons were preached on the shores of the lake at a time when there was a string of villages around the water 's edge			1
in the time of the @entity107 the lake 's significance in @entity89 's life made it a major destination for @entity110 pilgrims			2
its importance declined when the @entity107 lost control and the area came under the control of the @entity116			0
at this time all of the major cities in the area , other than @entity119 , were abandoned			0
in 1187 , @entity120 defeated the armies of the @entity122 at the @entity123 , largely because he was able to cut the @entity122 off from the valuable fresh water of the @entity3 dr @entity125 told @entity63 : ‘ it 's the most powerful and fortified town in this region and , as a matter of fact , in the whole of @entity4			1
’ while details about the structure remain sketchy , the researchers are confident that it was created by a well - organised society and that it ’s building was a community effort			2
sonar signatures revealed the scale of the find heavier than most modern - day warships , the structure is nearly ten meters high and 70 meters wide			1

4,000 - year - old cairn found at the bottom of the @entity3 - where @entity89 gave his sermons
structure is ten meters high , 70 meters wide and 200 metres under water
