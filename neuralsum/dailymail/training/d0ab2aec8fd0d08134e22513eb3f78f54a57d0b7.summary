they used to be the preserve of frugal maiden aunts and draughty guesthouses , but no more			2
this winter , there ’s a new breed of electric blanket on the @entity7 that is high - tech , wonderfully cosy and not in the least bit embarrassing to own			1
from ones you can wear to the one that replaces your duvet , there ’s something for everyone			1
they could even help cut your heating bills because they can safely keep you toasty all night , meaning you can turn off the central heating			1
so , with temperatures set to dip to minus 10c in parts of the @entity26 this weekend , @entity23 tested ten of the best			1
washable : yes , on a 40c wool programme			2
you have to stretch it back to its original size when damp			2
verdict : the electric blankets of old were strictly for bedtime , but now you can get smaller blankets like this heated throw to keep you snuggly on the sofa or at your desk			1
for people like me — married to a skinflint who turns the heating on only for high days and holidays — this is revolutionary			1
i work from home , which usually means dressing for the @entity54			2
but within minutes of putting this electric throw on my lap , i ’m taking off my body warmer and fingerless gloves			1
@entity59 five , the hottest setting ( approximately 36c ) is too cosy — i ’m in danger of falling asleep at the keyboard			2
the more ambient level one ( about 21c ) is perfect			2
the lead is 13ft long and it turns itself off after three hours			2
4/5 best for @entity67 lovers @entity69 heated double duvet , £ 99.95 , dreamlanduk.co.uk cost : just 1p to heat all night long			1
@entity70 heated cotton duvet washable : machine washable and you can tumble dry it , too			1
verdict : a heated duvet is my idea of heaven and my husband @entity80 idea of hell			1
he does n’t even like a hot water bottle , but i ’m hoping he wo n’t notice we ’re ‘ plugged in ’ because this looks and feels just like a normal cotton duvet ( you can use it all year round with or without the power on )			1
you put your duvet cover over this as normal — the electricity lead pokes through the fastening at the bottom of the cover			1
then you plug it in ( at 16ft , the lead is longer than the length of a bed )			2
there are two control panels — one for each side of the bed			2
it took five minutes to heat up , by which time my make - up was off and i was in my nightie			1
if @entity108 complained , i did n’t hear him because i was fast asleep			2
i thought it was wonderful			0
4½/5 best for marital harmony @entity112 , @entity113 , £ 99.95 , @entity114 cost : less than 2p for 8 hours			0
washable : machine washable at 30c and can be tumble dried			0
verdict : romance often goes out the window in the winter			0
instead , it ’s all about survival as we begin the nightly battle of the bedclothes			1
well , marital relations may now improve thanks to this dual - controlled heated under - blanket			1
this goes over the mattress followed by your usual bottom sheet			0
it took the longest to heat up at around eight minutes , but we both liked the fact there are body and feet zones on both sides that can be adjusted independently using the nine heat settings between 45c and 70c			0
the electric blankets of old were real energy - guzzlers , but this is cheap to run			1
5/5 best for single beds single washable fleece heated mattress cover , £ 59.99 ( on sale at £ 32.99 ) morphyrichards.co.uk cost : less than 2p a night			0
@entity146 washable fleece heated mattress cover washable : 40c wool cycle			0
tumble dry on low heat			0
verdict : my eldest daughter ’s attic room is perishingly cold			1
but i was n’t sure an electric blanket would be safe because , when i was growing up , you had to make sure it was switched off before you went to sleep			1
i need n’t have worried			0
the new generation of wonder warmers cut out automatically if the electrics get too hot			1
this model , which goes under the bottom sheet , is recommended for children aged from eight years and you can keep it on all night at a low temperature — it goes from 20c to 60c — and takes barely five minutes to warm up			0
my daughter has never been happier to go to bed			0
but i could n’t rouse her the next morning			0
for teenagers who feel the cold , keep it as a weekend treat or you ’ll never get them out of bed			0
4/5 electric blankets could help cut your heating bills because they can safely keep you toasty all night , meaning you can turn off the central heating , says @entity177 @entity178 @entity179 by @entity180 , £ 54.99 , stressnomore.co.uk cost : 1p for three hours			1
washable : yes , on a 30c cycle , but only up to five times			0
verdict : in the winter , i like to sit up in bed reading while @entity108 mindlessly watches reality tv or sport downstairs			0
now , i can ditch the jumper and dressing gown and drape this heated cape around me			0
made of a fluffy , breathable microfibre , it ’s soft against the skin and takes a few minutes to heat up			1
it fastens with three press - studs down the front and you can fasten the sides if you want to create sleeves			1
the heat radiates from the back section and you soon forget you ’re wearing it			0
when @entity108 comes to bed , he bursts out laughing and says i look like a spinster			0
it ’s not sexy , but i ’m too cosy to care			1
there are three heat settings ( maximum 60c ) and it switches off automatically after three hours to ensure it does n’t overheat — just do n’t forget you ’re connected to the mains when you stand up			0
3½/5 best for @entity215 @entity216 , £ 24.99 , stressnomore.co.uk beurer heating pad cost : 1p for three hours			1
washable : no. verdict : my dad moans that there are three in his bed during winter : him , my mum — and my mum ’s freezing feet			1
if it ’s only your tootsies that feel the chill , slip this heated pad into the bottom of the bed , and your feet will warm up in no time without the hassle of hot water bottles or bed socks			1
the controller is pretty basic with a clunking switch , but the 12in - by - 16.6in pad heats up very quickly and there are three settings from 55c to 75c			1
the only downside is if you put the pad at the foot of the bed , you ca n’t reach the controller because of its short lead , although it ’s designed to turn off after 90 minutes			1
the pad is also ideal for relieving arthritis , neck or back tension — and even period pain			0
3/5 @entity252 harmony luxury heated overblanket from @entity255 , £ 80 for a double , littlewoods.com cost : 1p to 2p a night			0
washable : machine washable on a wool cycle and can be tumbled dried			0
verdict : i ’m more of a duvet girl , but for traditionalists who like a top blanket , why not turn up the heat with this electric number ? it ’s super soft and very economical			1
it comes with dual controls , which cut out those nightly arguments about temperature settings			2
there are five settings from 21c to 36c as well as a fast - heat setting — not that it ’s really needed because the blanket warms up in under five minutes			1
the downside was @entity108 managed to kick the blanket off in the night because it ’s lighter than a duvet , so i ended up cold again			1
3/5 best for aches and pains @entity280 , £ 99.99 , argos.co.uk cost : 2.8p for eight hours on the lowest setting			0
washable : only the removable cover			0
verdict : imagine sinking into a warm bed that moulds to your body and you ’ll get a good idea what this topper feels like to sleep on			0
silentnight heated fleece memory foam topper the fleecy cover makes it ultra cosy and the ‘ give ’ in the memory foam means the body is supported , making it brilliant for those with painful joints who struggle to get comfortable in a normal bed			0
it comes with dual controls so that couples can choose their own temperature settings			0
there are also two separate heat zones on each side of the topper — one for the body and one for the feet			0
i cranked the foot zone up to the max , but preferred a lower heat for the rest of my body			0
the timer allows you to keep the blanket on from one hour to all night , and because both sides can be on different timer settings , it really is bespoke			2
sadly , it does n’t come in superking size , or i might invest			0
4/5 best for super-sized beds sleeping beauty superking fleecy blanket , £ 72 , @entity328 cost : 3p to 5p per night			2
washable : yes at 40c and tumble dryer safe , too			0
verdict : if you have a superking bed , it ’s hard to find an electric blanket big enough			1
most brands go up to only a kingsize , but the @entity327 range at @entity337 has this fleecy under - blanket , which goes over the mattress and you put your sheets on top			1
it ’s actually pretty good value when you see how big it is , and you ca n’t feel the wires			2
it also has dual controls so there ’s no arguing over the right temperature			2
even when it ’s not turned on , it adds an extra soft layer to the mattress			2
i thought it was very comfy			0
@entity108 said it was like lying on a dead sheep			0
