by @entity0 one of @entity2 's most well - known jihadists continued to receive welfare payments from the @entity4 months after he had fled the country to join other @entity8 extremists in the @entity9			1
@entity10 , who fled @entity2 in december on his brother 's passport to link up with fundamentalist militia group @entity13 in @entity15 , was receiving a disability support pension at least two months after he left , according to @entity17			1
it is understood by the newspaper the convicted terrorist 's $ 766 - a - fortnight payments continued even after it was known by officials he was bound for the @entity9 , but it can not be confirmed that he was able to access the money			1
in 2008 , he became a convicted terrorist when he pleaded guilty and was jailed for acts in preparation for a terrorist act after he was one of eight people arrested for plotting to attack the @entity43 nuclear reactor - in @entity45 's south			1
when asked by the @entity2 to confirm its findings , human services minister @entity46 declined to comment due to privacy reasons			0
currently , authorities do not have the power to scrap welfare if an @entity2 is thought to be engaging in terrorist activities but a disability pension can be stopped once a person is not in the country for six weeks			1
an earlier picture on @entity10 's @entity58 page of a young child brandishing a gun with the caption : ' one of dawlas youngest members ' this new information comes to light after @entity10 issued a call - to - arms for other @entity2 @entity67 to join @entity13 's bloody war in the @entity9 as well as posting a photo on @entity58 of a young child brandishing a rifle			1
in the early hours of july 5 , @entity10 tweeted : ' come and be part of what we have dreamt ... for decades '			1
it was accompanied by a picture of him decked out in army camouflage posing with a gun in front of a white @entity80			0
this followed his fellow brother - in - arms @entity82 , one of almost 60 @entity2 fighting for extremist groups in the @entity9 , took aim at diggers fighting in @entity86 , tweeting : ' look at the end of these @entity86 maliki dogs bunch of girls ca n't wait to see a @entity2 soldier cyring [ sic ] saying bakia			1
' the @entity91 reported that ' bakia ' meant ' he cries ' in @entity93 and ' maliki ' was a term used to describes the @entity96 government , which is led by @entity97			0
the regime is strongly opposed to @entity100 extremists who have torn through @entity86 's north in the past few weeks			0
another tweet fired off from @entity10 read : ' my ( provisions ) are beneath the shade of my sword			0
we live better than we lived in our country			0
' but these uploads barely scratch the surface of the disturbing content found on @entity10 's @entity58 page			2
earlier posts contain pictures so graphic that @entity115 has chosen not to describe or publish them			0
but one that can be shared is of a young child brandishing a gun and smiling with the caption : ' one of dawlas [ sic ] youngest members ' - which was posted late may			0
@entity125 is arabic for country or state			0
other photos show @entity10 standing in front of military vehicles as well as fundamentalist propaganda memes			0
he told people to ' come and be part of what we have dreamt for for decades ' and said : ' we live better than we lived in our country ' @entity10 ( pictured ) is part of @entity8 extremist group @entity13 - a breakaway group of @entity35 these tweets came just days after the @entity2 government said almost 60 @entity2 fight for @entity8 radicals in @entity86 and @entity15			1
meanwhile about 150 @entity2 were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations , recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight			2
this information was revealed after @entity45 teenager @entity146 , 17 , became the third @entity2 teenager to walk out on his family in june bound for @entity86 to fight in the troubled war zone			1
he went missing from his family 's @entity151 home - in @entity45 - almost three weeks ago , and has only been heard from once when he contacted his mother to say he was in @entity154			0
ten @entity2 have died while fighting for extremists in @entity15 and @entity86			2
the latest is a 22 - year - old @entity45 man , @entity156 , who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group @entity13 - formerly known as the ' @entity159 ' and ' @entity159 ' - shortly before he was ambushed in @entity15			2
in one of the recruitment videos entitled there is no life without @entity164 , an @entity2 man who calls himself @entity166 said he wanted to send ' a message ... from a @entity67 brother 's heart to another brother 's heart '			2
he appeals to @entity2 @entity67 to come join him in the @entity9 to restore ' honour ' in the region , saying : ' @entity174 , wake up and be part of this effort			0
' the former @entity45 resident fled from @entity2 in december - believed to be going to @entity15 - on his brother 's passport an @entity159 recruitment video titled there is no life without @entity164 showed five extremists , including this @entity2 on the left , urging people to ' respond to @entity186 ' and ' wake up and be part of the effort '			1
