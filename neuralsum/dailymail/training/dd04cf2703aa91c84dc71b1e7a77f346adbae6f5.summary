by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:23 est , 1 february 2014 controversy : @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 members furiously debated a 7.7 per cent rise in the price of tea at the @entity11 from 65p to 70p with large parts of @entity18 under water , the @entity13 in chaos and the economy barely out of recession , you might think mps had better things to do than worry about a 5p rise in the cost of a cuppa in the @entity26			1
but politicians staged a heated debate on the issue at @entity30 last week , and voted by narrow majority to increase the price from 65p to 70p			1
the taxpayer - subsidised cost is still less than half the price of a cup in @entity36 opposite @entity37 , where tea is at least £ 1.65			1
the debate took place behind closed doors at a meeting of the @entity43 , which is in charge of catering at @entity30			0
tribal party allegiances were put to one side as @entity5 @entity47 , @entity7 ’s @entity48 and @entity6 @entity49 vigorously opposed the 7.7 per cent hike			1
one source said : ‘ they said the price of a cup of tea is high enough and there is no reason why mps – or staff – should pay any more			1
’ but @entity7 ’s @entity60 said @entity58 could not impose budget cuts on ordinary voters and then refuse to do likewise in the @entity26			2
the 5p increase would save taxpayers £ 10,000 a year , officials said			2
the rise , to come in from april across most commons cafes , was decided by a majority of five to four			0
the committee chairman , @entity5 mp sir @entity69 , did not vote while @entity71 , chairman of the backbench @entity72 , decided to abstain			2
commons bosses have already introduced price rises across the network of @entity30 cafes and restaurants to bring them closer to high street prices			0
savings : the boosted price of the popular beverage will save about £ 25,000 of taxpayers ' money a year change : despite a bid to move closer to high street costs , it remains less than half the price of @entity36 tea debate : mps were told they could not impose budget cuts to ordinary voters and then refuse to do likewise a series of other increases were approved , including 5p for a banana , taking it to 35p , 5p on a bag of chips ( 85p ) and 5p on a cup of latte coffee ( £ 1.70 )			1
all the measures together will save about £ 25,000 a year			0
one mp who did not take part in the debate said : ‘ mps do n’t earn as much as people think and i do n’t think 65p is particularly cheap			0
' our secretaries earn even less			0
the way things are going , we will soon have to pay the kind of prices you get in five - star hotel			0
’ but mr @entity60 defended the increase , saying : ‘ we have to make an effort to reduce the taxpayer subsidy on catering			2

majority of five voted in *favour* of increase from 65p to 70p for tea
@entity5 , @entity7 and @entity6 members *expressed* outrage at 7.7 *%* hike
