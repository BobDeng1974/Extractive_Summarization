@entity0 officially starts this week and households up and down the country will no doubt been thinking about giving their homes a good dusting , de-cluttering and getting rid of any lingering winter blues			2
but this year , why not go a step further and give your finances a spring clean ? it really could slash hundreds of pounds off your annual household expenditure and help you save more for the luxury items such as holidays and clothes			2
here , @entity15 , financial journalist and founder of blog @entity18 , reveals her top tips to help you cut the cost of living and become savvy savers			1
parenting charity @entity38 holds regular nearly - new sales offering clothes at knock - down prices - such as baby grows from as little as 50p for not one , but five			1
toys - often in very good condition - cost as little as £ 2 and children 's dvd are on offer from just £ 1			1
and it 's not just baby bargains savvy shoppers will find - there is a great selection for children too			1
there 's little point buying all - new clothes for little ones as they grow out of them so quickly			1
the @entity38 has strict quality guidelines for sellers , plus buyers can inspect the items before purchasing			2
for those who are good at haggling , you 'll walk away with more bang for your buck			2
check the @entity38 for details of locations and dates of these sales			0
they are held nationwide and throughout the year			0
2 ) de-clutter and sell unwanted goods now is the time to go through your cupboards and get rid of anything you no longer need or use			1
to make a few extra pennies that could go towards pocket money for the kids , or spending money for your family holiday , why not consider selling these items ? at @entity38 sales , table hire is around £ 20 , but , if you have plenty of decent things on offer , you could walk away with hundreds of pounds			1
you can sell furniture - so for mothers with items like cots and even wardrobes , it 's the perfect marketplace			1
do n’t worry about having to fit everything into your car			0
instead , take pictures of any bulky goods to place on a noticeboard on the day			1
you ’ll be surprised at just how popular these are			0
for non-child - related goods , try a boot sale			1
they start up in spring and run until october , with an entrance fee to pay			0
just be prepared to get up early to bag a space ! check out @entity112 for locations and dates			0
car - boots sales are a great way to have a clear - out of unwanted goods and also pick up a little extra cash 3 ) buy school uniforms from the supermarket school uniforms are expensive – but there are ways to cut costs			1
the first tip is to avoid buying items such as plain shirts , dresses and bottoms from uniform shops where the prices are significantly higher			0
for example , a plain polo shirt from a niche shop may set you back about £ 5 each , but a pack of two from the supermarket costs as little as £ 2.50 – that ’s just £ 1.25 each			0
you could put the savings towards other expenses , such as school trips			0
some school uniform items do have to be purchased via a uniform shop because a certain logo or style must be adhered to			0
if this is the case , and if you 're looking to save some pennies , see if you can get them second - hand			1
many schools will sell once - worn clothes , but you may have to ask			1
you could also ask other parents if they are willing to sell anything that their child has outgrown			1
4 ) use cashback sites these are n't anything new , but if you 're not already using a cashback site , it 's the perfect way to easily save some money and earn rewards			1
they work by giving shoppers a percentage of their purchase total every time you shop online via a specific cashback site			1
simply register for free , then click through to your chosen retailer , such as @entity176 or @entity177 , and then shop as normal			0
the purchase is tracked and the cashback site will give you back some money ; rates can vary from as little as 1 per cent to as much as 10 per cent			1
some stores also offer you a cash lump sum			0
and it 's not just limited to retailers , you can also earn cashback for utilities ( broadband , tv , phone ) , insurance and even days out			1
new @entity196 customers , for example , could get £ 151.50 cashback for tv and broadband packages via @entity199 , £ 30 cashback for using @entity200 via @entity201 and 2 per cent back on @entity203 purchases using @entity204			1
you really could end up with hundreds of pounds back into your pocket - but only ever use reputable cashback sites			1
5 ) use @entity208 vouchers to pay for days out if you ’re collecting @entity208 points , then use your vouchers to pay for days out using @entity211			0
it ’s tempting to stick them in your purse and pay for everyday groceries when you go shopping , but they are worth a lot more if you use @entity211 – you could exchange them for up to four times the face value			0
use @entity208 vouchers to pay for days out instead - these can be exchanged for cinema tickets a £ 4.50 voucher is worth just £ 4.50 if you use it to pay for groceries , but if you boost it online , that will get you a day pass to a @entity227 where a child ticket otherwise costs around £ 20 – that ’s a saving of more than 75 per cent			2
you could also use your vouchers to exchange them for cinema tickets or eating out			0
take a look at @entity208 to see the deals			0
6 ) plan your meals for a family , food is a huge weekly cost			1
but it is also an area where you can easily save some money			2
as well as shopping smart and buying own - brand products where possible , the next thing to do is to plan your meals			1
devise three or four and rotate them every week to ensure there is variety			0
but , this way , you wo n't get tempted by expensive treats while wandering around the supermarket - and it will ensure all food is used ; rather than wasted or thrown away			2
always go shopping with a list - and stick to it			2
better still , do your shop online – that way you can avoid all those ' buy one get one free ' or ' half price ' deals , not to mention it will probably reduce stress and give you more quality time with your children			0
7 ) there ’s still time to make use of childcare vouchers childcare costs are rising faster than the rate of inflation			0
recent research from the @entity269 showed a 33 per cent increase in the past five years , and a report last week from single parent charity , @entity273 , found half of single parents have had to borrow money from friends , family or banks to pay for childcare in the last two years			1
with costs so high , it ’s important to make use of all the financial help you can get			0
if you are working and are not making use of childcare vouchers , then you should – you could save as much £ 933 a year , per parent , towards the costs of childminders , nurseries , play groups and after school care or clubs			0
childcare vouchers are essentially salary sacrifice schemes and you make savings through tax			0
it is offered by employers , so talk to your hr department about it			0
the system is , however , changing in @entity304 2015 , with a new tax - free childcare scheme being introduced , after which you will not be able to apply for childcare vouchers , but existing users will be able to continue using them if they want			2
some parents will be better - off with the existing childcare voucher scheme , as the new system will not help you if you have children over the age of 12 for instance – so , it is a good idea to apply for childcare vouchers now and then choose what is better for you in the @entity304 when the new scheme kicks in			2
some parents may also be able to get tax credits , but childcare vouchers can affect the amount of tax credits you get , so check the @entity324 calculator to find out whether you would be better - off			2
