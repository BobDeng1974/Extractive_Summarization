a swarm of mutant rats that are immune to poison is ' closing in ' on a @entity6 town , pest exterminators have warned			1
the rodents , which have been seen elsewhere in the @entity8 over the past year , are twice as large as normal species and can not be killed with traditional substances			1
it comes after the discovery of one rodent at a food establishment measuring 20 - inches , the largest on record for the town of @entity17			2
pest exterminators have warned an influx of super rats may be on its way , with the rodents immune to traditional poisons ' it 's a growing problem , and at the moment there 's no sign it 'll go away , ' said @entity30 who found the rat in @entity17 , told @entity33			1
' unless you can extinguish all of the genetic line the rise of super rats is on the horizon			2
' at longer than 20 - inches , it is the largest to have ever been found in @entity17			2
though the rat was killed using traditional anti-coagulant poison , mr @entity30 warned others that are immune to the substance will become ' a greater problem			1
' one particular strain of rats were not so susceptible to rodenticides or the anti-coagulants served and , as a percentage of the total rat population , they become greater over time			2
' as far as resistance is concerned , it is a growing issue and over a period of time i expect this to be a greater problem than it currently is , but establishing a time - frame is harder			0
' the implication is if you are a rat and you 're not being taken on , you might enjoy a longer life and grow to a larger size , because you are not being taken down			0
' if there 's a good source of food and water it becomes a larger rat			0
' another of huge rodent is the width of a shovel			0
the rat was discovered near a river in @entity77 , @entity78 , last april @entity79 provided by @entity80 , found here this mutant rat was found hiding in the walls of a home in @entity85			2
experts have warned the breed of giant rodent is on the rise this rat discovered in @entity91 last year measured 50cm			1
unless the entire genetic line is killed , the population of super rats will continue to increase a map details where notable rats have been recorded across the @entity8 since 2010			1
the rat discovered in @entity17 this week was giant at 20 - inches , but not considered ' mutant ' as it was killed traditionally mr @entity30 added while he had not found any mutant rats in @entity17 , their population will continue to grow across the @entity8			1
' most counties have shown there are some strains of genetically different rats however it 's whether they have a particular control problem that 's the issue			0
' we have n't had any major control issues but companies like ours need to adapt new strategies for new rodents			0
' @entity115 rats are typically larger than sewer rats and can not be killed by traditional rodenticides			1
the species has developed a genetic mutation which means substances approved by the @entity121 to control rat populations has no effect on them			1
pest controllers are calling for new rules to be made allowing the creation of stronger poisons , though the health and safety risk to humans and the environment this bears is a bone of contention			0
most rats are found in food premises , though some have been recorded across the @entity8 in homes			1
to prevent the creatures from infesting your home or business , experts advise keeping conditions spotlessly clean			0
ensuring wheelie bins have proper drain holes is also important , said exterminators			0
' a rat in the wrong place is a problem for anybody so you have to be vigilant whether its commercial or residential			0
' they 'll chew water pipes , electric cables and it puts your property at risk , ' said @entity30 of exterminators , @entity160			0
earlier this year a number of abnormally large rats were recorded across the @entity8			1
worried homeowners shared photographs of the rodents , some of which were as large as small cats			2
one , found on an industrial estate in @entity170 , measured two feet , while another in @entity77 , @entity78 , was the width of a shovel			0
researchers at @entity174 performed studies on the rodents , with some parts of @entity8 more severely affected than others			1
in @entity180 and @entity181 , around 20 per cent of rats tested were immune to traditional poisons , while a third in @entity183 could not be killed using the substances			1
in @entity186 , 75 per cent of the rodents were found to have the genetic mutation			1
speaking at the time , scientist dr @entity188 described the giant species as ' a time bomb '			0
' i think people should be concerned about these resistant rats because of public health concerns - because they carry disease and various other bacteria and viruses			2
' they also damage buildings â€¦ they cost billions of pounds of damage worldwide			0
' with the use of rodenticides , that will kill off the normal rats , and then the resistant ones will remain			2
' so it 's a sort of time bomb of resistance building up over generations of rats			0
' ' the fact we 've tested 17 counties and every single one of them has got resistant rats was an amazing find to us			1
we did n't expect to have every single county having resistant rats			0
' an exterminator holds up a giant rat discovered last year alongside a host of other huge rodents a @entity221 carries a giant rat it killed while on a walk in @entity225 , @entity78 , last year			1

the huge rat was discovered in @entity17 , @entity6 , by exterminators
comes after scientists tested giant rodents that were immune to poison
' @entity115 rats ' have been recorded in different populations across the @entity8
genetic mutation makes them large and resistant to traditional poison
