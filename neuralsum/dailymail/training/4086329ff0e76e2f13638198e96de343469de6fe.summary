@entity0 has revealed that a glowing recommendation from one of world rugby 's outstanding coaches played its part in @entity7 - born @entity6 making an unlikely journey from @entity9 to potential @entity11 star			1
@entity6 , 23 , is among four uncapped players in @entity11 head coach @entity0 's 34 - man squad for this season 's @entity14			1
despite making just nine appearances as a @entity18 player , the former @entity19 and @entity21 fly - half will report for @entity11 duty next week , joining forces with fellow number 10s @entity24 and @entity26			2
the chief 's @entity6 has received a surprise call - up to the @entity30 squad @entity6 , who had a spell with @entity18 , was given a glowing recommendation by @entity33 friday , 6 february : @entity34 ( @entity35 ) sunday , 15 february : @entity36 ( @entity37 ) saturday , 28 february : @entity38 ( @entity39 ) saturday , 14 march : @entity40 ( @entity35 ) saturday , 21 march : @entity41 ( @entity42 ) @entity6 , whose mother was born in @entity11 , offers @entity0 options at fly - half and full - back			1
and the @entity11 boss says a conversation he had with @entity33 , who worked with @entity6 at the @entity21 and will rejoin @entity7 's coaching staff this year after helping to mastermind their @entity51 triumph , provided an invaluable guide			1
' i had a good chat to @entity33 about him , and @entity33 could n't speak more highly , ' @entity0 said			2
' he thought he was very coachable , he wanted to learn			0
' they were very impressed by him at the @entity21 , both as a player and as a person			0
' when that recommendation comes from someone like @entity33 , you 've got to take notice of that			0
' i met with @entity6 here ( in @entity11 ) with his dad a bit longer than 12 months ago			2
we sat down and had a chat			0
@entity0 has allowed @entity6 the option of returning to @entity7 to hold out for the @entity7 ' with his mother being born in @entity35 , we knew that he was an option for @entity11 , and the discussion was a very general one			1
' there was no pressure from us in terms of his declaration , and if he wanted to go back to @entity7 , play @entity9 and continue the dreams and aspirations to be in the @entity7 , i did n't have a problem with that			0
' he went back and had another season with the @entity21 , and i think @entity6 then thought that for him to fulfil his dream of playing international rugby , the best opportunity for him was to come to the @entity18 and make himself for @entity11 in the short term , and hopefully the long term			1
' he has the ability to play at 10 and 15 , and goalkick as well			0
we really want to have a good look at him in this window and see how he goes			0
' forwards : @entity92 ( @entity18 ) , @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , @entity95 ( @entity96 ) , @entity97 ( @entity98 ) , @entity99 ( @entity96 ) , @entity100 ( @entity18 ) , @entity101 ( @entity102 ) , @entity103 ( @entity18 ) , @entity104 ( @entity98 ) , @entity105 ( @entity98 ) , @entity106 ( @entity96 ) , @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , @entity111 ( @entity98 ) , @entity112 ( @entity98 ) , @entity113 ( @entity18 , capt ) , @entity114 ( @entity98 ) , @entity115 ( @entity116 )			1
backs : @entity118 ( @entity110 ) , @entity119 ( @entity98 ) , @entity120 ( @entity96 ) , @entity24 ( @entity98 ) , @entity26 ( @entity96 ) , @entity6 ( @entity18 ) , @entity122 ( @entity18 ) , @entity123 ( @entity110 ) , @entity124 ( @entity125 ) , @entity126 ( @entity96 ) , @entity127 ( @entity116 ) , @entity128 ( @entity116 ) , @entity129 ( @entity18 ) , @entity131 ( @entity130 ) , @entity132 ( @entity96 ) , @entity133 ( @entity121 )			1
@entity6 , who helped @entity7 win the @entity134 earlier in his career , is joined in the squad by fellow @entity11 rookies in @entity116 centre @entity127 , @entity96 prop @entity95 and @entity18 hooker @entity103			1
there are no places , though , for 95 times - capped @entity18 prop @entity141 or @entity102 fly - half @entity143			0
@entity143 's omission is not a surprise - he was left out of @entity0 's autumn test squad earlier this season - yet 33 - year - old @entity105 had been tipped for a recall after @entity96 forward @entity148 suffered a shoulder injury			2
@entity6 , @entity127 ( above ) , @entity95 and @entity103 are among four rookies to be called up but @entity0 has chosen @entity99 , @entity97 and @entity100 as his three tighthead props , raising fresh question marks over @entity105 ' international future			1
' it was a long debate about leaving @entity141 out because we know he has been working hard , ' @entity0 added			0
' we know his experience , and if we do get injuries we can call him in			0
it is about us developing some strength in depth in that position that we do n't have a huge amount of			0
' with @entity141 at the moment we do n't see him as a player who comes off the bench , we see him as a starter in that position if he does come into the squad			0
' @entity99 is currently sidelined with a neck problem , although every indication is that he will be fit for @entity11 ' high - octane @entity30 opener against @entity34 in @entity35 on february 6			2
@entity102 star @entity143 ( right ) did not make it into @entity0 's squad elsewhere in the squad , there is a recall for fit - again @entity96 scrum - half @entity120 , who joins fellow number nines @entity119 and @entity118 , with @entity127 featuring among the centres			1
@entity127 , who is among seven players to have so far signed a national dual contract in @entity11 , has also been named in the @entity11 under - 20 squad for their @entity30 campaign , and he will be released from the senior camp to link up with the age group side			1
@entity11 will also face @entity34 in their @entity51 pool later this year , while the @entity30 campaign also features away games against @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity41 , plus a @entity191 appointment with @entity40 .			2

@entity6 was surprise selection in @entity11 2015 @entity30 squad
@entity0 revealed a conversation with @entity197 coach @entity33 *convinced* him to pick the former @entity18 no 10
@entity127 , @entity103 and @entity95 are the squad 's other rookies
