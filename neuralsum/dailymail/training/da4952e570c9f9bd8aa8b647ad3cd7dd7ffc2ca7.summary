by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity2 wants to take this competition ‘ very seriously ’ , but for 45 minutes it looked as if no - one had told his players			1
then , after eight minutes of the second half , up popped @entity8			2
it was a decent time to score his first goal in more than 100 @entity13 games ; a decent time to remind @entity2 of what he can offer , considering he has less than a year on his contract and @entity17 are deliberating over a move			1
until then , @entity13 had been dire against			1
thereafter , they cantered , @entity19 rounding off the win in stoppage time			1
heading home : @entity8 gets up the highest to score the first goal in a poor @entity25 clash dire : @entity26 carries the ball past @entity28 in a game that neither side looked eager to win @entity31 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity32 6.5 ; @entity33 6 , @entity34 6 , @entity35 6 , @entity26 6 ; @entity36 5.5 ( @entity37 63 , 6 ) , @entity38 6 ( @entity39 76 ) , @entity40 ; @entity41 5 ( @entity42 63 , 6 ) , @entity43 6 , @entity44 6			1
subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49			2
booked : @entity26 manager : @entity51 5.5 @entity13 : @entity52 6 ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 5.5 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 7 , @entity58 6 ( @entity59 46 , 7 ) , @entity60 6.5 ; @entity19 7.5 , long 5.5 ( @entity61 90 ) , @entity62 6.5 ( @entity63 29 , 7 )			1
subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68			2
manager : @entity2 6 referee : @entity71 6.5 att : 6,014 @entity72 : @entity63 @entity2 said : ‘ there were two different halves			2
after the first 45 , i was unhappy with the team			0
they played fantastically , but we were very sloppy , not aggressive , not pressing			0
but much better in the second half			2
‘ the result is ok but i wo n’t forget the first 45			0
they ( @entity31 ) gave everything and we did n’t in the first 45			0
’ credit to @entity31 , they battled			0
credit to @entity31 , they were deceptive , considering all signs suggested this was a tie they could do without			0
@entity51 made nine changes to the side that lost to @entity90 in the @entity91 on saturday , and in the stands , there were 4,000 less than at the weekend			0
@entity2 , by contrasted , only drafted @entity94 , @entity62 and @entity95 into the team that drew with @entity97			0
@entity2 added : ‘ we know we ca n’t win the @entity99 so we will see what we can win			0
for others , maybe they ca n’t always go with the best team because there are so many games , but we do n’t have @entity106 football			0
’ @entity62 , used on the left on @entity13 ’s attack , is one of the latest bright talents to come through the club ’s academy and looks likely to get more senior chances this season			1
at 21 , he has already been included in the @entity115 squad and made his league debut for @entity13 against @entity117 on the opening day			1
celebration : @entity59 wheels away in delight after netting his first goal for @entity13 at the den here , he offered a single glimpse of what the fuss is about by rapidly pursuing @entity33 and closing a 10 - yard gap before scrapping for possession			1
but that was the extent of it			0
@entity133 through the first half he went down injured and after 29 minutes he came off			2
if that was worrying for @entity13 , then so was the composition of the first half			1
they controlled large periods without creating chances , while @entity31 twice came close			0
first , @entity40 delivered a corner from the right which @entity34 glanced across goal			2
then , from @entity32 ’s punt , @entity41 raced clear after 35 minutes			0
he sliced his shot horribly			0
@entity19 attempted a lob from 40 yards for @entity13 in response , but it was easily saved			1
it summed up the visitors ’ half			2
ecstacy : @entity19 was clearly delighted with his late goal , which was thoroughly deserved @entity51 said : ' i feel absolutely gutted			1
i really enjoyed the first half			2
when i saw their team sheet i thought what have i done ? i wanted to give people a chance , but i knew it was a risk			0
i am delighted with the way they did it but i am devastated			0
' the second started no better , @entity164 going close after receiving a pass from @entity34 on the left			0
he cut inside and shot marginally wide from the edge of the area			0
@entity63 , on for @entity62 , came close moments later as @entity13 finally tested @entity32 , his shot from 20 yards drawing a good save			1
@entity63 was again involved as @entity13 broke through in the 53rd minute			1
his pass created a chance for @entity19 , whose shot was tipped over			1
and then @entity63 took the resultant corner , from which @entity8 headed the opener			0
the 10 - minute blitz was completed by @entity19 hitting the post			1
thereafter , @entity19 went close again with a drive from the edge of the box and then had a low strike well saved by @entity32 , while @entity31 had a shout for a penalty rejected			1
@entity19 deserved a goal and he got one , striking in stoppage time			1

@entity59 scores first goal for the club to put @entity13 ahead
@entity19 *doubles* the *advantage* in final moments
saints *dominant* in second half after a poor first - half *display*
