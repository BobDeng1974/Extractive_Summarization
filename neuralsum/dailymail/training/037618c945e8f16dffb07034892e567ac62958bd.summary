@entity40 had been a rising star of the @entity62 , close to prime minister @entity63 , a favoured visitor at @entity64 , a war hero and the dashing husband of actress @entity67 , one of the great beauties of her day			0
but @entity2 , whose other lovers have included @entity71 actor @entity70 , legendary womaniser @entity72 and @entity74 star @entity73 , says the @entity75 was far more interested in painting it as a sex scandal and chose to ignore claims of a widespread spying network			1
quoted in the @entity80 , @entity2 says : ' i know the truth and it is far more shocking than what the public has been fed by the @entity75			2
@entity86 was a game - spying was a serious business			0
' far better that the @entity75 be caught with its pants down than involved in stealing secrets			0
