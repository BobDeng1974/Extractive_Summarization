@entity1 vice-captain @entity0 believes the @entity3 team will be plagued by doubts when they contest the 40th @entity5 at @entity6			1
@entity3 captain @entity7 has made it clear that he feels this year 's contest offers those players on the wrong end of the ' miracle at @entity13 ' the chance of redemption			1
but @entity0 thinks the manner of that defeat in @entity18 , when @entity1 fought back from 10 - 4 down on saturday afternoon and from 10 - 6 behind in the final day singles , will have a negative effect			1
@entity0 believes the miracle of @entity13 would be playing on his mind if he was in the @entity3 team ' if it was me i do n't think that would spur me on , ' @entity0 said			1
' i would think that would put a lot of doubts in my head , the fact that you 're four points clear at home and you lose			0
' i do n't know how that would spur you on , it 's almost more deflatory			2
' @entity1 have won seven of the last nine contests and not lost on home soil since 1993 , but @entity0 does not subscribe to the theory that the @entity3 need a win to maintain interest in the biennial contest			1
' not in my book , ' the 2002 winning captain said			0
' if they never win again i 'll still be very interested			0
they want it just as much as we want it			0
that 's a point that you really must get over			0
the @entity1 team celebrate having won the @entity5 in 2012 after a superb comeback @entity55 came from 10 - 6 down in the final day singles to claim the trophy ' they love the @entity5 like all @entity1			1
they really want to win it back just as much as we want to retain it and that 's what makes it such a fantastic sporting event			0
' seven of the 12 - man team from @entity13 - @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 - have also made the side for @entity6 , while wild card @entity76 has his own score to settle having lost the decisive singles match to @entity80 in 2010			2
' i made it very clear to them that this trip is a redemption trip , ' @entity7 said			2
@entity7 has made it clear that he feels this year 's contest offers the chance of redemption for the @entity3 ' those players that played on that team , it 's time to make amends and try to redeem yourselves from what happened in 2012			1
i think it 's a motivation rather than a negative			0
' the @entity3 team arrived together on a flight from @entity101 on monday morning , while members of the @entity1 team made their own way to @entity6			2
both sides were due to have their first official practice sessions on the course on tuesday			0
