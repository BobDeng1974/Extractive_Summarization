' the beds - in - sheds phenomenon means there is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are four times as many as we first suspected , ' said @entity51 , the @entity52 leader of @entity15 council			1
' the pressures of migration in @entity16 , fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from eastern @entity58 , are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just have n't had to contend with before			2
' what was once thought , even just 18 months ago , to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs			0

but we get complaints from their neighbours that we can not ignore , and it is not fair on them that these houses should turn into cash cows for opportunist landlords			0

the outbuilding constituted a breach of planning because it had no planning consent to be constructed , especially as it was equipped for stand - alone living - i.e. kitchen , lavatory , bedroom etc. ' in november @entity155 served a planning enforcement notice with two elements			2
' one required the beds in sheds outbuilding to be demolished while the other part required the main building to be returned to a family dwelling			0
