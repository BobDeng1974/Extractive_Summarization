by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 02:42 est , 17 july 2012 @entity1 has attempted to shift attention away from the controversy over when he truly left @entity4 by accusing @entity5 of favouring political donors with government contracts in a form of cronyism that ‘ stinks to high heaven ’			1
appearing on @entity13 , the presumptive @entity12 presidential nominee said : ‘ this is a tough time for the people of @entity16			0
but if you ’re a campaign contractor to @entity5 , your business may stand to get millions or hundreds of millions in cash from the government			2
' in a conference call with reporters , @entity1 advisers said they were gathering examples of mr @entity5 's ‘ @entity26 - style politics ’ to prove to voters there was an insidious ‘ pattern ’ of contracts being awarded to donors			1
crony capitalism ? president @entity5 has been accused of giving government contracts to campaign donors under fire : @entity1 has found himself under attack for his record at private equity firm @entity4 the @entity1 campaign also released a new internet ad using a clip of mr @entity5 singing @entity41 's @entity42 to insinuate suggest ties between donors and the @entity5 administration			1
it was also a retort to an @entity5 television commercial featuring mr @entity1 's off - key rendition of @entity49			2
@entity50 , a senior @entity1 aide , said : ‘ there are countless examples of this over the past three and a half years , whether it ’s the @entity55 or the stimulus bill , or the @entity57 and the @entity59 bill , and over the course of the next few days we 're going to be highlighting some of these examples of how the @entity5 economy works			2
’ the @entity1 campaign has highlighted @entity64 , a @entity66 solar energy company that went bankrupt , and @entity67 , a venture capital firm whose affiliated companies have received federal loans and grants			2
@entity71 , the company 's founder , is a major @entity5 campaign fundraiser			0
but the @entity1 campaign said it would not release details of its campaign ‘ bundlers ’ , as mr @entity5 has done			1
the decision provides further ammunition to @entity79 , who have accused mr @entity1 of a lack of transparency			0
mr @entity1 has said he will not release any tax returns beyond those for 2010 , which have already been made public , and 2011 , which are still being finalised , despite pressure from @entity79 and some @entity12 to do so			1
accusations : the @entity1 campaign is keen to highlight mr @entity5 's support of failed company @entity64 protest : democrats and campaigners are pushing mr @entity1 to release more details of his tax returns mr @entity50 told @entity95 , a conservative talk radio host , that the @entity5 focus on @entity4 was designed to distract from the president ’s poor economic record			1
‘ what we ’re seeing here is what @entity5 warned about in 2008 in his acceptance speech in @entity104 , when he said , you know , when you do n’t have anything to run on , you try to make big elections about small things			0
’ pressed on the issue of tax returns , mr @entity50 said that mr @entity1 was n’t budging			1
‘ he ’s releasing 2010 and 2011 and we ’re happy to talk about those			0
‘ but the fact is what we really want to talk about are the @entity1 plans for creating jobs in our economy , for turning this economy around , getting it moving again , stopping the excessive regulation , the mandates and the onslaught of taxes and debt			0
that ’s what the @entity16 people want to talk about and the constant effort to hold up shiny objects and distractions – we ’re going to keep focused on what the voters care about and what matters to them			0
‘ it ’s not @entity1 ’s tax returns			1
it ’s their tax returns and are they able to have income to file a tax return ? do they have a job ? we have over half a million people – fewer @entity16 working today than when @entity5 took office			1
’ swing state campaign : mr @entity5 travelled on @entity145 to an airport near @entity147 , @entity148 mr @entity1 has found himself on the defensive over federal documents filed by @entity4 that conflicted with his statements about when he left @entity4			2
in a filing with the @entity153 in february 2001 , @entity4 listed mr @entity1 as the company 's ‘ sole shareholder , sole director , chief executive officer and president ’			0
it said mr @entity1 's ‘ principal occupation ’ was as @entity4 's managing director			0
mr @entity1 's campaign , backed up by a number of independent fact checkers , has repeatedly said mr @entity1 had almost nothing to do with the company 's operations after february 1999 , when he began work on the imperilled 2002 @entity168			0
the significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when @entity172 oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy			0
it is also when mr @entity1 stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in @entity4			0
mr @entity1 has said that neither senator @entity178 , the 2008 @entity12 nominee , nor senator @entity180 , the 2004 @entity79 nominee , released more than a years ' worth of tax returns as candidates			1
but the @entity5 campaign has been successful in making mr @entity1 ’s estimated wealth of at least $ 250million a key focus of the campaign , for the time being at least			2
mr @entity1 also faces difficulties explaining his secrecy over his tax returns because his father governor @entity192 of @entity193 released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968 .			1
