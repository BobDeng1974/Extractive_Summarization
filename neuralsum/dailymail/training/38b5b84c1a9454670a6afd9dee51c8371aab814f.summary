the families of two babies given to the wrong mothers by an ‘ alcoholic ’ nurse two decades ago have been awarded almost £ 1.5million in damages			1
the newborn girls were placed in the same incubator at a @entity8 clinic just before the blunder			1
a paternity test uncovered the truth ten years ago , but the girls have stayed with their non- biological parents			1
a court in the southern town of @entity16 today ordered the clinic in @entity18 to pay the compensation to the two families including to @entity21 and her daughter @entity22 , pictured one of the mothers , @entity24 , said : ‘ i do n’t see my biological daughter any more			1
' the social , educational and cultural differences between the two families added to the pain of our unconscious rivalry , took their toll on our relations			0
’ in a joint civil action , the families had demanded £ 10million from the maternity clinic , the doctors who supervised the two births , and the auxiliary nurse			1
but a court in @entity16 , southern @entity8 , yesterday awarded the smaller sum , with £ 300,000 to be given to each of the girls			1
three of the parents will get £ 220,000 each , while the girls ’ three siblings will each receive £ 50,000			2
the clinic in @entity18 had admitted fault but blamed the accidental swap on a trainee nurse , who it said suffered from alcoholism			1
yesterday a clinic spokesman noted the ‘ significant difference ’ between the amount requested and the sum won			0
one of the lawyers for the families said they would not be appealing , and added that they were ‘ relieved that the court had recognised the clinic was responsible ’			1
the mistake came about after mrs @entity21 gave birth on july 4 , 1994 , to a daughter , whom she called @entity22			0
the baby was suffering from jaundice , so a day later she was placed in an incubator next to another girl , named @entity68 , who also had jaundice			0
mrs @entity21 discovered that @entity22 was not her biological daughter despite the fact she had raised doubts with hospital staff the condition causes the skin to become yellow , and the girls were treated using light from special lamps in the incubator			2
however , when they were returned to the wrong mothers , mrs @entity21 said her daughter ’s skin seemed to be much darker than before			1
staff at the clinic dismissed her concerns , telling her that the difference was due to the incubator lamps			2
the girls were taken home by the unwitting parents and grew up 20 miles apart			2
but @entity91 , now 20 , said that as a child she was frequently teased in her village near @entity18 about being the ‘ postman ’s daughter ’ because she did not resemble her father			2
he finally took a paternity test when @entity22 was ten			1
it then emerged that not only was he not the biological father but mrs @entity21 was not her biological mother			0
further inquiries revealed the clinic mix - up			0
the two families met but are now estranged			0
the second family was also at court yesterday but has chosen to remain anonymous throughout the legal proceedings			0
@entity91 has previously said : ‘ they [ the clinic ] took my innocence away			0
they took away my dreams , my hopes , my desire to have children			0
’ both sets of parents had originally pressed criminal charges against the clinic			0
but because the swap had taken place more than a decade earlier , the case was dismissed under the statue of limitations			0
@entity24 , pictured shortly after giving birth at the age of 18 , discovered her daughter had been accidentally switched at birth ten years after the event the @entity130 in @entity18 , @entity8 , where the mix - up occurred in july 1994 , after the two newborn girls were placed in the same incubator to help treat jaundice			1
