by @entity0 more than 100 pigs have been blown up in @entity2 over a three - year period for research into battlefield injuries , it was revealed today			2
some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in @entity12 , @entity13			1
animal rights groups say the exercises are ‘ impossible to justify medically , ethically or educationally ’ , but the @entity16 insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in warfare			1
some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010 , 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012 - and animal welfare group @entity41 ( @entity41 ) has urged the military to stop the practice now			1
the group said that more than 80 per cent of @entity2 ’s allies in the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) - including 20 @entity48 member states - no longer train military medical personnel using animals			1
a spokesman told @entity52 : ‘ to shoot , stab or blow up live pigs in order to train our military medics makes as much sense as conducting modern warfare with muskets			0
‘ vastly superior non-animal trauma training methods , including life - like human - patient simulators , are available and used by the militaries of 23 of the @entity2 's 27 @entity46 allies			1
‘ it 's time for the military to end its participation in these inhumane and ill - conceived exercises for the sake of both our fighting forces and animals			2
’ animal cruelty ? military surgeons who serve in the @entity73 taking part in controversial medical training @entity76 away : some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010 , 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012 , figures have revealed the 2010 pigs were blown up to see if they could be saved after suffering ‘ severe battlefield trauma ’ , while the 2011 pigs were being tested for the effectiveness of blood clotting products			1
tests on those killed in 2012 were for finding out more about both methods , reported the @entity34 's @entity86			2
' to shoot , stab or blow up live pigs in order to train our military medics makes as much sense as conducting modern warfare with muskets ' @entity41 spokesman but the @entity16 believes the practice is vital for safe and effective treatments and pre-treatments for biological and chemical agents , and developing methods that have saved lives in @entity101			1
the exercises are also said to have developed a safe treatment for botulism for the armed forces – which has also been used in civilian cases of the infection in @entity2 and abroad			0
a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ the research we undertake saves lives			0
it develops world class protective equipment for our troops as well as advances in medical treatment that have benefited those injured on the battlefield as well as civilians			0
‘ countering the threat posed by chemical and biological weapons and improving the treatment of casualties on the battlefield can not currently be achieved without the use of animals			0
row : @entity41 said that more than 80 per cent of @entity2 's allies in the @entity46 - including 20 @entity48 member states - no longer train military medical personnel using animals research : some pigs were even put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in @entity12 , @entity13 ( pictured ) ‘ we are increasingly using computer modelling and cell cultures to reduce the need for testing on animals			1
we are committed to increasing this and developing further alternatives			0
’ ' countering the threat posed by chemical and biological weapons and improving the treatment of casualties on the battlefield can not currently be achieved without the use of animals ' @entity16 spokesman the @entity16 has killed 28,000 animals in various tests over the last three years , and the use of animals in military experiments in @entity2 is legal			1
@entity41 obtained photographs last month of pigs being shot with an @entity156 assault rifle or a 9mm handgun in experiments attended by surgeons serving in @entity2 ’s @entity160 in @entity26			2
during these experiments , sedatives are first mixed into the pigs ’ food			0
when they fall asleep they are anaesthetised by a vet			0
the animals are then taken to a shooting range , where marksmen try to ensure that their shots injure but do not kill			0
the pigs are then placed on a stretcher – just as a human casualty would be – while medics use dressings to stem blood loss before a waiting team of surgeons operates .			0

115 pigs killed in 3 years to test if they could be saved after being injured
some put in body armour before being blown up at @entity13 military base
@entity33 figures show 21 pigs were blown up in 2010 , 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012
@entity41 : exercises can not be justified ' medically , ethically or educationally '
@entity16 insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in war
