by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 15:57 est , 11 july 2012 the mysterious vandals who have been stealing @entity3 flags from the tombstones of @entity6 soldiers have been caught			1
but the unlikely culprits are much different from ordinary cemetery vandals			2
by setting up surveillance cameras throughout the historic @entity11 , @entity13 cemetery , police found that none other than woodchucks – the rodents that help predict the weather every february in @entity18 – were responsible for the grave ’s defacing			1
mayor @entity47 told the @entity48 earlier this week that it is a relief to discover who – or what - was behind the defacing			0
he said that the miniature flags are coated with a substance that the woodchucks find enticing , and found out that other towns were having the same problem with rodents taking flags			2
in total , 75 flags were reported missing , shocking locals who could n’t believe someone would want to deface the graves of those killed in the line of duty			1
in one night alone , 17 flags disappeared from the soldiers ’ graves			1
authorities set up surveillance cameras to catch the culprits in the act			1
they were surprised to see that the groundhogs living within the cemetery were to blame			0
‘ i ’m glad we do n’t have someone who has taken it upon themselves to desecrate the stones and the flags in front of them , ’ mayor @entity47 said			2
the mayor added that scraps of the flags were found in the woodchuck ’s burrows			2
cemetery caretaker @entity90 , who helped police in the search , told @entity94 ’s @entity93 : ‘ we were startled to find a woodchuck at the base of the tombstone with an empty flag pole in front of him			0
’ sleuthing : a concerned citizen holds ruined flags while a @entity11 police officer looks on ; in total , 75 @entity3 flags disappeared patriotism : people first noticed the flags were disappearing preceding @entity110 celebrations the caretaker said that the evidence had always been against human vandals , pointing out that the flags were pulled downward rather than being ripped out			1
the flag thefts were discovered in the days leading up to @entity110			0
as flags were put around the graves , they would again disappear , baffling and angering those involved			1
but police did not rule out a more sinister explanation			0
police chief @entity122 told @entity123 that he had never seen anything like this in his 27 years of service , adding : ‘ typically , the assumption is juveniles or kids partying might be responsible for this type of incident			0
’ it is unclear what @entity43 or the town plans to do with the cemetery ’s living residents , though it is clear that chief @entity122 said there was n’t much of a choice fighting the pests			0
‘ i ’m not sure how you can go up against @entity142 , i think you ’ll have to start plugging up the holes , ’ he suggested			0
historic : the @entity42 section of @entity43 houses many @entity6 soldiers			1

up to 75 @entity3 flags went missing from graves of @entity6 soldiers in days preceding july 4 celebrations
police placed surveillance camera to catch the culprits
