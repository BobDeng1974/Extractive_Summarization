by @entity0 published : 03:48 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 21:30 est , 22 january 2013 more than 5,000 soldiers are being axed in a fresh round of defence cuts – despite @entity4 wading deeper into the battle against terrorists in @entity7			1
former commanders said the controversial cuts were ‘ too deep ’ , leaving the @entity10 perilously overstretched and unable to take on all the major military commitments demanded by ministers			2
under the latest round of redundancies , the @entity10 will shrink to 90,000 – its lowest level since before the @entity16 began 200 years ago			1
some troops currently risking life and limb on the front line in @entity22 face the axe next year , the government admitted			1
defence secretary @entity24 , pictured meeting troops in @entity26 , will announce the third round of job losses ministers revealed the bleak news just hours after prince @entity31 returned from flying attack helicopters against the @entity33 in @entity34			1
the announcement also came after @entity36 said @entity4 would be at the forefront of a ‘ generational struggle ’ to confront and destroy @entity40 - linked extremists in @entity7			1
while he has ruled out sending combat troops , he is preparing to deploy @entity43 spy planes and special forces in the wake of the insurgency in @entity47 and the @entity49 terror attack			0
but critics raised concerns about the wisdom of continuing to slash the @entity53 when the battle against @entity56 fanatics was shifting to @entity7			0
colonel @entity57 , who commanded @entity4 forces in @entity22 , said : ‘ these cuts are too deep			1
on monday the @entity60 said we had a decades - long struggle with international terrorism , as illustrated by recent events in @entity49 and in @entity47			0
mr @entity24 said medics in the @entity66 and @entity67 would be cut in the next round of job losses ‘ this struggle can not be maintained without sufficient resources			1
' the @entity60 and his successors will continue to commit @entity4 troops to defend the nation ’s interests overseas , irrespective of how small the forces gets			1
‘ of course our troops will rise to the challenge but in doing so they will pay a price in overstretched and inadequate equipment			0
‘ the cost of our fight against world jihad has to be paid by somebody and it should be the taxpayer – the soldier should not be called upon to bear an unequal burden			0
’ this government has been responsible for some of the most severe defence cuts ever			2
under the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) , the @entity92 said it would cut the @entity10 from 102,000 to 82,000 – small enough for every soldier to fit inside @entity95			0
some 5,000 personnel each from the @entity97 and @entity66 have already been made redundant			0
the government wants to replace regular troops by doubling the number of part - time soldiers to 30,000			0
shadow defence secretary @entity102 called for the ‘ flawed ’ defence review to be reopened because it had been ‘ exposed by world events ’			1
he said : ‘ the threats have increased and yet the @entity10 is being cut			0
the prime minister rightly spoke of the urgency of the @entity110 terror threat to the @entity4 from @entity7			2
captain @entity111 as he is known in the @entity10 , races out from the @entity114 ( very high ready - ness ) tent to scramble his @entity116 with fellow pilots , during his 12 hour shift at the @entity4 controlled flight - line in @entity26 southern @entity22 @entity36 was challenged in the @entity120 yesterday by former @entity122 leader sir @entity121 over the impact of cuts on @entity4 's ability to mount military operations around the world ' but in a “ carry on regardless ” strategy , the @entity92 has announced 5,000 @entity10 redundancies			1
‘ there are real worries about the military impact of a loss of skills and capability at a time of increased threats and new global challenges			0
@entity139 will fear ministers are unprepared for threats we face			0
’ defence minister @entity143 insisted the @entity53 retained the capabilities required ‘ to meet the challenges of the future ’			2
redundancies would not ‘ impact adversely ’ on operations in @entity22 , he said			1
defence secretary @entity24 added : ' the @entity10 is actively managing recruitment to reach the target numbers , but unfortunately redundancies are unavoidable due to the size of the defence deficit that this government inherited and the consequent scale of downsizing required in the @entity10			1
’ ministers are taking the axe to the @entity53 to save £ 4.7billion from the defence budget and plug a £ 38billion equipment overspend			2
the latest round of redundancies affects junior soldiers to senior ranks			2
personnel preparing for , serving on , or recovering from operations on june 18 – the day redundancy notices will be issued – or recuperating from a serious injury will be exempt unless they volunteer			2
but ministers warned that the @entity10 will feel one more bout of pain , with as many as 4,000 troops made redundant next year , as well as @entity66 and @entity97 medics			0
the prospect of more sackings will be a blow to morale for troops who are seeing their pay , pensions and living allowances squeezed .			0
