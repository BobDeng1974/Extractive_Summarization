the asian giant hornet grows up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting which injects a large amount of potent venom			0
the hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans and has been compared to a hot nail being hammered into the body , the head of the hornet is orange and quite wide in comparison to other hornet species			1
the asian giant hornet is intensely predatory ; it hunts medium - to large - sized insects , such as bees , other hornet species , and mantises			1

groups of @entity112 hornets hover in front of a beehive , picking off single honeybees , decapitating them and stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the ' meat ball ' to feed their young			1
it is a further problem for the @entity121 honeybee , which is struggling to cope with changes in farming and climate and already has one @entity132 invader to contend with - the varroa mite , which feeds on the bees and makes their hives more vulnerable to disease .			1
