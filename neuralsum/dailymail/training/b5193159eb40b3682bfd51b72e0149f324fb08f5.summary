by @entity1 correspondent with nine months of pregnancy behind them and the prospect of endless sleepless nights ahead , it is little wonder that new mothers do n’t feel at their most attractive			2
new fathers , however , have no such qualms			0
in fact they think they are more handsome than before			0
the scientists who made the discovery said that having physical proof of virility may give the male ego a boost			1
new fathers , such as @entity20 's @entity19 , believe they are more handsome than before - perhaps because physical proof of virility gives the male ego a boost and reinforces masculinity the @entity25 researchers quizzed almost 200 couples about how attractive they felt on a scale ranging from ‘ very ugly ’ to ‘ perfectly beautiful ’ or ‘ ultimately handsome ’			1
the men and women rated themselves just after their wedding and then again close to their first and second anniversaries			0
forty eight of the 182 couples had a baby during this two - year period			1
the women who did n’t have a child felt more attractive over time			1
however , the others felt less appealing after their baby was born , the @entity39 reports			0
in contrast , becoming a father appeared to boost a man ’s opinion of himself			0
@entity47 researcher @entity46 said new mothers may still be struggling to cope with the physical changes to their body			0
dr @entity46 , a social psychologist , said : ‘ first - time mothers report surprise at the extent to which their bodies have changed and how long it takes to “ get their bodies back ” which can lead to women feeling frumpy			1
the researchers found that first - time mothers reported surprise at the extent to which their bodies had changed , which led to them feeling frumpy ‘ women are aware that their bodies are scrutinised even in pregnancy and they seem to become more self - critical regarding their appearance as a result of the pregnancy			1
’ fathers , however , may benefit from feeling they have proved their masculinity			0
the researcher said : ‘ there are strong connections between virility , fertility and masculinity for men			2
‘ men who are diagnosed as infertile report feeling their masculinity threatened			0
‘ so , for men , having a child may serve to enhance feelings of masculinity , resulting in men feeling more attractive			1
‘ the fact that the women were negatively affected and the men were positively affected by the birth of a child is consistent with other research that suggests that men are less likely than women to experience the “ costs ” of having children			1
‘ indeed , research suggests that husbands place more importance on having children and are more likely to say they want children than women			2
’ she added that new fathers should n’t feel too smug , as their belief they are more attractive soon fades			2
she also said that as her data came from marriages in the 1990s , more research is needed to check the same is true today .			0

@entity25 researchers quizzed couples about how attractive they felt on a scale ranging from ‘ very ugly ’ to ‘ perfectly beautiful ’ or ‘ ultimately handsome ’
while women felt ' uglier ' after having a child , male self - esteem was boosted
physical proof of virility was cited as one reason for their raised egos
