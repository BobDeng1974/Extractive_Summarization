what do you call a sheep with two faces ? that 's the conundrum a @entity6 farming family has contended with since they discovered one of their ewes had given birth to a baby lamb with the unique deformity last friday			1
' i 've tried to think of a name for it but it 's so unique that nothing really fits , ' said farmer @entity19 , from @entity20 , near @entity21 at the southernmost point of @entity24 's @entity23			1
one @entity26 radio station suggested they call it @entity28			1
but the family appears to have settled on a name thought up by ms @entity19 's little girls , @entity32 , 10 , and @entity33 , 8 , and @entity34 , 6			1
two of everything ! the family of @entity19 and @entity37 , who live near @entity21 at the southernmost point of @entity24 , have taken to calling the lamb ' @entity40 '			1
adored : @entity41 , 10 , @entity42 , 8 and @entity43 , 6 , have taken a liking to the little lamb			0
' my wee girls just called it @entity40 , ' ms @entity19 told @entity49			2
with four eyes , two noses and two mouths , @entity40 is a little different from the rest of the flock			0
but after the initial surprise of discovering the little lamb with ' two of everything ' , @entity40 has fast become one of the family 's favourite farm animals			1
' we really care for him like one of our own now , ' ms @entity19 said			2
rugged up ! ms @entity19 said : ' we really care for ( @entity40 ) like one of our own			2
' cuddles ! the children with @entity40 , the lamb with ' two of everything '			0
two @entity40 's deformities have only caused him a few issues			0
he tilts slightly to the left when he walks and has some difficult feeding			0
but ms @entity19 said @entity40 appears to be a happy lamb who interacts with the other farm animals like normal			2
' he 's just a bit of a dude , ' she said			0
farmers often encounter deformed lambs , but it 's rare for them to live this long			0
' we do know - and the kids know - it 's not going to live forever , ' ms @entity19 told @entity49			1
' but for it to live this long is a bit of a miracle really			0
