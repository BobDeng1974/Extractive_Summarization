the @entity15 had a penalty anyway and when they kicked to the corner hooker @entity30 was on the end of the lineout drive			2
@entity34 converted before @entity35 pulled @entity18 to within one point with two penalties but @entity3 peppered the home side with long kicks to keep them pinned in their half			2
a strong and quick defence saw @entity18 stuck , save for a clever lineout move that saw @entity43 , back from the thumb injury that kept him out of @entity26 ’s opening autumn international defeat , charge up to the chief ’s 22 , but his chip was smothered by white shirts			0
the suffocating @entity3 defence got its reward when @entity1 intercepted @entity17 ’s pass on halfway , and despite @entity55 catching him five metres short the big number eight slid over for a try converted by @entity34			2
@entity57 of @entity18 is tackled by @entity1 of @entity15 @entity17 of @entity18 receives medical treatment during the @entity9 clash @entity2 thought they had their opening try when @entity61 ghosted out of ruck on his 10 metre line to sprint clear			1

@entity55 ’s offload went to ground and @entity17 knocked on trying to pick it up with the line in sight			0
@entity3 thought they had a third try just before the break but the @entity75 ruled there was no obvious grounding by @entity78			2
but it mattered not as @entity80 picked up from the ensuing five metre scrum to charge over for his second try			0
@entity34 converted to give @entity3 a commanding lead at the break			0
a @entity87 ceremony was held before the game at @entity89 the visitors could have killed the game off straight after the interval when flanker @entity14 broke through from a lineout on @entity18 ’ 10 - metre line , but a penalty ended the attack			0
@entity3 players punched the air when they saw off a lineout drive minutes later and with 26 minutes to go @entity34 added a penalty to make it 24 - 6			1
but the pressure was building and @entity18 finally got their first try thanks to the pace and great hands of @entity105 as he passed inside to send @entity107			0
from five metres in from the touch , @entity35 made it 24 - 13 with 20 minutes left			1
ten minutes later and relentless pressure saw @entity57 wriggle over in the left corner , but @entity35 missed the touchline conversion to leave @entity2 six points behind			0
