nervous about flying ? there 's an app for that			1
a new app , called ' am i going down ? ' , calculates a plane 's chances of crashing in an effort to put apprehensive passengers at ease			0
created by @entity13 - based @entity12 , the app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety			1
a new app , called ' am i going down ? ' , shows just how unlikely it is that your plane will crash if you 're flying on a @entity23 777 @entity22 flight from @entity24 to @entity25 , there 's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your flight will go down en route			1
and even the most avid flyers have little to fear			0
according to the app , if you take a flight every day for the next 11,146 years , you are unlikely to experience even one incident			1
developer @entity33 spoke to @entity34 about the app , explaining that it 's meant to calm the fears of those who are uneasy when it comes to air travel			1
developed by @entity13 - based @entity33 , the app was initially created to allay the fears of nervous flyers ' the original inspiration for @entity45 ? comes from my wife ( and co-founder of @entity12 ) , @entity49 , ' he wrote in an email			1
' her fear of flying has always made travelling difficult , so i wanted to make an app that demonstrates - after entering airline , aircraft and flight details - that flying is in fact extremely safe			1
' as a typical example , flying on a @entity58 747 - 400 from @entity13 to @entity59 has a one in nine million chance of crashing ... not quite as long odds as winning the @entity63 , but not far off			0
' more than 10 million routes have been assessed , using data from such sources as the @entity67 , the @entity68 and the @entity69			0
' for my analysis , i only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality - which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying , ' @entity33 explained to @entity76			2
' i then incorporate the volume of flights , weighted to the most recent , to provide the final " one in a million " statistics			0
' users can select their plane , their destination and their departure information for a personalised analysis mr @entity33 has not included @entity85 on the list of airlines , in sensitivity to the recent tragedy the release of the app , however , did come at a rather awkward time - just days after @entity85 flight @entity92 went down			1
' admittedly , the timing of the release was unfortunate			0
i originally developed the app in february 2014 , shortly before the first @entity100 crash , ' he told @entity34			2
' that crash caused me to rethink , so i put the app on hold to work on a few other things			2
' i sent the final app to @entity106 for review in december , just two weeks before the @entity92 crash			2
' in response to the tragedy , @entity33 has temporarily removed @entity85 from the airline list , explaining that it will return in a later update			2
' despite all that , the reaction has been extremely positive so far - especially from those with a fear of flying , ' he added			0
the ' am i going down ? ' app is now available on @entity118 and is currently only available for @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			0
an @entity123 version may be released in the future .			0

' am i going @entity127 ? ' app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety
created by @entity33 to help allay fears of nervous flyers , like his wife
even if you take a flight every day for 11,146 years , unlikely to ever crash
