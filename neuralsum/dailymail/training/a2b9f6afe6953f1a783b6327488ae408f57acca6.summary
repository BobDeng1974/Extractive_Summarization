ms @entity9 , 47 , told the @entity31 : ' it 's unforgiveable			2
it was there in black and white that another boy of @entity1 's age had accused @entity10 of grooming him and then sexually assaulting him			2
' all it needed was for the police to run his name through the system and they would have noticed the pattern			0
' but no one picked up on it and now my son is dead			0
i felt like dying when i found out			0
i still feel like dying now			0
' until now , @entity1 's family thought @entity10 ' alleged crimes had been missed by @entity16 because they were recorded in @entity22 , but the new information suggests this was not true			1
that is because the allegations , which the @entity53 decided against pressing charges over , were logged on to the systems which can be accessed by any police force			0

' they went on the @entity12 in september 2011 after the allegations were first made , then ­ added to the @entity13 in march 2013			0
