by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 19:15 est , 23 november 2013 a plan to pay £ 1,000 ‘ bonuses ’ to @entity3 has been branded ‘ policing on the cheap ’ and a cut - price way to fill the gap created by the loss of 10,000 full - time officers			2
at present @entity3 - volunteers often with other jobs - only receive expenses			1
the @entity11 hopes that by allowing local forces to make the bonus payments it will help them recruit more specials			1
dispute : the chairman of the @entity19 working group said the plan could be an attempt to fill gaps which should be taken by regular officers but @entity24 , chairman of the @entity19 working group , said : ‘ our fear is this could be policing on the cheap , trying to fill gaps which should be taken by regular officers			1
’ in some areas , specials , along with civilian @entity28 , already make up the majority of key town centre patrols on busy friday and saturday nights			2
they are trained and have the power of arrest but are less experienced than regular officers , and may have work commitments that mean they have to cancel shifts at short notice			1
mr @entity24 added : ‘ when you start to rely on a group of people who have day jobs , you could have a scenario where no one turns up			2
it ’s nothing to do with them as individuals or their training – it ’s just they have a job outside the force			0
’ @entity53 , crime tsar for @entity54 , believes the bonus plan would transform policing , especially in rural areas			1
replacements ? the plan comes ahead of a report which will warn that cuts are threatening the survival of the traditional beat bobby he said : ‘ specials are the only realistic way to bring the village bobby back as a familiar trusted face , stopping the police from being a remote bureaucracy for many rural people			0
’ but @entity71 , secretary of the @entity73 chief officers , said : ‘ specials are members of the public keeping their neighbourhoods safe			0
if you start paying people , will you get a different person coming forward ? ’ the plan comes as a major report due to be published tomorrow warns that cuts are threatening the survival of the traditional beat bobby			0
the study , commissioned by @entity84 and produced by former met commissioner @entity85 of @entity86 , will say that 10,000 frontline officer posts have been lost as a result of a 20 per cent cut in force budgets since the 2010 election			0
it will also say that police are only now reacting to crimes rather than preventing them , as ‘ bobbies on the beat are disappearing ’ .			0
