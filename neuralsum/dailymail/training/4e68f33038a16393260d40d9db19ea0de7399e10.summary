african - american civil rights groups plan to protest outside sunday 's @entity2 show , where every single one of this year 's 20 acting nominees is white			1
however small , the demonstration will revive debate about diversity at the @entity2 - awarding @entity8 , whose voting members are overwhelmingly white and with an average age in their 60s			1
' the goal of the protest is to send a message to the @entity8 , send a message to @entity18 , send a message to the film industry , ' said @entity21 , head of the @entity22			1
' and the message is very simple : you do n't reflect @entity25 , your industry does n't reflect @entity25			0
women , hispanics , african - americans , people of color ( are ) invisible in @entity18			0
' civil rights groups are planning protests outside sunday 's oscars about @entity18 's lack of diversity			1
@entity39 director @entity38 and star @entity40 were among those overlooked when the 2015 nominations were announced last month notable snubs this year include @entity44 's @entity40 who was widely tipped to receive a nomination for playing @entity46 in @entity39 @entity47 and @entity48 were famously lauded as having made a breakthrough for winning best actress and actor @entity2 in 2002 , but while there has been some progress in the decade since , it remains too little			1
critics rounded on the @entity8 as soon as the nominations were announced last month , with all - white acting categories for the first time in nearly two decades : the last time was in 2011 , and before that , 1998			1
notable snubs included @entity44 's @entity40 , widely tipped for playing @entity46 in @entity39			1
the film 's director @entity38 , was also left out , although the movie is among eight best picture nominees			2
the @entity8 has defended itself			2
its first @entity68 president , @entity67 , said shortly after nominations were unveiled that they spurred her to accelerate reforms to make the @entity8 more inclusive			2
' personally , i would love to see and look forward to ( seeing ) a greater cultural diversity among all our nominees in all of our categories , ' she said at the time			0
but @entity76 , head of the @entity78 center for african american studies , and author of ' the @entity81 ' , said the @entity8 is heading in the wrong direction			2
@entity47 and @entity48 were famously lauded as having made a breakthrough for winning best actress and actor @entity2 in 2002 , but 2015 has seen all 20 acting nominations go to white actors @entity76 , who plans to release an update on his diversity report in a couple of weeks , said that 93 percent of the @entity8 's members are white , about 70 percent male , while the average age is 63			1
' in many ways the @entity8 is falling further and further behind because @entity25 is more diverse , ' he said			2
' in about two or three decades , we are going to be majority minority ( with minorities making up most of @entity25 population ) and you are going to have an @entity8 with 90 something percent white ? that makes no sense			1
' @entity103 , a member of the @entity8 since 1978 and former @entity105 executive who produced @entity106 ( 1983 ) , acknowledged that the body has some work to do			2
' there should be more diversity within the @entity8 itself , ' he told @entity111			0
' they are trying to do something about it			0
we have an @entity68 president			0
she is doing all she can to increase the membership diversity			0
' @entity118 , president of the @entity119 , said : ' this is unjust , to see the lack of @entity68 in the presentation			0
so we 're mad ! we 're upset ! ' he stressed that there are ' so many ' actors from various ethnics and racial groups			0
' but the process eliminates them , ' @entity128 said			0
' there is an invisible ceiling over their heads , that the @entity8 has put there			0
we 're calling for them to tear down that invisible ceiling			0
' sunday 's diversity protest is planned for 2:00 pm ( 2200 gmt ) , only minutes before @entity18 's finest begin taking to the red carpet for the pre-show fashion parade , and barely three hours before curtain up on the 2015 @entity2			1
nominees for this year 's @entity2 : sunday 's diversity protest is planned for barely three hours before curtain up on the 2015 ceremony			1

notable snubs included @entity44 's @entity40 who had been widely tipped to receive a nomination for playing @entity46 in @entity39
voting members of the @entity2 - awarding @entity8 are overwhelmingly white and with an average age in their 60s
