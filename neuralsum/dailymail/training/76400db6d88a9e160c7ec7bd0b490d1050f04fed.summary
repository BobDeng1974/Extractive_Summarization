the next year , he asked ms @entity8 to type up his memoirs - which he had , poignantly , wanted to call @entity39			1
he wrote his note of thanks on september 18 , 1944 - but on september 19 , he went missing over @entity18 , and his body was later found and buried by locals in the @entity45 town of @entity46			1
@entity2 's death was not officially announced until nearly four months later			1

it reads : ' my dear miss @entity8			2
i am enclosing a little gift in the form of a gold @entity6 brooch in deep appreciation of the work you put in on my book			1
' it was very nice of you to spare all the time and i 'm glad to say the book is now getting passed for censorship			0
' when it does get published i shall make another little gift to you so that you can buy something for yourself			0
' but in the meantime all the best and thanks very much			0
' ms @entity8 kept the letter from @entity2 - as well as the reply she sent which he never received - for the rest of her life , before leaving the notes and brooch to a friend when she died in 2000			1
the items were sold at auction in @entity88 , @entity89 this week - and although the estimate was set at £ 300 , they ended up going for a total of £ 11,200 including auctioneer 's fees			1
@entity94 , of @entity95 and @entity96 , said : ' i suppose the gift and letter was a last chivalrous act performed by @entity2			1
they are very poignant items considering what happened to him the following day			2
' any items connected with @entity2 or the @entity3 are extremely rare and are hardly ever seen on the open market			2
the men were held in such high regard in @entity108 and abroad			0
' we had seven telephone bidders , but they dropped out at £ 3,000 and it was left to two men in the room			0
' the under - bidder told me afterwards that he had to drop out - as how could he explain to his wife that he had spent £ 11,000 on a letter ? ' collection : the brooch and letter are displayed alongside ms @entity8 's reply , which was never delivered , and a copy of @entity2 's memoirs entitled @entity124 mission : @entity2 , centre , pictured with members of @entity6 's @entity128 during the @entity37 @entity2 made his name in may 1943 , when he led ' @entity130 ' aimed at destroying the @entity132 and @entity133 dams			1
the @entity6 aces used @entity136 ' bouncing bomb to cause catastrophic flooding and wiping out scores of armament factories in @entity18 's @entity140			1
the next year , during an extended break from flying , @entity2 was encouraged to write his memoirs , which were published posthumously in 1946 under the title @entity124			2
immortalised : @entity143 playing @entity2 in the 1955 film @entity145 , which dramatised the raids on @entity18 's @entity140 valley @entity2 was the perfect choice to lead the @entity3 - colloquially dubbed ' the @entity3 ' - even though he was just 24 at the time			1
he had a flawless record , leadership skills and could fly the new @entity151			0
the success of the @entity3 , which wiped out the @entity132 and @entity133 dams and seriously damaged the @entity18 war effort - made @entity2 the most highly decorated pilot in the @entity6			1
the raid became one of the best - known operations of the war thanks to the 1955 film @entity145 , starring @entity143			0
he was awarded the @entity31 , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy			0
usually , former commanders moved on to senior office - based roles to see out the rest of the war after a successful raid			0
@entity171 leaders and politicians encouraged @entity2 to do so , as if he was captured or killed it would have seriously damaged @entity108 morale , but he insisted on retaining his place as an active pilot			2
he was initially posted at a @entity55 bomber base at @entity178 on a strictly non-operational basis			0
however , after persistent pestering from @entity2 , the top brass decided to let him lead a bomber squadron into @entity18			1
on september 19 , 1944 , @entity2 led a huge force into @entity18 to attack railways and industrial targets at @entity186 and @entity187			1
he did not return from the operation in his @entity16 fighter , and mystery and controversy have surrounded his crash ever since			0
@entity2 orchestrated the attack and ordered the bombers home , but was then never heard from again			2
his plane was seen plunging into the ground at @entity197 in @entity198			0
part of his remains were later found , and buried where they were discovered			0
on their way : @entity2 , second right , boards a @entity151 bomber along with other members of 617 squadron it was long thought that he had suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure , but in recent years it has been suggested that @entity2 was the victim of friendly fire			2
sir @entity136 , who invented the bouncing bomb , said of @entity2 : ' for some men of great courage and adventure , inactivity was a slow death			2
would a man like @entity2 ever have adjusted back to peacetime life ? ' one can imagine it would have been a somewhat empty existence after all he had been through			2
facing death had become his drug			0
' he had seen countless friends and comrades perish in the great crusade			0
perhaps something in him even welcomed the inevitability he had always felt that before the war ended he would join them in their @entity230			0
' he had pushed his luck beyond all limits and he knew it			0
but that was the kind of man he was			0
a man of great courage , inspiration and leadership			0
a man born for war - but born to fall in war			0
