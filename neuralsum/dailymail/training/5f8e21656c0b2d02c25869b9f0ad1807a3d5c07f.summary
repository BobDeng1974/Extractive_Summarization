the @entity1 ’s ‘ pitiful ’ forecasts were under fire last night after it was revealed it told councils in november to expect ‘ drier than usual ’ conditions this winter			1
in the worst weather prediction since @entity7 reassured the nation in october 1987 that there was no hurricane on the way , forecasters said a large area of the country which includes the @entity15 – still under water after more than two months of flooding – would most likely see rainfall levels well below average			1
last night , it was confirmed the @entity21 had instead suffered the wettest winter since records began			1
the @entity1 told councils in november to expect ' drier than usual ' conditions despite it being the wettest winter on record the three - month forecast , which a @entity1 spokesman conceded was ‘ experimental to some extent ’ , was given to councils , the @entity31 and other contingency planners to tell them what they could expect from december to the end of this month			1
it was for the whole of the @entity21 – not specific regions – but suggested only the east and south east might see average rainfall			1
the forecasters – using ‘ cutting - edge science ’ – assured councils there would be a ‘ significant reduction in precipitation compared to average ’ for most of the country , adding that there was only a 15 per cent chance the winter would fall into the ‘ wettest category ’			1
it will have been of little assistance to the many local authorities facing some of the most severe flooding @entity21 has seen in decades			1
@entity59 mp @entity58 said the @entity1 's track record is pitiful swathes of the country are still underwater , the @entity61 is still helping to pump out deluged homes and thousands of people have nowhere to live			0
last night it was confirmed that the past 90 days have seen the heaviest rainfall in more than a century			1
the @entity1 said the @entity21 had been drenched in 19.2in of rain since december , making it the wettest winter since records began in 1910			1
it had , it said , been exceptionally wet in the @entity70 , @entity71 , central @entity72 and across @entity73			0
mps and environmental planners yesterday said the long - term forecast had been a ‘ mistake which could have cost @entity21 dearly ’ and questioned whether the forecasting methods were fit for purpose			1
@entity59 mp @entity58 said : ‘ @entity1 is very good at predicting the weather it can see is coming ; but beyond that , its track record is pitiful			2
‘ many government agencies and some government policies are dependent on these @entity1 predictions and so these mistakes potentially are costing us dearly			0
’ environmental planner @entity89 said of the forecast : ‘ it was a load of poppycock			0
i do n’t know how they could have produced it and circulated it to emergency planners			0
there was no way that was going to be the case			0
‘ it was known in november there were changes in the jet stream coming through			0
it was speeding up , there was more oscillation , that means strong winds were going to be prevalent , and it was going to be a wet winter			2
an aerial shot of @entity111 in the flooded @entity15 which according to the @entity1 was going to enjoy a dry winter dredging is finally to restart on the @entity15 next month			1
flood victims whose homes and farms have been under water since @entity118 have laid the blame squarely at the door of the @entity31 , which stopped regular dredging in 1995			0
now , after pressure from the prime minister , officials will clear five - mile stretches of two rivers as soon as it is safe to do so			0
floods minister @entity128 said : ‘ today marks a crucial step forwards in ensuring local communities around the @entity15 are better protected			2
’ ‘ these forecasts affect decisions the authorities take , having the correct the @entity1 stopped publishing its long - range forecasts for the public to see in 2010 , after its disastrous prediction of a ‘ barbeque summer ’ in 2009 – which ended in washouts throughout july and august			2
the three - month forecasts are now sent only to contingency planners , such as councils , government departments , and insurance companies			0
the 90 - day forecast was issued at the end of november , and makes clear planners should also consult the forecasts released 30 and 15 days ahead which are more accurate			0
using the @entity1 ’s super-computer , which can perform 100trillion calculations a second , experts in november predicted there would be high - pressure weather systems across @entity21 ‘ with a slight signal for below average precipitation ’			1
@entity156 returns to his home wearing a dry suit in the flooded abandoned village of @entity111 , @entity15 , to pick up some cherished possessions including his wedding photographs volunteers check on a property as flood water continues to surround properties in the largely evacuated village of @entity111 in the @entity15 police officers in drysuits use a boat to patrol the flooded and largely evacuated village of @entity111 on the @entity15 but heavy rains began in december and the @entity15 has since seen some of its worst flooding ever , with hundreds of properties and farms affected			1
last month the flooding spread to the @entity177 and official figures suggest 6,500 properties have been affected			0
insurance companies fear the total bill could reach £ 1billion			0
a spokesman for the @entity1 said : ‘ our short and medium - term forecasts are the ones relied on by emergency responders to help them manage the impacts of severe weather			2
' the @entity1 ’s five - day forecasts and severe weather warnings have provided excellent guidance throughout this period of exceptionally stormy and wet weather			0
’ in response to this article , the @entity1 points out that long - term forecasts are experimental and its five day severe weather warnings this winter proved invaluable to the public and emergency services .			2
