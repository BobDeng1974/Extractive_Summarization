space might seem like a vast , empty expanse , but in reality the area surrounding @entity3 has become congested with junk			1
this junk – which can include anything from old rockets , abandoned satellites to missile shrapnel - will soon make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet			2
@entity14 ( @entity14 ) has now teamed up with @entity15 , a company that manufactures fishing equipment , to build a ‘ magnetic net ’ that can fish out space debris			1
it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity3 's orbit , travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph the first test of this equipment is scheduled for late february when a @entity29 rocket will be launched to deploy a satellite made by researchers at @entity32			1
once the satellite is in orbit , it will release a 300 metre - long wire net that will then generate a magnetic field strong enough to attract some of the debris in orbit			1
both the net and its contents will burn up as they enter @entity3 's atmosphere			1
based on a data archive , each miniature sphere in this image represents an existing object orbiting in space			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track since the first object , @entity55 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			1
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			2
it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity3 's orbit , traveling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph			1
one major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the @entity84 and @entity85 in the 1960s and 1970s			0
accidental events have also contributed to the problem			0
in february 2007 for instance , a @entity91 @entity90 booster stage exploded in orbit over @entity94			0
the possibility of a satellite crashing into a hunk of space debris has worried scientists for years			2
one collision could send thousands of pieces of debris spinning out , potentially destroying other satellites			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			0
television signals , weather forecasts , global - positioning navigation and international phone connections are just some of the services at risk			0
a recent @entity118 report said that the amount of space junk orbiting earth had reached a ' tipping point '			1
in 2009 there was a major crash between a @entity84 communications satellite and a defunct @entity91 military probe over @entity126			0
the collision at speeds of at least 15,000mph created a cloud of 1,500 pieces of space junk that the @entity132 then had to manoeuvre to avoid			2
a @entity134 missile test in 2007 left 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere			0
these two events encouraged the @entity84 to support the @entity139 when it issued guidelines that urge companies and countries to stop cluttering @entity3 's orbit .			1

next month , @entity29 rocket will be launched with a 300 metre - long net
the net will generate a magnetic field to attract some of the debris in orbit
both the net and its contents will burn up as they enter @entity3 's atmosphere
@entity118 *claims* amount of space junk around @entity3 has reached a ' tipping point '
