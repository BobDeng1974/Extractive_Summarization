' while officer @entity11 may have had other options or alternatives , we have concluded that we would be unable to prove that officer @entity11 's use of force was criminal			2

' protests have been going on for the past four days following the decisions not to indict @entity130 in the death of unarmed teen @entity42 and @entity132 in the ' chokehold ' death of @entity43			0
