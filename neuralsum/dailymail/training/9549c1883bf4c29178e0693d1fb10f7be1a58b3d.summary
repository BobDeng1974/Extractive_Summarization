the @entity0 are set to win the overall control of the @entity2 , according to new polling which gives the @entity4 leads in almost all the key battleground states			1
new surveys from @entity8 / @entity7 give the party leads over the opposition in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , which could lead to power in the upper house changing hands for the first time in eight years			1
it comes as their @entity20 opponents took a beating in a separate poll - which registered the highest disapproval from the party across all of @entity26 in 20 years			1
in @entity12 , challenger rep. @entity29 was given 45 per cent of the vote , while @entity39 incumbent , senator @entity31 , picked up 43 per cent			1
seven per cent were left undecided			0
@entity11 's race seemed closer , but still favored the @entity0 , with a 1 - point lead for rep. @entity42 , with 46 per cent , pipping senator @entity43 's 45 , with 5 per cent of voters undecided			2
@entity13 in the balance : @entity46 ( left ) is fighting for one of @entity13 's seats against @entity49 , the @entity49 challenger it is a marked change from polling last month , when @entity43 led by 6 points			2
in @entity13 , the third heavily - contested state , the polls gave the @entity4 's @entity46 a three - point lead over rep. @entity49			1
@entity46 got 49 per cent of the vote against @entity49 's 46 , with 5 per cent undecided			0
@entity57 also hangs in the balance , with neither party showing a clear lead			0

in the fight : @entity42 ( left ) has a decent lead over @entity43 incumbent @entity43 ( right ) in the upcoming election it came after a @entity69 poll delivered a bloody nose to @entity39 across the board , after 67 per cent of voters disapproved of their performance in congress			2
the disapproval rating is the highest the party has received for 20 years			0
however the same poll cast dire - though not unprecedented - predictions for the @entity4 , with a 72 per cent disapproval rating			1
