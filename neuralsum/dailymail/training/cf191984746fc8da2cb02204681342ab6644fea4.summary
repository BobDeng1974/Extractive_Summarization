by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 09:19 est , 21 may 2013 an obese man who shed nine stone of excess fat is now competing in bodybuilding competitions			1
@entity5 of @entity6 , north @entity7 , weighed in at 21 stone in 2010 and was given a warning by his doctor to lose weight			1
but after shedding the pounds and starting weight training he is now competing in bodybuilding championships , something he would never have thought possible just three years earlier			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , once weighed 21 stone but went down to 12 through eating healthily and dieting			1
he is now 14 stone after putting on two stone of muscle in the gym and competes in bodybuilding championships mr @entity5 , 33 , said : ' when i was in my early twenties i started my own window cleaning business which became quite successful			1
' i started to sit back in the office and became lazy			0
mr @entity5 , 33 , said : ' when my window cleaning business became successful i started to sit back in the office and became lazy ' ' i was n't going to the gym or anything and i was eating really bad food			1
' i would have three or four takeaways a week such as pizzas and kebabs			0
' i reached 21 and a half stone			1
' in 2010 , @entity5 took a trip to the doctor and was told to lose weight			1
it was the incentive he needed to change his lifestyle - and his diet - for good			0
' i went to the doctors and he told me i needed to lose weight for the good of my health			0
' it really was a kick up the backside , ' added @entity5			2
@entity5 said that while he looked at holiday photos and saw a large man looking back at him , he never saw himself as quite the weight he really was			2
' i did n't see myself as 21 stone , ' @entity5 confesses now			1
' when i looked back at pictures of myself on holiday i thought : " i need to lose weight "			0
' @entity5 stopped eating fat - laden takeaways in the evening			2
instead of spending time on the sofa , he started going to the gym , initially to lose weight and get back into shape , but later to build muscle and change his shape			0
he started spending every morning and evening in the gym , focusing mainly on cardiovascular work			0
after losing nine stone of excess fat @entity5 began to start weight training and went up to 14 stone - adding on two stone of muscle - and that is where his weight has settled now			1
mr @entity5 says he looks back at holiday photos and realises he was overweight ' it was really hard and took a lot of getting used to , but now i 've gone from one extreme to the other , ' he said			2
' i feel a lot fitter and a lot more confident and i do n't get tired just walking up the stairs anymore			0
' i 'm 33 but i feel better now than i ever did in my twenties			2
' @entity5 is still the owner of @entity75 in @entity6 , but now leads a healthier lifestyle with his partner @entity77 and his 15 - year - old son @entity78			1
he recently competed in the @entity79 at the @entity80 where he finished fourth			0
he now says that he has plans to compete in many more competitions in the future			0
@entity5 puts his success down to @entity85 , the owner of @entity86 where he works out daily			2
he said : ' i have to thank @entity85 and the gym for all the help they have given me			0
' without @entity85 this would n't have happened , he really helped me with my diet and regime			0
' mr @entity85 , who has worked as a nutritionist in the @entity6 area for 20 years said : ' it is a fantastic change			1
' to lose nine stone is one thing , but to transform two stone of that into muscle is really hard to do			2
' all the lads in the gym are shocked			0
