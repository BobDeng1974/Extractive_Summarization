it 's literally a case of there is no time like the present for the two giant pandas at @entity5 who have begun mating calls as their breeding window only lasts about 36 hours			1
zoo staff are hopeful that @entity10 and @entity11 will bring a little panda into the world as @entity11 's high - pitched sounds are said to be typical of a female panda undertaking mating behaviour			1
now that the pair are sexually mature , experts are more confident than ever as they predict @entity11 will ovulate within the next 24 hours with her playfulness increasing - especially in the water			2
if @entity11 successfully falls pregnant , which would n't be detected until about two weeks before birth , it will be the first time a panda is born in the @entity24			1
@entity5 vet @entity42 said staff were the most confident they had been that the pair will breed since the pandas arrived at the zoo from @entity47 in 2009			1
' they are sexually mature now - we have seen them go through puberty and develop over the last five years since they have been with us , ' he told @entity53			0
' last year we were still seeing relatively immature behaviour from @entity10 so we did n't have any confidence of natural breeding			2
' @entity11 's behaviour of late has also been a positive sign			0
' she has had an increase of vocalisation and a lot more water play and splashing around rather than being up in the trees - they often only come down when they are receptive , ' he said			0
@entity11 's high - pitched noises are a sign that she is getting ready for the breeding season experts predict @entity11 will ovulate within the next 24 hours judging from hormone testing taken @entity11 's playfulness is another sign that she is getting ready for the short mating season after putting the pair together for a short unsuccessful period last year , the staff tried artificial insemination			1
' although we saw better signs from them we did n't think putting them together would result in anything , so we tried artificial insemination but it was n't successful because his sperm count quality was n't great			0
' but this year is looking the most positive yet in the five years that the pandas have been living in @entity89 , as @entity10 is now nine years - old and @entity11 is eight			1
' we have progressively seen maturity in her and the male looks like he know more what 's hes doing as well , ' he said ' so we are a lot more hopeful and we are maximising the opportunity to breed naturally , and if we are not successful this year it will stand us in good stead for the future			0
' to give the process a little helping hand , the pandas are put in each other 's enclosures for periods of time			0
' we move them to swap scents from one enclosure to another so their pheromones will be going haywire , ' he said			0
' when they are exposed to the scents of the opposite sex then it really helps them develop sexually as well			0
' dr @entity42 said it was not known why pandas had such a small breeding window			2
the pandas are on loan from @entity47 for another four years			2
if @entity11 successfully falls pregnant , which would n't be detected until about two weeks before birth , it will be the first time a panda is born in the @entity24 @entity11 has four more years to fall pregnant in @entity89 before heading back to @entity47 @entity10 's sperm count was too low last year and he was not deemed sexually mature enough			1

@entity10 and @entity11 have only one chance per year to mate
their breeding window only lasts about 36 hours
the pandas have been at the @entity5 since 2009
if @entity11 falls pregnant it will be the first time a panda is born in the @entity24
the pair are on loan from @entity47 for another four years
