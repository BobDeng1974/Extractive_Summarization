tirade from beyond the grave : @entity1 branded political correctness an evil as big a threat to free speech as communism and fascism sir @entity8 could n’t have put it better			1
@entity1 , author of the @entity8 novels , branded political correctness an ‘ insidious ’ and ‘ dishonest ’ evil as big a threat to free speech as communism and fascism			1
the author of 12 books chronicling the further adventures of the sadistic bully from @entity20 , launched his tirade in an unpublished memoir just discovered by his family			1
@entity1 , who died in 2008 aged 82 , wrote : ‘ my chief concern is the kind of prejudice rooted in the fear of being thought illiberal			1
such attitudes are dangerous and intellectually dishonest			0
' but then , political correctness is by definition dishonest and is , i believe , the most insidious doctrine to plague the western world since those abominable soul mates communism and fascism with which it has more in common than its dupes seem to realise			1
‘ it can not face truth ; it rejects what is , simply because what is does not suit what the politically correct thinking ought to be			0
’ the comments are likely to delight fans of his books who love the character ’s bad behaviour			0
@entity8 ’s womanising , heavy drinking , casual racism , bullying and outrageous cowardice make him one of the most un-pc characters in the whole of @entity59 literature			0
@entity1 , who wrote several @entity61 film scripts , also recalls how he was forced to remove a scene based on real events where unscrupulous white whisky traders peddled alcohol to @entity66 for fears scenes of drunken ‘ @entity68 ’ would upset their descendants			2
bully : @entity70 as @entity8 and his co-star @entity71 in @entity72 , based on a @entity8 book he writes : ‘ they would n’t like to think that it happened , so it mus n’t be shown happening , even though it did			0
’ his family discovered the manuscript , called @entity82 , six weeks ago while sorting out his collection of papers			2
a @entity85 is a teller of tales from the @entity87			0
the manuscript is not dated but the author ’s reference in it to having written 11 @entity8 books means it was written between 1999 and 2005			0
successful author : @entity1 ( right ) , who died in 2008 aged 82 , wrote 12 books chronicling the further adventures of the sadistic bully from @entity20 , including @entity72 ( left ) his daughter @entity97 , who found the manuscript , said : ‘ it has n’t been published anywhere and i think he wrote it with an eye on posterity			1
’ the author ’s family are selling his extensive working library of 2,500 books through the @entity110 bookseller @entity111 , which will publish the manuscript at the end of may to coincide with the sale of the books from june 2 .			2
