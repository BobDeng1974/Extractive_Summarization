there was no escaping the soggy weather for fashionistas in @entity3 on saturday morning as designer @entity4 added umbrellas and a rainy day soundtrack to her show			1
@entity9 designer @entity8 , one of the duchess of @entity12 's go - to labels for smart daytime dressing , was one of the first shows of the second day of the fashion extravaganza			1
instead of a standard catwalk she created a retro set at the @entity19 building where models wrapped up in teddy bear coats , pastel - coloured wool and pretty swing dresses			2
@entity8 's @entity25 show mirrored the city 's wet weather the @entity9 designer 's signature style is ' colour , pattern and texture with a @entity34 twist ' @entity8 describes her signature style as ' colour , pattern and texture with a 60s twist			1
' here white tights , chunky shoes and oversized @entity43 collars gave the looks that sweet @entity34 edge that @entity47 channels so well , while knee - length hems , safe cuts and lots of sleeves will no doubt keep the @entity10 coming back for more			1
@entity53 shoes , thick tights and oversized @entity43 collars injected a retro vibe into a very wearable , if not very glamorous , collection @entity8 's sixties take on the furry teddy bear coat , which has been a huge hit this winter meanwhile , designer @entity59 seemed to be doing everything she can to move away from that pretty pink dress that duchess @entity62 once chose to wear for a @entity64 tea party			1
her smouldering @entity25 collection took influence from film noir with edgy looking models stomping down the catwalk in leather dresses , snakeskin coats and embellished socks			1
so far so not @entity62			0
@entity10 of @entity12 in an @entity8 bird - print dress at a charity event in @entity3 ( l ) and a pale pink @entity59 dress for a @entity64 garden party waists were nipped and skirts were flared managing to be incredibly sexy despite a serious absence of flesh : a calf here , a flash of midriff there			1
pops of colour came in fuchsia gowns and rainbow - coloured lace and most looks were finished with spiked , metallic @entity92 heels , slicked hair and a scowl from the models			0
dramatic snakeskin pieces and spiked @entity92 heels added edge to @entity59 's @entity101 show pops of colour came in mustard and cerulean lace turtle necks and slicked hair gave the show a more serious vibe than previous collections the standout piece for most of the attending fashion press was a fuchsia gown which has already enjoyed a red carpet moment as model @entity113 wore a pastel version of the dress to a @entity118 party			1
@entity113 did n't make an appearance on saturday 's front row , but @entity25 regulars @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 were there to up the glamour factor , with @entity122 choosing a bright striped dress from @entity59 's spring / summer collection dressed down with a casualparka , in her signature @entity131 eccentric style			1
a fuchsia gown was the standout piece of the show ( @entity136 ) @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 front row at @entity138 @entity141 's lead make - up artist , @entity139 , created , what she described as , a raw nude look for the @entity59 show today			1
for the base , she prepped with the brand 's newly launching primer , which coated the skin with a @entity149 effect and added longevity			2
she then neutralised and corrected the skin with each of the brand 's five new cc sticks , which were hand - picked by the legendary @entity155 and are due to launch in april			2
' these sticks neutralise any imperfections , so if you 're quite sallow , we 've got the purple to bring skin back to life and the green stick , which helps with redness , and we have a highlighter stick too , ' explained @entity139			0
raw nude : @entity139 created a very subtle and matte complexion for today 's show she then applied a warm nude highlighter to the cheekbones with her fingertips and completed the look with the new @entity175 shade , @entity176 , a lovely warm nude that really brings the lips to life			2
' we do n't want it to be too glamorous , the clothes do the talking so we wanted the look to be quite a contrast , ' she said			0
there was a difference backstage this season , @entity139 was wearing the brand new @entity189 , which captured exactly what she saw as she created the beauty look			0
@entity139 said : ' being backstage is an exciting time for a make - up artist			0
it ’s a prime opportunity to get really creative and use the latest products for the first time			0
' by using @entity189 this season , you ’ll be able to see exactly how i ’m creating the look ; a make - up artist view on camera that has not been seen before			0
' women can then follow this process and create all or parts of the look themselves at home			0
' i think we are going to be seeing them a lot more in the world of make - up artistry			0
i am chuffed to be pioneering it			0
' now that 's cool ! @entity139 ( bottom right ) used @entity189 this season , so fans are able to see exactly how she created the look ; a make - up artist view on camera that has not been seen before			2
