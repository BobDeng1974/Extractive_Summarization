@entity0 has said the voices of overseas territories are dangerously ' muted ' in @entity3 and they should be allowed to elect their own mp the @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity3 ’s other overseas territories should be given a seat in the @entity9 , @entity0 said yesterday			1
the @entity11 leader claims their voices are dangerously ‘ muted ’ in @entity3 and they should be allowed to elect their own ‘ mp for the @entity14 ’			1
he points to @entity15 , which reserves seats in both of its houses of @entity19 for dependencies including @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			0
last year @entity15 elected its first mp for @entity3 because @entity25 has so many @entity23 expatriates			2
both @entity6 and the @entity5 had ‘ big neighbours behaving with increasing belligerence ’ , mr @entity0 said			1
‘ the voice of these lands , however , is muted in @entity25			2
they have shown us loyalty : is n’t it about time we reciprocated ? ’ there are 14 overseas territories – parts of our former empire that have not acquired independence or have voted to stay @entity3			2
collectively , the territories have a population of 260,000 people and a land area of approximately 667,000 square miles			1
mr @entity0 said : ' let us copy the @entity23			1
give the crown dependencies a @entity46 seat , so that their voice can be heard in the chamber and at the top table of @entity3 politics			0
' the current minister responsible for the @entity14 is @entity52 , of the @entity53			1
@entity6 , however , is the responsibility of the @entity55 @entity24 mp , while the @entity5 are the responsibility of @entity57 , another @entity53 minister			0
but mr @entity0 said that the @entity58 had 27 seats reserved for its overseas dependencies , with 21 representatives in its other legislative house , the @entity63			1
he suggests one ‘ mp for the territories ’ should represent all of @entity3 ’s overseas territories			2
‘ before anybody says that the combined population for these territories would make this difficult we must remember that the old @entity74 seat now called ‘ a h - @entity76 an @entity75 ’ , has a population of less than @entity6 alone , ’ the @entity11 leader insisted			0
mr @entity0 pointed to an unhappy historic precedent - when @entity78 was declined three mps in the @entity46 and went on to break away from @entity3			1
collectively , the territories have a population of 260,000 people and a land area of approximately 667,000 square miles			1
pictured is @entity86 beach and the @entity87 ‘ before @entity78 became independent it was offered full integration with the @entity3 , including three mps			0
a referendum was held in 1956 on the island and 77 per cent voted in favour of the proposal , ’ he said			0
‘ sadly the turnout was only 60 per cent - how we long for turnouts of 60 per cent today - and under the rules of the time the result was regarded as void			0
‘ @entity3 rejected the result , @entity78 did n’t get the @entity79 , slowly the path was set and its government became increasingly anti @entity3 , setting up deals with @entity105 and becoming a republic			0
‘ if the @entity3 had had the wit at the time to accept that referendum , welcome @entity78 mps and integrate fully @entity78 would be a contented part of the @entity3			0
so let us take up the challenge , and welcome those far - flung parts of the @entity116 ’s territories as full members of our family			0

@entity0 claims voices of territories are dangerously ' muted '
territories collectively have 260,000 people and land area of 667,000 sq miles
mr @entity0 says they should be able to elect their own ' mp for the @entity14 '
