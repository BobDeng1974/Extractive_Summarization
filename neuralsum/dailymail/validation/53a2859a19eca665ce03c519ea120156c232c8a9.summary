in a genetic first , scientists have sequenced the largest ever set of human genomes from a single population			1
the epic undertaking involved sequencing the @entity6 of 2,636 @entity7 and comparing them with the partial sequences of another 104,000			0
among several key finds , the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' - our most recent common male ancestor - lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago			1
the epic undertaking involved sequencing the dna of 2,636 @entity7 and comparing them with the partial sequences of another 104,000 revealing insights into human evolution scientists see @entity7 as a goldmine for doing genetics research			2
the country was founded by a small group of settlers from @entity28 arriving about 1,100 years ago and it remained isolated for the next thousand years			0
because the population in @entity7 has very little genetic diversity , scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily			1
@entity7 also has strong genealogical record , as a result of well - preserved historical documents			0
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates , contradicts earlier findings that claim the father of all humans lived around 340,000 years ago			0
scientists now estimate his age to be 239,000 years old – a date closer to humanity 's most common female ancestor who is believed to have lived 200,000 years ago			2
as well as evolutionary insights , scientists say the dataset will help them discover ' mutant genes ' that naturally protect a rare group of people from certain diseases			2
so far , the work has provided promising results helping identify 20 million genetic variants among the @entity7 population			1
among these variations , scientists at @entity61 - based @entity60 have already found genes that increase the risks of alzheimer 's disease , liver and thyroid problems			1
' this work is a demonstration of the unique power sequencing gives us , ' said @entity72 , founder of @entity60 , who led the research			0
' this is very much more than a molecular national selfie , ' he added			0
' we 're contributing to important tools for making more accurate diagnostics for rare diseases			0
' @entity72 's team today published four papers online in @entity81 , all of which used the @entity7 data			1
among several key finds , the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago			1
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates ( pictured ) , contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago they detail mutations in the @entity97 gene that are associated with an increased risk of alzheimer 's disease			1
six of the eight mutations in @entity97 were also found to be present in other populations of @entity28 ancestry , including the @entity104 , indicating that the results are not specific to the @entity7 population			1
they also identify a variant of the gene @entity108 that is significantly associated with the risk of developing liver disease			1
@entity112 , a geneticist at the @entity113 who was not involved in the study told @entity115 that discovering a rare association this way ' is a bit of a holy grail ' for geneticists			0
' large scale whole - genome sequencing of the @entity7 population ' this study demonstrates how @entity60 is able to use national genealogies to infer rare genetic mutations throughout the population			1
' identification of a large set of rare complete human knockouts ' the scale and detail of the data was used to identify more than a thousand knocked out genes in the population			2
the study found nearly eight per cent of the 104,000 people studied having at least one gene that do n't work			1
' the y - chromosome point mutation rate in humans ' the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' - our most recent common male ancestor - would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago			2
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates , contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago ' loss - of - function variants in @entity97 confer risk of alzheimer 's disease ' this study details mutations in the @entity97 gene that are associated with an increased risk of alzheimer 's disease			1
six of the eight mutations in @entity97 were also found to be present in other populations of @entity28 ancestry , including the @entity104 , indicating that the results are not specific to the @entity7 population			1
a separate study reveals that 8,000 @entity7 – around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that does n't function at all			1
the most common genes that were muted were those associated with a person 's sense of smell , and overall , the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced			2
the scientists now intend to recall those @entity7 with knock - out genes as part of a new study to try to identify any physical differences or diseases that have caused the silenced genes			1
the work was funded by @entity182 , a @entity183 - based biotechnology company that paid $ 415 million for @entity61 , @entity7 - based @entity60 two years ago			0
it is now basing its research projects against @entity60 's database to make sure its medications are aimed at the right people			0
but some experts are wary of the results			0
they say the @entity7 population has a unusual demographic history because the country is isolated , with only around 320,000 inhabitants			2
a separate study reveals that 8,000 @entity7 – around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that does n't function at all			1
overall , the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced @entity201 , a geneticist at @entity202 who did n't take part in the studies told @entity205 said this means that the ' sample studied is not exactly healthy , is somewhat opportunistic , and probably does n't correspond to any ' real ' population			2
' but @entity72 says that the results should still be representative of people in other areas because the @entity7 population does n't meet any of the requirements for interbreeding			1
the scientists are now trying to decide whether they will provide the study participants with information their genetic risk for various diseases			2
@entity72 's own view is that ' it would be a crime ' not to let them know			0
scientists see @entity7 as a goldmine for doing genetics research			0
the country was founded by a small group of settlers from @entity28 arriving about 1,100 years ago and it remained isolated for the next thousand years			0

@entity7 also has strong genealogical record , as a result of well - preserved historical documents			0
@entity72 says look at the genetics databases from the top down , rather than from the bottom up , could result in some breakthroughs in medicine			0
' i 'm 100 percent sure that we will find more protective mutations , ' he told @entity246 news			0
' i 'm absolutely convinced these protective mutations are going to be important when it comes to pointing us toward good drug targets			0

scientists sequenced largest ever set of genomes from a single nation
the data reveals some *surprising* genetic mutations in @entity7 people
@entity264 also revealed that the father of humanity is older than first thought
eight per cent of the population has a gene that does n't function at all
study found genes that increase the risk of @entity275 's and liver disease
scientists say data will help them develop better *treatments* for disease
