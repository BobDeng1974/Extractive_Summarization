by @entity0 published : 03:37 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 8 march 2013 the top @entity2 dancer accused of masterminding the acid attack on artistic director @entity4 - and paying £ 1085 for it to be carried out - was today refused bail			1
@entity6 , 29 , was remanded in custody until at least 18 april as the probe goes on into the ballet scandal			2
@entity6 , admitted in court ordering attack on @entity4 , 42 , but claimed he wanted an accomplice to ' beat him up ' and did not sanction the use of sulphuric acid , which left the ex-dancer partially blind and his face disfigured from severe burns			1
admission : @entity6 looks out from the defendant 's holding cell during a court hearing in @entity21 the top @entity22 dancer accused of masterminding the acid attack on artistic director @entity4 , right , has admitted he paid just £ 1085 to get revenge for not giving his girlfriend the good roles an alleged accomplice , @entity27 , is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles , around £ 1,080 , from @entity6 to attack @entity4			1
while accepting he wanted his boss beaten up , he insisted : ' it 's not true that i ordered him to throw acid at @entity32 '			2
' i told @entity27 about the policies of the @entity22 , about the bad things going on , the corruption , ' he said			0
' when he said : ` ok , let me beat him up , hit him over the head , ' i agreed , but that is all that i admit to doing			0
' defence lawyer @entity38 said : ' my client never had any intention of causing such harm to health , all the more in such a loathsome way like disfiguring the face or the loss of sight			0
' several @entity2 dancers came to court to support him , adding to other voices claiming there are still more surprises over this murky case			2
@entity53 insisted @entity6 was not guilty			2
' we do not have anything to prove it but simply all of us are certain about it			0
we think it is a terrible mistake			0
' ' there have always been conflicts in @entity2 but it does not mean that one of our colleagues can be made a criminal , ' added @entity64			2
@entity27 and alleged driver @entity65 were also remanded in custody			0
allegations : @entity6 ( right ) is said top have ordered the attack after his ' partner ' @entity71 ( right ) was snubbed for a role arrests : alleged masked attacker @entity79 ( left ) and @entity65 ( right ) , the driver who took part in attack on @entity4 , have both confessed to their involvement , police say the case has become more murky as @entity4 claimed from hospital in @entity83 that @entity85 police have failed to arrest all those responsible while a prominent ex-prima ballerina alleges a full scale cover - up is underway			1
' it 's not true that i ordered him to throw acid at @entity92 , ' he said			2
he was motivated by fury at @entity92 snubbing his partner 21 - year - old @entity71 , claim police			1
' the main reason he gave to the investigator is revenge , ' a police source told @entity98			0
' @entity4 did not let her play leading dancing roles in the @entity2			1
@entity6 stressed that he did not ask for an acid attack and wanted the attackers only to beat @entity4			1
' arrest : @entity85 police used mobile phone data to arrest the trio for the acid attack on @entity4 , ( pictured ) artistic director of @entity85 's world - famous @entity22 ballet @entity2 's artistic director , @entity4 before the attack @entity6 - who faces up to 12 years in jail if found guilty - claimed in court that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 january attack on @entity4			1
' when i heard what happened to @entity4 , i was just in shock , ' he said			2
' i could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid			0
' i did not order harm done to this man			0
' however , @entity6 and accomplices evidently also hacked 16,000 emails of top @entity2 figures as he sought to prove that @entity4 demanded a percentage of fees obtained by troupe members in tv or sponsored dancing engagements outside the theatre			1
' if you want to take part in something like this , you must make an agreement with the boss and , as far as i know , share your profits , ' he said			0
@entity4 has not commented on this claim but speaking through his wife @entity140 told how he suspicions about @entity6 - but believed that a ' much wider ' circle of people linked to the theatre were involved			1
she claimed those guilty included ' not just the three who they arrested			0
we hope the security forces unearth all those people who are connected to this crime			0
' she also strongly disputed that @entity6 's anger over @entity154 was the only reason behind the attack			2
this theory was ' exceptional and wild ' , said said , adding : ' it is unlikely that it is all because of one ballerina			0
@entity4 thinks that motives for this crime are a bit different			2
and this girl is just a cause but surely not the main reason for the crime			0
' her comments suggest that a plot to blind and disfigure @entity4 with acid may go much wider and perhaps higher at the @entity2			1
meanwhile , 37 year old @entity172 - well known to @entity174 audiences and once controversially fired by the @entity2 for being allegedly overweight - expressed doubt that @entity6 was really the key player behind the attack			1
dancer : sources say that @entity6 may been upset about the treatment of his @entity2 partner @entity71 , 21 , pictured above performance : @entity6 as @entity182 in @entity2 in november ' i have got my own idea			1
it seems to me that all this is a fake version and has nothing to do with the accident , ' she said			0
' the administration of the @entity2 is trying to disclaim its guilt and to kill all suspicions			0
' alleging a cover - up , she said : ' all that is going on now is an attempt to take the suspicions away from the administration which may have been connected to this event			0
' another @entity2 source added doubt to the police version that @entity6 was the mastermind			1
' @entity4 certainly squeezed out @entity71 , but that is not a reason to throw acid in someone 's face			1
' crisis : general view of the hall from the @entity22 stage in @entity21 - the attack on @entity4 plunged the @entity2 into a grave crisis			1

dancer @entity6 said to have ' ordered ' attack on @entity4
' the motive of the crime was the *hostile* *personal* relationship , ' police said
@entity2 director @entity4 had sulphuric acid thrown at him on 17 january
his face was disfigured and *eyesight* *damaged* after attack outside his flat
row may be linked to @entity4 's snub of dancer 's partner @entity71
vicious attack *sparked* a major probe involving key figures in the theatre
two other men , the attacker and the driver , also sign written *confessions*
