the @entity0 said tuesday it would exhume and try to identify the remains of nearly 400 sailors and @entity3 killed when the @entity4 sank in the bombing of @entity6			1
the ship capsized after being hit by nine torpedoes during the december 7 , 1941 surprise attack from @entity11 forces			1
altogether , 429 sailors and @entity3 onboard were killed			1
only 35 were identified in the years immediately after			0
hundreds were buried as unknowns at cemeteries in @entity16			2
in 1950 , they were reburied as unknowns at the @entity18 - also known as the @entity18 - inside a volcanic crater in @entity20			0
above , the ship seen capsized after the attack resting place : the sailors and @entity3 who died on board the @entity4 are currently buried as unknowns in @entity20 's @entity18 @entity32 : @entity33 , a gravestone at @entity20 's @entity18 , marking the resting place of seven unknown @entity36 who died on board the @entity4 the military is acting now , nearly 75 years after the men died , because advances in forensic science and technology as well as genealogical help from family members have made it possible to identify more remains , said lt. col. @entity47 , a @entity48 spokeswoman			1
the move is apparently a part of a new @entity0 policy on disinterring the remains of unknown troops			1
according to the new policy , bodies may be exhumed from @entity18 or any other permanent @entity36 military cemeteries - but they can not be removed from any @entity58 vessel that is being used as a national memorial , like the @entity60 which remains sunk and on display in @entity20			1
the bodies of @entity3 and sailors lost at sea do not apply to this new effort			2
in order to disinter these large groups , researchers must also prove that they can identify at least 60 per cent of the group with supplied family dna samples , medical and dental records			2
' the secretary of defense and i will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one 's remains will be recovered , identified , and returned to you as expeditiously as possible , and we will do so with dignity , respect and care , ' deputy secretary of defense @entity72 said in a statement			2
' while not all families will receive an individual identification , we will strive to provide resolution to as many families as possible			0
' officials plan to begin the work in three to six weeks , @entity47 said			0
they aim to identify the remains of up to 388 servicemen within five years			1
in 2003 , the military disinterred one casket at the @entity18 based on information provided by @entity94 , a @entity6 survivor who has spent years doggedly scouring documents			1
loss of life : the @entity4 was hit with nine torpedoes in the assault , which caused the boat to tip over and capsize - trapping many inside revenge : the @entity4 pictured above before the attack			1
overall , more than 2,000 @entity36 died in the surprise attack on december 7 , 1941 which sparked the entrance of the @entity36 into @entity106 watery grave : the capsized deck of the @entity4 is seen on may 24 , 1943 - two and a half years after the attack rescue : after the ship capsized , survivors worked hard in an attempt to rescue some of those trapped inside many remains were comingled when buried , and the military was able to identify five servicemen from that casket			1
but the coffin also contained the remains of up to 100 others who have n't been identified			2
' it 's something i looked forward to for a long time , ' @entity94 told @entity125 about tuesday 's news			2
the @entity0 started notifying families on tuesday about the plans to disinter and identify the bodies			1
if a body is identified , the family will be notified and the sailor or @entity3 's remains returned to them for a full military burial			2
@entity137 of @entity138 , @entity136 was one of the first to hear about the plans			0
@entity141 told the @entity142 that he received a call from the @entity144 , about his brother @entity145 who died at the age of 19 on board the @entity4			1
@entity145 worked in the boiler room on the port side of the ship , which was hit by @entity11 torpedos			1
the onslaught caused the ship to roll over and capsize - trapping much of the crew inside			0
' i can hardly talk , ' @entity155 , 82 , said of receiving the call			0
' families want some kind of closure			0
' @entity155 says his parents received a telegram right before christmas 1941 , saying @entity145 was missing , and then another two months later saying he had died			0
' and that 's all they ever got			0
they never got any information about @entity18 cemetery			0
they never heard of a @entity18 cemetery , ' @entity155 said			0
@entity155 said his parents tried hard to get information on where their son was buried , even seeking the help of a local congressmen			0
if identified , @entity155 says he already has a burial plot ready for his brother .			0
