by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 10 august 2013 commons speaker @entity1 is planning to stand down after the next election – paving the way for a sensational return to @entity5 by @entity6			1
mr @entity1 has told the local @entity8 association in @entity9 that he will resign as speaker in the middle of the next @entity5			1
it means there will be a by - election in the ultra-safe @entity16 seat just over a year after mr @entity6 completes his second term as @entity19 mayor			1
transition : sources have confirmed that @entity6 is being lined up to take commons speaker @entity1 's @entity9 seat during the next election high - level sources have told @entity24 is already being identified by local party grandees as mr @entity1 ’s ideal successor – and that the speaker is ‘ privately inclined ’ to be ‘ helpful ’ to the mayor			1
they added the constituency would select mr @entity6 ‘ in about ten seconds flat ’			2
the news is likely to be greeted with groans in @entity32 , which had hoped that the @entity6 leadership bandwagon was running out of steam			1
mr @entity6 recently reassured @entity36 ’s circle that he will not seek to return to the @entity37 in a by - election before 2015 , and nor would he stand in that year ’s general election			2
but the no 10 aides were left with the impression he would start plotting his @entity43 comeback shortly afterwards			0
mr @entity1 ’s decision stems from a promise , made to the constituency association when he became speaker in 2009 , that he would serve a maximum of nine years before stepping down and allowing a return to ‘ normal politics ’ in @entity9			1
by tradition , a @entity1 stands for @entity5 as an independent and is unopposed by the main parties			2
last night , the speaker ’s office confirmed mr @entity1 ’s pledge , meaning mr @entity6 could be campaigning on the stump in @entity9 by the end of 2017			1
true blue : @entity9 is a rock solid @entity16 seat which had a whopping 18,000 @entity8 majority last time it was openly contested it is a plum seat			2
at the last openly contested election in 2005 , mr @entity1 won with a whopping majority of more than 18,000			0
it is an hour ’s drive from @entity19 , where mr @entity6 has his family home , and directly adjacent to his former @entity70 constituency			1
mr @entity6 , whose ambition to become party leader and prime minister remains undimmed , is reluctant to serve for an extended period under mr @entity36			2
@entity6 aides now suggest that the master plan is for him to serve out his full @entity78 term until may 2016 , enabling him to keep the ‘ solemn vow ’ he made to @entity82 to not combine the mayoralty with ‘ any other political capacity ’			1
he would then spend 12 to 18 months building up a campaign war chest , through writing , public speaking and media appearances , before standing in a rock - solid seat			0
by that point , his advisers expect mr @entity36 to either be struggling with a small @entity16 majority or confined to a second term of @entity92 – or to have resigned after losing narrowly to @entity93 in 2015			0
until now , it had been expected that @entity6 would return to the @entity37 by persuading a ‘ stooge ’ mp to stand aside for him			0
mr @entity1 ’s plans remove that need			0
last night , a @entity37 source said : ‘ @entity1 has organised his personal life around this pledge , but only a few people in the know have realised			0
he will publicly reiterate it in his 2015 “ manifesto ” for @entity9			0
‘ it means it is one of the longest - signalled by - elections in recent political history			0
he and @entity6 get on well , so @entity1 would be inclined to be helpful in terms of the precise timing of his departure			1
’ the source added : ‘ the activists in his patch are keen on the idea			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity1 said : ‘ mr speaker has previously indicated he would n’t expect to do more than nine years ’			0
he added that mr @entity1 and mr @entity6 had not discussed the issue			1
mr @entity6 ’s office did not respond to messages .			0

@entity1 to resign @entity9 seat in the middle of next *parliament*
high - level sources say @entity6 lined up for seat in 2016
plan confirms that @entity19 mayor 's leadership ambitions remain undimmed
