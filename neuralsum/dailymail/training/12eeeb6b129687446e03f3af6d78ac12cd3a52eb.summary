by @entity0 a primary school has banned children from drinking squash because it is too unhealthy			1
youngsters at @entity6 in @entity7 are only allowed to drink a choice of orange juice , milk or water			1
however , some parents claim their children are becoming dehydrated and going without a drink all day because they will only drink cordial squash			1
@entity16 who has been told not to drink cordial at school pictured with his mum @entity18 parents have branded the school ’s claims that cordial drinks are unhealthy as ' nonsense ' because the orange juice allowed is loaded with sugar			1
they accused the school of double standards because they happily allow crisps and chocolate as well as serving up fattening sponge cakes , cookies and cream and custard desserts in the school canteen			0
mother - of - four @entity18 , 32 , says her four - year - old son @entity37 has been going thirsty while at school and has called for an end to the ' barmy ' restrictions			0
however , scrooge school bosses have refused to back down on the rules , insisting parents must get a note from a doctor if they want their children to drink the cordials			1
@entity16 's parents believe their son is becoming dehydrated and going without a drink all day mrs @entity18 , who sends @entity37 to school with a no added - sugar 10 calorie @entity53 drink each day , said : ' i was sending my son to school with cordial in his lunchbox and he was coming home with it at the end of the day			1
' he was not being allowed to drink it			1
' he was coming home thirsty			0
i asked the head teacher why and they said they were n’t allowing it on health grounds			0
mrs @entity18 sends @entity37 to school with a no added - sugar 10 calorie fruitshoot drink each day ' but there is sugar in pure fruit juice , so i do n’t accept that explanation			2
it ’s also very acidic , which is n’t good for his teeth			0
' there ’s less calories in the cordial i am sending him to school with			0
there ’s three calories in the ones i buy and up to 115 calories in orange juice the school provides			1
' where is the logic in that ? ' i do n’t want him to drink milk in this hot weather as it ’s not stored in the fridge and he does n’t like water			1
' my son wo n’t drink any of them , so what is he supposed to do ? he is going thirsty and that is dangerous for his health			2
' ironically i asked about the chocolate and crisps in his lunchbox and they said " oh , that ’s absolutely fine "			0
' that ’s even more unhealthy than a no - added sugar cordial drink and they serve up custard and cream and sponge cakes quite happily			2
' it ’s just double standards really			0
' full - time mum @entity18 , who lives in @entity6 , @entity113 , with husband @entity114 , 33 , a bus driver , is now starting a petition to get the ban dropped			1
she added : ' i ’ve had so much support , all the other parents think it is ridiculous too			2
' we just want common sense to prevail in the end , it ’s just nonsense and completely barmy			0
' @entity124 , whose five - year - old daughter @entity125 is also going without a drink all day , said : ' she has been coming out of school saying she is very thirsty			0
' she wo n’t drink water and i want her to have cordial			2
@entity16 's parents have started a petition calling for children to be allowed to drink squash ' but they have said that if she goes into school with cordial she will have it taken off her			1
' i keep sending her with cordial			0
i do n’t believe it is that unhealthy			0
' another parent , who did not want to be named , said : ' i know kids , including my own , are going without a drink because of this			0
' the school should reconsider			0
' they are children , they do n’t understand that if they do not take in liquids they can become dehydrated and very ill. @entity144 energy : 10calories protein : trace sugar : 1.6g fat : trace @entity151 200ml energy : 100calories protein : 1.4g sugar : @entity155 fat : trace ' the school is preventing them from drinking something they will actually take in and is putting our children in real danger			2
' earlier this year , research by experts at @entity167 revealed that drinking fruit juice , including pure orange juice , can be harmful			1
they said a 250ml serving of orange juice contains 115 calories			1
@entity174 said it was following county council guidelines			1
headteacher @entity176 added : ' if parents do n’t wish their child to bring in water for medical reasons , we have asked them to supply a doctor ’s letter			2
' the reason we introduced this policy is that although the majority of parents were sending their child in with water , some children were bringing in sugar - laden fizzy or still drinks every day , which were having an adverse effect on their behaviour by the afternoons when some were becoming disruptive in class			1
' bringing in water also means that children can easily top up their bottles during the day , especially when the weather is warm , to keep them hydrated			2
' youngsters at @entity6 in @entity7 are only allowed to drink orange juice , milk or water a @entity204 contains 10 calories while a 200ml glass of orange juice has 100 calories the school which caters for 179 children aged between three and seven was rated as ' good ' in all areas after an @entity213 inspection in 2012			1
the report claimed that the school needed to ' improve the effectiveness of leadership and management and quality of teaching			0
' in january this year @entity222 in @entity223 , @entity221 banned fruit juices from school lunchboxes due to their unhealthy calorie content .			0
