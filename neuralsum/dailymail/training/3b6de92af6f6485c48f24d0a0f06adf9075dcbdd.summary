by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 02:02 est , 12 july 2012 just six after @entity1 celebrated the birth of its first panda bear in 24 years the newborn cub has died			1
the young bear is thought to have developed pneumonia and was discovered on its back lying on its mother 's chest at @entity11 in @entity12			1
it was the first time the zoo 's natural breeding programme had led to a birth , and heartwarming photos of proud mother @entity18 cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world			1
keepers tried to massaged the panda 's heart after it was found at the zoo , but the cub was declared dead an hour later			1
experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally , particularly when they are on public display			0
the birth was captured on night vision webcam and a video showing @entity18 giving birth and holding the tiny baby to her chest was released by the zoo			1
the cub was the first panda to be born after being conceived naturally in @entity1 history			0
the task is extremely difficult task as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours over the entire year and can only become pregnant during a 24 hour slot			2
in the wild female pandas normally have a cub every two or three years			0
love and care : @entity18 cuddles her newly born baby holding the cub close to her chest the unnamed cub was too young to have gained the characteristic black marks and its size is not living up to the name of @entity68 the baby panda was still unnamed when it died , but suggestions for names had caused a stir even before it was born			1
@entity18 's pregnancy was only announced by @entity1 governor @entity74 last month			1
he said the bear would be called @entity76 or @entity77 – a wordplay on the disputed @entity79 which are part of @entity1 but are claimed by both @entity81 and @entity82			2
the giant panda is threatened by loss of habitat , poaching and a low reproduction rate			0
females in the wild normally have a cub once every two to three years			0
only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild , mostly in @entity82 's southwestern @entity94 province			2
around 300 live in captivity mostly in @entity82 breeding centres and zoos but also in foreign zoos around the world			0
@entity82 ’s policy on panda export is very strict in order to protect their national symbol			0
a panda is never sold to a foreign country , but is instead on loan for a yearly fee of up to £ 650,000			0
there is also a clause that any cubs born during the loan belong to the @entity82 and have to be returned within two years			1
he got a quick response from @entity116 spokesman @entity115 regarding the islands , known to the @entity82 as the @entity79			0
speaking at a press conference in the capital the spokesman said : ‘ @entity74 ’s scheme to undermine @entity82 - @entity1 relations is a clumsy performance			2
it will only tarnish the image of @entity1 and @entity12 , ’ ‘ no matter what names the @entity1 side gives , it can not change the fact that the two pandas belong to @entity82			0
‘ likewise , what names @entity1 gives to the @entity79 and the adjacent isles , it can not change the fact that these islands belong to @entity82			0
’ the zoo 's panda team , comprised of five workers and four veterinarians , will continue using two cameras to observe the pair 24 hours a day for about a week , and have been joined by a breeding expert from @entity94 , @entity82 , where @entity18 grew up			1
visitors to the zoo eager to see the baby will be disappointed as @entity11 , which is the oldest in @entity1 , has expressed wishes to keep the cub and mother away from the public for another six months			2
@entity18 and her mate , @entity152 , are on loan from @entity82 for 10 years			1
under the terms of the agreement between @entity1 and @entity82 , the cub will be sent back in two years			1
sad : experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally , particularly when they are on public display video : staff from the @entity11 in @entity12 are visibly upset about the death of the panda ...			0
