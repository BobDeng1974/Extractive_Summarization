rage : the owners of @entity70 respond to their ' haters ' on @entity72 after the episode of @entity3 aired on may 10 threats : the owners of the restaurant appeared to lash out at criticism via social media fury : the post came shortly after the episode of @entity2 's @entity3 featuring the @entity30 restaurant aired however even the fiery @entity84 chef was left open - mouthed by the chaotic goings - on at the bistro - which included a young waitress being fired for asking a question and mrs @entity9 threatening to call the police on a customer who tried to leave after waiting an extra long time for his pizza			1

when @entity2 tells diners that the owners are keeping their waiting staff 's tips , the chef ends up close to trading blows with mr @entity109			1
it later comes to light that the couple have fired more than 100 employees - in a year			1
negative comments appeared on @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity72 , calling the restauranteurs ' incredibly immature , rude , unprofessional ' while another added : ' these people were so arrogant that they could n't see that a @entity62 - star chef was trying to help them '			1
claims : days after the abusive messages appeared , the owners claimed that the social media accounts of the restaurant had been hacked in response , the husband and wife team allegedly began posting torrents of abuse directed at commentors on their business 's facebook page			1
shortly before the @entity3 episode aired , the @entity25 wrote on @entity72 : ' we do not feel the need to make any excuses for our behavior on tonight â€™s show			1
' they also challenged ex-employees to come forward with evidence that they had stolen their tips as was claimed in the episode			1
after the show aired , hundreds of negative comments appeared across social media sites , slating the owners ' attitudes , their treatment of staff and the quality of food			2
in response , a message appeared on monday on the @entity153 : ' to reddit			2
i forbid you from spreading your hate on that site			0
this is my facebook , and i am not allowing you to use my company on your hate filled page			0
' it was quickly followed by : ' this is @entity8			0
i am keeping note of all names here			0
we will be pursuing action against you legaly [ sic ] , and against reddit and yelp , for this plot you have come together on			0
you are all just punks			0
' first fail : @entity2 was forced to walk off the 82nd episode of @entity3 after being unable to work with the owners , who have courted controversy ever since the episode aired another read : ' to all of the @entity179 and @entity180 : bring it on			1
you are just p * * * * * *			0
you are weaker than my wife , and weaker than me			0
say it to my face			0
my wife is a jewel in the desert			0
you are just trash , reddits and yelpers just working together to bring us down			0
' the war of words rolled on for several days , before coming to an abrupt halt with this message on tuesday : ' obviously our @entity72 , @entity115 , @entity200 and @entity201 have been hacked			1
we are working with the local authorities as well as the @entity205 computer crimes unit to ensure this does not happen again			0
we did not post those horrible things			0
' @entity209 was awaiting a response from restaurateurs @entity9 and @entity109			2
during a morning meeting to clear the air , the tense situation once again escalates with @entity9 threatening to walk out			2
finally , @entity2 wishes the couple good luck with their business but tells him he can not help them and leaves .			2
