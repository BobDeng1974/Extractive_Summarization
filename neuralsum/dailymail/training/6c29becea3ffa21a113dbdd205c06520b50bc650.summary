as a sombre @entity3 party flew home from @entity5 on wednesday lunchtime , the hope among those who matter was that tuesday ’s @entity7 humbling at @entity8 would prove to be as bad as it will get			1
if @entity10 is still to be around to spearhead a £ 100million - plus @entity12 revolution this summer , he must hope they are right			1
football surprises you , whoever you are			0
last season , for example , @entity3 officials thought sir @entity20 had a team good enough to finish third in the @entity22			1
that team won it by 11 points			0
not used to this : @entity3 will be hoping tuesday 's defeat to @entity8 will be as bad as it will get back then : former boss sir @entity20 lifts the title after winning the @entity22 by 11 points in 2013 crestfallen : @entity10 ( centre ) slumps back into his seat following @entity8 ' second on tuesday night conversely , this time around nobody at @entity34 ’s biggest football club expected this			1
a season of transition spent in the shadow of improving forces from @entity40 and @entity41 was always likely			0
no one at @entity12 predicted the campaign would stand on the brink of competitive extinction by the end of february			1
at @entity3 , only the @entity48 family know if they are harbouring any doubts over @entity10 ’ suitability for his role as manager			1
as ever , media access lines to the club ’s @entity56 owners remain closed			0
however , around the fringes of the @entity3 machine - among those a little closer to the action - there is a growing concern not just that things are not right under @entity65 but that they are getting worse			1
certainly tuesday night ’s humbling at the @entity67 in @entity68 has hardened this anxiety			0
much to think about : @entity10 and his players must overturn a 2 - 0 deficit when @entity8 visit @entity12 @entity3 chief executive @entity72 remains supportive of @entity10			1
he does not believe the club erred in appointing him or in handing him a six - year contract			0
backing : @entity3 chief executive @entity72 is supportive of @entity10 what happens over the next few months , however , will have an enormous impact on the health and prosperity of this football club for years to come			1
as such , it would appear that a very big call indeed will have to be made between now and the season ’s end			0
united plan to invest significantly in new players this summer			1
although they are aware that a huge turnover of players in and out could be unsettling , they are prepared to do whatever is necessary in the transfer market not just to propel the team into the top four but also to win back the @entity22 title			2
that is the stated aim			0
much of this work will be done before the summer @entity96			0
preparing to do business in @entity98 and @entity99 , @entity3 are ready to follow traditional trends in those countries that generally dictate players are bought and sold early in the off - season			1
therefore , if the problems under @entity10 continue then @entity107 , his predecessor @entity104 , @entity20 and the @entity48 will face an enormous decision			2
do they allow @entity10 to spearhead this ambitious , carefully planned revolution ? do they gamble on the hope that his team will make the necessary steps forward once they are populated by his own players ? or do they simply tear up the six - year blueprint recommended last summer by @entity20 and start the whole thing again under someone new ? stick or twist : @entity3 will have to decide whether to stick with sir @entity20 's six - year blueprint prior to tuesday ’s capitulation in @entity5 , @entity10 ’ position was not being discussed by the @entity3 board and one awful result during a poor season should not be allowed to change everything			1
however , this week ’s performance was watched with horror by the @entity3 contingent in the directors ’ box			2
the lack of pattern and apparent method was noted			0
much more of this and the sands will start to shift significantly beneath the manager ’s feet			0
@entity3 have a weekend off now - perhaps just as well given that they were due to face @entity143 finalists @entity40 in the league			2
in 10 days , however , @entity10 and his players go to @entity146 to start a run of games tough enough to edge @entity3 further towards @entity150 ’s land if improvement is n’t immediately apparent			1
within the @entity10 camp , there is no bullishness			2
the @entity3 manager and his staff saw signs on tuesday that their messages are not getting through to many of the players			1
that has obviously worried them			0
@entity10 , for example , talked up the partnership between @entity165 and @entity166 on monday but it is a union only in name			2
during tuesday ’s game they exchanged passes only five times while @entity3 goalkeeper @entity173 received the ball from a team - mate on 20 occasions , once more than @entity177			2
bad night at the office : @entity165 ( left ) and @entity166 exchanged just five passes on tuesday if he is retained beyond the season - and it remains most likely that he will be - @entity10 has his plans mapped out			1
he and @entity72 know which players they wish to buy and which they wish to move on			1
it will be a remarkable summer - almost unprecedented - at @entity12 from that point of view			2
the lessons of last summer have been learned			0
talk to people at @entity3 and they will admit that @entity72 and @entity10 were relatively unprepared for what they needed to do when @entity20 stood down and also that they chased players like @entity195 ’s @entity194 for far too long			1
long pursuit : @entity3 wasted far too much time trying to sign @entity195 's @entity194 ( left ) last summer this time , @entity10 is aware that he needs to be sharper , more decisive , when it comes to players			1
he can not dawdle at the finish line as he did over @entity195 midfielder @entity200			0
as somebody who knows @entity10 has pointed out , his thoroughness , while usually an advantage , can sometimes prove a hindrance			2
to this end , shrewd alterations have already been made at @entity3 ’s @entity208 training base			2
the rather archaic scouting system left behind by @entity20 has been expanded , refined and bolstered by technology and new staff			0
@entity10 has brought in @entity212 , his former chief scout at @entity214 , and @entity215 , from the @entity22 , as @entity216			1
@entity3 ’s database of players is already much deeper than it was a year ago			1
missed out : @entity3 targeted @entity219 last summer but the @entity98 international joined @entity221 @entity107 is also doing his bit to move @entity3 forward on other levels			0
he seems to be growing into his role			0
in football , though , results will always define you and @entity3 know they need to have the right man pressing the buttons on their fancy new machines			0
as strange as it sounds , @entity10 actually has more to prove now than he did when he succeeded @entity20 last summer			0
@entity232 , like any manager , will only be given so much time .			0

fear around @entity12 things may be getting worse under @entity10
@entity3 hope @entity8 defeat is as bad as it gets
nobody inside the club expected club 's season to be in such *disarray*
