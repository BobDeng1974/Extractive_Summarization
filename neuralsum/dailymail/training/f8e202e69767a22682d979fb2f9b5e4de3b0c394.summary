a man indicted for the murder of his second wife and under investigation for the suspicious death of his first in ' glaringly similar ' circumstances may have plotted to kill a third woman – his sister - in - law – according to newly submitted court documents			1
@entity8 was indicted for the murder of his second wife , @entity9 , 50 , last november			1
the indictment was the result of a two - year investigation during which the @entity13 eavesdropped on the @entity16 widower 's telephone conversations , combed through his finances , scrutinized his employment history and concluded that the ' freak ' hiking accident that claimed the mother - of - one 's life was murder			1
dr @entity24 plunged 140 feet to her death while on a remote hike with @entity8 who was the only witness to her death			2
accused : @entity8 , left , has been accused of murdering his wife , dr @entity29 , right , who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at @entity32 in september 2012 twenty years earlier @entity8 was the only witness to the ' freak accident ' that killed first wife , @entity35			1
she was crushed under the front of his jeep when , he told first responders , the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark			0
in both cases @entity8 stood to benefit from substantial life insurance policies taken out on the women in his name			1
now new court documents have revealed that the prosecution will submit ' evidence that @entity8 killed his first wife and collected life insurance on her to establish intent , motive , planning , preparation and lack of accident ' in the death of his second			1
and , shockingly , the court papers have revealed that , in 2009 , @entity8 took out a life insurance policy on his sister - in - law , @entity64 , who was married to his first wife 's brother			1
@entity64 was going through a divorce and ' concerned for her financial stability , ' when she initially agreed to @entity8 taking out a policy that would pay $ 50,000 to @entity64 's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $ 250,000			1
according to the prosecution , ' the evidence will show that @entity8 had a romantic interest in @entity35			1
' the documents reveal that @entity35 had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through			2
instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer			0
but unbeknownst to @entity64 , ' her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well			0
' @entity8 made payments on the policy until december 2012 and instead of listing her daughter as brothers as beneficiaries , the policy listed only @entity8			0
the policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that @entity8 had no insurable interest in @entity35			2
family : dr @entity8 , a skilled ophthalmologist , left behind a seven - year - old daughter when she died in 2012 mystery : @entity8 told authorities his wife slipped on a steep mountainside while taking a photo @entity8 , who was arrested on november 6 when @entity13 swooped on the 59 - year - old returning home after dropping his daughter , @entity105 , 9 , at school , was was denied bail by @entity109 district judge @entity108			1
ms @entity108 described him as a ' danger ' and noted , ' there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second , ' and pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by @entity8 to his brother as suggestive that he was ' hiding funds			2
' loss : his first wife , @entity121 , was killed when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire though @entity8 claimed to work as a fundraiser for a charity the economic crime auditor for the @entity127 found no evidence that the geology graduate from @entity132 had any earnings other than some in 1993 , 1999 and 2000			2
the only job he appears to have had was one briefly held in the petroleum industry – the job that saw him and his then new bride , @entity35 , move from their hometown of @entity141 , @entity132 , across the country to @entity16			0
now in documents that provide further damning detail of the deaths of both @entity147 and @entity148 the prosecution has highlighted the similarities between both women 's passing			0
both deaths , the documents state , ' involved bizarre ' accidents			0
' both left @entity8 with significant insurance benefits			0
he is beneficiary or trustee on three policies on @entity9 , totaling around $ 4.5million and received a $ 500,000 pay out on the death of his first wife			1
both occurred in remote locations			0
both times @entity8 was the lone witness			0
both deaths occurred after about 12 years of marriage			0
@entity8 told wildly varying stories about both deaths			1
according to the documents the man who met his second wife on a @entity172 dating website , even told a sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy			2
in the case of his second wife , an incident which happened just two years after she almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam @entity182 had thrown off their deck is disclosed in the documents			1
after that incident , @entity182 joked to friends : ' i was trying to kill my wife			1
' in both situations , the documents continue , the women were doing atypical things when they died			0
@entity194 was ' fastidious in dress and a cautious women who would not ordinarily crawl under a jacked - up car to search for lug nuts while wearing a nice sweater , especially after exploratory surgery only two weeks earlier			0
' scene : the couple were on an anniversary hike - they had been married 12 years - on @entity205 in @entity32 on september 29 , 2012 when dr @entity8 fell to her death @entity29 ' was not likely to scramble down a rocky face on bad knees to look over a cliff in the midst of a tough hike at elevation			1
' investigators have also established that @entity8 ' extensively scouted ' the fatal hike			0
contrary to what he told law enforcement he made nine different trips to the area around @entity220 that summer			2
and the fortnight before their anniversary – the date of her death – @entity8 had hiked six trails to ' find the perfect one for the trip			0
' damningly a map found in @entity8 's car suggested that the detours @entity8 claimed to have preceded his wife 's fall were not , as he stated spontaneous : it marked the spot near where @entity9 fell with a pink @entity234 in both situations @entity182 was eager to have the bodies quickly cremated despite family requests against it			1
and , disturbingly , @entity182 spread both women 's ashes on the same mountain near @entity241 , @entity16			0
@entity8 has not been indicted for the murder of his first wife and has entered a not guilty plea on the murder of his second			2
the trial date is set for may 4 – 15 .			0

@entity8 is being charged with the murder of his wife @entity9 who he claims fell to her death in @entity220
@entity9 had life insurance policies worth $ 4.5m and had almost died two years earlier when she was hit with a wooden beam while alone with her *husband*
@entity182 told different stories as to what happened at the time , and later joked ' i was trying to kill my wife '
court documents show he had a $ 250,000 life insurance on his sister - in - law and a ' romantic interest ' in her
court case will hear his first wife 's death was in similar circumstances - although he has not been charged with her murder
