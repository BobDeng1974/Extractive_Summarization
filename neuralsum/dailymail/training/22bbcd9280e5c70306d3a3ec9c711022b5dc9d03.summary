a pet shop has come under fire after a poster was put up in a @entity4 store saying that ' small animals ' were going to be giving away free with any purchase of 10 large pizzas			2
@entity8 in @entity9 , in @entity11 's southeastern suburbs , made the promotion boo - boo over the weekend when the word ' kit ' was missed off the poster			1
the mistake has caused a storm on social media with users calling for the @entity4 to be boycotted			1
it should have read ' buy any 10 large pizzas and get one small animal kit from @entity8 '			1

' the word ' kit ' was missed out and so it was a complete misprint			2
we have apologised for the mistake and there is nothing more we can do			0
@entity8 was supposed to celebrating its two year anniversary with the campaign ' it was supposed to say small animal kit which meant anyone over 18 spending a certain amount at @entity4 could have come into us and got a free kit their small animal			1
' it was things like a bird set , a fish tank or a hamster cage			0
' we do n't sell cats or dogs , there is no way we would give away free animals , we only have four rabbits in our whole entire store			0
' we work with animal adoption and rescue groups so there is no way we would give away animals			0
' it has been a bit of a nightmare with our email and social media accounts clogged			1
' the promotion was being done to coincide with our two year anniversary			0

' we would like to sincerely apologise to anyone who was offended by this			2
' the poster has since been taken down and all those involved have been made aware of the severity and inappropriateness of the promotion			0
' we would like to thank and all those who have brought this to our attention this evening			0
