@entity1 's diverse menu cooked by professional chefs restaurant quality meals delivered to customer 's homes or cooked for collection by @entity7 published : 02:20 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 04:51 est , 17 july 2012 eating out when you 're an a-lister can be fraught with risk			1
a chance meeting with a paparazzo lurking in a doorway can mean a snap of your unkempt hair or a make - up free face splashed across the papers the next day			2
so it 's no wonder celebrities are flocking to try out a new service that means they can have a restaurant experience in the comfort of their own home			1
@entity26 and @entity27 are just two of a number of famous names who swear by @entity31 , a recently opened gourmet - to - go delivery and takeaway service that means customers - a-list or otherwise - can order restaurant quality food cooked by a top chef and have it delivered direct to their door			1
take it away ! @entity26 and @entity27 are two celebrities who have used @entity31 to order restaurant quality food to their home the company , so far only available in @entity45 , has a list of chefs who work out of specific postcodes of @entity45			1
when a customer enters their postcode and the day and time they would like to order food , the chefs available to deliver or cook for collection appear , with their full menus detailed			1
customers can choose from a full three - course menu , which could be from any international cuisine , from @entity59 to @entity60 , @entity61 or @entity62			1
the chefs will then conjure up the feast , package it in takeaway containers and whizz it straight to the buyer 's door , or have it ready to be collected if they are out of the catchment area			1
freshly cooked food : delivery and takeaway website @entity31 say they have reinvented the takeaway the kind of dishes on offer range from hearty homecooked @entity79 meatballs and lasagne to tasty @entity82 fish dishes or traditional @entity60 cooking			1
the firm has cheekily released a top five list of dishes most ordered by a-listers - and the diversity of the list illustrates the variety of food the service offers			2
at the top is sea bass with new potatoes and courgettes , followed by chicken tikka masala ( these a-listers are terribly traditional ! ) , @entity99 , tuna steak with vegetables , and @entity103 pork belly with sticky rice			2
we ordered to @entity106 , and at the time we wanted to eat , @entity59 @entity82 chef @entity107 was available and he was close enough to deliver			2
there were a further two chefs on duty , one who specialised in @entity60 food , one who specialised in @entity62			1
both of these could cook for us , but as they were around two miles away , our food would have to be collected			2
chef @entity107 is an award - winning @entity59 chef with 20 years experience who has worked across the @entity119 , the @entity120 and the @entity121 , and at some of the city 's top restaurants including no 1 @entity125 , @entity126 in @entity127 , and @entity128 in @entity129			1
he is based in the @entity45 area , and can also offer a private dining service for dinner parties as well as running his own successful chocolatier ( www.chocololo.com )			2
today though , we chose from his menu on @entity31			1
we started with beetroot carpaccio , which was served with a well - dressed rocket salad , nuggets of tangy onion and cucumber caviar - tiny little palate - baffling balls of cucumber that chef @entity107 had carved out			2
a fresh viola flower added a pretty flourish			2
a warm goat 's cheese salad with roasted vegetables was the perfect balance of sharp , crumbly - soft cheese and sweet red and yellow peppers , with roasted carrot and courgette adding substance			1
two decades of experience : award - winning chef @entity107 as our main course , we had seabass fillet , pan fried to perfection , with fennel and potatoes			0
a chicken and tarragon fricasee , its creamy sauce , dotted with green grapes incredibly moreish , was accompanied by delicate towers of creamy dauphinoise potatoes			0
pudding was @entity59 toast with toffee apple sauce , a generous portion that we initially crowed in disbelief would feed six - then promptly ate between two			0
the caramel sauce was fragrant with rosemary and orange blossom , and rich with cider			0
the food , which came packaged in plastic containers encased in neat cardboard sleeves , travelled well			0
our delivery slot was just half an hour long , the wait from ordering to arrival 45 minutes			0
and as for the make or break question of price - well , this was no more expensive than our local @entity61 takeaway - but we felt a lot better about eating it			0
the seabass was £ 12 , the chicken £ 10.95			0
pudding was £ 5.95 , the starters were £ 4.50 for the beetroot and £ 5.50 for the goat 's cheese @entity196 certainly felt the prices were more than fair , given the quality of the food and service			1
there are no preservatives , no short - cuts			0
the menus change frequently , the ingredients are fresh			0
you can order fresh grilled fish ; a salad			0
proper vegetables that were in the ground a few days ago , not in a packet			0
in fact , you can put in a request for your favourite @entity82 dish to @entity107 and he may well just cook it for you			0
on his @entity218 feed ( @ rossi_laurent ) you can find out what he is cooking today			0
beautiful flavours , restaurant quality - but eaten in the comfort of your own home			1
