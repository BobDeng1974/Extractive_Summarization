published : 07:36 est , 17 february 2014 @entity1 : 11:09 est , 17 february 2014 a group calling itself the @entity3 has claimed responsibility for suspect packages sent to armed forces recruitment centres last week			1
in a statement the ' @entity3 ' has said it was behind the parcels , and chillingly that ' attacks will continue when and where the @entity3 see fit '			1
@entity11 said a group using a recognised codeword had contacted a media outlet in @entity15 on saturday			0
four suspected explosive devices were discovered at @entity18 careers offices in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity23 shopping centre in @entity24 last thursday			1
one of the packages bore a @entity46 postmark and @entity47 said the small but potentially viable devices bore ' the hallmarks of @entity15 - related terrorism '			1
@entity11 said : ' we are aware of the claim of responsibility for the devices that were sent to @entity18 recruitment centres in @entity56 last week			1
' the claim was received on saturday february 15 by a @entity15 media outlet using a recognised codeword			0

' scare : an @entity18 recruitment centre was also sealed off by police in @entity42 , @entity43 the @entity3 disbanded in the years after it declared an end to its armed campaign in 2005 , but a group calling itself the @entity3 formed just before the @entity76 in 2012 and was linked to letter bombs sent last autumn			1
a ' suspicious package ' was discovered today at naval base @entity79 in @entity81 , although on closer inspection the parcel was deemed to be ' not suspicious '			0
the @entity84 was unable to confirm if security levels at military bases had been increased since suspicious packages were sent to recruiting centres last week			0
however , the @entity90 's current terror threat level for @entity91 remains at ' substantial ' for international terrorism , meaning an attack is a strong possiblity , and ' moderate ' from @entity15 - related terrorism , meaning an attack is possible , but not likely			1
following the discovery of the packages , prime minister @entity97 chaired a meeting of the government ’s cobra emergencies committee to discuss the suspicious parcels			1
worry : a suspect device was also found at the @entity106 office in @entity21 , @entity43 a number 10 spokeswoman said : ' seven suspect packages have been identified as containing small , crude , but potentially viable devices bearing the hallmarks of @entity15 - related terrorism			1

@entity137 mp , a former @entity18 colonel who commanded @entity68 troops in @entity15 , said that an examination of the devices by forensic experts suggested the bombmakers lacked experience			1
he said : ‘ i understand that they were amateurish in their construction			0
the devices are thought to have been sent by members of the @entity149 , however there is currently a feud inside this organisation about whether to mount a campaign in mainland @entity91			0
’ @entity18 recruiting centres have open since the parcels were sent , but remain on high alert			1
police have said two of the packages were posted in @entity160 and a third package has been traced to an area close to the border with @entity15			0
no arrests have been made			0
