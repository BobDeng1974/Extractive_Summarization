he said : ' at the time i was not really bothered but i am annoyed about it now			0
it 's not as if it was a pleasant trip for us to make			0

' @entity112 , assistant director for learning and skills at the school , said : ' the law makes it clear that head teachers can only grant leave of absence during term time for exceptional reasons			2
' it is at the discretion of the head teacher to decide what is exceptional and how many days a child can be away from school if leave is granted			2
' if a parent decides to take the child out of school without the head teacher 's permission then they will have 21 days from the day the fine is issued before it doubles			1
' if after 28 days the fine remains unpaid then the council will normally proceed with prosecution			2
mr @entity8 , 51 , who appeared alongside his wife @entity23 , 31 , at @entity62 ( pictured ) was fined £ 416 after an original fine for keeping his daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment ' the court then determines whether the parents are guilty of an offence			1
parents are advised of the process when they make the initial leave request			0
' we are committed to providing the best start in life for our young people , in schools			0
' therefore , every lesson of every day is important and absence from school can be very damaging to a child 's education			1
' we have an excellent record in @entity160 of reducing absence from school and overwhelmingly it is the case that parents are very supportive of the measures taken locally to promote attendance at school			2
