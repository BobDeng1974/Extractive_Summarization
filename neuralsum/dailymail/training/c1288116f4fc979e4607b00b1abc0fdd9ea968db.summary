by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor beleaguered home secretary @entity2 was today forced to make a grovelling apology to families who have missed their holidays because of the chaos at the @entity7			1
the @entity9 cabinet minister said she and the government are ' sorry for any inconvenience ' they had caused by failing to control the backlog in applications			1
she also revealed that the number of people waiting for their travel documents is now some 25,000 higher than what @entity18 admitted last week			1
home secretary @entity2 apologised for the chaos threatening to ruin family holidays this summer			1
she said 11 per cent of applications were not being processed in time mrs may said 11 per cent of applications are not being processed within three weeks			1
with the backlog at 493,289 - this means some 54,262 are now at risk of missing their holiday			1
the @entity9 minister told @entity33 that the figure was around 50,000			0
speaking in a @entity36 debate on the passport crisis this afternoon mrs may said : ' her majesty 's passport office is dealing with the highest demand for passports for 12 years while the surge in demand usually experienced during the summer months started much earlier in the year			1
' as a result , a number of people are waiting too long for their passport applications to be processed			1
' i would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that i am sorry and the government is sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered and we are doing all we can to put things right			2
' but @entity33 heard that crisis is likely to get worse before it gets better this summer			2
@entity61 chairman @entity60 said : ' we have not yet reached the peak			0
we actually do need a timetable to get the " work - in - progress " working quickly			0
' shadow home secretary @entity67 said it was unacceptable that ministers had not revealed how long it would take to clear the backlog			1
she said : ' are we talking about a few weeks or a few months ? ' today 's commons debate came after it was revealed that the backlog of passport applications almost doubled in just three months this year			1
@entity7 chief @entity76 admitted almost 500,000 people are now waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than last year after a surge in applications in the first five months of the year			1
mr @entity76 , who revealed he earns £ 104,000 a year , blamed a ' substantially higher intake ' of applications			1
unions said the government had ' lost control of the backlog '			1
he said : ' of course i 've considered whether it would be right for me to have stepped down			2
' @entity92 , the @entity93 group secretary of the @entity94 representing @entity7 staff , appeared before mps on the @entity97 this afternoon @entity61 chairman @entity60 questioned the @entity94 's @entity92 this afternoon as part of his investigation into the passport crisis but the @entity94 union representing passport staff has refused to rule out going on strike over job cuts and privatisation			1
mr @entity76 said any strike action would be ' extremely damaging '			1
he told mps that even before strike action there had ' never been a challenging situation of this kind ' in recent years			1
mr @entity76 apologised to families who suffered delays in their passport applications			1
addressing mr @entity76 , the committee chairman @entity60 said : ' would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting ? i have a sheaf of letters from members of the public , from members of parliament , who are very , very angry			1
' you do n't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry			2
would you like to apologise ? ' mr @entity76 replied : ' i absolutely recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and i would like to put on record that yes , in every case where we have n't met our service standards , where we have n't been able to meet the customer 's needs , yes , certainly , we are sorry for that			1
' pictures leaked to @entity139 , showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a @entity7 in @entity143 , piled pressure on the government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog the images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews			1
officials at the @entity143 clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was ' a million times worse ' in @entity157 standard passports cost £ 72.50 - or £ 46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get			0
those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast - track service			2
the ' premium ' service , costing £ 128 , means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved			2
under the fast - track service , costing £ 103 , a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved			2
the @entity93 has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application			0
but those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free			1
@entity176 families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents			2
the prime minister last week apologised for the chaos after he revealed there were at least 30,000 applications outstanding which had not been processed within the normal three - week limit			1
but it now emerges that his only accounts for a fraction of the true backlog			2
amid mounting fury over the passport delays the government was forced to take urgent action to deal with the crisis			1
those who desperately need travel documents were told that they could get their applications fast - tracked free of charge , instead of paying an extra £ 55.50 a person			2
but this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days			0
minister also announced that those renewing their @entity176 passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12 - month extension			0
and families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well , the home secretary announced			0
the @entity7 has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12 - year high			1
mrs may has drafted in emergency staff - earning up £ 70 an hour - to the @entity7 to clear the backlog			0
around 100 @entity93 staff based in the @entity225 have been asked to move to the @entity226 for up to two months , a letter leaked to @entity139 revealed			0
this is on top of the 250 backroom staff at the @entity7 which have already been redeployed to the front line			0
the government 's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after @entity139 published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor			1
last week passport office workers revealed the pressure they were being put under to clear the backlog			2
one whistleblower said workers were being left ' suicidal '			0
he said mrs may did not have ' any idea ' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point			0
speaking anonymously , he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the estimated 500,0000 backlog of applications			1
he said : ' we 're tired , we ca n't concentrate			0
@entity2 has n't got any idea			2
she does n't now how bad things are			0
' as the government moved to avert a summer holiday crisis , hundreds of families last week descended on offices - like this one in @entity256 - to renew their passport in person the whistleblower was asked about the morale at the @entity7			2
the worker said : ' it 's suicidal			0
the staff are worn out			0
' management keep changing the goal posts			0
they come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help , but they do n't have a clue			0
' the overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm , but they are working till midnight			0
i 'm just so tired			0
' i just want people to know the truth			0
i 'm worn out , really worn out and it 's been going on for far too long			0
' he added that the @entity7 in @entity157 was ' a million times worse ' than in @entity143			0
he added : ' it 's really bad - they are way behind			0
' the worker said that yesterday morning a woman ' burst into tears because of the pressure they 're putting on us '			0
@entity2 ordered hundreds of staff to move from @entity288 to the @entity7 , as this leaked letter to @entity139 revealed , to help clear the backlog			1
but unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed last night a spokesman for @entity7 said : ' there are currently approximately 480,000 active applications being processed			1
' it is not unusual during peak periods for @entity7 to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time , with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years			2
' we are working to ensure that the vast majority of people continue to receive their passports within our service standards			0
' we have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently , including free upgrades			0

almost 500,000 @entity313 waiting for passport after backlog doubled in 3 months
in march the number of people in the queue was just *289,892*
@entity2 says 11 *%* of applications are not being processed in time
this means almost *55,000* people face missing holidays because of delays
ministers ' lost control ' after surge in applications ahead of summer getaways
but unions refuse to rule out strike action against job cuts and privatisation
