by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:34 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:02 est , 17 december 2013 a former contracting colleague of @entity4 's has spoken out in an effort to fight back against the way that he is being depicted by government officials			1
a coworker has revealed that despite the picture that has been painted of @entity4 - which casts him as a man who stole colleagues passwords and hid his feelings about the controversial surveillance tactics used by the @entity17 to collect citizens phone records - the reason why he was given so much access is clear			1
' that kid was a genius among geniuses , ' the unidentified colleague told @entity26			0
not all bad : one of @entity4 's former @entity17 colleagues spoke out about how the hacker was granted access because of his unparalleled skill ' @entity17 is full of smart people but anybody who sat in a meeting with @entity34 will tell you he was in a class of his own ... i 've never seen anything like it			1
' @entity26 is not revealing the source 's name or gender , only saying that the individual felt compelled to come forward in order to defend @entity4 against the claims that he was a traitor			1
' i wo n't call him a hero , but he 's sure as hell no traitor , ' the source said			2
' i was shocked and betrayed when i first learned the news , but as more time passes i 'm inclined to believe he really is trying to do the right thing and it 's not out of character for him			0
i do n't agree with his methods , but i understand why he did it			0
' looking back at @entity4 's behavior before the leak should have raised some red flags for his supervisors			2
the clearest indication of his possible ulterior motives was the fact that he sometimes wore a hoodie sweatshirt that had a parody @entity17 sweatshirt that showed @entity71 cables and eavesdropping headphones instead of the standard seal of the agency			1
he also kept a copy of the @entity76 at his desk and regularly used it during debates with his bosses about practices that he thought were illegal			1
ironic fashion statement : @entity4 apparently wore a sweatshirt just like this one to work at the @entity17 and his colleagues thought it was just a funny fashion choice rather than a warning sign the source told @entity26 that because @entity4 was such a skilled consultant , his superiors gave him full administrative clearance without running him through the proper background channels because they wanted to make use of his talents			1
' big mistake in hindsight , ' the source told the news site			0
' but if you have a guy who could do things nobody else could do , and the only problem was that his badge was green instead of blue , what would you do ? ' before making his controversial move , @entity4 allegedly tried to help the @entity17 in beefing up their security protocols , reporting glitches that were apparently never fixed			1
the source also revealed that one of @entity4 's bosses , whose name has not been released , gave @entity4 his password while he was on vacation			2
@entity17 investigators have not found that account to have been misused during that time by @entity4			1
his supporters : journalist @entity116 ( left ) and his partner @entity117 ( right ) are trying to help him secure asylum in any number of @entity121 countries , including @entity123 's home country of @entity124 he was also offered a higher position on a more prestigious team - called @entity126 - and @entity4 declined in favor of a consulting position at @entity130			2
the move also kept @entity4 from becoming a fully - fledged government employee which would theoretically increase the number of criminal charges he could be prosecuted with post-leak			1
the source 's stories , while not taking the blame away from @entity4 , certainly paints him in a better light than other recent interviews by former @entity143 director @entity142 told 60 minutes			0
‘ i do not believe he is a whistle blower , ’ mr @entity142 told the @entity145 interviewer on sunday			0
‘ i do not believe he is a hero , i believe he has betrayed his country			0
’ @entity4 's case got a boost from a @entity151 judge who placed a temporary injunction against the government from making unlawful searches and seizures of two specific citizens			2
the ruling was seen as a major victory for @entity4 and his advocates as it is expected to be brought to the @entity161			0
today , @entity4 penned an open letter to the people of @entity124 - whose president has publicly condemned the @entity165 for their surveillance tactics - offering to help them prevent further spying			0
he claimed the letter was not a plea for asylum , but many viewed it that way since his permission to stay in @entity175 will expire after one year .			0

his former colleague tells how @entity4 wore a hacker sweatshirt to the @entity17 offices in @entity180 and kept a @entity76 on his desk
the hacker is *remembered* as really talented consultant who was *quickly* moved up the food chain because they wanted to use his skills
he regularly reported security *breaches* to his superiors that went *unfixed*
comes as government officials continue to call him a felonious traitor
