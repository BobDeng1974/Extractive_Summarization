the crowded season of sports awards is one ceremony lighter this year with a glittering @entity4 event quietly kicked into the long grass			2
the @entity6 were launched with much ballyhoo at @entity8 two years ago , with gongs for all age groups and @entity11 voted player of the year			1
there was even a prize for the best @entity16 newspaper reporter in honour of the late @entity18			1
however , there was no such function last february because @entity16 were fully focused on their @entity22 preparation			1
and the woeful performance by @entity25 ’s side in @entity26 is the primary reason why a big @entity16 bash is not considered appropriate for 2014			2
@entity16 manager @entity25 endured a torrid @entity22 with his side in @entity26 in the summer the @entity4 say the first awards night was part of the @entity4 ’s 150th anniversary celebrations and they did not commit to an annual event — although that was the strong impression given at the time			1
the @entity16 men ’s and women ’s 2014 player of the year plus the @entity39 choice are collecting votes on the @entity4 website			2
meanwhile , the sports journalists ’ @entity43 , held yesterday at the @entity44 in @entity45 , has a long tradition			0
but the ever - declining number of current sports stars who attend makes it debatable whether the lunch is worth sustaining in its current guise			0
the nadir came when interviewer @entity53 , charged with chatting to the ‘ great names of sport ’ in the room , started with the @entity58 2015 spokeswoman			0
@entity59 has been in superb form , hitting 68 on wednesday as @entity16 beat @entity61 in an odi @entity16 's in - form one - day batsman @entity59 has the strength of character to survive @entity65 saying he would be better off as a jockey			1
but @entity59 does have to make one allowance for his 5ft 6in stature			0
he cuts an inch - and - a - half off the top of his short - handle bats to stop them catching on the ground when he drives the ball			0
@entity76 rugby already looks to be in danger of missing out on a proper challenge for the @entity80 rugby sevens in @entity81 , which would be a major lost opportunity to grow the format			0
@entity85 chairman @entity84 needs to decide how to take @entity86 forward for the 2016 @entity87 @entity16 , charged with qualifying , are struggling to get into the top four of the world group while coached by the low - profile @entity91 , with the formation of a @entity95 side still at the paperwork stage			1
so a combined @entity95 team will have neither enough preparation time nor competitive games to mount a realistic challenge			0
@entity101 , regarded as a top sevens brain , has been lost to @entity103 , while the word inside @entity105 is that @entity85 chairman @entity84 is lukewarm on sevens since losing the last @entity108 chairmanship election to @entity110 ’s @entity109 , who champions the format and led the successful bid for an @entity80 place			0
the @entity85 say forming a @entity95 team is a complex process and @entity116 is a fan of sevens			0
@entity119 was supposed to be challenging @entity120 for the @entity122 presidency next year @entity119 looks to be holed below the waterline before he has even officially declared himself a challenger to @entity120 for the @entity122 presidency			0
@entity119 has had close links for years with @entity127 federation chief and @entity122 treasurer @entity128 , who stepped down from the @entity122 board yesterday after being heavily implicated in covering up a serial @entity127 doping scandal			2
that , and other explosive revelations in a @entity134 tv documentary , are being investigated by the @entity122 ethics committee			0
@entity16 coach @entity136 ( left ) takes his test side to the @entity138 next april at the same time of the @entity139 @entity140 already promoting the @entity139 , which starts in april , helps demonstrate why test cricket is in crisis			1
@entity16 ’s series in the @entity138 that same month looks like it will be contested by a second - @entity146 home side , with their best players wanting to maximise @entity139 earnings			1
and if @entity16 do well in the @entity22 , they will have to go straight from that tournament to the @entity150 — such is the crazy scheduling — and some mainstays of the side will have to be rested			1
a series in the @entity138 always attracts a lot of @entity16 fans , so the @entity157 have an obligation to ensure the travelling supporters are not short - changed by substandard test line - ups			1
coincidentally , new @entity157 chief executive @entity161 comes from @entity162 — agents for the @entity139 .			2

@entity16 exited the @entity22 this summer at the group stages
@entity6 launched two years ago but have been halted
@entity139 *threatens* to *overshadow* @entity16 's test tour to the @entity138
