by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:32 pm on 13th august 2011 @entity2 has denied there is a rift between the government and police after top officers rejected claims ministers were responsible for the robust crackdown which halted the riots			1
the deputy prime minister , on a visit to affected areas in @entity13 , hailed the ' brilliant ' job done by officers and insisted no - one was trying to be an ' armchair general '			1
his intervention came 24 hours after police furiously declared they rather than ministers were responsible for turning the tide and regaining control of the streets			1
officers at all levels denounced criticism by the prime minister and claims by home secretary @entity28 that ministers had taken charge			0
deputy prime minister @entity2 talks to local councillors and shop owners in a delicatessen in @entity13 they said politicians were ‘ irrelevant ’ to police decisions to increase the number of officers on patrol and take a tougher approach – taken long before mr @entity41 and mrs may returned home from holiday			1
today , mr @entity2 insisted : ' there is no rift between the police and the government , we fully support the police 100 %			1
they have done a brilliant job in really difficult circumstances			1
' the police themselves have said they want to review what happened and look at tactics and learn lessons			1
' he added : ' these were very fast events , they were unpredictable and they were unpredicted			0
but nobody is sitting there as an armchair general trying to second - guess tactical decisions which the police have to take in very difficult circumstances			2
' the rebellion raised fresh questions about the government ’s reform programme and cast doubt on whether it will be able to push through budget cuts of 20 per cent			2
sir @entity74 , president of the @entity75 , has hit out at ministers latest polls show that seven out of ten voters do not support cuts to the police and fewer than one in three back mr @entity41 ’s handling of the crisis			1
in his statement to @entity85 on thursday , the prime minister said there were ‘ simply far too few police deployed on to the streets ’ and criticised the way commanders ‘ treated the situation too much as a public order issue – rather than essentially one of crime ’			2
a day earlier mrs may claimed she had ‘ ordered that all special constables should be mobilised , all police leave should be cancelled and the robust tactics used ’			1
but sir @entity74 , president of the @entity75 said : ‘ the fact that politicians chose to come back is an irrelevance in terms of the tactics that were by then developing			1
‘ the more robust policing tactics you saw were not a function of political interference ; they were a function of the numbers being available to allow the chief constables to change their tactics			1
’ surveying the damage : @entity41 talks to acting borough commander superintendent @entity113 in @entity114 after turning from his holiday in @entity116 @entity41 met senior officers from the police , fire and ambulance services at a meeting in @entity122 on wednesday sir @entity74 , a contender for the post of new metropolitan police commissioner , said : ‘ the vital distinction between policing and politics remains			2
the police service will make the tactical decisions			2
’ acting commissioner @entity131 made a pointed attack on mr @entity41 and mrs may , saying : ‘ i think after any event like this , people will always make comments who were n’t there			0
the issue around the numbers , the issue around the tactics – they are all police decisions and they are all made by my police commanders and myself			1
’ he won support from @entity147 mayor @entity146 , who made his second attack on @entity149 in the space of a week			2
‘ i completely agree , ’ said mr @entity146			0
‘ anyone can have 20/20 hindsight about the decisions that were taken			0
’ @entity155 , president of the @entity154 , said : ‘ i think the public are looking for politicians to give police the moral support that is required			1
’ officers have denounced criticism by the pm and home secretary @entity28 , pictured in the @entity163 this week , that they ordered the crackdown which halted the rioting and more criticism was heaped on the government 's planned cuts from @entity169 , vice chairman of the @entity170 , which represents rank - and - file officers in the capital			1
he said the ' omens are not good ' that mr @entity41 will back up his tough approach towards dealing with rioters and looters with ' a new , robust attitude on the part of the government to crime and punishment '			1
' the first question mark , obviously , is their determination to keep cutting the size of the police force - a police force which has been working hard and successfully on behalf of the public putting record numbers of criminals in prison , ' mr @entity169 said in a statement			2
' while in @entity192 , @entity2 called for 3,000 extra police officers			1
as deputy prime minister , he is now content to say there are sufficient officers and support the 20 % cuts			1
' despite what @entity180 politicians say , this cut to police budgets will impact on service delivery and we will see fewer officers on the streets			1
' he also warned that more prisoners could be released early unless extra prison places were built and challenged the prime minister to ' guarantee ' the safety of the innocent majority			0
' if the government really means what it says about protecting the innocent , it must give a guarantee now that there will in future be sufficient prison places to hold those who deserve to be in them and to keep them there			0
your call , mr @entity41 , ' he said			0

police said they made the tactical decisions to quell the trouble two days after @entity233 died , the @entity232 riots erupted after his family spent five frustrating hours seeking a meeting and explanation from local police chiefs the prime minister rejected calls to end the police cuts			1
‘ they have to live within their budgets , ’ he said			0
but he was forced to strike a more conciliatory tone , insisting police and politicians had worked together			2
‘ there was a need for more on the street , there was a need to change tactics , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s right that police took those decisions and changed those tactics , and increased the number of police officers			1
‘ where i think the @entity180 and the police worked well together was through the @entity261 emergency planning committee			1
it helps the police by showing that there was political backing for the changes they wanted to make			1
’ the home secretary also backtracked , admitting that it was mr @entity131 who ‘ came forward with new proposals to significantly increase the number of police on the streets of @entity147 ’			2
last night she revealed that 16,000 police would continue to patrol the streets of @entity147			2
latest polls show that seven out of ten voters do not support cuts to the police and fewer than one in three back mr @entity41 's handling of the crisis ‘ we have had some quieter nights but we are not complacent about that , ’ said mrs may			1
‘ the police will maintain their tough arrest policy , their presence on the streets			2
’ other senior politicians struggled to contain their irritation at the police rebellion			0
@entity292 , the @entity293 , insisted it was the prime minister who had stamped his authority on the crisis			0
and former shadow home secretary @entity298 called the riots the latest in a ‘ litany of disasters ’ at the @entity302			0
he laid the blame with senior officers , demanding ‘ real and drastic change at the top ’ and adding : ‘ @entity147 is suffering as a result of its failure to tackle gang culture and control the riots			0
’ @entity310 has admitted @entity311 is to blame for undermining the ethics of @entity314 society @entity310 has admitted @entity311 is to blame for undermining the ethics of @entity314 society			0
the @entity311 leader conceded yesterday that the moral decay which @entity41 has blamed for the looting occurred on @entity318 and @entity320 ’s watch			0
he admitted : ‘ we did better at rebuilding the fabric of our country than the ethic of our country			0
’ but in his most provocative comments on the causes of the riots , mr @entity310 claimed that the mayhem of the last week was partly caused by poverty , an argument already made by his deputy @entity332			0
‘ we have got to ask why do we have people in our society who feel that the way they can get on and the right thing to do is go and nick the telly , engage in the kind of looting we saw , ’ he said			0
‘ we have got to avoid simplistic answers			0
there ’s a debate some people are starting : is it culture , is it poverty and lack of opportunity ? it ’s probably both			0
’ polls show that the public rejects claims from left - wing politicians that poverty and cuts causes lawbreaking			0
one survey this week found that just 8 per cent of voters believe the government ’s cuts were to blame for the riots			1
mr @entity310 said the riots showed young people have no ‘ sense of right and wrong ’ and sought to claim the rioters were the same as bankers			0
‘ it ’s about irresponsibility , wherever we find it in our society			0

police : our robust tactics were not a result of political interference
