glittering gold : the models all strutted around on the stage , reminiscent of a catwalk nine @entity61 supermodels including @entity6 and @entity5 wearing bespoke creations by iconic @entity61 fashion designers centre stage : some @entity8 users said that the inclusion of the supermodels was the ' antidote ' to recent positive @entity44 coverage of women one @entity8 user , @entity75 , added : ‘ what ’s great about the @entity44 is that it ’s about people of substance rather than vacuous celebri - oh , never mind ’ @entity77 said : ‘ after two weeks of seeing the most positive role models slogging their guts out , this vacuous celebrity b * * * * * * * is just the antidote ’ while @entity82 said : ‘ the vacuous and self - obsessed fashion industry there , in stark contrast to the hundreds of amazing people surrounding them			1

only nine of the very best – namely @entity92 , @entity91 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 - were featured			2
with her fashions only a few years old – and receiving lukewarm reviews among some critics – observers will question whether her presence on the list is little more than a giant advert			0

one of her lines - entitled , ‘ @entity87 , @entity87 ’ – was recently marketed as being affordable and good value for money			2
but the marketing caused ridicule when it emerged that a sleeveless wool shift dress cost £ 500 while a long - sleeved day dress cost £ 750			0
