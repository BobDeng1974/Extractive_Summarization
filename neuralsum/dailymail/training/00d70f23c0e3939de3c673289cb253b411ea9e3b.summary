by @entity1 reporter published : 22:33 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 06:18 est , 13 march 2014 hidden cameras have captured the birth of three tiger cubs at @entity6			1
three of the world 's rarest tigers were born to five - year - old @entity12 tigress @entity13 on february 3 after a 106 - day pregnancy , keepers announced today			1
the cubs arrived in the early hours , and all were born within an hour			2
the first cub was born at 12.28am , the second at 12.59am and the third made its entrance into the world at 1.18am			0
the zoo has yet to establish the sex of the cubs			0
@entity13 and her cubs remain together inside special ' cubbing dens ' with the mother only occasionally venturing away from her babies for food			0
their birth will be a welcome addition to the zoo as it comes less than six months after the death of the zoo 's first @entity12 tiger cub in 17 years			1
keepers at the zoo were left ' very distraught ' after the cub was found drowned on the edge of the pool inside the tigers ' enclosure , two weeks after its birth in october			2
the cub had been the grandchild of the zoo 's last tiger cub , @entity58 , the father of @entity13			1
little explorers : keepers have nicknamed one of the cubs trouble , as it 's much bolder than the others welcome addition : the birth of the triplets comes less than six months after @entity13 's last cub drowned @entity69 said : ' we could n't be more delighted with our new arrivals , and with how @entity13 is responding to her three cubs			1
' we 've been observing them 24/7 , and one of us is always on duty to keep an eye on the little ones throughout the night			0
we 've even been able to observe key milestones like their eyes opening and their tentative first steps			0
' while we still do n't know whether they 're boys or girls , we 're starting to see their personalities develop			0
we 've nicknamed one @entity84 , as it 's much bolder than the others - it was the first to start exploring its den , and we 've spotted it waking up its siblings when they fall asleep			0
' ever felt like you 're being watched ? the triplets ' entire birth process was monitored using remote cameras in the @entity94 there were 1,000 @entity12 tigers in the wild ; today there are believed to be just 300 individuals			1
if numbers continue to decline at that rate , they face a very real threat of extinction within the next decade			2
the cubs represent a great achievement for the zoo and the global breeding programme for the critically endangered species			0
while mother @entity13 relaxes with her cubs , visitors to the zoo can still see six - year - old father @entity112 in @entity113 , and there will be exclusive footage of the cubs on the zoo 's @entity118 channel throughout this month .			1
