allowing council tenants to buy their homes was one of the ‘ greatest conservative ideas of the last century ’ , @entity0 said last night			1
the prime minister pledged to ‘ keep backing ’ @entity11 ’s flagship right to buy policy , and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves			1
his comments follow speculation that the @entity15 want to extend the policy , perhaps by including 2.5million housing association tenants			1
@entity19 words : @entity0 has pledged to ‘ keep backing ’ the right to buy policy , and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves work and pensions secretary @entity25 also wants to reward social housing tenants who hold down a job for a year or more with an automatic stake in their properties			1
in a pre-election rally in @entity33 , mr @entity0 said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a ‘ country man ’			1
and he claimed that a @entity37 government would result in higher borrowing costs ; pushing up mortgage cost for families by an extra £ 1,000 a year			0
last night a poll found that the @entity42 have taken the lead over @entity37 – and that voters believe @entity45 would be burdened with more debt if @entity47 wins office			0
polling from @entity50 , a former @entity51 deputy chairman , found that the @entity42 had opened up a two - point lead over @entity37			0
in a pre-election rally in @entity33 , mr @entity0 said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a ‘ country man ’ it also found three times as many people believe a @entity37 government will result in more borrowing and debt than if mr @entity0 remained in office			1
speaking at a property firm in @entity64 yesterday , the prime minister said : ‘ we will give more people the chance to own their home by backing the @entity69 to buy , and more security for those who rent			1
‘ @entity69 to buy is one of the greatest conservative ideas of the last century – because it ’s about pure , undiluted aspiration			1
‘ as conservatives we do n’t believe that people ’s circumstances need to be stuck in one place forever			2
if you ’re out of work – you do n’t have to stay out of work			0
‘ if you ’re in poverty – you do n’t have to stay in poverty			2
if you had a difficult start in life – you do n’t have to repeat the same patterns you were born into			0
all these things can be overcome with the right opportunities			0
‘ and that is what @entity69 to buy is about – people ’s hard work taking them from being tenants in their home to owners of their home			1
’ he added that critics of @entity69 were invariably homeowners themselves			1
‘ whatever some social commentators say , people do have a deep desire to own a place of their own , ’ he said			1
‘ and it ’s interesting – often the people who criticise @entity69 to buy , who think it ’s unnecessary , are speaking from the comfort and security of a home that they own			2
rally : @entity0 applauds a speaker as he prepares to deliver a speech setting out the @entity51 's sixth manifesto theme at @entity114 in @entity64 ‘ as conservatives we do n’t think it ’s one rule for us and one rule for them			1
we want to give everyone the chance of owning their own home			0
‘ so we extended @entity69 to buy			2
thirty - three thousand more people have become homeowners this way , and our @entity51 commitment for the next @entity128 is to keep on backing this scheme			2
’ mr @entity0 also pledged to protect the green belt if the @entity42 win the next election – saying he wanted his children to walk on unspoilt countryside such as the @entity134			1
building must take place on brownfield land as a priority , he said , but he acknowledged that building could not be restricted to such land			0
he said @entity45 is on target to build 200,000 homes a year by 2017 – bearing @entity37 ’s target by three years			0
‘ when it comes to our @entity145 , i have been clear , ’ he said			2
‘ the line remains scored in the sand – that land is precious			2
i am a country man			0
‘ put simply : the @entity145 is protected with us			0
and it is not just green belt that concerns people but green fields			0
’ the prime minister also said that a future @entity51 government will ‘ keep mortgage rates low ’ so that homeowners can ‘ go to bed with real peace of mind ’			1
pledging that maintaining low borrowing costs would be the first priority of the @entity15 ’ housing policy , he attributed the @entity45 ’s historically low interest rates of 0.5 per cent to his government ’s deficit reduction programme			1
he said @entity37 ’s plan to borrow for investment would result in higher borrowing costs for home owners			0
‘ and do you know what that could cost people ? just a one per cent rise in market rates would add £ 1,000 to the average mortgage bill			0
‘ @entity45 ’s home owners can not afford that			0
so in the next @entity42 would see through our long - term economic plan , clear the deficit , run a budget surplus by 2018 , and help keep mortgage rates low			0
