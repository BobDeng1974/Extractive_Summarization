by @entity0 desperate times require desperate measures – and when an impala was targeted by two vicious cheetahs , it made a jump for it that will not soon be forgotten			1
the distressed animal was captured on camera leaping into a car full of tourists in order to escape the predators			1
the terrified animal appeared to be seconds away from death when an unexpected window of opportunity appeared – quite literally			1
as the two ferocious animals appeared to have cornered the impala – it leaped into a nearby car which happened to have its windows rolled down			1
@entity35 , 20 , happened to be filming the chase when the impala jumped through the passenger - side window of a @entity39 in front of her			1
she said : ‘ we started freaking out going crazy			0
we could n't believe it - we were absolutely dumbstruck			0
‘ we had absolutely no idea what was going on			0
‘ we watched the cheetah chasing the impala			2
we saw a few of them turn around in the bushes towards the road they were running from			0
' sweet escape : a group of impala flee across a road in @entity24 , @entity25 when one of them take an unexpected turn swift exit : as the last impala cross the road , the cheetahs ' intended meal finds a novel way to escape ‘ all of a sudden we saw the impala jump out of the bushes and then someone started screaming ' it is in the car , it is in the car '			1
‘ we heard a little girl screaming in the car			2
the boy sitting outside the car filming looked a lot younger , so it must have been a family			2
‘ people in other cars screamed ' open the door , open the door '			0
’ in the confusion , one of the passengers managed to open a door and the impala is seen just seconds later trotting across the road to freedom			0
the cheetahs are just yards away but do not give chase			2
the footage was captured in @entity24 , @entity25 , where according to park rules you must stay inside your vehicle at all times			1
as the terrified impala realises it is the cheetahs ' chosen meal , it looks for a way out , and spots the car unexpected visit : one person inside the car appears oblivious to the fact that an impala is on its way inside the vehicle and continues to film the cheetah chase just dropping by : this is the moment when the impala jumps into the tourists ' car in front of the chocked cheetahs the bewildered cheetahs are left with long noses and empty stomachs as the impala disappears into the car miss @entity35 , who is studying supply chain management at the @entity123 , was with her friends @entity125 , 20 , @entity126 , 21 , and @entity127 , 21			1
unlike some of her friends , she has made several trips to @entity24 but was left stunned by the trip			1
she added : ‘ my family are so jealous			0
in all the years my parents have been going to @entity24 they have never seen anything like it and we do go regularly			1
‘ it really is a once - in - a - lifetime thing and we managed to be in the right place at the right time			0
‘ i was very happy to witness something like that but i felt a sorry for the cheetah			0
‘ there are so many impala , it is not like they will miss one of them			0
’ however , the world 's fastest land - animal was not completely ‘ cheetah - ed ’ , as one of them managed to make a kill a mere dozen feet along the road , according to @entity154 .			2

@entity156 made an *unusual* escape at @entity24
the animal jumped into a tourists ' car to avoid becoming lunch
the two chasing cheetahs were left bewildered and *hungry*
