@entity2 has been damaged by ‘ unthinking climate change worship ’ , a senior @entity1 minister claimed today as the coalition parties clashed over going green			1
@entity6 energy secretary @entity5 is using the floods crisis to launch an extraordinary attack on ‘ diabolical ’ and ‘ wilfully ignorant , head in the sand , nimbyist ’ conservatives who question global warming			1
but conservative energy minister @entity14 has hit back , insisting now is not the time for ‘ political ’ squabbling			1
clash : @entity6 @entity5 attacked @entity1 climate sceptics but @entity1 energy minister @entity14 warned against coalition squabbling the storms which have wreaked havoc across much of @entity22 and @entity23 have reignited the debate about the role of climate change on altering weather patterns			1
in a speech to @entity29 , mr @entity5 insisted the disaster that has befallen much of @entity22 demonstrates ‘ the possible consequences of a world in which extreme weather events are much more likely ’			2
mr @entity5 said climate change denial and euro - scepticism are a ‘ diabolical cocktail ’ that threatens efforts to tackle global warming			1
the attempt to exploit the flooding crisis to attack the @entity1 came as @entity41 came under pressure over his ‘ money is no object ’ pledge on aiding victims			2
but mr @entity14 , the junior @entity1 minister in mr @entity5 ’s department , condemned the outburst by his boss			1
he told the @entity50 : ‘ this is not a time for @entity52 squabbling			0
we should all be focusing on getting people ’s power back on and protecting the sub stations that are in danger of being flooded			0
lord @entity58 claimed there was no evidence linking the floods to climate change ‘ @entity64 climate change worship has damaged @entity2 industry and put up consumer bills			1
' it ’s @entity41 who is cutting green taxes and steering @entity69 away from artificial targets			0
’ mr @entity5 ’s intervention will be seen as an attack on environment secretary @entity73 in particular , who harbours doubts about the degree to which man has contributed to global warming			2
mr @entity5 added : ‘ from the right , fringes of the @entity79 and @entity80 are parroting the arguments of the most discredited climate change deniers – seizing on any anomaly in the climate data to attempt to discredit the whole			1
‘ this is undermining public trust in the scientific evidence for climate change – overwhelming though it is			2
and we can see around us today the possible consequences of a world in which extreme weather events are much more likely			0
this type of climate change denying conservatism is wilfully ignorant , head in the sand , nimbyist conservatism			2
‘ and when married to the europhobia innate to parts of the @entity79 , you have a diabolical cocktail that threatens the whole long - term structure of @entity2 climate change and energy policy			1
' if you accept the logic of climate change , you have to accept the logic of @entity69 co-operation to tackle it			2
’ he was backed by deputy prime minister @entity113 , who said : ‘ it ’s not a secret that in the @entity79 you ’ve got a fair number of people who just do n’t accept the reality of climate change			1
’ speaking on his weekly radio phone - in , the @entity6 minister told @entity123 : ‘ these very violent and volatile weather patterns are linked in some shape or form to climate change			1
‘ other people are entitled to say , no we think it ’s all baloney , but i think at a certain point you ’ve just got to say , look come on , how many more times do you need to be told by people who know what they ’re talking about that this happening , and we ’ve got to do something about it			0
’ former conservative chancellor @entity58 insisted there was no evidence that extreme weather was linked to climate change , and urged scientists to admit they did not know what was happening			2
he told @entity142 's today programme : ' i think we want to focus not on this extremely speculative and uncertain area			0
i do n’t blame the climate scientists for not knowing			0
' climate and weather is quite extraordinarily complex and this is a very new form of science			0
all i blame them for is pretending they know when they do n’t			0
' soldiers attempt to protect a flood - affected property with sandbags in @entity154 play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video play video he said the government should focus on how to prepare the nation to cope with extreme weather instead of trying to tackle climate change			1
' i think this is a wake - up call			0
we need to abandon this crazy and costly policy of spending untold millions on littering the countryside with useless wind turbines and solar panels and moving from a sensible energy policy of having cheap and reliable forms of energy to a policy of having unreliable and costly energy – give up that			0
' what we want to focus on , it ’s very important , is making sure this country is really resilient and robust to whatever nature throws at us , whether there ’s a climate element or not			0
' water storage if there is a drought ; flood defences , sea defences – that ’s what we want to focus on			0
