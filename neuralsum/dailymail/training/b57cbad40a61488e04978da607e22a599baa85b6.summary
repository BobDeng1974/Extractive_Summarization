the mother of a young girl who was attacked by a neighbour ’s dog has criticised police for refusing to get involved - because it happened on private land			1
@entity7 , four , needed 16 stitches on her face after suffering deep cuts just centimetres from her eye when she was savaged by a @entity13 dog which belonged to the next - door neighbour of a family friend			1
@entity7 's mother @entity16 , 33 , said she was distraught that police ca n't take action as the incident happened on private land			1
injuries : @entity7 , aged four , pictured after she was bitten on the face by a @entity13 dog ' distraught ' : mother @entity24 , 33 , says she is distraught that police ca n't prosecute the dog 's owner as the attack happened on private property under the current law , the owner can not be prosecuted because the attack in @entity33 , @entity34 , was not in a public place			1
but this is due to change to include incidents on private property in just a matter of weeks			1
the attack took place last week when ms @entity7 , who works as a carer , was visiting a friend and the neighbour was invited into the garden where @entity7 was playing			1
although the dog is not a dangerous breed , it lashed out and attacked the little girl			2
@entity7 needed eight stitches on her lip , five stitches under her eye and three more on the side of her cheek ms @entity7 , who was in the kitchen of the property at the time , said : ' the dog came into the garden through the back entrance with the owner			1
' it walked past my daughter and just bit her in the face			0
the owner dragged it away			0
i picked her up and she was screaming			0
' i grabbed a tea towel to stop the blood			0
i was just shouting for help			0
' owner @entity72 said : ' i had the dog right next to me			2
the child just barged past the dog and poked it in the eyes and it defended itself			0
' it is not a dangerous dog			0
it may growl sometimes but has never attacked anyone and is friendly			0
' paramedics arrived at the house to treat the girl before taking her to hospital for eight stitches on her lip , five stitches under her eye and three more on the side of her cheek			2
the police were also called but ms @entity7 said she was distraught to find out they may not be able to prosecute over the attack			2
under current law a dog owner can only be prosecuted if their dog is ' dangerously out of control ' in a public place new laws due to come into force before the summer will extend the rules to include private property			1
in this case , if the criminal investigation is dropped the family may be able to take up a civil case against the dog ’s owner			2
@entity113 and @entity114 said : ' we are carrying out an investigation			0
we have had no previous incidents reported to us involving this dog			0
' law : @entity7 's family could take up a civil case if the criminal investigation is dropped ' @entity124 defence ' : @entity72 , owner of the @entity13 dog ( stock image pictured ) , said it is not a dangerous animal and was only defending itself when poked in the eyes by the child			1

she needed eight stitches on her lip , five stitches under her eye and three more on the side of her cheek
