on all metrics , the threat to @entity8 is worsening , ' he also says , according to @entity13			0
the prime minister is expected to announce an increase in funding for national security agencies , and present a more cohesive plan that would see state and national efforts brought in alignment			2

the prime minister is also expected to announce an increase in funding for national security agencies , and present a more cohesive plan that would see state and national efforts brought in alignment mr @entity6 may also reveal that another attack , like the one carried out by @entity86 ( pictured ) is likely ' my judgment is that – while having always to respect both – the question of precisely where we draw the line in the era of terrorism will have to be reconsidered and the line may have to be redrawn			1
' meantime the @entity8 reported that mr @entity6 will also announce that another terrorist attack is likely given the current climate			2
