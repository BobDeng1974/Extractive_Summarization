by @entity0 published : 17:55 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 03:27 est , 22 april 2013 for 1,088 days they have braved storms , floods , snow and torrential rain to prevent the spread of an illegal gipsy camp on the edge of their village			2
but yesterday the villagers of @entity12 celebrated victory after the @entity14 who threatened to destroy their rural idyll were finally forced to leave			1
the triumph is a hard - fought win for the hardy band who have maintained a round - the - clock vigil to stop further development at the camp since april 2010			1
defiant : a traveller fuels a fire at the site in @entity12 yesterday as villagers triumphed over the @entity14 at the same time , the residents have faced a long and arduous legal fight to remove the travellers , who have repeatedly used delaying tactics to stay on the site			1
some of the villagers have also faced death threats , had their homes vandalised and been labelled racist			1
last month the gipsies lost their three - year legal battle to stay on the land			2
a judge at the @entity41 in @entity42 gave them until the weekend to move and ordered they must restore the @entity46 site to its former state within a month			1
the last travellers to leave , in a final act of defiance , started a fire and torched a caravan			1
today the villagers will end their blockade of the site and mark their victory with a minute 's silence at 10am			1
@entity58 , spokesman for @entity60 , said : ' there is a great sense of relief that they are leaving			0
' the determined residents - some of whom are now in their eighties - have taken turns to huddle under a tarpaulin with little more than a fire for comfort in temperatures as low as minus 18c every day and night since the @entity14 gipsies arrived			2
time to leave : a caravan is towed from the site at the end of a 1,088 day year battle in the courts in a bizarre twist , the residents at one point found themselves ordered by planning officials to remove their rudimentary protest camp , while no action was being taken to remove the travellers			1
the residents ' nightmare began when the @entity12 gipsies paid £ 100,000 to buy the paddock and , in time - honoured fashion , moved on to the land at the start of a bank holiday weekend - when the council was powerless to stop them developing the site			1
but they had not reckoned on the determination of villagers to preserve the @entity98 green belt which separates the village from @entity100 and @entity101			2
as word spread , residents swung into action , descending on the eight - acre site and forming a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of hardcore rubble to the site later that evening			1
ever since , around 200 residents have manned their camp around the clock to make sure the site is not developed any further , working to a rota with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight			1
until now the travellers have repeatedly managed to stop their eviction in a tortuous legal process that has involved 19 court appearances			2
damage : the field , which has been occupied by travellers since april 2010 , was left torn up by vehicles after moving on to the site , the travelling families lodged a retrospective planning application , which was turned down by the local authority , but they managed to stay as they lodged an appeal			1
in 2011 , @entity130 , the secretary of state for communities and local government , upheld a planning inspector 's recommendation that the appeal should be dismissed - but the travellers continued to remain			1
last month , the travellers finally lost their three year legal battle to stay on the land , when they lost their appeal against mr @entity130 ' decision at the @entity41			1
mr @entity138 said that they would now campaign to make sure the site , turned into a muddy quagmire by the travellers , was returned to its former state - a paddock once covered in wildflowers			2
he said : ' they still need to return the camp to the way it was the day before they moved in , exactly the way it was			0
' that means not just leaving but removing all the sewerage and water pipes under the ground that they installed and reseeding the ground			0
vigil : villagers ( l - r ) @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity58 , four days before their victory ' we will keep up with targeted protests until that is done			2
' he added : ' we need to make sure they do n't just bulldoze everything , they must return it to exactly how it was before they came			0
smoke : firefighters were called to the site after the @entity14 set fire to a large shed last week ' we 'd like to stay until they have , but we know that the council have taken legal action against both sides so we will leave on monday			2
' we will hold a minute 's silence when we leave for those members of the protest who did n't make it			1
' mr @entity138 added that the group had helped to lobby for new laws introduced which give councils greater power to deal with ' bank holiday ' invasions and illegal developments			0
previously , councils could n't take action against occupants of caravans once they had moved on to a site , but they now have new powers which allow them to halt illegal developments to send temporary stop notices			0
he said : ' the legacy of the campaign is not only in the lane in terms of the battle for the land being won			0
' our country 's laws have changed			0
it 's far wider than the little local battle			2
it 's been a case of local actions with national implications			0
' mr @entity138 , who has received multiple death threats , reflected on the personal sacrifices he had made whilst leading the campaign and vowed to spend more time with his family			1
the training consultant said : ' i 'll be able to spend more time with my 82 - year - old father who 's not very well			0
i regret not spending as much time with him as i should have			0
' i can also spend more time on my business , as i 'm self - employed			0
' landowner @entity224 , who calls himself the ' @entity225 of @entity12 ' and is a spokesman for the travellers , yesterday joked about how the camp had damaged the village 's reputation as he repeated claims that the residents ' campaign has been racially motivated			1
hard - fought : travellers speak to firefighters who were called to put out flames at the site he said : ' there are no winners here , we have been left homeless and the residents have been left with the stigma of the gypsy site having been there			1
' the head of @entity248 's house is still barely worth £ 5,000 even when we have gone , the history of us being there is all over the place			0
' this was never about green belt land , it was only about not wanting gypsies on their doorsteps , they told me that many times			0
' he added : ' i ca n't tell you where the families have gone because many of them are forced to stop at the roadside now and the police have moved them on a few times already			0
' we will still be around , you just wo n't be able to see us any more on the land			0
' the council could have helped us , found a new site and moved us in straight away			0
then everyone would have been happy			0
