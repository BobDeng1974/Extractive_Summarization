@entity2 's 12 - game unbeaten run was brought to an end as they lost 2 - 1 at home to @entity5 , who came from behind to win for the first time since late august thanks to a @entity9 brace			1
the @entity11 leaders went in front through @entity13 after @entity14 had saved a @entity16 penalty , but @entity5 substitute @entity9 struck twice from close range in the second half to end @entity2 's hopes of a club - record seven consecutive clean sheets			1
although @entity5 had not won since august 30th , they had drawn their previous four games and there was little in the match until the 31st minute when @entity25 put @entity26 in on the left only for @entity14 to block the midfielder 's low drive with his legs			2
@entity5 came back from a goal down to end @entity2 's impressive run of 12 games unbeaten in all competitions @entity9 ( left ) celebrates his second goal with @entity16 , who had missed an earlier penalty @entity13 celebrates his and @entity2 's only goal against @entity5 alongside team mascot @entity38 it started a good period of possession for the visitors but they were almost caught on the break in the 36th minute when @entity45 ran away from two defenders down the right to win a corner that went behind off a @entity2 player			1
another swift attack , this time down the left , created a decent opening for @entity2 when @entity53 carried the ball across the face of goal before setting up @entity45 who curled a shot narrowly wide from 20 yards			0
@entity45 was involved in a moment of comedy in the 41st minute when he was barged over by @entity25 and crashed into @entity5 boss @entity60 , who was knocked off his feet to the great amusement of the @entity2 fans			0
@entity60 also saw the funny side of it but he was not smiling as the first half ended in dramatic fashion with his side missing a penalty before @entity2 scored in added time			0
@entity2 skipper @entity72 ( right ) and @entity74 captain @entity73 lock horns during a bit of handbags @entity2 goalkeeper @entity14 ca n't watch as he sees his go agonisingly close to scoring a late equaliser @entity79 striker @entity78 shows his frustration after missing an opportunity from a free kick @entity2 were stunned when referee @entity83 gave a handball against @entity85 just inside the box , but @entity16 's spot kick was brilliantly saved by @entity89 diving to his right			2
@entity13 then went down the other end and opened the scoring when he bundled the ball in after @entity94 flicked on a free - kick			0
although his team were ahead , head coach @entity96 made two changes at half - time , replacing @entity53 and @entity100 with @entity101 and @entity102 , and the latter almost doubled the lead with a 20 - yard shot that @entity106 could only parry in the 56th minute			0
derby manager @entity96 cuts a defeated pose as he watched his side fall to @entity5 @entity2 went close again in the 67th minute when @entity110 's shot deflected off @entity102 and went just wide , but @entity5 equalised two minutes later when @entity25 's low ball from the right was turned in from six yards by @entity9			1
it was the first goal @entity2 had conceded in 644 minutes and they found themselves trailing seven minutes from time when @entity9 scored his second of the afternoon from eight yards after @entity14 could only parry a shot from @entity117			0
@entity78 curled a free - kick agonisingly wide but @entity5 held on through five minutes of stoppage time to repeat last season 's win at @entity2 .			1

@entity2 went in front through @entity13 before @entity9 double
