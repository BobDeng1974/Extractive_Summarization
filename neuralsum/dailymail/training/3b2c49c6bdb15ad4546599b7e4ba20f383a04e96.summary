by @entity0 failing to protect yourself online is so irresponsible , it could threaten the economy of entire nations			2
that 's according to a security report by @entity8 - based group , @entity7 , which suggests cybercrime is now such big business , it is worth more than the wealth of some countries			1
as a business , cybercrime would be ranked 27th in the world based on revenue , and the attacks are currently costing the world more than £ 238 billion ( $ 400 billion ) a year			1
that 's according to a security report by @entity8 - based group , @entity7 , which suggests cybercrime is now such big business that it is worth more than some countries @entity30 , which disrupted the viruses that led to the @entity32 issuing a two - week alert last week , has been highlighted as an example of the sort of global collaboration that needs to occur more often			1
the @entity38 - led operation has thwarted an international crime ring that infected hundreds of thousands of pcs across the globe with malicious software that stole more than $ 100 million ( £ 59.4 million ) from businesses and members of the public since 2011			1
the @entity46 announced earlier this month that anywhere between 500,000 and 1 million machines worldwide were affected by the virus 's known as @entity50 which stole banking passwords and @entity52 , which encrypted files and blackmailed the users for their release			0
' these schemes were highly sophisticated and immensely lucrative , and the cyber criminals did not make them easy to reach or disrupt , ' said @entity58 , who heads the @entity46 's criminal division , to a news conference			2
but while the grip of those behind the ' malware ' has been weakened by the counter attack , computer experts said users must take this opportunity to install anti-virus software and update their operating systems to the latest versions to stop it regaining its hold			2
this is equal to more than 0.5 per cent of the world ’s total gross domestic product , damaging the global economy almost as much as illegal drugs and piracy , according to ‘ the @entity79 ’ report			1
security experts , including from @entity82 law enforcement agency @entity81 and @entity83 , have been discussing the report , and what more needs to be done to stop the increasing amount of web attacks			1
they claim the big problem remains a lack of understanding among the public about different threats that exist			1
‘ i ’ve got young children , and i know that i ca n’t be there every time they cross the road , ’ said @entity93 , the chief technical officer of @entity7 in @entity94 and a special adviser to @entity81			1
‘ what i can do is teach them the dangers of crossing the road and hope that they can protect themselves			2
technology does play a part , but the user plays a part as well			0
‘ [ last year ] i went to a shopping centre , and there were people giving away chocolate in exchange for your personal data , ’ he added			0
‘ the queue was 40 people deep			0
i said ‘ why are you giving up your data for a piece of chocolate ? do you not realise it has more value ? ’ as part of the report , @entity93 revealed there are 20 to 30 cybercrime groups that are operating on a ‘ nation - state level ’			1
this means they are working on an industrial scale , and overcome almost any sort of web defence they face			0
‘ we want the economy to grow , and it ’s being held back by cybercrime			1
‘ if you ’re not taking important measures you ’re contributing to criminals , and i mean nasty criminals , making money off you			0
not taking action is resulting in people losing their jobs , ’ he said			0
he added that ideas are the currency of the digital age and our ideas are being stolen			0
‘ do you want the next @entity153 to be out of @entity154 and @entity155 ? it wo n’t be if we do n’t protect our data because they ’ll steal it and run it somewhere else , ’ he said			0
@entity30 , which disrupted the viruses that led to the @entity32 issuing a two - week alert last week , has been highlighted as an example of the sort of global collaboration that needs to occur more often			1
@entity165 , from @entity81 , said that this operation , which involved officers from the @entity38 , the @entity168 and around the world , was the perfect example of the collaboration that is needed to take on cyber criminals			1
‘ no single law enforcement agency can get an instant result on their own			2
we have to work in partnerships and @entity30 was a great example of this with the pooling of resources and ideas			2
this is not the end of the war however			0
the war goes on , ’ he said			0
as a business , cybercrime would be ranked 27th in the world based on revenue , and the crime is currently costing the world more than £ 238 billion ( $ 400 billion ) a year			2
this is equal to more than 0.5 per cent of the world ’s total gross domestic product , according to ‘ the @entity195 ’ report the report found that more than 200,000 jobs had been lost as a result of cybercrime - through reputation damage or loss of assets			1
the news comes in the wake of continued efforts to improve web security before the ‘ two - week threat ’ elapses , and two viruses that have infected thousands of computers are active again			1
potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers - whose attempts have been temporarily thwarted - can rebuild their network			0
the @entity38 @entity217 urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers			0
if systems do not offer automatic updates , people should enable it , the department said			0
it also advised changing passwords , as original passwords may have been compromised during the infection .			0

cyber attacks cost world more than 0.5 *%* of its gross domestic product
it damages global economy almost as much as illegal drugs and piracy
@entity7 report found 200,000 jobs had been lost as a result of attacks
there are 20 to 30 cybercrime groups operating on a ‘ nation - state ' level
the *challenge* remains in the lack of understanding among the public
the report comes in the wake of @entity30 , which disrupted the viruses that led to the @entity32 issuing a two - week alert
