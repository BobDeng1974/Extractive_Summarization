@entity0 won their first pre-season game of the campaign at the sixth attempt as @entity5 's third strike in three games helped them to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity8 at the @entity9			1
the surprise summer signing from @entity11 continued his excellent pre-season so far by firing in @entity0 's second goal from the edge of the area just before half - time			2
@entity17 had opened the scoring on the half - hour mark to send @entity21 ' men on their way to their first pre-season victory			1
subs not used : @entity52			0
goals : @entity17 ( 30 ) , @entity5 ( 43 )			2

three draws and two defeats - with just four goals scored - from their first five pre-season matches was not what @entity21 would have expected from his side			1
and with just one match left - away to @entity80 on saturday - before @entity0 host @entity81 in their first @entity84 match of the season on august 16 , this victory will have provided @entity0 's squad with some much - needed confidence			1
@entity8 started the match the brighter , however , with @entity62 striking an early volley safely into the hands of @entity34			0
@entity5 then tested former @entity54 in the @entity8 goal with a powerful header on eight minutes following a cross from @entity17			2
former @entity95 striker @entity48 then kept @entity54 busy with a 20 - yard piledriver			0
in charge : @entity0 manager @entity21 walks along the touchline during their match with @entity8 competitive : @entity0 's @entity30 ( right ) passes the ball under pressure from @entity8 ' @entity64 ( left ) and the opener came on the half - hour mark , with @entity5 and @entity44 linking up well with a neat one - two before @entity35 lashed a cross into the box for @entity17 to slide in and put the home side ahead			1
@entity8 responded almost immediately , with @entity108 smashing a shot wide from 20 yards			0
but @entity0 soon doubled their advantage			0
just before half - time , @entity5 ran at the @entity8 defence and unleashed an unstoppable shot from the edge of the area into the back of the net for his third strike of pre-season			2
with @entity0 coming out after the break 2 - 0 ahead , @entity21 ' men sat back a little and @entity8 had the first opportunity of the half			1
substitute @entity124 crossed for fellow replacement @entity70 , whose shot sailed over the bar from 15 yards out			0
appeal : @entity0 striker @entity5 protests to the referee after a strong challenge on him by a @entity8 player the @entity131 were then desperately unlucky not to pull a goal back as they hit the post twice in quick succession			0
@entity72 rocketed a shot off the woodwork before @entity59 managed to pick out the exact same spot with the rebound			0
@entity8 continued to dominate the second half and it took a brilliant save from @entity0 in the 71st - minute to deny @entity72 when the striker broke clear and rushed towards the @entity0 goal			1
@entity34 's heroics seemed to finally jolt @entity0 back to life as the immediately attacked and @entity5 was unlucky not to add his second of the evening when his sliding shot was well - saved by the feet of substitute goalkeeper @entity148			1
@entity5 was taken off in the 79th - minute to a standing ovation			2
he looks set to be a @entity152 fans ' favourite			0
double : @entity5 readies himself to unleash the shot that put @entity0 2 - 0 up against @entity8 at the @entity9			1

@entity17 taps in @entity35 's cross to put @entity0 ahead in 30th minute
