it was a big night for musician @entity1 , conducting an orchestra for a prestigious concert in @entity4 as television cameras rolled in the background			1
but during this performance his life changed for ever			1
his left hand had been trembling uncontrollably			1
it was n’t the first time – it had been happening on and off for several months , but he had ignored it			1
as he stepped off the stage , one musician asked : ‘ what ’s going on with your hand ? ’ ‘ i looked down and could n’t stop it shaking			1
if other people were starting to notice , i had to do something about it			1
’ debilitating illness : musician @entity1 , pictured with wife @entity22 , initially blamed his shaking hand on drinking too much , but after a series of tests found he had @entity26 's @entity1 , who was 42 at the time and has worked with @entity28 and @entity29 , initially blamed the tremors on drinking too much red wine , and he cut out alcohol			1
although he had been suffering neck and back pains for more than four years and kept crying out in his sleep , he never imagined it was linked to his shaking hand			1
‘ i thought they were just stress dreams , ’ he says as he sits in the music room of his @entity39 home with wife @entity22 , 42 , the glamorous mezzo soprano			1
in october 2012 , @entity1 ’s @entity42 referred him to a neurologist , who sent him for an mri scan to check for brain tumours			1
next , he had a series of tests			2
‘ i had to establish how quickly i could move my fingers , putting my hands in front of me to see if one side reacted more slowly than the other			2
the doctor noted weakness , shaking and slow reactions in my left hand			2
he also noticed that when i walked , my left arm did n’t swing – a classic sign , i later learned , of the diagnosis that would soon follow			2
the fact that i did n’t blink much and my left leg shook were also clues			2
’ family strength : conductor @entity1 has the support of mezzo soprano @entity22 , pictured here with their daughter @entity67 , now 12 @entity1 had feared it was @entity26 ’s , and when this was confirmed he was devastated			1
‘ when the consultant phoned , i somehow knew			2
i was n’t surprised , but i was shocked			2
my first reaction was a mixture of denial and panic , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ i just thought , “ i ’m a working dad with three kids			2
how is this going to impact everyone else ? i need to support my children			2
” ’ popular perception of @entity26 ’s is that it affects the elderly , but it can be diagnosed at any age , with one in 20 sufferers being under 40			1
of 127,000 @entity84 with the disease , more than 6,000 were diagnosed before their 40th birthday			1
‘ @entity26 ’s causes the nerve cells in the brain that make the chemical dopamine to struggle , be damaged and eventually die , ’ explains @entity87 , from @entity26 ’s @entity84			2
‘ these nerve cells are mainly in a part of the brain involved in movement , so they ca n’t get messages through and people start to develop problems with movement			2
for example walking is more laboured			2
’ as the condition progresses , it can affect talking , digesting , writing , mood and sleep , as dopamine is also in part responsible for these			0
‘ although @entity26 ’s is very similar in many ways , we tend to find that in younger people the condition progresses more slowly and they respond better to the drugs , ’ adds @entity87			0
there is no specific blood test for @entity26 ’s			0
in @entity1 ’s case , his neurologist ’s diagnosis was confirmed by a @entity116 , which measures how much dopamine is available in the brain			1
it showed the right side of his brain , which affects the left side of the body , was n’t properly producing the chemical			0
@entity22 immediately went into practical mode , phoning her mother to come and pick up the kids so she and @entity1 could spend the next few days frantically learning everything they could about the disease			1
they told their eldest child @entity67 , then ten , because she sensed something was wrong , but their two - year - old twins @entity136 and @entity137 were too young			1
it was just before @entity139 , so they tried to give the children as normal a celebration as possible			0
for the first year they confided only in close family			0
‘ i spent a long time trying to hide it , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ it ’s common for people to worry about their employer ’s reaction and my big worry was if i ’d be booked for concerts and other jobs			0
’ but as his shaking hand became more obvious , and fearing his colleagues might mistake it for nerves , he decided to tell people			0
‘ i felt what i said had to be done in a positive , inspiring way			0
i did n’t want people feeling sorry for me			0
it ’s pity i dread the most			0
i just want people to be normal around me			0
‘ @entity29 cracked a few jokes , saying i ’d make a good cocktail waiter			0
i ’d rather that than pity			0
’ @entity1 admits he is still in denial – but each new symptom yanks him back to reality			1
‘ i ’ll wake up and my left eye will take longer to open , or my finger might be bent round and i have to bend it back			0
’ at the moment his problems are mainly stiffness , rigidity and tremors			1
they are all worsened by cold weather or stress , which makes work difficult at times			0
‘ i ’m coping , and looking at getting a giant @entity181 so i do n’t have to turn pages while conducting			0
if it gets too difficult , i ’ll focus on composing and producing			0
i struggle with depression , but i think that ’s a reaction to my diagnosis			0
’ there ’s no cure , and drug treatments , which aim to boost dopamine , have limited effect			0
@entity1 , now 44 , takes @entity192 , used in the early stages to manage symptoms , and has physiotherapy so he can keep working for as long as possible			1
doctors ca n’t predict who will get @entity26 ’s – unless you ’re in a small minority with a genetic predisposition – or how quickly it will progress			0
@entity22 knows she will one day be @entity1 ’s carer , but the fact the couple have been together since they were 18 has helped them stay strong			1
they organised a summer concert , @entity208 1 , at the @entity209 hosted by @entity210 and with performances by @entity29 , @entity212 and @entity213 , which helped raise more than £ 125,000 for @entity215			1
they hope to hold another next year			0
‘ just as important as the money was increasing understanding , especially for those with @entity26 ’s , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ this disease can happen to anyone at any age but there is some exciting research that gives hope for the future			0
