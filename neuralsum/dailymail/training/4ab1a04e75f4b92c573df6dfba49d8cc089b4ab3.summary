by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 was forced to deal with criticism from too close to home for comfort but was adamant that @entity6 are on the right path to one - day riches			1
the demolition of @entity6 ’s one - day approach by @entity11 and @entity12 in a @entity14 wet - weather radio debate was eye - catching because @entity11 in particular has so recently stepped outside of the team environment			1
the crux of @entity11 and @entity12 ’s argument is that @entity6 ’s 50 - over cricket remains in the dark ages under a captain in @entity31 who should have rested up after proving his test point and left this to the big - hitting kids			1
not so , said @entity2 , who hopes @entity6 will prove one of their best captains and one of their greatest spinners wrong , starting against @entity20 at @entity39			2
claim : @entity11 and @entity12 believe @entity6 's 50 - over cricket remains in the dark ages under @entity31 overlooking : @entity41 looks on during a net session ahead of wednesday 's odi with @entity20 ‘ i think guys have been picked because they ’re very capable of making big scores in one - day games , ’ said the man who will one day replace @entity31 as captain in both formats			1
‘ we ’ve prepared really well and it ’s exciting for us			0
those guys are paid for their opinions and they are entitled to give them , but we know where we are as a side			0
we are comfy and ready to go			0
’ @entity6 must have thought @entity31 ’s position would have ceased to be an issue after runs and three successive test wins but @entity2 , who scored more than 700 runs in the test summer , was obliged to come to the captain ’s defence			1
‘ he ’s our leader in one - day cricket as well as @entity19 , he ’s done well over a number of years and we all back him , ’ said @entity65			1
‘ he ’s a fantastic player and has got all our support			0
his style complements players like @entity71 and hopefully that can be shown this series			0
we want to show what we can do as a one - day outfit			2
i do n’t think there ’s much of a problem with the batting			0
’ stroke : @entity80 hits out past @entity81 during @entity6 net practice in sight : @entity6 bowler @entity84 playing @entity85 during the training session the argument is a fascinating one			0
@entity6 , yet to win a @entity89 and outsiders in next year ’s tournament in @entity92 and @entity93 , were widely expected to introduce more than just @entity71 from the next generation here			0
but a combination of outstanding performances in the last three tests from the likes of @entity80 and @entity99 coupled with the largely poor form of the @entity102 top order against @entity93 a this season forced a partial re-think			0
certainly @entity11 ’s assertion that @entity6 ‘ do not have a cat in hell ’s chance ’ in the next @entity89 seems a bit over the top when , in effect , they will only need to put three good 50 - over displays together against decent opposition to win in @entity92 and @entity93 because of the @entity89 ’s flawed format			2
@entity31 proved @entity115 wrong when he was labelled a ‘ plodder and a donkey ’ after becoming one - day captain three years ago			1
now , starting at the @entity119 , he has the chance to do the same to @entity11 and @entity12			2
had his say : @entity12 admits @entity31 proved him wrong but says @entity6 's one - day game is unncessary do n't bother : former @entity6 cricketer @entity11 poses with the @entity89 trophy in @entity124 @entity125 says @entity6 can take winning momentum into @entity17			1

@entity2 is convinced that the @entity19 players who defeated @entity20 will prove equally adapt at the shorter game
@entity12 and @entity11 said @entity6 's odi cricket was in the dark ages under captain @entity31
‘ he ’s our leader in one - day cricket as well as @entity19 , he ’s done well over a number of years and we all back him , ’ said @entity134
