under attack : @entity2 's pledge to hike foreign aid has been opposed by a powerful committee of peers @entity2 was last night urged to abandon his controversial foreign aid target as a major report warned that it will fuel corruption and waste			1
a powerful committee of peers attacked the prime minister ’s pledge to increase aid spending by 37 per cent to more than £ 12billion a year in order to meet an ‘ arbitrary ’ @entity17 target			1
@entity18 said they fully supported humanitarian aid for disaster zones			1
but they pointed out that it accounts for less than 10 per cent of the vast budget of the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			1
in a devastating verdict they warned that the rush to increase spending ‘ risks reducing the quality , value for money and accountability ’ of the aid programme			1
the finding is a major embarrassment for mr @entity2 who is said , while in opposition , to have adopted the target of spending 0.7 per cent of @entity40 ’s income on aid , partly to help ‘ detoxify ’ the @entity42 ’ image as ‘ the @entity44 ’			1
the cross-party economic affairs committee said ministers seemed more interested in the amount of money they were spending on aid than the results they were achieving			2
the committee ’s chairman , former @entity42 cabinet minister @entity51 , said : ‘ we were unanimous in our view that legislation for a 0.7 per cent target is inappropriate , and that the government should reconsider			2
‘ we believe aid should be judged by the criteria of effectiveness and value for money , not by whether a specific arbitrary target is reached			0
’ the committee also called on ministers to ‘ urgently prepare an early exit strategy ’ from @entity40 ’s £ 1.1billion aid programme for @entity65			0
@entity18 said sending hundreds of millions of pounds to a country that can afford its own space programme provided a ‘ perverse incentive ’ for the @entity65 government to shirk its own responsibility for tackling poverty in its vast population			0
they also criticised @entity25 for failing to do enough to tackle corruption			1
peers said they were ‘ greatly concerned by the paltry and implausibly low levels of fraud identified by @entity25 ’			1
they said they had heard ‘ compelling evidence ... that aid can frequently finance corruption ’			2
labour peer @entity81 said : ‘ almost every witness expressed concerns about corruption			2
we heard some pretty grim stories			0
@entity25 and the secretary of state need to up their game			1
’ £ 1.1billion in aid ... @entity65 's maiden lunar mission @entity89 , or @entity90 in ancient @entity91 , takes off from the @entity92 in 2008 mr @entity2 has passionately defended the commitment to the target against angry critics – including many of his own mps – who say the aid budget should not be spared the axe being taken to public services			2
he has said the government will not ‘ balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world ’			0
but lord @entity106 , a @entity42 member of the committee , said : ‘ the debate about not balancing the books on the back of the poor sounds very good but that implies that we are maintaining the budget , not that we are aiming to increase it by 37 per cent			1
‘ it is very difficult , when you look at what ’s happening to other programmes , to justify one programme being increased by 37 per cent			1
’ the @entity119 has pledged to enshrine the aid target in law but legislation has been delayed because of fears of a public backlash			0
the committee said international development secretary @entity126 was unable to ‘ put forward any case for legislation other than the government ’s political commitment to it ’			0
the study found the @entity40 already spends a much higher proportion of its income – about 0.55 per cent – on aid than most other countries			2
the @entity136 spends 0.2 per cent			0
the scale of the opposition raises doubts about whether the legislation will get through the @entity141			0
mr @entity126 last night hit back , saying that the aid programme was helping to get 11million children into school , vaccinate 55million children and prevent the deaths of 250,000 babies			0
‘ the government makes no apologies for sticking to its commitments to the world ’s poorest people , ’ he said			0
‘ going back on this promise would cost lives			0
’ billionaire @entity156 founder @entity155 , who now runs his own charity tackling disease in the developing world , said : ‘ abandoning the 0.7 per cent target risks undermining the incredible progress that has been achieved over the last several years			1
‘ well - targeted @entity40 aid has helped save millions of lives by rolling back the malaria and @entity166 epidemics and bringing the world closer to eradicating polio once and for all			0

just 10 per cent of @entity25 budget goes to disaster zones
increased spending ' risks reducing accountability '
@entity25 *slammed* for failing to tackle corruption
