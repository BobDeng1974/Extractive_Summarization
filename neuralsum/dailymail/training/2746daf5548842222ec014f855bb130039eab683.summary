@entity1 investigators have revealed the search for the @entity4 flight may have been in the wrong area up until now			1
in a flight path analysis released by the @entity8 on wednesday , it suggests that experts may have finally uncovered the @entity11 's resting place			1
the latest report details that the plane could have ran out of fuel then spiralled into the southern part of the @entity16 in march			1
since then , no traces of the plane nor its 239 passengers and crew on board have been found			1
the @entity40 - contracted @entity39 vessel began hunting for traces of wreckage or jet fuel on monday about 1,100 miles off the @entity45 coast , which is where experts believed the plane crashed			2
later in the month , two ships sent by @entity50 contractor @entity49 will join the @entity39 as part of an operation that could last more than a year			0
but the latest @entity8 's detailed analysis has released information which may relate to where @entity1 could have been descending at that time of disappearance			2
' the simulator activities involved fuel exhaustion of the right engine followed by flameout of the left engine with no control inputs , ' it said			0
' this scenario resulted in the aircraft entering a descending spiralling low bank angle left turn and the aircraft entering the water in a relatively short distance after the last engine flame - out			0
' @entity73 ( pictured ) , which along with the @entity40 - contracted @entity39 , will soon start a new high - resolution search for missing @entity1 an image of a @entity49 autonomous underwater vehicle searching for flight mh370 this is in proximity to the seventh arc , believed to be in the southern of the @entity16 , where the aircraft ran out of the fuel and crashed into the ocean			1
yet this comes as investigators admitted ' changes to the prioritisation and location of search activity ' and further stated they will be refocusing on the refined analysis of flight and satellite data			1
' the latest analyses indicates that the underwater search should be prioritised further south within the wide search area for the next phase of the search , ' the report states			2
however there are implications that there may also be changes to the new search area			0
' although of reasonably high confidence , and relatively large , this area does not contain all the possible derived paths , ' the report states			0
' the ongoing refinement may result in changes to search asset deployment			0
' despite an extensive search for the missing plane , no traces of it has been found since march 8			1
all 12 members of staff on board the flight - including both pilots - were @entity40 nationals			0
of the 227 passengers , there were six @entity123 on board			0
@entity45 has been leading the search for @entity1 at the request of the @entity127 .			2

new report reveals that @entity1 could have ran out of fuel and spiralled into southern part of @entity16
the report also admits experts may have been searching in the wrong area
investigators will be refocusing their search into the refined analysis of flight and satellite data
