by @entity0 @entity0 has struggled with the lack of affection shown to her by her father perched on the edge of my father ’s deathbed during the last moments of his life , i hoped i could finally find some peace			1
after a lifetime where i ’d felt anything but cherished by him , i thought this might be his moment to make amends for all those years of emotional neglect			2
‘ is there anything you would like to say to me ? ’ i asked , pressing a notebook and pen into his hand as throat cancer had robbed him of his ability to speak			2
my 75 - year - old father , @entity29 , started scrawling onto the lined paper and i held my breath			1
perhaps , after years of longing , this would be the moment when he would tell me how proud he was of me and how much he loved me			2
instead , when i read his final words , my heart sank			2
it was n’t a message for me , his 41 - year - old daughter , but for his 27 - year - old girlfriend of two years who lived in @entity41			2
he wanted me to tell her that he loved her and would watch over her for ever			2
i do n’t know why i had expected anything different			0
hurt as i was , i went downstairs to the telephone box , called my father ’s girlfriend and relayed his last loving words to her			1
words which i had for my entire life longed for him to say to me			0
even at the end , my father refused to dole out any love or praise to me			1
his third cousin , the late artist @entity55 , once described himself as : ‘ a selfish man who only does what pleases me			0
’ my father was exactly the same			1
it ’s little wonder that @entity61 ’s recent confession that her mother did n’t applaud her for her brilliant acting career , and only praised her once , really resonated with me			0
only in my case , it was my father , not my mother , who consistently refused to acknowledge any of my virtues			1
like so many men born in the early 20th century , his inability to praise or encourage could have been a symptom of the post-war era in which tough love reigned supreme			1
but i ’m not about to defend him			0
growing up without a single word of praise from your father is tough			1
until the age of six , i had been daddy ’s girl , my father had doted on me , photographed me constantly , and , in his @entity82 accent , dubbed me his ‘ @entity83 ’ , @entity84 for ‘ little thing ’			1
but then i developed buck teeth and became fat and ungainly and , quite simply , my father lost interest in me			1
cold : wendy with her father @entity29 around the same time that @entity0 's father ( pictured ) lost interest in her , he began having extra-marital affairs with an assortment of women and making a mockery of his marriage to @entity0 's mother , @entity97 it was around this time that he went off on his own adventures , having extra-marital affairs with an assortment of women and making a mockery of his marriage to my mother , @entity97			1
the import and export business he and my mother owned was doing well , so there was enough money to send me to drama school when i was nine years old			0
when i bounced home every night , reciting reams of @entity111 by heart , my mother applauded enthusiastically while my father could n’t have cared less			1
he watched , wordless , his face impassive			0
throughout my entire schooling , he never once came to speech day or my end - of - term play.when i started to blossom into womanhood , my mother was quick with the compliments			0
she told me what good skin i had , how pretty my eyes were , how glossy my hair was			1
by now , after a 16 - year marriage , my parents had divorced			0
my mother , though still in love with my father , could no longer grapple with the pain of his infidelity			1
an inability to show love can be a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder and while i still longed for his approval , i knew that the chances of getting it were remote and so i avoided him as much as possible , rarely spending time with him and his new wife , a blonde actress who was 25 to his 40			1
on one of those rare occasions , out of the blue , he said : ‘ your stepmother has a better figure than you			0
’ then , for good measure : ‘ and your mother is prettier too			1
’ why he would want to compare me to my mother or his second wife was utterly incomprehensible , but it cut through me like a knife			0
he never recognised my professional successes , either			0
when , at 20 , my first article was published , i proudly showed it to him , only for him to cast it aside with the words , ‘ it ’s good , but i could do better ’			1
his comment stung then , and still resonates to this day			0
despite having had 14 books published since , never hearing my father say ‘ well done ’ or ‘ i ’m proud of you ’ still leaves me with a gaping hole in my heart			1
it was no coincidence that , aged 16 , i fixed on a man of 38 as my first great love			2
but while he gave me my first kiss , he ultimately rejected me , and i was bereft			0
consequently i did n’t look to men for reinforcement , kindness or praise , or live my life waiting for @entity166 to save me			2
@entity0 's parents : divorced after 16 years of marriage , @entity97 , @entity0 's mother , still struggled with her now ex-husband 's infidelity			1
pictured : @entity0 's parents instead , i carved out my own existence and lived my life as my own woman , strong and independent , determined to follow my own destiny rather than merely be the frame to some man ’s picture			1
my father was not so cruel to my six sisters , five of whom he had with two different women and who were a good deal younger than me			1
i think he had grown up by the time they arrived and was more warm and loving with them			0
yet he still seemed to encourage us to compete with one another for his affections			0
in fact , it was only after his death that i grew close to my three eldest half - sisters , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			2
today i like , love and respect all three of them , and cherish our times together , but i am still bitter that by trying to pit us against one another , my father deprived me of the happiness of growing up with my sisters , and having them in my life through the years			1
until the age of six , @entity0 was a real daddy 's girl			1
pictured : wendy as a child with her father when @entity0 developed buck teeth and became fat and ungainly , her father lost interest in her			1
pictured : wendy as a child with her parents on his deathbed in @entity211 ’s @entity210 in 1997 , with all of us gathered around him , he pointed to each of us in turn , explaining what he thought of us , saying one was pretty , another clever , a third funny			0
and me ? ‘ she ’s nothing , ’ he said			0
even at the end , he reserved the cruellest blow for me , his eldest daughter			0
i never did understand what prompted such deep disdain			0
when i asked my mother , quick as a flash she said : ‘ @entity227 , he was still a child , and was jealous and competitive and wanted all the praise for himself			2
’ the end result was that he just could n’t bring himself to give me the praise and love for which i longed			1
by withholding it , he remained in control and that , above all , mattered to him			0
the very last time i saw him in hospital , too weak to reach into his bedside drawer , he asked me to get something for him			0
as i did , i saw a copy of the magazine in which i had published an article			0
it was dog - eared and well thumbed			0
just as i lifted it out , my father ’s nurse appeared			2
‘ oh , you ’re the writer , ’ she said			0
‘ your father is always talking about you			2
he ’s so proud of you			0
’ as my eyes filled with tears , i turned to my father , but he looked away and said nothing .			2

@entity0 had a good relationship with her father until she was six
when she got fatter and developed buck teeth , her dad lost interest in her
even on his death bed , her father refused to express love or praise @entity0
