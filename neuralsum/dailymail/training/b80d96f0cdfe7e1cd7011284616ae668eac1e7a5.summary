by @entity1 reporter published : 07:57 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 26 july 2013 standing in a room filled floor to ceiling with old irons , pensioner @entity2 shows his astonishing collection of the trusty household appliance			1
the 74 - year - old has one of @entity12 's largest collections of irons - amassed during three decades of scouring fairs , antique shops , and auction houses			1
he now owns a staggering 800 irons - which includes irons in all shapes , makes , sizes and colours , ranging from the first one he ever bought , a box iron right up to modern day steam irons			1
astounding : @entity2 from @entity25 , @entity26 , shows off some of his collection of 800 irons prized : mr @entity2 amassed his extraordinary collection of irons over the past 30 years and his record breaking array of gas irons numbers no less than 240			1
but his passion for collecting irons has not quite stretched to using them – his second wife @entity37 , 67 , still does all the ironing in the house			1
' i suppose the daftest thing is that do n’t even iron , ' admitted @entity2			1
' @entity44 does all the ironing in our house			1
i ’m absolutely useless at it			2
' all of my shirts are pristine hanging in the wardrobe , but it ’s nothing to do with me			2
' mrs @entity53 said : ' @entity2 did try but he was n’t very good at it , he ended up with more creases than when he started			1
' i do n’t let him use my iron , it ’s modern and electric and i do n’t let him anywhere near			2
' ironic : mr @entity2 confesses to being useless at pressing his clothes so leaves all the ironing to his wife @entity37 restored : mr @entity2 founds many of his collection in poor condition but he managed to restore them to good condition neither of mr @entity2 ' two children have inherited their father 's passion for irons , which was kindled more than 30 years ago			1
since then he has been gathering an impressive array of the everyday household item most of us would n’t think twice about			1
it all started back in the 1980s when mr @entity2 had an idea how to make the hearth in his front room look a little less bare			1
' i was walking around a scrap yard and i thought i ’ll have that flat iron , ' he said			2
' i paid about a fiver , i cleaned it up and put it in the hearth			0
things just grew from there			0
' @entity87 age : many of mr @entity2 's collection would have been commonplace decades ago but are increasingly rare history : an old photograph from around the 1900 's shows how the irons would of been used in laundry factories since then retired engineer mr @entity2 has spent much of his spare time at antique shops and fairs following his passion			1
he said : ‘ i ’m six feet tall and they tower above me			0
' ' i clean and dust them , it ’s a bit of a task			0
there ’s a dehumidifier in there to stop them getting rusty			0
it ’s on all the time			0
' many of them are rusty when i get them , i restore them , coat them in wax , then put them on display			0
i think it looks rather splendid			0
' cherished items : mr @entity2 has one of @entity12 's biggest collections of irons which he has amassed over the past 30 years			1
spectrum : mr @entity2 's collection includes models in a wide variety of colours dedication : mr @entity2 has spent the past 30 years searching for additions to his growing collection of irons posterity : mr @entity2 hopes he can preserve a bit of history with his collection of gas irons but despite the size it ’s not the biggest collection in the country			1
that honour goes to one of his rivals in @entity139 who has around 1000 irons			2
' at the last count i had 240 gas irons and no one else can rival that , ' he said			2
' people think " what do you need all those for , you only need one ? " and i suppose they ’ve got a point			0
' but for me it ’s all about history , for every iron i ’ve saved hundreds must have ended up in skip			0
i just thing young people should know how people lived in the past			0
' naturally he ended up joining the @entity159			0
there are about 120 members and they meet twice a year			2
rivalry : mr @entity2 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , has a little friendly competition with other collectors to find the rarest or most prized irons in antiques fairs and sales around the country @entity169 : at last count @entity2 's collection included an unrivaled 240 gas irons ' for some people it might seem like the sort of gathering where things could get a bit flat , but we enjoy ourselves , swapping stories and irons , ' explained @entity2			1
mr @entity2 has always said it would ' make his day ' to own a @entity184 speckled green gas iron			1
he believes only 10 colours were made			0
but he ’s not the only one scouring stalls and @entity187			0
' there ’s lots of competition between members ... friendly rivalry you know , ' he said			0
' there are a couple of irons i would love to get my hands on , but i wo n’t say what they are			2
people might try and cash in			0
that ’s all i ’m going to say			0

@entity2 spent 30 years amassing his array of the household appliances
74 - year - old filled a room at home in @entity25 floor to ceiling with irons
he confesses he 's ' useless ' at using them so wife @entity37 does all the ironing
