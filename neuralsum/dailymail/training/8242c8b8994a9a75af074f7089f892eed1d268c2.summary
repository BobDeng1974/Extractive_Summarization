a waiter who dreamt he would win the @entity1 the day before he bought a winning £ 1million ticket will keep half of the jackpot after his boss 's bid to get the lot fell through in court			1
@entity9 envisaged himself holding bundles of cash as his restaurant 's manager @entity12 stood in front of him			1
the next day mr @entity9 shared his premonition with his boss and mr @entity12 gave him money from the till to buy a @entity19 ticket , with the pair winning the @entity21 and getting their hands on £ 1million			1
but the young waiter 's dream turned into a nightmare when his boss declared that all the winnings should be his , as the money used to purchase the ticket came from his till			2
waiter @entity9 ( right ) and restaurant boss @entity12 ( left ) will share a £ 1million lottery jackpot after a legal wrangle over the jackpot despite having a party at the restaurant to celebrate the win in january 2012 , mr @entity12 claimed he had paid for the £ 9 ticket and chosen the numbers and was therefore owed the full winnings			1
the war of words ended up in court , with a judge ruling last year that the cash should be split 50/50			1
mr @entity9 persuaded his boss to donate money from the restaurant till towards the ticket - as he felt that if the two joined forces they would win			1
but the waiter claimed he had paid half the stake and contributed to the number choice - and was therefore due a share of the cash			0
ruling on the case , judge @entity55 said mr @entity9 ' had a dream ' on the night of january 29 , 2012			2
' he dreamt that he was holding a large bundle of cash and , standing in front of him , was his boss			0
' mr @entity9 is a strong believer in the power of dreams and interpreted this to mean that he and mr @entity12 would win the lottery , ' he said			1
the next day , mr @entity9 ' pestered ' his boss for several hours before he relented and passed him coins from the restaurant 's till to towards the ticket			2
the pair won £ 1million on the euromillions draw after clubbing together to buy a ticket in january 2012 the inspired waiter who went to a nearby supermarket and bought the ticket which yielded the riches , the court heard			1
but mr @entity12 , 47 , who runs the @entity80 @entity79 restaurant in @entity81 , said he paid the entire stake and had chosen the winning numbers , claiming the winnings should be his			2
mr @entity9 was adamant that it was his dream that prompted the win , that he had paid half the £ 9 stake and that some of the number choices were his			0
he later complained to police , alleging mr @entity12 had ' stolen his winning lottery ticket from his jacket pocket '			0
he told @entity1 operators camelot the same story - and mr @entity12 was arrested and held for nine hours before he was eventually released without charge			2
mr @entity9 later admitted making the bogus allegation because he wanted to stop his boss from ' getting his hands ' on the cash and ' sending it back to @entity100 '			0
last year judge @entity55 found that the men each played an equal part in the win and that each had paid half the stake			0
both judges viewed a series of increasingly angry texts between the pair and @entity112 footage of events in the restaurant as the winning slips were filled in			0
the footage strongly suggested that both men had shared the task of choosing the winning numbers and that each had paid half of the £ 9 stake			0
the judge concluded : ' i find that the effect of these conversations was that mr @entity12 and mr @entity9 entered into a contract to jointly play the lottery on an equal basis			1
' there should be a declaration that the prize money from this winning lottery ticket should be shared equally between mr @entity12 and mr @entity9			1
' however mr @entity12 disagreed with the ruling and appealed , saying that he deserved the full £ 1million			1
mr @entity12 's barrister , @entity135 , argued at the appeal hearing yesterday that @entity137 ' failed to understand the significance ' of the text messages			0
court battle : a judge ruled that they should split the cash 50/50 , with mr @entity12 appealing the decision dispute : an appeal judge ruled the pair , who worked at @entity80 ( pictured ) restaurant in @entity81 , must split the cash 50/50 , with each man taking home £ 500,000 but lord justice @entity152 said : ' in my view , this argument has no real prospect of success			1
' the judge acknowledged that the weight of the texts appeared to support mr @entity12 's case and mr @entity9 's explanation of them depended on the judge 's conclusion as to the nature of the relationship between them			1
' rightly , in my view , the judge concluded , in the end , that the texts were equivocal			0
' he assessed that he had to rely on other factors to determine whether the ticket was purchased jointly			0
' this led him to prefer the evidence of mr @entity9 on a number of significant issues , including the texts			0
there is no reasonable argument that the judge misunderstood the importance of the text evidence			0
' the conclusions he reached were properly open to him and i see no real prospect of the @entity184 reaching a different conclusion			0
for that reason , the application must be dismissed , ' lord @entity152 ruled that the money should be split 50/50 between the pair .			2

waiter @entity9 had a dream he would win the @entity1 with his boss
he persuaded restaurant manager @entity12 to buy ticket with him
their ticket won £ 1million , but mr @entity12 said the jackpot was all his
the case ended up in court , where a judge ruled they should split it 50/50
*unhappy* with the £ 500,000 winnings , the boss appealed the decision
