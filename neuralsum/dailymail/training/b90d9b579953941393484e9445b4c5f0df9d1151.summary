by @entity1 reporter published : 13:29 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 23:02 est , 17 august 2012 in 2003 , @entity2 was the world 's most wanted man , but in the face of the full force of the @entity8 army his fiercely loyal former driver offered to help the toppled dictator			1
it is claimed that @entity12 's links with the brutal leader started in 1959 with @entity2 being born in a village just to the north of mr @entity12 's home of @entity17 in central northern @entity18			2
@entity8 soldiers correctly concluded that @entity2 would return to the base of his power in the tribe lands where he had grown up , but identifying his exact whereabouts still took time			2
@entity2 's last stand : the ' @entity25 ' is finally captured by @entity8 troops in december 2003 after hiding in a hole dug by @entity12 in tones that oscillate between boastful and reserved , mr @entity12 has spoken for the first time about the assistance he gave to @entity2 in the wake of the allied invasion			1
' he came here and asked us for help and i said yes			0
he said , ' you might be captured and tortured , ' ' but in our @entity39 tribal tradition , and by @entity41 law , when someone needs help , we help him , ' mr @entity12 was reported as saying in the @entity43			0
mr @entity12 then dug a hole - a tiny underground bunker - in a dirt patch on his farm where @entity2 hid out before he was captured in december 2003			1
with the help of his brother , @entity49 , and other members of his family , @entity2 also moved among various safe houses in the area			1
while he must have known that his ultimate demise was inevitable , according to @entity55 the ' @entity25 ' did what he could to evade his pursuers			0
hiding place : @entity8 soldiers stand by the small hole in the village of @entity62 near @entity63 where @entity2 stayed for many months successfully evading capture declining the use of a mobile phone because he knew soldiers would be listening for his voice , mr @entity12 says @entity2 instead passed his time writing prose and poetry , but that these scribblings were seized by forces when he was captured			1
mr @entity12 says he helped to arrange secret trips to the farm for @entity2 's only visitors - his sons @entity76 and @entity78			2
the former farmer , who now runs a restaurant with four of his brothers , also went to great lengths to conceal the location where @entity2 recorded fiery speeches encouraging his supporters to fight on against the @entity87 forces			1
mr @entity12 says he once drove 10 miles to the city of @entity89 to record natural sounds by a river in a bid to put @entity2 's hunters off the scent			2
after @entity2 was captured , mr @entity12 was held at the notorious @entity96 jail where he says he was questioned daily about the possible whereabouts of weapons of mass destruction			1
he says he was tortured at times , being hooded and beaten and bitten by guard dogs and was kept in the dark 24 hours a day			0
rock music was blasted into his cell and buckets of water were thrown in there to keep it constantly wet			0
aide : during the time he helped @entity2 mr @entity12 says he helped to arrange secret trips to the farm for @entity2 's only visitors - his brothers @entity76 and @entity78 ' i endured the dogs and the torture , but i could n't stand that music , ' says mr @entity12			1
the @entity55 family are now held in high esteem among the locals , many of whom still have a soft spot for @entity2			0
col. @entity123 said he considered what the @entity55 family did for @entity2 ' heroic '			0
@entity2 was buried a short distance away in the village of @entity127 where he was born			0
in response to his continuing popularity in these parts @entity18 premier @entity131 has ordered his grave site to be closed to the public to prevent it becoming a shrine			0
today ' the hole ' from which @entity2 was finally pulled has been sealed over with concrete and is almost unnoticeable amidst cages containing parakeets and doves .			2
