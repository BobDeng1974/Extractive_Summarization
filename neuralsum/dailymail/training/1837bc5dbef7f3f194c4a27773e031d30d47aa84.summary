while the @entity0 oozed glamour as she gave a ceremonial welcome to the president of @entity4 , many could be forgiven for thinking the rest of her family might have been enjoying the benefits of her royal lifestyle			1
but as @entity0 , who is around 13 weeks pregnant with her second child with prince @entity12 , rubbed shoulders with fellow royalty in @entity15 , her parents and sister were mingling with the public at a remote airport hundreds of miles away			1
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 proved they are not too posh to fly economy class as they boarded an @entity24 flight from the @entity25 to @entity26 yesterday			1
despite opting to take the budget airliner , the family chose to pay £ 12 each for priority boarding however , while the trio - spotted arriving with hand luggage at @entity30 - may have opted for the cheap travel option , they did at least fork out up to £ 12 each for priority boarding			1
with tickets available for as little as £ 54 for the 600 - mile journey , @entity20 , 31 , and her parents shocked onlookers as they waited in the terminal before boarding the budget flight			1
one passenger on the plane , who asked not to be named , said : ' we saw them wandering around the terminal			0
' @entity54 is a tiny airport , and there was only one plane on the runway , otherwise i might have thought they were flying in a private jet			0
they 're rich enough , i suppose			0
' i think they had paid to select their seats , which meant they got to board the plane first , and were all sat in a row when i finally made it on the plane			0
' they 're practically royalty , but it 's nice to know that they 're not too posh to fly with normal people			0
' onlookers said the @entity76 mingled in the terminal before boarding the flight from the @entity25 it is not the first time @entity20 , 31 , ( right ) and her parents @entity18 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) have chosen to fly with the budget airline			1
