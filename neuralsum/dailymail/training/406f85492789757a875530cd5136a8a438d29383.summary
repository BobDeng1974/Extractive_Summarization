by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was last night simmering on the subjects of ‘ respect ’ and ‘ freedom ’ after @entity7 ’s attempts to move the title clash at @entity9 were flatly rejected			1
@entity7 asked the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity9 if they would agree to hold the game today rather than tomorrow			1
while the broadcasters were said to be open to the idea , the @entity10 ruled it out without consulting @entity9			1
@entity2 refused to retract his threat to rest players from the @entity18 game , claiming @entity7 had not received the respect they deserved as @entity22 ’s most successful @entity21 team of the last decade			1
the @entity23 : @entity2 is fuming after his request to play @entity9 earlier was denied @entity25 to head : @entity2 has threatened to field a weakened team against @entity27 ' ( @entity28 ) @entity9 he also promised to help his rivals if the roles were reversed next year			1
‘ if next season @entity7 play an @entity32 team that is playing the @entity33 semi-final two or three days later , @entity7 will accept to play the game one or two days before to give the @entity32 team more chance , ’ he said			1
‘ we would be protecting @entity32 football without creating any problem for @entity7			2
’ @entity2 ’s ongoing dispute over fixtures is , however , one of several struggles with the authorities			2
the @entity10 are investigating his absence from some press conferences recently and he has until monday to answer his third @entity48 misconduct charge of the season , which relates to the sarcastic congratulations he offered to referee @entity51 and referees ’ chief @entity53 after losing against @entity54			1
‘ i ca n’t say the truth because i do n’t feel free , ’ said @entity2 , rekindling memories of the infamous ‘ cuffed hands ’ salute he aimed at the @entity58 fa during his time at @entity60			2
‘ i ca n’t speak			0
every time i speak , there ’s a consequence			0
even when i think the referee is amazing , there ’s a reason to be charged			0
’ the @entity7 boss stressed his priority would be wednesday ’s @entity33 semi-final against @entity70			1
the tie is goalless after the first leg in @entity73			0
‘ i ca n’t lose more players , ’ he added			0
‘ you think if i lose one more player , i have any chance to play the final ? lost for words : @entity2 made a cuffed hands gesture to signify his censorship while manager of @entity60 in the dock : @entity2 and coach @entity85 have been charged for incidents after the @entity54 defeat ‘ i do n’t think we have a chance			1
in attacking areas , if i lose one , i have another , but there are positions where i ca n’t lose one			0
‘ the most important thing for me is my club and the supporters			0
@entity7 fans would like @entity7 to get the respect @entity7 deserves			1
‘ they know what @entity7 has done for @entity32 football for the last 10 years			2
‘ @entity7 has been the most important club to defend this country in @entity21 competitions			1
@entity104 : @entity2 argues that @entity7 should be treated better as the most important @entity32 team in @entity106 , after winning the @entity33 and @entity107 title deeds : @entity7 travel to @entity18 five points behind @entity9 with three game remaining ‘ the last to be @entity21 champions , the last to win the @entity107 , the club with the record of presence in semi-finals			1
@entity7 fans , they think @entity7 deserve more respect than they ’re getting			2
‘ they want @entity7 to go to @entity9 and play , as always , at the maximum , giving everything			1
with which players ? that ’s our decision , not your decision			0
‘ if we are not helped to try to follow our dreams and our objectives , it is one more reason for us to close , to think about us and only us			0
’ dropping like flies : @entity128 will not play again this season after dislocating his shoulder in @entity73 sidelined : @entity131 will not play against @entity9 after limping off with an ankle injury against @entity70 @entity2 has claimed all season that @entity32 teams are disadvantaged in @entity106 because they can not move games around at will like their rivals , and dismissed the fact that , this week , @entity70 will also play sunday and wednesday			1
‘ luckily for us , they have no choice , ’ he said			0
@entity70 ’s fixture happens to be against @entity142 , who played in a @entity107 semi-final on thursday			2
otherwise , @entity2 thinks that the game would have been played today			2
he acknowledged the sweetener for @entity32 clubs came in the form of millions of pounds from @entity11 rights but added : ‘ maybe , one day , for seven , eight , nine , 10 years you do n’t have a @entity21 champion or a team in the semi-finals and the people who pay the big sums says : “ eh , the big teams , the most important teams in @entity106 are n’t here ”			1
bigger fish : @entity2 has made @entity7 's return leg against @entity70 his priority after a goalless draw of the @entity9 game , he said : ‘ we are going to try and win , ’ but he has big decisions in defence , where @entity165 and @entity166 could be involved , and in goal , where he must choose between @entity168 and @entity169 , who has not played for nearly three years			1
selection will depend on the fitness of @entity131 , @entity172 and @entity173 , all ruled out of the trip to @entity176 but who could be ready for @entity106			2
@entity178 will not play at @entity18 as he is banned for four games after flinging an arm into the face of @entity54 ’s @entity182			2
‘ he ’s a lucky guy , ’ said @entity2 changing the angle and making @entity178 the victim			2
‘ in less than a minute , he was lucky [ @entity187 ] @entity186 did n’t break his leg , lucky that @entity182 did n’t break his @entity190 and lucky he only got four matches ’ suspension			0
he ’s a lucky guy			0
’ ' lucky guy ' : @entity193 @entity178 has been hit with a four game ban after being caught lashing out at @entity182 he declined to comment on @entity9 ’s quest for their first title in 24 years and on the work of his friend @entity27 this year			2
these , he said , would be delivered in private			0
nothing either on @entity203 sold by @entity7 last year or @entity204 , who @entity2 has dubbed the ‘ @entity209 ’ this season , other than a reminder to ‘ check the stats ’			1
asked if he thought neutral fans were with @entity9 , he replied : ‘ i ’m not neutral , i ’m @entity7 ’ and asked if he thought @entity212 deserved a winner ’s medal , he replied : ‘ why ? many big players never won it			1
’ despite his glum look , @entity2 insisted he had not lost his taste for @entity32 football			0
‘ i love it , i love it , ’ he said			0
‘ the fans , the stadiums , the yellow ball in winter , the white ball in summer , the @entity227 final with @entity228 , the semi-finals with @entity229 and @entity230			0
@entity231 hot ! @entity204 has been dubbed ' @entity232 ' by @entity2 this season the @entity233 : @entity2 has pointed out @entity204 's talent for winning penalties @entity237 stars : the statitstics prove that @entity7 have been the best @entity239 team in @entity106 over the last 10 years ‘ all of this is @entity32 football and i love @entity32 football			1
’ his love for @entity7 burns strongly , too , he added , ridiculing the idea he might fancy a move to @entity246			1
‘ i do n’t know how someone could think about it , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ i left @entity249 specifically to come to @entity7			0
i signed a four - year contract			0
i told @entity7 they never have to worry about me because i do n’t want to leave			0
i stay here until the club wants me to leave			0

@entity2 has accused the @entity10 of a ' lack of respect '
