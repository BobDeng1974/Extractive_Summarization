however much they whisper in the shadows about his future as @entity5 manager , @entity7 ’s reputation as a true survivor remains intact			1
in the week in which the city ’s rumour mongers have been working overtime , what was already another stern test of his credentials seemed to take on new proportions			2
the slender victory , courtesy of @entity20 ’s flashing header four minutes from time , is unlikely to see @entity7 handed a fresh long - term deal by new powerbroker @entity23 by the time the week is out — but nor will it do him any harm , either			1
@entity20 celebrates his fine header with just four minutes to go to secure @entity5 ' win at @entity27 as winter grips , @entity7 can now point to a @entity29 semi-final in three months ’ time as further evidence of tangible progress under him			1
@entity34 may even lie in store			2
with his side now up to five wins on the spin since losing at home to @entity38 in the @entity39 , he is at least in a better place than this time last month			1
not for the first time , his timing might just prove to be impeccable			2
in front of a paltry crowd and under the watchful eye of @entity23 ’s right - hand man @entity51 , @entity7 ’s team were not at their best			1
they did not have to be			2
former @entity53 director @entity51 ( left ) was in the stands after becoming a @entity5 consultant @entity5 captain @entity56 rises above the @entity58 defence as he attempts to head his side in front @entity61 ’s @entity58 looked for all the world like a team who believed they were facing the @entity5 of 10 years ago			1
they gave far too much respect to their opponents and could have little complaint that their dream of adding the @entity29 to the @entity69 they won in may is at an end			2
as a player with the club in the barren days of the early 80s , @entity7 would have occasionally experienced @entity27 when populated by sparse crowds			1
even allowing for the tv coverage , apathy and what is seemingly an ongoing unofficial fans boycott , last night ’s attendance of 13,023 was truly startling			2
as the team ’s emerged , you had to remind yourself this was a @entity29 quarter - final tie			2
and one at the start of a new chapter for @entity5 at that			1
veteran @entity5 striker @entity87 tries to tackle @entity89 at the corner flag at @entity27 on tuesday there had certainly been precious little to encourage the home fans on such occasions since liquidation in 2012			1
of the five subsequent matches against teams from higher divisions , @entity5 had won just two			1
saints scarcely arrived with a bullish mind - set , though			0
@entity61 ’s men had been more than happy to leave @entity101 with a point at the weekend having stopped the rot of five straight league losses			0
@entity105 ran off the effects of a late @entity108 clogging to fire a yard past @entity111 ’s goal from 20 yards			2
@entity112 , selected ahead of @entity113 , bounded towards the by - line and picked out the darting figure of @entity116			0
only the diligence of @entity118 prevented a certain goal			0
@entity120 ( left ) is challenged by @entity89 as @entity5 managed to prevail in the @entity121 the early exchanges were worthy of a wider audience			1
@entity125 ’s cross from the right presented @entity87 with a difficult chance and the veteran ’s ambitious scissor - kick never threatened @entity130			0
when @entity20 combined pace on the turn with precision passing on the half - way line , @entity131 was left a free run at the visitors ’ goal			1
@entity130 spread himself well to block although the striker ought to have done better			0
saints ’ were forced into a rethink midway through the first period when @entity143 was stretchered off following an accidental clash with @entity56			0
@entity145 was sprung from the bench			0
often @entity5 ’ killer instinct was not what it might have been			1
when @entity112 played @entity150 into trouble , @entity149 had a host of options both left and right yet was calmly dispossessed by @entity154			0
@entity87 loses possession on tuesday but helped @entity5 reach the @entity29 semi-final there was little to choose between the sides in the opening period yet , by virtue of their stronger finish , @entity58 were left nursing the greater sense of grievance			1
@entity165 sold @entity20 short with a ball out from the back			1
@entity168 leapt upon it and having ghosted to the byline saw @entity171 out of the corner of his eye			0
the defender rose well to connect yet , to his manager ’s chagrin , failed to direct his header on target			2
@entity112 was relishing his floating role and when he produced another excellent delivery from the right , only @entity118 stood between @entity105 and a likely opening goal			0
@entity5 keeper @entity111 clatters into the post during @entity5 ' @entity29 clash with @entity58 the 35 - year - old was taken to hospital after the collision early in the second half at @entity27 @entity190 ’s expertly - controlled volley gave @entity111 food for thought on the cusp of half - time but the breakthrough proved elusive			1
@entity131 was threatening one of those nights			0
when @entity20 ’s incisive pass picked him out seconds after the turnaround , he looked odds - on to score only for @entity201 to block			1
@entity58 were equally as profligate			0
having shown @entity118 a clean pair of heels , @entity112 opted to go for goal rather than square for @entity105			0
@entity111 ’s outstretched arm maintained parity			0
it was to prove the keeper ’s final involvement of the night			0
@entity116 ’s in - swinging free - kick was guided towards the bottom corner by @entity105			2
@entity111 saved well yet could not prevent himself colliding with the post at full pelt			0
as he was stretchered off , @entity215 was brought on for his first @entity5 ’ appearance in eight years			1
@entity20 rose highest in the @entity58 penalty area to score a vital seventh goal of the season for @entity5 the @entity5 squad celebrate the late winner for @entity7 's side to go into the @entity29 semi-final his first involvement was almost calamitous			1
with no need to leave his line , he dashed to meet @entity112 close to the right touchline			0
having lost the race , his relief at seeing the @entity230 man stumble and lose his footing with a clear sight of goal was considerable			0
despite the tiring legs on both sides , openings proved to be more at a premium the longer the game wore on			0
@entity56 did manage to succeed in finding the net with 10 minutes remaining with an impressive headed conversion of @entity20 ’s free - kick but the veteran was adjudged to have strayed offside			1
@entity5 manager @entity244 ca n't hide his delight as @entity20 's header proves to be the winner but just as the spectre of extra-time loomed large , @entity5 struck			1
@entity149 ’s crossing had been erratic all night but with four minutes left he produced a peach			0
cutting back on to his favoured right foot , he whipped an in - swinger over the visiting defence			0
@entity20 rose , connected sweetly and the tie was as good as over			2
@entity108 almost made it two with a raking drive from 25 yards that @entity130 tipped over but the solitary goal was sufficient			0
@entity20 runs to celebrate in front of the @entity27 faithful as his team - mates congratulate his fine header			1

@entity20 scores late header to put @entity5 into the semi-finals
the @entity27 side are the first to reach the @entity121 last four
@entity5 boss @entity7 has guided his side to five consecutive wins
*uncertainty* over @entity7 's future increases after @entity23 's loan deal
