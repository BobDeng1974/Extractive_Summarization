@entity0 insists there is no chance of @entity3 being broken by the strain of trying to lead @entity5 to success in his first season as manager			1
@entity3 ’s side will try and take another step towards the knockout stage of the @entity13 when they face @entity15 outfit @entity14 at @entity16 on thursday			1
progress in that competition would help make up for a double @entity20 exit earlier in a season that has also seen @entity5 toil for consistent @entity24 form			1
@entity3 ( right ) has been backed by his midfielder , and fellow countryman , @entity0 ( centre ) @entity3 ( right ) watches on as his players train ahead of their @entity13 tie against @entity14 saturday ’s 5 - 0 rout of @entity31 was a convincing response to a shock 1 - 0 home defeat from @entity35 , leaving @entity0 hopeful that @entity3 ’s reign is now ready for lift - off			1
the two @entity38 previously worked together in their homeland , but @entity0 believes his manager is growing in stature to meet the huge demands at @entity5 which have troubled some of his predecessors			1
‘ he ’s strong mentally and he believes in what he does , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i did n’t see that side of him at @entity49 because there was n’t that pressure			2
‘ but now , when he has that pressure , he has handled it well			0
he has n’t shown any weak points			0
‘ he has n’t changed , he believes in the football he wants to play and i ’m starting to see that get better			0
‘ could the pressure and criticism break @entity3 ? no , i do n’t think so			2
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) were previously together in @entity38 @entity0 ( left ) believes that @entity3 is mentally strong and will succeed at @entity5 ‘ as i said , he is strong mentally			1
he believes in what he does and , if he does n’t succeed with that , he can be proud of trying			0
‘ but i ’m sure he ’s going to succeed , so that ’s not going to happen			0
’ asked if he felt @entity3 could have the same success in the role as @entity63 , @entity0 added : ‘ i think so — and @entity5 know that , otherwise he would n’t be here			1
’ ‘ we lost against @entity35 and everyone was saying things were so bad but we ’re still in both of the domestic cups			0
‘ we are doing well in the @entity13 and hopefully we can win the next two games in the group and basically get through			2
‘ we want to win the league , so we need to keep picking up three points			0
we ’re still in everything and aiming to get the best results			0
’ meanwhile , @entity5 winger @entity75 could be in line for a comeback tomorrow night			2
the @entity78 international has been out of action since injuring his hamstring in a substitute appearance against @entity83 in august			0
@entity75 had made only one previous start under new manager @entity3 as his fitness jinx continued			2
it is understood , however , that the 23 - year - old has been progressing well in training recently			0
@entity3 remains keen to ease him back into action carefully but he could now be considered for a place in the squad against the @entity15 .			1

@entity5 have endured a *difficult* start to the @entity24 season
they *sit* fifth in the table , but were *buoyed* by a 5 - 0 rout over @entity31
@entity0 believes @entity3 *'s* reign is now ready for lift off
