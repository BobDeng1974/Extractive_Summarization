@entity14 ( pictured , left , in 2009 and , right , while a student @entity32 ) - known as @entity1 - was recorded by campaign group @entity6 complaining about his treatment by @entity2 in the years before he went to @entity27 to join terror group @entity9 in the new tapes , @entity14 said he spoke to an @entity2 officer following his return from @entity18 and was questioned over his views on @entity39 and terrorism			1
in a recording released today , he told @entity6 : ' [ the @entity2 agent ] said : " @entity14 , what do you think of 7/7 ? " i said : " innocent people have died			1
" ' he added : ' he started telling me : " what do you think of 9/11 ? " i told him : " this is a wrong thing			2
what do you want me to say ? "			0
' if i had the opportunity for those lives to come back then i would make those lives come back			0
i do n’t think ... i think what happened is wrong			0
' but the @entity2 agent did not believe his views were moderate and replied : ' i still believe you are going to @entity20 to train			1
' @entity14 moaned : ' he said : ' we are going to keep a close eye on you , @entity14			2
we already have been and we are going to keep a close eye on you ' - threatening me			0
' @entity6 have released the tape as part of their widely - criticised claims that @entity14 was ' harassed ' by security services			1
they were slammed after releasing a statement entitled ' @entity1 : ' radicalised ' by @entity10 ' last week and tried to blame authorities for his actions			2
@entity6 's statement claimed that @entity14 ' desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation , but the system ultimately rejected him '			1
the reported interview with @entity2 took place after @entity14 was refused entry to @entity18 because authorities suspected he was trying to get to @entity20 , where terrorist organisation @entity19 have been known to train @entity10 militants			1
in the recordings , @entity14 ( pictured in the @entity9 beheading videos which earned him the nickname ' @entity1 ' ) claims he condemned previous attacks such as 9/11 and 7/7 when he was questioned by an agent the recordings were released by human rights group @entity6 , who have been widely criticised for trying to blame @entity10 authorities for @entity14 's actions @entity93 's killer @entity92 was picked up by the @entity94 and @entity2 in similar fashion as he tried to enter the east @entity4 country in november 2010			1
extremist @entity97 - known as the ' @entity97 ' after her bomber husband @entity99 took part in the 7/7 @entity102 attacks - is also believed to be part of the @entity19			0
the year after his recorded conversation with @entity6 , @entity14 contacted @entity105 on sunday security editor @entity106 in december 2010			1
he told mr @entity106 he feared @entity2 were following him and wrote in an email : ' sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking , not fearing they may kill me			1
' mr @entity106 recalled : ' like many young @entity3 men at the time who i had interviewed , he appeared to have a grievance against the police and @entity2			1
but this man was different – in him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in @entity27			2
' after foiled attempts to go to his father 's home country , @entity125 , and to get a teaching job in @entity127 , @entity14 slipped out of @entity10 and later appeared in @entity27			1
he has since gained global notoriety as the masked killer of @entity29 hostages including @entity10 aid workers @entity131 and @entity133 in @entity9 beheading videos which have shocked the world			1
@entity14 was interviewed after he was picked up by authorities in @entity18 in 2009 , suspected of trying to get into @entity20 to join @entity138 group @entity19 ( pictured ) other @entity10 extremists have also been linked to @entity19 - including @entity93 killer @entity92 and ' @entity97 ' @entity97 @entity6 has been widely criticised for its defence of @entity143 after he was unmasked as @entity1 last week			1
@entity144 , leader of campaign group , caused outrage by saying the murderer was ' beautiful ' adding that he ' would n't hurt a fly '			1
@entity149 , brother of @entity10 aid worker @entity131 who died at @entity1 's hands , replied saying : ' if he 's a " beautiful , kind man " , why is he killing innocent civilians ? ' he 's a monster			2
everyone should be doing everything they can to capture him and bring him to justice - not stick up for him like he 's been hard done by			0
' @entity157 yesterday distanced itself from @entity6 , saying : ' we do not support all of @entity6 's views or agree with how it expresses them			0
' charities who fund @entity6 are also under investigation by the @entity165 , which said the group 's public statement ' raises questions for a charity considering funding its activity			0
the moaning voice of @entity14 in recordings of him complaining to @entity6 appears to sound different from that in the speeches against the @entity175 made by @entity1 in @entity9 's horrific beheading videos last year			1
the whining tone of @entity143 recorded in 2009 was more nasal and higher - pitched than the deeper voice that speaks over the gruesome films posted online from @entity27			2
the difference suggests @entity9 either used another militant to voice over the films or may have doctored or slowed down @entity14 's voice to make him appear more fearsome in the propaganda films			1
it would not be the first time the militant group have been suspected of digitally - enhancing videos to increase the appeal to their followers			2
a recent sickening film showing 21 @entity192 being beheaded on a beach in @entity194 is widely thought to have been photoshopped			0
experts say the jihadists in the footage were altered to look much taller than their captives and a scene showing sea water stained with blood was created using special effects			0
@entity1 in his own words : full transcript of how @entity14 tried to get off the hook amid suspicions he wanted to train with terrorists @entity14 went to campaign group @entity6 in 2009 after he was questioned by @entity2 over his suspected links to terrorism			1
