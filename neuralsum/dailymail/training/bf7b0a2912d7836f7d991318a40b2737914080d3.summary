by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:16 pm on 29th july 2011 @entity3 's flamboyant socialist leader @entity2 has confirmed he has undergone an operation to remove a cancerous tumor			1
the announcement , which confirmed rumours that had been circulating for nearly three weeks , shocked the @entity10 @entity9 nation ahead of what was already looking like a tight race for a presidential election next year			1
speaking from @entity14 where he underwent surgery june 10 , a pale and emotional @entity2 gave no indication when he would return to @entity3			1
nor did he name a temporary substitute to lead the country of 29 million people			2
@entity3 's president @entity2 looked pale and tired as he confirmed he had undergone an operation on june 10 to remove a cancerous tumour a man in a @entity26 bar listens intently to the president 's televised speech ' they confirmed the existence of a tumorous abscess , with the presence of cancerous cells , which needed another operation to extract the tumor completely , ' he said in his first address to the nation since his surgery			1
@entity2 , 56 , said he was receiving ' complementary treatments to combat different types of cells that were found ' - possibly implying chemotherapy			0
' i deeply appreciate the demonstrations of solidarity by @entity3 and other brotherly people , ' he added , standing at a lectern by a @entity3 flag and a painting of his inspiration , @entity10 independence hero @entity50			1
analysts say a prolonged absence could trigger infighting among his allies - none of whom possess @entity2 's charisma or national appeal -- and possibly prompt calls for an early election by opposition parties gearing up for a 2012 poll			1
' it is impossible to deduce if he will or will not be in a physical state and the right mood to go into the 2012 campaign , ' said local analyst @entity62 said			1
as rumours about the president 's health swirled , the @entity3 government issued this shot of @entity2 with former @entity73 leader @entity72 reading a copy of the @entity76 newspaper @entity75 in @entity14 on june 28 in contrast to his usual jocular and improvisational style , @entity2 read a statement while frequently looking down at notes			1
he looked serious but not weak or debilitated			0
he recognized , maybe for the first time since taking office , that his health had been compromised by his leadership style , based on intense micro-management , constant coffee - swilling and little sleep			1
' throughout my life i 've been committing fundamental errors ... of not taking care of my health and being reluctant about medical treatment , ' he said			2
until thursday , the official line had been that he was recovering well from an operation to remove a pelvic abscess and would return soon			2
inheriting former @entity73 revolutionary leader @entity72 's mantle as @entity99 's main irritant in @entity100 , @entity2 has become one of the world 's most well - known leaders during his 12 years in power			1
comparing his health problem to a previous dark moment - a short - lived 2002 coup attempt - @entity2 promised he would be back in typically grandiose language			2
' i want to talk to you about the rising sun , i think that we have emerged , ' he said			0
there were fireworks in the poor west end of @entity26 , a bastion of @entity2 supporters , and people on the streets shouted ' he 's alive ! he 's alive ! ' @entity2 has appeared to inherit @entity72 's mantle as @entity99 's main irritant in @entity100 and has become one of the world 's most well - known leaders during his 12 years in power others reacted with disbelief but vows of solidarity			0
' my comandante does n't have cancer			0
it ca n't be true			0
he is the best president we have had , a strong man			0
he is not ill , ' said @entity131 , a driver watching the speech and saluting the television screen at a @entity26 bar			2
@entity2 's ministers gave a joint appearance minutes after his speech ended , pledging to deepen his wide - reaching socialist reforms even in his absence and saying the government would remain united			0
' this is not the time to go backward , it 's time to advance , ' vice-president @entity141 said			0
critics of the stalwart socialist responded to the announcement with a mix of snide glee and optimism about the chances for an opposition leader to take over after nearly a decade of failing to unseat him			2
' this will lead to a transition of presidents			0
it 's perfect ! ' said @entity157 , 25 , an accountant			0
' because the revolution does n't work , because socialism is a lie			0
' his government has canceled a july 5 - 6 summit coinciding with @entity3 's 200th anniversary of independence			1
that was a heavy blow for supporters who wanted the charismatic but authoritarian president -- who loves to grandstand at such big events -- back home in time for the national party			0
' this development may open a period of unprecedented social and political uncertainty in @entity3 , ' @entity174 analyst @entity173 said in a note to clients .			1

announcement confirmed rumours of ill health
no indication of when he will return to @entity3 after surgery in @entity73
