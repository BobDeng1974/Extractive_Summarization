by @entity0 music lessons as a child could improve your brainpower for life , researchers have revealed			0
researchers found that children who undertook early musical training were better at quickly processing and retaining information and problem solving			2
musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons			1
researchers found that children who undertook early musical training were better at quickly processing and retain information and problem solving : this image shows functional @entity19 imaging during mental task switching : panels a and b shows brain activation in musically trained and untrained children , respectively			1
@entity24 shows brain areas that are more active in musically trained than musically untrained children			1
@entity27 and colleagues compared 15 musically trained children , 9 to 12 , with a control group of 12 untrained children of the same age			1
musically trained children had to have played an instrument for at least two years in regular private music lessons			1
on average , the children had played for 5.2 years and practiced 3.7 hours per week , starting at the age of 5.9			2
the researchers similarly compared 15 adults who were active professional musicians with 15 non-musicians			0
both control groups had no musical training beyond general school requirements			0
the controlled study using functional @entity19 brain imaging was undertaken by researchers at @entity46			0
' since executive functioning is a strong predictor of academic achievement , even more than @entity51 , we think our findings have strong educational implications , ' said @entity27 , who led the research			0
' while many schools are cutting music programs and spending more and more time on test preparation , our findings suggest that musical training may actually help to set up children for a better academic future			1
' executive functions are the high - level cognitive processes that enable people to quickly process and retain information , regulate their behaviors , make good choices , solve problems , plan and adjust to changing mental demands			0

( on average , the children had played for 5.2 years and practiced 3.7 hours per week , starting at the age of 5.9			2
) the researchers say ' our findings suggest that musical training may actually help to set up children for a better academic future ' the researchers similarly compared 15 adults who were active professional musicians with 15 non-musicians			2
both control groups had no musical training beyond general school requirements			0
since family demographic factors can influence whether a child gets private music lessons , the researchers matched the musician / non-musician groups for parental education , job status ( parental or their own ) and family income			0
the groups , also matched for @entity51 , underwent a battery of cognitive tests , and the children also had functional mri imaging ( @entity102 ) of their brains during testing			0
on cognitive testing , adult musicians and musically trained children showed enhanced performance on several aspects of executive functioning			1
on @entity102 , the children with musical training showed enhanced activation of specific areas of the prefrontal cortex during a test that made them switch between mental tasks			2
these areas , the supplementary motor area , the pre-supplementary area and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , are known to be linked to executive function			0
' our results may also have implications for children and adults who are struggling with executive functioning , such as children with @entity129 or [ the ] elderly , ' says @entity27			1
' future studies have to determine whether music may be utilized as a therapeutic intervention tools for these children and adults			0

could boost calls for more music training in schools
could help the elderly or those with @entity129
team defined musically trained children as having played an instrument for at least two years
