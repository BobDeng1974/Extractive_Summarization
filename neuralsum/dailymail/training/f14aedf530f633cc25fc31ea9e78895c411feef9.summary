by @entity0 published : 10:31 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 11:25 est , 17 september 2012 a senior @entity3 manager was sacked after she sent ' extreme ' emails to her married lover that discussed her use of sex toys and suggesting a drunken romp on a desk , a tribunal heard			1
she sent the stream of explicit notes from her work account at @entity14 , and her employers found out and dismissed her			1
the manager , who can not be named for legal reasons , is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination , despite sending emails about masturbating and even having a ‘ treasure hunt ’ on her breasts			1
sacked : @entity22 , pictured , sacked the woman after discovering the string of explicit emails sent from her work account @entity26 , for @entity14 , said her actions were completely inappropriate , telling the tribunal : ' the emails talk of sex in what i would describe as extreme language			1
this is not a building site culture but this is a refined culture of an @entity3 trust			2
' it ’s not an invitation to coffee			2
it ’s not an invitation for dinner , it ’s not even ‘ i love you ’ - it goes far beyond that			2
' the woman admitted the affair and emails to her boss last july after the man ’s scorned wife threatened to turn up at @entity14 for an angry showdown			1
during a flurry of emails sent between her and the man on april 14 last year the woman suggested a boozy tryst in her office , saying : ' want to meet ? i ’m very drunk			1
' earlier on she had told the man of what she had spent the evening talking about , including ‘ my attraction ... my unhappiness and how to make a love affair last forever			2
’ she then added : ‘ and on second bottle			2
’ another foul - mouthed message sent by the woman two days later unleashed a tirade of abuse against an unidentified person , who she described as a ‘ complete f * * * * * * w * * * * * of a t * * * pot c * * * of a b * * * * * *			1
’ she sent an email to the man on may 4 last year saying : “ i ’m so tempted to call you and have a conversation about w * * * * * * , stockings and breasts			2
' ' extreme ' : the woman , who ca n't be named for legal reasons , sent the notes on the night she feared her lover 's wife might confront her in other messages sent the same evening she talked of how ‘ i want to be a bloke clearly ! ’ to which her lover replied ‘ it is great having a penis			1
’ this prompted the woman to fire off another pair of raunchy emails			1
in one she said : ' must be great to w * * * easily , wee standing up when out in a wood , and have something to play with when bored			2
' ten minutes later she sent another email to the man saying : ' i am serious			0
i ’ve decided that as i can make my own decisions , buy furniture and put it together [ as long as it does n’t have doors ] and financially support myself , i have no need for a man at all - except physically			0
' so if i get a rabbit [ sex toy ] , plus the skills to use it , i wo n’t need one at all			1
but seriously , a penis is so easy for self - pleasuring - you are lucky			0
i ’d do it all the time if i was you			0
' the pair returned to the sex chat a fortnight later and indulged in a conversation about playing an x-rated ‘ treasure hunt			1
’ it began after the woman sent an email on june 17 last year saying : ' i am now up and heading out			1
been looking at my breasts for a while			0
not sure about them with the tan line			0
( i bet you have no idea what to say to that )			0
' the man replied : ' i ’m sure the tan line on your breasts will be fine			0
i assume you used my advice and wore the blue plasters over your nipples and that is your tan line			0
that would be great , it would be like a treasure hunt			0
' soon after she sent an excited email saying : ' that ’s so funny - @entity152 marks the spot ! may need to put criss - cross blue plasters in another location if that works			0
“ certain ” men need all the help they can get			0
' fancy playing pirates then ? ! ' during closing submissions at @entity164 the woman said : ' no policy states that email use is gross misconduct			1
the policies on email are confusing in any event			0
' she also said she had been discriminated against for being a woman as her lover had not faced the same disciplinary procedure because he worked for a separate company			1
judgement on the case has been reserved until a later date .			0

@entity14 saw the ' extreme ' emails and sacked her
the woman , who ca n't be named , sent them when she though the wife of her lover would turn up to confront them at work
she is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination , but the *hospital* say she *deserved* to be fired
