dental kits which allow people to carry out their own fillings and repair caps and crowns at home are on the rise as patients say they ca n't afford a visit to the dentist			1
the kits , which can cost as little as £ 5 or even be bought in pound shops , are intended to provide a temporary solution for lost fillings or broken caps and crowns			1
however , more and more people are said to be buying the kits to carry out their own dental work as the price of receiving filling by a @entity22 dentist in @entity23 is as much as £ 52			1
more and more people suffering from dental problems are turning to @entity27 dentistry kits due to the price of @entity22 dental treatment ( picture posed by model ) according to the @entity32 , one of the biggest sellers of first aid dental kits is @entity36 , who sell around 250,000 products a year , although there is no research on how they are used			1
among the items they sell are a temporary filling material as well as cap and crown cement			2
and although @entity49 figures show that more people than ever are receiving dental treatment on the @entity22 , experts are pointing to anecdotal evidence , which suggests that @entity27 dentistry is on the rise			1
@entity55 , a professor of health economics at @entity57 told the newspaper : ' people at the lower end of the distribution curve - on big housing estates in the north - east , for instance - are effectively completely unreported			0
one of the @entity65 kits that can be bought to provide a temporary filling or repair a cap ' they do n't take part in surveys and they do n't go to gp surgeries			2
which is why you have a situation where people in the north - east have gaps in their teeth and are resorting to @entity27 dentistry			1
' meanwhile others have pointed to the fact that in certain parts of @entity23 registering with an @entity22 dentist can be difficult due to huge waiting lists			0
an investigation last year found that some people were being forced to register with surgeries up to 40 miles from their home as nearby practices were refusing to take - on new patients			0
it also found that some @entity22 dental surgeries can have waiting lists of up to two years			0
the rise of the @entity27 kits come as @entity96 revealed last year that one in five people admitted they would carry out @entity27 dentistry , including pulling out their own teeth , because they ca n't afford to go to the dentist			1
their survey found that 17 per cent of people would remove their own tooth and that almost 80 per cent of those asked would leave a problem with their teeth until they could afford a dental appointment			2
the foundation also warned about ' senseless ' examples of people pulling out the wrong tooth and ending up with infections after resorting to using doorknobs and string to yank out painful and infected teeth			0
dr @entity117 , chief executive of the @entity96 , said : ' diy dentistry is both dangerous and unnecessary			0
there are too many senseless examples of people either pulling out the wrong tooth or ending up with an infection			0
' it is all too easy to make the problem worse , which could result in more invasive and expensive treatment			0
