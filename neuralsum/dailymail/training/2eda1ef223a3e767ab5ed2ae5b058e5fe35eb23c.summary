the number of pensioners dying from hypothermia has nearly doubled in five years , a period when a succession of cold winters has been coupled with drastic rises in energy bills			1
the official figures emerged after several days of @entity10 conditions which drove temperatures across the whole country as low as minus @entity14 ( @entity15 )			2
they showed that 1,876 patients were treated in hospital for hypothermia in 2010/11 , up from 950 in 2006/07			1
a succession of cold winters and a rise in energy prices has left many pensioners shivering the number of sufferers who died within 30 days of admission shot up from 135 to 260			1
three - quarters of victims were pensioners , with cases soaring among the over- 60s more than any other age group			1
the increasing toll of hypothermia over the past five years coincides with a surge in energy costs , especially gas prices which have gone up by 40 per cent			1
soaring energy bills are pushing more and more pensioners into fuel poverty , forcing them to choose between heating and eating			1
one industry analyst , @entity43 , estimates that eight in ten households are already rationing their energy use and have called for a cut in @entity47 on power bills			1
the row over energy prices is poised to be reignited later this month when the ' big six ' energy companies reveal their latest profit figures			1
campaign groups said yesterday it was ' scandalous ' that pensioners in modern @entity55 could be suffering from hypothermia			2
@entity57 of @entity58 urged the government to take more action to protect those at risk of freezing to death			1
' we like to think of ourselves as a civilised society which protects the most vulnerable , ' she said			0
' the fact that there are still older people who are suffering and dying of hypothermia is deeply shocking			2
' a survey carried out by @entity58 last month found that half of pensioners have turned their heating down to save money even when they are not warm enough			1
many more are so cold they go to bed when they are not tired or move into one room to keep energy bills down			2
hypothermia occurs when body temperature drops below @entity81 ( @entity82 ) from its normal @entity83 ( @entity84 )			2
symptoms can include violent shivering , confusion , delirium and unconsciousness			0
three - quarters of hypothermia victims are pensioners , with cases soaring among the over- 60s temperatures plummeted in the @entity58 putting thousands of pensioners living in fuel poverty at risk the cold weather hit this residential street in @entity100 , @entity101 , last week where snow covered cars and left the roads treacherous energy prices have shot up in the last five years leaving eight out of 10 homes rationing their fuel , according to research the statistics from the @entity110 show that three - quarters of hypothermia cases are among the over- 60s , and the increase in admissions has been the highest among this age group			1
in 2006/07 , there were 633 hypothermia admissions among the over- 60s , rising to 1,396 in 2010/11			2
this is a rise of 120 per cent			0
there have , however , been increases across all age groups			0
among adults aged 15 to 59 , cases have risen by 54 per cent to 276			0
there were 50 hypothermia cases among children aged 14 and under , a 22 per cent increase			0
public health minister @entity130 said the government has put plans in place to tackle the number of cold weather deaths the figures on deaths are not broken down by age , but show that almost 20 per cent of those admitted die within 30 days			1
a further 6 per cent die between 30 and 90 days from admission			2
meanwhile , taking inflation into account , the price of gas has increased by 40 per cent in the last five years to 3.4p per kilowatt hour			0
electricity prices have risen by 21 per cent to 11.8p per kilowatt hour			0
this has led to a surge in the number of pensioners in ' fuel poverty ' , which means the costs of energy bills make up more than 10 per cent of the household budget			1
age @entity58 says that more than three million older people in @entity157 – nearly 1.2million of whom live alone – are in fuel poverty			1
this total is a quarter of all pensioners and has trebled since 2003			2
the elderly receive cold weather payments if the temperature falls below a certain level , but campaigners argue that the money is clearly not enough to stave off hypothermia in many cases			0
the parent companies of @entity55 's big six energy firms are expected to announce total profits of £ 15billion in the next few weeks , although @entity58 consumers only contribute a small part of these profits as far as at least four of these firms are concerned – @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity180 ( @entity179 ) and @entity181 ( @entity182 )			1
@entity183 , the energy regulator , says the average profit per customer in @entity55 was £ 100 last month but could fall in the summer months to £ 70			0
@entity186 of the @entity187 described the expected profits figure as ' scandalous '			0
he said : ' it is a graphic example of the failure to protect some of our most vulnerable individuals			0
' last night public health minister @entity130 said : ' we have introduced a @entity195 to reduce the number of deaths			0
we have also set up a @entity198 and @entity199 of £ 30million to pay for local authority projects to reduce effects of cold weather			0
' @entity203 is also providing professionals and the public with updates and practical advice from the chief medical officer			0
' the @entity209 said the main cause of excess winter deaths was not hypothermia but heart and respiratory disease .			0
