the @entity0 is just 16 days away and excitement is building			1
each week our man in @entity4 , @entity2 , brings us the latest news and views from @entity7 - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the @entity0 in @entity4 is shaping up			1
' yes , [ money ] is one of the reasons			2
i 'm 59 and i do n't want to work as a coach until i 'm 70			2
i want to retire in four or five years			0
' those words were uttered in june 2008 , which , assuming our maths are right here , means @entity22 never got his wish			1
four and five years have come and gone , a sixth is well upon him and the now 65 - year - old is about as far removed from the peace and tranquility of retirement as he could ever have imagined			0
the lush green of @entity31 in the hillside surrounds of @entity33 , ironically , can be a very serene place when it wants to be			0
in the middle of it all stood @entity22 , the flame to which these myriad moths were drawn			1
@entity4 's first day in @entity0 camp is a pretty big deal every four years but this time round they take on the world on home turf with 200 million pairs of eyes staring down on them in heavy hope and enormous expectation			1
but @entity74 cut a comfortable figure , one who is exactly where he wants to be			0
retirement ? you 've got to be kidding			0
to be fair , buying the winnebago and seeing a bit more of the world with his wife @entity83 were n't the only things that did n't go to the plan @entity22 laid out back in june 2008			1
those comments were made at a press conference that came in the middle of @entity90 when the 2002 @entity0 winner was confirmed as @entity93 's replacement as @entity95 manager			1
high hopes : @entity22 greets @entity4 's biggest talent @entity97 to their @entity0 training base this week objection : a handful of protestors also met the players , upset at the sums of money spent on the @entity0 he did n't take up the role and that lucrative three - year deal until a month later but it was all over within another seven months			1
it was a short spell marked with a long list of failings			0
signings , @entity114 the prime example , never quite clicked , there were fallings out with senior players and tactical breakdowns aplenty			0
but more than anything , succeeding two men - @entity93 and @entity121 - who had been unbeaten at home and going on to drop 16 of 39 points at @entity124 did it for @entity22			1
it was an episode that scarred @entity22 , not just big in nickname but in character and confidence too			1
being viewed as unable to cut it in the @entity131 cut him deep			0
after all , this is a man who has been at the helm in three major tournaments that also featured @entity137			0
he knocked them out of all three - the 2002 and 2006 @entity140 and @entity141 in between - before being denied the opportunity to continue the streak when the @entity144 failed to qualify for @entity90			0
never mind @entity145 or @entity146 , @entity22 is the new @entity147			1
hard times : @entity22 is still hurt by the memories of failing to succeed during his time as @entity95 manager so there is no little irony that here he is now , 12 months past the appointed retirement date eyeing history and relying heavily on sources of that painful experience			2
bidding to become only the second man in history - and the first since 1938 - to win two @entity140 as manager , @entity22 is leaning on the league which burned him so badly , taking six @entity131 players home for action and summoning four of his 23 from @entity95			2
as for @entity121 , the old foe whose shadow he could n't escape at @entity166 and who he fell out with more than once when he was @entity168 coach and the upstart was working his early magic at @entity171 , @entity22 has a lot to thank him for			2
benefactor : @entity22 has benefited from @entity121 's ( right ) improving of @entity175 and @entity176 at @entity95 in deconstructing and casting afresh @entity175 into the relentless , all action talent he became this past season , while also tinkering and finessing the approach of @entity176 , there is a mark of @entity121 in @entity74 's retooled @entity39 , unlikely as @entity22 is to ever acknowledge it			1
however , he has mellowed , he has changed			0
at @entity31 he welcomed his squad almost like a father or at the very least close family			0
there was little of the past headmaster , more jolly uncle			0
new traits have blended easily though with the old reliables - most crucially , loyalty			0
@entity22 will largely stick with his tried and trusted @entity192 winners in the bid for home glory			2
there has been some trademark luck too , not a single major injury in the build - up , while opening night opponents @entity199 will have their leader of the line @entity203 suspended			0
they are the kind of early breaks that can shape a path to glory , that can at the very least help build confidence			0
' in @entity4 we only have one option , ' said @entity22 earlier this month			1
' retirement can sure as hell wait			0
high hopes : @entity22 says the @entity4 public only has one outcome in its mind for the @entity0 : winning @entity219 's huge - money swapping of @entity220 for @entity221 has kicked off a financial frenzy involving @entity4 defensive talent			1
@entity44 looks certain to join the former @entity95 man at @entity225 with @entity226 going in the opposite direction to @entity228			1
meanwhile , not be left out , @entity229 picked up a win and goal - scoring bonus in the @entity233 final			1
we guess the drinks are on the defenders at @entity4 camp			1
winner : @entity4 's @entity229 scores in the @entity233 final victory for @entity240 over @entity241 @entity4 does music as well as it does football			1
pretty damn good in other words			0
it 's little surprise then that the host nation have proved harsh judges of the official song of the @entity0			1
@entity4 's assessment of we are one has been withering on a @entity254 scale			1
rightly so , the ditty trundled out by @entity37 , @entity36 and native daughter @entity256 is truly awful and about as @entity4 as a stadium finished on time			1
its stock is so low that the locals would be happy enough to just rehash an old tune with # @entity263 becoming a trending hashtag here in the hope that @entity267 's anthem for @entity268 can be brought back in place of @entity36 and co. @entity4 is ' one ' alright , united in turning the volume down			1
party time : @entity36 ( left ) , @entity37 and @entity256 perform the @entity274 song on stage unison : @entity36 and @entity37 's @entity0 song @entity278 has been canned by the @entity4 public star performers : @entity36 and @entity256 during recording of their @entity0 song we are one some @entity4 imports came and made the @entity131 their own ( @entity288 , @entity289 ) , some did n't quite ( @entity284 and @entity285 at the head of that queue )			1
@entity290 falls somewhere between the two but that 's not say there were n't spectacular moments during his three seasons at @entity124			2
the @entity0 winning full - back scored some screamers in his time at @entity95 's and came to mind this week after @entity229 bundled in @entity240 's third against @entity241 in the @entity233 final			1
the last @entity4 to score on @entity301 football 's biggest night was none other than @entity290 , who broke @entity304 hearts with the winner in the 2006 decider			1
three years retired , he works as an analyst for @entity309 in his homeland			0
remember me ? former @entity95 defender @entity290 is now working for @entity4 tv ' we believe we are heading in the right direction			2
we have two more games in @entity4 and all these games are designed for us to be ready for the first game against @entity318			2
' @entity320 coach @entity319 after his side 's sterile 1 - 1 draw with @entity323 on monday			2
the @entity324 will be the first team to arrive in @entity4 when they get here on wednesday , a full 11 days before @entity137			2
dropped into a group with @entity327 and @entity328 , as well as @entity318 , they probably should make the most of their pre-tournament time			0
they 're unlikely to hang around too long after kick - off			0
@entity334 released their stadium food and drink prices yesterday and while fans jetting in from @entity301 or @entity320 may be pleasantly surprised to find that , by home standards , they 'll be far from fleeced once inside any of the 12 host arenas , the same ca n't be said for locals			0
being asked to shell out r $ 6 ( £ 1.60 ) for a small local beer ( a large is £ 2.70 , a large @entity343 £ 3.50 ) is hardly going to burst many budgets but being asked for r $ 6 for a 500ml water when any corner store in @entity4 sells 1.5litre bottles for less than a quarter of the @entity334 price smacks of good old - fashioned opportunism			2
maybe just get plenty of @entity351 onboard before coming through the turnstiles			0
big prices : the @entity4 public has reacted badly to @entity334 's high prices for food and drink inside stadiums june rolls around this weekend which means only one thing in the world 's biggest rainforest - winter is here			1
but do n't wheel out the gloves and snoods just yet because the relentless heat is not ready to give way in @entity366			0
highs of @entity368 will persist all week with lows ( @entity137 fans might feel ' slightly less highs ' is a better term ) of @entity373			0
consider this , stadium volunteers plucked from the local community complained of feeling ill after training runs in the heat in recent days			0
if that 's the toll it is taking on the locals , blow - ins may be better off staying indoors .			2

@entity39 boss @entity22 is set to walk away from management after the @entity0
he says there is only one option for @entity4 's @entity0 fortunes : ' winning '
the @entity4 public is in unison in its *dislike* of the official @entity0 song we are one from @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity256
@entity4 defenders @entity219 , @entity44 and @entity226 all look set to be on the move shortly
fellow @entity4 @entity229 scored in @entity240 's @entity233 triumph on the weekend
