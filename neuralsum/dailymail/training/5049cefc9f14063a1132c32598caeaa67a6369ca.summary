@entity41 : @entity9 said @entity15 deserved to stay , and she drew a gasp of sympathy from the audience when she said that it the ' viewers have decided it was time ' for her to go , then that was fair enough when asked what his @entity5 highlight had been , @entity9 said : ' there have been many			1
there has been a lot , a lot of highlights			1
i ’ve really enjoyed myself			1

it was n't your best dance , but you did your best			2
' even @entity105 was n't keen , adding : ' it ’s harsh what the judges are saying but some of it is true			0
i just think this dance exposes you , because i do think you excel better in ballroom			0
' ' i know you ’re working hard and i know you ’re trying , and i commend you for that , but i just do n’t think @entity115 – and this particular dance – suited you ' defying her years : 62 - year - old @entity15 's performance last night had youthful energy @entity120 : even though husband @entity121 was in the audience , @entity15 did not hold back with partner @entity14 @entity15 and @entity14 performed the same dance as top scorers @entity124 and @entity126 , with their @entity127 getting 33			0

great job ! ' , while @entity78 told him he was ' becoming a smooth operator '			0

their electric performance on @entity5 tonight also tipped the leaderboard with an impressive 37 out of 40			1
however , a certain young lady might not be too happy about this particular routine			0
earlier this week , the @entity165 drummer revealed girlfriend @entity166 was so riled by his dirty dancing that she gave him the silent treatment			0
passionate : @entity169 told @entity124 and @entity155 their performance was ' filth ' he said : ' when she ( @entity172 ) came to watch us practice the tango , @entity155 warned her that it was raunchy			0
