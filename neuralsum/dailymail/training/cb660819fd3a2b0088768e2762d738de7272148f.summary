by @entity0 last updated at 11:57 pm on 9th january 2012 the battle for @entity3 ’s living rooms intensified yesterday with the @entity3 launch of film - rental service @entity5			2
the @entity8 firm offers subscribers a library of thousands of movies and tv programmes that can be streamed over the internet to televisions , computers or smartphones for just £ 5.99 a month			1
in comparison , @entity17 charges £ 16 a month for its bundle of movie channels , while @entity21 charges £ 21.50			1
the fees come on top of basic subscription packages for set - top boxes and tv channels			0
how you can use @entity5 to watch movies @entity5 could pose a threat to both companies , as well as other internet services such as @entity32 , which is owned by @entity33			2
films from @entity5 ( and @entity32 ) are available to watch on computers , tablets , smartphones and newer internet - enabled televisions , and can also be streamed on normal tvs through an @entity42 or @entity41 games console			2
@entity5 customers can watch in their living rooms using a @entity45 or @entity48 ’s @entity47 set - top box , too			2
the launch could put further pressure on @entity3 ’s broadband infrastructure , which may struggle to cope if @entity5 becomes a hit			0

@entity5 ’s success in the @entity8 – where it accounts for about a third of internet use – has led to some internet service providers capping their customer ’s usage , or introducing higher charges for heavy users			0
the future of on - demand streaming services in the @entity3 will largely depend on which films and tv programmes they can secure the rights to			0
@entity5 , which already has 20million subscribers worldwide , should have enough financial muscle to build its business in @entity3			0
it has signed digital licensing deals with the @entity80 and @entity105 studios such as @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , and is offering potential customers a free one - month trial			1
