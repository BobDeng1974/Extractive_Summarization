@entity2 , whose clients included @entity12 , sir @entity10 ’s daughter @entity13 , and members of the @entity17 royal family , clasped his hands over his heart as the jury of six men and six women unanimously rejected charges that he had preyed on women at his upmarket spa			1
outside court he embraced his wife , @entity27 , who had supported him throughout his arrest and trial after telling friends in their native @entity31 that she believed the charges were ‘ completely insane ’			2
his solicitor said the couple were ‘ relieved ’ at the outcome			2
she added : ‘ mr @entity2 has always maintained his innocence and is pleased to have at last been vindicated			1
’ miss @entity27 , who would have been only yards away when the alleged offences took place , said : ‘ i have never had any doubts in his professionalism or his work			2
‘ i ’ve never , never seen anything that gave me even the smallest concern that something was n’t right			2
’ mr @entity2 , 35 , was said to have intimately touched the women as he massaged them at the @entity46 and @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49			1
the first allegation was made by a former employee of sir @entity10 in december 2009 as she visited the clinic the day before he was due to give a massage to the @entity54			2
the case was dropped after the woman declined to pursue it , but two years later he was re-arrested after new allegations were made			2
police subsequently sent a letter to all his female clients , and he was eventually charged with 21 offences of alleged sexual assault against 18 women			1
prosecutors claimed his victims included a teenage girl who visited the clinic for a 17th birthday treat , a music producer and two lawyers			2
relief : mr @entity2 with his wife and solicitor @entity73			1
he bowed to the jury before leaving the dock after his five - week trial but mr @entity2 was cleared after telling @entity3 how he would have been ‘ insane ’ to have assaulted the women as his wife , who co-owned the spa , worked in a nearby room			1
a string of clients testified in the masseur ’s favour and he was described by some as providing the ‘ perfect ’ service			2
his neighbour , @entity89 survivor @entity88 , called him ‘ a moral pillar in the community ’			0
arm in arm : the couple head home jurors also heard that he was said to have a ‘ magic touch ’ and other clients believed he had ‘ healing hands			1
’ friends and even his ex-wife in his homeland told the @entity104 they never believed the charges			0
mr @entity2 , who speaks three languages and is the son of a @entity31 army officer , was known by friends and family as a ‘ golden boy ’ who charmed people wherever he went			1
in 2002 he took a job at a five - star hotel in @entity116 , where he met @entity117 , a flamboyant @entity31 fashion designer			0
the pair struck up a friendship and the designer invited mr @entity2 to travel to @entity121 to be a personal aide to his partner , @entity124 professor @entity123 , who had terminal cancer			1
mr @entity2 returned to @entity116 in 2003 where he met @entity127 , whom he married following a whirlwind romance lasting two months			1
she described him as a ‘ perfect gentleman ’ who swept her off her feet with his elegant manners and the stories of his glamorous life mixing with a-list stars that he met through his work			0
she said : ‘ he was a real smooth talker and told me about how many stars he knew			0
he said he was close to @entity142 and other celebrities			0
‘ he was determined to get into that celebrity world			0
he felt he was a nobody and he wanted to be a somebody			0
he had a hunger to be close to stars			0
i think he saw giving massages as getting as close as he could to famous people			0
’ the couple split after only four months , but she said : ‘ @entity2 never did anything to make me think he could hurt or abuse a woman			1
he was a very caring man			0
’ the month after his first marriage ended , mr @entity2 met miss @entity27 , who was then a law student			1
he also began working at the @entity156 beauty salon in central @entity49 , where the owner , @entity157 , said he often boasted about the celebrities he knew			0
she said : ‘ he said he knew @entity159			0
on another occasion he went to a charity event where he said he met @entity162			0
’ she said he hoped that @entity163 would let him give a massage to then @entity121 football manager , @entity165 , in the hope of becoming the masseur to the @entity121 football team			0
claims dismissed : one of mr @entity2 's accusers was a former employee of sir @entity10 ( pictured here with wife @entity173 ) who alleged the masseur touched her intimately during an appointment after the death of his parents in 2006 , mr @entity2 settled permanently in @entity49 , where miss @entity27 joined him after completing her degree			1
in 2008 they bought the @entity46 spa and built up a client list of around 800			1
after they married in 2010 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i love @entity4 so much , i would give her my life , everything			1
’ by @entity104 reporter published : 08:05 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 19:59 est , 14 june 2012 support : miss @entity27 leaving @entity3 during the trial , which she attended every day after giving evidence defending her husband it was described as the ‘ @entity194 ’ trial			0
the evidence given against @entity2 by 18 women was so similar that the case was likened to the @entity199 movie in which a man lives the same day over and over again			1
but the same could also be said of the string of happy female clients who queued up to speak in the masseur ’s favour at @entity3 , eventually leading to him being cleared yesterday			0
many of the women who appeared for the prosecution were middle - class professionals who had paid only £ 26 for their treatments thanks to a cut - price website voucher which offered ‘ a unique massage combining ancient and modern techniques ’ at his clinic			1
a treat that would usually cost £ 110 promised that mr @entity2 would leave them ‘ relaxed , rejuvenated , full of life and raring to go ’			1
but the women would go on to claim at the trial that the relaxing massages had a sinister undertone			2
one , who bought the massage for herself and a friend as a birthday treat , claimed mr @entity2 went too far and told the court : ‘ i felt a kind of shock that this was happening			1
’ she added : ‘ i just felt i should get out of there as quickly as possible			0
’ a 17 - year - old girl , whose mother had bought her a massage voucher as a birthday gift , said she was left ‘ really confused ’ after an all - over body scrub			0
another patient , a married businesswoman in her fifties , said she could hardly believe the masseur would be ‘ interested ’ in her because had a ‘ beautiful ’ young wife upstairs			0
but @entity242 , @entity243 , defending , claimed that at least five of the 18 witnesses had given accounts that had ‘ grown with the telling ’			2
she argued the evidence given in court by those women was different from the accounts they had originally given to the police			2
others had not reported any form of sexual assault until they were contacted by detectives investigating mr @entity2 , she said			1
‘ this is a man who has worked extremely hard , and the two things that mattered most to him were his wife and getting on in his work , ’ she said			0
an opinion which yesterday the jurors were more than happy to accept .			0
