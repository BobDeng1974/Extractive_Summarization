by @entity0 it 's common knowledge that medication can cause unwanted side effects , from headaches to rashes and cramps			0
but one woman got more than she bargained for when trying to ease her symptoms of @entity10 's - up to five spontaneous orgasms a day			2
the 42 - year - old had been diagnosed with an early - onset form of the disease , triggered by a lack of the chemical dopamine in the brain			1
seven days after being prescribed the drug rasagiline , the woman began suffering hyperarousal like many @entity10 's patients , she was prescribed the drug rasagiline which increases dopamine levels , therefore helping to relieve symptoms such as tremor , stiffness and slow movement			1
well - known side effects include headache , flu - like symptoms , feeling dizzy , constipation and dry mouth			0
but after seven days , the @entity35 woman began experiencing rather more unusual ones - hyperarousal and increased libido , @entity33 reports			1
this was triggering three to five orgasms a day , lasting between five and 20 seconds each time			1
by the 10th day , the woman was so distressed , she was admitted to hospital			2
in a case report , to be published in the journal @entity44 and @entity45 , the doctors who treated her wrote : ' to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of this adverse effect of rasagiline			0
' why the spontaneous orgasms occurred is n't clear - but one theory is the raised levels of dopamine that rasagiline causes the woman had not been taking any other medication , and she did not experience any other bizarre symptoms related to the use of the drug , according to the report from the medics at the department of neurology at @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity35			1
when she stopped taking the drug , the symptoms stopped			0
but the orgasms began again 15 days later when she resumed the course , forcing her to abandon it			2
it 's not clear why the spontaneous orgasms occurred - but one theory is the raised levels of dopamine that rasagiline causes			2
this is because dopamine is a neurotransmitter that activates the body 's reaction to sexual pleasure , the researchers say			0
in their case report , they mention another bizarre case concerning the drug - a man who suffered from spontaneous ejaculation			0
the episodes continued even when the dose of rasagiline dropped by half , but stopped when the 65 - year - old ceased taking the drug			1
he also reported a better sex life when he did want to have intercourse , according to the report in the journal @entity99 .			0

42 - year - old @entity35 woman had been prescribed the drug rasagiline
but seven days after she began taking it experienced ' hyperarousal '
by day 10 , was having five orgasms a day of between five and 20 seconds
rasagiline increases levels of chemical dopamine in the brain
this is linked with pleasure - and may be reason for heightened arousal
