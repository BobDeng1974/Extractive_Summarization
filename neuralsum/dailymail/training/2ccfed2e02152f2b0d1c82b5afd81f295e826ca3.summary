by @entity0 in a dazzling blaze of orange and black , three of the world 's rarest tigers dash in to the outside world for the first time - after they were born in a @entity8 zoo			1
the @entity10 cubs - two females and a male - are the first baby tigers to be born at @entity14 near @entity15 , @entity16 , in more than 20 years			1
playing in the great outdoors and nuzzling up to their proud mother , the eight - week - old infants add to a world population of the critically endangered species , which is estimated to be as low as 400			1
leap of faith : sumatran tiger cub @entity23 bounds off a rock in his enclosure at @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 after being let outside for the first time lying on her side in the long grass , proud mother @entity29 tenderly licks one of her eight - week - old @entity35 tiger cubs as it nuzzles up to her at an enclosure easy does it : one of the eight - week - old tiger cubs thinks about leaping off a rock as its mother watches			1
the young animals are still very much in their infancy and are still dependent on their mother zoo manager @entity46 has spoken of his pride at the popular zoo attraction helping to bring about a near one per cent increase in the species ’ numbers			2
mr @entity46 said : ' it was a fantastic feeling when the cubs were born , a real sense of joy			0
' as a zoo , it does n’t get much better than breeding a critically endangered species			0
this is what we are here for			0

at the moment they weigh just seven kilos on the prowl : eight - week - old @entity72 explores her enclosure having been allowed out			0
the expected lifespan of its mother and father is around 20 years - in the wild average life expectancy for the species is just four years eyes burning bright , @entity29 closely guards one of her @entity35 tiger cubs , @entity66 , as the pair prowl through the thick grass of their enclosure @entity23 bounds across a gap in the rocks			1
the cubs are expected to be the future of the @entity92 breeding programme for the critically endangered species with only their heads visible and their bodies concealed by the long grass , mother and cub enjoy the spring weather at @entity14 in @entity101 , @entity16 according to the @entity103 , there are now fewer than 400 @entity35 tigers left in the wild			1
the tiger subspecies is classed as ' critically endangered ' and they are holding on for survival in remaining patches of forest on the island of @entity112			0
conservationists blame dwindling numbers on increased deforestation as well as continued poaching and the twin threats have sparked fears they could end up extinct			2
although they are protected by law in @entity121 , with tough sentences handed out for poaching and heavy fines , there is still a ' substantial ' market for tiger parts and products within @entity112 and wider @entity128			0
sumatran tigers weigh between 156 and 308 pounds and typically live in tropical areas of forest as well as peat swamp and freshwater swamp habitats			0
' this has been seven years in the making and we are very proud to have delivered three healthy cubs			0
' the cubs - born on march 22 to mother @entity29 and father @entity140 - were released into their outside enclosure for the very first time			1
at just eight weeks old , they are still very much in their infancy and still dependent on their mother for food			0
@entity29 lies in the shade while one of her cubs bounds over its sibling in a playful scene			0
the cubs ' parents arrived at @entity14 in 2010 in the hope that they would produce offspring one of the cubs receives a big lick from its proud mother as the pair relax in the grass			2
at this stage they are still feeding from their mother but over the last few weeks have learnt to move independently @entity167 and @entity168 find some trees and rocks to explore as they get their first taste of the great outdoors having been born in march mr @entity46 added : ' the cubs are still tiny compared to the size they will grow to and only weigh around seven kilos			2
' at this stage they are still feeding from their mother but over the last few weeks have learnt to move independently and they are now all very active			0
' the cubs ’ parents arrived at @entity14 in 2010 in the hope that they would produce offspring as part of a worldwide conservation effort to save the @entity10 from extinction			2
@entity29 and @entity167 adopt the same position and look out in the same direction at their @entity14 enclosure			0
the world population of @entity10 is as low as 400 pictured left walking along a ridge , one of the eight - week - old cubs surveys its options as it takes a stroll outside for the first time			1
but another cub prefers to stay under the watchful eye of its mother @entity29 in the long grass mr @entity46 added : ' these cubs are now the future of the @entity92 breeding programme			1
' in 18 months time they could be transferred anywhere in @entity92 and hopefully paired with a suitable mate to continue the breeding process			2
' the average life expectancy of @entity35 tigers in the wild is only four years , but the expected lifespan of @entity29 and @entity140 is more than 20 years .			1

fewer than 400 @entity35 tigers are believed to exist in the world with poaching and deforestation the *key* threats
three cubs have now been born in *captivity* in an enclosure at @entity14 , near @entity15 in @entity16
their birth eight weeks *ago* in march has swelled the global population of the species by nearly one per cent
the animals , allowed outside for the first time , are seen as a *crucial* part of a breeding programme across @entity92
