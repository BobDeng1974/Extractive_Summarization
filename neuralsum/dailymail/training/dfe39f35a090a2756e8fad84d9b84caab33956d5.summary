@entity0 and @entity1 may both take the field on friday evening in the latest round of @entity5 matches			1
you can be sure both men will feature prominently in saturday morning ’s papers – more prominently , in fact , than the games in which they are scheduled to appear			0
the frisson will say something about their cricketing charisma , and perhaps a little more about the general absence of that quality elsewhere in @entity18 cricket			1
this is to take nothing away from @entity21 or @entity22 or even @entity23 ; doubtless @entity24 will rise again , and there is plenty of time for @entity28 to become the bums - on - seats merchant of @entity31 ’s middle order			1
getting ready to have a blast : @entity0 is set to play for @entity33 against @entity34 on friday but when the most attractive storylines of our domestic twenty20 tournament concern a player who last appeared five years ago , and another who has been cast aside by @entity31 after falling out with one power - broker too many , then you are entitled to wonder about the robustness of the game as a whole			1
a wider question arises here , and it sprung to mind almost as soon as @entity21 reverse - swept @entity47 for four at @entity48 on saturday			1
it was not so much the chutzpah of the stroke that stood out , as its statistical shock value : it was @entity31 ’s first boundary for almost 22 overs			0
what preceded it seemed to sum up the malaise : faced with a target of 300 , @entity58 and @entity59 – two highly promising players hailed as the present and the future – poked and prodded as if they were chasing 100 fewer			0
there is a wilful conservatism about @entity18 cricket , and now it was exposed for an hour - and - a - half by bowlers who would n’t know a coaching manual if it screamed in their face about getting side on and keeping their arm straight			1
had @entity21 taken @entity31 to victory , he would merely have provided the most glorious of glosses			1
what happened soon after confirmed that talk of a brave new era has to be seen for what it is			0
in the post-match press conference , @entity81 suggested @entity21 was n’t ‘ quite ready ’ for @entity84			1
bewilderingly , @entity21 himself agreed , adding : ‘ that is my honest opinion and that is the opinion of others			1
’ yet anyone who watched him flay @entity90 all over @entity48 may wonder when exactly he will be ready – and whether any other @entity84 nation would so quickly dampen the enthusiasm surrounding a player who has lit up @entity18 cricket during some of its darkest days			1
at least coach @entity97 did his best to salvage the situation on monday with some positive comments about @entity21 ’s chances of a test debut			1
but if @entity31 are worried about @entity21 ’s glovework , then they should remember how clumsy @entity104 was at the start of his @entity84 career			1
if they are worried about his batting technique , then they should stop regarding the glass as half - empty			0
this inherent caution has obviously extended to @entity21 ’s own sense of self - worth			1
thank goodness it has n’t yet impaired his batting			0
making a racket : @entity1 is in line to play for @entity116 on friday last week this column argued for the inclusion of @entity119 in the one - day team – but the public dilution of @entity21 ’s test prospects feels even more jarring			1
@entity18 cricket has rarely embraced unorthodoxy			1
even @entity1 , its most recent claimant to the noun , learned his game elsewhere before stating a case so undeniable that the selectors had to give way			2
but it seems perverse to hail the way ahead while falling into the same old pot - holes			0
back , though , to the @entity5			0
as @entity134 and @entity135 amassed 428 runs in last friday ’s @entity138 eliminator , @entity133 were busy inching their way to 117 for seven in their 20 overs against @entity116 at @entity142			2
to switch from @entity143 to @entity144 was to quit @entity145 for @entity146			0
and the difference between the two tournaments is about more than cash and the weirdly cadenced musings of @entity151			0
it is there in the attitude			0
during sunday ’s final in @entity157 , the @entity156 captain @entity155 gave a full quota of overs to a leg - spinner called @entity161 , who has played all of four first - class matches			2
@entity165 has his sights firmly set on @entity104 's place in the test side for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin @entity161 finished with four for 54 – and @entity156 failed to defend 200			2
but @entity155 had taken a chance and , as one batsman after another traded in a mix of sixes and miscues , it very nearly paid off			0
it was a gamble , it was beguiling , and it was the kind of decision few @entity18 captains would have dreamed of making			2
@entity182 and @entity1 should be fun to watch			2
but the enjoyment of pleasures past must n’t obscure the hunt for treasures future			0
eighteen months ago , in a wood - panelled back room at @entity189 , @entity187 casually insisted that @entity191 ’s first test series defeat at home to @entity31 in nearly three decades was n’t his most disappointing moment as captain			2
what then ? 0 - 4 in @entity31 ? 0 - 4 in @entity196 ? no. @entity187 opted instead for @entity191 ’s early exit from the 2007 @entity198 – a result that was as hurtful to sponsors and broadcasters as it was to the cricketers			0
and that set of priorities was evident again on friday , after @entity187 ’s @entity135 were beaten to a place in the @entity138 final by a @entity207 - inspired @entity134			1
@entity187 ’s mask slipped : his overseas players had been ‘ irresponsible ’ , he had ‘ belief in my bowling that they will definitely let them score over 200 runs ’ , and ‘ in our bowling attack also there is hardly any quick bowler who can push [ @entity207 ] onto the back foot ’			0
it ’s possible captain @entity220 has never been hotter under the collar – or more revealing of his priorities			2
@entity223 caused a stir by choosing to play for @entity225 instead of joining up with his @entity227 colleagues ahead of their three - @entity84 series at home to @entity230			2
regardless of the intransigence by the @entity235 board as they seek to apply their new ( and overdue ) ‘ @entity237 ’ policy , it was instructive to read @entity239 ’s assessment of his own @entity84 career in the @entity242			2
stretching himself a bit thin : @entity223 chose to play in the @entity138 rather than join up with @entity235 ‘ i am sure if i work hard at it and continue to get opportunities i will get better at bowling in that format , ’ said @entity223 , whose 21 test wickets have come at 40 apiece			1
‘ endurance and patience are the key in @entity84			0
’ and yet the question inevitably arises : how much does he really care ? figures in the @entity138 final of 4 - 0 - 46 - 1 – the joint - second-most expensive of his 126 - match @entity257 career – seemed like a dubious trade - off for missing a test series			1
at some point this summer , the cry will go up for @entity263 to return to the test team : it ’s hard to imagine @entity31 playing a five - match series against @entity191 without employing a front - line spinner , and @entity263 remains the best we have following the retirement of @entity270			0
but his latest skirmish with the authorities , this time after he forgot to turn up for an @entity273 team meeting , makes you wonder exactly where his mind is			1
@entity263 , over to you			0
watching brief : @entity263 on the balcony after being dropped by @entity273 for the match against @entity281 not everyone agrees that bowling actions which narrowly transgress the 15 degrees of flexion allowed by the regulations are necessarily bad for the game			0
but since the regulations are there , it seems strange that it has taken umpires so long to query @entity292 off - spinner @entity47 – which they duly did after saturday ’s fourth odi at @entity48			0
there is barely a more visible kink in world cricket			0
@entity300 : @entity90 's @entity47 has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action			1

@entity18 cricket is wilfully conservative despite talents such as @entity21
*excitement* surrounds @entity0 ( retired five years ago ) and @entity1
captain @entity308 getting hot under the collar
was @entity223 's *appearance* in @entity138 final worth missing @entity235 training ?
@entity263 's latest skirmish with the authorities
no *surprise* @entity47 's action is being *reviewed*
