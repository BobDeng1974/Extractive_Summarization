the number of children taken into care has hit a record 10,000 in one year			1
since the 2007 killing of @entity5 , there has been a huge surge in the number of youngsters being removed from their families by social workers			2
the children ’s court advisory service dealt with 10,199 cases between april 2011 and march 2012 – a near - doubling of the numbers in just four years			1
tragic case : since the 2007 killing of @entity5 , the number of youngsters being removed from their families by social workers has surged to record - breaking levels - reaching 10,199 in the past year alone it is the first time the body has received more than 10,000 referrals in a single year			1
the trend has raised fears that rising numbers of vulnerable children are being taken away from their families unnecessarily and consigned to languish in a care system that too often fails them			1
government statistics have shown children who spend years in care are more likely to leave school with barely any qualifications and fall into crime , drug abuse and prostitution			1
@entity36 , a charity which offers advice about social services , warned the care system was ‘ struggling to cope ’ with the rising numbers			1
chief executive @entity45 said : ‘ there are court delays , children being put in temporary placements or moved around with little notice , siblings are being split up and there is a significant shortage of foster carers			2
‘ @entity36 knows from the rising calls to its advice service and recent research that in some of these cases more could and should be done to have kept children safely with their family			1
’ the upturn in care referrals coincides with a decline in the number of adoptions , and charities said more needed to be done to speed up the adoption process			1
jailed : @entity5 was just 17 months old when he died at the hands of his mother , @entity66 , left , her violent partner @entity5 , centre , and his brother @entity69 , right , on august 3 , 2007 house of horror : the house in @entity73 , @entity74 , where @entity5 lived @entity5 , later named as @entity75 , was just 17 months old when he died in @entity74 , @entity76 , at the hands of his mother @entity77 , her violent partner @entity5 and his brother @entity69 on august 3 , 2007			2
he suffered more than 50 injuries despite being on the at - risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers , police and health professionals over an eight - month period			2
the number of children taken into care rose dramatically in the wake of the jailing of @entity75 ’s mother , @entity92 and @entity69 over his killing in november 2008			1
' more children are being protected ' : but @entity95 , chief executive of @entity96 , admitted social workers had ' panicked ' after the @entity5 case there was a further spike after a major review of the case was published in may the following year			1
but levels of referrals stayed high , and over the past year have shot up even faster			1
@entity96 , the agency which looks after children ’s interests in the family courts , said the number of care applications was 6,698 in 2002/03 – the first full year figures were collated			1
in 2007/08 , before full details of the @entity5 case had been made public , the figure stood at just 6,241			0
but by 2011/12 , it had soared to 10,199			1
local authorities in @entity116 made 886 care applications last month , just ten short of the highest figure ever recorded for march			1
january 2012 saw the highest ever number for a single month , with 912 referrals made			1
almost all applications result in the child being taken into care			1
the true figure for the number of children placed in care could be even higher , since each application can involve more than one child			1
@entity95 , chief executive of @entity96 , has previously suggested some of the surge in referrals has been unnecessary			1
speaking in late 2009 , he highlighted concerns over ‘ some agencies referring lower level concerns in case they make a mistake by under - reacting ’			0
‘ agencies must regain confidence in their own professional judgments and assessments			0
the @entity142 child protection system remains one of the safest in the world therefore that confidence is justified , ’ he said			1
yesterday he admitted social workers had ‘ panicked ’ but added : ‘ we do not believe the rise in care applications has been due to too much risk aversion on the part of practitioners			1
‘ just after the @entity5 serious case review was published [ in may 2009 ] , there was a lot of panic and a big spike in applications as a result of that panic			0
that atmosphere , however , is gone			0
‘ what has remained is the high level of intolerance of children living in these desperate situations and we have evidence that children are not being dragged into the system needlessly – more of them are being protected			1
’ the total being looked after by the state is more than 65,000			0
but social workers have been criticised for allowing youngsters to languish in children ’s homes or with rapidly - changing foster families			0
studies have shown that youngsters in the care of the state are significantly more likely to be expelled from school , gain few qualifications , fail to find work and suffer from mental health problems			2
ministers earlier this year unveiled a serious of measures aimed at breaking down barriers to adoptions , such as demands that adopters are of the same race , amid frustration at low levels of adoptions			2
according to social workers , child protection is now facing a ‘ major crisis ’			0
@entity197 , of the @entity198 , said soaring referrals combined with @entity201 cuts were preventing social workers doing their jobs properly			0
a study by the @entity204 found improvements in the detection of abuse and more consistent identification of dangers in the wake of the @entity5 case			0
the case was felt to be ‘ instrumental ’ in this			0
but the research also suggested a decline in parenting over the same period was also to blame			0
there was also evidence of ‘ defensive practice ’ among social workers			0
actress and director @entity221 , pictured , spent almost 18 years in care or living in foster homes			2
during her time in care she claimed she was physically abused , took class a drugs and almost ended up in jail after threatening to kill a girl who bullied her			1
she said she escaped a life addled by drugs and violence after being saved by television and drama at the age of 16			0
miss @entity221 , now 34 , was taken into care as a baby , began going to raves when she was 12 and dropped out of school at 13			2
in the past , the @entity239 star said : ‘ i came horribly , dangerously , massively close to not surviving			0
' my weakness – if you can call it that – was drugs			0
i took all sorts from a fairly young age , ecstasy and lsd among them			0
’ in 2009 miss @entity221 directed a film , @entity249 , based on her experiences			0
the film tells the story of a young girl in a @entity255 care home			2
in one scene , a 16 - yearold girl is sexually abused by an adult care worker			2
miss @entity221 said that the scene mirrored incidents in her own life			0
by numbers : the shocking statistics that show how the care system blights youngsters ' lives @entity267 , the @entity268 ’s head of strategy and development for looked - after children , added : ‘ while the continued high level of care applications looks dramatic , we must remember that the majority of children come into care as a result of abuse or neglect			1
‘ care provides a safe and supportive environment for these children			2
this continued rise could simply indicate people are being more alert to situations where children are at risk , which can only be a positive development			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity291 said : ‘ these decisions are never taken lightly – but the bottom line is that children ’s welfare must be paramount and they must be protected as early as possible from risk and abuse			0
‘ there is absolutely no evidence that children are being taken into care unnecessarily			2
we ’re investing £ 4billion nationally over two years in children services			0
we ’ve given local authorities complete freedom over their budgets so they can target children most at risk and protect them from harm			0
‘ it is a false economy for councils not to make this a priority – because society will pay much more further down the line if children do n’t get the support they need as early as possible			0
