@entity0 told how he was not feeling nervous about the wedding but would be more apprehensive about starting a family			1

he said : ' i 'm actually not nervous about getting married to be honest , we 've been together about nine and a half years so , we 've lived together for six , seven years as well so i do n't think a whole lots going to change			0
' i think i 'll be more nervous about starting a family because i feel like for me , that would be more life changing , in a good way but , i kind of feel we have been married already in the way we spend our lives together and live together so i 'm not that nervous about the day at all			1
' i 'm going to have a couple of best men			0
@entity2 's going to be one of them , @entity3 is also going to be a best man			1
' hopefully my good friend @entity47 from @entity48 , in @entity49			0
' the thing for me is it 's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because @entity9 has four bridesmaids and i was saying well , ' why is that fine for you ? ' ' imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you 've had since you were at school			2
it 's very difficult to chose one			0

i said , " no , it 's difficult , so i think i 'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come "			0

pictured : the @entity121 at the luxury hotel the hotel underwent an extensive redevelopment after it was bought by the tennis ace and re-opened last year where suites can go for up to £ 600 per night ' i was training in @entity48 , and my friend @entity47 , he was my best friend during that time , which were very important years of my life when i moved away from my family and my friends and he was the guy who was always there for me , he was my best friend though that period			2
' i feel like he knows extremely well from then , my brother knows me obviously since i was a child , and @entity3 over the last six or seven years , we 've become extremely close and we 've been through a lot together as well			0
' so , picking one was for me , a very , very difficult thing to do because i had three guys who were clearly my three best friends and i would like all of them to be involved in some way			0
