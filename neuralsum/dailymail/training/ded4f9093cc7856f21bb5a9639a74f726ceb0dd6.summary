by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 may be in full swing , but teams of robotic players are busy warming up to be in with a chance of lifting another trophy			2
the mechanical teams are set to battle it out on the pitch in a less well - known football tournament also taking place in @entity2 this summer			1
a group of five humanoid ‘ @entity14 ' robots will compete as a team at the @entity16 2014 , which kicks off in @entity17 on 21 july			1
it aims to promote robotics and artificial intelligence research			0
the official goal of the project is that by 2050 a team of fully autonomous humanoid football players will be able to compete against the most recent winning team of the real @entity35 - and comply to all of @entity37 's rules			1
there are five leagues in @entity16 soccer			2
one of them sees identical robots with differing software battling it out on the pitch , while those competing in the @entity46 - such as the robots from @entity48 - can look different			2
the competition will see teams from all over the world including the @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , battle it out over five leagues to see who is best on the field			0
the team from @entity59 is one of three to compete from the @entity61 , and the students ’ humanoid robots are made using cutting - edge technology			1
the robots have all - player tracking , a new inertial motion unit with which to navigate the pitch , as well as new gait design to help them manoeuvre and kick the ball with ease			0
they communicate with each other during games using @entity76			0
handball ! a team of five humanoid ' @entity14 ' robots ( pictured ) will compete as a team at @entity82 , which will kick off in @entity83 on 21 july hi - tech : the robots ( pictured ) have all - player tracking , a new inertial motion unit , new gait design and can communicate with each other during games using @entity76 while the team might not look exactly human , the robots do come with their own looks , with one flamboyant player sporting a monocle , top hat and moustache			1
‘ @entity82 is the pinnacle of robotics competitions and a great opportunity for us to demonstrate @entity48 ’s expertise in the field to a global audience , ’ said dr @entity95 from the university ’s @entity96			0
‘ we have some fantastic new additions to the robots for 2014 and are heading to @entity2 with the realistic ambition of at least finishing in the top 10			2
’ ‘ it is also fantastic that we get to experience some of the @entity1 fever currently gripping @entity2 and are hoping to cause a real stir among our fellow competitors and fans at the event			0
’ the @entity82 began in 1997 with the goal of ‘ developing by 2050 a robot soccer team capable of winning against the human team champion of the @entity1 ’			0

a team of five humanoid robots will compete as a team at @entity16
they were built by *engineers* at @entity59
each robot communicates during matches using built - in @entity76
the high - tech tournament kicks off in @entity17 , @entity2 on 21 july
