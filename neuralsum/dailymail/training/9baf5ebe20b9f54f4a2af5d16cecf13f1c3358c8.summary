a nuclear power plant will be built in @entity1 for the first time in a generation after the @entity4 finally signed off the project today – but will cost £ 8 billion more than expected			1
the new plant at @entity7 in @entity8 will be funded by a levy on household electricity bills , amounting to around £ 8 a year , for 35 years			1
@entity11 had launched a probe into the project amid fears the £ 17.6billion government subsidy for @entity17 firm @entity16 to build the plant broke @entity4 rules banning unfair ‘ state aid ’ for companies			1
but the @entity4 today revealed it had struck a deal with the government to cut the subsidy by £ 1billion , giving the project the go ahead			1
however , @entity26 commissioners revealed the costs of building the nuclear power station had rocketed by 50 per cent – before construction had even started			0
@entity1 will get its first nuclear power station in a generation after the @entity4 signed off on a deal with @entity17 firm @entity16 to build a reactor at @entity7 in @entity8 the government claimed the new power station would cost £ 16 billion to build			1
but the @entity36 , which has been examining the project since december , said the real cost would be £ 24.5billion			1
the two reactors planned for @entity40 , which will provide power for about 60 years , are a key part of the coalition 's drive to shift the @entity1 away from fossil fuels towards low - carbon power			2
the nuclear power station is expected to begin operating in 2023			0
the approval comes a year after headline terms of the subsidy contract were agreed by the @entity1 government , guaranteeing @entity16 and its partners a price of £ 92.50 – twice the current market price of electricity - for each megawatt - hour of power that the reactors generate over a 35 - year period			1
@entity36 vice-president @entity60 , in charge of competition policy , said : ‘ after the @entity36 's intervention , the @entity1 measures in favour of @entity7 nuclear power station have been significantly modified , limiting any distortions of competition in the @entity67			2
‘ these modifications will also achieve significant savings for @entity1 taxpayers			0
on this basis and after a thorough investigation , the @entity36 can now conclude that the support is compatible with @entity4 state aid rules			2
’ but @entity75 slammed the agreement as a ‘ world record sell out ’			0
@entity78 , at @entity7 in @entity8 last year , claims the new nuclear power station will create thousands of new jobs and cut energy bills the environmental group 's legal adviser @entity82 said : ‘ there is absolutely no legal , moral or environmental justification in turning taxes into guaranteed profits for a nuclear power company whose only legacy will be a pile of radioactive waste			1
this is a bad plan for everyone except @entity16			1
’ @entity78 has hailed the deal as ' a very big day for our country ' and boasted that @entity97 would be the first of many new nuclear power stations in @entity1			0
the prime minister added : ' the first time we ’ve built a new nuclear power station for a very long time in our country			0
other governments have promised it , they ’ve failed to deliver it			0
' this government has a long - term economic plan for @entity1 , and we ’re delivering , including this vital nuclear power station which we hope will be the first of several other nuclear power stations , kickstarting again this industry , providing thousands of jobs and providing long - term safe and secure supplies of electricity far into the future			1
' ‘ what this is an example of is government getting behind industries of the future that are a vital part of our long - term economic plan , that will provide secure and safe long - term supplies of electricity and energy for our country , and at the same time provide thousands of jobs			2
' this is about long - term planning for our economy , for our energy security and for jobs			0
that ’s what this is about			0
' @entity16 will get a guaranteed price for the electricity it generates for decades , which will be added to household bills when the plant is up and running in ten years ’ time			1
ministers argue that the plant will save consumers money compared with building offshore wind farms or importing gas from abroad			2
the new power station , known as @entity97 , will have two reactors			0
it is the first nuclear plant to be built in the @entity1 since @entity145 in @entity146 was completed in 1995			0
the government said building a new fleet of nuclear power stations could reduce bills by more than £ 75 a year in 2030			1
at full capacity the two reactors could provide up to seven per cent of the country 's energy needs			0
almost two - thirds of the nation 's existing electricity generation is due to be turned off in the next 15 years , adding to the urgent need for new power plans , minister say .			2

new plant at @entity7 in @entity8 funded by levies on electricity bills
household bills will go up by £ 8 a year for decades under government plan
@entity4 launched probe into the project over £ 17.6bn government subsidy
@entity17 firm @entity16 to build the plant and will get guaranteed cash for 35 years
ministers said new reactor would cost £ 16bn but @entity4 said price now £ 24bn
