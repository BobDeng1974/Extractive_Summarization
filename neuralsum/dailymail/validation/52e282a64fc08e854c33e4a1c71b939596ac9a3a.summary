a further four girls who attend the same east @entity2 school as three teenagers who travelled to @entity4 to join @entity5 are being monitored by detectives over fears they may seek to do the same			1
including the trio who succeeded in leaving @entity10 last month , it is thought a total of seven girls at @entity13 were considered vulnerable to being radicalised as early as december when a fellow female pupil went to join the jihadis			1
after the 15 - year - old managed to board a flight to @entity19 the other girls were placed on a government warning list with the aim of preventing them from taking the same path			0

their families fear police action may have pushed them towards leaving for @entity4 @entity13 , where four girls thought vulnerable to radicalisation are still being monitored @entity24 and @entity26 , both 15 , and 16 - year - old @entity23 are all thought to now be @entity4 after last month flying to @entity19 and travelling on by bus			1
the family of ms @entity23 has voiced concerns that letters from counter-terrorism detectives given to the girls but meant for their parents may have prompted them to leave			2
the letters , in which detectives sought permission to take statements from the trio in relation to the disappearance of their classmate in december , never reached the girls ' parents as they were not passed on			1
the letters are thought to have been sent shortly before the teenagers themselves left for @entity4 on february 17			2
@entity50 , a cousin of ms @entity23 , told @entity51 : ' were they feeling victimised by police ? were they feeling criminalised ? ' did they feel they had done something wrong ? my query would be , by giving this letter , how did that make the girls feel ? ' dated february 2 , the letters made clear the teenagers were ' not under any suspicion of doing something wrong '			1

@entity84 , the 16 - year - old sister of ms @entity23 , said she felt like police ' just let them walk out '			0
there was no evidence the girls were thinking of fleeing to @entity4 prior to their departure , @entity87 said in a statement , adding that their disappearance had ' come as a great surprise , not least to their own families '			0
the remaining four girls who are under scrutiny also received the letters and are continuing to attend @entity13 , which has been told by police there is no evidence radicalisation took place within its walls			2
it is understood that detectives have examined mobile phones belonging to the quartet to look at their contacts with the three other teenagers prior to february 17			0
one line of inquiry is believed to be the theory that the girls who travelled to @entity4 were directly assisted by an @entity5 facilitator based in @entity10 .			0

seven girls at @entity13 considered open to radicalisation
this included trio who fled to @entity4 last month after flying to @entity19
@entity121 sent letters asking parents if police could take statements
these never reached those of the three teenagers now with @entity5
family question whether letters left girls feeling ' victimised ' by detectives
