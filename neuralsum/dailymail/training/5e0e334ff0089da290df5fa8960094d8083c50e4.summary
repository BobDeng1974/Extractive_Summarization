a family was handed a £ 400 parking charge for taking too long to eat their @entity3 lunch at a pub. @entity6 and 23 of her relatives descended on the @entity8 in @entity9 for their annual festive meal in december			1
the family left the pub after spending around three hours there , having waited more than 45 minutes for their pre-booked food			1
@entity6 ( left ) was told to face charges of up to £ 100 for overstaying her limit in the car park of a pub later mrs @entity6 , 34 , and three others in the party were sent a letter ordering them to pay £ 60 for overstaying their welcome in the pub 's car park where vehicles are limited to three hours			1
if not paid within two weeks , the family was told charges would increase to £ 100 per car			1
' i was livid when the bill came through , ' said mrs @entity6 , a teacher			1
' i am outraged that they can charge you to park , especially considering the amount the party spent			1
' i will not be paying this parking fine as i believe it to be a disgrace			2
instead i will advise my family of a more friendly establishment for next year			2
' the family later learned the pub insists that customers using their parking facilities give a note of their registration number to bar staff on arrival			1
but mrs @entity6 said she was never made aware of such rules , and that the family were only there for three hours as their food had taken so long to prepare			1
' my youngest son was very tired , so we asked for chips quickly so he could eat before he fell asleep			0
' however , they took an extremely long time and he fell asleep			0
the food for everyone was served at around 1pm			0
then after my son woke up , he had chips before we left			0
' it was lovely to see the family , but this meal has now been ruined by parking fines			2
' ' if the food had been on time , none of us would have exceeded the three - hour time limit			0
' @entity8 has decided not to pursue the charges , and said it would welcome the family back			2
the pub in @entity9 said it asked customers to enter their registration numbers upon arrival to enforce the rules mrs @entity6 said she did not know she had to enter her car details to avoid facing the charges			1
above , instructions from on a sign in the car park the pub in @entity9 said it would not be pursuing the charges issued to the family , and would welcome them back in the future ' we were sorry to hear about the car parking fines faced by ms @entity6 and her party while visiting the @entity90 in early december , ' a spokesman told @entity91			1
' whilst there is signage in the shared car park – which is managed by a third party - as well as our restaurant , which clearly states the maximum length of stay and also highlights the option to sign - up for a further two hours of free parking for our guests , we appreciate this is a substantial fine that has marred an otherwise enjoyable dining experience			1
' with this in mind , in this particular instance we would like to cover the cost of the fines as a gesture of goodwill to the party and look forward to welcoming them back to the restaurant in 2015			0
experts have warned against unsolicited parking fines and charges brought by private companies			2
according to @entity119 , such letters are not enforceable fines but mere invoices			0
' if you get an unfair private ticket , do n't just pay it ! ' advice on the company 's website reads			0
' trying to reclaim cash already paid is n't easy , so it 's far easier to dispute it			0
beating an unfair ticket is n't an exact science			0
' these companies have no official right to fine you , though they may try to make you think they do			0
' all they 're doing is sending you a notice for what they deem to be a breach of contract			0
