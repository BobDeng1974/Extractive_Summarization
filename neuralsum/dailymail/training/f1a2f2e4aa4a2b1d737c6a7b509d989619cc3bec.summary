this lion has shown the world exactly who 's king of the pride after he delighted visitors to his safari park with several almighty roars which echoed across the grounds - before he got bored and retired for a nap			1
in scenes strikingly similar to animated children 's film ' @entity14 ' , the @entity10 lion prowled out onto a rocky plateau and made a series of impressive deep growling noises before launching into a roar			1
visitors to the @entity20 were clearly delighted and in footage filmed during the spectacle much oohing and aahing can be heard as they watch the alpha male make the spine - tingling sounds			1
the lion at @entity20 ( pictured ) showed off his vocal range during his recent performance at one point it sounded almost as if the big cat was barking at the crowd with a rhythmic and guttural growl which reverberated around the enclosure			1
clearly satisfied with a job well done , the lion then appears to tire of his efforts and turns his back on the crowd , presumably to go back to sleep			1
it is unclear if the lion was warning someone off or simply stretching his vocal chords			1
the video , which was uploaded yesterday on @entity51 , has already garnered more than 88,500 views			2
the incident resembles a scene from hit movie @entity14 in which @entity56 , a sheltered and spoiled zoo lion , roars for his doting fans as part of a nightly show			1
the male @entity10 lion appeared to lose interest with the crowd following his spine - tingling display the incident resembles a scene from hit movie @entity14 in which @entity56 roars for his doting fans it is not clear which of @entity20 's three male @entity10 lions gave the impressive performance			1
the video sparked a number of comments on social media			2

you could feel the sound vibrating in your chest			2
' the incident was similar to @entity106 's nightly show of roaring in children 's film ' @entity14 ' ( pictured ) @entity109 , who witnessed the event , said : ' i 'm pretty sure the reason the little kids around quieted down was because of the reverberations			1
i had no idea an animal could make that kind of sound			2
' @entity118 added : ' when you hear a lion roar in real life , you can feel it go through your body			1
i was at the zoo and my buddy thought it was some loudspeaker before we saw the lion actually roaring			0
he thought there was no way that an animal could make that sound			0
i do n't blame him though , it really is monstrous in person			0
' the @entity20 has continuously had lions on show since it opened in 1972			1
in 2004 the @entity20 â€™s @entity137 opened with the arrival of six six - month - old lion cubs from a facility in @entity10			1
@entity137 is currently home to three of those original six cubs : male @entity143 and his two female companions , @entity145 and @entity146			0
many of their 18 surviving cubs from over the years are now residing in other zoos , but six are still at the park , including a litter of four born in july 2014			0
lions vary in colour but typically sport light yellow - brown coats			0
mature male lions are unique among big cats due the thick brown or black manes that encircle their necks and protect them while fighting			1
in the wild lions consume a wide variety of prey , from wildebeest , impala , zebra , giraffe , buffalo and wild hogs to sometimes even rhinos and hippos			0
they will also feed on smaller animals such as hares , birds and reptiles			0
lions are also known to attack elephants when food is scarce			0
the lion population in @entity10 has been reduced by half since the early 1950s			1
today , less than 21,000 remain in all of @entity10			1
the only social member of the cat family , lions live in large groups called prides , consisting of about 15 lions			0
related females and their young make up the majority of the pride			0
a single male , or sometimes a small group of two or three males , will join a pride for an indefinite period , usually about three years or until another group of males takes over			0
males defend the pride 's territory , which may include some 100 square miles of grasslands , scrub , or open woodlands			0
female lions are the pride 's primary hunters and often work together to catch their prey			0
