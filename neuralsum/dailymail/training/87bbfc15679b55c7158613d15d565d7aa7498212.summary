@entity0 said he blamed a 1988 advert on the high number of youngsters attending university			1
he added that @entity5 should look at legalising drugs including heroin millions will remember @entity10 ’s tv character @entity11 praising her grandson when he ‘ got an ’ ology ’			1
but the tv advert from 1988 has been blamed by @entity15 leader @entity0 for encouraging a generation to study for what he considers to be worthless degrees			1
the @entity20 commercial shows miss @entity10 being told her grandson has failed almost every subject in his gcses – but passed sociology			1
clearly relieved , she tells him : ‘ you got an ’ ology , you ’re a scientist			2
’ the @entity15 leader said : ‘ we have got a lot of people getting ’ ologies , and i think the way we have demeaned the idea of people learning skills and trades , is just stupid			1
i blame @entity10 for the whole thing			2
‘ i think we are sending too many youngsters to university			2
we are encouraging people to go and get degrees , in many cases not particularly good degrees			0
’ the comments were made just after mr @entity0 said that he believes the war on drugs has been lost and @entity5 should look at legalising them - including heroin			1
the @entity5 @entity15 leader made the highly controversial claim that @entity50 , where drugs were decriminalised 12 years ago , may have a ‘ more enlightened ’ approach			1
he said in a television phone - in that he ‘ hates drugs ’ , has never taken them , and has experience of the damage they can do to young people ’s lives			0
but he believes the current laws criminalising users are ineffective , and would back a @entity63 to look at alternatives including that in @entity50 and some @entity67 states			1
‘ i personally think that the war on drugs was lost many , many years ago and that the lives of millions of people in @entity5 are being made miserable by the huge criminal element that surrounds the illicit drugs trade and i do think that @entity50 does show us that perhaps there is a better , more enlightened way to deal with this ’ , he said			1
‘ i ’m not pro-drugs by the way , as someone with teenage children , and i ’ve seen fairly close to hand the damage that drugs can do to young people			0
of the television advert , pictured , @entity0 said : ' we have got a lot of people getting ' ologies , and i think the way we have demeaned the idea of people learning skills and trades , is just stupid			2
i blame @entity10 for the whole thing ' ‘ so i hate drugs , i ’ve never taken them myself , i hope i never do , but i just have a feeling that the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping @entity5 society , ' he told a @entity99 phone - in			1
‘ i think we should look at it and if ever there was a subject where we needed a genuine @entity63 – not to kick it in the long grass – but a genuine @entity63 to examine @entity50 , to examine perhaps what has happened in one or two states in @entity67 and in @entity107 , this subject would be it			1
’ mr @entity0 admitted these were his personal views , and not @entity15 policy , saying : ‘ this is one subject where i differ strongly from my party ’			1
in @entity50 , drug users are allowed a 10 day supply , which the law states can include a gram of heroin he was asked by a viewer about @entity50 , where police and courts no longer pursue people for buying or possessing small amounts of drugs			2
they are allowed a 10 day supply , which the law states is a gram of heroin , two grams of cocaine , 5g of cannabis and up to a gram of ecstasy or amphetamine			2
anyone with these drugs in higher quantities is treated as a dealer and charged in court			0
those caught with drugs within these limits must report to a ‘ warning commission on addition ’ which can send them to rehab if they are deemed to have a problem			0
experts are divided on how well this has worked , with no big increase in drug use as some had predicted , but no substantial drop either , and in some years deaths from drugs been high			0
prime minister @entity155 , pictured today in @entity156 , has rejected calls from mps to consider decriminalisation dr @entity160 , president of the @entity161 , declared last year that decriminalisation , which treats drug taking as an illness rather than a crime , had ‘ not worked ’			0
mr @entity0 expressed his support , earlier this year , for @entity166 who said following a visit to @entity168 that @entity5 needed to look at alternatives to prohibition			1
the @entity15 leader said in february : ‘ the fact is our current approach to drugs is neither practical nor effective			1
i strongly believe in promoting individual freedom – but i also strongly believe in reducing the public harm caused by drugs			0
‘ as a parent as much as a politician , i say we have to accept that current policy has not achieved the reductions in crime or consumption that we 'd hoped for			0
’ @entity155 and @entity185 shot down calls from the @entity187 for a royal commission on drugs in 2012			0
mr @entity155 said at the time : ‘ i do n't support decriminalisation			0
we have a policy which actually is working in @entity5			2
drugs use is coming down , the emphasis on treatment is absolutely right , and we need to continue with that to make sure we can really make a difference			0
also , we need to do more to keep drugs out of our prisons			0
‘ these are the government 's priorities and i think we should continue with that rather than have some very , very long - term royal commission			0

@entity20 advert features @entity10 praising grandson on his ' ology '
