a mother whose @entity2 husband snatched their two sons and kept them captive for 18 months has described the moment they were finally reunited after the children were freed in a dramatic raid by @entity9 police			1
@entity11 ’s sons are now back in @entity12 living with their mother following a lengthy legal battle in which she won a landmark ruling in @entity16 that ordered her estranged husband @entity17 to return @entity18 , eight , and his six - year - old brother , @entity19			1
when he refused and went on the run with the youngsters , police tracked him to a secluded , one - bedroom apartment in @entity9 where they were hiding with his mother			1
back together again : happy @entity11 hugs sons @entity18 , eight ( left ) and @entity19 , six ( right ) during the harrowing rescue the boys , who had been brainwashed into believing that their mother was an ogre who wanted to hurt them , were forced by their grandmother to scream in @entity2 : ‘ no , no. we do n’t want to go			1
’ speaking for the first time , @entity11 , who witnessed the raid , said that when she first saw her sons after being separated from them for a year and a half , she broke down in tears			1
‘ i just wanted to grab them and hug them , ’ she said			0
‘ but i did n’t want to frighten them , knowing how much they had been through and what they had been told about me			0
’ the boys , who were wearing only their underwear and had n’t spoken to their mother for more than a year , had been told by their father that @entity11 was a ‘ baddy ’ gangster who had bandits searching for them			1
by the time @entity2 authorities finally found the bolthole in which they were imprisoned , the boys had n’t been to school for seven months and had only been allowed outside one at a time so as not to arouse suspicion			1
‘ when the bailiff rang the door the grandmother refused to open it , ’ @entity11 said			1
‘ she simply would not co-operate			0
it was n’t until they started taking off the locks that she finally opened the door			0
went on the run : former lecturer @entity64 refused to comply with court orders and fled with his sons ‘ my son told me later that just before his grandmother opened the door she told them that the bandits had arrived and they had to “ do what they had practised ”			1
‘ when we entered the apartment she started shouting hysterically			2
she got them to start chanting with her in @entity2 , saying i was bad and they did n’t want to go			2
i could n’t believe my ears			0
when i saw them at first they looked so delicate , yet so much bigger than in my memory			0
my babies had grown so much			0
‘ it was so calculated and cold - hearted			2
i was devastated for my children and shocked she could behave like this with children she supposedly loved			2
but it said it all about child abduction			2
it is cruel , selfish and manipulative			0
it has everything to do with power and nothing to do with love			0
‘ finally the officials were able to get them all dressed and leave the apartment with them to go to the police station			0
even though i was present at the collection , it was only at the police station that we were properly reintroduced			0
’ today the boys are back living in @entity12 and have been reunited with their baby brother @entity103 , who is two			1
clutching her boys tightly , @entity11 said : ‘ we took it slowly at first , but within a few hours they were returning my hugs and kisses			1
‘ @entity19 told me happily : “ @entity110 , you ’re not bad ! i love you ! ” hearing them call me mummy again brought tears to my eyes			2
being separated from my sons was incredibly painful and i lived with anxiety every day			0
‘ i spent 20 hours a day on the internet and the phone			0
when children are stolen you fear you ’ll never see them again			0
you pray for a miracle			0
’ @entity11 ’s ordeal began after she and @entity17 married in @entity122 in 2004			1
they moved to @entity124 in january 2011 and @entity17 , who has dual @entity2 and @entity127 citizenship , worked as a full - time lecturer at @entity129			1
the couple became estranged after @entity17 became controlling and bullying , and later that year they split up			1
@entity11 , a former teacher from @entity133 , realised she was pregnant with @entity103 only after she had fled the family home			1
at first the boys were allowed supervised contact with their father , which later became a regular schedule of overnight stays and holidays			0
the courts approved a trip to @entity9 with their father to visit his extended family in december 2012			1
@entity11 recalled : ‘ it was hard for me to imagine being separated from them for two weeks but i was trying to do the right thing			2
’ then , on january 7 , her worst fears were realised when she received an email from @entity17 saying they would not be returning			2
determined to fight for her children , @entity11 set up a campaign and fundraising site on @entity155 called @entity156			2
eventually two meetings were arranged , but when @entity11 flew out to @entity2 , @entity17 and the boys did n’t show			1
after a handful of @entity161 calls , @entity17 cut off all access to the children			2
showdown : @entity9 police raided the one - bedroom apartment in @entity9 , in the building pictured above , where they found the children with their grandmother in the first year after the abduction @entity11 ’s case was heard in court a dozen times in two jurisdictions			1
every single order made demanded that the children be returned to her immediately			0
but @entity17 ignored them all			2
then came the historic @entity16 ruling last september			0
@entity17 appealed but after losing his case in november he disappeared , having earlier hidden his mother and the boys in an unregistered apartment to evade complying with the orders			1
with the aid of @entity185 , @entity11 sought an international arrest warrant for @entity17 , hoping that if he were found he would be forced to reveal the location of the children			1
this was the first case in the @entity12 and in @entity2 to use the newly ratified 1996 @entity191 for the @entity192			1
when news came through that the apartment had been found she was overjoyed			0
today , the family is returning to some semblance of normal life			0
‘ what amazes me is how quickly our bond was re-established , despite their father having done everything he could to eliminate me from their lives , ’ she said			0
‘ the imprint of love from their early years was still there and still strong			0
’ @entity11 was able to claim £ 40,000 in legal aid to help her battle , and more was raised through the appeal – but she is still £ 20,000 in debt .			1
