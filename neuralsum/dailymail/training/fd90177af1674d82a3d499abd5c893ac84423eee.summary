by @entity1 reporter hoards of giant tropical @entity3 have invaded the @entity4 because of strong winds , scientists have revealed			1
the massive @entity3 - which weigh an average 157st each and measure 15ft by 12ft - have been spotted in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
large shoals of @entity3 - the largest bony fish in the world - have been tempted away from the mid-atlantic by a massive hatch of jellyfish , which is their main food			1
@entity18 expert @entity17 with the giant sunfish he stumbled across earlier this month in @entity10 sea monster : @entity3 can measure 15ft across from fin to fin and 12 feet from nose to tail @entity18 scientists believe the sunfish , whose scientific name is @entity3 , have been carried round @entity27 to the @entity4 by strong prevailing winds and currents			1
here they have been dying because they can not easily tolerate water temperatures below @entity31			0
the @entity32 has recorded significantly more sightings of sunfish on the @entity35 than last year			0
in january this year a sunfish was found on the beach in seaside resort @entity38 in @entity42 dog walker @entity40 , 44 , found another while walking his @entity44 along the @entity46 beach near @entity47			2
wildlife enthusiast @entity48 made a third discovery of a dead sunfish on the beach in @entity52 , @entity10 , on december 9			1
in early december @entity48 ( pictured above ) found a dead sunfish in @entity10			1
november a six - stone sunfish was discovered washed up along the @entity46 beach near @entity47 , @entity8			0
back in january another @entity56 mola was found on a @entity58 beach - this time at the seaside resort of @entity38 in @entity9			2
scientists believe they were following a shoal of jellyfish when they were caught by strong prevailing winds			1
the sunfish , which can grow up to a whopping 157st , died due to the cold as they find it difficult to tolerate water temperatures below @entity31			2
other recent unusual finds along our coastline include a 35ft sperm whale which was discovered 14 miles from @entity46 at @entity72 in april			0
in 2011 a 55ft fin whale washed up on the beach in @entity75 , @entity76 , which normally lives far away in the @entity77			1
in 2008 an extremely rare 12ft @entity80 's beaked whale and a baby @entity78 were found within days of each other on the western shores of @entity84 on the @entity85			2
@entity86 , director of the @entity32 , has recorded more sightings of sunfish on the @entity35 than last year			0
he said : ' it is rare and unusual to get sunfish in the @entity4			1
they are mainly found in the middle of the @entity77 and the furthest i had ever previously seen them go is the @entity96 coast			1
' when there are stronger prevailing winds and currents the jellyfish and sunfish are carried to the @entity102 of @entity58			1
' then if the prevailing winds are strong enough some navigate around @entity27 to the @entity4			1
the levels in the @entity4 are higher this year			1
' for sunfish to be washed up is even rarer as the prevailing winds would usually propel it away from land			0
' i have heard of sightings in @entity113 and @entity114 waters but on an @entity116 beach on the east coast is rare			2
' disc - like sunfish weigh an average 2,200lbs and measure 15ft across from fin to fin and 12 feet from nose to tail			0
the sunfish swims on its side on the surface to gain heat from the sun , which is how it got its @entity116 name			0
its scientific name , @entity3 , is based on the @entity131 for ' millstone ' which it was thought to resemble due to its colour , rough skin and round shape			2
its top and bottom teeth are fused to form a beak and it has claw - like teeth in its throat to help mash its diet of jellyfish			0
the sunfish 's skin , which is covered in dense mucus , is so leathery that it is host to more dermal parasites than any other sea creature			0
it has even been reported to leap 10 feet out of the water , supposedly in an attempt to rid itself of infestations			0
the giant sunfish which washed up on the @entity10 coast			2
it may have been caught in a strong current that carried it around @entity27 young fish are silvery in colour and adults are usually grey above , silvery grey to brown on the side , and paler or dusky on the belly , with differing mottling and spots			1
they have a unique ability to suck and spit water at the same time , which helps drag in their @entity173 develop their truncated , bullet - like shape because the back fin which they are born with never grows			0
instead , it folds into itself as the enormous creature matures , creating a rounded rudder called a clavus			0
they tend to swim alone and their mating practices are poorly understood			0
they live 10 years in captivity but their lifespan in the wild has n't been confirmed			0
@entity3 have been recorded in @entity58 waters before but their appearance is becoming more and more regular - a fact attributed to the rising temperatures of @entity58 seas			1
the fish are also known to swim of course when following shoals of small sealife , which they feed off .			0

@entity3 usually found in tropical and temperate waters
experts believe @entity3 were pursuing jellyfish in @entity77 when they were caught in strong currents and *whisked* around @entity27 to @entity4
@entity3 died as not used to @entity209 sea temperature off @entity10
