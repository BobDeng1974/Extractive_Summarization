around 650,000 people in @entity24 alone are going without the treatment - which costs just 23 pence per day to provide - with only enough funding to provide a third of sufferers with free treatment			2
the aid agency fears that the funding shortfall risks undermining the significant progress which has been made to halt the number of new infections worldwide , because people with @entity14 not taking arvs are more likely to transmit the disease to others			1
@entity2 said : ' so many people are n’t getting the medicines they need through no fault of their own , simply because they drew the short straw geographically			0
i met people who had been literally rescued from death by medicines which cost only 23 pence a day			0

' i choose to listen to @entity83 , a lady i met in @entity24 who is living with the @entity14 virus , who told me quietly and simply that she would be dead if it were not for medicines paid for by our aid			2
' ahead of the chancellor ’s @entity92 statement on wednesday , @entity9 has welcomed the @entity6 government ’s commitment to meet its aid promises and is urging it to encourage other international donors to do so			0
@entity9 chief executive , @entity98 , said : ' it is heartbreaking that seven million lives are still on the line today , when world leaders promised that they would ensure everyone in the world would have access to hiv prevention , care and treatment by 2010			1
' @entity6 aid is helping to improve healthcare in countries like @entity24 , but there is still a very long way to go and millions of lives globally are still at risk			0
' now more than ever it ’s crucial that international donors follow the @entity6 ’s lead and increase their commitments to aid , which for many really does mean the difference between life and death			0
