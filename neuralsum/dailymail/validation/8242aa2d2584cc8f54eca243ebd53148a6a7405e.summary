for one , this was a case of treading fresh ground			2
for others , it was about settling back into roles that were once familiar			2
something old , something new			2
and something surprisingly blue , in the hue of @entity10 ’s jerseys			1
thankfully for @entity12 , there was no off - colour outcome			1
a win is a win			2
even when it comes after the typical drudgery that international friendlies can bring			2
let ’s just say that no - one who sat through this 90 minutes will be feverishly petitioning for the return of the @entity21			1
@entity22 made his first appearance for @entity12 against @entity10 on wednesday night not that there were n’t points of interest prior to @entity28 ’s late winner			1
at least three featured in @entity30 ’s starting selection			2
a debut for @entity22 was the headline act			1
a supporting cast of talking points came via @entity36 ’s return in goal and @entity38 being given the nod as captain			2
in a squad that has a settled core of certainties , @entity30 ’ s aims are all about fine tuning ahead of the remaining @entity46 qualifiers			2
@entity22 ’s admission that he had never actually set foot north of the border caught the attention when he was called up last week			1
yet there was also no mistaking the pride felt by the @entity54 - born @entity53 winger , who qualifies for @entity12 through his father @entity55 - originally from @entity56			1
an instant first cap deepened the family delight			2
the 25 - year - old has been an integral part of his club ’s highly promising bid for promotion to the land of milk and honey that is the @entity67			1
we will have to wait a bit longer for an accurate assessment of his worth as an international , but this was far from the worst start			2
he already has an assist to his name after plonking the match - winning corner onto @entity28 ’s head			1
@entity22 operates on the right but is almost all left foot			1
that quality was seen early on when he dropped anchor to deceive @entity85 and fired a curling delivery deep beyond the back post			2
it was tailor - made for @entity89 , hardly noted for his aerial prowess , but his header back across came to nothing			1
@entity53 winger @entity22 qualified for @entity12 through his father @entity55 the former @entity94 man has 11 goals for @entity53 this season and offered a glimpse of that direct threat just after the hour mark			1
working an exchange with @entity101 , he hammered a blistering drive wide from 25 yards out			0
another , less powerful , effort was comfortably grasped by @entity104			0
while the @entity107 goalkeeper was just about the busiest man in @entity109 ’ s line - up , the polar opposite was true for @entity36			1
he had played the second half of the 3 - 1 friendly defeat from @entity113 at @entity114 to earn a 41st cap , but this was his first start for the national side in more than four years			1
for long enough , it had seemed that 3 - 0 win over @entity121 at @entity122 in november 2010 might just have marked the end of his @entity12 career			1
here , though , was further confirmation of a remarkable revival			0
at club level , @entity36 could well end up achieving an historic domestic treble with @entity130 this year			0
having come through a gruelling rehabilitation to fully recover from a complex knee injury , his free transfer signing stands as one of the bargains of this or any other season			0
yet he openly admits the dream of returning to a @entity12 shirt provided another level of motivation on the long road back to fitness			1
now that has been achieved , he has his sights set on a place in the @entity147			0
eight more caps are needed			0
@entity28 gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for @entity12 to grab them , he will have to hold off the sizeable challenge presented by @entity155 and @entity156 by continuing to impress			1
not that there was much chance to do so last night			0
in his 45 - minute outing , @entity36 was so under - deployed he could have scribbled out autographs to the supporters sitting behind his goal			1
the most excitement he got was a brief sprint out of his area to intercept a long through - ball and feed a pass to @entity168			1
hardly enough to have his heart racing			0
the biggest danger to @entity36 was contracting a chill through inactivity , but that even that threat was removed when he was allowed to watch the second half from the bench , wrapped in a warm jacket			0
@entity156 took his place , so what odds @entity155 now being given the nod against @entity180 on sunday ? given the opposition , the real decision about who is the new @entity184 can almost be deferred until the crucial trip to @entity186 in june			0
the same might well be said of the captaincy			0
this was only @entity38 ’s second start under @entity30 and , with @entity191 on the bench , he was always going to take the armband			0
like @entity36 , there were once doubts whether this scenario would return			0
his fight against the ravages of ulcerative colitis has been well documented but , following surgery last year , this is the first season in many in which he can be considered fully fit for action			0
it is also the first of his professional life away from @entity207			0
@entity38 ’s january move to @entity209 has provided him with the opportunity of regular first team action that was always going to be problematic as @entity212 reshaped his squad at @entity214			0
his influence has been rapidly felt at the @entity216 , particularly as @entity217 immediately installed him as captain			0
back on show at @entity219 , he produced typical @entity38 fare			0
nothing flashy , but a calm assurance in keeping the team ticking over			0
win the ball , pass it wisely , cover space , repeat			0
like @entity12 as whole , he simply got the job done .			1

@entity22 made @entity12 debut in 1 - 0 *victory* over @entity10
the @entity53 winger qualified for @entity12 through his father @entity55
@entity22 supplied the cross for @entity28 *'s* late winner
