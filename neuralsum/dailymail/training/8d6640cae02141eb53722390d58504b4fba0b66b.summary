a cruel @entity1 female doctor who told mothers their new - born babies had died , but had secretly sold them , has been given a suspended death sentence			1
obstetrician @entity5 , 55 , was found guilty of stealing seven babies after telling their parents the newborns were sick or had died - before selling the children to traffickers for £ 2,255 for females and £ 5,240 for males			1
the court in @entity15 city , in @entity16 , was told that six of the babies were recovered safely by police and returned to their parents - but one was found dead in a ditch , where it had been dumped by a trafficker for unknown reasons			1
@entity5 , an obstetrician involved in baby trafficking , standing trial in @entity26 in @entity15 , @entity27 province in december			1
she was handed a suspended death sentence for stealing seven babies and selling them to traffickers evidence against @entity5 showed that on one occasion she had persuaded a mother to give up her newborn female twins on the grounds that one had died of a disease and the other had injured arms and legs			1
@entity5 was sentenced to death with a two - year reprieve , meaning that if she offends again in a similar way in that time she will be shot			2
but it is unlikely she will have any chance of repeating the crime because it is suggested by observers that her sentence will probably be commuted to life in prison			0
it is believed @entity5 sold many more children than the seven she was charged with stealing			1
according to reports received by police , some 26 babies were stolen from their mothers and @entity5 was named as the main suspect			1
the obstetrician was arrested after a young couple claimed their baby had been abducted in july last year			0
hundreds of babies have been rescued after police in @entity1 launched a crackdown on four baby trafficking websites			2
nearly 2,000 suspects were arrested as a result of the nationwide operation police said that @entity5 told them their son had caught hepatitis b and syphillis from them , yet doctors had told them they were free of both diseases			2
the couple were among the fortunate parents whose baby was returned to them			0
@entity5 's suspended death sentence has outraged many @entity1 internet users , one writer on @entity79 - @entity1 's equivalent of @entity80 - insisting : ' she should die			2
she is the shame of the medical profession			0
' another demanded that ' the death penalty should be carried out immediately			0
' under @entity1 's strict population control policies , most couples can have only one child			0
those who have more than one have secretly made money by selling the second - born to traffickers - particularly if that baby is a boy			0
but times might be changing - legislatures recently endorsed a resolution easing the one - child policy allowing couple to have two babies if either parent is an only child .			0
