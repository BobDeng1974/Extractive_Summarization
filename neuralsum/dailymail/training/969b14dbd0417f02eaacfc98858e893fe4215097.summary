by @entity0 published : 02:03 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 02:03 est , 3 march 2014 a 12 year old @entity3 boy who is losing his sight wants to fill a ' visual bucket list ' before he goes blind			1
@entity6 , who together with two of his older brothers suffers from retinitis pigmentosa , a hereditary condition that robs sufferers of their sight , sometimes within months , is in a race against time to experience some of the world ’s wonders before it ’s too late			1
his parents , @entity20 and @entity21 , asked him what he would like to see most – and the brave boy came up with a heart - warming hit list			2
boy on a mission : @entity6 wants to complete his bucket list before he goes blind @entity28 , from @entity29 , chose the @entity30 , @entity31 , the @entity32 and , in a sign of the times , @entity36 headquarters in @entity37			1
and unlike most @entity38 , who have a passion for either rugby or cricket , he also said he wanted to watch a live @entity43 basketball game in the @entity44			1
' last year was a hard one for poor louis , ' mrs @entity45 told @entity47			2
' that 's when he learned that his case was accelerated			2
' ( but ) this year we 're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can			2
' for some reason he really got hooked on @entity44 basketball			0
he cares about nothing else			0
he is really quite passionate about it			0
' in control : @entity28 's list has involved him travelling to the @entity44 game on : @entity6 ( left ) with brother @entity61 will watch the @entity43 live this week with @entity28 ' eyesight fading rapidly - by 50 % in the past year alone - the trip was going to have to happen soon			1
a @entity43 - based businessman heard of the family ’s plight and moved to make the little boy ’s dream come true			1
@entity69 , ceo of a @entity44 - based software firm , made a large donation and vowed to raise even more so @entity28 and his family could be in @entity43 for the @entity43 ’s game against the @entity74 on march 5			1
' i did it because the @entity77 are my next door neighbours , ' said mr @entity69 , who splits his time between @entity43 and his home in @entity29			2
he persuaded @entity81 to pay for the airfare and donated his own points			0
thanks to the generosity of mr @entity69 and his partners at @entity87 , who agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised , and the generosity of people around the world , more than $ 25,000 was raised in just four weeks			0
' it is so touching , ' mrs @entity45 said			0
' people are just so supportive			0
' enjoying life : @entity28 ( second from top ) has visited @entity97 as part of his bucket list sports fan : @entity28 ( second left ) has met some of his sporting idols , including @entity3 cricketers @entity106 ( left ) and @entity107 the fund - raising campaign also came to the attention of @entity110 , wife of @entity43 ceo @entity112 ' @entity111 , whose 21 - year - old son suffers from a similar condition to @entity28 ’			1
' somebody tweeted me an article about this boy in @entity3 and told me i should read it , ' said mrs @entity110 , incoming chairwoman of the @entity120			0
' i completely understood where the @entity77 were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for ( @entity28 )			0
it 's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through			0
' of course when i read about how he was a big @entity43 fan , i knew that we had to have him come for a game			1
” while mrs @entity110 said she would ensure @entity28 and his family get some of the best seats in the house , she said the real show would be before tipoff , when the @entity136 chorus sings the @entity44 national anthem			0
' i think for a 12 - year - old like @entity28 , for him to be able to watch visually impaired kids perform the national anthem on a national stage , for him to see what blind people can achieve , that 's going to give him the lasting memory , ' she said			1
whiz kid : louis has visited @entity150 in @entity37 time of his laugh : @entity28 has n't lost his sense of humour despite his condition			2

@entity6 , 12 , has rare condition that will rob him of his sight
@entity160 has drawn up a list of things to see before he goes blind
the @entity165 fan wants to watch his *beloved* @entity43 live
businessmen and wife of @entity43 boss will make his dream come true
