a rare , endangered sea turtle was spotted off the @entity2 coast after it got lost on its way to the @entity4			1
the 4ft loggerhead turtle was seen as it made its 3,000 mile journey across the @entity7 from the east coast of @entity9			1
it is thought the unusually warm @entity12 waters fooled the creature into thinking it had arrived in the @entity15			1
the turtle was spotted by a sailor off the @entity2 coast			1
it is believed the turtle mistook the warm waters of @entity12 for the @entity15 where it usually migrates to at this time of the year the turtle was spotted by sailor , @entity21 , off @entity22 in @entity2			1
mr @entity21 was fishing on his 23ft motorboat when he caught a glimpse of the animal which is listed as endangered by the @entity26			1
' i was out on my boat on my own doing a spot of fishing when i saw a large creature just under the surface about 200ft away , ' he said			1
' at first i thought it might be a giant ocean sunfish but then it surfaced about 30ft away and i could see it was a huge turtle			1
' mr @entity21 , who is a @entity37 squadron leader added : ' it looked up at the boat and we locked eyes			0
as soon as it saw me it dived back under the water and i did n't see it again			0
' i was quite surprised to see it - turtle sightings are rare enough in @entity12 waters but afterwards i found out it was a very rare loggerhead turtle			1
' i have done a lot of diving abroad and seen turtles before but i have never seen one in the @entity12			1
@entity54 swam over 30 miles up the @entity55 in @entity56 , entertaining many holidaymakers on its way ' it was a wonderful creature and i feel very privileged to have seen it close up			2
' visits to @entity12 shores from loggerheads are incredibly rare , with the last reported sighting of a lin @entity2 in 1938			1
in 2012 there were 45 sightings of the more common leatherback turtles in @entity12 waters , but only four loggerheads were spotted which were all dead			1
dr @entity70 , a biodiversity programme manager for the @entity71 , said : ' to see an adult loggerhead in @entity12 waters is quite unusual			1
' we do get them coming to our waters occasionally but they are usually stray juveniles with a very low tolerance for our cold waters ' this loggerhead will have almost certainly come from the east coast of the @entity9 and will have been drawn here by our unusually warm waters			1
' the recent warm weather not only heated up our seas but also resulted in very healthy jellyfish stocks which turtles feed on			2
' loggerheads will travel great distances from their feeding to their breeding grounds and the likelihood is once our waters start cooling down this turtle will head home			1
' loggerheads are the most temperate species of marine turtle , with breeding grounds in the @entity4 and the east coast of the @entity9			2
they only feed in waters above @entity102 and can not survive in waters colder than @entity104			2
the turtles , whose latin name is @entity108 , nest on beaches and get their name from their unusually large heads			2
they feed on crabs , mussels , clams and jellyfish , and can weigh up to 400lbs			0
earlier this week a dolphin was spotted swimming up the @entity55 in @entity56 and in @entity121			2
the dolphin , nicknamed @entity123 , was rescued after becoming stranded on a sandbank having entertained holidaymakers for four days			0
the 6ft short - beaked common dolphin stunned crowds with a display of leaps and clicking noises along the 9 mile stretch of water			0
she has since been safely returned to the sea , where she will no doubt rejoin the pod she strayed from last week			0
a swordfish usually found in the tropical waters of the @entity7 , @entity139 and @entity140 oceans has landed in the nets of a @entity143 fisherman			2
the fish was caught on wednesday morning by @entity145 on the @entity146 , a catamaran fishing boat used to catch wild salmon and sea trout off the @entity151 coast			0
it has since made its way to a local fishmonger , @entity155 , who was delighted to see the swordfish turn up in his daily delivery			0
mr @entity155 said : ' it 's spectacular , it is really nice to see such an unusual fish on our shores and it shows off what we have in the @entity143			0
' this is the second swordfish i have come across in five years			0
we have also caught a few tuna of late as well			0
' i was expecting lobsters , crab and a few squid			0
the last thing i expected to be selling is a swordfish ! ' ' i have had a lot of interest from customers who have came in to see the fish on the counter			0
' i think the customers will appreciate its freshness			0
i will be cutting it up today and having a bit for my tea ! ' @entity151 fishmonger , @entity155 , was thrilled to be handed a rare swordfish in his daily delivery on wednesday morning			0
the fish is usually found in more tropical waters in the @entity7 , @entity139 and @entity140 oceans			0

the endangered loggerhead turtle was spotted by a sailor off @entity22 , @entity2
