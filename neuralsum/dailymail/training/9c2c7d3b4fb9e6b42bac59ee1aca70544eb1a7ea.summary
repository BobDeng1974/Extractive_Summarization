by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 8 february 2013 the @entity1 is ' falling behind ' on features , according to one of @entity5 's key founders			1
@entity6 - known as @entity7 - founded the giant @entity9 firm with @entity10 in 1976			0
and although it 's 35 years since the other @entity10 parted company with @entity5 , people still sit up and listen when he speaks out about the company and its products			1
outspoken @entity6 still prefers to queue up for a new @entity5 product at a local store , and camped overnight to buy the @entity1 when it launched speaking to @entity19 , a @entity21 website , mr @entity6 said that the @entity1 is ' somewhat behind with features in the smartphone business			1
' others have caught up			0
@entity25 is a big competitor			0
but precisely because they are currently making great products			2
' this is not the first time that mr @entity6 has spoken out about @entity5			1
rivals : @entity25 's @entity32 ( left ) is perceived as more innovative than the @entity33 ( right ) last year he told technology website @entity35 : ' @entity5 was just used to cranking out the newest @entity1 and falling a little behind and that worries me greatly			1
' it worries me because i love @entity5			1
' it worries me if @entity5 were to lose ground because they were making the same things they know how to make			2
' @entity43 is not @entity5 - style innovation			2
' and in a move that shocked die - hard @entity5 fans , he praised @entity50 's @entity49 operating system : ' just for looks and beauty , i definitely favour the @entity54 phone over @entity55			1
' i 'm kind of shocked on every screen — much more beautiful than the same apps on @entity55 and @entity1			0
' @entity6 ( pictured right ) first met @entity10 ( left ) in 1970 , and the pair founded @entity5 in 1976 and shortly after that launched the @entity5 i. that was followed by the @entity5 computer , which established the company founded in a @entity9 garage as a major player on the fledgling computer scene			2
mr @entity6 was seriously injured in a plane crash in 1981 when the aircraft he was piloting crashed on take - off			0
h he spent two years making a slow recovery , and left @entity5 officially in 1987			2
since then he 's gone on to be a noted champion of technology start - ups			0
mr @entity6 is also a well - known philanthropist , with his projects including financing the technology programme in his local school district			0
he 's also been an occasional thorn in the side of the company he co-founded , making outspoken attacks on @entity5 's launch of its mapping app and @entity84			1
mr @entity6 also shocked observers last year when he praised @entity50 's @entity49 operating system , saying he favoured it over phones using @entity90 's @entity55 operating system			1
however , he did go on to say that the @entity1 is still his favourite handset			0
but in a cheeky sting in the tail , he also said that he thought ' @entity10 might have been reincarnated at @entity50 due to a lot of what i see and feel with this phone making me think of a lot of great @entity5 things '			1
mr @entity6 also spoke out about the @entity100 fiasco that erupted when the @entity33 was launched			0
@entity5 had dropped @entity100 in favour of its own mapping app , which turned out to be a disaster when it was revealed to be inaccurate and badly executed			2
disappointed users were all over the web saying how angry they were , and sharing screenshots that showed missing roads , missing buildings - @entity112 's @entity111 cathedral was nowhere to be seen on @entity5 's map of the @entity115 city			1
mr @entity6 agreed , telling a conference in @entity117 : ' i tried to navigate somewhere , and i could n't get to where i wanted to by voice			0
' so , i was a little disappointed , because i love navigation by voice with my @entity90 [ @entity55 ] phones , actually , since they always get it and are based on a better database			0
' it was such a fiasco that @entity5 subsequently sacked @entity126 , the executive in charge of its mapping app. @entity100 has n't been mr @entity6 's only target			1
earlier last year he had also expressed his disappointment with @entity84 , the @entity1 's virtual personal assistant			0
he said that he had been a fan of @entity84 , but that it had got worse since @entity5 had bought it			2
he told a reporter that @entity84 had impressed him when he asked it how many prime numbers greater than 87 there are			0
when @entity84 answered the question correctly , @entity6 enthused : ' it 's incredible			0
it 's like it understands " greater than "			0
' but he said that since @entity5 had bought @entity84 , ' a lot of people say @entity84			2
i say poo - poo , ' he said			0
mr @entity6 is not alone is criticising @entity5 for a lack of innovation			2
since the death of @entity10 in october 2011 , many have felt that the @entity9 giant - which has a cash pile of $ 137 billion ( £ 87 billion ) , only £ 3.7m smaller than the entire economic output of @entity155 - is falling behind			0
analyst @entity156 at @entity157 said in november : ' @entity5 's innovation is sputtering			1
' why is that @entity5 , the company that brought touch to phones and tablets , stopped just there and did not bring touch to notebooks and imacs ? @entity6 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) founded @entity5 in a garage in @entity9 and went on to launch first the @entity168 and then the @entity5 computers , which helped established computers in the mainstream ' why is it that @entity5 brought high - resolution screens to some @entity174 and not to all devices ? ' the company 's ongoing battle with @entity25 has turned off both fans and investors , while lacklustre product launches such as the @entity181 have sparked suggestions that the @entity9 company has lost its way since the death of @entity10			1
@entity5 's quarterly results , announced at the end of last month , disappointed investors			1
although the figures were very good by any other business 's standards ( revenues were up 18 per cent on the previous quarter ) flat profits led to a sense of unease about @entity5 languishing on innovation.the company 's shares fell 11 per cent the day those results were announced and have yet to make a significant recovery .			1
