by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity2 's new coach @entity1 finished wednesday ’s friendly against @entity3 with 10 youth - team players on the pitch and seems determined to give youth its chance			1
he knows this is a make or break season at @entity2 with @entity23 looking out of a favour and @entity2 unlikely to bring in a new specialist right - back			1
big opportunity : @entity16 ( left ) has a chance to become @entity2 's new first - choice right - back @entity30 ( 18 ) very highly thought of at @entity2 and the eventual successor to @entity32			1
he offers the same attacking threat from deep although it might still be a while before he ’s ahead of the @entity37 international			0
@entity38 ( 20 ) ticks at least two of the @entity2 defender boxes because he can also play at right - back and the comes out from the back with great confidence			1
also defends well but there is no imminent step - up on the horizon			0
@entity47 ( 16 ) after bettering @entity49 ’s youth team scoring statistics @entity47 put most of the top teams in @entity52 on alert with his finshing , his speed and his intelligence			0
unfortunately for @entity2 , @entity57 were also alerted to the way he was brought from @entity60 to @entity61 , and the game ’s governing body say their rules on the relocation of young players parents were broken so he can only play in friendlies until he turns 18			1
he looks set to stay at @entity2 however and those who have watched his development since arriving in 2011 believe if he continues to progress it will be well worth the wait			2
@entity74 ( 19 ) a graduate of @entity2 ’s @entity77 academy set up by @entity78 , @entity74 is lightning quick but like @entity38 not expected to step up to the first team despite @entity2 ’s shortcomings in the centre of defence			2
@entity83 ( 19 ) perhaps the pick of the bunch			0
keeps possession well but not at the expense of moving the ball forward purposefully			0
should make the step up at some point soon			0
big things expected of a midfielder who @entity2 have tied to the club until 2017 and have no intention of letting go despite interest from the @entity97			1
more to come : defensive midfielder @entity83 ( right ) is one of @entity2 's brightest prospects @entity99 ( 22 ) stepped up to the first team squad last season but without really taking his chance and may not be far from the crossroads of a move away from @entity2 on loan to show he can take the next step			1
another tidy midfielder but needs to show he can also drive a team forward			0
@entity111 was a big fan and looked at taking him to @entity112 last year			0
wanted : midfielder @entity99 ( right ) was considered by @entity112 boss @entity111 last summer @entity113 ( 18 ) plays wide left or through the middle and was the only youngster to start for @entity2 against @entity3 – ahead of @entity116 who @entity1 says still needs to improve defensively			1
he showed plenty of intelligent running and was played in twice for goalscoring chances but failed to take his chance both times			0
impossible to step up with so much talent ahead of him			0
battle : @entity113 ( left ) played well against @entity3 but he is unlikely to break into @entity1 's first xi @entity13 ( 18 ) much is expected of the @entity130 national team ’s youngest ever debutant who will play for @entity2 ’s b - team this season but with an eye to a fast - track to the first team			1
can play wide in the front three but far more comfortable in midfield where his left - foot passing range can cut teams open			0
bright future : @entity141 @entity13 ( right ) is expected to become a star at the @entity143 @entity144 ( 18 ) the jury is split on @entity144			2
is he the next big thing to come out of football club @entity2 or does he just look so good at b - team level because he is so much quicker and stronger than his peers ? if his footballing brain develops to match his pace , power and skill he will soon make the step - up			1
a season on loan similar to @entity156 's at @entity157 might help that process			2
on the move : winger @entity144 could benefit from first - team football on loan at another club @entity163 announces his retirement click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			2

@entity2 finished with 10 youth players on the pitch against @entity3
manager @entity1 is keen to use the club 's young players next season
@entity16 , @entity99 and @entity113 among talented players *hoping* to make *breakthrough* at the @entity143
@entity2 lost 1 - 0 to @entity182 's men in @entity183
