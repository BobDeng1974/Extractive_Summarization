three times as many young people are needing hospital treatment for @entity5 's disease today than a decade ago , medics say			1
@entity7 star @entity6 is a well - documented sufferer junk food and antibiotics are being blamed by doctors for the rise in the number of young people developing a serious digestive disorder			1
the latest figures show three times as many young people need hospital treatment for @entity19 today than a decade ago			1
dr @entity20 , a consultant gastroenterologist at @entity21 in @entity22 , said there has also been a big rise in the number diagnosed with the condition – and diet is partly responsible			0
‘ if you have a lot of junk food it actually makes it more likely that you will develop @entity33 ’s disease , ’ she said			1
‘ and people have noticed those who have lots of antibiotics – particularly in younger life – also seem to be more likely to develop this condition			2
’ @entity33 ’s , which is caused by inflammation of the lining of the digestive system , triggers frequent bouts of diarrhoea , abdominal pain , fatigue and bleeding			1
along with colitis , it is a form of inflammatory bowel disease ( @entity51 ) and may be diagnosed at any age			0
however it tends to strike early in life and there is no cure			0
it is not clear how eating junk food , typically high in animal fat or saturated fats , can lead to the disease , but doctors believe it pushes up the chances of genetically susceptible people developing it			1
‘ all the centres that get lots of referrals have noticed an increase over the last few decades , ’ dr @entity20 said , adding that there are many genes which can predispose someone to the condition			0
‘ we try to keep patients fit enough to stay at home , but because of the increased number being diagnosed , the actual number needing to be admitted has gone up , ’ she said			0
new data – obtained by the @entity81 from the @entity82 – show in 2003/4 there were 4,937 young adults aged between 16 and 29 admitted to hospitals in @entity86 for the condition			0
this rose to 19,405 in 2012/13			0
three - quarters of those with @entity33 ’s , which affects around 250,000 @entity91 , will need bowel reconstructive surgery at some point in their lives			2
@entity33 's , which is caused by inflammation of the lining of the digestive system , triggers frequent bouts of diarrhoea , abdominal pain , fatigue and bleeding however , a spokesman for the charity @entity33 said that while the prevalence of @entity51 has been increasing in recent years , there are many contributory causes – including genetic predisposition which can be triggered by environmental factors			1
he added : ‘ dietary issues certainly can play a role , but there is no evidence they are the main cause			0
the gut bacteria can be radically altered in people with @entity33 ’s and colitis – with an increase in harmful bacteria and fewer beneficial bacteria which may also be significant			2
’ he said that the charity had been contacted by many patients who say they have always maintained a healthy diet , and who would disagree with the idea that junk food is behind the rise in cases .			2
