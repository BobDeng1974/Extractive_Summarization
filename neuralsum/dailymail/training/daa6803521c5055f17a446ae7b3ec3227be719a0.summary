by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the @entity2 will have a huge task in front of them tonight as they attempt to level the series with the @entity7			1
@entity12 analysts @entity10 and @entity13 agree that now third best player @entity14 is missing the series with an injury , @entity9 ' squad are over-reliant on star duo @entity17 and @entity18			1
the @entity7 dominated in game one on their way to a blowout 122 - 105 victory			0
over-reliant : the @entity2 are too reliant on star duo @entity17 and @entity18 and must find a way to have a reliable third scoring option after the injury to @entity14 missing : thunder forward @entity14 will miss the series with the @entity7 because of injury ' you just ca n't rely on @entity17 and @entity18 because coach pop ( @entity30 ) will live with those guys getting 70 points and seeing where that other 30 is going to come from , ' said @entity10 an @entity34 who is now an analyst for @entity36			1
@entity14 is suffering with an injured calf and is not expected to play in this series			1
he is the @entity2 's best inside defender and also their third option on offence			1
the @entity41 was averaging 12 points , seven rebounds and two blocks before injuring himself			0
@entity45 started in his place in the game one defeat , but had no points in just 15 minutes of play			1
@entity10 added : ' you would assume it would be @entity53 ( to pick up the scoring slack )			1
he 's had his way with the @entity7 in the regular season , he averaged 21 points and shot almost 60 per cent in their four games			0
third option : @entity53 could be the one to take up some of the scoring slack ' if you 're going to start @entity64 , @entity45 and @entity65 those guys ca n't have five points combined , because then you 're playing two against five			1
' if you 're the @entity7 you can load against @entity18 and @entity17			0
but if those guys score 5 - 7 pts each then it 's a little bit different because you 've got to play everyone honest			2
' @entity10 , a five - time all - star with the @entity73 , added : ' i see @entity75 being a player with potential in this series			2
i could see him being the type of player getting you seven - 10 points			0
but it 's got to be by committee whoever that third scorer is going to be			0
' @entity86 power forward @entity85 , 38 , scored a game - high 27 points in the opener , with @entity14 's absence allowing @entity85 to get a number of good , open looks			1
the best ever : @entity85 , 38 , scored a game - high 27 points in game one of the @entity97 finals @entity13 , who played on six teams in a 10 - year career , said : ' you have to start by acknowledging that he 's the greatest power forward to ever play the game			1
the most dominant two - way player we 've had at that position without a doubt			0
' i have no idea how he 's been able to continue at that level ( despite his age )			0
pop has been phenomenal to help balance that but it comes down to him being a consummate professional			0
' @entity10 added : ' what i love about @entity85 is that it 's always been about fundamentals throughout his career			1
' he was n't like @entity121 ( @entity122 ) or ( @entity124 ) @entity123 who had great athleticism or brute strength , he played a thinking man 's game			2
' it shows if you have great footwork , if you can think the game , you can play at a very high level for a very long time			2
there 's not been a huge drop off because he never had to rely on athleticism , it was more of a chess game for him , whereas a lot of guys have been playing checkers throughout their careers			2
' disruption : if the @entity2 are to stand a chance tonight they have to find a way to disrupt the @entity7 @entity13 does believe that the @entity2 have a chance to steal tonight 's game , however			1
' the @entity7 are the most difficult team to guard in the @entity12 because the ball finds the right guy , ' @entity13 , also an @entity12 analyst , said			1
' you do n't know where the shot is going to come from when you face @entity7 becasue their ball movement is so flawless and their spacing is terrific			0
' that 's the challenge for @entity2 , defensively they have to disrupt timing and spacing			2
can you throw them off , get deflections , contain them , get them out of rhythm			0
if you can do that you can have success			0
' @entity168 two tips off tonight at 2am			0
