the day before mrs @entity3 was found dead , @entity19 went to her husband 's medical surgery in @entity37 and asked for $ 3,500 but dr @entity3 refused to pay before the job was done			1

' please , whatever you can give me , doctor , ' she recalled @entity19 saying in a ' softer voice than normal			0
' ' @entity72 then came in and asked my mum for $ 200 and he walked outside with the intention to give it to @entity75			0
' a month before the conversation , @entity27 was interrupted by a ' relatively loud ' discussion between her father and @entity19 , which lasted about half an hour , the court heard			1
' that was a conversation about the quoting of the job , ' she said			0
@entity27 said @entity19 had also spoken to her about being thousands of dollars in debt			2
@entity19 's barrister @entity84 asked if @entity27 would do ' whatever it takes to secure conviction ? ' ' i think it would be yes for anyone in my situation , ' she replied			2
@entity27 ( pictured leavng the court on thursday ) said her mother did n't trust @entity19 @entity19 , who has pleaded not guilty to the murder , had arrived at the home in @entity25 - a little known but wealthy suburb in northwest @entity9 - at about 7.40 that morning then dr @entity3 left to go to his surgery about 9am			1
@entity19 is alleged to have told police that three armed intruders stormed into the house telling him ‘ do n't worry , we are not here for you ’ and then he said the men ordered him to ‘ get her ’			2
so @entity19 then grabbed mrs @entity3 by the hair and dragged her , ‘ kicking and screaming ’			1
the last time he saw her , @entity19 said she had tears streaming down her face and a gun to her head			0
‘ she was in fear for her life , ’ he said			0
@entity19 said he then went to his car , smoked a cigarette and waited to see if the men came out , then about 40 minutes later he left the property			0
@entity27 said she had heard @entity19 begging her father dr @entity2 ( pictured outside the court ) for money two months before her mother was killed on the opening day of his trial on tuesday , the @entity28 heard the labourer contacted police a year after he was charged with the crime and said he had ‘ more information ’ about that fatal day on june 15 , 2012			1
it was one of three inconsistent versions of events that the financially - stressed @entity19 gave after mrs @entity3 was bashed to death inside her home , crown prosecutor @entity124 told the jury on tuesday			1
when @entity27 came home from work at 2pm , she found her mother on the floor near her bed with her face and mouth covered in blood and bruises - she was cold to touch			2

crown prosecutor @entity124 ( pictured ) said @entity19 took $ 3,400 from the home which mrs @entity3 was organising the money to pay her husband 's staff around the time of the attack mr @entity124 said @entity19 fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain dna and crime scene evidence at the time of mrs @entity3 's death , the court heard she had been organising the money to pay her husband 's staff and had about $ 3,400 in envelopes in the home			1
' the crown case is that the money was taken at the time of or moments after the attack on mrs @entity3 and that it was the accused who took that money , ' mr @entity124 said			0
the crown says @entity19 's business was $ 97,000 in debt			0
after police questioned him about the murder , mr @entity124 said he fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain dna and crime scene evidence			0
but mr @entity84 questioned that @entity19 's financial difficulties provided a motive			0
' what does common sense tell you about a robbery worth $ 2000 to $ 4000 ? ... is that a motive to kill the wife of your employer ? ' he said			0

@entity19 was hired to concrete dr @entity2 ’s driveway
@entity19 asked for $ 3,500 but dr @entity3 refused to pay until the job was complete in their multi-million dollar waterfront home in @entity25 , @entity9
