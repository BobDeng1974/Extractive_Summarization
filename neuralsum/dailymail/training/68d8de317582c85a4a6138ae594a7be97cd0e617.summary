by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 12:56 est , 8 june 2012 every mother knows about the risks of delivering a baby prematurely			0
a baby born even a month earlier than it is due , or preemie as we know it , can develop pneumonia , poor vision and hearing , sleep problems and may even die			2
and that 's not all			0
now a major study published in the journal @entity17 says preterm babies can develop severe mental health problems too			1
increased risk : babies born more than eight weeks premature are ' 4.5 times as likely ' to suffer from a severe mental illness such as depression , bipolar disorder or psychosis this is the first study of its kind to show a link between premature babies and a broad range of psychiatric disorders in later life			1
they are at a high risk of developing bipolar disorders , severe depression and even eating disorders			0
researchers say that subtle alterations in the brain development caused by early birth could be responsible for the problem , rather than restricted growth or lack of oxygen during childbirth			0
the news has left doctors in @entity51 concerned , in view of the surge in births of premature babies			1
' there has been a 10 per cent rise in preemies because of different lifestyle - related health problems pregnant women suffer from			1
' gestational diabetes , polycystic ovaries , hypertension and cases of amniotic fluid leaks are common now and these are the high risk factors for a premature delivery			2
' late pregnancy is another reason for this worrying trend , ' said dr @entity71 , consultant gynaecologist , @entity73 hospital			0
doctors are concerned about rising numbers of premature babies - which are defined as being born at least three weeks early ideally , a baby should be delivered close to the 40th week , but babies are being delivered as early as the 32nd week			1
the study finds that babies born four to eight weeks earlier are more likely to develop schizophrenia and bipolar disorders and those born after just 32 weeks in the womb are three times more likely to have a psychiatric disorder by the age of 16			1
' premature babies are kept in neonatal care from between a week to a month			1
' they are away from the vital pheromones that their mothers secrete and this could be the reason for psychological problems later			2
' these babies are generally of low weight at birth and that impacts their health a lot , ' said dr @entity101 , director , @entity102			1
while pediatricians are able to save preemies with the advancement in the neonatal technology , there is hardly any followup on their health later			0
' we have no clue on what happens to our preterm babies			0
in @entity114 , there is no proper large - scale study on their health status , ' said dr @entity101			2
health experts pointed out that it is important to identify susceptible children and keep track of their health status .			0
