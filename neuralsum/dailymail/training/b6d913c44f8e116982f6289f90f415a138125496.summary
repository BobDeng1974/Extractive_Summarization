for his 50th birthday , @entity0 was probably expecting a slap - up meal or a romantic break			2
instead , all his wife @entity4 gave him was a wicker box containing 50 brightly coloured pieces of paper			1
on each was written a small challenge to be done in order throughout the year			1
they ranged from the routine ( baking a loaf ) , to the daring ( skinny - dipping ) and the bizarre ( talking like a pirate , volunteering for a police identity parade )			1
the tasks were devised to fit in around work , holidays and family life in @entity32 with the couple ’s 15 - year - old son and eight - year - old daughter			1
@entity36 , a writer , said the idea was to make the year ‘ unique and out of the ordinary ’			2
she said : ‘ as you get older it can be easy to get in a groove and this has really jolted him out of it			0
’ so on mr @entity0 ’s 50th birthday last january , she presented him with the challenges			0
one of his favourites was photographing ten strangers , asking permission first , on a family holiday to @entity52			0
miss @entity4 said it gave them an ‘ insight into life in @entity57 ’			1
mr @entity0 's challenges included eating a whole lobster , left , and sending a message in a bottle , right oddly , it was one of the challenges designed to be relaxing and indulgent that caused schoolbook editor mr @entity0 his worst moment – taking a leisurely bath			0
miss @entity4 said : ‘ i ran him a bath but only put the hot water in			1
i told him to put some cold in but he did n’t hear me and scalded his foot			0
he then managed to pull the plug out and ended up sitting in a few inches of cold water			0
he got out and said it was rubbish			0
’ mr @entity0 said : ‘ i do like the idea of challenging myself and i ’m thinking about doing something bigger this year			2
’ miss @entity4 said : ‘ it has been a really good year seeing him try new things that take him out of his comfort zone			1
’ when she turned 50 in october , her present was more conventional – a bicycle			0
the couple held a joint 50th birthday party in july at which mr @entity0 played a song he had composed as one of his tasks			0
he has one challenge left – writing his wife a love letter with 50 things he likes about her			1
miss @entity4 said : ‘ i think i deserve that after coming up with all the challenges			2
