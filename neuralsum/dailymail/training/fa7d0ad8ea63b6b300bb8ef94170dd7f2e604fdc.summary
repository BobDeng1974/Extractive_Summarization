by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 14:39 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 24 august 2012 @entity4 's daughter @entity3 told @entity5 to quit as boss of @entity7 because of the phone hacking scandal			1
ms @entity9 also suggested her brother @entity10 stepped down as chairman because harmful publicity was badly damaging her father 's business , she revealed last night			1
infamously it was claimed she had ‘ railed ’ against ms @entity5 and told her she had ‘ f * * * * d the company ’ , but the media mogul 's daughter denied this happened when she spoke at the @entity17			1
but both did eventually resign in 2011 , after the closure of the @entity24			2
warning : last night at the @entity17 @entity9 , left , admitted she told @entity5 , right , to resign but denied telling her she had ' f * * * * * the company ' asked if it was true that she had advised @entity10 to step back and ms @entity5 to resign during a question and answer session , she said : ' yes , it is , but ... it was said within closed walls and @entity5 did resign			1
' ms @entity9 , who is the third member of her family to give the landmark address to the tv industry , said one reason for giving it was to make sure ' not everybody is tarred or marked with the same brush '			1
asked if she had ever said @entity10 or ms @entity5 had f * * * * * the company , she said : ' no , for the record , absolutely not			1
' bold : @entity9 warned that ' profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster ' ms @entity9 said it had been ' a nightmare year for the family ' but she was aware it had ' not been as difficult for us as for the people who have been victims or @entity54 ’s parents '			1
tensions : @entity9 appeared to criticise her brother @entity57 's attitude to business last night she said she was ' pleased ' her father had told a parliamentary select committee that giving evidence was ' the most humble day ' of his life			1
she said : ' i know he absolutely meant it and it was , if i ’m honest as a daughter , heart - breaking			0
' the bitter tensions within the @entity4 clan were when @entity9 warned that ‘ profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster ’			1
she was responding to a speech her brother gave three years ago , delivering the same lecture , where he had claimed the free market alone would guarantee innovation and independence as he also hit out at the ‘ chilling ’ scale of the @entity82			2
but in what many will see as a further dig at her brother , she said ‘ global society ’ needed to ‘ reject the idea that money is the only effective measure of all things or that the free market is the only sorting mechanism ’			2
she was even in danger of siding with traditional @entity4 enemies such as the @entity82 and left - wing playwrights , in what many will see as her attempt to distance herself from their perceived failings			0
industry figures believe she wishes to become the anointed heir to her father ’s empire			0
miss @entity9 also admitted her father ’s company @entity104 , which owned the @entity24 and also owns her production company , was ‘ currently asking itself some very significant and difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values			1
’ the 44 - year - old also warned of the threat to press freedom from ‘ enemies within ’ - a remark that will be widely seen as a criticism of @entity7 employees caught up in the phone hacking scandal that has rocked the business			1
difficult questions : @entity9 , pictured with her father @entity4 and his second wife @entity123 , admitted her father 's company @entity104 was asking itself some ' difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values ' in what appeared to be a further acknowledgement of how the allegations of phone hacking have devastated the family firm , she added that ‘ personally ’ she thought one of the biggest lessons had been the need for organisations to ‘ discuss , affirm and institutionalise a rigorous set of values ’ based on an explicit ‘ statement of purpose ’			1
in a stark contrast to her brother ’s 2009 speech she heaped praise on the @entity82 saying she was a ‘ current supporter of the universal licence fee ’ and praised the ‘ vision and leadership ’ of @entity147 , the outgoing director general			0
@entity149 contrast : unlike her brother , miss @entity9 praised the @entity82 and its outgoing director general , @entity147 in what many in the industry regard as a subtle attack on her father , she also quoted with approval another former @entity157 speaker , @entity156 who said television should ‘ make hearts pound ’			1
the playwright famously used his lecture to demand her father be put on trial and even named his cancer @entity164 after him			0
she also quoted the playwright @entity165 and described him as ‘ wonderful ’ , despite his lengthy and public feud with her father			0
@entity165 famously branded him a “ bully that should be stood up to publicly ” and refused an honorary degree from @entity170 because the magnate has funded a position there			0
it was unclear if the @entity176 boss had told her father and brother what was in the speech before she delivered it			1
miss @entity9 spoke about her brother @entity183 ’s speech , giving the same lecture three years ago , in which he attacked the ‘ land - grab ’ of the @entity82 and said that the only real guarantee of independence was profit and commercial competition			1
but miss @entity9 said of the licence fee : ‘ a few have even questioned the legitimacy of the mandatory levy			2
however , despite a valuable contribution to this debate – @entity10 ended his lecture with a line in which he claimed that the only reliable and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit			2
‘ he clearly intended the statement to be provocative , and it is , but i also think that it deserves further analysis , ‘ @entity10 was right that if you remove profit , then independence is massively challenged but i think that he left something out : the reason his statement sat so uncomfortably is that profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster			2
’ she added : ‘ do we have such faith in the imperatives of the market that we need have no will of our own other than to succeed on its terms			0
it ’s us , human beings , we the people , who create the society we want , not profit			0
’ ‘ it is increasingly apparent that the absence of purpose - or of a moral language – within government , media or business , could become one of the most dangerous own goals for capitalism and for freedom			0
’ family outing : media mogul @entity4 , centre , stands behind his children @entity183 , right , and @entity9 , left , at the @entity239 races in 2010 she also criticised the ‘ sometimes self - serving relationships ’ between police , politics , media or banking			2
but she said despite such an ‘ unsettling dearth of integrity ’ across so many institutions , which has been explored by the @entity249 enquiry , ‘ the right outcome ’ must be ‘ the fierce protection of a free press and light touch media regulation ’			0
she added , in what many will interpret as a criticism of senior executives at @entity7 , that : ‘ sadly the greatest threats to our free society are too often from enemies within			2
’ the tv boss admitted @entity104 , which owned the @entity24 and also owns her production company , was ‘ currently asking itself some very significant and difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values			0
’ miss @entity9 added independence from regulation is only ‘ democratically viable ’ when ‘ we accept that we have a responsibility to each other and not just to our bottom line ’			2
she said profit should be the ‘ servant ’ not the ‘ master ’			0
miss @entity9 , who reportedly claimed @entity7 chief @entity5 had ' f * * * * d the company ' , also warned of the threat to press freedom from ' enemies within ' she said that ‘ personally ’ she thought one of the biggest lessons had been the need for organisations to ‘ discuss , affirm and institutionalise a rigorous set of values ’ based on an explicit ‘ statement of purpose ’			1
miss @entity9 became the third member of her family - following father @entity164 and brother @entity10 - to make the celebrated @entity157 lecture at the @entity17			1
she founded production company shine which is responsible for shows including @entity296 and @entity297			0
in the speech she said : ‘ let ’s see what the @entity249 enquiry recommends but when there has been such an unsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our institutions , it is very difficult to argue for the right outcome - which must be the fierce protection of a free press and light touch media regulation			0
sadly the greatest threats to our free society are too often from enemies within			0
’ the speech ended with a hymn of praise to her father telling how he ‘ had the vision , the will and the sense of purpose to challenge the old world order on behalf of ‘ the people ’			0
her often deeply personal remarks included a reference to the family ’s position as ‘ permanent outsiders and constant nomads but in ‘ pursuit of a greater good - a belief in better			0

@entity9 also suggested her brother @entity10 resign as bad publicity was damaging her father 's company , @entity7
' it was said within closed walls and @entity5 did resign , ' she told the @entity17
but she said the infamous story that she told ms @entity5 she *'d* had ' f * * * * * the company ' was *untrue*
