a six - year - old girl from @entity1 , who lost part of her leg when she was run over by a lawnmower , will be able to walk again thanks to a rare surgical procedure			1
@entity8 's left leg was mangled by the mower after her grandfather accidentally went over her as she played in his garden on may 1			1
the damage was so severe that at first surgeons thought they may have to amputate it from the hip but , thanks to a rarely performed operation , the little girl will soon be back on her feet			1
steps to recovery : @entity22 , left , with her six - year - old , @entity8 , who lost part of her leg when her grandfather ran over her on a mower @entity8 has had seven operations already on her leg since arriving at the @entity27 hospital by air ambulance at the start of the month			1
when her grandfather , @entity31 , realized he had run over the six - year - old he used his belt as a tourniquet and told @entity8 's grandmother to stay away because of the shocking injuries			1
the mower had ripped a large hole in her leg , damaging bone and muscle and making doctors question whether they could save the limb			2
eventually , they decided to use rotationplasty - an eight - hour procedure in which a section of the leg around the knee joint is removed , and the lower leg is rotated and reattached so the foot is facing backwards			1
doctors say that the procedure is the best hope @entity8 will have of walking again , because the ankle will work as a knee joint and fit into a prosthetic			1
when asked if she understood what was going to be done to her , @entity8 said : ' yeah , it means my foot is going to be in a different place ... will i be able to run ? ' brave : @entity22 , pictured with @entity8 , says she has been moved by her little girl 's courageous attitude as she recovers from the horrific accident surgery : @entity8 is recovering from an operation to remove and reattach part of her leg in an effort to give her greater mobility when she has a prosthetic fitted the little girl 's courageous attitude has helped her family get through the trauma of the past few weeks			1
@entity75 is a complicated procedure in which part of the leg is removed and then reattached to the body			2
it is usually performed on young cancer patients because it allows tumors to be removed without the need for amputation			2
a section of the leg around the knee joint is removed			2
the lower part of the leg is then rotated and reattached to the body , so the foot is facing backwards			0
this allows the ankle joint to simulate the way a knee moves , making learning to walk on a prosthetic easier			2
nerves in the foot also continue to send signals to the brain about movement			0
inplants are added to the new top half of the leg so that the reattached limb can be adjusted as the child grows			0
' i was supposed to be strong for her , but it was the other way around , ' her mom , @entity22 , told the @entity109			0
' i ’ve gone through every emotion , and the one thing i ’ve learned is that crying does n’t help			0
i ’m trying to be like her			0
' ms @entity22 had been on the first day of a vacation to @entity114 when her daughter was injured			0
her parents tried to hide the extent of @entity8 's injuries from her , telling ms @entity22 only that she needed to return as soon as possible			1
' they did n't want us to travel all day knowing how bad it was			0
they just told us that she had been in an accident and we 'd need to come right home , ' ms @entity22 told @entity124			0
the procedure @entity8 is having done is usually performed on young cancer patients as a way to remove tumors without them losing their whole leg			1
surgeons who carry out the complicated operation , which involves attaching the shin to the thigh , and then making sure all the nerves and muscles meet up , usually have at least a month to prepare			2
but in @entity8 's case , they had just two days			1
' we did n't have a lot to work with , ' orthopedic surgeon @entity138 said			0
surgery : a medical diagram shows how rotationplasty works , by removing an upper section of leg and then reattaching the lower half with the foot facing backwards so the ankle can replicate the knee joint the surgeon added : ' you get to keep and use as much of the real leg as possible			2
it takes less energy to get used to and allows someone to be more active and functional			0
' @entity8 is still recovering from the operation , but in about two months she will have a prosthetic fitted and begin to learn to walk again			1
a fund has been set up to help with her hospital and rehabilitation costs , and to pay towards the $ 20,000 prosthetic and alterations to the family home to help her move around more easily			0
a @entity165 account has been set up in the family 's name , and can be reached via @entity168 .			0

surgeons used rotationplasty to save @entity8 from having her whole limp amputated
procedure will make it easier for @entity8 to learn to run and play again
