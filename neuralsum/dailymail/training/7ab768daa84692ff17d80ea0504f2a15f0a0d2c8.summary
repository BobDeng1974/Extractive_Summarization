@entity9 , cutlery and music contribute at least as much to the enjoyment of a meal as the food itself , studies show			2
volunteers who ate a strawberry dessert from a white plate thought it tasted 10 per cent sweeter than those who ate the same pudding from a black one			2
according to the study popcorn tastes less salty if served in a red container than a blue one @entity26 psychologist professor @entity25 , who carried out the experiments , also found that food tasted better when it was eaten with heavy cutlery and crockery			1
he said : ‘ for years , we have been spending a lot of time thinking about the taste and colour and sound of the food itself			1
‘ that is all very important but there is a whole area emerging that it seems that no one has ever thought about – the everything else that goes with food			2
‘ we never eat food by itself , it is always with cutlery , on a plate that ’s on a table			1
‘ and when you change these things it seems to matter			0
’ a series of experiments carried out by @entity52 show that something as simple as the colour of a plate or the weight of a spoon can make a difference			2
@entity60 desserts taste 10 per cent sweeter on a white plate than a black one according to the research in the experiments , popcorn tastes saltier when eaten from a blue bowl than from a red one			1
professor @entity25 , who has worked with a variety of top chefs including @entity69 , said that colour contrast may play a part in the phenomenon			1
force of habit may also be important			0
salty crisps are often packaged in blue bags , perhaps explaining why the popcorn tasted saltier when eaten from a blue bowl			0
weight is also important , with heavier cutlery and crockery making food taste more appealing			0
professor @entity25 said : ‘ if you make the spoon heavier , the food tastes better and if you make the bowl heavier , the food tastes better			1
' this may be because we tend to associate weight with worth			0
those planning a dinner party , the professor advises spending at least as much time thinking about the table setting as they do on the food			1
he says that when everything from the colour of the plates to the weight of the cutlery is factored in , at least half of the enjoyment of a meal may lay in how it is served rather than in how it tastes			0
other ideas include matching the background music to the wine			0
research from the @entity107 and @entity108 concluded that @entity109 is all the more delicious when accompanied by @entity110 ’ classic people are @entity112			0
the high pitch and fast beat of @entity115 by @entity116 is said to enhance the taste of @entity118 and @entity119 , while @entity121 ’s @entity120 might help @entity123 slide down more smoothly			0
and professor @entity25 has shown that @entity125 ’s rendition of @entity126 brings out the tanginess of dark chocolate and coffee - flavoured desserts .			1

new study shows food tastes different depending on what plate its on
professor @entity25 advised those planning a dinner party to spend as much time on the table setting as the food
