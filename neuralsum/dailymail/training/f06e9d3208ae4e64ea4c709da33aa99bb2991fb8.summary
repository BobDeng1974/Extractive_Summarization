masters in the dark arts of espionage and silent assassination , they are rarely seen and never heard ... until they strike			0
employed by samurai warlords to spy , sabotage and kill , they are relics of an ancient code that have all but died out in the modern age			1
as the 21st head of the @entity13 clan , a dynasty of secret spies that can trace its history back some 500 years , 63 - year - old engineer @entity10 is @entity18 's last ninja			1
he is trained to hear a needle drop in the next room , to disappear in a cloud of smoke or to cut a victim 's throat from 20 paces with nothing more than a two - inch ' death star '			1
' ninjas proper no longer exist			1
' but @entity10 has decided to let the art die with him because ninjas ' just do n't fit with modern day ' , adding : ' we ca n’t try out murder or poisons			1
even if we can follow the instructions to make a poison , we ca n’t try it out			2
' an engineer by trade , @entity10 started practicing the art of @entity53 at the age of six before he began training under the gruelling regime of @entity58 master @entity57			1
to improve his concentration , he would spend hours staring into the flame of a candle until he felt he was inside it			1
silent and deadly : @entity10 is trained to hear a needle drop in the next room , to disappear in a cloud of smoke and to cut a victim 's throat from 20 paces with nothing but a three - inch death star tough training : as part of his training , @entity10 climbed walls , jumped from heights and learned how to mix chemicals to cause explosions and smoke and was also trained to withstand extreme heat and cold as well as go for days without food or water to hone his hearing he would practice listening to a needle being dropped onto a wooden floor in the next room			1
ninjas , also known as @entity88 , have been feared and revered throughout history for their talents as assassins , scouts and spies			2
they are mainly noted for their use of stealth , their dark outfits usually covering everything but their eyes , leaving them virtually invisible in shadow , until they struck			0
but they were also known for their amazing powers of endurance			0
@entity53 can be translated as ‘ @entity104 ' but also means ‘ art of enduring '			2
the ninjas themselves were noted for being able to walk long distances without stopping , jump over seven feet and dislocate their joints to escape from small spaces			2
but they were not only ruthless killers as depicted in so many @entity114 movies			0
in fact , ninjas considered the art of espionage far greater than that of fighting which was always a last resort - ninjas were skilled in spying and defeating foes using intelligence , while swinging a sword was deemed a lower art. and they were also skilled at making poisons as well as potions and medicines			1

' the training was all tough and painful			2
it was n't fun but i did n't think much why i was doing it			2
training was made to be part of my life , ' he said			2
and at the age of 19 , he inherited his master 's title along with a cache of secret scrolls and ancient tools			1
but he says the art of the ninja lies in the power of surprise , never brute force or outward strength and is about exploiting weaknesses to outfox larger , more powerful opponents while distracting their attention to get the upper hand			0
and , he says , the ability to hide in the most unlikely of places is a ninja 's greatest weapon			0
' if you throw a toothpick , people will look that way , giving you the chance to flee , he adds			0
' we also have a saying that it is possible to escape death by perching on your enemy 's eyelashes ; it means you are so close that he can not see you			0
' @entity10 now runs the @entity179 , in @entity179 , 220 miles southwest of @entity180 and recently began a research job at the state - run @entity182 , where he is studying the history of ninjas			1
he says he has decided not to take on an apprentice to pass on the legacy , making him the last in the line of @entity13 clan ninjas			1
