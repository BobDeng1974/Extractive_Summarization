@entity0 , a @entity1 mp for @entity2 , said new waves of immigration were replacing the ' white working class ' pubs are closing because traditionally white working class areas have become home to mainly @entity11 immigrants , a minister has said			1
@entity0 , a minister in the @entity12 , said pubs had shut down in his constituency after a wave of @entity17 migration			1
the @entity1 , who represents a constituency in @entity2 , said it was pointless trying to protect all pubs from closing because many had been abandoned by the new communities living around them			1
in a @entity26 debate yesterday he told mps that new waves of immigration were replacing the ' white working class ' in some areas â€“ meaning some pub closures were inevitable			2
mr @entity0 ' remarks came as the government unveiled to stop pubs being demolished or converted which are deemed valuable to local communities			1
he said ' blanket protection ' of every pub was impossible because it would mean keeping some open which had long become redundant			0
he said : ' in my own constituency , lots of pubs have closed but it is usually because of demographic change , ' said the minister , who represents a seat in @entity2			1
' particularly in some parts of my constituency , which used to have ... ' a white working class community ' 20 or 30 years ago are now populated primarily by recently - arrived @entity17 and other people			2
' obviously the pubs in that area have closed			2
some have been converted to other uses , some of them actually are still derelict			0
' the remarks come after @entity60 peer @entity58 sparked controversy after claiming the growing @entity11 population was one of the main reasons for the problems hitting the pub trade			1
lord @entity58 said pubs are under threat in areas such as @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 a series of amendments to the @entity75 were tabled including a cross-party effort to ensure pubs and other drinking establishments could not be demolished or have their use changed without planning permission			1
lord @entity58 , who is a former brewery boss , said pubs are closing in areas with growing @entity11 communities			1
former brewery boss @entity58 , pictured , has blamed the increasing size of @entity87 's @entity11 population for the growing rate of pub closures speaking in the @entity92 , the peer - a former director of pub chain @entity91 - said : ' twenty - five years ago , the company of which i was a director would have operated probably a dozen pubs in @entity96 , the home of the carpet trade			1
the carpet trade has gone and there are three pubs left			2
' in areas of @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity103 , @entity69 and @entity72 the increase in the @entity11 population who do n't drink leads to many pub closures			1
' it is exceptionally hard for a publican who has put 10 years of his life into trying to build up a business to accept the inevitability of these tides of history			0
' he said the issue was one of the three main reasons pubs were going out of business , along with the ' inexorable rise of regulation ' and the availability of low price alcohol in supermarkets			0
he added : ' the reasons for closure may be portrayed as rapacious owners increasing rent wishing to profit by turning pubs into houses or corner stores , but the tide is running against the ordinary pub. ' lord @entity58 said there was a danger companies would not invest in improving pubs if landlords could opt out of tied arrangements			1
' no pub owner is going to invest many thousands of pounds , hundreds of thousands of pounds in some cases , if the tenant can then walk away from supplier agreements , ' he said			0
@entity145 , director of @entity146 , an organisation which is inter-faith and anti-extremist , told the @entity148 in december that it was ' ridiculous ' to blame @entity11 for the closure of pubs			1
he said : ' the consumption and marketing of alcohol has also changed over time			0
what is also clear is that some pubs have been successful and others have not been able to generate customers and clients			0
' a former health minister has appeared to suggest that keeping pubs open helps alleviate pressure on the @entity162			2
@entity60 @entity163 told peers at question time : ' there is great merit in keeping the pubs open			2
' she said : ' @entity171 men who are lonely and depressed are very often welcomed into pubs			0
' to laughter , @entity173 added : ' their spirits are raised in all senses and they are not a burden on the @entity162			0
' responding for the government , @entity178 appeared at first to be taken aback by the comments , saying : ' gosh , i 'm not quite sure			0
' @entity182 quickly added : ' we 're actively working with @entity184 on the practicalities of how health - related objectives for licensing of premises selling alcohol would work at a local level			0
' the exchange came as peers challenged the strengths of alcoholic drinks being sold in supermarkets .			0

@entity1 minister @entity0 said @entity17 migrants did n't use pubs
he said ' lots of pubs have closed usually because of demographic change '
comes after @entity60 peer said pubs closing in areas like @entity71 and @entity69
lord @entity58 claimed growing @entity11 populations *threatening* pub trade
