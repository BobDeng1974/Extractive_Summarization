@entity0 welcomed an investigative report into the murky past of cycling 's governing body and said he hopes it can help the sport move on from an era that will always be remembered for the doping by himself and others			1
the report turned up no evidence to sustain previous allegations that @entity0 paid the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) to cover up a positive doping test back in his heyday , yet it explains in great detail how the @entity14 acted favorably toward @entity0 - a rider dubbed ' cycling 's pop star			1
' the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) was requested by @entity21 , the current @entity14 president			2
its report examined how the doping culture during @entity0 's era was allowed to fester under the previous @entity14 leadership of former president @entity26 and predecessor @entity27			1
a new report published on monday has found cycling leaders let doping flourish and broke their own rules so @entity0 could cheat his way to become a superstar the sport badly needed ' i am grateful to @entity20 for seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search			1
i am deeply sorry for many things i have done , ' @entity0 said in a statement			0
' it is my hope that revealing the truth will lead to a bright , dope - free future for the sport i love , and will allow all young riders emerging from small towns throughout the world in years to come to chase their dreams without having to face the lose - lose choices that so many of my friends , teammates and opponents faced			0

he was stripped of his seven tour titles for doping on every one of his wins from 1999 - 2005			1
@entity0 's attorney , @entity61 , said @entity0 ' cooperated fully ' with senior investigators over two days , answering all questions ' without any restrictions ' and providing ' all documents requested to which he had access			0
' in their affidavits provided to @entity58 - whose scathing report in 2012 exposed systematic doping by @entity0 and others - former @entity69 @entity68 teammates @entity70 and @entity71 declared that @entity0 had told them separately that he tested positive for the performance enhancer @entity77 at the 2001 @entity78			1
@entity71 claimed that the test was hushed up as a result of a financial agreement with @entity27			0
@entity0 was tested five times during the 2001 @entity78			0
three samples were tested for @entity77 and they came back negative , although there was a ' strong suspicion ' that two of the ' a '' samples did contain traces of the banned blood booster , the @entity20 report said — adding that it deemed inappropriate the fact that ' @entity0 and his entourage were informed by the @entity14 of these suspect test results			1
' a year later , @entity0 sent @entity27 a letter containing a check for $ 25,000 as a donation toward the fight against doping			0
although @entity20 has ' not found any indication of a financial agreement ' the report said the ' @entity14 did not act prudently in accepting a donation from an athlete ' already under suspicion			2

the report explains in great detail how the international cycling union acted favorably toward @entity0 - a rider dubbed ' cycling 's pop star ' the collusion between @entity0 and the @entity14 's leadership features strongly in the 227 - page report			1
@entity0 's lawyers were allowed to draft parts of a supposedly independent report , which sought to debunk @entity110 daily @entity124 's claims in 2005 that @entity0 's samples at the @entity126 later tested positive for @entity77			2
the independent report into the ' 99 allegations , which was led by @entity130 lawyer @entity129 , was heavily criticized because it ' specifically excluded an examination of the @entity77 test , ' meaning it deliberately avoided addressing whether @entity0 used the substance			2
the @entity129 report coincided with an agreement between @entity0 and the @entity14 that he would donate $ 100,000 for the purchase of a @entity139 blood testing machine			2
this prompted allegations that his latest donation to the @entity14 's anti-doping cause was an indirect payment to help fund the @entity129 report and quash @entity124 's story			2
the @entity20 did not find ' any evidence to corroborate ' such allegations but said the @entity14 acted improperly ' in soliciting and accepting donations from an athlete ' under increasing suspicion			1
the close - knit relationship helped @entity0 on the ' 99 tour when he tested positive for a banned corticosteroid			2
@entity0 did not declare pre-race that he was using medication — even though the argument he used for using a corticoid cream was to treat saddle sores			0
rather than start disciplinary proceedings , the @entity14 accepted a backdated prescription and cleared him			0
@entity0 , having retired after the @entity160 , was also cleared by the @entity14 to make his comeback at @entity162 's @entity163 in 2009 — despite not being eligible because he had not been in the @entity14 's doping testing pool for a six - month period beforehand			1
@entity26 first wrote to @entity0 , firmly telling him he could not race			0
but two days after that , @entity26 informed him that he could compete			0
the same day , @entity0 told @entity26 that he would race in the @entity166 of @entity167 , which @entity26 was keen to promote in his homeland			0
in one email sent to @entity26 , written at the time of @entity58 's impending investigation , a @entity14 consultant refers to @entity0 as ' cycling 's pop star ' and states clearly that for the sake of its image the ' @entity14 has an interest that @entity179 is acquitted			1
