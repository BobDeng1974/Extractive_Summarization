published : 21:40 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 14 november 2013 it has been revealed that @entity1 was headed to her first ever sleepover the moments when news broke of a shooting near the president during a trip to @entity8			2
one of @entity11 's former @entity10 agents has written a new book about the first family 's heartbreak following the assassination of president @entity11 , now giving a first person account of the tragic ordeal			1
@entity18 , who has written five days in november , was assigned to protect the @entity19 and was following the open - top convertible as the president was shot			1
moments before : president @entity11 and @entity21 were in the back of a convertible on november 22 , 1963 when he was killed by an assassin 's bullet brave face : mrs @entity1 told her children @entity1 and @entity28 what had happened to their father once she arrived back in @entity31 ( seen on the day of the funeral three days later ) staying together : at the time of the shooting , @entity1 was on her way to her first sleepover when the first shots were reported over the radio but her friends ' mother who was driving the car said she probably did n't hear iconic : on the day of his third birthday , @entity28 saluted his father 's casket instead , it was agent @entity46 who was in charge of protecting the children , 5 - year - old @entity1 and 2 - year - old @entity28 neither traveled with their parents on that fateful trip to @entity8			1
@entity28 was too young to know what was going on , but the agent feared that @entity1 might			0
she was headed to her friend @entity55 when the first reports of the shooting were broadcast over the radio			0
mr @entity46 signaled for mrs @entity55 to stop the car , and though she told him that the girls were playing and probably did not hear the report , he decided that he had to get @entity1 back to the @entity62			2
heartbreaking : when the president left for trip to @entity66 more than a month before his fateful @entity68 trip , it was very clear that his young son did not want him to leave working together : one of the final photos of @entity71 and his son was captured in a tender moment on october 15 when the toddler played under the @entity76 @entity77 : @entity1 is seen sitting on her father 's lap and @entity28 on @entity21 's while they watched drills and dances from the @entity62 portico on november 13 close care : while his mother @entity21 was panicking in a @entity8 hospital , @entity28 was in the care of his nanny @entity88 ( seen together in may of 1963 ) constant presence : mrs @entity88 , seen in the car with then - president - elect @entity71 and @entity21 headed home from the hospital with baby @entity28 in her arms with nanny @entity94 with them ' @entity1 , there has been a change in plans , and you mother has asked that you come back , ' mr @entity46 told the little girl			1
mr @entity18 's book , a preview excerpt of which was published in @entity105 , reports that @entity28 was with his nanny , @entity106			2
once mrs @entity1 arrived back in @entity31 later on the evening of november 22 , she and mrs @entity88 were the ones to tell the children that their father had died			1
' she was very strong through the whole ordeal , ' mr @entity46 said in the book			0
that was far from her only act of strength during that difficult time , as mr @entity18 said that he was concerned for her own safety as she tested the limits while trying to catch a piece of her husband 's skull that had been shot off and flew out the back of the open - top convertible			1
horrific : agent @entity123 was the one who ran up to the back of the convertible to protect @entity125 as she tried climbing out of the back of the car to get a piece of her husband 's head that had been shot off special event : though she was in mourning just over a week after he husband 's assassination , mrs @entity1 made a point to attend the award ceremony honoring @entity18 ( seen at her left ) he recalled the moment when he had to run and climb into the car from the back before it sped away : ' mrs @entity1 , her eyes filled with terror , is crawling out of her seat and onto the trunk , oh @entity147 ... the car is beginning to speed up and if i do n't get to her , she 's going to be thrown off			1
i push her back into the seat			0
' one year later : the @entity11 family had moved to a townhouse in the neighborhood of @entity154 by the time they visited his grave on his birthday on may 29 , 1964 mrs @entity1 spearheaded the logistics of planning a state funeral as soon as she arrived back in the @entity161 , after standing by her husband 's vice president 's side when he was sworn in to take over on board @entity165			1
the next three days were a blur of seemingly - unending memorial engagements			0
after the formal funeral ceremony , there was a much more light - hearted event that she had to plan , which agent @entity18 asked her about as soon as she got back to the @entity62			2
' " oh and mrs @entity1 ? i hate to bring it up			2
have you thought about doing anything for @entity28 's birthday ? " her mouth breaks into the slightest of smiles			0
" oh mr hill , you never forget anything , do you ? in fact that 's what we 're going to do now , have a little celebration , " ' he wrote of their exchange			0
relatives and close friends had gathered in the private residence on the second floor of the @entity62 and sang @entity193 songs and said funny poems in celebration of the slain president 's son 's third birthday			0
' there are presents and cake and the laughter of children is the sliver of sunshine amid the blackness of the past four days , ' mr @entity18 wrote .			0
