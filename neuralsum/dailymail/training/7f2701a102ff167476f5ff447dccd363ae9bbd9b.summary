the peer said he could n't get excited by the current leaders or the visions they have the peer who bankrolled @entity6 through the @entity7 and @entity8 years has condemned @entity9 as an ‘ average ’ politician with an uninspiring political vision			1
lord @entity12 , who has given more than £ 12 million to the @entity6 , says that he has no intention of donating to the party again			1
the multimillionaire businessman and philanthropist said of the labour leader : ‘ in terms of political skills , i think he ’s average			1
average in the sense that i think @entity24 and @entity25 are pretty average			1
‘ none of the three leaders was in the “ top bracket ” , and did not compare with @entity7 or @entity31 , ’ he told the @entity27			1
but the peer , part of the @entity12 ’s supermarket dynasty , denied that he had stopped funding @entity6 because @entity35 - who he had backed in the @entity6 leadership race in 2010 - was defeated by his brother			1
the comments come before the release of lord @entity12 ’s new book , in which he makes the assertion that the economic policies of the @entity7 and @entity8 governments , in which he played a role , were flawed			1
in his book , @entity47 , he writes : ‘ i believed the policies we [ @entity6 ] had developed in opposition would increase the prosperity of the country and create a fairer society			2
‘ but in government , i gradually came to realise that our thinking largely reflected the dominant neoliberal political economy of the time , which was not a useful basis for developing policies to achieve our goals			0
’ he continues : ‘ in retrospect the @entity6 government should have used the opportunity of a strongly growing economy to reduce the deficit			2
’ the peer denied that he had stopped funding @entity6 because @entity35 - who he had backed in the @entity6 leadership race in 2010 - was defeated by his brother @entity67 ( left ) the peer said he could n’t get excited by the current leaders or the visions they have and that he could not suggest an alternative leader to @entity9 , because he ‘ would n’t want to blight their careers by singling them out ’			1
he said he has become less political following beginning his work with the @entity75 , the charity he set up to improve @entity77 effectiveness , and as chancellor of the @entity79 , a role he assumed in 2011			0
‘ it ’s much easier to do them if you ’re not heavily involved in politics , ’ he said			0
however , he insisted his has not become ‘ apolitical ’ and is still a member of the @entity6			2
he continues to talk to them on ‘ issues on policy and progressive capitalism			0
but i put that in a very different category from major contributions to the party , ’ he said			0
and lord @entity12 denied that he withdrew funding from the @entity6 because @entity9 won the 2010 leadership contest			1
although he made his last direct donation to @entity6 in april 2010 , the peer has continued to fund @entity98 , a @entity100 think - tank , and @entity101 , which trains @entity6 activists in the @entity104			2
he has donated £ 1.3 million since may 2010 , according to @entity106 records			0
last summer , the @entity108 union called on @entity9 to outlaw @entity98			0
‘ they made these various speeches but no one paid any attention to it , as far as i know , ’ lord @entity12 said			1
‘ i guess it ’s to do with the idea that @entity98 is a @entity100 organisation which the trade unions should oppose			0
’ @entity117 party chairman @entity116 said : ' this is further proof that a weak @entity9 is allowing @entity6 to be taken over and run by unions in their interest , rather than in the interests of the hardworking @entity104 people			2
' it 's no surprise that @entity9 's totally opposed to dealing with the deficit , fixing welfare or getting immigration under control when 81 per cent of his funding comes from union bosses			0
' all @entity9 offers is the same old @entity6 solution that got us into this mess in the first place - more spending , more borrowing and more debt			0

lord @entity12 says @entity6 leader 's political skills are ' average '
says @entity25 and @entity24 do not compare with @entity7 or @entity31
*announces* he has no intention of donating to party again
