@entity0 have provided the biggest indication yet that @entity2 will remain at the club this summer after managing director @entity4 provided compelling assurances to the club 's major sponsors , @entity6			1
@entity8 understands that @entity4 delivered an address on monday morning in front of a watching audience - including @entity12 , the group chief executive of @entity6 - at the bank 's @entity14 headquarters , where the @entity0 chief was joined by @entity18 legend @entity17			2
@entity6 have been the club 's main shirt sponsor since 2010 and their current deal is estimated to be worth in the region of Â£ 20million a year and will run until the end of the 2015/16 campaign			2
going nowhere : @entity2 will not be sold in the summer , according to @entity4 such financial commitment brings grand expectations and @entity8 understands that the sponsors were impressed to hear a rousing talk from @entity4 , who maintained that @entity0 are confident that @entity2 will remain at the club and he also revealed that the club are hopeful that their identified summer transfer targets will be signed as @entity33 ' side seek to impress in @entity35 competition next season			1
although @entity4 admitted that @entity0 's remarkable success in the @entity39 this season could see the vultures circle around @entity2 in the summer transfer window , with @entity43 and @entity44 understood to be monitoring the @entity45 , the managing director insisted that the club is not in the business of selling its star assets			1
in a significant demonstration of the club 's ambition in front of leading @entity6 officials , @entity4 is also understood to have cited a strong working relationship with both @entity2 and his agent , praising the striker as quiet , family man whose off - field conduct has impressed many within the walls of @entity18 in recent times			1
marksman : @entity2 is the @entity39 's top goalscorer with 29 after an impressive season for @entity0 consistent : @entity0 have repeatedly knocked back any transfer interest in @entity2 since he arrived @entity0 , who currently sit top of the @entity39 with five games remaining , believe that the motivation behind the @entity45 forward 's discontent last summer was solely based upon his wish to compete on the biggest stage , rather than any desire to squeeze more cash out of his employers or to earn more money elsewhere			0
however , as @entity0 have now guaranteed that they will dine at @entity80 's top table with @entity83 football next season , the club are convinced that he will remain at @entity18 and that he will remain true to the new four - and - a - half year contract that he signed in december			2
to ensure that @entity0 build upon their most encouraging campaign for many years , it is understood that background checks have already been made on the mentality and attitude of the key targets that the @entity33 would like to bring in to @entity18 this summer and @entity8 understands that preliminary contact has been made with several clubs in anticipation of the summer transfer window			0
the emphasis is on players that will enrich and blend into the current squad , rather than disrupt the current set - up			0
on the road to glory : @entity33 has his eyes on the @entity39 title ready to build : @entity0 director @entity4 says @entity2 is not for sale although @entity4 did not make direct reference to @entity33 ' contract situation , @entity8 believes that he indicated to the sponsors that long - term deals are in the pipeline for key members of the club 's staff at the end of this season , stressing that @entity0 are determined to commit to this new era under their @entity119 manager			1
@entity33 ' current contract is set to expire in the summer of 2015 but there is an appetite from both the manager and the board to extend that deal when the time is right - most probably in the close season			0
meanwhile , @entity0 are also moving gradually closer to securing a long - awaited expansion of the club 's @entity18 stadium			1
the club need to acquire one last block of flats to secure the expansion but they are increasingly confident that any remaining issues will soon be resolved and that planning permission will be granted in the near future , as @entity0 aim to bring their all - seater capacity up to 60,000			0
the possibility of moving from the club 's iconic home is now a none - starter , with @entity0 's owner @entity143 underlining his feelings to the board that nothing can replicate the unique ' feeling ' inside @entity18 .			0
