by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 04:15 est , 1 april 2013 as reforms to legal aid come into force today , people who represent themselves in court have been told not to behave like tv 's fast - talking lawyer @entity6 as reforms to legal aid come into force today , people who represent themselves in court have been told not to behave like tv 's fast - talking lawyer @entity6			1
the advice forms part of a layman 's guide to courtroom etiquette , issued by the @entity17 - and includes handy tips such as : ' you might be tempted to speak like lawyers on tv			1
' lawyers do not really speak like that			0
some bad lawyers do , but judges hate it			0
' it comes as legal aid will no longer be available for whole classes of compensation claims , including those made over medical negligence , personal injury and employment law			1
taxpayer support will also be withdrawn from many family law , education , immigration , debt , housing and benefit disputes			2
other advice offered in the booklet , a guide to representing yourself in @entity45 , states : ' make sure you speak loudly , slowly and clearly , ' according to the @entity49			2
the manual , which will be distributed to all mps in @entity52 and @entity53 , also suggests you dress smartly and turn up early			0
the 74 - page ' idiot 's guide ' , put together by top barristers , adds : ' make sure you know what you 're supposed to be calling the judge and whether you are supposed to stand up every time you speak ( ask the usher beforehand if you are unsure )			2
' if you can not find the usher , just say " sir " or " madam "			0
' another vital pointer says : ' always be completely honest with the judge and with any officials			0
' there can be very serious consequences if you deliberately lie or even bend the truth			0
' the reforms to the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) come into immediate effect as the government moves to reduce its £ 2.2billion legal aid bill by £ 350million			1
private family law , such as divorce and custody battles , personal injury cases , some employment and education law , immigration cases where the person is not detained and some debt , housing and benefit issues will all be impacted			1
the @entity17 's guide comes as legal aid will no longer be available for whole classes of compensation claims , including those made over medical negligence , personal injury and employment law			1
( above , tv show @entity96 ) some law firms estimate the reforms will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent , meaning around 200,000 fewer cases , while barristers have warned the cuts are the biggest to civil legal aid since the system was introduced in 1949			1
and to assist those representing themselves in a civil action , the guide also offers help on how to put together your own case , deal with specific areas of law and defend a claim			2
@entity118 , which represents solicitors in @entity52 and @entity53 , warned that ' people could start taking the law into their own hands as a result of an inability to seek justice following the government 's civil legal aid cuts '			1
@entity128 , head of legal aid at the @entity118 , said : ' we have warned @entity127 consistently that , as well as all the knock - on costs , the social consequences will be damaging to the whole of society , not just the vulnerable who will take the worst hit of all			1
' the @entity17 , which represents barristers in @entity52 and @entity53 , said ' vulnerable people will suffer ' as a result of the changes			2
@entity142 , chair of the @entity17 , said : ' as a result of @entity73 , more people than ever before will find themselves going to court without legal representation			2
' it is not just the view of the @entity148 , the broader legal profession and legal advice centres are all saying the same thing			2
' we are faced with a situation whereby access to justice is no longer being adequately funded and vulnerable people will suffer			2
' cases that will continue to receive funding include family law cases involving domestic violence , forced marriage or child abduction issues , mental health cases , asylum and debt and housing matters where someone 's home is at immediate risk			0
the changes have prompted a raft of warnings from law firms across the country			0
the removal of legal aid for divorce cases will hit the @entity178 's poorest households almost three times harder than people in the richest parts of the country , according to research by family law firm stephensons			1
the average cost of a divorce is £ 1,300 or 9 per cent of the average yearly income in @entity187 in @entity188 , the @entity178 constituency with the lowest average salary , @entity185 said			0
by contrast , £ 1,300 is equal to just 3.3 per cent of the average annual income in @entity195 , which has the @entity178 's highest average salary			0
elsewhere , @entity197 warned low - income parents may be left unable to afford necessary legal representation to secure contact rights with their children following divorce			0
and @entity203 argued that the number of individuals taking divorce and children cases to court as ' self representing litigants ' as a result of the withdrawal of aid could burden the courts with more ' long - running and poorly organised cases '			0
a @entity215 spokeswoman said : ' we need to make sure taxpayers ' money is not spent resolving too many disputes in court , when there are quicker , cheaper and less stressful options available			0
' at £ 2 billion a year we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world , and it 's now costing taxpayers too much at time when resources are not limitless			1
' we had to make some difficult decisions , and it was not a process we embarked on lightly , but we have safeguarded legal aid to ensure lawyers are there for those who really need them			1
' ' taking the law into their own hands ' last month , a senior judge was accused of meddling in politics after saying that legal aid cuts would bring lawlessness			1
@entity245 , the head of the country ’s highest court , warned that stripping half a million @entity178 of the right to free lawyers would ‘ lead to people taking the law into their own hands ’			0
he added that cuts to free legal advice and free courtroom lawyers would ‘ start to undermine the rule of law ’			2
criticising the judge ’s remarks , @entity256 , @entity257 mp for @entity258 , said : ‘ if the system of justice over which his lordship presides was not so inaccessible to my constituents , justice would be even - handed in the first place			0
‘ but the self - serving legal elite has made justice so expensive that the state has had to subsidise lawyers			0
@entity245 should concentrate on providing cheaper justice and stop bellyaching			0
’ criminologist dr @entity273 , of the @entity275 think - tank , said : ‘ it is inappropriate for the president of the @entity45 to make such political comments			0
' the judge ’s remarks were a shot across the bows of justice secretary @entity282 , who recently announced more legal aid reforms			1
these will try to reduce the price of taxpayer - funded defence lawyers in criminal cases by making law firms submit competitive tenders for criminal legal aid work , so that solicitors and barristers would be forced to compete on price for work			1
@entity257 and @entity296 governments and now the @entity297 have all tried to reform legal aid since the 1980s , during which time taxpayer spending on lawyers ’ bills has more than quadrupled to £ 2.1billion a year			1
official figures show that in the financial year to march 2011 , six barristers each made more than £ 500,000 from criminal legal aid cases			1
another was paid more than £ 450,000 for civil legal aid cases .			1

legal aid will no longer be available for compensation claims regarding medical negligence , personal injury and employment law
