by @entity0 last updated at 7:31 am on 16th december 2011 @entity1 are fighting a losing battle against the bulge with more than a quarter of men and women classed as clinically obese for the first time			1
today 's report from the @entity8 revealed that 26 per cent of men and women were obese in 2010			1
this has increased from 13 per cent of men and 16 per cent of women in 1993			2
the number of overweight and obese men and women and obese - only men and women has gradually increased since 1993 only one in three men are now a ' normal weight ' with 68 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women classed as overweight or obese			1
this was calculated by combining each person 's body mass index with their waist circumference			0
overall , 16 per cent of men and 17 per cent of women have also been diagnosed with asthma			2
obesity can cause a number of health problems including type 2 diabetes and heart disease the bleak figures follow a report from the @entity33 that found one one child in three is overweight when they leave primary school at the age of 11			0
almost a fifth are classed as obese , meaning they are so fat they risk knocking years off their lives			0
and the number of ten and 11 - year - olds who fall into this category has risen by nearly 10 per cent in just four years , according to @entity8 data			0
the only improvement was seen among reception children , with the number of obese four and five years old dropping from 9.8 per cent in 2009 to 9.4 per cent in 2010			0
@entity50 , chairman of the @entity51 , told @entity52 : ' any encouragement having read yesterday 's toddler obesity improvement has gone out of the window ! ' to - day 's figures simply confirm the worst and illustrate how laughable government attempts have been to keep @entity1 from being the fattest nation in @entity59			2
men aged 55 to 64 were the most likely to be overweight or obese ( 82 % ) ' the comparison with 1993 is very apt : one has to remember that the government at the time targeted to reduce @entity1 adult obesity to " seven per cent or less " by the turn of the century ! ' each successive minister for health has been more incompetent than the previous appointee and more or less ensured that we have the disasterous figures we have today			1

just over *80* per cent of men aged between 55 and *74* were classed overweight or obese
each successive minister for health has been more incompetent , says chairman of @entity51
