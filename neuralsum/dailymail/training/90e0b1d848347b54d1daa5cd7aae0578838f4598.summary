by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 14:51 est , 28 may 2013 many football fans will often adorn their home with pictures of their beloved team			0
but @entity7 fans @entity5 and @entity8 decided to go that little bit further than most			1
the dedicated @entity11 supporters turned their bathroom wall into a shrine to their heroes by building this amazing 2,000 tile mosaic of the club ’s crest			1
fans : @entity5 and @entity8 created this 5ft mosaic of the @entity7 in their bathroom - with the project even leading to the couple 's engagement dedicated : the @entity7 supporters built the amazing 2,000 tile mosaic of the club 's crest over six months and after spending six months working together on the mosaic - mr @entity5 decided it would be the perfect backdrop for him to ask his girlfriend for her hand in marriage			1
to complete the 5ft dazzling design , mr @entity5 , 37 , and @entity33 , 30 , patiently stuck each individual tile chip to the wall			1
@entity33 , who works as a legal secretary , said : ' we moved into the house a couple of years ago and were doing it up			1
' some tiling was done in the bathroom but there was one wall remaining which looked a bit bare , so i suggested making a colourful mosaic city crest out of the remaining tiles			1
' i was a bit of a whacky idea , but everyone understands our love for the team			0
we ’re season ticket holders and never miss a game , so i do n’t think anyone would expect anything less			0
' lifelong supporter mr @entity5 , who previously installed three stars on his garden footpath in celebration of last year ’s @entity60 title win , thought it was a cracking idea and sketched out a design			1
project : to complete the 5ft dazzling design , mr @entity5 , 37 , and @entity33 , 30 , patiently stuck each individual tile chip to the wall			1
these pictures show the mural 's progress mr @entity5 , who lives in @entity70 , @entity71 , with @entity33 and her four - year - old son @entity72 , said : ' i have always loved drawing and loved the idea of completing a project together			1
' we spent about six months in there , determined to get a little bit more done when we could			2
we used hammers to smash the tiles into minute pieces and even had to round some of them off with a file , to create curved edges			2
he said : ' we then had to paint each piece separately and it was very tough at times , making sure everything was symmetrical			0
' we spent about 30 minutes on it each night and we encouraged each other to keep going			0
' and mr @entity5 , who was hoping to pop the question at the @entity95 ground in front of thousands of fans , decided to propose to his girlfriend in the bathroom			1
colourful : the couple are both season ticket holders and never miss a game of their beloved team			0
these images show the mural 's progression late into the project he said : ' i was going to as @entity8 to marry me by putting it up on the big advertising screens at the football , but a guy who sits behind us at every game bet me to it			1
' i figured , since we were spending so much time in the bathroom working on the mosaic , i thought it would be quite special and memorable			2
' and the proposal was totally unexpected for @entity125 , who had just finished working on the piece that night			0
she said : ' it was like we were living in the bathroom and after spending a bit of time on the mosaic , i decided to run myself a lovely bath			1
i was lying back , relaxing			0
i closed my eyes for a second and when i opened them , @entity5 was kneeling next to the bath			2
' it was amazing and such a surprise			0
the mosaic will always remind me of us getting engagement			0
she said : ' i ’ve been there with him on so many nights chipping away at mosaic tiles			2
' we ’re both so passionate about the club and i think the mosaic is beautiful - it really has the wow factor			2
thrilled : although the happy couple are yet to set a date for their wedding , they hope to marry at @entity7 's @entity157 ' when our friends visit , they think we ’re pretty mad , but we ’re really mad about @entity7			1
everyone has been impressed with it , especially when you see the full size of it , ' she laughed			0
and the couple are planning to also have their favourite club featuring at their wedding and although they are yet to set a date for the big day , they hope to bag the @entity170 as the venue			2
miss @entity125 said : ' most brides would cringe at the thought of inviting their guests to a wedding on a football ground - not me			0
' it would be a dream come true and we ’ve already checked the venue out - we ’d have the function in one of the suites			0
' we ’ll also have the team ’s colours , i can just imagine everybody in light blue and white , it would just look stunning			0

they spent six months individually attaching tiles to the bathroom wall
mr @entity5 decided it was perfect backdrop to propose to @entity33
