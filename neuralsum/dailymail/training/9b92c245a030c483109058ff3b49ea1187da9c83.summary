by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:08 am on 19th september 2011 a sacred tree which came back to life after it was nearly destroyed by vandals must now be replaced - thanks to trophy hunters who have broken off its new shoots			1
the @entity9 in @entity10 - which can trace its roots back 2,000 years to the death of @entity13 - had its branches hacked off in december last year			1
it miraculously started to grow new shoots earlier this year and made a fragile recovery over the summer			1
hacked off : the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity10			1
the sacred tree 's fragile recovery from an attack by vandals has been put at risk by trophy hunters but some of the new growth has now been removed and locals suspect trophy hunters will use them to try and grow their own holy tree			1
the tree was also damaged by ribbons tied around the trunk and coins and other items that have been shoved into the bark			1
well - wishers have even poured honey , @entity37 and cider around the roots , causing further damage			1
local councillor @entity41 , a former mayor of @entity10 , said it will be replaced with a new one grafted from the original branches which were hacked off			1
' people do n't realise the damage they are doing			2
i am forever removing these ribbons because they block sunlight to the trunk , ' he said			2
' we 've had people pulling things off - the new growth and bark on the trunk			2
we think it would have survived if it was just left alone			2
' there is still life in the trunk but we doubt that it will ever recover			0
it is very sad but we think the best thing is to replace it			0

he visited @entity10 and thrust his staff into @entity88 , just below the @entity89 , planting a seed for the original thorn tree			0
barren : botanists from @entity93 hope to plant another tree carefully grafted from the old one nearby @entity96 's @entity95 felled the tree during the @entity98 , when @entity99 waged a vicious battle against the @entity101			0
