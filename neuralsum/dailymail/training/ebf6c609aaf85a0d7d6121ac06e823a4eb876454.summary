@entity0 is about to be hit by eastward - moving waves of warm water , resurrecting hopes that @entity4 may be on its way			1
@entity4 - a heating of sea - surface temperatures in the @entity8 - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the globe			1
the most recent waves increase the chances that parched @entity16 could be in for some relief - albeit small - if weather patterns take a turn later this year			1
the waves of warm water are pictured but @entity29 has warned that ' fickle ' @entity4 will likely be weak if it does appear , providing only limited relief for a drought - ridden west coast			1
around 430,000 acres of land will be left fallow in @entity16 - because there has n't been enough rain or snow coming from the nearby mountain ranges			0
prospects had been fading for an @entity4 event this year , but now there 's a glimmer of hope for a modest comeback			1
@entity29 recently spotted areas of higher sea level indicating warmer than normal water in the @entity8			1
now crossing the central and eastern equatorial @entity8 , these warm waves , known as @entity48 , appear as the large area of warmer - than - normal ocean temperatures hugging the equator			1
kelvin waves of high sea level ( red / yellow ) are seen crossing the @entity8 at the equator			1
the waves may be due to @entity4 events			2
@entity58 indicates normal sea level , and blue / purple areas are lower than normal the @entity62 waves are travelling eastward and should arrive off the coast of @entity0 in late september and early october			1
@entity4 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity26 in the central and eastern @entity8 becomes hotter than usual			1
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity72 ( approximately 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			2
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity8 and globally			2
strong @entity4 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			0
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity87 is the climatological counterpart to @entity4			0
@entity87 refers to periods when sea - surface temperatures around the @entity26 are cooler than normal			1
this has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere			0
climatologist @entity99 of @entity29 's @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity16 , warned it 's too early to know for sure , but he would not be surprised if the latest kelvin waves are the ' last hurrah ' for @entity4			1
' since february 2014 , the prospect of an @entity4 has waxed and waned , ' he said			0
' this late in the season , the best we can expect is a weak to moderate event			0
what comes next is not yet clear			0
' but for the drought - plagued @entity111 , the possibility of a badly needed drenching is fading , ' continued @entity99			0
if it appears , this year 's @entity4 is expected to be mild			2
however , scientists expect extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong @entity114 will double this century			0
the worst @entity4 on record , in 1997 and 1998 , was blamed for massive flooding along @entity118 's @entity117 , responsible for killing more than 1,500 people			0
the impact of extreme @entity4 events is felt by every continent , and the event in 1997 cost up to £ 27.4 billion ( $ 45 billion ) in damage globally			2
extreme @entity4 events develop differently from standard @entity125 , which first appear in the @entity8			1
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity8			2
around 430,000 acres of land will be left fallow in @entity16 - because there has n't been enough rain or snow coming from the nearby mountain ranges			0
pictured is a mud flow along @entity135 in the @entity136 which may be related to @entity16 's prolonged drought the sea temperature as seen from space on september 18			0
@entity58 shows normal sea level , and blue and purple areas are lower than normal			0
strong @entity4 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			0

@entity0 is about to be hit by eastward - moving waves of warm water
this suggests a very modest @entity4 event may appear later this year
@entity4 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity26 in the @entity8 becomes hotter than usual
it can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the globe
@entity29 has warned that @entity4 will likely be weak if it does appear
this means it will only provide a limited amount of relief to the west coast
