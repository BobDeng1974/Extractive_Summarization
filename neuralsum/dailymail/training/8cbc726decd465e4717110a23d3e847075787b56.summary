she regularly posted messages such as ‘ i will never be beautiful and skinny ’			0
@entity81 said there were a number of issues rather than one ‘ specific trigger ’ that may have led to her death			0
he said : ‘ it could be a combination of what appears to be relationship breakdowns with people on the internet , concern about self - appearance and basically engaging with like - minded people who seem to feed that obsession			0
it appeared from the diary that @entity61 sadly had very low self - esteem			2
’ @entity100 , senior coroner for inner @entity40 north , told the jury a photograph of @entity104 showed her to be a ‘ very beautiful , lovely looking young woman ’			0

‘ because @entity61 was naturally very gifted at dance she also had a brilliant sense of humour and in many ways she was the most able member of the group			1
’ he said she did appear to lose some of her ‘ spark ’ later in the year but appeared to have improved again , producing some ‘ brilliant work ’ just a week before her death			0
