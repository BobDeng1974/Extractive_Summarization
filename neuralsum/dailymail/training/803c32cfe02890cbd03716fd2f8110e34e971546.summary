sir @entity1 had blocked the release of the names as @entity4 is considering investigating allegations that the firms used private investigators who broke the law to obtain sensitive information			1
however , last night sources dashed any hopes that his decision to step down over a conflict of interest could soften the crime - fighting agency ’s position on the list			2
one said : ‘ the very good reasons that it must not be made public remain exactly the same			0
’ angry mps on the @entity33 , who have been given the list , are desperately hunting for a way to legitimately publish it without undermining any potential prosecutions			1
they believe the firms on it have escaped scrutiny for hiring dodgy private investigators who hacked , blagged and stole private data			2
and they are suspicious of claims by @entity4 director general @entity45 that the list may still be used in ‘ live ’ cases as it was compiled before 2008			0

the list of 102 companies was handed to the select committee on the condition it is kept in a locked safe on secure premises			1
however , members have revealed the list is dominated by law firms , while others on it include debt collectors , oil companies , venture capitalists , pharmaceutical firms and two celebrities			1
yesterday , a jailed private investigator revealed that his biggest clients were insurers at @entity73			0
@entity74 , 73 , a former @entity75 detective , was one of four rogue snoopers whose customers form the basis of the secret list			0
he said that he was employed by three international law firms based in the @entity81 , which were in turn working for underwriters on the @entity73 ’s market , and that he would regularly be asked to carry out ‘ financial investigations ’ to assess the value of individuals and companies			2
mr @entity45 and others are due to answer further questions on the row next month when @entity32 return from their summer break			0
