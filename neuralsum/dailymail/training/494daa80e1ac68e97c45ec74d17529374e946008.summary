the number of people employed by the @entity2 has risen despite repeated promises to cut staffing levels			1
official figures have revealed that 22,039 people work at the corporation , an increase of 310 since last year			1
it has also emerged that headhunters were paid more than £ 650,000 in 2013 to fill posts across the organisation			2
@entity13 on his first day as director general of the @entity2 at @entity15 in central @entity16 yesterday critics branded the staffing rise ‘ astonishing ’ and the use of headhunters ‘ ludicrous ’			2
while the official employment figures – taken as a snapshot a month ago – include employees on permanent , fixed - term and flexible contracts , they do not include casual staff , so the true figure could be even higher			1
in october 2011 , then director - general @entity27 said 2,000 jobs would be cut by 2017 as part of a push to save £ 700million			1
however , the latest figures show the @entity2 is hiring people faster than it is cutting back			1
a spokesman for the corporation claimed yesterday it is still on track to make savings of £ 850million by 2017 and that the rise in staff can be partly attributed to one - off projects			1
he said : ‘ occasionally staff numbers will fluctuate depending on programme schedules and other special projects , such as the @entity44 , covering the @entity46 referendum , further development and personalisation of @entity49			2
’ @entity2 director - general @entity50 resigned over his failure to get to grips with the @entity53 ( left ) scandal and his predecessor in the @entity2 hot seat @entity27 ( right ) who promised to cut staff but the 2014 figure of 22,039 is higher than the 22,013 employed in 2012 when the @entity2 had the @entity59 and the @entity60 to cover			1
there was a fall to 21,729 in 2013 before the recent rise			0
@entity64 of the @entity65 ’ @entity66 said : ‘ at a time when all public sector organisations should be cutting back on staffing numbers , it ’s astonishing the @entity2 ’s has actually increased			0
‘ you ’d have thought the headcount would peak during a big event like the @entity59 so the continued growth is disappointing news for families feeling the pinch , hoping for cuts to the licence fee			0
’ the @entity2 has also been criticised over the amount it has spent on headhunters			0
figures obtained under the @entity82 show that in the calendar year 2013 the @entity2 spent £ 657,522 on ‘ recruitment consultants , executive search , and headhunting firms for the hiring of @entity2 staff at all grades , including senior staff and members of the executive board ’			1
in the financial year ending march 2013 it spent £ 700,813			2
it was during this period that £ 150,000 was paid to recruitment consultants to find a replacement for mr @entity27			1
but then the @entity2 made an internal promotion , giving @entity50 the £ 450,000 - a - year job			2
he lasted just two months before quitting after a series of scandals including the sir @entity101 revelations and @entity103 ’s wrongful implication of @entity104 in a child abuse case			0
@entity107 mp @entity106 , a member of the @entity109 culture committee , said it was ‘ completely ludicrous ’ for @entity2 to spend so much on headhunters			0
he added : ‘ most businesses seem to do perfectly well drawing up their own shortlists and do n’t have to resort to hiring expensive headhunters			0
‘ it ’s another example of the @entity2 having too much money , which is why we should have a reduced licence fee			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity2 said its main recruitment channel is its website			0
he added : ‘ we do however sometimes use external recruitment consultants to help ensure we obtain applications from a wide range of high - quality candidates , often for very specialised roles			0
