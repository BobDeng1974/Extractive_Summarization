@entity2 ’s @entity1 arm has been told it will have to pay a 1,000 euro fine every day should the parent company in @entity5 – @entity2 - fail to remove a defamatory article from its global network @entity2 complied with an order for links to the defamatory articles to be removed , but the @entity5 parent company did not , @entity24 reported			1
this means that the articles are not visible to internet users in @entity1 , but are to anyone based outside the country			2
mr @entity15 said that it was important for the parent company to remove the articles from its entire network because his firm has a global reputation			1
he said : ‘ @entity2 complied , but in spite of serving judgment on @entity2 nothing happened			2
they simply did n’t comply and did n’t even respond to the @entity1 court order			1
’ the latest judgement by the @entity44 was made possible , mr @entity15 explained , by a clause in the right to be forgotten ruling that links divisions in multinational companies			0
it says : ' the activities of the operator of the search engine and those of its establishment situated in the member state concerned are inextricably linked			0
' the order is a punitive one and opens the door for other @entity2 subsidiaries to be sued should the parent company ignore requests for defamatory articles to be wiped off the network			1
mr @entity15 added : ‘ now a daily penalty can be inflicted upon @entity2 by local courts until @entity2 delivers the result by way of [ removing links ] world wide			2
’ the case was brought against @entity2 by @entity15 , a @entity16 lawyer employed in @entity1 , last august following a malicious campaign against his firm by various blogs and sites that was overseen by someone who could n’t be traced a @entity2 spokesman told @entity24 : ‘ a @entity2 spokesperson said : “ this was initially a defamation case and it began before the @entity82 ruling on the right to be forgotten			1
we are reviewing the ruling and considering our options			0
’ this week @entity87 warned that terrorists are exploiting the right to be forgotten rule to wipe stories about their trials from @entity2 in a move that amounts to censorship by the back door			1
the @entity96 condemned ‘ @entity98 ’s unelected judges ’ who created the rule			0
in a forthright speech to newspaper editors , mr @entity87 accused @entity104 courts of ‘ trying to restrict media freedom ’ and took aim at the @entity107 for competing with news websites like @entity109			0
last month it emerged @entity2 has deleted more than 18,000 web links following requests from @entity113 from @entity114 included a former clergyman who wanted to remove links to articles about a sex abuse investigation and a doctor who botched a medical procedure			2
@entity2 said it deleted 35 per cent , or 18,459 , of the unwanted links @entity114 requested be removed			2
mr @entity87 said the scale of the attempts to remove links to news stories was a threat to journalism			0
‘ since @entity98 ’s unelected judges created the so - called “ right to be forgotten ” , @entity2 has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds , ’ he told the @entity132 conference in @entity133			0
‘ each day , a thousand requests pour in from people who , for one reason or another , would prefer their pasts to be kept secret			0
‘ criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other , similar crimes			0
‘ terrorists have ordered @entity2 to cover up stories about their trials			0

the order by a @entity9 court enforces the ' right to be forgotten ' rule
the case was brought by a law firm in @entity1 that was defamed *online*
the court ordered links to a defamatory article about the firm to be deleted
@entity2 *'s* @entity1 division complied , but the parent company did not
it meant that the article was *invisible* in @entity1 , but visible elsewhere
now the @entity1 arm will be punished if the parent company fails to comply
