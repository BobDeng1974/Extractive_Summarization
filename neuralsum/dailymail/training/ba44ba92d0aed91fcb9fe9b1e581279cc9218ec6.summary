' our mission is to expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda ' , the @entity8 said on the campaign 's @entity93 page			0

and it 's time for @entity47 to project power and strength , ' @entity196 said			2

' in @entity146 , the boots on the ground have to be @entity146			0
' at the recent @entity232 summit in @entity233 , the @entity47 and nine allies agreed to take on the militants because of the threat they pose to member countries			2
