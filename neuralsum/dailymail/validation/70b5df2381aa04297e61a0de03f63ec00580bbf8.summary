the @entity1 government has come under fire for allowing the slaughter of nearly 470,000 seals as part of the biggest marine animal hunt on the planet			1
@entity9 's annual ' commercial seal hunt ' , which mainly takes place during march and april , sees thousands of young seals clubbed to death for their furs			1
the annual quota for the seal hunt has gone up in recent years , despite the market for seal pelts collapsing following an near world - wide ban on the furs			1
the seals are mainly killed for their pelts , but hunters also sell their blubber , which is used to make ‘ seal oil ’ and sold as a health supplement , and the penises , which are a popular ingredient in aphrodisiacs in some @entity60 markets			1
in order to avoid damage to the pelts , a majority of the seals are killed with clubs or a ‘ hakapik ’ – a seal hunting tool which has a hammer head used to crush a seal 's skull , and a hook used to drag away the carcass			1
although hunters and the @entity1 government claims these methods are humane , animal rights advocates say an alarming number of the seals are skinned while alive and responsive to pain			1
the @entity80 claims that independent , international team of veterinarians observed the hunt and examined the corpses of skinned seals			2
they found evidence that up to 40 per cent of the dead seals had skull injuries that were not sufficient to have caused death			0
looking for seal : @entity92 from @entity93 aboard the @entity94 for the annual seal hunt death in numbers : the 2015 seal hunt quota to 400,000 harp seals , 60,000 grey seals and 8,200 hooded seals - a total of more than 468,000 animals ' humane ' : a majority of seals are killed with clubs or a ‘ hakapik ’ to the head in order to avoid damaging the pelt killing : the annual quota of seals has gone up since the @entity113 , despite the actual number of seals killed going down in the wake of several countries banning import of products from commercial seal hunting threats : animal rights activists are also criticising the high quotas on the base that global warming is threatening all seal species in @entity9 as the ice , where the seals breed , is melting seal hunters are not allowed to kill seal pups which have yet to molt their downy white coat , however , this usually happens when the pup is between just ten to 21 days			1
adult seals are harder to hunt , and mainly has to be shot rather than clubbed – a tough task when the animal is in the water which also risks destroying the pelt			0
as a result , an estimated 95 - 98 per cent of the seals killed during the commercial hunt are three weeks to three months old			1
the seal hunt quota set by the @entity1 government has rolled over from last season and the 400,000 harp seal allowance has remained steady since 2011 , up from in 2010 and 280,000 in 2009			1
however , despite the large hunting quotas , approximately 94,000 harp seals were killed during the commercial hunt in 2013			2
this was an increase from 71,000 in 2012 and just 38,000 in 2011			0
the recent number of seals killed is a significant drop in numbers from the mid-to - late noughties with 218,000 harp seals killed in 2008 , 355,000 in 2006 and a jaw - dropping 366,000 in 2004			1
the reason for the drop in number of animals killed is a near world - wide ban of sales of the seals ' fur , which has seen the global market collapse			1
the @entity167 , the @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity172 of @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 have all stopped their trade in some or all products of commercial seal hunts			0
‘ the quotas are going up every year , despite opposition and the market for seal pelts disappearing , ’ says @entity180 of the @entity181			1
‘ the recent @entity168 ban on import of seal products has led to a dramatic collapse in the market			2
‘ the government is keeping the quotas they have already set , but the actual hunters themselves can not be bothered to go out because they can not sell the pelts			2
‘ if the @entity168 ban had happened a decade ago perhaps the hunt would 've grinded to a halt by now			0

\ n © @entity206 / @entity205 no change : despite the hunting quotas for harp seals staying at 400,000 , just 94,000 harp seals were killed during the commercial hunt in 2013 blood on their hands : @entity92 pulls a harp seal onto his barge at the beginning of the annual seal hunting season the recent number of seals killed during the @entity1 cull is a significant drop in numbers from the mid- to late noughties with 218,000 harp seals killed in 2008 , 355,000 in 2006 and 366,000 in 2004 there are also further threats to the @entity1 seals , as climate change is causing their ice habitat to deteriorate at an alarming rate			1
in recent years , the @entity1 government has estimated a near 100 per cent mortality for pups born in key whelping areas when the sea ice melted too soon in the season , and the pups drowned			2
‘ and as global warming is thinning the ice , which is the seal ’s breeding area , the species is already under threat , ' mr @entity180 adds			0
' it ’s outrageous that the @entity1 government is putting quotas up on an endangered species			2
' however , seal hunters and @entity9 's @entity248 ( @entity249 ) says the hunt is sustainable and humane , and earns money for isolated fishing communities in @entity9			2
seal hunting methods have been studied and approved by the @entity254 on @entity255 who concluded ' the methods of hunting seals compare favorably to those used to hunt any other wild or domestic animal '			2
why : the seals are mainly killed for their pelts , but hunters also sell their blubber and the penises , which are a popular ingredient in aphrodisiacs in @entity60 blow : despite hunters claiming it is a humane killing method , animal rights activists claim many seals are skinned while alive and responsive to pain red seas : pelts from harp seals lie in pools of blood after a long day of seal hunting in @entity9 in a statement to @entity280 , a @entity249 spokesperson defended the high quotas saying ' decisions are informed by science			1
' ' the overall @entity9 seal population , including harp seals , grey seals and hooded seals is healthy and abundant			0
harp seals are currently estimated at approximately 7.4 million animals which is more than three times what it was in the 1970s			0
' it is truly unfortunate that decades of misinformation campaigns by animal rights groups have had such a negative effect on the economic well - being of rural and @entity297 @entity1			0
' the effects of these campaigns are not just being felt economically , but ecologically as well			0
for example , the @entity9 grey seal population eats more than 1 million tonnes of fish each year			0
this is having a drastic effect on many fish species , most notably cod. ' @entity307 has been rock solid in its support for @entity1 sealers			0
we will continue to stand up for trade fairness for this important , traditional way of life			0
' @entity315 , executive director of @entity316 , condemns the quota as irresponsible			0
' @entity9 's fisheries minister has yet again ignored sound science in favour of her political agenda , ' ms @entity315 said in a statement			0
' the @entity1 government acknowledges that climate change is causing mass mortalities for these ice - dependent seals , yet is still endorsing the largest mass slaughter of marine mammals on the planet			1
' instead of setting irresponsible and unsustainable seal quotas , our government should take immediate steps to end the commercial seal slaughter through a federal sealing industry buyout			0

@entity1 seal hunt is the largest marine mammal cull on the planet
the 2015 quota given to hunters by the government is 468,000 seals
mainly killed for their furs , but also to make seal oil and aphrodisiacs
@entity353 quota has been over 400,000 for years , despite *decline* in market
bans on import of seal pelts has lead to complete collapse in sales
