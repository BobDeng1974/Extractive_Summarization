one in four homeowners say they will be in financial trouble when interest rates rise , according to research			1
a study found seven per cent believed they would be in ‘ serious difficulties ’ if their mortgage repayments increased , while 20 per cent would be in ‘ slight ’ financial trouble			1
the report , published by the @entity10 and the @entity11 , also found that a fifth will be forced to cut back on essentials like clothing and food , while two - fifths will spend less on holidays and eating out			0
one in four homeowners said they would be in financial trouble when interest rates rise and seven per cent believed they would face ' serious difficulties ' in making repayments the study found 12 per cent will have to work longer hours to keep up with repayments and six per cent will have to move to a cheaper property			1
@entity23 , the governor of the @entity24 , has signalled that the base rate , frozen at a historic low of 0.5 per cent since 2009 , could be ‘ beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually ’			1
while the @entity24 says any rise would be ‘ gradual and limited ’ , research shows that many who took out their loans when interest rates were low may struggle to meet higher monthly repayments			1
@entity33 , chief executive of the @entity11 , said : ‘ after all these years , mortgage - payers are in for a big financial shock when interest rates begin to rise			1
‘ for many , that shock will be too much to absorb – and there is a real risk that we will see a surge in unmanageable debt problems as a result			2
‘ our message to borrowers is clear – interest rates will rise and that day is coming soon , so now is the time to prepare			1
‘ draw up a budget , speak to your lender , and if you do find yourself struggling to repay , seek free debt advice as early as possible			0
’ the @entity52 poll surveyed more than 2,000 mortgage borrowers			2
@entity23 , the governor of the @entity24 , has signalled that the base rate , frozen since 2009 could be ' beginning to increase ' by spring @entity54 , head of mortgage policy at the @entity10 , warned that ‘ many consumers are only used to a low rate environment ’			1
he said : ‘ these results indicate the sensitivity of people ’s monthly spending to changes in general household expenditure , indicating that as mortgage rates rise this could have a significant impact on economic recovery			1
‘ whilst most mortgage rates are not linked quite so directly to the base rate as they used to be , rates will rise as it increases			1
’ while some homeowners said they planned to work more hours to earn extra money if rates rose , mr @entity54 said this ‘ may not be within their control ’			1
he added : ‘ our advice to those concerned about interest rate rises is to start thinking about how they will manage the increased costs			2
’ the study found 12 per cent will have to work longer hours to keep up with repayments and six per cent will have to move to a cheaper property this month , two members of the @entity24 ’s rate - setting committee voted for a second time in favour of a base rate rise			1
@entity91 and @entity92 said the @entity24 needed to act now in order to pre-empt wage and inflationary pressures ahead , but were out - voted by the other seven members of the @entity97			1
it is thought the @entity24 will wait until it sees stronger signs of wage growth before increasing the rate			1
the pay rise for the average worker increased by just 0.7 per cent over the last year , less than half the current rate of inflation at 1.5 per cent			1
@entity107 mp @entity106 , who sits on the treasury select committee in the @entity109 , recently suggested a premature rise in interest rates would be a catastrophe for millions of families			2
he said : ‘ there is definitely a feeling now that interest rates will start to rise			2
when the day comes there will be households holed below the water line , and they will be in trouble			0
‘ the problem is that there is a huge amount of household debt in the country			0
people have forgotten that 0.5 per cent is an emergency level of interest rates			2
it is not normal at all			0
‘ if you are a saver , rising interest rates are fantastic			2
if you are a borrower it is bad news and for those that are already struggling , or close to struggling , raising interest rates will be a catastrophe			2
’ with rates tipped to rise , some homeowners might find it 's worth paying the charge to leave a mortgage deal early in order to lock in to low interest offers for the longer term			1
there are some decent five or even six year fixes currently available , which will enable you to make the most of manageable rates , despite the predicted hikes			0
in many cases the difference in repayment costs will balance fabourably against the fees charged by your old lender			0
