@entity1 's @entity0 casts his eye over saturday 's controversial incidents in the @entity4 - and there were plenty			2
poor weekend @entity7 and his management team might want to check their appointments system as their inexperienced line - up left more questions than answers this weekend			0
perhaps the game of the day was given to @entity16 , while @entity17 and @entity18 were trusted with big games in @entity20 and clearly angered the managers with some of their decisions			1
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity16 ( left ) took charge of @entity26 's match with @entity27 , while @entity18 ( right , talking to @entity28 ) was the man in the middle at @entity30 vs @entity31 per @entity33 and @entity34 protest to referee @entity17 during @entity36 's draw with @entity37 the more experienced referees in @entity39 and @entity40 were given routine outings at @entity42 and @entity43 respectively			1
also , is n’t it time the tv production companies educated their commentators to not mislead those watching ? the worst culprit this weekend was @entity48 , whose description of the @entity51 penalty appeal was embarrassingly inept			0
@entity52 had played the ball past @entity54 in the @entity42 goal when the keeper clattered into the attacker			0
@entity42 goalkeeper @entity54 sends @entity51 striker @entity52 flying referee @entity39 waved away the appeals of @entity51 's @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 @entity48 thought the penalty was n’t given as the ball had been played away – @entity63 – and that had the penalty been given then @entity54 had to be dismissed – @entity66			2
the ball was in play , so the foul should have been given and @entity51 a lifeline at 0 - 2			0
however , as the ball was going wide an obvious goal scoring opportunity was not denied and @entity54 had to stay on the pitch			0
@entity16 penalty fest the match at the @entity76 was remarkable due four penalties being awarded and only two were converted			1
penalty 1 : this was the worst decision of them all			0
@entity82 threw himself to the ground at feeling the slightest of touches from @entity86			0
one could argue , as there was contact , technically the penalty award was not wrong but it was so soft it perhaps told us more about @entity82 than @entity16			2
@entity82 goes down under the slightest contact from @entity86 for @entity26 's first penalty @entity95 sweeps home the penalty for the first of his four goals in @entity26 's 4 - 1 win penalty 2 : the clearest of the four			2
@entity101 completely wiped @entity102 out and looked suitably embarrassed about his challenge			0
penalty 3 : this was the most interesting			0
watching @entity106 , you can see he trips @entity107 when tracking him from behind			0
his eyes give the foul away , which was correctly given , but was the contact inside the penalty area ? replays clearly showed @entity106 make contact with @entity107 outside the box penalty 4 : this time @entity16 was absolutely right to award a penalty , as @entity116 clearly fouls @entity95 to prevent his forward run on to a cross			1
however , the red card was wrong as it is not clear @entity95 would have met the cross or scored			1
referee @entity16 shows @entity27 defender @entity116 a red card after pulling down @entity95 @entity18 angering @entity122 @entity18 clearly upset @entity122 with his performance , but to be fair to @entity18 pretty much every referee does that			1
the issues started when @entity18 , in keeping with current trends , chose not to caution @entity128 for his first tackle , a poor one which led to @entity31 ’s first goal			1
then he let @entity28 escape with a similarly poor tackle , but it was his first and so in keeping with his performance			2
@entity30 players surround referee @entity18 after @entity136 's bad tackle @entity136 is shown the red for his shocking tackle in the first half @entity18 brandishes a red card to @entity30 's @entity128 shortly afterwards palace manager @entity122 was left fuming by @entity18 's performance there can be no arguments about the red card issued to @entity136 for a shocking tackle , nor the first of @entity148 ’s yellow cards – he had been given his chance			1
then there was his second yellow card , technically correct and a really silly challenge which gave the @entity31 players the opportunity to pressurise the inexperienced @entity18 into levelling things up – which he duly did			1
to see @entity122 grabbing his players at the final whistle to instruct them not to shake @entity18 ’s hand was disappointing but not surprising			1
his childish antics and attitude to referees is par for the course unfortunately as age does nothing to mellow the angry manager .			0

inexperienced referees were entrusted with big games on saturday
there was a penalty fest at the @entity76 but @entity16 gave two incorrectly
@entity116 's red card was also *debatable*
@entity18 *annoyed* @entity30 manager @entity122
he sent off @entity136 and @entity128 , but not @entity28
