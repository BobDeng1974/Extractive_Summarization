@entity1 , 79 , was just yards away from his doctors ' surgery when his car ran out of petrol and stalled in the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the grandfather - of - four then spent more than five minutes trying to push his light blue @entity21 off the road to make sure it was no longer a hazard to other motorists before heading to a nearby newsagents to phone for help			1
but he was left stunned when he returned a few minutes later to find a ' jobsworth ' traffic warden had left a £ 70 ticket on his car windscreen for blocking the carriageway			1
the retired financial advisor said : ' when i grew up , if the village bobby had come along and found a driver in that predicament , his instinct would have been to take off his jacket , roll up his sleeves and help move the car			2
' this jobsworth clearly must have seen me struggling - yet instead of helping he was more concerned about the money that could be made			0
' it is a sad reflection of the way that we live in a very selfish society - it reflects the lack of civility and common courtesy			0
' mr @entity1 now plans to protest against the £ 70 fine issued by the warden employed by @entity54			1
mr @entity1 , who lives with long - term partner , @entity55 , 68 , added : ' it was annoying because a couple of more able - bodied , younger men were laughing at my efforts to move the car rather than try to help me			2
' it took an almighty effort to move the car - it must weigh a tonne - and i was absolutely shattered as it was one heck of an effort			0
destination : mr @entity1 was just yards away from the car park entrance of his doctor 's surgery in @entity18 , @entity19 , when his car ran out of petrol and stalled in the @entity73 rules of the road : mr @entity1 was given the ticket for causing an obstruction to other motorists by blocking the carriageway on @entity80 , pictured , in @entity18 , @entity19 ' i got it as far as the sleeping policeman - the traffic hump in the road - and then i could not get any further			1
' it was an amazing effort to push it as far as i did - and where it stopped certainly was not obstructing anybody and then i went to call @entity55 to bring some petrol from the lawnmower			0
' as i was stood in the shop , the newsagent said " someone is fiddling with your windscreen " and by the time i got out to the car , the ticket had been slapped on there - i think he may have been on a scooter as it was that fast			0
' @entity103 , @entity54 ’s parking manager , said : ' if anyone wishes to challenge a penalty charge notice , then there are set procedures to follow , laid down by the @entity108			0
' if there is a claim that a vehicle has broken down , then we would need evidence to support that - such as the relevant repair bill or details from breakdown assistance services			0
' appeal : mr @entity1 found the ticket on his windscreen after he briefly left his vehicle to call for help			2
he plans to appeal against the £ 70 fine issued by a warden employed by @entity54			2
