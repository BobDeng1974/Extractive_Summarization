@entity0 has urged @entity1 to step up their bid for a top - four place , admitting it is hard watching their rivals play in the @entity7 this season while @entity10 ’s side are excluded from @entity12 ’s elite			1
@entity0 moved to @entity13 from @entity14 in a £ 37.1million deal a year ago this week but was unable to help his new club finish any higher than seventh after their disappointing season under @entity17			1
it meant that @entity1 missed out on @entity7 football for the first time in 19 years , and their place in the top - four is once again under threat from a chasing pack after a run of two wins from their last six league games			1
@entity0 has urged @entity1 to step up their bid for a top - four place this season @entity0 ( left ) admits it is hard to watch @entity1 's rivals play in the @entity7 this term , as they miss out @entity0 warned that @entity32 ’s side are entering a decisive stage of the season as they prepare to meet bottom club @entity35 at @entity13 on saturday , and must go on a winning streak to avoid another season of frustration			1
‘ it ’s difficult watching the games on tv every tuesday and wednesday , ’ said the @entity40 midfielder			2
‘ it ’s the thought that we all have in our minds that we need to be back in the @entity7			1
‘ it ’s the most attractive competition in the world – we need to be there again			2
‘ this is our main objective for this season , to play champions league football again because i think this club should always play in the @entity7			1
‘ it is going to be a fight until the end and not just between two teams			2
it will be between three , four , five teams , that we are now in a short difference of points			2
@entity0 joined @entity1 for £ 37.1million from @entity14 in january 2014 , as @entity1 finished seventh in the league ‘ we know we are arriving into a crucial moment for the season			1
the last months , the last 10 or 15 games probably , are the most important			2
we know we have to perform			2
‘ it ’s very important , not just to win the games against your big rivals but also the weaker teams			0
if you want to be in the top four at the end of the season , you have to win almost every game			1
it does n’t matter if it ’s @entity35 or @entity77			1
we have to go into the games trying to win			0
’ asked why the goals have dried up in recent weeks , with @entity1 scoring just five times in their last six games in all competitions , @entity0 replied : ‘ i do n’t know why			1
i ’m sure we will create chances again and i ’m sure we will score goals again because we have very good strikers and very good midfielders			0
the chances will come for sure , hopefully this saturday			1
‘ we ’ve played very good football in some games , especially in november and december			1
we have to look back at how we did it and to do it again – because i think we can do it			0
‘ the way the manager wants to play is attractive for the fans and attractive for the players			0
it ’s just a matter of doing it how he wants			0
’ @entity0 was on the scoresheet ( right ) as @entity1 won 3 - 0 against fierce rivals @entity103 in december @entity0 has settled in among a growing number of @entity106 speaking players at @entity13 following @entity1 ’s £ 150m transfer spending last summer			1
he added : ‘ sunday was one year exactly			0
obviously last season was not the best year in the history of the club but i ’m very happy here			2
‘ i ’ve scored some goals , i ’ve assisted on with some goals			0
i ’m looking forward to doing it more and more and trying to help the team get back to fighting for the title			0
this is what we have to do			0
’ the arrival of @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 has increased the competition for places among @entity1 ’s @entity124			1
it has led to problems accommodating them all but @entity0 insists that he is happy with his playing time this season			1
@entity119 ( right ) is one of many @entity106 speakers at @entity13 , along with @entity0 ‘ he is trying is to put the players in positions for the sake of the team , ’ said the 26 - year - old			0
‘ obviously we have a lot of players and it ’s difficult for him to figure out how to do it			0
‘ i guess it has to be difficult for the manager to choose from all the players we have , especially in attack			0
but i think it is also good for him because he has so many options			0
‘ he is experienced enough to handle it			0
for me personally , i feel very good and i ’m just trying to help the team with my qualities			0
‘ i think you have to see it after the season has gone to see how many games i play , to see how important i was for the team			2
i feel important and i ’ve played a lot of games so far so i ’m happy			0
‘ there is a lot of competition for the first xi in the team , not just for me , so i ’m happy that i ’ve played a lot of games and i ’m looking forward to playing more before the end of the season			2
