by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 22 august 2013 could @entity2 's meticulous personality teamed with @entity4 's neuroses be the real reason why the popular tv couple could n't conceive ? worried about your chances of having children ? the secret could be to lighten - up , say researchers			1
according to a new study published in the @entity15 , men with neurotic personality traits are having fewer children compared to previous generations			1
the study examined the effect of personality on how likely a person is to have children , using extensive survey and birth registry data from @entity24			1
it also found that men who are extroverted and open tend to have more children , while women who rank as conscientious on personality tests tend to have fewer children , regardless of which generation they are from			1
the study could have important implications for population dynamics at a time when fertility rates across developed countries have fallen to below replacement rates			2
personality effects may be one factor contributing to the decline of fertility rates in @entity41 , says @entity43 ' @entity42 , who led the study			1
population changes are an important factor for projecting future changes in sustainability , climate , energy and food security			0
in particular , @entity42 notes the decline in childbearing among neurotic men - neurotic meaning individuals who tend to be moody and emotional			0
the study found that the effect only applies for men born after 1957			2
@entity42 says that the change in these men 's fertility could be due to new norms in having children , for example that couples today wait longer to have children and couples tend to test each other out more before committing to raising children together			0
the study was made possible by @entity24 's very detailed birth records and an integrated personality survey , which allowed the researchers to examine the connections between both female and male fertility and personality			2
extrovert men may be more fertile : family - man and tv personality @entity74 with his wife @entity77 and four children @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 ' for men , often you do n't know exactly how many children they have because information is not matched in the registries , but for @entity24 we have very exact information ' says @entity42			1
while the study only considers @entity24 , @entity42 says that the findings likely apply more widely			0
' @entity24 is a leader country in terms of family dynamics , ' says @entity42 , ' many trends that have been observed first in @entity24 - increasing cohabitation , divorce rates , and later marriage , for example - have then been observed later in many other parts of the world			0
' of course it remains to be seen if this phenomenon will also spread			0
