@entity0 , the world ’s loneliest orangutan , has been moved to a new zoo where , for the first time in her life , she will mix and play with other apes			1
and those who have campaigned for her freedom after her plight was revealed by @entity9 last november hope that she will even find herself a boyfriend among her new companions			0
once the private pet of @entity15 royalty before she grew into adulthood , she was passed on to her first zoo where she was locked in a compound by day and a cage at night , living out a heartbreakingly - lonely existence			1
she will now have companions for the first time in her life @entity0 peers out through the bars of the night cage where she used to have to sleep on a concrete floor the 12 - year - old is believed to have never seen another of her species apart from her murdered mother campaigners hope the horrendous conditions @entity0 endured will now be a thing of the past visitors to the @entity40 zoo , 80 miles east of @entity41 , teased her by throwing junk food and pieces of rubbish at her and even tried to get her to smoke cigarettes that were tossed into her compound			1
when i visited the zoo i was saddened to find @entity0 , aged about 12 , sitting at the top of a dead tree staring out across houses that were spreading into the nearby jungle , her natural habitat			1
wildlife activist @entity54 , director of the @entity56 group who accompanied me to the zoo , said at the time : ‘ sadly , she thinks she ’s the only orangutan in the world - apart from perhaps having a memory of her murdered mother			1
‘ and there is no doubt her mother was murdered because no - one would be able to take a baby from its mother without being savaged			1
‘ the mother had to have been killed , perhaps by villagers or people protecting palm oil plantations , and then we believe @entity0 ended up as a pet with a member of one of @entity15 ’s royal families			1
‘ once she became too big to be kept as a pet , she was passed onto the zoo - and a new life of total loneliness began			0
‘ she does n’t even know how to behave like an orangutan			0
she has shown no natural behaviours			0
’ @entity0 had no bedding and was forced to sit on cold concrete every day for at least 12 hours after the zoo closed its doors at the end of visiting hours			2
@entity0 sitting forlornly at the top of a bare tree as suburbia spreads towards her in her old @entity93 home the forgotten ‘ wild woman of @entity97 ’ - early explorers referred to orangutans as ' @entity95 ' - came to the attention of mr @entity54 , who in turn drew my attention to @entity0 ’s unhappy life			2
‘ i only need to look into her eyes and i can see the loneliness there , ’ he said			0
‘ where is the spark that i ’ve seen in other orangutans ? she sits around without a soul nearby because everything has had to be fenced off to try to stop people throwing stuff at her			0
‘ she ’s been sitting in a tree , which has no leaves and stays there all day , doing nothing , because there has been no other orangutan for her to associate with and play with			0
‘ @entity0 has been as miserable as sin and i ’m determined to get her moved to a place where there are other orangutans and where she can be happy for the rest of her life			1
’ now mr @entity54 ’s hopes have been realised - or almost			0
while he wanted her to be moved to a rehabilitation centre , he has had to accept that @entity0 ’s rehousing in another zoo is better than keeping her in the @entity93 compound			2
@entity15 ’s @entity135 revealed today that @entity0 was moved last thursday to the @entity136 and @entity137 in @entity138 , 130 miles north of @entity41 , where she is being quarantined before she will be introduced to the other orangutans at her new zoo			1
the move came after mr @entity54 and his organisation handed over a petition to several ministries , including the prime minister ’s office , stressing the urgency to move the orangutan			0
more than 14,000 people from around the world - many of whom were moved by @entity9 ’s story - signed the petition begging for her to be moved to another zoo or sanctuary where she would be able to mix with other apes			1
@entity0 ' does n’t even know how to behave like an orangutan ' , says campaigner @entity54 within days of the petition being handed in to wildlife officials , @entity0 was being moved to her new home			1
the wildlife department has confirmed that @entity0 ’s new home was inspected last year and was found to be complying with regulations			2
once a special permit was approved , @entity0 was moved to the @entity136 where she will soon be introduced to her new friends , who are of the same species of orangutan			1
‘ it ’s not an absolutely perfect result , but it ’s much , much better than where she was , ’ said mr @entity54			0
‘ we ’re all hoping now that she will find happiness at last			0
’ today it is estimated that only 50,000 orangutans remain in the wild on the @entity177 island of @entity178 and on @entity97 , which is shared by @entity177 and @entity15			2
their world is dying around them , as trees come down to make way for oil palm plantations and adult apes and babies are hacked to death by workers protecting the planted trees			0
for those people , hungry orangutans are pests which must be destroyed			0
@entity0 enters the dingy cage where she used to have to spend 12 hours each night on a concrete floor			2

@entity0 was living in a miserable zoo with no company , toys or leafy trees
used to belong to @entity15 royal family but was being left to die alone in the *nightmarish* @entity40 zoo , 80 miles east of @entity41
but thanks to a 14,000 strong petition , @entity0 has been moved to @entity136 where she will be introduced to other orangutans for the first time
12 - year - old does **n't** act like an orangutan because she has **n't** known others
her mother was murdered when she was a baby , leaving her on her own
campaigners desperate for her to get a mate hope this could be her chance
