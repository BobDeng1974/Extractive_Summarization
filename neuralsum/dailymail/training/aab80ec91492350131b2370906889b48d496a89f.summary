@entity2 infected his patients with a deadly bug during heart surgery between december 2008 and july 2010 , when he constantly changed his gloves mid-operation			1
@entity17 , 82 , @entity18 , 67 , @entity19 , 83 , @entity20 , 73 and @entity21 , 63 , all from @entity22 , died as a result of contracting the staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria			0
an inquest in 2010 heard mr @entity2 had a habit of changing his gloves in the middle of surgery and of 28 heart patients who had valves inserted by him - 11 fell ill. the outbreak sparked a major health scare , with more than 100 patients who had undergone heart surgery at @entity37 having to be recalled for tests			1
at the time @entity40 coroner dr @entity39 slammed @entity41 for not recognising the infection quickly enough			0
but yesterday it emerged the surgeon has been allowed allowed back to work - and may return to the operating theatre - despite his fatal mistakes			1
a spokesman for the @entity41 confirmed : ' following our investigation , we commissioned an independent review by one of the country ’s eminent endocarditis experts to consider all of the evidence associated with this case and to advise on the clinical risk of the surgeon ’s return to operating			1
' this report was reviewed by two further authoritative expert microbiologists			0
' a re-entry programme is being carefully developed and has recently been shared with the surgeon and his advisers for consideration			2
the outbreak sparked a major health scare , with more than 100 patients who had undergone heart surgery at @entity37 ( pictured ) having to be recalled for tests ' this is standard practice when a surgeon returns to operating after a prolonged absence			1
we have involved patients in this process			2
' the surgeon continues to work clinically at our hospital , doing post-operative and outpatient work			0
@entity18 , 67 , a heart patient who died at @entity37 after the surgeon passed on an infection during an operation ' we will keep our community and patients informed regarding the outcome of our discussions			1
' the inquest heard suspicions were first raised about an outbreak in may 2009 year when doctors became aware of two cases of endocarditi			0
but after failing to pass on the information to an infection control doctor it was a further two months before a link was made to mr @entity2			2
the connection was finally noticed by microbiologist @entity97 and mr @entity2 was stopped from operating			1
yesterday dr @entity97 said : ' it was a busy time , and i can say that these types of things are very rare			0
' whether or not he comes back to performing operations is still in discussion			0
' the bug is carried on the skin and is normally harmless , unless it attaches to a foreign body , such as an artificial heart valve			0
lawyers representing the families of the five men who died claimed it was ' glaringly obvious ' that mr @entity2 ’s habit of changing his surgical gloves mid-operation was responsible for passing on the bacteria			2
but the surgeon and @entity9 managers said this was ' not established ' despite a coroner ruling he was undoubtedly the cause of the infection .			0
