by @entity0 this is the moment a giraffe gives birth to her calf under the watchful eye of a concerned father			1
in remarkable pictures , the giraffe @entity8 can be seen giving birth to her newborn at the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
she then rather touchingly tends to the calf as it lies looking startled on the floor of the enclosure			0
the birth , which took place on june 20 , followed a 15 - month pregnancy			1
giraffes are usually born feet first - breaking the foetal membranes before falling to the ground - severing the umbilical cord as the giraffe is the tallest living animal on earth - the newborn would have fallen about 6ft 6ins ( two metres ) during the birth			1
luckily , this calf looks to have survived its fall without any major incident - although it does appear to be a little shell shocked			2
the birth comes as another gave birth in front of a jubilant crowd at @entity46 in @entity47			0
spectators waited for two and a half hours for the mother to deliver the creature - with one person even capturing the moment on their camera			2
onlookers are said to have cheered when the calf finally arrived covered in slime moment before a sack of fluid followed			0
the giraffe - full name @entity60 - is an @entity61 even - toed mammal and is the tallest living creature on earth			2
the species name of the animal refers to its camel - like appearance and the patches of colour on its fur			0
the newborn 's mum and dad look at their calf - who appears a little startled while sitting on the floor of the enclosure			1
the parents would have tended the calf before helping it to walk a giraffe pregnancy usually lasts between 400 and 460 days			1
usually , the mother only births one calf - althought twins have been recorded on rare occasion			2
the mother gives birth standing up - with the calf usually emerging head and front legs first			1
this means the calf breaks through the fetal membranes before falling to the ground and severing the umbilical cord			0
the mother will then usually tend to her calf before helping it stand			0
most can run within a couple of hours			0
newborns are usually about 5ft 10 in ( 1.8 metres ) tall .			0
