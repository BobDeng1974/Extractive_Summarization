by @entity0 a @entity2 sniper was fatally shot by a @entity4 fighter jet in @entity5 after a mistake by the pilot meant he attacked the wrong site , an inquest heard today			1
forces on the ground had called in air support after being attacked by insurgents in @entity14			1
however , as well as having difficulty identifying landmarks when speaking to ground troops , the @entity16 pilot failed to enter coordinates for the strike			1
fatally shot : @entity23 born private @entity22 , 23 , was hit as he took cover in a ditch and died instantly as the pilot swooped to attack , private @entity22 , 23 , was hit as he took cover in a ditch and died instantly , the inquest in @entity27 , @entity28 , was told			1
@entity23 - born private @entity22 , known as @entity35 , was serving with 16 @entity37 ’s @entity36 when he was killed			1
the force had been sent to the @entity41 - e @entity40 district of @entity5 to target ‘ compounds of interest ’ which could be linked to insurgent activity			1
but on the day of the soldier ’s death the weather deteriorated and three groups were sent from their base to hold a reassurance meeting with local elders , rather than carry out manoeuvres			0
as this took place at around 12pm on december 5 , 2010 , one of the platoons came under fire and attempts were made to perform a pincer movement and repel the attackers			0
major @entity61 told the inquest : ‘ two platoon could n’t move from their position because they were pinned down and we were trying to do a manoeuvre to relieve some of that			0
’ as the battle continued , the insurgents were forced back to an area identified as compound 15 , about 100 metres ( 328ft ) from another building where the @entity77 forces had made their way to			2
background : the force had been despatched to the @entity41 - e @entity40 district of @entity5 to target ' compounds of interest ' which could be linked to insurgent activity			1
a file photo of @entity83 in the area is pictured they received intelligence from an unmanned aircraft that insurgents were in compound 15 and agreed to call in air support			1
@entity91 said : ‘ a strafing run was suggested and i was immediately very happy with that			0
’ an @entity4 @entity16 which had been circling the area was called in to carry out the attack , but a fault meant the pilot could not share his map with the ground commander , making it harder to be sure they were looking at the same point			1
commander @entity103 told the inquest this would not necessarily have been a problem had the pilot and ground commander established clear markers on the ground so they both knew what they were talking about , which they did not			2
however commander @entity103 said the biggest mistake was the pilot ’s failure to enter coordinates for the attack into his onboard computer			1
‘ you would always , always , always put that grid into the machine , ’ he said , adding that he may not have done so because he thought his targeting pod was faulty			0
‘ in that situation what he should have done , had he thought there was an error in the equipment , it should have been the first thing he mentioned , ’ said commander @entity103			0
commander @entity103 said it was not clear why the pilot did not realise friendly troops were within a danger zone of 60 metres from the intended target , as he should have seen them as he approached			2
plane : as well as having difficulty identifying landmarks when speaking to ground troops , the @entity16 pilot failed to enter coordinates for the strike			1
a file photo of an @entity16 aircraft is pictured he said : ‘ i do n’t know why he did n’t say " by my reckoning friendlies are 40 metres away "			2
’ commander @entity103 said the pilot appeared to think the @entity77 troops were in a completely different compound because he and the ground commander were not talking about the same site			0
he said : ‘ they have formed a mistaken belief that they ’re both looking at the same battle			0
’ on the ground , the troops took cover , with private @entity22 and a few others in a ditch near the compound that the rest of the group were in			1
@entity91 said : ‘ we were quite buoyed because we knew we were taking it to the enemy at this stage			0
we were almost looking forward to getting amongst it			0
’ ' they have formed a mistaken belief that they ’re both looking at the same battle ' commander @entity103 at that point the jet fired 205 rounds into the area , hitting the compound the @entity77 troops were in and the ditch			0
@entity91 said there was a lot of confusion , dust and burning as they took in the situation			0
outside , lance corporal @entity187 , a trained medic , was in the ditch with private @entity22			1
he said it was clear that the sniper died instantly			0
‘ i was desperate to do something but i knew i could not do anything for him , ’ @entity191 said in evidence			0
in the air , the pilot , who was described as ‘ very experienced ’ , realised a horrible mistake had been made			0
commander @entity103 said at this point the pilot entered the coordinates and the targeting device instantly focused on the compound where the insurgents were thought to be			2
there was no further fighting and private @entity22 ’s body was removed from the scene , with two other injured troops also evacuated			1
coroner @entity211 recorded a narrative verdict into the death of private @entity22			1
mr @entity211 said although the sharpshooter died as a result of being shot by the jet , communications issues contributed to his death			1
the coroner described how the pilot indicated that he had identified insurgent forces in one of the compounds			2
' we thought it was a very thorough investigation and it certainly answered all our questions and we are grateful that the coroner devoted time to getting to the bottom of what happened ' @entity229 , father of private @entity22 mr @entity211 said : ‘ unbeknown to the pilot and those on the ground , the pilot had identified @entity235 [ where @entity77 troops were ]			1
‘ the aircraft attacked at 13.41			0
however the compound under attack was not compound 15 but was the unmarked compound a. ‘ @entity35 , who had been laying in the ditch just short of the compound along with his comrades , was struck and @entity35 was instantly killed by one of the rounds			0
’ private @entity22 , who had been deployed in @entity14 since september 2010 , was officially declared dead at the field hospital at @entity248 at 2.57pm			2
mr @entity211 said : ‘ whilst the cause of @entity35 's death was the 20mm round fired from the attacking jet plane , communication issues between the forward air controller and pilot directly contributed to the incident			2
’ the coroner said these included the pilot failing to put attack coordinates into the on - board computer , the lack of video downlink allowing the controller to see what the pilot was looking at and the failure to agree common correlation points so they knew they were talking about the same thing			2
mr @entity211 offered his condolences to the soldier 's family			0
speaking after the inquest , private @entity22 's father , @entity274 , said : ‘ we thought it was a very thorough investigation and it certainly answered all our questions and we are grateful that the coroner devoted time to getting to the bottom of what happened			1
