the key ? the @entity14 , hi - def games - including hits such as @entity17 : revelations - are n't actually playing on your phone or tablet 's slow processor - they 're playing elsewhere , and the video streams to @entity24 , @entity1 or @entity26 devices courtesy of the new @entity28 app. the new @entity28 app allows users to play games that @entity24 's processor simply would n't be capable of such as @entity32 : @entity33 - streaming the video from high - powered servers , and adding touch controls to the ' console quality ' games the app adds an ' overlay ' of touch controls to console games , making them easier to use on @entity24 the app itself is free - but a subscription of £ 6.99 buys you access to a library of 150 games			1
renting a game for three days costs £ 3.99			0

@entity59 from @entity83 and family titles like @entity32 : @entity33 will be given free to anyone who downloads the @entity28 app. there is also an upcoming wireless controller ( £ 39.99 / $ 49.99 ) which works with many tablets and phones - overcoming one of gaming 's major hurdles on the platforms , the fact that touchscreen controls rarely work on action games			1
only 25 games have been optimised for touchscreen control so far - but you can buy a £ 39.99 controller which works with most phones and tablets ' today marks a major milestone : @entity28 is now delivering the latest , console - class , top - tier games — literally to your fingertips — on mobile tablets and phones for instant on - demand play anywhere , anytime , ' said @entity112 , @entity113 and ceo			2
