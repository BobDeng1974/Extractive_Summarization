a tractor pulling a cart full of watermelons bearing a racially charged sign stirred controversy at a small town @entity6 last week			2
‘ white history month , ’ was emblazoned on the side of farmer @entity9 ’s float in a @entity12 , @entity11 parade thursday			1
the sign also read ‘ @entity15			1
’ and as is chugged along the parade route waving a @entity18 , many residents took offense to the racial implications			0
@entity21 ' controversy : @entity12 , @entity11 farmer @entity9 tacked a sign with racial implications to his 4th of july parade float @entity12 director of parks and recreation @entity27 oversaw the parade entries			1
he told @entity31 there was no mention of the signs on @entity9 ’s float application			1
according to @entity36 , @entity9 only listed that he ’d be parading with 8 - 10 antique tractors , one with a trailer of watermelons for sale			1
@entity36 said he asked the @entity9 family to remove the sign			1
indeed , a photo of the trailer can be seen on the @entity46 website without it			2
but apparently the sign was placed back on the trailer of watermelons because photos clearly show it as the tractor and its @entity53 flag pulled through town			1
what sign ? a chamber of commerce photo snapped before the parade shows no sign			0
director of parks and recreation @entity27 said @entity9 was told to remove the potentially offense sign implications : the sign was clearly replaced , however , and toted alongside a @entity53 flag @entity64 was attending the parade with her young son and said she was completely taken aback by what she saw			1
‘ at that time his innocence was broken , and i had to sit there in the parade and explain to my son what that , at seven years old , ’ @entity71 told @entity31			0
‘ i mean it really caught me off - guard			0
’ @entity36 and town commissioner @entity76 said @entity9 had been in parades before			1
in the past , he was allowed to display his antique tractors as he did thursday , and even to wave the @entity53 flag			0
shocked : ' it really caught me off - guard , ' said attendee @entity64			0
she had to explain the sign to her 7 - year - old son this year , though , he took things further			0
‘ i know where they 're coming from , ’ @entity76 said of the townspeople like @entity71 who could n’t believe what they saw			0
‘ i know some of them were hurt by it , and it 's just something that happened , and i 'm sorry it happened			2
’ while other trailers bore signs like ‘ i did n’t vote for @entity96 ’ and ‘ @entity97 loves rednecks , ’ @entity9 ’s was just too much , said @entity71			2
‘ i think there needs to be an apology , and he needs to not be able to submit , ’ she said ‘ to be in any parade again			0
’ @entity36 is considering creating clearer , more specific guidelines for future parade entries but said he ’s unsure if @entity9 can legally be banned from pulling his tractors during next year ’s festivities			2
apology : ' i know some of them were hurt by it , and it 's just something that happened , and i 'm sorry it happened , ' said commissioner @entity76			0
