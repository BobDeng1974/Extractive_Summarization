published : 16:49 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 16:53 est , 18 may 2012 when @entity1 and @entity2 found out they were expecting their first child , they could n’t wait to tell everyone			1
but they wanted to do something different from the usual phone call or email			0
and so they invited family and friends to see their baby scan projected on to the white cliffs at @entity15 in @entity16			2
telling the world : @entity1 and @entity2 invited family and friends to their ' portrait gallery ' as they projected the 20 - week scan of their child on to the @entity15 cliffs previously , the couple had projected their 12 - week scan on to the side of the @entity25 in @entity15 and sent photographs of the event to their loved ones			1
this was such a success that they projected their 20 - week scan on to the cliffs , the walls of medieval @entity30 and the @entity31 in @entity32			1
mr @entity37 , 30 , a ceramic tiler , said : ‘ we were really excited when we found out we were going to be parents and we wanted to do something different to tell people that @entity2 was pregnant – something we could always tell our child			1
‘ with the help of a friend , we went down to the art gallery one night and used a projector to put the image on to the wall			2
‘ we kept it up for an hour and it attracted a lot of attention from passers - by			2
' even the cleaner inside the art gallery came outside to see what the fuss was about			0
‘ afterwards , we loaded the photograph on to @entity60 and all our friends loved it			0
it made it even more special for us			0
’ proud parents : the 12 - week scan of @entity1 and @entity2 's baby projected on to an art gallery wall in @entity15 the @entity67 – which was unaware of mr @entity37 ’s plans – is considering an exhibition of the couple ’s photographs and projections and has already offered the unborn child membership			1
the @entity74 used a generator to project the scan on to their chosen surfaces , choosing areas open to the public			0
mr @entity37 said he was inspired to make the extravagant announcement after his wife , a 27 - year - old beautician , started a baby diary			1
he added : ‘ it ’s a great way of capturing how we felt about the scan at that time instead of hospital scan photo paper which we may lose in 15 years			0
‘ once we have saved enough money , we are going to have a 4d scan and do something artistic with it on a larger scale , but we are keeping that under wraps for now			0
’ there has been a boom in @entity97 - style pregnancy announcements such as ‘ gender reveal parties ’ , where expectant parents announce their child ’s sex by cutting into a white cake to reveal pink or blue sponge .			2
