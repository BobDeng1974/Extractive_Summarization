by @entity0 a sea anemone is a tame , plant - like animal that leads a rather boring , slow life at the bottom of oceans or in tidal pools			1
that is , until a seabird falls into its mouth			2
and that ’s just what happened in this remarkable set of images that shows a young bird in up to its neck inside one of these water predators			0
the bird was thought to have been dead for about two days when it was found in the tidal pool in @entity27 , @entity28 in the image , a baby bird of the cormorant species is seen upside down in a tidal pool in @entity27 , @entity28			1
sea anemones are a group of water - dwelling , predatory animals classified in the phylum cnidaria			1
the polyps stick to the sea floor with an adhesive foot called a basal disk and have a column - shaped body ending in an ' oral disk '			0
most measure 0.6 to 1.2 inches ( 1.5 to three centimetres ) in diameter , but some measuring up to 6.5 feet ( two metres ) have been found			0
they can have up to a few hundred tentacles			0
the creature 's mouth is in the middle of its ' oral disk ' and is surrounded by tentacles with cells on them that protect the creatures as well as let them catch prey			1
some of the animals can sting and inject venom into prey such as small fish and shrimp			0
the venom is a mixture of toxins that paralyses the prey so it can be moved to the anemone 's mouth for digestion inside its ' gastrovascular cavity , ' which functions like a stomach			2
sea anemones are related to corals and jellyfish			1
around its neck can be seen a @entity21 , a common invertebrate			0
in the middle of the anemone is the mouth , which doubles up as an anus , out of which the bird is sticking			2
when prey enters the mouth of a sea anemone , a tiny venom - carrying dart shoots out			1
this kills or stuns the prey , normally fish and shrimp , and allows the sea anemone to chow down slowly but surely on its meal			1
and in this case it seems the poor bird has been subjected to the full might of the sea anemone			1
the researchers estimate it was a baby bird as it was too young to have significant plumage , as seen by the balding areas on it			0
' cormorant chicks are featherless at hatching and usually have natal down by 10 days post-hatch , ' the researchers write			0
they also note it was in a state of rigor mortis without noticeable decay or evidence of scavenging			0
the event occurred in a tidal pool at @entity117 in @entity27 , @entity28 exactly how the bird came to be in the water - dweller ’s mouth is unknown			1
the researchers says it ’s possible that a @entity123 dropped the chick , or it could have simply fallen from its nest			2
whether the bird was dead before it fell into anemone as well is up for debate			2
the researchers say it had been dead for no more than two days , owing to a lack of scavenging by other animals			0
events like this are incredibly rare , especially given that sea anemone 's are slow - moving animals , and it is only by chance such a situation can occur			1
when prey falls into the mouth of an anemone , which doubles as its anus , it fires a venomous dart that knocks out or kills its victim and , before further observations could be made , the tide pool filled with sand the following day and buried the anemone			1
the event itself is incredibly rare - similar finds made in 2003 and 2007 at the same location are among few known instances of this occurrence			0
the event occurred last year in @entity27 , @entity28 , but was only recently explained in a paper in the journal @entity158 .			0

a bird has been *spotted* in the *process* of being eaten by a sea anemone
the poor baby seabird in @entity28 is thought to have fallen from a *height*
it may have been dropped by an eagle flying *overhead* or fell from its nest
the @entity21 then began devouring the creature in its mouth
sea anemones use venomous darts to stun or kill their prey
