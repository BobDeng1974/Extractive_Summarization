a farmer created a stunning tribute to his late wife by planting 7,000 trees in the shape of a guitar			1
@entity7 's labour of love is a memorial to @entity10 , who loved the guitar and asked him to design the instrument on their farmland in @entity16 , @entity17			1
but , tragically she died in 1977 while carrying their fifth child before it could come to fruition			2
tribute : @entity7 used cypress and eucalyptus trees for the guitar in memory of his late wife @entity27 so , after her death , mr @entity7 and their four children planted every tree individually to create the stunning wood			1
the guitar stretches for two thirds of a mile and is so large that it has to be seen from the sky but mr @entity7 has never seen the full design because he is afraid of flying			1
he started the project in 1979 , two years after @entity27 died			2
she suffered a ruptured cerebral aneurysm during her fifth pregnancy and died aged just 25			2
@entity27 first suggested the idea after flying over land and noticing that a farm looked a bit like a milking pail			0
their son @entity49 , 36 , said his father was too busy at the time with work to take her plans seriously			0
however , after she died mr @entity7 said he regretted not fulfilling her wish			1
daughter @entity56 told the @entity57 : ' he used to talk about regrets , and it was clear he regretted not having listened to my mother about the guitar			0
' mr @entity7 's children said he regretted not taking @entity27 's idea seriously and so spent years cultivating the forest as a memorial to her and he and his family planted each of the 7,000 trees individually the tribute has been captured by satellite images but mr @entity7 has not seen it because he is scared of flying she said once they started the project all the children including elder brother @entity75 and sister @entity76 , would line up three meters apart and plant the trees where they stood			1
the family used cypress trees to create the star - shaped sound hole and the outline of the instrument and planted rows is composed of cypress trees to form the strings			0
they had to replant the saplings many times because they were eaten by hares and wild guinea pigs but eventually the trees began to grow			0
@entity76 , 39 , told the @entity57 : ' it was the closest thing possible to having my mother alive			0
' although mr @entity7 , now 70 , who also has an 11 - year - old daughter with his second partner @entity96 @entity95 , has never seen the full scale of the forest from the sky , he has seen the pictures			1
labour of love : @entity103 planted thousands of oak trees but left a heart as a tribute to his wife @entity107 a farmer in the @entity109 created a similar tribute to his wife , who died suddenly in 1995			2
