a former @entity1 pastor who set out in january to live a year without @entity2 could be set to become a full - time atheist when his eventful experiment comes to an end later this month			1
@entity6 , 43 , made headlines in january when just days into his ' intellectual experiment ' to explore atheism he was fired from his two teaching jobs at @entity12 schools near @entity13			1
@entity6 was left struggling to support his two young daughters , aged 10 and 13 , until an atheist blogger set up an online fundraising site and helped raise over $ 27,000 to help him support his family			2
then in march 2013 he resigned his position due to differences over his liberal views - including campaigning against the same - sex marriage ban for gay and lesbians - that did n't go down well with the church			0
with his 17 - year marriage also headed for divorce , @entity6 suffered a crisis of faith and in january 2014 , he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the @entity40 he decided to write a blog about that experiences called @entity45 former pastor 's @entity43			1
' for the next 12 months i will live as if there is no @entity2 , ' he wrote in his first entry			2
' i will not pray , read the @entity49 for inspiration , refer to @entity2 as the cause of things or hope that @entity2 might intervene and change my own or someone else 's circumstances			2
( i trust that if there really is a @entity2 that @entity2 will not be too flummoxed by my foolish experiment and allow others to suffer as a result )			0
' with his 17 - year marriage also headed for divorce , @entity6 suffered a crisis of faith and in january 2014 , he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the @entity40 the past 12 months has proved many testing times for @entity6 , but he tells the @entity67 that his also life has started to feel good again			1
@entity6 got a job teaching life skills at @entity71 , a nonprofit helping the homeless , and has also started dating again			1

' i do think i 've now seen both sides of the coin , ' he told the @entity67			0
' being with the atheists , they can have the same sort of obnoxious certainty that some @entity12 have , and i do n't want to be a part of that			0
it feels like i 'm stuck in the middle			0
' i want to be for something good , but i do n't want boundaries , and religion just feels like a very bounded thing			0
' the question i am asking right now : why do i need religion to love ? ' big decision : on january 1 and with his journey over @entity6 is expected to make an announcement on his blog about if he is to remain an atheist or return to @entity2			1
