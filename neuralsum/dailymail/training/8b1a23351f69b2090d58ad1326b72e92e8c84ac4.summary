by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:20 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 14:37 est , 2 january 2014 train firms barely make a profit , the rail minister insisted today as passengers were hit with @entity8 fare rises of 3.1 per cent , three times higher than average increases in pay			1
@entity12 denied operators were using the railways as a ' cash cow ' , with companies making ' less than three pence in the pound ' as profit			1
but despite government efforts to limit annual rises to the rate of inflation , passengers returning to work today complained of high costs and poor service with some annual season tickets now costing more than £ 5,000			1
the increase on unregulated fares , typically off - peak leisure tickets , is not capped			2
the regulated fare increase pushes some commuters into the £ 5,000 - a - year club , with annual season tickets to @entity41 from @entity42 and @entity43 costing £ 5,012			1
but despite the cost of a ticket , many commuters struggle to find a seat and are forced to stand , with ministers now considering paying rail firms millions of pounds to remove first class carriages to free up space for standard class passengers			2
despite the latest round of fare hikes , rail minister mr @entity12 insisted profit was ' certainly not the aim '			1
' that can not be the aim if you look at the reality			0
the idea that there ’s a huge amount of cash cow is just a nonsense			1
the average operator earns less than three pence in the pound , ' he told @entity70 's @entity69			0
' the reality is that this is a government that for the first time is guaranteeing to spend £ 16billion over the next five years , @entity71 will be spending £ 38billion over the next five years , putting in extra seats , extra capacity , upgrading the infrastructure of this company			0
much of the fares passengers pay go exactly to that			0
' but a new study shows that rail fares are rising so fast that the government will be making a profit from passengers by 2018			1
the report said that by then fares revenue will cover 103 per cent of the operating costs of the railways – up from 80 per cent in 2009			2
research has found rail fares are rising so fast that the government will be making a profit from passengers by 2018 average rises in regulated fares like season tickets have been capped at 3.1 per cent , in line with the rate of inflation in july			1
but with wages increasing by only 1 per cent a year , the costs increase the squeeze on family finances and mean some annual season tickets now cost more than £ 5,000			1
the impact on annual tickets includes : @entity109 - @entity108 jan 2013 : £ 964 , jan 2014 : £ 992 , increase 2.9 % @entity41 £ 3,952 , £ 4,076 , 3.13 % @entity110 £ 4,864 , £ 5,012 , 3.04 % @entity111 - @entity41 £ 4,836 , £ 4,984 , 3.06 % bedford - @entity41 £ 4,172 , £ 4,300 , 3.07 % @entity112 £ 3,112 , £ 3,208 , 3.08 % @entity113 £ 9,184 , £ 9,468 , 3.09 % @entity114 £ 4,864 , £ 5,012 , 3.04 % @entity115 £ 2,896 , £ 2,980 , 2.9 % @entity116 £ 3,876 , £ 3,996 , 3.1 % @entity117 £ 3,224 , £ 3,320 , 2.98 % @entity118 £ 4,864 , £ 5,012 , 3.04 % @entity119 £ 1,992 , £ 2,032 , 2 % @entity120 £ 1,008 , £ 1,040 , 3.17 % @entity121 - @entity41 £ 4,620 , £ 4,772 , 3.29 % @entity122 - @entity41 £ 4,132 , £ 4,260 , 3.1 % @entity123 £ 3,632 , £ 3,732 , 2.75 % @entity124 £ 4,304 , £ 4,432 , 2.97 % the report by @entity126 commissioned by the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) also showed that by 2018 , the government 's funding of the railways will have fallen to just 20 per cent , down from 38 per cent in 2009			1
under the capped price - rise formula , each january rise is calculated from the @entity133 of inflation figure for the previous july , which was 3.1 per cent			1
but train companies can also use a 2 per cent flexibility regulation , which lets them put some regulated fares up by 5.1 per cent , provided their overall average does not exceed the 3.1 per cent cap			1
in the cold and dark at @entity143 in @entity41 , travellers spoke of their anger at the annual rise and their view that rail travel offered poor value for money			2
' it 's a lot of money for a poor service , ' said teacher @entity153 , 30 , as he waited to board a train to @entity155 with his friend @entity156 , 33			0
mr @entity153 was on a leisure trip today but he and mr @entity156 normally commute to work in @entity41 from @entity159 in south west @entity41			0
mr @entity153 said : ' fares are pretty high			0
my salary has just gone up 1 % but fares are rising around 3 %			0
there are delays on practically every day			0
' mr @entity156 said : ' we 're not really getting value for money			0
at @entity170 ( in south @entity41 ) you can hardly get on a train			0
' @entity173 's shadow transport secretary @entity172 said the fare rise was ' a continuation of @entity177 's cost - of - living crisis ' , while @entity178 , general secretary of the @entity180 transport union , said 2014 was ' all set to be another year of racketeering and greed on @entity184 's privatised railways '			2
sustainable transport organisation @entity185 said : ' commuters will still feel the pinch this new year because salaries are n't increasing by anywhere near the level of inflation			0
' consumer group which ? said the fare increases ' will be a blow to people already feeling the financial squeeze ' , while campaign group @entity199 said : ' this latest fare rise comes after 10 years of inflation - busting fare increases , meaning that our trains are easily the most expensive in @entity204			1
' the report also showed that by 2018 , the government 's funding of the railways will have fallen to just 20 per cent the @entity127 wants the government to switch the measure on which they allow inflationary fare rises from ' retail ' to the ' consumer ' index of inflation , which they say is more in line with incomes			2
the @entity127 report said that between 2008 and 2013 the cost of a weekly season ticket from @entity222 to @entity41 has increased by 25 per cent , while average take - home pay rose by 9 per cent			0
@entity127 chief executive @entity224 said : ' the government must re-examine its fares policy as a matter of urgency and commit to a fairer system in line with the consumer price index so that fares only rise in line with wages			2
' the call comes as rail unions stage a protest today at @entity143 in @entity41 highlighting the high cost of fares which they blame in part on the costs of rail privatisation .			0

regulated rail fares rise by 3.1 % , after ministers axed inflation - busting hike
but increase is three times higher than average growth in wages
latest round of price rises pushes more commuters into £ 5,000 club
rail minister @entity12 denies railways are treated as a ' cash cow '
