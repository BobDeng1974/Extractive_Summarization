it had all the trappings of a down - home country fair somewhere well below the @entity3 : @entity14 medleys , mile - long lines for fried chicken , barbecue and draft beer , and a plethora of @entity10 flags emblazoning everything from belt buckles to motorcycle vests to trucker caps			1
but sunday 's party marking the 150th anniversary of the end of the @entity20 took about 5,000 miles ( 8,000 kilometers ) south of the @entity21 , in a rural @entity23 town colonized by families fleeing @entity25			1
for many of the residents of @entity29 and neighboring @entity30 in @entity23 's southeastern @entity32 state , having @entity10 ancestry is a point of pride that 's celebrated in high style at the annual ' @entity36 , ' or ' @entity37 ' in @entity38			1
proud heritage : descendants of @entity42 southerners wearing @entity10 - era uniforms pose for pictures as they attend a party to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the end of the @entity20 in @entity29 , @entity23 on sunday thousands turn out every year , including many who trace their ancestry back to the dozens of families who , enticed by the @entity23 government 's offers of land grants , settled here from 1865 to around 1875			1
they 're joined by country music enthusiasts , history buffs and locals with a hankering for buttermilk biscuits or a fondness for ' @entity61			0
' ' i do n't speak @entity63 and the only place i 've been to in the @entity65 is @entity66 , but i feel the heritage , ' said 77 - year - old @entity68 , whose great - great - grandparents migrated from @entity70 along with their 15 - year - old son			1
' my great - grandfather married a @entity23 woman , so he integrated into @entity23 culture pretty quickly , but it 's really important to me to come out every year to remember where we come from			1
' the party takes place up a dusty dirt road flanked on both sides by sugarcane plantations , in a field that abuts on the ' @entity83 , ' or ' @entity84 , ' which began as the resting place of the wife and two daughters of one of the first @entity36 and still serves their descendants today			0
amid food and beer stands bedecked with red - white - and - blue ribbons , extended families tucked into diet - busting barbecue and hamburger lunches as ' @entity97 ' played on a loop			1
teenage girls pulled hoop skirts over their cut - off short - shorts and wiggled into bustier tops , taking to the stage painted with a giant @entity10 flag on the arms of young men in grey and yellow @entity109 uniforms			0
the pairs solemnly presented the flags of the 13 @entity10 states and square danced to raucous fiddle music			0
but for the abundance of glitter eye shadow and the modern tattoos peeking out from beneath the uniforms , the stage had a convincing ' @entity120 ' vibe			0
@entity42 visitors @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity20 buffs who made the trip to @entity23 from their home in @entity127 , @entity128 , were sold			1
' it feels really authentic , ' gushed @entity123 , a 69 - year - old retiree originally from @entity130 , @entity131 , explaining that she first read about the @entity36 on a @entity132 posting a few months ago			2
' it piqued my interest because i 've read a lot about the history of the @entity20 and i 'd never heard about them and neither had anyone else i know			2
so we were real curious to see for ourselves			0

in those years following the @entity20 , many northerners flowed south of the @entity3 in search of economic gain			2
these so - called ' carpetbaggers ' were seen as opportunistic by many poor southerners who believed they were being used and their land stolen with the help of northern capital			2
also seen as the enemy to some @entity10 loyalists in the postbellum @entity21 were the scalawags			0
these were the @entity21 who saw more of an advantage in backing the @entity188 policies governing the reconstruction than in opposing them in favor of the throwback policies of the old gaurd			0
many of them supported giving rights to @entity196 and supported the influx of northern investors			0
as they watched @entity97 change during the federal occupation -- and watched the emancipation of black slaves -- some @entity21 chose to leave			2
a select few were enticed into settling the wild interiors of @entity42 by the @entity23 government			1
most were lured by newspaper ads placed in the wake of the war by the government of @entity23 's then - emperor , @entity211 , promising land grants to those who would help colonize the @entity42 country 's vast and little - explored interior			1
it 's not even known for sure how many people made the arduous journey			0
some historical accounts suggesting as few as 3,000 , while others say there were as many as 10,000 , predominantly from deep south states like @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225			0
the fact that slavery was still legal in @entity23 , where it was outlawed only in 1888 , may also have been a factor , though @entity230 said it was doubtful many of the @entity36 would have been able to afford slaves either in the @entity65 or in @entity23			2
the history of the @entity10 migrants is one of the lesser - known stories of the @entity20 , said @entity230 , author of the 2012 historical novel ' @entity36			1

legend has it that @entity264 himself was on hand at @entity267 's port to greet the first batch of @entity36 , mostly enlisted men and small family farmers who were then dispatched to rural areas of the surrounding states			2
difficult conditions in @entity23 swiftly took their toll			2
many succumbed to tropical diseases , while others were felled by sheer exhaustion			0
about half gave up and returned to the @entity65 , said @entity230			0
those who stayed ended up assimilating into @entity23 society , and very few of the @entity36 ' descendants speak @entity63 today			0
some are racially mixed â€” as is common in this majority @entity196 and multiracial nation			0
mixed - race guests at sunday 's party seemed unruffled by the omnipresent @entity10 flag			1
