if you have a virus on your machine , there is a very real risk you will get kicked off the internet on monday			1
web - users are being warned to ensure their computers are clear of the nasty ' @entity9 bot '			2
this piece of software found its way onto hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide late last year			1
the software was designed to re-direct you away from trusted websites , towards spoof websites in a bid to steal financial and personal information			1
when the attack was noticed , the @entity20 took the unusual step of setting up a ' safety - net ' , routing infected machines through their server to stop the ' spoof ' attacks			1
but these servers will be taken down on monday , and when this happens , people still infected are likely to lose their internet connection without warning			2
internet shutdown : software called @entity9 attempts to change the website you visit - and those infected may get cut off on monday the warnings about the problem have been splashed across @entity39 and @entity40			1
internet service providers have sent notices , and the @entity20 set up a special website			1
despite repeated alerts , the number of computers that probably are infected is more than 277,000 worldwide , down from about 360,000 in april			2
of those still infected , the @entity20 believes that about 64,000 are in the @entity48			1
if you are worried about this , and want to put your mind at ease , follow these steps : 1 ) visit this @entity20 - approved site - http://www.dns-ok.us - and see if you get an ' all - clear ' green background or an ' at risk ' red background			1
2 ) if you have a red background , visit http://www.dcwg.org/fix which lists free virus scanner and removal software			2
our personal recommendations from the free range are @entity64 and @entity65			2
for more information , visit here : http://www.dcwg.org/detect / users whose computers are still infected on monday will lose their ability to go online , and they will have to call their service providers for help deleting the malware and reconnecting to the @entity74			1
the problem began when international hackers ran an online advertising scam to take control of more than 570,000 infected computers around the world			0
when the @entity20 went in to take down the hackers late last year , agents realised that if they turned off the malicious servers being used to control the computers , all the victims would lose their internet service			1
in a highly unusual move , the @entity20 set up a safety net			1
they brought in a private company to install two clean internet servers to take over for the malicious servers so that people would not suddenly lose their @entity74			0
but that temporary system will be shut down at 12:01 a.m. edt ( 4.01am gmt ) on monday , july 9			0
most victims do n't even know their computers have been infected , although the malicious software probably has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software , making their machines more vulnerable to other problems			0
but popular social networking sites and internet providers have got more involved , reaching out to computer users to warn of the problem			0
if you wish to check if your computer is at risk , visit http://www.dns-ok.us ( linked above ) and hopefully you will see the ' all clear ' sign according to @entity110 , an @entity20 supervisory special agent , many internet providers are ready for the problem and have plans to try to help their customers			1
some , such as @entity113 , already have reached out			0
the company sent out notices and posted information on its website			0
because the company can tell whether there is a problem with a customer 's internet server , @entity113 sent an email , letter or internet notice to customers whose computers appeared to be affected			0
@entity110 said other internet providers may come up with technical solutions that they will put in place on monday that will either correct the problem or provide information to customers when they call to say their @entity74 is n't working			2
if the internet providers correct the server problem , the @entity74 will work , but the malware will remain on victims ' computers and could pose future problems			0
in addition to individual computer owners , about 50 @entity142 companies are still infected , @entity110 said			1
both @entity39 and @entity40 created their own warning messages that showed up if someone using either site appeared to have an infected computer			0
facebook users would get a message that says , " your computer or network might be infected , " along with a link that users can click for more information			0
@entity40 users got a similar message , displayed at the top of a @entity40 search results page			0
it also provides information on correcting the problem			0
to check whether a computer is infected , users can visit a website run by the group brought in by the @entity20 : @entity165			2
the site includes links to respected commercial sites that will run a quick check on the computer , and it also lays out detailed instructions if users want to actually check the computer themselves .			0
