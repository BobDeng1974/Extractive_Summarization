by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 16:11 est , 3 march 2014 bullying was a factor in the death of corporal @entity7 - @entity6 who committed suicide in an army barracks , an inquest recorded today bullying was a factor in the death of corporal @entity7 - @entity6 who committed suicide in an army barracks , an inquest recorded today			1
coroner @entity15 ruled that the ' lingering ' mental effects of an alleged rape , ' work - related despair ' and a romantic break - up all contributed to her decision to take her own life			1
mr @entity15 has now called on the @entity23 to review its care for vulnerable soldiers @entity15 concluded that corporal @entity6 hanged herself at @entity26 in @entity27 , two years after she alleged that two soldiers raped her while she was stationed in @entity29			1
but mr @entity15 said at the inquest in @entity31 that , although the care given to @entity36 in the aftermath of the allegation had been of ' high quality ' , the transfer of information when she returned to the @entity34 had been ' unforgivably bad '			1
he said he would be recommending to the @entity23 that it review its suicide vulnerability risk assessment procedures and ensure that medical personnel are regularly given refresher training			1
in a statement read outside court , @entity36 's family said they welcomed the coroner 's conclusions and recommendations			1
her sister , @entity50 , said : ' the family are delighted with this verdict we have today			1
' the coroner has confirmed what we have always known - that @entity56 was treated appallingly and let down by the @entity57			1
' she was never able to recover from the allegation of rape she made in @entity29			0
' she then suffered bullying by the @entity57 and was subjected to unacceptable work practices			1
' victims of sexual abuse in the @entity57 need proper support , which the coroner has recognised , and we are delighted with his recommendations			1
' the @entity31 inquest was dramatically adjourned last week as new evidence emerged on what was to be the final day of the hearing			0
it was revealed that three mobile phones and a pink 2010 - 11 diary belonging to corporal @entity6 had mysteriously vanished from her barracks after she died			1
the previously unmentioned items were listed on an inventory made by a fellow soldier			0
it was among 1,400 files newly discovered by the @entity23 legal team			1
she had scrawled ' i 'm sorry ' in lipstick on the mirror of her room , the inquest heard the 30 - year - old from @entity89 was found in 2011 hanging from a fire escape at her camp in @entity26 , @entity27			1
she had written ' i 'm sorry ' in lipstick on her mirror			0
the inquest - which lasted three weeks - heard that @entity36 alleged she had been raped by two soldiers in november 2009 , while she was posted in @entity29			1
it heard that she had been left ' absolutely devastated ' by the decision taken by military investigators not to prosecute them			2
mr @entity15 said : ' it is not the function of this inquest to make a determination whether @entity56 was raped , that may be for another court to determine , nevertheless i find as fact that @entity56 believed she was raped and was deeply affected by what for her was a deeply humiliating experience			2
' he ruled that although the @entity23 had a policy in place for caring for victims of alleged sexual assaults within the @entity57 , a review was needed to ensure that all steps were taken to support the victims , particularly in cases where the allegation was made against a colleague			1
he explained that although @entity118 was placed on the @entity57 's sexual vulnerability risk assessment register , this information was not transferred to her medical professionals when she was brought to the @entity34			0
he said : ' i find the welfare provided in @entity29 was good but the transfer of information unforgivably bad			0
' he added : ' i have concerns in relation to the support and welfare support given to a soldier following an allegation of sexual assault			0
' there is an existing code of practice on services to be provided by the armed forces to victims of crime and sexual assault , i ask that that code of practice be reviewed			0
' however , mr @entity15 said that he felt this issue was not a significant factor in @entity36 's death because she had shown an improved state of mind upon her arrival at @entity26			0
he ruled that there were two periods when he believed that @entity36 had been subjected to bullying - one by the girlfriend of one of her alleged rapists			1
mr @entity15 said she had directed her anger at the incident at @entity118			0
he said : ' i find as a fact that deliberate action was taken to make @entity56 's final days in @entity29 uncomfortable and the actions and that deliberate action was harassment			0
' @entity36 was being bullied and was ' scared to leave her room ' , her mother , @entity162 , right , said he said it was ' unduly optimistic ' of her superiors to keep @entity36 and those who accused her of lying about the rape within the same accommodation block without trouble occurring			0
the other incident of bullying that mr @entity15 identified was in 2011 at @entity26 when @entity118 's superior officer			1
staff sergeant @entity174 had made a posting on @entity176 deriding the quality of work that he was inspecting			2
he said that @entity36 believed this criticism identified her shortcomings to her colleagues and was something that troubled her ' again and again '			0
he said : ' i find it was inappropriate for a senior @entity188 ( non-commissioned officer ) to make a posting about a junior nco on a social media website and further inappropriate to have friends who were junior ncos able to read the posting			0
' although not imbued with evil intent , it resulted in bullying			2
' hopes : even as a child , @entity7 - @entity6 had dreamt of joining the @entity57 , an ambition she fulfilled in 2006 mr @entity15 said that the other factors involved in @entity36 's suicide was her perception that she was over-worked			2
he said that although she reported that she had been working up to 90 hours in a nine - day period in the weeks prior to her death , she was liable to ' exaggeration '			2
he explained although he did not feel the @entity23 had over-worked her , @entity36 was feeling stressed about her job and was suffering from ' work - related despair '			1
another significant factor was a recent relationship breakdown			0
the inquest heard that she has sent messages speaking of her sense of betrayal to her former boyfriend on the day that she committed suicide			2
mr @entity15 also explained how @entity36 had suffered sexual abuse and bullying as a child and had previously been raped at the age of 18			1
he said that she continued to complain of bullying both in civilian life and when she joined the @entity57 , which had been a lifelong ambition			2
he said that she suffered ' poor body image and low self - esteem ' and their was a ' correlation between her physical and mental health '			2
mr @entity15 explained that she was diagnosed as suffering from depression in 2009 and was prescribed anti-depressants			0
a previous inquest in march 2012 recorded a conclusion that @entity36 , originally from @entity89 in @entity230 , took her own life			0
but last august , the @entity233 ordered a fresh hearing , which began in @entity31 on february 3.during the inquest , @entity36 's family claimed she had felt bullied by colleagues and without support in the @entity57			0
her sister , @entity50 , 44 , a married mother - of - four from @entity239 , @entity230 , told the inquest : ' when she died , my immediate thoughts were the @entity57 , the rape , the bullying and the overwork			1
' corporal @entity247 , 30 , originally from @entity89 in @entity230 , who was found hanged at @entity26 after saying she had been raped , with her sisters , @entity249 ( left ) and @entity50			1
ms @entity50 said : ' the family are delighted with this verdict we have today ' the hearing was adjourned last week after the court heard an inventory listing items including three mobile phones and a pink diary found in @entity36 's room had been discovered by the @entity23 but in a statement given to the court , @entity36 's father confirmed that he had received the items including the diary and five mobile phones			1
he said that he had passed on the diary to @entity36 's mother @entity162 and he had disposed of most of the mobile phones because of their age but had held on to her @entity270			2
following the inquest , brigadier @entity272 , director of personnel services for the @entity23 , said : ' the @entity57 deeply regrets the tragic death of @entity275 and although there were aspects of her care that were praised , i want to apologise to her family for the failures that the coroner has identified			1
' this second inquest has been an extremely thorough investigation by her majesty 's coroner and @entity56 's family has shown great dignity throughout			2
we now have a clear understanding of the complex circumstances surrounding her death and where the @entity57 needs to learn lessons			0
' our priority is to study the coroner 's conclusions and then identify what further steps can be taken , to help prevent a recurrence of this kind of tragedy in the future			2
at present , however , our thoughts and sympathy lie with @entity56 's family and her friends at this difficult time			0
' @entity310 , legal officer for human rights charity @entity311 and the lawyer representing @entity36 's sisters , said : ' soldier or civilian , your human rights require protection			0
' yet the @entity57 failed this vulnerable , traumatised woman at every stage : an incompetent rape investigation coupled with a chain of command that repeatedly overlooked serious bullying and ignored her suffering			1
' as long as the military investigates itself , this risks happening again			0
the coroner recognised the terrible failings in @entity56 's case			0
now we need real reform			0
