by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:52 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 14:41 est , 15 november 2012 the struggling @entity3 is reporting a record annual loss totaling $ 15.9billion , while overall mail volume sinks			1
the financial losses for the fiscal year 2012 ending on september 30 were nearly $ 11billion more than the previous year			1
the numbers cap a tumultuous financial year in which the post office was forced for the first time to default on more than $ 11billion in payments to avert bankruptcy			1
postmaster general @entity17 says the large losses can not be sustained			0
@entity16 quoted @entity17 as saying : ' we are walking a financial tightrope			0
' the mail agency for months has been urging @entity22 to pass an overhaul bill to let it trim letter delivery to five days a week and reduce annual payments for future retiree health care			2
it remains unclear whether @entity29 leadership would take up the postal bill in its lame - duck session , due in part to resistance from rural lawmakers about the impact of closures in their communities			0
while urging quick congressional action , the @entity3 in its legal filings on thursday assumed a 2013 financial outlook in which @entity22 fails to act on any legislation , acknowledging the political uncertainty of the situation			1
boss : postmaster general @entity17 says the large losses can not be sustained such legislation has the backing of rep @entity47 of @entity49 , chairman of the @entity50 , according to @entity51			0
' as the nation creeps toward the fiscal cliff , the @entity3 is clearly marching toward a financial collapse of its own , ' said @entity56 @entity55 of @entity57 , a sponsor of the @entity59 bill			1
' i am hopeful that now that the elections are over , my colleagues and i can come together and pass postal reform legislation so that a final bill can be signed into law by the end of the year			0
' overall , the post office had operating revenue of $ 65.2billion in fiscal 2012 , down $ 500million from the previous year			1
but expenses climbed to $ 81billion , up from $ 70.6billion , largely due to the health prepayments			0
will the mail stop ? without @entity22 intervention , the @entity3 will run out of money by september 2013 the annual payment of roughly $ 5.6billion was deferred for a year in 2011 , resulting in a double payment totaling $ 11.1billion that became due this year			1
the @entity3 is the only government agency required to make such payments			2
the post office also has been rocked by declining mail volume as people and businesses continue switching to the internet in place of letters and paper bills			0
the number of items mailed in the last year was 159.9 billion pieces , a 5 per cent decrease , much of it in first - class mail			2
on the plus side , the mail agency reported that its fast - growing shipping services , which include express and priority mail , grew by 9 per cent , helping to offset much of the declining revenue from first - class mail			0
last month , the post office said it will increase postage rates on january 27 , including a 1 - cent increase in the cost of first - class mail , to 46 cents			0
but the rate increase , which is tied to the rate of overall inflation , will make only a small dent in financial losses			1
the @entity3 also originally sought to close low - revenue post offices in rural areas to save money , but after public opposition , it is now moving forward with a new plan to keep 13,000 of them open with shorter operating hours			1
without legislative changes , it said , annual losses will exceed $ 21billion by 2016			2
' @entity118 is facing a fiscal cliff of its own , and any unanticipated drop in mail volumes could send the agency over the edge , ' said @entity124 , co-coordinator of the @entity125 for a 21st @entity126 , a group representing the private sector mailing industry			0
' if @entity22 fails to act , there could be postal slowdowns or shutdowns that would have catastrophic consequences for the 8 million private sector workers whose jobs depend on the mail			1
' in addition , @entity16 reported that the agency could run out of money by october of next year .			2

financial losses in fiscal year were nearly $ 11billion more than the previous year
if @entity22 fails to act , @entity3 could run out of money next year - leading to 8 million job losses
