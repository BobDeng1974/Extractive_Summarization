posed by model new science graduates are half as likely to be in stop - gap jobs stacking shelves and cleaning windows as those who studied most other university disciplines , new figures have revealed			1
they are more likely to have landed professional jobs within six months of finishing their studies than graduates in fields such as history , philosophy , creative arts and even law			0
just five per cent of working science graduates have stop - gap jobs such as shelf - stacking , road - sweeping or operating factory machinery that fail to justify the effort and expense of doing a degree			1
yet 11.7 per cent of graduates in media studies , 10.6 per cent in the creative arts , 10 per cent in history or philosophy and 8.9 per cent in languages are languishing in these roles			0
science graduates – including those who studied physics , chemistry , biology , engineering , computer science and medicine – are also less likely to be unemployed six months after finishing university			2
across all disciplines , almost 20,000 graduates – eight per cent - were out of work six months after leaving university			2
the figures from the @entity52 came the day after eminent scientists warned that @entity54 was failing to produce enough scientists and mathematicians			0
the @entity57 called for all schoolchildren to study maths and science until the age of 18 to help the country tackle ‘ great global challenges ’ such as ensuring future food and energy supplies			1
a-levels should be axed in the process , said the society , to be replaced by a broader - based baccalaureate - style qualification			0
latest figures for full - time graduates who left university last year show that overall , 69 per cent were in jobs , 5 per cent were both working and studying , 14 per cent were in further study and 4 per cent were travelling			1
some 8 per cent – down from 9 per cent in 2012 – were unemployed			0
men were more likely than women to be jobless but their starting salaries were higher - £ 20,000 on average for female graduates but £ 22,500 for male			0
the statistics showed that graduates ’ chances of being jobless varied widely by the subject they studied			0
out of graduates in work , 66 per cent were in jobs classed as ‘ professional employment ’ such as teachers , solicitors , vets , dentists , pharmacists or engineers – up from 64 per cent in 2012			1
just 5 per cent of working science graduates have stop - gap jobs such as shelf - stacking , road - sweeping or operating factory machinery that fail to justify the effort and expense of doing a degree but 34 per cent – 59,600 - were in ‘ non-professional ’ roles that are unlikely to justify the £ 9,000 - a - year cost of degree tuition			1
these include working in factories and ‘ elementary occupations ’ such as office juniors , hospital porters , waiters , road sweepers , window cleaners and shelf stackers			2
other non-professional posts include skilled trades , service and caring industries , sales , customer services and secretarial work			0
just 24.7 per cent of science graduates were in non-graduate jobs six months after leaving – against 49.1 per cent of history and philosophy graduates , 47.5 per cent in languages , 46.8 in media studies and 44.6 per cent in creative arts			1
even in law , 46.1 per cent of graduates were not yet in professional roles			0
among science subjects , graduates in biology bucked the trend , with 50.8 per cent classed as being in non-professional jobs			2
overall science graduates were less likely to unemployed , with 7 per cent jobless compared with 9 per cent who read social studies , business studies or creative arts and 11 per cent who took media studies			1
computer science graduates bucked this trend , with 13 per cent out - of - work after six months			1
in a major new report published yesterday , the @entity57 warned that a million more experts in science , technology and engineering would be needed by 2020			2
launching the report , sir @entity153 , a mathematician and chair of the @entity57 ’s ‘ vision committee ’ said : ‘ the current education system will not meet the needs of the @entity54 over the next 15 to 20 years , so we need to start building a stable education system that produces scientifically literate citizens now , before it is too late			2
‘ we all know that we have significant problems with the demand for science , mathematics and engineering skills and their supply			0
we know that only one in eight 16 - year - olds goes on to do a-level mathematics			0
that ’s just not enough for a vibrant knowledge economy			0
‘ we should bear in mind for instance that one million new science , engineering and technology professionals are going to be needed by 2020 and at the current rate we ’re falling 40,000 shy of this each year			0
‘ the @entity54 will provide a leading role in providing solutions to some of the great global challenges that the world is now facing - things like climate change , food and energy security and the ageing population issue			1
’ the report proposes a series of radical reforms to the education system including the replacement of a-levels with a baccalaureate system where all pupils would study maths and science at some level until age 18 .			1
