part - time blogger @entity6 , 32 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , made the candid statement on @entity10 in a post titled ' do you actually need to @entity13 ' , prompting fellow users to brand her ' lazy ' and ' gross '			1
today , the mother - of - three defended her parenting , telling @entity18 : ' i aim for once a week			1
i will confess , it has gone longer than a week			0
it can be a good 10 days , but if you met my baby and held him , you 'd probably think he smells as amazing as i do			0
' too busy : mother - of - three @entity6 has admitted that she only bathes her three - month - old son @entity26 once a week - if that			1
fellow parents are now divided on whether she is right or wrong mrs @entity6 says that a bath every evening was a routine with her first child , now five , but since then she finds she no longer has the time			1
' my first baby got her daily baths , sometimes two bathes a day , ' she said			2
but when her pediatrician warned her that her second child 's skin was getting dried out from too many baths , she eased up			0
now baby @entity26 's nighttime routine involves a diaper change , and washing his hands and face			1
' in my gut i do n't think he needs it , ' she said			0
' he is a happy baby , he is a healthy baby			0
what i realized now after five years of parenting children is , he 's not a dirty kid , he 's a baby			0
' new routine : mrs @entity6 says that her first child was bathed every night , but when her pediatrician warned her that her second child 's skin was getting dried out from too many baths , she eased up but while a nightly bath may not be essential for babies , it seems fellow parents are loathe to leave it as long as mrs @entity6			1
@entity58 , from @entity59 , @entity60 , says she bathes her three - month - old , @entity61 , every day as part of a bedtime ritual			1
' in my gut i do n't think he needs more frequent baths			0
he is a happy baby , he is a healthy baby ' ' they are at a crucial age where they need to establish a sleep routine and having a nightly bath ( water is fine - you do n't need to use soap all the time ! ) is part of this , ' she told @entity80			1
' most babies actually enjoy being bathed plus it 's ultra soothing for them			0
' babies also drool a lot at 3 months so if you 're not washing their neck creases every day you 're in for a delightful funky smell ! ' she added			0
but fellow mother - of - one @entity89 , from @entity90 , @entity60 , found that twice a week was best for her daughter , @entity91			1
' pre-crawling i probably bathed my daughter twice a week because greasy hair is n't cute on anyone , ' she said			0
' now that she 's a toddler i bathe her every other day since she 's an avid fan of rolling in the dirt			2
' mother knows best : mrs @entity6 says that every mom has the best gut instincts about their own baby , and that little @entity26 smells ' amazing ' psychologist and mother @entity102 tells @entity80 that a potential risk in passing up bath time is that the infant may be losing out on a powerful moment of maternal connection			1
' the bathing ritual can play an important developmental role for a child in that it offers a powerful opportunity for mother infant bonding , ' she says			0
' ideally , the bath is a time for physical closeness along with face to face contact when the mom can follow her baby 's gaze - experiences that foster healthy attachment			1
' the @entity120 advises parents to bathe babies at least three times a week , but acknowledges that ' too much bathing can decrease babies ' natural bacteria count and make them more susceptible to infections and rash			0
' ' we 've learned now that baby skin is very different than adult skin , ' dr @entity129 , a @entity130 - based pediatrician , told @entity18			2
' really , you want to watch your baby more than watching the calendar when deciding to give a bath			2
' and mrs @entity6 echoes this : ' mothers know their babies , ' she said			2
' they have gut feelings about their babies , and i would never presume to tell you how often to bathe your baby			2

part - time blogger @entity6 , 32 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , says she is too busy to give baby @entity26 a nighttime bath
the mother - of - three says she used to bathe her first baby once , if not twice a day , but she realizes now that it is not necessary
