@entity0 was @entity1 's 21st prime minister from 1972 to 1975 and his rein was as short as it was spectacular			1
for a man whose first foray into politics actually ended in disappointment , failing to win a spot in local government soon after the end of @entity11 , his political life will remain forever entwined in @entity1 history			2
while his dismissal as @entity14 in 1975 by his former friend and colleague sir @entity17 is seen as the defining moment , his whirlwind policy overhaul when in power is perhaps now , certainly more than at the time , more fondly remembered			1
the changes included establishing universal health care through @entity24 ( the forerunner of @entity25 ) , ending the ' white @entity1 ' policy and fee free university education			1
the former @entity44 leader forged close ties with @entity32 long before his prime ministership @entity47 , @entity32 's president ( left ) greets then 90 - year - old former @entity1 prime minister @entity0 , prior to a ministerial dinner at the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) meeting in @entity52 in 2007 @entity0 was born on july 11 , 1916			1
his father @entity53 became @entity54 and the classically educated young @entity0 grew up in @entity55 , before studying at @entity56			2
he married @entity57 in 1942 whom he constantly referred to as ' the love of my life ' and they had three sons and a daughter			0
@entity0 joined the @entity11 @entity64 , becoming a flight lieutenant and bomber navigator			2
when the war ended mr @entity0 had linked with the @entity44 and went on to complete a law degree			2
former prime minister @entity0 pours soil into the hands of traditional landowner @entity72 , @entity73 , 1975			2
@entity75 land rights is seen as one of his major legacies to the nation on november 10 in the year 2000 the former @entity14 helps to plant a millenium tree and bury a time capsule at @entity81 in @entity52 's west , a day before the 25th anniversary of ' @entity84 ' @entity0 married @entity30 in 1942 , he often and publicly referred to her as ' the love of my life ' ' it 's @entity88 ' was the catchy slogan which took hold around the country in 1972 as @entity0 campaigned with celebrities like singer @entity92 his political breakthrough would arrive in 1951 , when @entity0 won pre-selection for the south - west @entity52 seat of @entity96 and he quickly rose to prominence in political ranks with a combination of quick wit and radical policies			1
as deputy and then - leader of the @entity44 opposition , @entity0 sought to reform @entity44 structures , particularly national and @entity106			1
he created a shadow ministry and developed a comprehensive set of policies , known as ' the program '			0
he soon established parliamentary dominance over prime minister @entity112 after assuming the leadership of the @entity44 in 1969			0
but the internal split in ranks ( prior to his taking over as leader ) which led to the @entity117 going it alone , would ultimately contribute to his undoing as @entity14			1
however , on the back of a very presidential @entity122 - style ' it 's @entity88 ' slogan ( which also took its lead from a previous @entity126 campaign ) he won office on december 2 , 1972 , ending the @entity44 's 23 years in the wilderness			2
@entity24 forged ties with @entity32 fee free university education legal aid aboriginal land rights stronger racial discrimination laws removed the dealth penalty free dental care for students poured money into public housing brought sewerage into major cities removed sales tax on contraceptives established the @entity143 extended minimum wage to include women in the workforce ended conscription removed ' white @entity1 ' policy @entity0 had flagged his foreign policies well before the election , when in 1971 he travelled to @entity32 to meet with state officials			1
he would also consistently oppose @entity1 's intervention in @entity153			2
once ensconced as @entity14 , the reforms rolled out quickly and spending rose considerably			2
indeed , in a frenetic 13 days before a full ministry could even be elected , the so - called ' duumvirate ' consisting of just @entity0 and deputy @entity158 went to work covering almost 30 portfolios			2
they would go on to take a staggering 50 plus decisions , which did not require legislation			0
the @entity0 government overhaul was quickly taking shape			2
social and political reforms went into over-drive as they arranged for the release of all @entity169 draft dodgers and an end to @entity1 's involvement there with the troops brought back home			1
there was also an end to conscription			0
the @entity178 system was set in place and government officials also went as far as organising for the release of uncensored the film ' @entity183 ' and removing sales tax on contraceptives			0
among the social reform changes , there was also the abolition of the death penalty			1
in the middle of all that , the controversial age of ' white @entity1 ' was brought to a close , as he abolished that controversial long - standing policy			1
but it was the big - ticket item which polarised opinions			0
@entity0 's government would ignite universal health care through @entity24 ( today 's @entity25 system ) , fee - free university education and put in place social welfare reform			1
what rankled with many was that while they lacked control of the @entity207 , @entity0 's government still managed to abolish fees for tertiary education , reform family law , brought the @entity54 into urban and regional development and took sewerage systems to many @entity52 and @entity214 suburbs			1
spending on @entity75 affairs ( including the returning of traditional land to @entity1 's indigenous community ) and the arts increased significantly			0
the @entity0 government also extended the adult minimum wage to include women workers for the first time , brought in the concept of no - fault divorce and provided the foundation for the @entity143 of @entity1			1
spending continued at very high levels , however , and inflation kept rising			0
but after an historic joint sitting following the 1974 double dissolution election , @entity24 ( the precursor of @entity25 ) was finally set up			0
however , it started to go wrong from christmas 1974 when @entity0 was accused of showing too little concern for the victims of @entity234			0
he fell out with several ministers and forced the speaker to resign			0
the @entity238 affair embroiled treasurer @entity239 and a loans affair forced the resignation of minerals and energy minister @entity243			0
the government 's @entity207 numbers were weakened when a @entity44 senator died and @entity248 @entity247 broke convention by nominating an anti-labor replacement			0
the @entity252 share a toast with @entity32 premier @entity36 the economy started to slow dramatically and using control of the @entity207 , @entity257 's @entity256 opposition blocked supply , effecting stopping the government from being able to pay the bills			0
and then on november 11 , 1975 came the moment which locked @entity0 forever in @entity1 political history			1
governor - general sir @entity17 resolved the stalemate caused by the @entity207 's refusal to pass the budget by dismissing the @entity0 government ( the first time in the history of @entity1 's federal parliament ) and appointing @entity257 as caretaker prime minister			1
@entity0 had long considered @entity17 a friend and he was , in fact , a @entity0 appointee			0
he had disregarded the @entity14 's advice not to seek advice from the @entity277 and had given him no idea that he might be dismissed			0
on the other hand , many critics suggest @entity0 had both misread and mismanaged @entity17			0
@entity0 looks on as his wife @entity30 greets @entity283 at the opening of the @entity285 in october 1973 @entity30 in later years revealed that her husband admitted he ' should have torn up the ( dismissal ) letter '			1
in the election following the dismissal , @entity44 suffered an unprecedented 30 - seat loss and @entity257 was confirmed as prime minister			0
@entity0 stayed on as @entity44 leader until 1977 , when he suffered another heavy defeat			1
he stepped down and was replaced by @entity294			0
@entity0 and @entity30 arrive at the @entity295 for ' the @entity0 85th @entity296 ' @entity0 , a devoted republican , would go on to receive the order of @entity1 in 1978 and was later made @entity1 's ambassador to @entity299 in @entity300			1
he was chairman of the @entity1 - @entity301 for five years and both he and wife @entity30 would be made life members of the @entity44			1
