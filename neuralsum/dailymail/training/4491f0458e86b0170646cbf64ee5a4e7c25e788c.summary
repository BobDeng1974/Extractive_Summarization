@entity1 boss @entity0 expressed his ' immense pride ' for the club ’s ' incredible ' fans after a turbulent 24 hours building up to thursday evening ’s 0 - 0 @entity5 draw at @entity6			1
the contest had been preceded by trouble in the @entity10 city involving @entity1 supporters , including an attack on some of them at a bar by a group of at least 50 men on wednesday night , and a subsequent flare - up in the main square around thursday lunchtime which saw @entity10 police use gas against them			1
the @entity23 game itself was witnessed by around 5,500 @entity1 fans in the away end of the @entity26 , but there was talk that as many as twice that amount in total had made the trip to @entity6			1
almost 6,000 @entity1 fans were in the away end of the @entity26 to see their side secure a 0 - 0 draw some @entity1 supporters were caught up in clashes with riot police ahead of the @entity5 clash @entity1 manager @entity0 was extremely complimentary of his side 's travelling support in @entity6 @entity0 did not comment on the specific incidents of trouble that had occurred , saying in his post-match press conference when asked about them : ' i heard something was reported , but do n’t know any details about it			1
' but he also said with regard to the fans : ' i can only speak from my point of view and the first thing i feel is immense pride and an incredible feeling of seeing what we are as a football club			2
' the support does n’t stop amazing me day to day - it is incredible			2
' i have seen full families coming across , some without tickets just wanting to be near the hotel and wish the players well			0
' it really meant something for thousands of them , and you keep getting closer to understanding what the @entity72 deserve			0
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity74 pays tribute to the visiting supporters after the final whistle in @entity6 @entity1 stalwart @entity78 vies for the ball with on - loan @entity81 youngster @entity80 ' i would say this will be an incredible memory and that we will be talking about this trip for a long time			1
' it gives even more strength to everyone at the club to keep fighting , making sure @entity1 can carry on progressing and keep having nights like this and success			1
the support we have is quite unique around @entity94			0
' @entity0 was pleased enough to secure a point that takes his side to five from three @entity23 games and keeps them top of the pool			1
but he was critical of the state of the pitch and admitted he could only really be half - satisfied given his team - like @entity6 - had not been able to create much in attack			1
@entity0 had particular praise for @entity106 , who did a fine job of keeping at bay the likes of @entity111 @entity112 was ordered off the field of play after sustaining a cut above his left eye in the 0 - 0 draw ' for us , it is about performing well and getting a positive result , ' the @entity118 said			2
' i was pleased in terms of players coming in ( he made six changes to his first xi ) and performing to a high standard , but i think the pitch did n’t help either side - i think with a better pitch , we would have seen a lot more brilliant attacking football from both			2
i think all in all a draw was a fair result			0
' if you could measure the pleasure at the end of the performance , it would be at 50 per cent because i thought we were fantastic defensively			0
but i did think we could n’t be ourselves ( going forward ) - the condition of the pitch did n’t allow us to take risks			0
' @entity0 had particular praise for @entity1 skipper @entity106 , who did a fine job of keeping at bay the likes of @entity80 , the forward loaned back to @entity6 after joining @entity81 over the summer			1
the manager said of centre - back @entity106 : ' nothing affects his level of performance			2
' i think the last few weeks he has been immense			0
i do think he is a step ahead of where he was before			0
' @entity0 also confirmed @entity1 midfielder @entity112 required stitches for a head injury but is expected to be fine for sunday ’s @entity158 trip to @entity159			1
' it was a cut on his eyebrow and he was bleeding heavily , ' @entity0 said			0
' i think there was a collision - an elbow or forearm			0
' the @entity6 player was trying to block his run and caught him			2
i do n’t think it was anything really malicious , but i think if the referee had seen it , he would have been punished			0
