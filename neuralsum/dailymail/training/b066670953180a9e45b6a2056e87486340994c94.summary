@entity0 and @entity1 would have both received more than £ 70million extra in @entity4 tv money had the cash been distributed based on audience			1
@entity8 ' side collected £ 97.5m in television money last season , the most in the @entity4 , but they would have been in line for £ 172.3m if the distribution was based on the number of tv viewers - a difference of £ 74.8m			1
@entity1 would have received £ 159.5m if the @entity4 split their money more evenly based on @entity18 audience			1
as it was , @entity1 picked up £ 89.1m , more than £ 70m less			2
scroll down for the full table show me the money : @entity0 collected the most in tv revenue , but would have received more the @entity4 tv money distribution is among the most balanced in the world with every club receiving a £ 52.2m basic payment with the rest of the £ 1.56billion pot being shared based on final league position and tv appearances			1
but the system means the top clubs do not receive as much money as they could , as was the case last season when @entity35 , @entity0 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity1 were all at least £ 29m worse off			1
@entity39 were the team to profit the most from the @entity4 's distribution system			2
the west @entity42 club received £ 63.3m last season but would have only collected £ 26m , a difference of over £ 37m , if the money was based on their @entity18 viewers			1
difference : @entity1 received over £ 70m less than they would have if the money was based on viewers cash : @entity35 won the @entity4 , but still missed out on over £ 40m so how did we work this out ? first of all , we collected the official viewing figures for the 154 live games on @entity54 and @entity55 during the 2013 - 14 season			1
this data came from the @entity58 ’ @entity59 , @entity60 ( www.barb.co.uk )			0
the average live tv audience was just over a million people and the most watched games all featured big sides playing each other , such as @entity0 v @entity36 ( 2.704 million ) and @entity1 versus @entity37 ( 2.462m )			2
the least watched games were @entity69 v @entity67 ( 251,000 ) and @entity72 v @entity70 ( 281,000 )			0
how the money was actually distributed ... how the money would have been distributed according to audience ... entertaining : @entity0 were on tv 28 times last season and their games received almost 37 million viewers the ‘ big ’ clubs like @entity0 and @entity1 attract much bigger audiences than the ‘ smaller ’ clubs and , hence , are televised live more often			2
after adding up the total amount of viewers for each club , we divided the ‘ equal share ’ of the @entity4 money proportionately according to those viewers			0
@entity0 , for example , with almost 37 million people watching their games , were awarded £ 148.9m for their viewing share in addition to the £ 23.5m their received for finishing second , a total of more than £ 172m			0
cashing in : @entity39 received over £ 37m more than they would have done according to their viewers raking it in : @entity96 and @entity97 dominate the tv money in the @entity100 league @entity39 , on the other hand , with just 5.8m viewers all season , were awarded £ 23.6m plus the £ 2.5m they were given for a 19th - placed finish , a total of just over £ 26m			1
some people would argue that @entity0 get more viewers because they are on tv many more times than ‘ smaller ’ clubs like @entity39			0
and they were on the box a lot more : 28 lives games for @entity0 against eight for @entity39			0
but then @entity0 ’s average audience per game was almost twice that of @entity39			0
the way the @entity4 ’s money is distributed is one example of its relative fairness			0
the big clubs get much less than they arguably deserve based on popularity , but sharing the money more fairly adds to the competitiveness of the league			0
in nations where clubs negotiate their own tv deals , the big clubs monopolise nearly all the cash , as is the case in @entity100 with @entity96 and @entity97 .			2

based on @entity133 study , top clubs in @entity135 missed out on tens of millions *due* to @entity4 's tv money distribution system
if television revenue was distributed more according to audience , @entity0 would have received £ 172.3m , £ 74.8m more than they actually got ( £ 97.5m )
@entity1 collected £ 89.1m , but would have got £ 159.5m
@entity4 give each club basic tv payment of £ 52.2m
rest of £ 1.56bn pot distributed based on final position and tv appearances
@entity100 league tv money distributed very *heavily* towards @entity97 and @entity96 as they negotiate their own deals
