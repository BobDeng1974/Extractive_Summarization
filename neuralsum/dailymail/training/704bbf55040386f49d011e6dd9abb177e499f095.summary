@entity0 victim : @entity3 finance consultant @entity2 , who died in @entity4 , with daughter @entity5 @entity7 airports and airlines are on high alert to prevent the deadly ebola virus from reaching this country			1
passengers thought to have the virus will be barred from boarding flights heading to the @entity7 – and will be held at immigration if they appear ill on arrival			1
they will then be quarantined in highly secure isolation units , such as those at the @entity19 in @entity20			0
but because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear , there are fears some victims will slip through the net			0
doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from @entity31 are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu - like symptoms			1
one of the deadliest diseases known to man , @entity0 has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst - ever outbreak			1
for the first time , the virus , which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims , has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities , raising fears it will arrive in @entity7 on an international flight			1
it can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure			1
foreign secretary @entity53 , who chaired a meeting of the government ’s @entity56 emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday , said @entity0 was a ‘ very serious threat ’			1
but he sought to calm fears , saying it ‘ most unlikely ’ that @entity0 could spread within the @entity7 because of ‘ frankly different ’ standards of infection control here			1
’ health secretary @entity77 said the @entity78 was looking at its capability and taking ‘ precautionary measures ’ but he was ‘ very confident ’ it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the @entity7			1
in other developments : the outbreak started in @entity85 in february and spread to neighbouring @entity68 and @entity86 within weeks			2
explanation : a @entity65 medical staff worker demonstrates personal protective equipment to educate team members on the ebola virus in @entity68 but international concern has been inflamed by the death of an @entity3 finance consultant in the @entity4 city of @entity96 , @entity31 ’s biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub			2
' precautionary measures ' : health secretary @entity77 ( pictured yesterday ) is ' very confident ' the @entity78 will be able to cope if @entity0 arrived in the @entity7 @entity2 , 40 , had been on his way back to the @entity3 after attending the funeral of his sister in @entity68			1
she had also died from the disease			0
@entity105 flies daily to @entity96 and also has regular flights to @entity107 in @entity86 and @entity108 in @entity68			0
staff at all airlines have the discretion to deny boarding			0
a @entity105 spokesman said : ‘ the safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority			0
‘ we will fully comply with the guidance provided by local health authorities and continue to monitor the situation closely			1
’ @entity123 said its staff had been trained to spot symptoms , which range from flu - like fever and malaise initially , to vomiting , diarrhoea and , eventually , bleeding from the eyes , ears , nose and mouth			2
sufferers can experience convulsions and fall into a coma before dying from massive and irreparable damage to their internal organs			0
it was unclear last night to what extent the @entity7 would follow the practice of some countries and track down and quarantine all passengers on a plane used by a suspected sufferer			2
but the tone of the latest official guidance suggested only those known to be in close physical proximity – five rows of seats surrounding the suspect – will be contacted for checks			0
dr @entity153 , director of global health at @entity155 , insisted that airline passengers had little to fear , as direct contact with bodily fluids is needed for the disease to spread			1
huge problem : one of the deadliest diseases known to man , @entity0 has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst - ever outbreak but he admitted that ‘ it is not impossible ’ that someone who is infected could arrive in the @entity7 before developing any symptoms			1
' the @entity7 has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here ' @entity172 @entity173 said it had a medical team on constant duty with the power to detain , isolate or send to hospital people with suspicious symptoms			1
dr @entity179 , a @entity180 expert on disease spread , said : ‘ there is no treatment – nothing you can do yourself			2
it ’s in the lap of the gods if you ’re lucky to be one of the few who survive			2
’ dr @entity191 , a @entity192 virologist , said @entity0 will come here eventually – but predicted it will be caught and shut down by border staff			2
taking no chances : health workers in protective gear carry a victim of the @entity0 outbreak in @entity199 , @entity68 the @entity172 sought to play down the likelihood of an outbreak in the @entity7 , saying the government ‘ is confident the @entity7 has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here ’			1
' there is no treatment – nothing you can do yourself			0
it ’s in the lap of the gods if you ’re lucky to be one of the few who survive ' dr @entity179 , disease expert it added : ‘ we have experienced scientists and doctors – the @entity221 , the @entity222 and the @entity223 – and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases			1
the risk of this disease spreading fast in the @entity7 is much lower because of that			1
’ @entity68 has closed all its schools , quarantined a number of communities and placed all non-essential workers on compulsory leave as part of an action plan that will be enforced by security			2
officials said hospitals were overwhelmed , an isolation unit in the capital @entity108 was over-run and patients were being treated in their homes			0
information minister @entity244 said : ‘ this is a major public health emergency			1
’ what is @entity0 ? @entity0 is a virus that causes a potentially lethal illness called hemorrhagic fever			1
this makes the body ’s blood vessels porous and they start to leak , causing catastrophic internal bleeding			0
up to nine out of ten people who contract the virus will die without immediate medical attention			0
the virus emerged in 1976 in an isolated village near the @entity258 in the @entity259			0
why is the government suddenly worried ? foreign secretary @entity53 chaired an emergency cobra meeting on the issue yesterday because there are growing fears that the virus could enter @entity7 from @entity31			1
the latest outbreak in @entity31 is the worst on record – killing more than 670 people – and is also the first to affect people in cities and not just remote villages			1
in @entity85 , the epidemic has reached the capital , @entity274			0
what are the symptoms ? dr @entity277 of the @entity278 , who has treated victims in @entity85 and @entity86 , says : ‘ the initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu - like illness			2
they include fever , headache and lethargy			0
this progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting			0
’ the incubation period for the virus varies from two days to three weeks			2
have there been any cases in @entity7 ? no. but dr @entity191 , a virologist from the @entity192 who studies viruses such as @entity0 , warns that it is statistically likely the virus will eventually come to the @entity7			1
the most immediate danger is that the virus will enter @entity7 on an airline flight			2
one victim , @entity3 @entity2 , had symptoms of the virus in @entity68 but was allowed to board multiple international flights			0
vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea , he flew from @entity68 , stopped over in @entity303 , changed planes in @entity305 and died in @entity4			0
what is the connection with bush meat ? @entity310 meat refers to any meat obtained from wild animals killed in rainforests			0
it is thought humans can contract @entity0 from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees , fruit bats , forest antelopes and porcupines			1
there are fears that smuggled bush meat might be a route for the virus into @entity7 – 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters the country every year , and 55 per cent is said to be bush meat , which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets			2
how contagious is it ? it is less contagious than other diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis , which can spread for considerable distances through the air			0
dr @entity277 said : ‘ @entity0 does not spread through the air			2
to contract it , you must have contact with an infected person ’s blood or other bodily fluids , so the real risk is to family members and care givers			0
’ should i worry ? ‘ the risk of anyone in @entity7 contracting @entity0 is very small , ’ stresses dr @entity350 , an expert in viral infection , who is the director of the newly established @entity352			1
he adds : ‘ if the outbreak in @entity31 is not brought under control , then that would increase the risk to people here			1
’ what if i think i have been in contact with an infected person ? contact your gp immediately , although the health authorities are keen to avoid everyone who has flown from @entity31 rushing to their family doctor because it will overwhelm surgeries			1
if a passenger on a flight is identified as being infected with the virus , every other passenger on that flight will be contacted			0
how can the disease be treated ? there is no cure for @entity0 , although scientists across the world are working to develop treatments such as antiviral drugs			2
other scientific teams are carrying out studies on antibodies – the body ’s immune defence cells – from people who have recovered from the infection and have antibodies in their bodies that may neutralise the virus			0
‘ many people do survive , ’ says dr @entity277			0
‘ treatment with drugs such as antibiotics and fluids given through intravenous drips can make a great difference			0
loss of fluids is often a killer in @entity0 cases			0
up to half of patients can survive , if treated properly			0

passengers thought to have virus to be barred from taking flights to @entity7
will be held at immigration if they appear ill on arrival and quarantined
@entity0 has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst - ever outbreak
@entity417 kills up to 90 *%* of victims and has spread to large towns and cities
can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure
the @entity172 said it had not advised against travel to affected areas , but it was monitoring the situation closely .
experts said the survival of anyone who catches the disease was ‘ in the lap of the gods ’ .
@entity155 said the outbreak was ‘ clearly not yet under control ’ and was the most ‘ acute health emergency ’ facing @entity7 .
a *charity* warned that the outbreak was ‘ speeding up rather than *slowing* down ’ and the @entity444 *pledged* *£* *1.6million* to stopping it spreading .
there was speculation the @entity449 will be called to *repatriate* any infected @entity7 from @entity31 .
