sergeant @entity23 was about to set up a rolling roadblock when @entity6 arrived , slowing down before colliding with the police car , bringing the @entity26 to a stop			1
the video shows @entity38 driving the correct way along the motorway when a pair of headlights appear on the horizon - on the wrong side of the central reservation			1
the brave officer slows down , quickly positioning himself in front of @entity6 's vehicle before carefully shunting the car , bringing it to a halt			2
with @entity6 seemingly unaware of what has happened , @entity38 runs from the police car and drags the offender out of the car			1
the video shows @entity38 dashing out of his vehicle and dragging @entity6 from the car @entity6 was later arrested and was today jailed for eight months for dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen			1
he was also disqualified from driving for three years meanwhile other officers put a road block on the carriageway to reduce further risk of a collision and @entity6 was later arrested on suspicion of drink driving and dangerous driving			1
as well as being disqualified from driving for three years , @entity6 will also have to take an extended driving test before being able to get behind the wheel again			2
@entity38 said : ' despite the time of night there was still fast - moving traffic on the motorway and the darkness meant drivers had minimal time to avoid the oncoming vehicle			0
' i would like to take this opportunity to thank the many witnesses who came forward to provide evidence in this case			0
it is clear that a number of drivers were left in genuine fear for their lives after describing how @entity6 only missed them by inches			0
' @entity6 is extremely lucky that he did not cause a serious collision that could have resulted in people getting killed or seriously injured			0
at the time he had no regard for how much danger he was in			0
' sentencing @entity6 at @entity91 @entity90 , judge @entity89 commended @entity38 for his ' significant and brave actions in bringing [ @entity6 ] to a stop '			2
inspector @entity94 said : ' in some circumstances and always as a last resort when there is an immediate risk to life – as was the case in this incident – the only way to stop a dangerous driver is to put a physical barrier in their way			2
' in this case i am certain that the actions of @entity38 and other road policing officers on that night were all that stopped a serious collision from happening			0
' the driver was removed from his car for his own safety			0
given where the cars were stopped – the fast lane of a motorway – it was imperative that officers acted quickly to arrest him and remove the danger to the public , to themselves and to @entity6 himself			2
' i hope video footage brings home some of the dangers present on our roads and the lengths police officers will go to keep them safe for everybody			0
