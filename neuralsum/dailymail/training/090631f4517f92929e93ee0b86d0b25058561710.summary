by @entity0 published : 20:13 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 7 august 2013 the country 's longest - serving policeman who is retiring after almost 50 years has spoken about how the job has changed since he first started as a bobby on the beat			1
@entity7 @entity6 , 66 , described how modern officers have to do twice the amount of work because of paperwork and crime is only down because people have problems reporting it			1
although he has had ' the most fantastic career ' , @entity16 expressed frustration at how advances in technology have led to officers having to spend more time ensuring information is electronically filed			1
i do n't actually work in a police station obviously any longer			1
' i work at the @entity36 on security , so i do n't get as much work as they do			1
' from what i gather , yes it is the case , because i 've tried to report crimes myself like any other citizen and it 's a little more difficult than it used to be			2
" oh yes , could you call in ? or could you send us an email ? "			2
' i 'm a policeman , i want to report it to a police officer , basically			2
and i think that is one of the reasons recently crime has gone down			1
people wo n't report it			1
but that 's another issue			2
' @entity28 , from @entity58 , @entity26 , joined the police in 1966 after his father persuaded him to apply			2
he added that in the past officers would write and submit a report and do additional paperwork if needed , whereas now more time is taken up with ensuring all admin is completed electronically			1
he said : ' it 's changed so much			2
it 's changed our whole job			2
' the country 's longest - serving police officer said officers today have to do ' more or less twice the work ' due to increased admin he added : ' but we have to do more or less twice the work , because you do your paperwork , and then you 've got to scan it in to the electronic side , because everything 's now saved and dealt with electronically			1
' when asked if he felt any sympathy for young people coming into the job now , @entity28 said : ' yeah i will because it 's a totally different job to when i joined in regarding the circumstances of the regulations and such			1
' @entity28 said technology has changed the job of policing he added : ' for the young kids it 's quite difficult			1
' @entity28 also said that while people are still as violent as they were in the past , the public expects police officers to ' behave in a different manner ' now			1
when asked if police officers today have to be more careful and cautious when on the job , he said : ' well most certainly , they have to , yeah			1
that 's just the way the public expects us to behave in a different manner			2
' i mean the people have n't changed			1
they 're still as violent in some cases as they were then , but we have to approach it in a different manner , and of course we do , and our training is based towards that			0
' @entity28 looks back on his earlier years playing sport with fondness and counts it as one of the highlights of his career			0
he said : ' we were always allowed to do sports			0
no longer the case , we do n't have enough personnel to do it so we do n't do it any longer			0
' but i was playing football and i boxed for the police , and i played football and did cross-country running , all in the job time , because we were the @entity135			1
' we 're now the service , and as soon as we became the service it did change			0
we do n't really run football teams at police stations any longer , because they 're required on the streets because their numbers came down and our requirement was further on			0
' despite the changes he has witnessed throughout his career , @entity28 , who has arrested thousands of criminals , said : ' i 've had a great time			0
' he recalled one arrest which left him fearing for his life which involved a man with a hand grenade who threatened to pull the pin			0
the officer ripped the grenade from the man before throwing it into open space			0
although he feared for his life , he said it is not until after that sort of scenario is over that you realise the danger you were in , and ' that 's what police do ' , he said			0
' you do n't think it at the time			0
at the time you just deal with it			0
we get ourselves into trouble			0
' health and safety probably dislike us intently			0
you just react to a situation and do what you think is needed , ' he said			0
reflecting on what he will miss most about his career , he said : ' people - the amount of people i speak to on a daily basis , the amount of comrades i 've got at work			1
' @entity28 , who is married with two children , is looking forward to enjoying more travel in his retirement .			0
