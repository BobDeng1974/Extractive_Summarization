@entity1 scientists have made a breakthrough in treating one of @entity1 ’s most deadly cancers			1
when patients with bladder tumours that were thought to be untreatable were given a new drug , many of their tumours shrank and in some cases disappeared completely			1
in some cases the cancer disappeared completely			1
one man is still free of the disease , a year after starting treatment			0
chemotherapy produces debilitating side - effects but in contrast the new drug produced ‘ striking ’ results and has few side - effects bladder cancer is @entity1 ’s seventh most common cancer , but research into it has been largely neglected and there have been no new treatments for 30 years			1
it is also one of the biggest cancer killers , with more than 5,000 deaths a year – or 14 a day			1
one in ten cases are not spotted until the disease has spread from the bladder to another part of the body and these patients tend to only live for 12 to 18 months after diagnosis			1
with chemotherapy having limited benefit but producing debilitating side - effects , many patients decide to forgo it in favour of making the most of their remaining months			0
others are too elderly or too ill to cope with the toxic cocktail of drugs used			0
in contrast , the new drug produced ‘ striking ’ results and has few side - effects , the journal @entity48 reports			0
researcher @entity52 , of @entity53 , said the new drug ‘ revolutionised ’ the lives of patients in a trial			2
many bladder tumours have a protein that switches off the immune system			1
the new drug , known only as @entity61 , turns the immune system back on – which then attacks the cancer			1
in a trial at @entity66 in @entity67 involving patients with supposedly untreatable cancer , the drug shrank tumours in more than half of those with the protein			1
surprisingly , it also helped some of the patients whose tumours did n’t have the protein , the journal @entity48 reports			2
dr @entity52 , of @entity53 , said : ‘ we have had people who have been told to go away because there are not treatment options for them and the cancer has completely disappeared or reduced in size			1
the drug , which has few side effects , is unlikely to be available until the ongoing trial stage is completed			0
a second , larger , trial has just finished and a third is about to begin			0
it shows promise for fighting a range of other cancers , including bowel and skin cancers			0
professor @entity94 , of @entity95 , said : ' it ’s really good to find a new treatment for a type of cancer that we ’ve been struggling to make progress with for many years ’ however , the drugs watchdog in the @entity103 was so impressed by @entity105 ’ results that it may not wait for all the results before giving the go ahead for the drug ’s use			2
@entity110 authorities are likely to want all the data before approving it , meaning it is several years from the market here			0
the medicine , which is given through a drip every three weeks , is being developed by @entity117 , the @entity118 firm behind breast cancer ‘ wonder drug ’ @entity120			2
it shows promise against a range of other cancers , including bowel and skin cancer , but seems to work best on the bladder			2
professor @entity94 , of @entity95 , said : ‘ @entity95 can only grow by finding a way to escape detection by the immune system			0
one way it does this is to trigger a shut - off switch on immune cells when they get close to the tumour			0
‘ this new treatment blocks the cancer cell ’s ability to use this switch , allowing the immune system to recognise and destroy the cancer			2
‘ it ’s really good to find a new treatment for a type of cancer that we ’ve been struggling to make progress with for many years			0

patients with ' untreatable ' bladder tumours were given new drug
many tumours shrank and in some cases disappeared completely
bladder cancer is @entity1 ’s seventh most common cancer
it *'s* one of the biggest killers with more than 5,000 deaths a year – 14 a day
