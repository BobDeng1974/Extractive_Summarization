for more than a century , various doctors have put forward the idea women are capable of having two different types of orgasm - clitoral and vaginal			1
in particular , the differences between what the two types are , as well as the reasons why , have been heavily debated			0
in a bid to get a definitive answer , @entity10 gynaecologists used sonography machines to measure tiny changes in blood flow during external and internal stimulation			1
the research revealed external clitoral stimulation does not involve the internal root of the clitoris , but , vaginal stimulation does involve both the root and the external clitoris - suggesting the two - orgasm theory may be true			1
gynaecologists tested the two - orgasm theory using sonography machines			1
they found external stimulation was not involved with the root of the clitoris , but , vaginal stimulation involved both the root and external clitoris			1
this suggests different types of stimulation create different sensations , stock image pictured during the tests , researchers @entity33 and @entity35 connected three women to sonography machines			1
these machines were used to visualise the movements of the clitorourethrovaginal ( @entity42 ) complex - the system of clitoral nerves - during both external , direct stimulation of the clitoris , and vaginal stimulation			2
these measurements were taken use flat and vaginal probes during manual self - stimulation of the external clitoris , and during vaginal penetration with a wet tampon			1
as the women stimulated themselves , the researchers used the probes to measure tiny changes in the flow of blood in the area using pulses known as the @entity63 signal			1
the belief that females experience two types of orgasm - clitoral and vaginal - is known as the ' two - orgasm theory			2
' it was first suggested by @entity70 ( pictured right ) in 1905 in his @entity71			0
@entity70 argued clitoral orgasm was an ' adolescent phenomenon ' , and as women mature and reach puberty , this changes to vaginal orgasm			0
@entity70 did n't provide any evidence for his theory and they have been heavily criticised and debated ever since			0
it is not to be confused with multiple and sequential orgasms			0
women can experience more than one orgasm during sex or masturbation			0
multiple orgasms are orgasms that occur one after the other , almost immediately			0
@entity88 means orgasms that occur in sequence , but usually minutes apart			0
the sonography machines and probes , stock image pictured , were used to visualise movements of the clitorourethrovaginal ( @entity42 ) complex - the system of clitoral nerves - and blood flow this revealed external clitoral stimulation did not involve the internal root of the clitoris , but , vaginal stimulation involved both the root and the external clitoris			1
this affected the flow of blood and therefore was linked to the difference in sensation			0
@entity33 and @entity35 said : ' the scans obtained during external stimulation and vaginal penetration demonstrated the root of the clitoris is not involved with external clitoral stimulation			1
in contrast , during vaginal stimulation - because of the movements and displacements - the whole @entity42 complex and the clitoral roots in particular were involved			2
this shows ' functional differences depending on the type of stimulation , ' explained the researchers			0
while ' the [ @entity63 ] signal indicating flow speed in the veins mirrored these anatomical changes			0
' the researchers concluded that based on these findings , the different reported perceptions from these two types stimulation can be explained by the different parts of the clitoris			2
the researchers concluded that based on their findings , the different reported perceptions from the two types stimulation can be explained by the different parts of the clitoris , highlighted			2

previous research suggested clitoral orgasms differ from vaginal arousal
@entity10 gynaecologists tested this theory using sonography machines
each *participant* *'s* clitoris was externally and internally stimulated
they measured the flow of blood using what *â€™s* called the @entity63 signal
external stimulation was not involved with the internal root of the clitoris
however , penetration involved both the root and the external clitoris
researchers conclude the different feelings caused by these two types of orgasm can be explained by the different parts
