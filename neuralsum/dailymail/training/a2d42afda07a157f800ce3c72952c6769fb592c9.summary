by @entity0 last updated at 1:16 pm on 20th june 2011 @entity1 has died during treatment for lung cancer an anti-war campaigner who spent ten years camped outside the houses of @entity6 has died of lung cancer			1
@entity1 , 62 , set up his ramshackle site in june 2001 as a one - man protest against @entity11 military action in @entity12 and , later , @entity13			1
he became a familiar face to mps and a hero to civil rights campaigners , but his tent and collection of horrific pictures of war victims , accompanied by slogans such as ‘ baby killers ’ , offended many			1
but mr @entity1 and his followers fought off all legal attempts to remove the camp from @entity27 , although he was limited in the hours he could use a megaphone to attack government policies			1
it began as a response to economic sanctions and @entity11 and @entity34 bombing raids on @entity12 , but his angry messages daubed on hand - written posters grew after the invasion of @entity13 and @entity12			1
this month he marked ten years living on the square			1
the protester died in @entity40 on saturday where he had been receiving treatment			1
yesterday his devastated family paid tribute to the father of seven , releasing this statement : ‘ it is with deepest regret that i inform you that our father , @entity49 , passed away this morning			1
persistent protest : mr @entity1 kept up his campaign for more than a decade , marking the tenth anniversary of his camp just three weeks ago @entity56 attempts to move @entity1 frim his makeshift camp failed afterthe high court said it would be a breach of his human rights			1
in 2002 , @entity61 tried to prosecute mr @entity1 for causing an obstruction , but the case was thrown out after it was ruled that camp banners did not impede the public			1
and even when politicians amended the law to outlaw unlicensed protests , mr @entity1 was able to keep up his campaign thanks to a legal loophole			2
in the 2005 general election mr @entity1 stood as a candidate in the @entity73 in order to further his campaign			2
he won 298 votes , making a speech against the ongoing presence of @entity11 troops in @entity12 at the declaration of the result			1
last year , bailiffs moved on a number of other protest groups from @entity84 , but again mr @entity1 escaped eviction because he was camped on the pavement , not the lawn			2
he was also arrested last year when police carried out security sweeps in the area ahead of the @entity91			2
and in april mr @entity1 faced another battle when officials tried to evict the huddle of tents , tarpaulin and placards - described by some as ' an eyesore ' - ahead of the wedding of prince @entity101 and @entity102 at nearby @entity103			2
‘ as you know he was battling lung cancer , and was having treatment in @entity40			1
‘ he left us in his sleep and in no pain , after a long , hard fight			1
’ supporters and mps flocked to @entity113 to pay tribute			2
the speaker ’s wife , @entity115 posted a number of @entity118 , saying : ‘ sad to hear @entity1 has died			2
‘ his peace camp in @entity120 was a good thing ( in my humble opinion -- many here would beg to differ )			2
’ she added : ‘ @entity125 might put up a blue plaque : @entity1 , peace campaigner , lived here 2001 - 2011			1
’ @entity1 was the son of a soldier who was one of the first to enter the @entity129 concentration camp after it was liberated from the @entity130			2
@entity1 spent time in the merchant navy and worked as a carpenter , but his evangelical @entity134 faith drove him to seek out suffering			0
he visited @entity135 during the @entity136 and travelled to the killing fields of @entity138			0
@entity1 also worked with troubled youngsters in @entity140 , @entity141 where he lived with his wife @entity142 and their seven children			0
@entity1 told journalists that he had left his family to campaign for other families suffering in war zones			0
‘ i want to go back to my own kids and look them in the face again , knowing that i ’ve done all i can to try and save the children of @entity12 and other countries who are dying because of my @entity153 ’s unjust , amoral , fear - and money - driven policies , ’ he said			0
anti-establishment : mr @entity1 's political position often led to run - ins with the law ‘ these children and people of other countries are every bit as valuable and worthy of love as my precious wife and children			0
’ in his long fight against the government , @entity1 became a beacon for civil rights campaigners			1
in april 2002 @entity61 began legal action to remove him under the @entity170 , but the case never came to court			0
the council later limited the hours he could use a megaphone to attack @entity153 policies			0
in 2005 the @entity176 restricted the right to protest in designated areas within 1km of the @entity179 but the @entity180 ruled that @entity1 could apply to the police for permission to continue his demonstration			0
high - profile support : although many politicians condemned mr @entity1 's tactics , he did win the backing of veteran @entity189 mp @entity188 ( left ) this was granted - but only with a series of conditions limiting the size of his protest site			1
in 2006 police seized 90 per cent of @entity198 ’s placards overnight on the grounds that he had breached these restrictions			0
however , a judge later found that there was no case to answer			0
this year the @entity204 successfully got permission to evict @entity1 from the grass area at the centre of @entity27			0
@entity125 is due later this year to go to court to try to get the demonstrators moved off the pavement too			0
his protest was immortalised in january 2007 when former @entity213 nominee @entity212 recreated his camp at the @entity216 gallery			0
@entity1 also won a @entity218 award for @entity219 in 2007			0
determined : mr @entity1 pictured in the early days of his one - man campaign yesterday his collection of bleak war photos remained untouched			0
fellow members of the @entity224 said his legal battles had taken a toll on his health			0
they released this statement : ‘ @entity49 showed great determination and courage during the many long hard years he led his @entity224 in @entity27 , during which it is well documented that he was relentlessly persecuted by the authorities which eventually took its toll on his health			1
‘ @entity6 , the police , and courts etc , should forever be ashamed of their disgraceful behaviour towards @entity49			0
