by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 16:01 est , 15 october 2012 thousands of employees at companies owned by billionaire @entity4 fundraisers were told to vote for @entity5 in packet mailed to them warning of the dangers of an @entity11 re-election			1
the mailer is easily traced back to @entity13 and @entity14 , the notorious multi-billionaire brothers who have largely financed the @entity17 movement and served as effective @entity5 bundlers			1
in these @entity19 released excerpts from a letter sent to 45,000 employees at @entity23 - a @entity14 - owned paper company based in @entity24 - that was signed by the company 's ceo @entity25			1
this is the third time in the past week that the head of a major corporation sent out a letter pressuring employees to vote for @entity5 in the upcoming election			2
it goes on to say that the dangers that loom with the wrong presidency would include ' unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses ' and threaten ' many of our more than 50,000 @entity48 employees and contractors may suffer the consequences , including higher gasoline prices , runaway inflation , and other ills '			2
the excerpts from the letter show that while the ceo never explicitly said that @entity11 would be the one to cause said ills , the point is made very clear by the inclusion of a list of @entity14 - supported candidates			1
needless to say , @entity11 did not make the list			1
the letter says that the list comes at the request of ' many employees ' who wanted to know what state and local politicians are supported by ' @entity14 companies or by @entity77 , our employee political action committee '			1
famous friends : @entity5 is seen shaking @entity36 's ( tallest on left ) hand at the @entity82 the full text of the letter - and of the supporting list - were not made public by @entity86 , but the site reports that in addition to @entity5 , 14 other @entity4 state politicians were highlighted			1
though the cover letter was signed by mr @entity25 , the driving force was explicitly clear : an @entity91 editorial penned by @entity14 and a @entity93 editorial by his brother @entity13 were included in the packets			1
while we are typically told before each presidential election that it is important and historic , i believe the upcoming election will determine what kind of @entity48 future generations will inherit			2
if we elect candidates who want to spend hundreds of billions in borrowed money on costly new subsidies for a few favored cronies , put unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses , prevent or delay important new construction projects , and excessively hinder free trade , then many of our more than 50,000 @entity48 employees and contractors may suffer the consequences , including higher gasoline prices , runaway inflation , and other ills			0
at the request of many employees , we have also provided a list of candidates in your state that have been supported by @entity14 companies or by @entity77 , our employee political action committee			1
we believe any decision about which candidates to support is — as always — yours and yours alone , based on the factors that are most important to you			0
second , we do not support candidates based on their political affiliation			0
exerting such pressure on employees was not always legal , but recent @entity137 decisions no longer prohibit companies from telling their employees who to vote for			0
for appearances sake , however , the letter did include one line gesturing towards partiality : ' we believe any decision about which candidates to support is — as always — yours and yours alone , based on the factors that are most important to you			2
' @entity151 employees are likely familiar with the move , as workers at the same @entity23 plant received a similar packet two years ago during the midterm elections			2
at the time , then - @entity157 mr @entity25 wrote that ' as @entity14 company employees , we have a lot at stake in the upcoming election '			1
the letter was published in its entirety by @entity164 and one of the sheets included voter registration deadline information and also a list of all @entity14 - supported politicians			1
on the list of 19 candidates , all but four were @entity4			1
one current employee who received the packet said that it is just one of the ways that the @entity14 brothers are exerting undue influence on their workers			1
' they are destroying the planet			0
they are trying to buy the votes			0
they think they are so high and mighty			0
they just think their way is the only way and they think everyone else is wrong , ' the man told in these @entity19			0
he spoke anonymously for fear of being fired			0
' if you do n't believe in their philosophy , you can find a job somewhere else			0
i have worked there for 30 - plus years			2
i have no training ; i have worked in a factory			0
what am i going to do ? ' this is the third time in a week where an influential ceo warned his employees about the prospect of an @entity11 win come november			1
@entity209 published the letter written by @entity212 owner @entity211 where he clearly said that if @entity5 won the presidential election , they would be more likely to keep their jobs			2
well financed : @entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) , seen here in 1970 , are now ranked as the fourth and fifth wealthiest @entity48 respectively with personal net worth of $ 31billion ' the economy does n't currently pose a threat to your job			1
what does threaten your job however , is another 4 years of the same presidential administration			0
of course , as your employer , i ca n't tell you whom to vote for , and i certainly would n't interfere with your right to vote for whomever you choose , ' he wrote			0
prosperity : @entity36 , pictured , and his brother were major funders of the @entity233 , a group that helped finance republicans in the 2010 midterm elections @entity237 's @entity236 reported that @entity238 , the ceo of @entity240 - based @entity239 , sent an email to more than 1,000 employees saying that the company needs a new administration to remain ' independent ' in order to keep from cutting costs and firing employees			2
' i can tell you , if the @entity48 re-elects president @entity11 , our chances of staying independent are slim to none , ' he wrote			1
' if we fail as a nation to make the right choice on november 6th , and we lose our independence as a company , i do n't want to hear any complaints regarding the fallout that will most likely come			0
' when it comes to the @entity260 , the brothers prefer to remain behind the curtain rather than in the spotlight			0
as a result , no members of the press were invited to their seaside $ 50,000 - per - plate fundraiser for @entity5 in their @entity268 home this july			2
there was a brief break in that privacy lately , however , as their other brother @entity272 now faces a lawsuit after he allegedly held a former employee hostage for two days			0
ranked fourth and fifth respectively on @entity276 ' list of the richest @entity48 , @entity14 and @entity36 made their money in industrial markets			1
their company - @entity151 - is the second largest privately held company in the country with 67,000 employees			2
@entity282 : @entity36 , pictured in 1996 @entity14 , 76 , and @entity13 , 72 , are both worth an estimated $ 31billion and are jointly ranked as the 45th most powerful people in the world			1
known for their political connections to @entity4 groups that support lightened regulation and free markets , @entity14 is thought to donate more than $ 40million per year to his libertarian foundation			1
while many political analysts have understood their power for years , the pair made their biggest foray on the public stage when they helped to found the political advocacy group @entity233 , which played a significant role in the @entity4 takeover of the @entity300 in 2010 and the surge of the @entity17 movement			1
they have focused their attention to specific political campaigns in the past and had successful results			0
the clearest of those successes was the gubernatorial campaign of union - busting governor @entity310 in @entity311			2
though the pair are famous for the secretive way in which they do business , their name has become something of a stereotype when it comes to labelling the questionable connections between private enterprise and public works			0
' the @entity14 brothers are the poster children of the effort by multinational corporate @entity48 to try to redefine the rights and values of @entity48 citizens , ' @entity325 @entity311 representative @entity324 told @entity19			1
@entity331 took notice of the @entity14 ’s public perception , and a shady pair of billionaire brothers ( the ‘ @entity337 brothers ’ ) were made the villains in @entity339 , a comedy starring @entity340 and @entity341			1
making the point more clear , mr @entity340 was asked about the @entity260 during the press tour for the film , and he said : ‘ i disagree with everything they do			0
they are creepy and there is no way around that			0
it 's not freedom what they are doing			0
’ in turn , the @entity14 press representative responded by taking a shot at the @entity363 star ’s career : ‘ last we checked , the movie is a comedy			2
maybe more to the point is that it 's laughable to take political guidance or moral instruction from a guy who makes obscene gestures with a monkey on a bus in @entity372			0
’ raising the alarm : the @entity260 have served as the silent financial partners of many @entity17 groups			0

@entity13 and @entity14 are well - known @entity4 supporters
