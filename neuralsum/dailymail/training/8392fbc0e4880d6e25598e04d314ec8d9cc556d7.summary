much like finding a flattering pair of jeans , mascara is something we spend our whole lives trying to get right			1
but with new formulations and wand shapes promising everything from a false lash effect to a 360 - degree curl , it ’s hard to know which one is best for you			1
here , @entity14 tests the new @entity15 and high - end mascaras			1
dramatic definition @entity18 created the mascara wand in 1958 and its new @entity20 , £ 9.99 , has a slim , flexible wand with narrow bristles to coat each lash from root to tip. it clumps slightly at the root so takes a couple of coats to fan out my lashes , but the extra effort is worth it			1
i look as if i am wearing eyeliner because of the volume it creates			1
this mascara makes me look brighter and more awake , and lasts all day without flaking or smudging			1
however , it may be too much for daytime			1
4/5 old favourite the updated formula of this make - up bag favourite , @entity41 , £ 4.99 , in its distinctive green and pink packaging , has a bumper - size brush that promises bigger , more dramatic lashes			1
yes , it gives long , defined lashes that take only seconds to achieve , but it ’s not particularly volumising			2
the colour is jet black and clump - free , and it is a bargain price			1
however , this mascara does flake as the day goes on , and proves stubborn to remove			2
3/5 @entity53 @entity56 @entity55 @entity54 , £ 21 , has tiny fibres that are said to plump lashes and a chunky , tapered wand designed to thicken and define			2
it creates , soft , feathery lashes as @entity63 layer it on			2
it looks as though i have more lashes , rather than simply thicker ones			2
i received lots of compliments when wearing this mascara — even from my husband ! — and it lasted all day			2
5/5 @entity75 and natural the latest @entity78 mascara , @entity79 , £ 10.99 , promises to give you flexible lashes			2
yes , the rounded , large wand leaves my lashes strikingly longer , but it is clumpy			0
i love the intense black colour , which is also slightly glossy , giving a luxurious look			0
however , it is n’t as volumising as i expected			0
the brush is tricky to manage — i end up with blobs of mascara around my eyes			0
however , it ’s brilliant at emphasising lower lashes , gives a pretty natural look rather than a high glamour one and lasts all day			0
3½/5 @entity96 @entity97 , £ 19 , is a make - up artist favourite , but it does n’t have the dramatic effect i was expecting			1
though my top lashes certainly look separated and fluffy , it clumps on my bottom lashes — i look as if i ’m going to a @entity106 fancy dress party			0
though it stays in place all day without smudging , and glides off when i remove , it does n’t live up to its false lash name			0
1/5 @entity110 with an oddly shaped curved brush , which dips in the middle to catch inner lashes and curl outer ones , @entity115 ’ @entity116 , £ 6.99 , is designed to give volume and lift to your upper and lower lashes without clumps			0
the lengthening and curling is brilliant , but the volume is nothing to write home about			0
the curl also drops as the day went on , so i need to top it up a few times			0
3/5 doll eyes benefit they ’re real , £ 19.50 , is the best - selling mascara , promising every - thing from length to full - on volume			1
it has a narrow , rubberised brush for zig - zagging between the eyelashes			1
and , wow , it looks as if i ’ve had eyelash extensions — with only two brush strokes i have a super-long , curled , doll - eye effect			1
a few lashes stick together , but the overall effect is inky black and glossy			0
however , it takes a bit of rubbing to shift it at bedtime			0
4½/5 ultimate glamour @entity148 ’s hypnose high glamour mascaras are firm favourites with beauty bloggers			0
the latest version , @entity152 , £ 24.50 , has an unusual , bent ‘ swan neck ’ brush — which i found difficult to use — to lift and fan out lashes			0
it gives a false - lash effect , with instantly longer , thicker and fuller lashes that are jet black and glossy			1
my lower lashes look endless			0
it ’s a bit much if you like a natural look and the thick formula means some lashes stick together			0
it lasts well , with minimal flaking , yet comes off easily with eye make - up remover			1
