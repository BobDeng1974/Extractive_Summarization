@entity0 is likely to come under pressure after he committed to increasing the aid budget despite the money doing little to increase freedoms fast - rising aid spending has done nothing to help the economic and political freedoms of people in the countries which benefit , a new analysis found yesterday			1
it examined the progress of 28 countries which have had a share of the aid financed by @entity18 taxpayers and found that the money ‘ does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries ’			1
it found that twice as many countries lost freedoms after receiving @entity18 aid than improved the political and human rights conditions for their citizens			1
the report produced by the @entity35 ’ @entity36 said : ‘ our current approach to development is not delivering the progress many hoped			0
’ the findings are likely to deepen suspicion of aid spending among @entity40 right - wingers who are unconvinced by @entity0 ’s commitment to increasing the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of gross national income			1
the pledge pushed aid spending close to £ 12billion last year and means further sharp increases over the next few years			1
the prime minister has given his personal support to a @entity51 - backed private member ’s bill which would write the 0.7 per cent target into law – a decision which means mr @entity0 faces the prospect of seeing many of his backbenchers vote against him			0
the new report measured the impact of aid spending against benchmarks laid down by international organisations			1
these included the @entity63 , which assesses how firms are bound by red tape ; the @entity66 , which published a measure of trade and property freedom ; @entity70 , which measures political and civil liberties , and various groups which assess internet and press freedom			0
among 28 countries which received @entity18 aid , 12 showed no effective change at all in their measured levels of freedom over a decade			1
six had a falling score while just three – @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 – had freedom levels that improved with increasing aid			0
among the 28 countries to receive @entity18 aid , 12 showed no effective change on human rights and political freedoms , while six went backwards four countries – @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 – had improved freedom scores even though the amount of aid they received from @entity18 went down			1
@entity100 , which ceased to get @entity18 aid in 2011 , had a falling score			1
@entity104 ’s share of @entity18 aid money went down , and its measured levels of freedom remained little changed			1
the report said : ‘ emergency aid can help prevent famine and limit the spread of disease			0
' health programmes can ensure millions of children in the developing world are vaccinated against serious illness			0
' but the impact of other aid spending , on things like education , infrastructure , governance , capacity building and more , is much harder to measure			2
’ it warned that the amount of money that is spent on aid should not be confused with the effectiveness of the aid programme			0
countries : @entity131 @entity132 @entity133 @entity134 @entity135 @entity136 @entity100 aid spend 2012/13 : £ 265million £ 218million £ 111million £ 85million £ 57million £ 5.6million £ 1.3million ( 2010/11 ) ‘ while international structures and organisations are critical in the global effort to tackle poverty , the iron triangle between the @entity146 , recipient governments and non-governmental organisations must not push donor governments into believing that financial inputs are more important than actual outcomes , ’ the report said			2
a spokesman for the @entity146 said : ‘ @entity18 ’s aid budget is focused on helping developing countries become self - sufficient , stopping the spread of disease and supporting civilians through war and famine			2
‘ but in addition to bearing down on poverty and instability , @entity18 promotes freedom by backing fair elections , a free press and individual rights , and we should be proud of that			2
’ @entity167 , chief executive of the @entity35 ’ @entity36 , said : ‘ with @entity18 ’s public finances in such a horrendous state , it ’s crucial that foreign aid delivers results			2
' too often , @entity18 taxpayers ’ money is spent propping up governments that refuse to grant fundamental freedoms			0
‘ the arbitrary spending target of 0.7 per cent so loved by politicians means that money is spent for the sake of it , rather than for any obvious need			0
' every penny of foreign aid should have one goal - making the lives of ordinary people in developing countries better			0
if it is n’t doing that , it should be stopped			0

@entity0 pledged to increase aid spending sharply in coming years
but report shows it does not encourage political or human freedom
in fact six countries given @entity18 aid went back on human rights ' promises
