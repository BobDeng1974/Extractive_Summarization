' a full investigation is under way into the incident but there is currently no indication of enemy activity being a contributing factor			0
it was the third biggest single loss of @entity2 life since 2001			0
' these deaths are a timely reminder that our troops continue to risk their lives in @entity3 every single day			2
' the red benches were packed as the clerks worked through a series of procedural matters as @entity20 stood at the @entity123 , peers on all sides made a break for the door it meant that she was mid-way through the tributes to six dead forces personnel as peers abandoned their seats but as she spoke began , the majority of around 400 peers who had been listening to other parliamentary business walked out			1
lord @entity25 , who was chief of the general staff from 2006 to 2009 , said : ‘ i am very conscious that what i am about to say may not make me universally popular			1
' i was in command of the @entity10 from 2006 to 2009			0
it will not have escaped the notice of noble @entity6 that this @entity11 was packed to the gunnels at the start of @entity143 for discussion of the @entity145 and other important matters			0
' however , when the minister began to draw attention to those who had fallen , noble lords streamed out of this @entity6 in a way that was most unfortunate , given that six of our comrades had lost their lives			1
' the international development minister ended up addressing a near - empty @entity6 he argued that in future ministers should let all parties know when tributes are being paid to prevent a repeat of the snub			2
' on a military base no one moves during the @entity30			0
in your lordships ’ @entity6 , i respectfully suggest that no one moves while a tribute is being paid to the fallen			0
' the fallen have done their best to give the @entity3 the opportunity of a better life in the future			1
we have done our best ; it is now over to the @entity3 to make the best of what we have given them			2
' @entity178 said : ‘ i left a gap as people were beginning to leave			2
i hoped they would hear what i was saying , but i think some of them did n’t realise			0
‘ i saw people pause and stop and i realise when people were actually hearing what i was saying they were responding			0
but i think you are absolutely right			0
’ lord @entity187 , the @entity189 , said : ‘ when service personnel lose their lives in the line of duty , the custom in the @entity6 is that the defence minister pays tribute to them at the first available opportunity			0
‘ that is exactly what happened on 6 may when tributes were paid by the defence minister to those who had died most recently in @entity3			1
‘ those tributes , echoed by spokesmen for all the parties in the @entity6 , were of course listened to with full respect as is usual			0
‘ @entity207 had not realised that in the statement on 14 may these tributes would be repeated			2
in leaving the @entity11 as is usual after questions , peers therefore intended no disrespect to the memories of those who had died			2
to those who were offended , i apologise on their behalf			0

minister @entity178 began @entity3 statement with tributes to fallen
but dozens of peers made a break for the door , despite sombre mood
*ex-army* chief @entity25 said it was disrespectful to soldiers who died
