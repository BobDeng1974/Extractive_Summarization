it is maths as youʼve never seen in before - transformed into works of art. created by designers @entity6 and @entity8 , the stunning images show the number π , the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter , which is approximately equal to 3.14159			1
however , the pair decided to transform the number into colourful pieces of art. numerology is bogus , but art based on numbers has a beautiful random quality , according to the duo			2
this piece of art shows the progression and transition for the first 1,000 digits of pi designers @entity6 and @entity8 have transformed mathematical numbers , theories and symbols into detailed works of art. @entity33 : progression and transition for the first 10,000 digits of the accidental similarity @entity38 : progression and transition for the first 10,000 digits of φ first @entity6 had the idea of connecting each digit of π to its successive digit with links to the position of the numerically corresponding segments , creating beautiful images similar to the @entity51 toys popular in the 1970s			1
@entity8 added to @entity52 ʽby showing the transition probabilities for each digit across bins of 10 digitsʼ to create a whole series of images using 1,000 and 2,000 digits of pi for their data			1
ʽart based on numbers has a beautiful random quality , ' said @entity8 , who is selling prints of the images via his website			1
first @entity6 had the idea of connecting each digit of pi to its successive digit with links to the position of the numerically corresponding segments , creating beautiful images similar to the @entity51 toys popular in the 1970s			1
this design is based on transition paths for the first 10,000 digits of pi here , dots are used to represent the adjacency between digits showing the progression and transition for the first 10,000 digits of pi he also created a series of images showing ʽbubblesʼ outside the main image to signify where particular number sequences occur			2
ʽthe bubbles that count the number of links quickly draw attention to regions where specific digit pairs are frequent , ʼ he explained			0
ʽfor instance , there is a large bubble on the 9 segment due to the sequence ' 999999 ' sequence at decimal place 762.ʼ the team also manipulated the digits to create spiral patterns made up of large dots as part of their series of pictures			0
the digits of pi are , as far as we know , randomly distributed			0
art based on its digits therefore as a quality that is influenced by this random distribution			0
to provide a reference of what such a random pattern looks like , below are 16 random numbers represented in the same way			0
they 're all different , yet strangely the same , the designers said the transition probabilities for each 10 digit bin for the first 2,000 digits of pi , phi and e are shown in this image			0

designers @entity6 and @entity8 created the works of art
their stunning images show the number π , the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter as well as other numbers
they connected each digit of π to its successive digit with links to the position of the numerically corresponding segments to make the artwork
