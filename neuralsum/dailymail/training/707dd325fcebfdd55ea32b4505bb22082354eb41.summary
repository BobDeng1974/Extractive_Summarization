by @entity0 the good people of @entity2 were n’t exactly shy about their contribution to the last olympics where they won as many gold medals as @entity7			0
so while the rest of the country reflects on @entity12 ’s @entity11 shambles , those in the white rose county can claim bragging rights if @entity16 go all the way under a manager who was made in @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity21 , the man in charge of @entity23 in @entity24 , spent three - and - a - half formative years in @entity2 between 1978 and the end of 1981 ; two seasons at @entity27 with @entity28 and 12 months at @entity29			1
made in @entity2 ? @entity16 boss @entity21 had spells in @entity12 as a player although he did n’t have the same meteoric impact as @entity34 ’s two @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity36 , @entity21 ’s team - mates and managers from that era believe his years in @entity12 helped him develop the managerial skills now being seen in the @entity11			1
professional , popular and strong - willed , @entity21 also had a twinkle in his eye			1
his @entity28 team - mate @entity43 recalls with a smile : ‘ he would stitch me up like a kipper so i ’d be blamed for little tricks he ’d played			1
’ @entity21 also received advice passed down from @entity50 , one of @entity12 football ’s great managers , via his @entity20 manager @entity53			1
welcome addition : @entity21 moved to @entity12 after joining @entity28 in 1978 for two seasons ‘ the gaffer ( @entity57 ) always used to say if a player ’s wife was happy , the player would be happy and he ’d be at his best , ’ said @entity53			1
‘ it ’s something i told @entity21 and he is n’t daft , he will know the key to @entity16 is keeping @entity64 and the others happy			1
then the talent can take over			0
’ and @entity64 has sparkled so far at this @entity11 , with @entity16 playing @entity67 on saturday for a place in the semi-finals			1
@entity21 was 23 when he moved from @entity16 to @entity19			1
the myth is that @entity28 manager @entity71 refused to pay £ 500,000 for @entity72 on a scouting trip to @entity74 and bought @entity75 as a cheaper option			1
in reality , @entity71 was never going to get near @entity72 , who was already tipped for superstardom at 16			0
the @entity80 boss was happy to land another talented left - footed midfielder for £ 160,000			1
leaders : @entity75 ( right ) and @entity64 ( left ) have guided @entity16 to the @entity11 quarter - finals @entity43 was in awe of the exotic @entity74 who was suddenly training alongside him			1
‘ @entity21 was a really good player , ’ he says			1
‘ i learned a lot from him			0
no matter what the condition of the pitch , he ’d wear rubbers on his boots rather than screw - in studs , which was an eye - opener to me			2
even on a wet muddy pitch			0
’ @entity21 learned his first word of @entity12 , ‘ backheel ’ , at training and picked up the language from there			1
he quickly cottoned on to @entity12 dressing - room culture , to @entity43 ’s cost			1
‘ he was the first player i ’d ever seen who would n’t go out to warm up on the pitch before matches , ’ recounts @entity43			2
‘ he ’d stay in the dressing - room and do his own stretches there			2
‘ before a game at @entity109 i stayed inside with him			0
at one stage i had to pop to use the loo			0
after the game the lads came in and when they tried to put their shirts on , the sleeves had knots in them			0
when they put their socks on the toes had been cut off			0
i got the blame for it because i was a bit of an idiot in those days but it was @entity21			2
‘ he ’d set me up and nobody believed me			0
he ’d even cut the ends off his own socks to make it look like he was a victim , too			0
he still does n’t own up to it but there ’s a cheeky smile when it ’s mentioned			0
’ cheap as chips : blades boss @entity71 ( left ) signed @entity21 ( right ) for £ 160,000 even as a young man 7,000 miles from home , @entity21 had the natural authority and strength of character which are hallmarks of successful managers			1
team - mate and neighbour @entity140 said : ‘ he would n’t train on a friday which would cause a few arguments between him and the coach @entity144			2
it was to do with @entity21 ’s culture — he did n’t want to run the slightest risk of injury			2
‘ the players took to him easily			0
he was humorous , intelligent and quickly picked up the banter			0
he would knock on my door and we ’d spend evenings together watching football videos			0
he was very serious about the game			0
’ club legend : @entity75 's ( right ) displays for @entity28 soon endeared him to the fans and his team - mates @entity28 did n’t have a good team and were relegated from the old @entity161			1
but @entity21 was their best player and after a season in the @entity164 he was snapped up for £ 400,000 by @entity20 , who were in the top flight			1
‘ some fans gave him a tough time when he joined @entity20			1
he was spat at in @entity19 when he was out shopping with his family , ’ says @entity43			0
‘ despite that he loved @entity12 and our football			2
he still speaks excellent @entity12			2
i saw him in @entity16 a few years ago and he asked about getting a manager ’s job here			2
then he went to @entity175 as manager , did well and the rest is history			0
‘ he was a great player			2
he would have won 50 caps for @entity16 but unfortunately for him he was in the era of @entity72			2
’ pastures new : @entity21 joined @entity20 in 1980 for £ 400,000 after @entity28 were relegated to the @entity164 while @entity21 is still regarded as a @entity80 legend - his defence - splitting pass for @entity186 ’s goal against @entity187 in 1978 made it to video as one of the greatest goals seen on @entity192 - he struggled at @entity20			1
he was tough enough for the old @entity193 but probably not quick enough			0
the club had sacked the manager who signed him , @entity195 , and replaced him with club legend and former @entity12 @entity11 striker @entity53			1
@entity21 ’s wife felt homesick			2
‘ he came to see me and said his wife was unhappy , and she wanted to go back home , ’ said @entity53			0
‘ i did what @entity50 would have done			0
i did n’t want @entity21 to go , he was a very good player with an excellent left foot , but keeping him when his family were unhappy would n’t have worked out for anyone			1
so i helped him find a club and we let him go to @entity175			0
when i heard he ’d got the @entity16 job , i thought : “ blow me , it ’s him ! ” ’ hard graft : @entity75 struggled at @entity212 outfit @entity20 as his family became homesick even in the early 1980s there were signs @entity21 was an educator who took people with him			1
‘ @entity21 was a big influence on me , the way he ’d do extra training sessions , treat the game properly , ’ says @entity43			2
‘ and he was n’t soft			0
the game in @entity16 might be more open than in @entity12 but you still get tackles flying in			1
‘ most importantly , he understood footballers			0
he knows when you ’ve got someone as outrageously talented as @entity64 , you are obliged to get the best out of him and build your team like that			0
if he was able to help me to be decent , he ’ll be able to turn @entity64 into a world champion			0

@entity16 boss @entity21 is hoping to guide his side to @entity11 glory this *summer*
@entity21 enjoyed a three - and - a - half year spell in @entity12 as a player
@entity21 joined @entity28 for £ 160,000 in 1978 and soon became a club idol
@entity21 joined @entity20 following the @entity80 relegation in 1980 for £ 400,000
