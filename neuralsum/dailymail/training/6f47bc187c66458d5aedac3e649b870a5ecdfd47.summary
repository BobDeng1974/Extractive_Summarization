by @entity1 reporter published : 15:00 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 15:18 est , 1 june 2013 in what would be the largest ever takeover of a @entity7 company by a @entity9 firm at $ 4.7 billion , @entity3 has agreed to be purchased by @entity9 's largest meat producer			1
now residents of the small town of @entity13 in southeastern @entity14 that was built by and still revolves around the ham company wonder what the purchase means to their community			1
you ca n't go far in this historic southeastern @entity14 town without seeing a pig and reception to the news is as mixed as whether the locals favor salt - cured or sugar - cured ham			1
major hams : @entity3 in @entity13 , @entity14 , the world 's largest pork producer has agreed to be bought out by @entity9 meat giant @entity29 a herd of life - size swine statues lines its downtown , an ornament of a piglet wearing a bandanna adorns a front lawn , hams hang in storefronts and a pickup truck flaunts the license plate ' pig time			1
' @entity3 agreed to the multi-billion dollar offer from @entity29 , the majority shareholder in @entity9 's largest meat processor			1
the deal still faces a federal regulatory review and @entity13 shareholder approval			2
steps from the site where the company was founded in 1936 , residents in the ' @entity49 ' greet each other on a main street lined with white picket fences and @entity54 - style homes , and welcome a neighbor back from a recent trip out of town			2
just down the road , workers shuffle into the company 's packing plants for their shifts			2
looking out on the street that 's lined with antique cars every weekend , locals frequent @entity69 and @entity70 , grabbing their morning coffee and pastry			2
some are shocked that ' @entity9 would own our @entity13 , ' said @entity75 , a longtime resident who owns the eatery			1
' it 's @entity13 ham , it 's not @entity9 ham , ' @entity77 said			1
big business : the $ 4.7 billion deal would lend even more sway to the @entity84 group , @entity9 's biggest meat producer , and would be the largest takeover of a @entity7 company by a @entity9 firm ever and she 's right : pork produced here for more than 300 years became so popular that many places in the 1930s tried to pass off their ham as @entity95 , which led to branding each ham so customers knew it was authentic			1
the state even passed a since - revised law in 1926 , stating the ' @entity95 ' moniker could only be used for cuts of peanut - fed hogs processed and salt - cured in the town limits			0
the town also is home to the world 's oldest cured ham from 1902 at the @entity109 museum - complete with its own brass collar around the hock			1
as important as the pork itself is @entity3 , which employs about 3,800 people in @entity14			1
in its most recent fiscal year , it brought in sales of more than $ 13 billion and made a profit of $ 361 million			0
the company , its founding family - the @entity119 - and those who work there donate time and money to the community , funding parks , public restrooms and other projects			2
' you either have a family member who works there , or has worked there , or you had a summer job there			0
it 's just such a part of our community , ' said @entity137 , the director of a local arts center and a more - than - 40 - year resident whose husband 's family has been in the area since 1666			0
' @entity13 has been so good for the town			1
' hostile takeover ? @entity13 has long been the heart of smalltown @entity13 , @entity14 and locals now wonder what might change with its namesake and well - being on the line , @entity13 native and mayor t. @entity152 , 71 , hopes the pending sale does n't compromise the town 's identity			1
' they say that everything 's going to stay the same , and we all just hope that it does , ' he said			0
his wife , @entity161 , works at @entity162 , a hometown restaurant the company opened about a year ago to showcase its products			0
' we 'll just see where it ends up , time will tell			0
' in an interview with the @entity1 , @entity3 ceo @entity167 said the move showed ' the globalization of the world and how it affects small - town @entity7			1
' ' but @entity13 , @entity14 , has nothing to worry about , ' @entity167 said			1
' we 're in a mature market ... and to continue to grow we have to look at opportunities outside the @entity7			0
' @entity177 , who worked as an accountant at @entity3 for about 10 years before retiring , sees only ' good things happening ' for the company that has had its share of ups and downs over the years			2
changing times : workers approach the gates of @entity13 foods			0
ceo @entity167 said the move showed ' the globalization of the world and how it affects small - town @entity7 ' pork producers such as @entity13 have been caught in a tug of war with consumers			1
the company needs to raise prices to offset rising commodity costs , namely the corn it uses for feed			0
but consumers are still extremely sensitive to price changes in the current economy			0
by raising prices , @entity13 risks cutting into its sales should consumers cut back or buy cheaper meats , such as chicken			0
in 2009 , @entity3 posted its first annual loss since 1975 , and again in 2010 , but has since rebounded			0
and one of its largest shareholders had been pushing @entity13 to consider splitting itself up in recent months			2
' somebody 's got ta own it , ' @entity177 said			0
' it 's just money			0
it does n't bother me as long as it does n't change our philosophy , our life , our politics ( and ) it does n't shut down places			0
' @entity137 agreed : ' when you think about it , that should be very good economically for the company ... and what 's good for the company is good for us			2
' there is at least one drawback that residents note : they 'll soon be unable to own @entity13 stock - a tangible piece of the company named after the town that pork built .			1

@entity3 , the world 's largest producer of pork , has agreed to be acquired by @entity9 's largest meat processor , @entity29 , in the largest takeover of a @entity7 company by a @entity9 firm in history
