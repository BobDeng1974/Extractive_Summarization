pothole : a section of the @entity85 at @entity62 , @entity4			0
mr @entity2 was travelling along this road when he swerved to hit a pothole and fell into the path of an oncoming car			1
it is not known how deep the pothole was when inspected by council staff five weeks before the tragedy , the inquest heard			2
