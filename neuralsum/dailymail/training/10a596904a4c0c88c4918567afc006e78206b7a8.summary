by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 11:53 est , 30 may 2013 a @entity2 artist turned his fascination with maps into art - by building maps of cities at key points in their history out of books and music set at the time			0
@entity13 has built @entity14 and @entity15 , 19th century @entity16 , and turn - of - the - millennium @entity18 among his creations , which are based on each era 's maps			1
singed and blackened paper represents scorched land at @entity24 following the 9/11 attacks , in @entity14 during the @entity26 and also following the @entity27 in 1666			0
elsewhere , vivid yellow paint brings to life the excitement of the @entity31 while a quote from @entity34 's @entity33 winds through the river of @entity36 in a depiction of the city before the @entity40 invasion in 1812			2
@entity41 in the early 1940s has been recreated by @entity13 out of pages from books			2
he burned pieces of paper from @entity47 's @entity46 , a thriller set in the @entity26 , to show the damage in @entity50 , left , while @entity51 , right , is made from @entity53 's 1943 novel @entity52 @entity54 , left , is made of pages of @entity56 by @entity57 while @entity58 , right , is made out of 2009 's @entity59 by @entity60 the @entity63 @entity62 bomber is seen over the @entity64 - which @entity13 brought to life using pages of books set during the @entity69 coventry at the time of the 1940 bombings has been recreated using the sheet music for @entity75 's @entity74 , which was commissioned for the consecration of the new @entity77 in 1962			1
the lyrics were taken from first world war poems by @entity80 and also form part of @entity13 's map @entity83 used pages from novels by @entity53 , @entity60 , @entity57 and @entity47 to show @entity14 following the bombing raids by @entity63 aircraft			1
his technique of burning the paper where destruction was left injects the maps with character - making them seem more like an aerial view of the damage than just an outline of the streets and giving each city a sense of personality			1
another wartime - based creation shows @entity15 after the city suffered its own blitz , made of paper bearing the music for @entity75 's @entity74			2
@entity75 composed the requiem for the consecration of the new @entity77 , which was built next to the ruins of the one destroyed in the war			0
in this paper sculpture , the @entity63 city of @entity111 is recreated to show how it looked after it was bombed by allies in february 1945 @entity13 's sculpture attempts to recreate the damage in @entity111 following the bombs , seen her in february 1945 @entity75 's music and the lyrics , taken from work by @entity122 poet @entity80 , form the walls and streets of @entity15 in @entity83 's creation			1
he also acknowledges the destruction at @entity111 in 1945 left by @entity128 bombers , using burnt copies of the score to @entity131 and singeing the ground of the map to show where bombs landed			0
elsewhere , the artist turned to pages from @entity138 's @entity137 to make @entity14 in 1666 , based on a map of the time of the @entity27 which began in a baker 's and raged for days , destroying thousands of homes and @entity143 , which went on to survive the @entity26			0
his modern day work includes a dazzling @entity31 , electrified by neon paint and made using pages of @entity149 's @entity148 in @entity31 , while a sculpture of lower @entity151 shows the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001			0
artist @entity13 created a 3d map of @entity14 in the time of the @entity27 in 1666 out of book covers of @entity138 's @entity156 a painting of @entity14 in september 1666 - now @entity13 has recreated a map of the time out of book covers the dark patch of scorched earth at the end of the island dominates the piece , which was built from newspaper headlines in the days following the hijacking of four planes , two of which hit the @entity171 's twin towers			1
pages from @entity174 's @entity173 also made up blocks and buildings in the creation			0
@entity13 was born in @entity178 , studied at the @entity179 and is now based in @entity180 in the @entity181			2
he told @entity182 : ' i think my interest in [ maps ] was born out of walking , the imagination of place that maps create in the mind and a long term fascination with travel , landscape and geography			0
' @entity151 is seen post- 9/11 in this sculpture , with blackened paper showing where the twin towers of the @entity171 once stood this aerial shot shows the smouldering destruction at @entity24 following the two hijacked aeroplanes crashing into the @entity171 - recreated in paper by artist @entity13 1970s @entity31 is depicted in vivid yellow paper torn from copies of @entity149 's 1971 novel @entity148 in @entity31 using the pages torn from @entity149 's novel , depicting hedonism in @entity31 , helped @entity83 in his mission to make maps seem more representative of the cities they show the luminescent yellow of @entity83 's @entity31 map mimics the bright lights of the city itself @entity83 used pages of @entity221 's novella @entity219 and the score of @entity75 's opera to create a modern - day map of @entity226 's canal city @entity83 's paper cuts capture the winding @entity228 , as seen in this aerial shot @entity83 's map of @entity230 , @entity16 's second largest city , is created with clean lines of white , cream and blue @entity230 sits on the @entity234 which gave artist @entity13 an interesting shape to work with in this map of @entity36 based on the damage from the 1812 fire , a quote from @entity34 's @entity33 is carved into the @entity240			1
' the comet which was said to portend all manner of horrors and the @entity245 ' , it reads			0
the rest of the piece is made from sheet music for @entity250 's @entity249 @entity13 's map is based on an 1812 map of the damage of the @entity254			1
this engraving shows the @entity16 setting fire to @entity36 before @entity40 's army arrived , destroying most of the city			2

@entity13 's maps go beyond a *simple* *a-z* look at a city and give a sense of what it was like to be there
