by @entity1 reporter published : 16:07 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 03:57 est , 3 september 2012 search : it was hoped the spade would provide clues to the final resting place of victim @entity7 a forensic expert is carrying out tests on a rusty spade discovered on @entity11 which could prove to be a dramatic new breakthrough in the search for the body of the last missing victim of child killer @entity16			1
it was hoped the tool would provide clues to the final resting place of victim @entity7 , whose mother @entity16 died last month without ever knowing what became of his remains			1
the 12 - year - old was abducted and murdered by @entity16 in 1964 and is the only one of the five young victims whose body has never been traced			2
but @entity28 , senior lecturer in forensic analytical science at @entity30 , who has been examining the spade , said he has been unable to trace its history			0
he said : ' it is very , very corroded			0
the metal in it appears to be a reasonable steel that pre-dates the start of recycling			0
' there was some vegetation attached to it and was found in an area of peat			0
' the handle had been broken off , but even if we had lots more time , and even if we had established that it was a spade from the 60s or pre-dated the 60s , we would not have necessarily established if it was anything to do with @entity16			1
' although some vegetation has survived , there is very little chance of @entity60 having survived			0
' he said the spade has now been returned to its finders , members of @entity72 , who had been searching the area for signs of where @entity7 's remains lie on the moor outside @entity79			1
@entity80 , 74 , who remains in prison after being locked up for life , had been urged by police to ' at last do the decent thing ' and finally tell @entity7 's family where he buried him on @entity11 so he can be given a @entity87 burial			1
grief : @entity7 's mother @entity16 , pictured on @entity11 above @entity90 , died last month having never been able to lay her son to rest torment : many attempts have been made to find the remains of @entity7 on @entity11 , but without success @entity7 's brother @entity97 , who was nine when his brother was taken off the street by @entity80 and the @entity100 , said he will remain in the possession of the murderous pair until his body is found			1
writing on his website , @entity105 , mr @entity7 said : ' as far as i am concerned , until @entity7 is found then he is still in the possession of @entity80 and @entity54			1
' our fear as a family is that now my mother is no longer with us , this may be seen by the police and the media as some sort of closure to the case			0
' this must not be allowed to happen both out of respect for @entity7 and my mother 's memory and for those of us who loved them both			2
' the family 's lawyer , @entity125 , said of the spade : ' as far as i was concerned it was going to be subject to forensic tests and until we know whether or not it is relevant there is no comment from me or the family			2
' we are keeping an open mind until the results of the tests are revealed			0
' a spokesman for @entity139 said it did not have any information about the spade			0
video : police have searched @entity11 for many years			2

*justice* *campaigners* *unearth* rusty tool on bleak @entity11
spade handle is *snapped* off *...* something @entity80 admitted doing after he had buried bodies
find is just weeks after @entity7 's tormented mother @entity16 dies
