@entity1 has suffered from a sleep disorder all her life , it causes her to hallucinate during the night , believing that her dreams are real @entity1 stood at the end of her bed in the darkness , trembling from head to toe with terror			1
the scene before her was surreal — yet she did n’t question it for one second			0
there , looming in the shadows , like something out of a horror movie , swung a large bubbling vat of acid , poised precariously over the bed and its sleepy occupant , her partner @entity19			0
it seemed clear he was about to be scarred for life			0
‘ @entity19 , @entity19 ! ’ she screamed , pulling at the bed sheets			1
‘ @entity26 they ’re going to pour acid on you ! get up now ! ’ but @entity19 did n’t flinch			1
instead , he slowly got out of bed , sighed deeply , and led @entity1 gently back to her pillow			1
‘ there ’s no acid , ’ he murmured			1
‘ go back to sleep			2
i ’ve got to get up in an hour			0
’ @entity19 was all too aware the vat of acid did n’t exist because , on a nightly basis , he ’s woken by @entity1 ’s terrifying hallucinations that can include burglars , objects floating around the room and even spirits			1
she suffers from a rare form of parasomnia — or sleep behaviour disorder — which occurs halfway between sleep and wakefulness , in what ’s known as the ‘ hypnagogic state ’			1
when @entity1 gets out of bed at night , she is not acting out her nightmares , since technically she is not fully asleep			1
instead , she is hallucinating — and she feels the adrenalin rush of very real fear			0
released from the usual muscular atonia , or weakness , of sleep , @entity1 can walk around , talk , gesture and scream			1
she is not fully conscious , but instead reacting to a dream - like world , conjured from the depths of her half - asleep brain			1
but it ’s no laughing matter : the true awfulness of the condition lies in the regularity with which it happens			0
for @entity1 , who ’s 30 and a doctor ’s receptionist from @entity69 , @entity70 , these scenes occur every night — and sometimes up to six times an evening			1
each episode lasts several minutes , and occasionally poses a real danger to her and her long - suffering partner			0
‘ one night , i woke up to find @entity19 pulling something out of my mouth , ’ she says			1
‘ he ’d turned the lights on and looked absolutely terrified			2
he told me i ’d woken him up and informed him in hushed , appalled tones that there were robbers in the house who wanted to steal my jewellery			0
i ’d then grabbed all my rings and stuffed them in my mouth			0
@entity19 had to fish them out to stop me choking			0
i ’ve never seen him so frightened			0
’ @entity1 is with her partner , @entity84 ( right )			1
@entity1 's condition can be incredibly dangerous , she attempted to swallow her rings one night and was saved from choking when @entity19 realised what she 'd done other forms of parasomnia include sleep - eating ; sleep sex , in which sexual acts are carried out by a person who ’s asleep ; and somniloquy , when someone talks aloud while sleeping , even making long speeches			1
some disorders , like @entity1 ’s hallucinatory somnambulism ( sleepwalking ) , are associated with partial waking up — and many are thought to have a genetic component to them			1
indeed , @entity1 ’s mother and aunt suffer from the condition , too			1
@entity1 was four when she first remembers it happening			1
‘ i had tonsillitis and a fever			2
i woke up and saw yogurt pots and spoons marching around my bedroom , ’ she says			2
‘ i screamed out to my mother and she soothed me back to sleep			2
she told me it was just a bad dream			0
’ all children suffer nightmares , of course , and some experience night terrors with a sleepwalking element to them , particularly when they ’re feverish			2
but @entity1 ’s parasomniac episodes did n’t stop there			1
they increased in frequency and intensity , until , by the time she reached her 20s , she was suffering night - time hallucinations many times each night			0
if it happened when she was alone , she would barely remember it the next day			0
but when friends came to stay , they were in for an eerie shock			0
‘ i once had some girlfriends over , and got up in the night believing they were trapped in nets or plastic bags , ’ she says			1
‘ i ran over to them , screaming , trying to “ free ” them from suffocation			2
’ @entity1 took to warning boyfriends of her ‘ dark side ’			1
‘ at night , i ’d see all sorts of things — burglars , people standing in the room , floating objects , police coming to arrest us			2
some boyfriends would be understanding			0
’ by the age of 24 , she was at her wits ’ end , and at last went to her gp , who prescribed sleeping pills			2
‘ i tried one brand and it did diminish the hallucinations a little , ’ she says			1
‘ but i ’d wake up so groggy and exhausted , it was counter-productive			2
i was as tired as if i ’d been up six times as usual			0
’ over the years , @entity1 has tried various pills but none stopped the disorder completely			1
often she ’d be so exhausted she could n’t focus at work			0
in her late 20s , she was referred to a sleep clinic , but to her disappointment , found no answers there either			0
@entity1 ( pictured aged 2 ) remembers her first experience of the condition aged four ‘ i hoped they ’d analyse my sleep patterns but they did n’t , ’ she says			1
‘ the consultant simply told me i would “ grow out of it ” , which i found strange as i was already an adult			2
’ children do grow out of some disorders associated with the hypnagogic state			1
the form of sensory distortion known as @entity182 , for example — where people feel as though parts of their body shrink or grow — is thought to affect far more children than adults			2
yet other parasomnias affect those of any age			0
some are associated with anti-depressants , or with neurological disorders such as parkinson ’s disease , stroke , or narcolepsy , where the brain ’s ability to regulate a normal sleep - wake cycle is seriously compromised			0
it ’s believed that up to 10 per cent of the population suffer a sleep disorder at some stage of their lives			0
it is thought that @entity1 ’s ( pictured aged 12 ) hallucinatory somnambulism could be genetic , both her mother and aunt suffer from the same condition a year ago , @entity1 began dating @entity19 , who ’s also 30 and an engineer			1
it was love at first sight , she says — yet her excitement was tinged with anxiety			0
‘ i know it sounds a cliche , ’ she says , ‘ but i knew he was “ the one ” almost immediately — and that terrified me			1
‘ there was a cloud hanging over me : my night - time episodes			2
what if my sleep disorder ruined everything and scared him away ? i was so afraid of it that i put off spending the night with him			0
’ before they did , she resolved to sit @entity19 down and tell him just how freaky her night - time behaviour could get			2
‘ i told him i suffered from a sleep disorder and that it could make me do all sorts of strange things , ’ she says			1
‘ but he just smiled and said i would n’t get “ night terrors ” with him there			2
i hoped he was right			0
’ before @entity1 and @entity19 spend the night together for the first tine , @entity1 sat him down to explain her sleep disorder as she was so afraid that it would put him off remarkably , for a while , he was			1
for a few days @entity1 did n’t suffer any hallucinations at all			1
‘ @entity19 even joked that he ’d cured me , ’ she says			1
‘ i almost dared to believe him			2
’ the lull did n’t last , and over the next few weeks , @entity19 witnessed everything : ‘ me screaming that i was naked in a see - through bed			1
grabbing his face in the dark to check it was him and not an intruder			0
telling him things were falling from the ceiling ; screaming that someone was about to pour acid on him			0
’ a shift - worker who sometimes has to get up at 5am , poor @entity19 spends much of his day exhausted			2
‘ but he ’s so supportive , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ he just holds me and tries to calm me down until it passes			0
he ’s used to it by now , and he wo n’t let me sleep in the spare room			0
some nights he finds me dusting off his face and body because i can see ants crawling all over him			0
he just rolls over and goes back to sleep			0
’ @entity1 and @entity19 are thrilled to be expecting their first baby together , but @entity1 is concerned that the child may inherit her condition @entity1 and @entity19 have since taken precautions , such as removing all sharp objects , including nail scissors and files , from the bedroom and ensuring the windows are closed			1
they ’ve also removed mirrors , since reflections of light seem to trigger @entity1 ’s episodes			2
together , they even came up with a comic name for the ‘ other ’ @entity1 that emerges each night — @entity285 : the @entity1			1
thankfully , @entity285 is n’t always in evidence — and now @entity1 and @entity19 are expecting their first baby			2
‘ i ’m thrilled we ’re about to start a family but i ’m also frightened about how i ’ll cope with the baby and my sleep disorder , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ will i constantly be waking it ? or worse , what if i get up and drop it ? @entity19 says he ’ll have the baby on his side of the bed , which will be safer			0
‘ i could always make light of my sleep disorder before			0
in lots of ways it was a nightmare , but i could joke about it			0
‘ but now that our baby ’s on the way , it ’s different			0
most of all , i really worry that he or she will inherit my condition			0
’ yet there is no one better qualified than @entity1 to help a child through the disorder			1
no one who knows exactly what it is to crave the simple pleasure of a good night ’s sleep .			0
