by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:30 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 10 june 2013 doing it alone : in parts of the @entity6 , 75 per cent of families are headed by a single parent			1
most of them are mothers a million children are growing up in ‘ men deserts ’ , living without a father and rarely meeting an adult man , a study of family breakdown said yesterday			2
it said the continuing increase in the number of lone parent families means that in some areas three out of four families are headed by one parent			1
their children , most of whom are growing up without fathers , lack the influence of men not only at home but also in the other key areas of their lives , the report from the @entity24 said			2
in particular few ever meet men at school			2
one in four of all primary schools has no male teacher and four out of five have fewer than three , it found			0
the report described the impact of family breakdown as an ‘ emergency ’ and said that the response of politicians of both @entity45 and @entity46 has been ‘ feeble ’			0
it urged @entity48 to ‘ get a grip ’			0
the findings are potentially embarrassing for the prime minister because the @entity24 is the brainchild of work and pensions secretary @entity53 , who launched it in 2004 shortly after being deposed as @entity56 leader			0
its director @entity57 said : ‘ for all of the promises the @entity56 made in opposition , hardly anything has been done to resist the tsunami of family breakdown battering the @entity65			0
’ the study , family breakdown : the @entity68 , said numbers of lone parent families are rising by 20,000 a year and will reach a total of two million before the next election in 2015			1
some areas are dominated by single parent families , it found			1
in one area of @entity79 , @entity80 , 75 per cent of households with dependent children are lone parent families			1
in @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 and @entity86 in @entity87 , the level is more than 70 per cent , and in 15 other places more than 60 per cent			1
in all , 236 localities have more than 50 per cent of homes with children headed by a sole mother			1
male figures : on top of a million children having no worthwhile contact with their fathers , the lack of male primary school teachers is adding to the crisis in male role models founder : @entity53 launched the @entity24 in 2004			2
its report said @entity48 needs to ' get a grip ' on the situation league table : the report said the lack of male role models is a national crisis but that parts of the @entity6 are the worst - off the report said half of all children now being born will not grow up with both their birth parents and that in all a million children have no worthwhile contact with their fathers			2
it added : ‘ lack of male role models in many young lives is further compounded by the dearth of male teachers within state primary schools			0
money matters : single parent households are costing taxpayers £ 46 billion a year although these trends are nationwide , they are particularly pronounced in our poorest communities where two thirds of all young adolescents have seen their parents part			1
’ it said the costs of family break - up were ‘ devastating ’ , adding that children from broken families are 50 per cent more likely to do badly at school , struggle to make friends , find it difficult to control their behaviour , or to overcome anxiety and depression			1
the report estimated the cost of family break - up , including the price in benefits for state support of families without work , at £ 46billion a year , or £ 1,541 for each taxpayer			1
it projected that the bill will rise to £ 49billion by 2015			0
the main engine of family break - up , it said , is the spread of cohabitation			1
‘ it is the instability of cohabiting couples rather than a surge in divorce rates that is fuelling the disintegration of the @entity65 family , ’ the report said			0
‘ since 1996 , the number of people cohabiting has doubled to nearly six million			0
cohabiting parents are three times more likely to separate by the time a child is aged five than married couples			0
’ since the election mr @entity48 has failed to act on his pledge to give a tax break to married couples			0
he has , however , promoted same - sex marriage even though there was no mention of the subject in the @entity56 manifesto or the @entity185 agreement .			0

number of single - parent families rising by 20,000 each year
areas of @entity79 , @entity191 and @entity84 have *largest* amount of single parents
children from broken homes 50 per cent more likely to struggle at school
family break - ups are costing taxpayers £ 46 billion a year
