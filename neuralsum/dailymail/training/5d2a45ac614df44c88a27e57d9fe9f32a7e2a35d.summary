who needs a centre - forward when you have @entity3 ? the little @entity4 rescued strikerless @entity5 on saturday as @entity8 ’s men glossed over their injury problems to make it eight wins in a row and join @entity13 at the top of the @entity15			1
@entity16 was given the false no 9 role because of injuries to @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , but it was @entity3 who provided support and , ultimately , the knockout punch with two quickfire goals in the second half			1
the 28 - year - old is referred to as ‘ @entity29 ’ by team - mates because of his wizardry on the ball and the only surprise was that he waited for more than a year to score at the @entity34			2
@entity3 ( right ) struck his second goal after the interval to send the champions right back into the title race @entity5 players celebrate @entity3 's goal as they move level on points with @entity13 at the top of the table @entity3 ( right ) opened the scoring with a heavily deflected shot during @entity5 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity48 @entity49 completed the rout with his side 's third goal from a thunderous strike towards the end of the game @entity49 added a cracking third goal in the 81st minute and @entity5 are now level on 39 points with @entity13 and only one behind on goal difference , while @entity61 ’s side face a difficult trip to @entity63 tomorrow			1
@entity8 was happy with his experiment of using @entity16 up front			0
it was the player ’s seventh different outfield position in his @entity5 career			2
‘ i was always confident because i thought we played well in the first half			0
we showed patience to create space so i was absolutely sure we would score in the end , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity16 did well , it was a sacrificed performance			0
he is a player who works really hard and created a lot of movement			0
“ i am happy the squad as a whole demonstrated why we won the league			0
we had no @entity19 , no [ @entity82 ] @entity81 , no @entity21 , and others showed what they can do			1
’ it was @entity3 , though , who made the difference and justified @entity90 ’s assertion that he was “ head and shoulders ” above any other player on the pitch			1

but just as @entity5 feared they would not achieve a breakthrough , they were given some help early in the second half			2
@entity99 started the move with a clever pass to overlapping @entity95			1
the @entity188 cut the ball back instead of shooting and although @entity3 did not make great contact , his shot went between @entity114 ’s legs , deflected off the inside of his thigh and past @entity111			1
‘ i ca n’t blame the wingers for not tracking back , a defender let us down , ’ said @entity48 boss @entity90			0
the relief was evident and it was no surprise that after 61 minutes @entity8 and his assistant , @entity200 , were punching the air with joy once again			0
it was another good build - up			0
@entity102 and @entity49 were involved , and this time the overlapping full - back was on the left — @entity98			2
he swept in a cross and this time @entity3 connected first - time with his left foot to beat @entity111 from eight yards			1
it was a classy finish from a classy player and showed how much @entity5 missed him when he was sidelined with a knee injury			2
@entity48 had a fleeting chance at 2 - 0 down when @entity116 headed in @entity123 ’s cross and was wrongly flagged offside because @entity99 was playing him on			1
@entity95 ( 2nd left ) missed @entity5 's best chance of the game in the first - half the @entity188 defender grimaces as his clipped effort veers inches wide of the post to the relief of chasing @entity48 defenders @entity95 reacts after missing a gilt - edged opportunity to give @entity5 the lead at the @entity34 @entity3 broke the deadlock after the interval after being set up by @entity95 to score a heavily deflected shot @entity3 started and finished an intricate passing move that led to @entity5 's opening goal - click here to see more stats from our brilliant @entity139 @entity95 ( left ) congratulates @entity3 after setting up his team - mate for the opening goal @entity3 races off after finally breaking down the stubborn @entity48 defence with a slightly fortunate shot @entity5 players celebrate together after taking the lead against @entity48 in the second - half ‘ it was miles onside and a goal then would have put the whole stadium in doubt , ’ complained @entity90			1
but given that @entity116 was lucky to escape unpunished for a dive in the first half , you could perhaps call it ‘ karma ’			2
@entity3 was substituted soon afterwards to a standing ovation , replaced by @entity101			0
@entity48 sent on @entity252 , on loan from @entity254 , and therefore the recipient of some pantomime boos from @entity5 fans			2
the third goal came in the 81st minute			0
@entity259 used his pace to break from midfield , his pass to @entity16 was then shifted on to @entity49 , and he powered through to blast a left - footed finish past @entity111			1
@entity16 departed soon afterwards leaving @entity49 to assume the role of centre - forward and there was even a late rare cameo for forgotten man @entity103 — just in time for other clubs to have a peek ahead of the january transfer window			1
at the back , injured skipper @entity271 was hardly missed and keeper @entity94 was rarely troubled 24 hours after signing a new four - and - a - half year contract			1
@entity3 ( right ) meets @entity276 's cross to double @entity5 's lead just after the hour mark the @entity283 international watches his shot into the back of the net to give the champions a commanding lead @entity48 defenders look dejected after seeing @entity3 score his second goal in a man of the match performance @entity3 appears to point towards the bench after scoring his second goal during a typically masterful display @entity3 was replaced by former @entity13 midfielder @entity101 ( right ) shortly after scoring his second goal @entity49 ( right ) raced on to meet a pass from @entity16 to seal victory with a thumping left - footed shot into the top corner @entity101 runs to congratulate @entity49 as @entity5 draw level with @entity13 after closing what was an eight - point gap @entity13 realise they have a huge job on their hands if they are to take the @entity15 trophy from @entity5 who have settled after an autumn wobble			1
‘ you do n’t win the title in december but you play so many games , you must be as close as you can if you want to be involved at the end , ’ said @entity8			0
‘ maybe nobody believed one or two months ago that we ’d still be in the @entity310 or fighting for the title , but we always trust in what we can do			0
’ @entity8 does not expect to have any of his ‘ real ’ forwards to be fit for the @entity314 to @entity315 but @entity21 , nursing a hamstring strain , has the best chance of facing @entity318 on december 28			0
on saturday , @entity5 did not need a striker			0
not when they had @entity3 .			0

@entity5 moved level on points with @entity13 following a 3 - 0 defeat of @entity48 at the @entity34
with @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 injured , @entity16 started as a *makeshift* striker
@entity95 came closest to opening the scoring in the first - half but his effort was clipped inches wide
@entity3 broke the deadlock with a deflected shot on his 200th appearance for the @entity334
the ' wizard ' doubled @entity5 's lead after meeting @entity339 's cross just after the hour mark
@entity48 and @entity343 midfielder @entity116 had a goal wrongly *disallowed* for offside
@entity49 completed the rout with a thunderous strike from @entity16 's pass towards the end of the game
city have won six *consecutive* league games but a fourth goal would have seen them top on goal difference
