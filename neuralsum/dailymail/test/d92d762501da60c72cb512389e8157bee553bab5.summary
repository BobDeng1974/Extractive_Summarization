he could have put it anywhere really			0
stuck it away simply , without too much fuss			0
yes , there was a goalkeeper still to beat but running straight on to the target , not a blue shirt in range , the odds were most certainly with @entity10			2
yet every great player has a showman inside and the @entity13 is no exception			0
his finish — curled into the top corner , right - footed , inch perfect , yet explosive — was a moment of pure pleasure , a flourish that will not be forgotten			0
it was also @entity21 ’s third — probably the goal that puts this tie beyond reach			1
here was a goal - scorer at the top of his game , playing for a club that now brings the best out of him			1
if there ever was a battle of egos at @entity21 , it is over and football has won			2
@entity10 scores his second goal , sending @entity38 keeper @entity37 the wrong way , to make it 3 - 0 to @entity21 @entity10 nutmegs @entity41 for the second time as he eases past the @entity44 defender on his way to another stunning strike former @entity47 defender @entity41 is left dejected after being embarrassed by @entity10 for the second time on wednesday evening @entity10 ( centre ) celebrates his goal as @entity38 's players are left dejected after being unable to stop the @entity13 @entity38 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity37 6 ; @entity51 5.5 , @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 5.5 ( @entity41 21 , 5.5 ) , @entity54 6 ; @entity55 6 ( @entity56 65 , 5 ) , @entity57 5 , @entity58 7 ; @entity59 5.5 , @entity60 5.5 , @entity61 6 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 goals : @entity69 18 , @entity10 67 , 79 bookings : @entity57 , 36 manager : @entity72 6 @entity21 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity73 6 ; @entity74 6 ( @entity74 80 ) , @entity75 6.5 , @entity76 8 , @entity77 6.5 ; @entity78 7 , @entity79 5.5 ( @entity80 74 , 5 ) , @entity81 6 ( @entity82 53 , 6 ) ; @entity10 8.5 , @entity83 6.5 , @entity69 7.5 subs not used : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 bookings : @entity75 , @entity83 manager : @entity91 7 @entity92 : @entity10 referee : @entity94 ( @entity95 ) 7 stadium : @entity96 by @entity97 @entity83 is playing with joy again , and bringing the best out of @entity69 and @entity10 , too			1
the @entity100 have scored more goals than any @entity103 team away from home this season — and all have come from their forward trio			0
@entity10 has 11 goals in his last 11 games for @entity21 , and six in six in the @entity103			1
@entity111 fans will not enjoy hearing this , but he seems at home			0
so maybe it has something to do with the players after all			0
@entity10 was n’t schooled in tiki - taka or the @entity21 way , but the combination of an energetic high pressing game married to quite gorgeous technique and invention fits him like a glove			1
as @entity21 ’s old boss , @entity124 , struggled with his new group against @entity126 , @entity21 marched on , their philosophy enduring beyond coaches or academies			2
they buy great players , and these players often do great things			0
that is the @entity21 way too			2
@entity38 got a late and lucky consolation goal that some will feel keeps this tie competitive , but for those of a more earthbound persuasion it is hard to see it as anything but over			1
@entity10 killed it with his two goals leaving @entity38 to seek a 3 - 0 win at the @entity145 inside 90 minutes to progress			1
and they have n’t got nil in them — not against this trio			0
@entity41 was @entity10 ’s victim here , and he took chunks out of his reputation , without so much as a baring of teeth			1
for once , though , sympathy was with the @entity44			0
a hamstring injury was due to keep him out for a month — and that was just 10 days ago			0
shorn of key individuals by injury and suspension , @entity72 started with @entity41 on the bench — and was forced to promote him to the action after 21 minutes when @entity53 limped out of the game			1
@entity21 were already ahead by then and instantly one feared for @entity41 against opponents with such flair and movement			1
it took a while , but eventually those fears were realised			0
@entity41 , to his credit , was up for it — he just was n’t up to it , which is different entirely			2
@entity10 would have known that , and known @entity41 ’s defensive frailties even when fit from his time in the @entity177 , and the way the goals were scored suggested he had no compunction capitalising on it either			1
@entity10 scores his first goal of the night to make it 2 - 0 to @entity21 after bustling past three @entity38 defenders @entity10 nutmegs @entity41 wide on the right touchline on his way to scoring @entity21 's second goal of the evening @entity10 runs away to celebrate his goal as he joined by his ecstatic team - mate @entity69 , who had earlier made it 1 - 0 to @entity21 @entity10 is mobbed by his jubilant @entity21 team - mates after his first goal as they enjoy their trip to @entity192 basically , to get nut - megged once is unfortunate ; to have it happen twice suggests someone is trying to make you look a twit			1
this was street football — and not for the first time @entity41 was cast as the plaything of a hapless gamer			2
what skill by @entity10 , though			2
collecting the ball on the right flank , he turned and put it through @entity41 ’s legs , leaving him helpless and unable to recover			2
@entity10 then held off two @entity38 players as he darted through the tightest of gaps into the penalty area , finishing past an equally defeated keeper @entity37			1
his next was even better			0
through the middle , charging directly at @entity41 , embarrassing him with a nutmeg again , before finishing in style , an absolute gem of a goal			2
it is hard to imagine how , even with the fillip of @entity220 ’s deflected shot , @entity38 can claw this back			1
@entity72 ’s team have enormous spirit as @entity47 discovered and held their end up here , too , but @entity21 simply have too much class			2
they took their chances and @entity38 did not — a fatal flaw with the odds already stacked against them			2
@entity69 ( centre ) opens the scoring for @entity21 after just 18 minutes with a side - foot shot into the bottom right hand corner of the goal @entity69 celebrates his fourth @entity103 goal in eight matches this season by putting the ball under his shirt @entity69 is mobbed by @entity21 team - mate @entity83 , who provided the assist for the @entity44 's goal @entity21 worked the ball well for @entity69 to open the scoring - click here to read our brilliant match zone from the game @entity60 was the prime culprit and he had a night of clumsy control and missed opportunity when it mattered most			1
@entity250 says that he is the best player in the world , better than @entity83 or @entity252 — but not all of @entity250 ’s statements are shot through with wisdom			0
@entity61 set the tone for @entity38 in front of goal , by making a hash of their first chance of the night			1
when they did finally score it was only because a tame shot by @entity51 der @entity220 took a spiteful deflection off substitute @entity80			0
@entity21 started well and could have gone ahead when @entity83 hit a post with a curling 20 - yard shot after 14 minutes			1
it served as a warning and four minutes later @entity21 went ahead			1
the move began , as so many do , with @entity78 breaking up play			0
from there , @entity21 countered with terrifying speed , @entity83 feeding @entity69 , who finished astutely with only @entity37 to beat			1
he could have had another after 26 minutes when a fine jinking run forced a good save			0
@entity61 fluffs his lines as he misses a brilliant chance to put @entity38 1 - 0 up against the run of play @entity220 's ( left ) late deflected effort gave @entity38 a glimmer of hope ahead of the second leg next week shortly before half - time the @entity280 was needed again , when @entity41 took on too much sweeping up at the back and was caught in possession by @entity10			1
he curled a shot which @entity37 plucked out of the air , the last time he would get the better of their exchanges			0
not everything @entity21 does is beautiful , however			0
@entity289 ’s dive under pressure from @entity53 after five minutes was deeply unimpressive and deserved a booking			0
@entity94 , the referee , ducked out of that one , although he did later book @entity83			0
one to tell the grandkids , no doubt , although they might be more interested in a retelling of @entity10 ’s goals			0
@entity60 ( centre ) sees his diving header fly wide of the target as @entity21 keeper @entity73 is left helpless @entity72 and his coaching staff react after seeing @entity38 struggle to contain @entity21 in the @entity96 @entity95 manager @entity302 ( left ) poses for a picture with a fan at the @entity96 before kick off @entity192 prime minister @entity305 ( left ) speaks with former president @entity306 in the stands			1

@entity69 opens the scoring for @entity21 after just 18 minutes thanks to an assist from @entity83
@entity10 makes it 2 - 0 after a brilliant individual goal - nutmegging @entity41 before beating two more defenders
@entity10 scores his second of the night in equally stunning fashion - again nutmegging @entity41
@entity220 's deflected effort gives @entity38 some hope ahead of the second leg on april 21st
