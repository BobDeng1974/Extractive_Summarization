' certainly she went with grandmother and parents to the forest , to gather berries			2
perhaps this is why she was not afraid of the forest			0
' @entity15 herself is a very strong girl , has a strong - willed character			2
this probably helped her to survive			0
' ' the forest around @entity282 is full of bears , ' said rescuer @entity284 , who revealed his men needed armed guards in looking for @entity15			2
' close to the gunners we felt somehow calmer			0
however , the thought of bears immediately switched to another concern : somewhere in the forest was this helpless child			0
' the breakthrough came when rescuers found @entity15 's footprint on the bank of a river when she had gone to drink water			1
next to her print , was the paw mark of a dog			0
