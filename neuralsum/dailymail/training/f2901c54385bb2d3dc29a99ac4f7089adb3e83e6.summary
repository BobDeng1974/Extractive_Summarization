by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 07:40 est , 28 january 2013 an @entity4 lady peddling products door - to - door is a familiar sight			1
but now you might just find it ’s a man standing on your door step offering up beauty tips			2
according to new figures , the ‘ @entity4 man ’ is the newest phenomenon of the recession , as men turn to direct selling after losing their jobs because of the downturn			1
there ’s been a five per cent increase in representatives in just two years , with men making up a quarter of that number — a 26 per cent increase in three years			1
game changer : @entity24 had more than 50 unsuccessful job interviews and now earns more as an @entity4 salesman than at his previous job in insurance ‘ i knock on the door and say , “ you clearly need this anti-wrinkle cream , do you want it ? ” and , bizarrely enough , that sales technique works , ’ says @entity24 , 39 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , one of a growing number of unlikely beauty gurus			1
‘ when i was a child , i did n’t imagine i ’d one day be selling lipsticks through letterboxes			0
i got a lot of raised eyebrows from customers when i started being an @entity4 man , but i enjoyed that surprise			2
brush up : it seems some of the new generation of @entity4 men may still need to brush up on some essential skills that ladies have down ‘ at first , i did n’t have a clue about the products , but women seemed to like that naivety and now i use it to my advantage to help me sell			1
’ when he was made redundant from his job in insurance last march , @entity24 had more than 50 job interviews			0
‘ i was on the scrapheap , ’ he confesses			0
‘ every day i looked at my two sons , knowing i was supposed to be making something of myself for them			0
i felt like a failure			0
’ @entity24 ’s wife of seven years , @entity65 , was an @entity4 sales rep and asked him to help her out			1
they started door - to - door together and , six months later , were managing 70 other representatives			2
@entity24 is now earning more than he used to in the insurance industry			0
but while making inroads in a women ’s world , it seems some of the new generation of @entity4 men may still need to brush up on some essential skills			1
‘ demonstrating make - up is a bit beyond me , ’ confesses @entity24			2
‘ i make the pitches , but i ’d lose customers if i showed women how to apply foundation and mascara			0
‘ i can do an @entity85 look , but that ’s about it			0
