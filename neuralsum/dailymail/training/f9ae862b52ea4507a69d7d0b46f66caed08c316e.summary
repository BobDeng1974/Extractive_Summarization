never mind @entity1 , now it ’s @entity2			2
@entity4 ’s stars have failed to live up to expectations and do n’t even look as though they are enjoying their football under the @entity7			1
that ’s the damning assessment from @entity10 ’s veteran striker @entity9 who has vowed to target @entity12 ’s soft centre in defence when the two clubs meet in the @entity16 fifth round at @entity17 on monday night			1
@entity18 warned his players after wednesday night ’s unimpressive @entity21 win over @entity22 that @entity12 will go out of the cup if they play as badly again against their @entity25 opponents			1
@entity9 does not believe all is well under @entity4 at @entity12 @entity9 trains with @entity27 team - mates ahead of their @entity16 clash with @entity12 the former @entity30 striker claims that @entity12 's star players do not look like they are enjoying their football and @entity9 , who faced @entity12 in their pomp on numerous occasions for @entity30 , believes they are still way short of their best despite investing more than £ 150million on new players last summer			1
united fans are growing increasingly critical of the style of play under @entity18 , and @entity9 detects that the players are less than happy with the new regime as well			1
he said : ‘ just looking at one or two of the players			1
@entity47 scoring last night , there was no real smile and he did n’t look particularly happy			1
@entity44 playing a bit deeper , it ’s probably different to what those players are used to			1
‘ players do n’t particularly like change anyway , but a new manager comes in with new ways and are they enjoying it as much as they used to ? i do n’t get that impression from the players that they are			2
‘ when you lose someone like sir @entity65 it ’s always going to take time			1
players have to adjust to a different regime			2
you are doing double sessions when you maybe are not used to doing that kind of thing			2
is the training more tactical ? is it more five - a - sides ? these things can take an effect			2
@entity76 ( centre ) controls the ball during a training session at @entity80 @entity81 ( centre ) dribbles the ball as the @entity25 side look to pull off a massive @entity16 upset @entity4 's expensively assembled side have failed to live up to expectations ‘ @entity22 caused them no end of problems			1
on paper , the squad they have and the money they ’ve spent , they are fantastic players but i do n’t think they ’re quite living up to those expectations			2
‘ the fans are a bit frustrated with the style of play			1
they ’re not exciting as they used to be but the club has had big change			2
‘ they ’re dividing opinion			2
i ’ve got quite a few friends who were at the game last night and are pleased to be back in among the @entity107 places but there are a few boos about long balls and the style of play has not been great			1
‘ this year they have got a bit of resilience about them			2
not playing and winning games , you have to have			2
i think he ( @entity18 ) has not quite had the settled side			2
there are always injuries and a couple limped out last night			0
i do n’t think he ’s quite found the right system			0
’ @entity9 , 37 , claimed that @entity12 ’s main weakness lies in central defence and believes that @entity18 ’s side would not be in third were it not for goalkeeper @entity129			1
despite a 3 - 1 victory , @entity12 were tested by struggling @entity22 in their last @entity21 game @entity12 players can appear unfamiliar with what @entity18 requires of them ‘ you have to identify that as their weakness , ’ he added			1
‘ that ’s what i certainly feel			0
when you consider that @entity129 has been their best player this season – something i do n’t think anyone can argue with – he ’s not been that well protected and without him they would n’t be in those top - four positions , i do n’t think there is any question about that			0
‘ and that suggests they have not had a settled back - three or back - five at times because of injuries			0
whether he would have picked the same team anyway what with squad rotation you do n’t know			0
‘ but i think defence is an area they will need to improve if they get back into the @entity107 and start challenging again for the @entity21 title			0
‘ with @entity162 being so strong and @entity163 also being ahead of them , that is an area of the pitch that they need to improve in the summer i think			0
i really think the squad needs an overhaul and he has started to do that			0
‘ but he is not going to be able to do it in one or two windows			0
it will take three or four			0
i think he will get it right			0
we will see @entity12 over the next six or 12 months get better and better and play a better style of football			1
’ @entity9 has faced @entity12 on numerous occasions during his time in the @entity21 @entity10 manager @entity180 ( centre ) speaks to his players during the training session @entity9 ( left ) and @entity76 are put through their paces ahead of their @entity16 clash on monday @entity9 claims that @entity10 will be looking to exploit @entity12 's weaknesses in defence asked about the claims by his old @entity30 boss @entity190 that @entity12 had played long - ball football against @entity192 last week , and @entity18 ’s bizarre response in producing statistical evidence to the contrary , @entity9 could n’t help but smile			1
‘ @entity190 was obviously having a little sly dig , ’ he said			0
he did it to @entity200 last year and got the better of him as well			0
‘ i think the response from @entity18 surprised a few			0
we ’ll be looking to defend the ‘ long sideways passes ’ a bit better , so we ’ve been working on that ! ’ @entity9 blames @entity12 ’s withdrawal from the @entity16 in 1999 for helping to dent the attraction of the old competition in the eyes of some people , but insists that it still remains the most important trophy for him			1
goalkeeper @entity129 has been @entity12 's stand - out performer this season @entity214 is reportedly unhappy at not playing full games under @entity18 @entity192 manager @entity190 has criticised @entity12 for using long - ball tactics it is also @entity18 ’s best hope of silverware in his first season in @entity222 football , and @entity9 – who reached the final with @entity224 and semis with @entity226 and @entity30 – has promised to give the @entity7 a run for his money on monday			1
‘ the cup has had a lot of criticism in recent years , ’ he said			0
‘ probably since @entity12 did n’t enter the competition it ’s gone down in the pecking order			1
‘ but , for me , i ’d rather win that over the @entity107 any day			0
i ’m an @entity222 and my memories growing up watching those finals and playing professionally and getting close			0
we go into this game looking to cause an upset			0
‘ @entity18 says himself they are one of the favourites now for this trophy and we ’ve got to make it as hard as possible for them			0
they would obviously like to get their hands on the @entity16 but hopefully we will have a say in that			1
‘ we saw how much trouble @entity22 gave them the other night and we are capable of doing that			1
we can look back at their games against @entity250 and @entity251 and take note			0
it ’s another tricky game for them			0
‘ we can hurt them going forward and we have got defenders who are willing to defend hard and put their bodies on the line			0
@entity214 , @entity44 , @entity47 , @entity259 , @entity260 , there are so many players and it ’s exciting to come up against them and test ourselves			1
