by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 4 april 2013 @entity1 has revealed an amazing timelapse animation showing the @entity4 's parachute blowing in the @entity6 wind			1
the images were obtained by the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) camera on @entity10 as it passed overhead			1
taken between aug. 12 , 2012 , and jan. 13 , 2013 , they show the used parachute shifting its shape on the surface and it is blown about by winds			1
the parachute ’s suspension lines were made from @entity27 , with a fiber similar to @entity29			1
the color is a creamy yellow , which is why they are not visible in the images such as those in the @entity36 lander descent image which were white			1
the photos from @entity1 's @entity10 show how the parachute that helped @entity1 's curiosity rover land on @entity6 last summer has subsequently changed its shape on the ground			1
the images were obtained by the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) camera on @entity10			1
seven images taken by @entity8 between aug. 12 , 2012 , and jan. 13 , 2013 , show the used parachute shifting its shape at least twice in response to wind			1
sometime between september 8 , 2012 and november 30 , 2012 , there was a major change in which the parachute extension to the southeast ( lower right ) was moved inward , so the parachute covers a smaller area			1
in the same time interval some of the dark ejecta around the backshell brightened , perhaps from deposition of airborne dust			2
another change happened between december 16 , 2012 and january 13 , 2013 , when the parachute shifted a bit to the southeast			1
this type of motion may kick off dust and keep parachutes on the surface bright , and researchers say it may help to help explain why the parachute from @entity69 ( landed in 1976 ) remains detectable			1
researchers have used @entity8 to study many types of changes on @entity6			2
the @entity4 parachute is the largest one of its kind ever constructed , coming in about 65 feet in diameter ( you can see a scale here ) the gap between the white and orange - hued sections prevented the chute from becoming torn during the descent phase			1
its first image of @entity4 's parachute , above , caught the spacecraft suspended from the chute during descent through the @entity6 atmosphere			1
after entering the @entity6 atmosphere at 13,200mph , the capsule containing @entity4 slowed by friction and then a supersonic parachute			1
an ' upper stage ' resembling a flying bedstead was then be deployed , firing retro rockets to brake its descent			2
as it hovers over the landing site , the upper stage transformed itself into a ' sky crane ' and lowered curiosity to the surface on the end of a tether			1
the contraption then broke away , and deliberately crashed			2
the latest pictures were captured by the @entity8 craft , the @entity8 camera on board the @entity10			1
the 65 kg ( 143 lb ) , $ 40 million instrument was built under the direction of the @entity112 's @entity113 by @entity114 curiosity descending to the red planet was captured by the same spacecraft that has now seen its parachute shift on the surface it consists of a 0.5 m ( 19.7 in ) aperture reflecting telescope , the largest so far of any deep space mission , which allows it to take pictures of @entity6 with resolutions of 0.3 m / pixel ( about 1 foot ) , resolving objects below a meter across			1

it 's the @entity6 version of spring break : curiosity and @entity149 , along with their spacecraft friends circling overhead , will take it easy this month because of the sun 's interference			2
for much of april , the sun blocks the line of sight between @entity156 and @entity6			2
this celestial alignment — called a @entity6 solar conjunction — makes it difficult for engineers to send instructions or hear from the flotilla in orbit and on the surface			2
such communication blackouts occur every two years when the red planet disappears behind the sun. no new commands are sent since flares and charged particles spewing from the sun can scramble transmission signals and put spacecraft in danger			2
mission teams prepared by uploading weeks of scaled - back activities beforehand			0
' they 're on their own , ' said @entity177 , chief @entity6 scientist at the @entity178			0
the rovers are banned from driving			0
instead , they take a staycation and study their surroundings			0
the orbiting @entity184 and @entity10 continue to listen for the rovers and make their own observations , but for the most part will transmit data once @entity6 is in view again			1
opportunity , @entity184 , @entity10 and the @entity191 's @entity190 have survived previous bouts of restricted communications			1
it 's the first for @entity4 , which landed last year near the @entity6 equator to hunt for the chemical building blocks of life			0
the positions of the sun , @entity156 and @entity6 , at left			0
radio communications between @entity156 and @entity6 are limited during this planetary alignment , which occurs in april			0
spacecraft in orbit around @entity6 and on the surface will not receive new commands during this period			2
next month , @entity6 will be passing almost directly behind the sun , from @entity156 's perspective			0
the sun can easily disrupt radio transmissions between the two planets during that near - alignment			0
beginning thursday and through may 1 , curiosity can only check the weather every hour , measure radiation and look for signs of water below the desert - like surface			2
the limited chores are a departure for the active six - wheeler , which is used to driving , drilling and zapping its laser at rocks			0
before the sun got in the way , @entity4 made its biggest discovery yet : from a drilled piece of rock , it determined that its crater landing site was habitable billions of years ago , possessing some of the basic ingredients necessary to support tiny microbes			0
scientists must wait until next month to drill into another rock and start the long - delayed trek to a mountain where @entity4 will search for the elusive organic molecules that are fundamental to life as we know it			0
the road trip was supposed to have started last year , but longer - than - expected science experiments put @entity4 behind schedule			0
@entity184 , circling @entity6 since 2001 , has experienced half a dozen blackout episodes with no problem			0
this time , it will try something new			0
there are plans to radio @entity156 every day even if calls are dropped , mostly to keep engineers updated on @entity4 's health			0
the rover is also programmed to send daily beeps to ground controllers			0
by contrast , the @entity10 will record and store information onboard its computers and beam it back after the hiatus			1
@entity149 , which parked itself in a clay - rich spot , will use the down time to study a rock and track the amount of dust in the sky			0
with @entity6 missions on autopilot , many scientists and engineers planned to take vacation while a small crew remains on duty			0
' we 've been through this before , ' @entity177 said			0
' we 're not expecting to have any problems during this period			0
let 's hope it stays that way			0
' how @entity4 got to @entity6			0

images taken over several months by the @entity10
show the giant parachute shifting on the surface as *martian* storms move it about
