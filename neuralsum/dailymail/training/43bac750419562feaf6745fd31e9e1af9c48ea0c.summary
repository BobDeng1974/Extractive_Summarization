by @entity1 reporter many favourite first names from just a century ago are at risk of dying out or are already extinct , new research reveals			1
extinct names - those that were among the most popular in 1905 , but are no longer chosen - include @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 for girls plus @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 for boys			1
names classified as ' endangered ' include @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 for boys and @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 for girls			2
names classified as ' endangered ' include @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 for girls and @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 for boys			2
it means the names are at risk of dying out but are currently still in use , including by @entity29 and singer @entity30 , left , and former shamed @entity32 star @entity31 , right extinct names - those that were among the most popular in 1905 , but are no longer chosen - include @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 for boys			1
' @entity34 ' is used by @entity35 frontman @entity36 , left , while @entity22 - which is classed as ' endangered ' is famed by @entity39 aka @entity38 , right researchers analysed millions of birth records from 1905 to the present day			0
names classified as ' extinct ' were those that were in the top 100 in 1905 but not present in the 2012 lists			0
' @entity46 ' names were those that had fallen in prevalence by 99 per cent , while ' at risk ' names were those that had fallen by 98 per cent			0
the study , by family history website @entity52 , showed names in the ' at risk ' category - those still being chosen , but significantly less common than they used to be - include @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 for boys , plus @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 for girls			1
many popular names from the early @entity68 have also evolved to their shorter form , which has replaced their previous name in popularity			1
termed the ‘ @entity73 ’ , this trend has seen @entity74 replace @entity75 , @entity76 overtake @entity77 and @entity78 become far more popular now than @entity79			1
the same applies to girls ’ names , with @entity82 replacing @entity83 , @entity84 making way for @entity86 and @entity87 overtaking @entity88			0
names in the ' at risk ' category - those still being chosen , but significantly less common than they used to be - include @entity60 , like that of @entity94 , right , and @entity95 , famed by inventor @entity96 , left the analysis also showed far more girls ’ names disappearing or ‘ at risk ’ than boys - thought to be because many mens ' names are passed on from father to son , whereas mothers ’ names are more likely to be selected as middle names , rather than forenames , for daughters			1
however , many of the most popular names of 1905 remain common today , driven by the fact that one in three parents ( 34 per cent ) choose their child ’s name to commemorate an ancestor			2
such names include @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 for girls and @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 for boys			2
and a number of names have surged in popularity or become fashionable recently , overtaking the level of popularity seen in the early 1900s			0
many of the most popular names of 1905 remain common today , including @entity130 - possibly thanks to pop star @entity132 , right - and @entity123 - like that of @entity135 hunk @entity134 , left @entity136 , @entity78 and @entity137 fall into this category , as do @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			1
@entity142 , @entity144 ’s @entity143 content manager , said : ' of course , no first name can truly become extinct , as it can easily be resurrected , but it ’s fascinating to look at the list from 1905 and see which have thrived and which have faded into obscurity			0
' we also know that people appreciate a rare or unusual name in their family tree and as more people join the family history revolution we believe that such endangered names will be protected by concerned descendants			0
' @entity158 is a traditional name which has boomed over recent years and topped many ' top 10 boys ' names ' lists , perhaps thanks to @entity158 , pictured ‘ @entity163 ’ - ( none recorded in latest birth records ) : @entity12 , @entity13 & @entity11 female - @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity166 , @entity7 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 & @entity170 ’ - ( have fallen in prevalence by 99 per cent since 1905 ) : @entity172 , @entity16 , @entity173 , @entity17 & @entity18 female - @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity174 , @entity21 , @entity175 & @entity177 ’ - ( have fallen in prevalence by 98 per cent since 1905 ) @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity178 , @entity59 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity34 , @entity183 , @entity184			0
