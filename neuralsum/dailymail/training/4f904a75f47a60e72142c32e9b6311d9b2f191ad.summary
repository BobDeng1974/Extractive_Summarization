' @entity39 is a thriving business which contributes significant benefits to the area and we will continue to work closely with the club to explore all possible avenues for keeping them here at their original home			2
' @entity2 's hopes of moving rest on convincing fan - led group @entity49 to sell them the freehold of their current home , something they failed to do at an extraordinary general meeting in october			0
@entity62 , the group of @entity49 shareholders who spearheaded the opposition to their bid six months ago said : ' the viability of redeveloping @entity25 is still a very relevant issue , with @entity27 and @entity28 openly contradicting the club 's negative projections			1

' our joint bid was submitted in accordance with the sales process established by the joint administrators for the site			0
the process could run for a number of months			0
' we also appreciate that we have many significant hurdles to address if we are to build a new stadium on the site , including winning the support of our fans , the @entity49 shareholders and local @entity9 residents , as well as securing the approval of @entity68 , the @entity98 and heritage authorities			2
' any new stadium is likely to contain four separate stands in accordance with the wishes of @entity2 's fans , with a 15,000 - seater single - tier south stand			2
