@entity2 mandarins launched an extraordinary 13 - month effort to block the @entity5 inquiry from publishing explosive memos between @entity7 and @entity8 , it emerged last night			1
cabinet secretary sir @entity10 ’s attempts to keep the correspondence secret led to a major stand - off with @entity5 inquiry chief sir @entity13 — and pushed back the publication of his report by a year			1
astonishingly , sir @entity13 admitted he still did not know when the inquiry – which has already cost £ 9million – would finally be published , five - and - a - half years after it was launched			1
mps said that without the delays , the report would have been published by now and they criticised the ‘ unnecessary suffering ’ caused to the relatives of the servicemen and women who died			1
sir @entity13 , giving evidence to the @entity39 , described how the lengthy negotiations with the civil service over his request to publish classified material – including 30 notes between mr @entity7 and president @entity8 – was ‘ crucial ’ in causing the delay			1
he revealed that sir @entity10 ’s predecessor , @entity46 , ruled that the memos were ‘ not disclosable ’ as a group			2
negotiations with sir @entity10 – nicknamed ‘ sir @entity52 ’ by his critics – on what to release began in august 2013 and did not conclude until september last year			2
sir @entity13 described the discussions as ‘ agonising ’ and ‘ very long and difficult and challenging ’ on both sides			1
critics have questioned whether sir @entity10 was the right person to arbitrate on the documents as he was principal private secretary to mr @entity7 in @entity59 from 1999 to 2003 – when the decisions to go to war were taken			1
sir @entity13 , himself a former civil servant , refused to criticise sir @entity10 and denied his efforts amounted to ‘ obstruction ’			1
@entity39 sir @entity65 intervened during sir @entity13 's opening statement to bring it to a close the former top civil servant was hauled before @entity70 to explain why his report will not be published before the general election sir @entity13 was appointed by @entity73 sir @entity13 , the former @entity2 mandarin charged with heading the @entity5 investigation , sat on the ' whitewash ' @entity77 into the use of intelligence in the run - up to the conflict			1
sir @entity13 was one of the leading members of the inquiry which exonerated the @entity7 government for ' sexing up ' the case for war			1
his appointment by @entity73 raised fears in @entity90 of the latest in a long line of establishment cover - ups - following @entity77 and the @entity94 report into the death of dr @entity96			2
a career diplomat , sir @entity13 , is an intelligence expert who was principal private secretary to @entity98 during his time as @entity101 home secretary and also spent seven years as top civil servant in the @entity104 office			1
but he said it took a ‘ considerable time ’ before sir @entity10 finally gave way and agreed to publish redacted versions			2
‘ the initial view taken by the previous cabinet secretary was that the notes – for example that mr @entity7 had sent to president @entity8 – were not disclosable , ’ said sir @entity13			1
‘ there was a strong convention that interchanges of that sort should not be disclosed in public			0
‘ as we went through , point by point , with the current cabinet secretary , it became increasingly clear that , on the balance of argument , he would agree that a certain passage or a certain point could be disclosed because of the essential nature of our inquiry , which related to the workings of central government			0
' that came to a point where it was no longer possible to sustain a doctrine that these documents , as a category , could not be disclosed			0
’ sir @entity13 said that members of his committee insisted on their publication after ‘ retiring politicians and statesmen ’ referred to issues in them in their memoirs			1
continuing on the subject of inquiry delays , sir @entity13 pointed to departments being slow in producing documents he requested – saying the government ‘ found it difficult to respond as quickly as we would have liked ’			1
his revelations angered mps demanding the report be made public as soon as possible			0
former @entity101 shadow home secretary @entity154 said : ‘ we at last know that the sir @entity31 tried every trick in the book to block the publication of the single most important piece of evidence , the correspondence between @entity7 and @entity8 , which will throw most light on the reasons we went into this disastrous war			1
’ and the @entity5 - born @entity101 mp @entity166 said : ‘ i ’m convinced that if it had n’t taken 13 months for these documents to be declassified we would have the report by now			2
’ he told the committee the failure to publish the report had created ‘ uncertainty ’ that was ‘ clearly painful for the families ’			0
however , the revelation that sir @entity13 dug in his heels during his standoff with @entity2 is likely to raise hopes his inquiry will be full and comprehensive when it reports			1
he said he had a ‘ duty to deliver the truth ’ to the families of those who died and revealed the inquiry had examined some 150,000 documents			0
‘ the more we read the more lines of inquiry arose , ’ he added			0
it was ‘ really not possible to say ’ when the report would be published , as letters to those criticised in it , informing them of its conclusions and giving them the chance to respond , are still being sent out			0
@entity101 backbencher @entity154 has blamed the @entity198 , which has the final say over which documents relating to @entity5 can be published , for the delay in the report 's publication inquiry member sir @entity204 died last night sir @entity13 paid tribute to the renowned historian sir @entity204 , who died last night after a long battle with cancer			1
he said sir @entity204 , a member of the @entity5 report 's panel since 2009 , had helped the inquiry with his ' wisdom and insights '			2
the 78 - year - old was the official biographer of sir @entity216 and also one of the world 's pre-eminent @entity218 historians			0
he was born in @entity220 in 1936 but was evacuated to @entity221 as a toddler when the @entity223 took hold			0
still a young child , he returned to @entity24 and was living near @entity226 as the war drew to a close he authored over 80 books , many on @entity231 topics , in a life that also saw a national service stint in the @entity234			0
his works included classic histories of the first and second world wars , ' @entity238 , ' and ' @entity239 in the @entity240			0
' @entity7 the former prime minister is expected to be rebuked for his role taking the @entity24 to war in 2003 and therefore has a legal right to reply to any criticisms in the report			2
@entity247 , the former @entity248 president , has claimed ' well - known names ' involved in the inquiry were seeking to ' water down ' the strength of criticism against them in the report			0
but mr @entity7 has repeatedly rejected any suggestion he is behind the delay , saying last year : ' i have got as much interest as anyone in seeing the inquiry publish its findings and then being able to go out and frankly restate my case and defend my position			2
' mr @entity7 was also accused of holding up the report by not allowing correspondence with @entity8 to be published – but , again , has repeatedly denied this was the case			1
sir @entity13 the inquiry chair is facing increasing criticism for his own responsibility for the delay			1
he has missed every deadline which he had set – and senior figures have privately said this has nothing to do with the witnesses those criticised in the report only received the draft inquiry conclusions about them just before @entity279 – leaving them almost no time to respond before the may election			0
it also understood that the report is incredibly long – running to a million pages - and criticises many more people than just @entity7 , increasing the amount of time it takes to respond			2
sir @entity10 the cabinet secretary – @entity24 's most senior civil servant – was allegedly behind moves to block the publication of personal correspondence between the former @entity293 president @entity8 and mr @entity7 in the run - up to the war			1
there are concerns in @entity298 that the move would represent an unprecedented breach of confidence with @entity24 's closest ally			0
only in june last year @entity303 announced he was satisfied that the ' gist ' of talks between @entity7 and @entity8 could be made public , removing a big obstacle to publication of his report			2
@entity73 @entity310 said the report should have been published years ago – and pointed out that @entity312 had voted against a proposal to set up an inquiry in 2006			2
the @entity303 enquiry was only finally set up by @entity73 in 2009			0
illness the prime minister has confirmed that illness may have played a part in the @entity5 inquiry taking so long to report			0
@entity204 , the @entity216 biographer and inquiry member , who had been ill , died last night			0
earlier sir @entity65 said @entity13 himself had been ill too			0
the spooks @entity323 is expected to be heavily criticised in the report over its mistaken intelligence that @entity326 had weapons of mass destruction			0
it is expected to put up a fierce defence of its role – and will be concerned that its sources are not blown .			0

sir @entity13 said ' not possible to say ' when report will be published
ex civil servant was hauled before @entity70 to explain long delays
inquiry into the causes of the war was ordered in 2009 by @entity73
it was held up by legal *wrangling* over letters between @entity7 and @entity8
top civil servant @entity10 held up publication of correspondence
inquiry has already cost *taxpayers* £ 9million and could cost millions more
mps reacted *angrily* to failure to give indication when it will be published
@entity166 said the failure to publish causing unnecessary suffering
