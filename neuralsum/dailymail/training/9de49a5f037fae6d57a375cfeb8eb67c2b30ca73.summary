a woman who alleged she was raped at a party by four men , including two college football players in 1998 , has discovered that all of the evidence in the case has been destroyed			1
@entity7 had not been named publicly until recently when she told her story to @entity10 sports columnist @entity9			2
but during a meeting with the president of @entity13 she was heartbroken to learn that a catalogue of mistakes had been made and all of the evidence was gone			1
speaking out : @entity7 , 40 , from @entity16 , bravely came forward to give her account of how she was brutally raped and sodomized 16 years ago president @entity18 had offered an apology to @entity7 in november , after years of silence , and vowed to review the university 's response to see if there were actions the school could take now			1
but during their meeting this month , which lasted more than hour , he handed her a two - page letter in a plain envelope			2
it outlined @entity13 's internal investigation into its handling of her alleged gang rape in 1998 by four men , including @entity38 ' football players @entity36 and @entity39			1
and while he said the university condemned the alleged brutal rape , and stressed that the institution had committed a ' moral failure ' in her case , nothing would be done			2
ms @entity7 , who decided not to participate in the case told @entity9 she now wishes she had			1
she told @entity18 : ' i 'm stuck with this memory of four men surrounding me , high - fiving as they treated me like garbage			1
it just does n't equate			2
' @entity13 president @entity18 ( pictured ) personally apologized to @entity7 for the school 's failure to support her through the ordeal but has confirmed nothing will be done @entity13 head football coach @entity61 suspended two of the men for one game and was quoted as saying they had made ' a bad choice ' - a remark he now regrets making ' i do n't know how to feel about all these people not caring , ' she said			1
' i do n't know what this says about me , or human beings in general			0
' the four men were arrested in 1998 , but prosecutors did n't press charges because ms @entity7 decided not to participate in the case			1
@entity7 told @entity9 she now wishes she had			2
the @entity10 found that the university community never responded after she reported the assault and poor decisions were made by local police and the district attorney 's office			1
evidence was destroyed years before the statute of limitations expired - despite the strong urging by a deputy district attorney to preserve it			1
ms @entity7 told how she had decided in 1998 to go through with a rape examination and then to commit suicide because ' i was already dead			1
' but the kindness of the nurse who did the rape examination got her through and inspired her also to become a nurse , she said			0
she came forward 16 years later because she remained haunted by the words of @entity13 coach @entity61 , who said two players had made ' a bad choice			1
' ms @entity7 went to police in 1998 to say she was gang - raped , sodomized , robbed , and then re-victimized			1

@entity13 defensive back @entity36 , right , was 18 when he was named as a suspect @entity127 , who served 19 years as the vice provost for student affairs told @entity10 : ' @entity131 assaults were murky			1
' if @entity7 's report had escalated to a student - conduct hearing in 1998 , it would have been @entity127 's duty to handle any appeal - but it did n't			1
@entity127 added : ' i look back now and think , ' ( @entity138 ) , we could have really done something			0
' ' we had no idea back then how to conduct an investigation , it was a difficult road			0
there 's no comparison between now and then			0
' there 's no point in even trying to draw a straight line -- good luck -- because one does n't exist			0

he said : ' i came upon my name in the story and i just let out a , ' oh s â€”			0
' meanwhile , at @entity13 , the administration could not do anything , because @entity7 had reported the alleged crime to an @entity13 sexual assault support counselor named @entity161			1
@entity161 talked with @entity7 and later obtained a copy of the police report			2
the counselor gave the 38 - page report to the university 's student conduct department			0
