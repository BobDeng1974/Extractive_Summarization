bouncier than a space hopper and smoother than spun silk , there 's no doubt @entity4 of @entity6 's hair was a triumph on tour @entity8			1
and the secret of her swingy , super-glossy ' rich girl hair ' ? it 's rumoured that last year @entity13 switched allegiances from @entity16 's salon in @entity17 to vip favourite @entity18 's in @entity21 's @entity20			1
@entity18 is the hairdresser behind @entity23 's amazing locks and his stylists are also said to tend the tresses of @entity26 , and actresses @entity28 and @entity29			1
here @entity30 , @entity18 's artistic director , tells @entity31 the ten secrets of how to get the ' rich girl ' look			1
super-glossy : whether worn up or down , @entity13 's hair always looked pristine during the recent royal tour of @entity38 and @entity39 a good cut is the essential foundation to natural , glossy , highend hair			1
if you can afford it , ' @entity43 ' is the best haircut in the world			0
developed 20 years ago by @entity18 , today it costs from £ 120 to £ 1,000 , and takes anything from an hour to almost a whole day			0
it 's about maximising a client 's natural beauty by considering how each strand of hair falls			1
it takes into account the hair 's texture , thickness , glossiness , length , colour , cut and density			1
i trained for two and a half years to master it			0
first we shampoo and condition , then give a moisturising treatment and head massage			0
to cut the hair we use patented scissors that were designed by @entity18 and are hand - made in @entity72			1
they have little gaps cut into the bottom blade so most of it is blunt - they cut only 8 per cent of the hair at a time , creating delicate , soft lines for an ultra-feminine look			1
we use three cutting techniques for ' @entity43 '			0
no worries on a windy day : the @entity83 ' hair always falls into place thanks to the ' the method ' cutting technique one is called ' inserire ' ( @entity72 for ' enter ' ) , which involves carving layers into small sections of hair that wo n't be visible when the cut is finished but add body and movement			1
then there 's ' uscita ' ( ' exit ' ) , which means slicing fingers through hair to guide the scissors			1
lastly there 's ' uscita ruotare ' ( ' rotating exit ' ) , which involves turning the hair in your fingers , at a precise angle , for a more accurate cut			1
once the cut is finished the hair is blow - dried and styled , though it will look fine if left to air - dry			1
the two shades rule the closer you keep your hair to its natural colour , the better and glossier it is			1
dye it too light or dark and you ruin the follicles , which dry out and break during brushing			0
volume : use vegetable dye for shiny hair like @entity13 's this is because stronger chemicals are needed to make more dramatic colour changes			1
as a rule , ask your hairdresser to go only two shades lighter or darker than your natural hue			0
fair complexions can get away with a shade or two lighter than this			0
the only way to cover grey hair is with permanent colour , but be regimented with its upkeep			1
refreshing roots can be necessary every ten days			0
we do n't do hair extensions except by special request			1
i almost always advise against them			0
they are so bad for hair , weakening and pulling the follicles and leading to hair damage and loss			1
clipped - in extensions ( which are cheaper ) add less weight and drag marginally less than glue - ins but damage the hair as you take them in and out			1
at a push , clip - ins are slightly more acceptable for your hair 's health - but only as a one - off for a special occasion			1
with the right cut you should sidestep the need for these altogether , and look naturally classier			0
if you 're considering highlights , ask for @entity162 ( from the @entity163 ' to sweep ' ) for extra depth and dimension			0
these are freestyle , hand - painted highlights which make hair look naturally sun - kissed and need less maintenance than more formulaic highlights ( where traditional foiling or a colour cap is used ) or solid block colour			1
they can last for up to four months before needing a touch - up			0
after washing hair at home , lightly towel dry so it is still 80 per cent wet			1
this is when it is most manageable and you will be able to see the natural fall , weight and curl of your hair			1
drying soaking wet hair takes longer and makes it harder to style			2
next , massage a volumising spray , foam or cream in at the roots with your fingers for height and texture			0
a mousse is best for fine , thin hair			2
radial bristle brushes are the softest : they wo n't pull and achieve bounce , movement and body best under the dryer ( @entity205 bristles radial hairbrush , £ 7.50 , @entity207 )			0
a paddle brush is best if you want straight hair			2
to finish , mist a spray of hair oil ( @entity215 hair oil , £ 21.05 , salonskincare.co.uk ) a short distance from the head while the hair is still damp			2
no budget buys : do n't skimp on shampoo if you want ' rich girl hair ' @entity223 protection : be careful of too hot thongs when styling hair and finish with a spray of hair oil some things you can skimp on , some you ca n't			2
a top - quality shampoo and conditioner is essential for luxurious , glossy locks			0
unfortunately , supermarket own brands tend to turn hair ashen , with ingredients such as sulfates and sodium chloride stripping protective oils from the hair			2
the best shampoo and conditioner comes from the @entity243 sleek smoothing range ( £ 19 , lookfantastic.com ) , which delivers the best shine and volume i 've ever come across			0
leave conditioner on for as long as possible so the maximum amount of protein - the natural building blocks of hair - can be absorbed to moisturise and smoothe			2
leaving conditioner on for ten minutes is vital if you have coloured or thinning hair , as it helps to boost volume and shape			2
another trick is to shampoo , condition , then very lightly shampoo again to remove product build - up			0
this improves fine hair , which gets easily weighed down with conditioning masks and will look brighter and bouncier after drying			2
spring - clean your hair with a vegetable dye			2
these are natural colourants that are n't permanent			0
they are richly conditioning , coating each strand like a varnish rather than penetrating the cuticle			0
they will temporarily thicken the hair , adding volume and bounce and boosting shine			2
the colour will fade over time but they are a good quick fix , and results can last for up to six shampoos			0
it 's tasty too ! @entity287 also approves of his mother 's long hair we often use a moisturising hair mask on clients before cutting			1
a reviving hair treatment you can do at home i s @entity298 , which comes with little ' caviar ' pearls for massaging into the scalp and a conditioning mask full of vitamin a and @entity304 , for stimulating hair growth and moisturising the scalp			2
leave it on for 15 minutes after shampooing , then rinse for glossy hair and a nourished , hydrated scalp ( £ 64 , @entity310 , one kit contains ten applications )			2
your tongs , straighteners and curlers heat up to a maximum of 220c			0
that 's hotter than you roast a chicken at , so think what it 's doing to your hair ! look on the packaging to see how hot your gadgets can get			1
ideally set them to a medium heat setting - say , 180c - and use tongs sparingly			0
the thicker and coarser your hair , the higher temperature you 'll need			0
protect hair before styling with a product such as @entity332 ( £ 16.50 , aveda.co			0
this is essential whatever your hair type .			0
