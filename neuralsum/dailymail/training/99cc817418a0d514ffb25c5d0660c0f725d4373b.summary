a bizarre worm - like animal that lived 505 million years ago has been definitively categorised on the ‘ @entity2 ’ by scientists			1
known as @entity4 the creature has legs , spikes , a head and a tail , and has been linked with a group of modern animals for the first time			1
it had once been considered an ‘ evolutionary misfit ’ but now researchers have found an important link with modern velvet worms , which live in tropical forests			1
a bizarre creature that existed 505 million years ago has been classified by scientists			2
known as @entity4 ( artist 's impression shown ) , the worm - like creature with legs , spikes and a head difficult to distinguish from its tail has found its place in the evolutionary ' @entity2 ' the discovery published in the journal @entity31 was made by scientists at the @entity33			1
the @entity35 explosion , or @entity35 radiation , was the relatively rapid appearance , around 530 million years ago , of most major animal phyla , as demonstrated in the fossil record			0
before about 580 million years ago , most organisms were simple , composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies			0
over the following 70 or 80 million years , the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude ( as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species ) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today			0
it ended with the cambrian - ordovician extinction event , approximately 488 million years ago			0
the similarity of @entity4 to other contemporary ' legged worms ' , collectively known as lobopodians , has been very controversial			2
this is because a lack of clear characteristics linking them to each other or to modern animals has made it difficult to determine their evolutionary home			0
what is more , early interpretations of @entity4 , which was first identified in the 1970s , placed it both backwards and upside - down			2
the spines along the creature 's back were originally thought to be legs , its legs were thought to be tentacles along its back , and its head was mistaken for its tail			1
@entity4 lived approximately 505 million years ago during the @entity81 , a period of rapid evolution when most major animal groups first appear in the fossil record			2
these particular fossils come from the @entity86 in @entity88 's @entity87 , one of the richest @entity35 fossil deposits in the world			0
looking like something from science fiction , @entity4 ( illustration shown ) had a row of rigid spines along its back , and seven or eight pairs of legs ending in claws			0
the animals were between 0.2 and 1.4 inches ( five and 35 millimetres ) in length , and lived on the floor of the @entity35 oceans which way is the right way ? initially scientists had thought that the creature was supposed to be the other way up , with the spikes acting as the legs and the ' legs ' actually being tentacles , but now they think they were looking at it upside down ( illustration shown ) a new study of the creature 's claws revealed an organisation very close to those of modern velvet worms , where layers of cuticle ( a hard substance similar to fingernails ) are stacked one inside the other , like @entity128 nesting dolls			1
the same nesting structure can also be seen in the jaws of velvet worms , which are no more than legs modified for chewing			1
' it 's often thought that modern animal groups arose fully formed during the @entity81 , ' said dr @entity135 of the @entity136 of @entity137 , the paper 's lead author			0
' but evolution is a gradual process : today 's complex anatomies emerged step by step , one feature at a time			0
' by deciphering " in - between " fossils like @entity4 , we can determine how different animal groups built up their modern body plans			1
' @entity4 had once been considered an ‘ evolutionary misfit ’ but now researchers have found an important link with modern velvet worms , which live in tropical forests			1
pictured here is a stock photo of a velvet worm in @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 these particular fossils of @entity4 come from the @entity86 in @entity88 's @entity87 , one of the richest @entity35 fossil deposits in the world			1
pictured is a specimen of @entity4 on display in the @entity168 , @entity169 with its spikes clearly visible while @entity4 had been suspected to be an ancestor of velvet worms , definitive characteristics linking them together had been hard to come by , and their claws had never been studied in detail			1
through analysing both the prehistoric and living creatures , the researchers found that claws were the connection joining them together			0
cambrian fossils continue to produce new information on origins of complex animals , and the use of high - end imaging techniques and data on living organisms further allows researchers to untangle the enigmatic evolution of earliest creatures			0
' an exciting outcome of this study is that it turns our current understanding of the evolutionary tree of arthropods - the group including spiders , insects and crustaceans - upside down , ' said dr @entity202 , the paper 's co-author			2
' most gene - based studies suggest that arthropods and velvet worms are closely related to each other ; however , our results indicate that arthropods are actually closer to water bears , or tardigrades , a group of hardy microscopic animals best known for being able to survive the vacuum of space and sub-zero temperatures - leaving velvet worms as distant cousins			2
' and dr @entity135 added : ' the peculiar claws of @entity4 are a smoking gun that solve a long and heated debate in evolutionary biology , and may even help to decipher other problematic @entity35 critters			0

researchers at the @entity33 have classified an *ancient* worm
known as @entity4 sparsa the creature had legs , spikes , a head and tail
scientists had been baffled as to where it fit on the evolutionary ' @entity2 '
but a study says the odd - looking creature is linked to modern velvet worms
animal is so bizarre that scientists once thought fossils were upside down
