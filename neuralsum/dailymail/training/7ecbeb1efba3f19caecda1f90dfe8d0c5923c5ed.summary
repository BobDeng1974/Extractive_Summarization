by @entity0 for @entity1 a group who violently beat two gay men in @entity6 's city center last week might have finally been tracked down thanks to internet sleuths determined to bring them to justice			1
after police officers shared surveillance footage on monday showing a group of clean - cut men and women believed to be behind the attack , @entity11 users got to work tracking them down			1
the sleuths , including former @entity21 castmate @entity20 and an anonymous @entity23 man , eventually ided the group using @entity25 and @entity11 and called the cops , @entity18 reported			1
the attack unfolded after the two victims , aged 26 and 28 , were walking in @entity29 on september 11 and were approached by the group , who asked if they were boyfriends , police said			1
' and i said " yes this is my f'ing boyfriend " ... three guys just started pummeling me and knocked me to the ground			0
' the group then allegedly made ' disparaging remarks ' about gay people before launching a violent attack on the two men - kicking them in the head , chest and face			1
one of the victims was only released from hospital on monday and will need his jaw wired shut for eight weeks			2
the other suffered bone fractures and cuts to his face			0
the group also allegedly stole one of their bags			0
on monday - with no arrests made - police released surveillance footage of the suspects and offered a $ 10,000 reward for any information			1
crackdown : @entity20 , a former @entity21 star , later tweeted this composite image showing the surveillance footage and an image ( bottom right ) of the group apparently out earlier that night close up : the image , which he got from ' @entity89 ' , shows some of the group wearing similar clothing to that in the footage			1
after sharing the image , other @entity11 users ided the restaurant after seeing the footage , @entity97 castmate @entity20 tweeted an image apparently showing the group enjoying a night out at a restaurant before the attack			1
the image shows the large group grinning for the camera , with some clothes appearing similar to those worn by the suspects in the surveillance footage			1
@entity20 explained that he had been given the photo from ' @entity89 ' , but did not know where it had been taken			2
then ' @entity112 ' , another @entity11 user living in @entity113 , retweeted the photo - and his followers immediately started pointing out that the stone walls and chandeliers looked as if they were from @entity118 , a restaurant on 16th street			2
sleuth : another @entity11 user , @entity112 , said he had checked the restaurant 's @entity122 ( @entity124 ) and noticed some had ' checked in '			2
he then matched up the group photo with their profile pictures , he said thankful : police officer @entity128 thanked the sleuths and said their work was priceless ongoing search : @entity128 added on his @entity11 account that the investigation was still underway speaking to @entity135 , the restaurant confirmed that they had had a large group on the night of the attack - but that they had thrown away that night 's reservation sheet , so could not identify them			1
good work : @entity140 , a @entity21 of @entity23 cast member , helped with the online sleuthing @entity112 then took over the sleuthing by going to the restaurant 's @entity25 page and seeing who had ' checked in ' on their @entity25 profiles while there			1
he tweeted that he had found people who checked in on the night of the attack and managed to match up people in the photos with their profile pictures			2
he added that some of their @entity25 pages were ' filled with gay slurs '			0
the unidentified sleuth then called police - who thanked him in a series of their own tweets			0
' this is what makes my job easy , ' @entity6 police officer @entity128 tweeted			0
' sure , it 's up to me to make the arrest but we are all in this together			0
' this is how @entity11 is supposed to work for cops			0
i will take a couple thousand @entity11 detectives over any one real detective any day			0
' but he pointed out that no arrests have yet been made and that detectives continue to investigate			0
@entity178 reported that some of the suspects had retained lawyers , who were calling the police to make arrangements , perhaps to surrender			0
there had been a $ 10,000 reward for catching the thugs , and if the sleuth , @entity112 , gets it , he will give half of it to @entity192 charities , he tweeted			0
