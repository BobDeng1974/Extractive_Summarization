@entity0 has rubbished the formation of a task force to examine ways of improving the dire recent run of the @entity7 @entity6 team , urging his country to appoint @entity9 or @entity10 as player - captain			1
@entity0 , winner of the 1995 @entity12 and 1991 @entity13 , has never played in the biennial team event but said it was ' not rocket science ' to work out why @entity16 had won eight of the last 10 editions			2
' i do n't know where they are going with a task force , ' the 48 - year - old said after posting a three - under - par 69 in the opening round of the Â£ 4.5million @entity24 on thursday			2
@entity10 ( centre ) was part of the @entity7 team which were easily beaten at @entity28 @entity9 should be considered as a player - captain at @entity30 in 2016 , says @entity0 ' they should just go ahead and pick a captain			1
my view is that @entity10 should be the next captain and play at @entity30			0
' he knows everything about the @entity6 so maybe it should be him or @entity9 who should be the next captain			2
we 've had playing captains over the years so why not in 2016 ? '			0
the @entity39 announced the formation of the task force , which includes @entity10 and @entity9 , after @entity43 's side lost to @entity44 's @entity16 by 16 - 1/2 points to 11 - 1/2 in @entity46 in september			1
the job of the 11 - man group is to examine ' the entire @entity6 process ' including the selection of the captain and the points qualifying system			2
' if they picked @entity10 he would have full team respect , ' said @entity0			0
' it 's not rocket science why the @entity16 team has been winning , it does n't need a task force to work it out			1
' @entity44 ( third right ) and @entity16 celebrate their big win in @entity46 in september @entity0 is a two - time major winner but the @entity7 big hitter has never played in the @entity6 @entity10 launched a stinging attack on captain @entity43 's performance at @entity28 , saying he was particularly frustrated at how little input the players had behind the scenes that week			1
@entity71 , @entity16 's triumphant @entity6 skipper in @entity72 in 2010 , has also criticised the setting up of the task force			1
' i do n't think it 's necessary , ' said the 51 - year - old @entity77			0
' i just see someone getting the team to play as a team			0
' the last @entity6 was a lot closer than you would imagine			0
there were four matches on the last day at @entity28 that went the @entity16 way and might not have done - and it would have changed the whole scene			0

@entity0 has *called* on @entity10 to be next @entity7 @entity6 captain
@entity0 says either @entity10 or @entity9 could get *top* job
scrap task force appointed to s*top* run of @entity7 **defeat*s* , @entity0 said
