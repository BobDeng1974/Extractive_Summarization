it hit a score of 88 on review - aggregator site @entity26 - the highest for any online ' world ' game this year players can opt to play as lightsaber - wielding @entity40 or evil sith - you ca n't play as famous characters such as @entity23 , but a few famous faces crop up throughout the game ' @entity47 ' games such as @entity9 allow tens of thousands of players to adventure together - battling monsters together or battling one another to become more powerful many games have attempted the feat - including several with well - known characters such as @entity52 - but the @entity9 is hotly tipped to do it , thanks to the familiar @entity55 , a rumoured Â£ 100 - million - plus budget , and the fact that @entity16 subscribers seem to be tiring of the game 's fantasy world , with two million leaving in the past year			1
the game officially launched on december 20			0
for gamers , it 's easily the biggest launch in a genre that 's been ruled single - handedly by @entity16 for more than five years			2
it 's finally happening , ' said game site @entity68 last week			0
the game 's maker , @entity33 , was once the biggest game publisher in the world , but lost ground to rival @entity75 when @entity75 acquired @entity76 , makers of @entity0 in 2008			1

the evil @entity101 holds court in the highly anticipated @entity104 title @entity9			0
gamers will play ' together ' in an online world based on @entity9 @entity107 , president of @entity33 , said to @entity108 , ' i wish it was n't so expensive			1
' the business model where gamers pay for discs , then pay to subscribe , is also under threat			2
many games , such as @entity118 's @entity117 , have switched to a ' free to play ' system similar to @entity121 games , where the game itself is free , but users pay to upgrade their character with powerful items or new outfits			2
