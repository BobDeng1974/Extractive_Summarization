cleaning up : @entity0 , who poses with his cordless invention the @entity2 , is the new @entity3 rumour has it that it ’s practically impossible to get into the @entity3 headquarters without myriad levels of security clearance			1
so secretive has the high - powered ( in every sense ) world of vacuum cleaners become that fear of espionage is rife			1
@entity3 employees must use a fingerprint scanner to enter the building and , even then , access to most research areas is only for a select few			1
so when the man tipped as the next @entity3 leaps in front of me as i reach for a door handle inside his domestic appliance empire , it ’s not a surprise			1
‘ i ’ll need to get that , ’ says @entity0			1
of course , he will			2
are we talking fingerprints here , too ? @entity30 scanning ? am i going to be denied access until i swear not to divulge suction secrets to the @entity33 ? well , no. it ’s turns out we are just talking a temperamental door			2
‘ it ’s a bit stiff , ’ he says cheerily , yanking it open			0
welcome to the surprisingly low - tech world of @entity2 , the little vacuum cleaner company that is taking on the big boys of dust - busting			1
have you even heard of @entity2 ? well , it is short for @entity46 , a name which even mr @entity0 , 45 , admits does n’t have the pizazz of @entity3			1
‘ it ’s not a very good name , is it ? ’ he frowns			0
‘ but i could n’t think of anything			0
people do n’t know how to pronounce it			0
our customers phone up and say “ i need a battery for my @entity59 ”			0
’ all of which makes the success of @entity2 ’s flagship product , a lightweight cordless vacuum cleaner called the @entity64 , even more unlikely			1
the @entity64 may look unprepossessing , and its inventor admits that it was designed with the elderly market in mind			1
‘ the first customers were in the over- 80 age bracket , ’ he nods			0
but , as unlikely as it sounds , this machine has been , er , wiping the floor with the opposition with 32,000 of them flying off the shelves every month			1
and their fans love them			0
not least because of their clever internal compression technology which crunches all the dirt into solid little bales which you simply tip out into the bin			0
the bales are made - in rather revolutionary fashion - just a few centimetres from where the dust and dirt enters the machine , rather than having to travel through reams of tubing			2
the absence of both bag and miles of tubes makes for a superlight machine too			0
@entity0 proudly shows how the @entity64 can be carried with just one finger			1
he is , however , reluctant to reveal how he makes the bales of dirt , concerned as he is about competitors copying his technology			0
in the year to date , he says , the @entity64 has outsold every rival cordless product			1
@entity2 is now making lavish claims about it being the @entity105 ’s best - selling vacuum cleaner by value - hotly disputed by @entity3 , of course			1
sir @entity3 - the man who changed the face of the entire industry - is certainly familiar with @entity2			1
last year , his company took the extraordinary step of taking full page adverts in national newspapers , claiming that @entity3 ’s sleek ( and much sexier , it has to be said ) cordless model , the @entity115 , boasted ten times as much suction as the @entity64			1
it was akin to @entity118 inviting @entity119 to a duel			0
@entity3 was also quick to pounce when @entity2 insisted that their product was superior			1
it complained to @entity124 , which upheld eight of the nine complaints and forced @entity2 to change some wording on its adverts			1
‘ maybe we were a bit naïve about the wording			0
it never occurred to us that every word would be scrutinised by teams of lawyers			0
’ vacuum cleaning companies have teams of lawyers ? ‘ oh yes , @entity3 have about 20 , 17 in house			1
’ and how many do you have ? ‘ none			0
’ although the company launched in 2001 , it ’s only in the past three years that @entity2 has come out of the shadows			1
last year it had a £ 20million turnover			0
next year ’s predicted turnover , says mr @entity0 , is £ 40million			1
so can you smell the success at company @entity153 yet ? frankly , no. all you can smell is manure because @entity2 is situated on a farm near the village of @entity158 in @entity159			1
fifty cows stare at me as i pick my way across the yard			0
my mucky shoes are greeted with whoops of delight when i get inside , however			2
lightweight : the @entity64 is so light it can be lifted with a single finger - a fact of which mr @entity0 is undeniably proud ‘ we love muck			1
one of the advantages of being out in the country is that people are always treading in some sort of goo , ’ says mr @entity0 , getting down on the floor to examine exactly what type of dirt it is ( there are infinite varieties )			1
obviously , they do pay people to tread muck professionally			0
at the back of one barn is a scene which could have come straight from a @entity191 cartoon			0
three menacing - looking vacuum cleaners are held in place over a revolving conveyor belt of carpet to test their performance			1
they turn on automatically for 14 ½ minutes , rest for 30 seconds , then turn themselves on again			0
all day and all night			0
@entity0 looks at them as one would gambolling lambs			1
@entity2 still feels very much like the sort of business that was started in someone ’s garage - which it was			1
even now the products are likely to be tested by @entity0 asking his mother ’s friends to ‘ give them a whirl ’			1
‘ yeah , you can have all the lab testing in the world , but you ca n’t beat trying a prototype out in someone ’s home , with real dirt and dogs and children and mess			0
’ so his home - he has four young kids - is presumably spotless ? ‘ that ’s the trouble			2
i test them so much we do n’t have enough dirt ! you need a few days build - up			2
we have n’t got a dog , unfortunately , so i ’ve been known to stop people walking by my house with their dog to say “ can i come and clean your house ? ” ‘ most people like it - once i ’ve explained			2
they do n’t think i ’m barmy , no , not really			0
i mean i do n’t sneak into their houses at night , doing guerrilla cleaning			0
’ do n’t be fooled , though			0
this is not someone who has stumbled into success			0
@entity0 ’s rise has been methodical and determined			1
he was n’t born with a burning desire to design vacuum cleaners			2
he left school with just two o - levels and got a job with leading vacuum maker @entity248 , which was where his love affair with appliances started			1
‘ i went in at the lowest level			0
it was my job to set up the lab for testing , get the dirt and spread it around , then clear up afterwards			2
i ’d watch the engineers and think “ i want to do that ”			0
’ he progressed up the company , first getting his hands on ‘ actual exciting machines ’ , then becoming involved in the design process			2
powerful : @entity2 's range has prompted a vigorous response from industry giants @entity3 after 12 years , he was running the engineering department , and studying for an @entity267 degree in his spare time			1
‘ i think quite early on i knew that one day i ’d go out on my own			0
i did have big ideas that were n’t necessarily wanted			2
i wanted to go down the cordless route , but they were n’t interested			2
’ he was at @entity248 , at a lowly level , circa 1993 , when @entity3 burst onto the scene			2
there was a bit of hero worship going on there			0
‘ to give him credit , @entity3 completely transformed the industry			1
people like me see him as a father figure			0
it has been said that @entity3 made vacuum cleaners sexy			1
‘ i do n’t know about that , but he certainly made them trendy			0
’ @entity3 say they have ‘ very simply illustrated the difference between our technology and @entity2 ’s ’ and that ‘ they are the market leader in cordless vacuum cleaners ’			1
sadly , the home - spun appeal of @entity2 may not last			1
plans are in place for a move to new custom - built premises			2
' possible ' : mr @entity0 has even floated the return of the vacuum bag in the near future for @entity2 he likes to cite @entity2 as a great @entity105 success story , but the reality is that his cleaners are produced in @entity306 , as per the industry standard			1
‘ the fact is that you just ca n’t do it here and be cost - effective			2
i could n’t have started a production line in the @entity105			0
it would have cost me a quarter of a million pounds			0
there was no way i had that amount of money			0
' in @entity306 , i did it for £ 60,000			0
obviously the dream would be to bring production over here , but realistically , it ca n’t happen soon			0
’ so what innovations are we going to see over the next few years in the vacuum cleaning world ? the word from @entity3 is that robots are the @entity323			1
@entity0 is more , well , grey , about what is to come			2
cordless is the future , he believes but he hints that his company is also looking into bringing back the vacuum cleaner bag - the very thing @entity3 famously ditched			1
is n’t that going backwards ? ‘ no , the thing is that bag worked , it was getting hold of the bags that was the issue			0
’ so , we ’ve gone from bagless to cordless , but now we may be heading into bagged - and - cordless territory ? ‘ i ca n’t say too much but it ’s possible			2
’ and what about the true holy grail of vacuums - the one that picks the @entity345 out of the damn machine itself , then makes a nice cup of tea and gets on with the ironing ? ‘ ah , we are working on that one , ’ he says			2
‘ but it may be a while			0

@entity0 developed @entity2 vacuum empire from his mucky farmhouse
centred around his cordless @entity64 cleaner , which sells 32,000 a month
mr @entity0 and his company have gone **toe** - to - **toe** with industry giants @entity3
but the company still has a *homepsun* feel - though its set for big future
