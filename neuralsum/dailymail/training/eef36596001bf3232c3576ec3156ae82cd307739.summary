@entity1 manager @entity0 will head straight into his new @entity3 role after the @entity4 and his settling - in period has been made more straightforward after he bought a house in nearby @entity7			1
while @entity8 has been away at the @entity4 in @entity9 managing his native @entity10 , he has left domestic matters in the hands of his wife @entity13 , who has selected a property for the family			1
@entity8 ’s wife has been spotted house - hunting in the @entity19 area in recent weeks and @entity20 understands that the @entity21 ’ put down a deposit on a property around ten days ago			1

instead , he will go into his role at @entity3 within just a couple of days			0
the @entity48 has been in charge of the @entity10 for the @entity4 in @entity9 but despite the intense nature of the tournament , it is understood that @entity8 has informed @entity1 officials that he will not require a break , even if @entity10 reach the final of the competition on july 13			0
@entity1 fly out to the @entity63 for their pre-season tour on july 17 but @entity8 would not return to @entity65 until july 15 if his team were to compete in the final of the @entity4 in @entity9			0
neighbour : @entity8 will be living near the recently returned @entity45 proximity : as well as his new no 1 keeper @entity46 it could mean that the @entity48 has less than 48 hours between leaving @entity70 and assuming full responsibilities as manager of @entity1			1
there is also the possibility that @entity1 will present @entity0 in a press conference before the club head off to the @entity63 for glamour games against @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , meaning that the 62 - year - old could have an exhausting schedule lying in wait			0

@entity8 , meanwhile , has been in constant discussions with executive vice-chairman @entity90 during his involvement with the @entity4 and he is understood to be delighted with the progress @entity1 have made in the transfer window , after the club this week sealed the signings of midfielder @entity96 and defender @entity97			0

@entity8 had initially expected to be without the club ’s @entity110 stars for the majority of the trip as it is normal practice for @entity4 players to be given a four - week break following their elimination from the tournament			2
video @entity97 signs for @entity1 additions : @entity1 have already added @entity96 and @entity97 to the squad allies : @entity8 with @entity122 in training however , @entity8 will now have a chance to meet the majority of his squad far earlier as the players have been informed that they must be ready to play against @entity79 in the second game of the tour in @entity130 on july 26			0
despite @entity10 ’s involvement in the latter stages of the @entity4 , striker @entity122 is understood to be keen to head out on the pre-season tour to be alongside close ally @entity8			2
however , it is expected that he will be encouraged to take a proper break to recharge his batteries ahead of the new season			0
