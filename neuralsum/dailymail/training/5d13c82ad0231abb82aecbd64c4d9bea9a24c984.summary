by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 16:28 est , 14 january 2014 an eight - year - old girl has formed an unlikely friendship - with a coyote			1
@entity5 thinks nothing about nuzzling up to the animal , called @entity8 , and even dozes off with him on her bed			1
she 's even taken to howling with him during the evenings			2
@entity8 has been a treasured member of the family since being rescued by @entity5 's dad , @entity14 , three years ago			1
@entity8 enjoys sprawling up with @entity5 , 8 , on the grade schooler 's bed while she does her homework in @entity18 , @entity19 bed alert : @entity8 snoozes peacefully while @entity5 reads friends : @entity8 sniffs @entity5 at their home @entity8 the @entity23 seen with another dog in @entity18 today he 's thought to be just one of two coyotes in the @entity27 that have become domesticated after being born in the wild			1
and at the @entity5 farm , near @entity18 , @entity19 , he 's treated just like a dog - sitting by the fire in the winter , going for walks on a lead and even playing fetch with a tennis ball			1
he 's got his own comfy chair and enjoys a diet of venison and fried eggs			2
he even has to have his meat cooked - because he wo n't eat it raw			2
it 's a picture of domestic bliss			0
let 's just hope he does n't spot a roadrunner ... coyotes are a wild species of canine found throughout @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity23 is a @entity53 @entity52 word with origins in the @entity55 ' which means trickster			0
they live as far south as @entity57 and in such cold climates as @entity59			0
@entity8 is an exceptional coyote since his species is incredibly hard to domesticate unless raised from an early age			1
even then , the coyote 's wild nature usually comes out around puberty			1
while many species have become threatened with human encroachment , coyotes have actually prospered and become more populous			0
they are often seen living near humans and feeding off of garbage			0
coyotes subsist off a variety of foods from deer to insects and other invertebrates			0
like other canines , coyotes live in packs but actually hunt in pairs			0
for the most part , they are n't a threat to humans , but attacks have been on the rise in @entity88			2
