by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:39 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:51 est , 12 december 2013 it 's certainly a little more original than claiming that the dog ate your homework			2
still , police were less than impressed when they were first told that a van failed to display a proper tax disc because a snail had nibbled away at it			1
luckily , mechanic @entity12 and his father @entity13 provided undeniable photographic evidence – and police waived the £ 100 fine			1
a motorist was spared a fine for a missing car tax disc after photographs proved it had been eaten by a snail @entity12 was handed the £ 100 penalty notice after failing to display the certificate in a van he picked up they even jokingly suggested the men could ‘ interrogate the offender , preferably with a teaspoon of salt ’			1
the insatiable snail slid into the white @entity31 while it was broken down , giving it time to get to work on the tempting tax disc			2
when @entity12 , 33 , picked the van up in order to repair it , he found a penalty notice for the ruined disc			1
but on closer inspection he realised the hungry mollusc was to blame			2
so mr @entity12 ’s father @entity13 , who helps out at his son ’s garage , set about contesting the fine			1
the 70 - year - old said : ‘ it ’s almost unbelievable			0
i had a bit of a chuckle as i just could n’t believe what i saw			0
‘ i think snails like glue and ink so maybe that ’s why it ate the disc			0
‘ it was very much a “ dog ate my homework ” moment , but we still had the penalty notice to deal with			1
’ @entity60 , 70 , said : ' it 's almost unbelievable			0
i had a bit of a chuckle as i just could n't believe what i saw ' the van ’s owner had left it in the @entity69 ’s care , so they felt it was their duty to either pay up – or persuade police that no one was at fault			1
@entity60 said : ‘ we explained the situation but [ police ] were n’t too keen to see the evidence			2
‘ they said it was still an offence as the disc was not properly displayed			0
‘ as it had been partially eaten by the snail , it only said “ august ” and you could n’t see the year			0
‘ but we knew for a fact the customer had taxed the vehicle			0
’ he wrote to the police to state his case – and this time included photos of the greedy snail			2
mr @entity12 , of @entity94 , in @entity95 , @entity96 , said : ‘ we felt it was unjust			1
we tried to make the letter light - hearted but also explain that this all happened by chance			0
’ luckily , @entity101 and @entity102 agreed , replying : ‘ after consideration of all the facts i have decided to excuse payment of the fixed penalty			1
‘ please feel free to interrogate the offender , preferably with a teaspoon of salt			1
’ sadly , the snail died after his taxing meal			0
snails often eat paper , which is made up of plant fibres , and are a common pest in postboxes , where they eat both letters and envelope glue , according to @entity123			0
in last week ’s @entity125 , chancellor @entity124 said tax discs will be scrapped next year and replaced with an electronic system .			0
