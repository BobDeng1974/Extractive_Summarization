by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 18 may 2012 an aspiring model who used stolen credit cards to pay for expensive cosmetic surgery to bolster her fledgling career walked free from court today			1
@entity6 , 23 , splashed £ 6,850 on liposuction and lip enhancements with around £ 4,000 coming from stolen card details she was given by a man she met in a nightclub			1
@entity6 , who is now two months pregnant , told the court she ‘ dreamed of being a model ’ and claimed she had no idea the card details she used were stolen			1
convicted : @entity6 , 23 , seen arriving at @entity18 during her five - day trial , used stolen credit cards to pay for cosmetic surgery in an attempt to improve her prospects of making it as a model she also alleged that the surgery had left her with a burnt arm and was considering legal action			1
prosecutors said she was part of a plot with the man she said she knew only as ' @entity36 ' to defraud the dr @entity37 and @entity39 , on @entity40 , central @entity41			0
the pair were said to have repeatedly called the surgery where @entity6 paid a £ 500 deposit to pay the balance , with around £ 4,000 coming from the stolen cards			1
during the trial , jurors heard @entity6 booked her treatment and paid a £ 500 deposit before paying the rest over the phone using a variety of cards			2
@entity6 and ' @entity36 ' called the surgery 14 times between february 21 and february 23 last year using both legitimate and fraudulent cards to pay off the balance			2
the clinic was later informed that the card payments were fraudulent , leaving them out of pocket			0
when asked by her legal team if she had ‘ any reason to doubt ’ that the cards belonged to ' @entity36 ’ she replied : ‘ no ’			0
she described @entity36 as ‘ very flashy ’ and said when she first met him in a club he had been ‘ trying to get a lot of attention buying bottles of champagne costing over £ 200 ’			0
spared jail : @entity6 was not ordered to pay legal costs and compensation because her conviction at @entity18 means she is likely to lose her job and be unable to afford the fines @entity6 said : ‘ he offered to pay so he would then contact the clinic and pay the full amount			1
’ she insisted she believed the card did belong to ‘ @entity36 ’ , who later told @entity6 he was too busy to make the payments and asked her to try for him and supplied the details			2
the judge , mr recorder @entity88 , told her : ‘ you made a series of false representations to dr @entity37 and @entity39 by using a series of eight cards , many of which did not belong to you			0
‘ this was a very strange case in many ways			0
‘ it struck me that it was almost inevitable that you would be apprehended as the surgery had your name and the address at which you resided			0
‘ but equally the evidence and the jury ’s verdict that you would have had to have known through the number of cards , the way they were used , the constant rejections and re-submissions that what you were doing was dishonest cause it just could not have been operated in any other fashion			0
’ the former @entity116 and @entity118 model , of @entity119 , southwest @entity41 , had denied four counts of fraud , was convicted by a jury of four counts of fraud after a five day trial in april			1
@entity6 was convicted and given a 12 month community order and told to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work			1
an application for £ 4,000 in compensation and a contribution of £ 1,875 towards prosecution costs was reject on the grounds @entity6 ’s conviction would see her lose her job and she would have no money to pay			2
‘ i feel it would be wrong in the circumstance to impose any such order , ’ said the judge			0
prosecutor @entity141 said today : ‘ the four convictions for fraud relate to the use of credit cards in order to pay for cosmetic procedures which she was not entitled to use			2
