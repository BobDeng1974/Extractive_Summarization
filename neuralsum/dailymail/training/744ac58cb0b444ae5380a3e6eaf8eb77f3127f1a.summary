@entity0 have tabled an opening bid of around £ 17million for @entity3 ’s unsettled centre - back @entity4 , according to reports in @entity6			1
the 27 - year - old @entity7 international is one of two alternatives @entity0 have lined up if they decide against pursuing first - choice target @entity11 from @entity13			1
and it appears the deal has progressed in the past 48 hours with reports that the @entity17 champions have discussed personal terms with @entity4 before making an initial approach to his club			2
head boy : @entity0 have reportedly tabled a bid for @entity3 defender @entity4 ( centre ) earlier this week the player hit out at @entity3 ’s pay increase offer of £ 2.5m - a - year , with sources claiming that it is £ 1m - a - year less than he has been promised at @entity0			1
@entity4 has accused the @entity6 of reneging on an agreement made when he signed from @entity30 for £ 10.5m last summer that guaranteed him a significant pay rise if @entity3 qualified for the @entity33			1
@entity34 and @entity35 have also been linked with @entity4 who has refused to rule out a move despite having four years left on his current deal			0
first choice : @entity11 is also on @entity0 's wanted list ‘ @entity3 have not kept their promises , ’ he said earlier this week			1
‘ they had told me that they would make me a new contract offer if i had a great season			1
‘ but i have received an unacceptable proposal , less than € 3m - per - season			0
i replied that i would not sign it			0
‘ i 'm in love with @entity46 , i ’m fine here but my mistake was to be too correct with the club and too honest			0
undecided : @entity4 has said he could leave @entity3 ‘ i never said that i wanted to leave			2
i only said that anyone dreams of teams like @entity52 , @entity35 and @entity0			0
‘ my agent is doing his job , i could leave but i could also stay and finish my career in @entity3			0
but i was disappointed with @entity3 – i deserved more respect			0

@entity0 chairman @entity66 has promised to move quickly on the club ’s targets and @entity69 is known to be on the list of possibilities			2
@entity3 insist he is not for sale and they do not need the money after qualifying for the @entity33 this season on the back of selling @entity76 to @entity77 for £ 30m and @entity78 – the player @entity4 replaced – to @entity80 for £ 27m last summer			2
