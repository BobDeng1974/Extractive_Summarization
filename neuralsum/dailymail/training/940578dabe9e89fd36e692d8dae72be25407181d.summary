by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 the winter games have opened in @entity4 , @entity5 , to the sound of deafening silence			1
the @entity9 debut of slopestyle - a snowboarding event that has competitors performing breathtaking tricks - kicked off today in front of a nearly empty stadium			1
the spectators who did attend were nearly all @entity5 - raising questions over whether security threats , human rights questions and the trickle of @entity4 horror stories will keep the world away from the @entity9			1
there were large pockets of empty seats during portions of men 's and women 's qualifying on thursday , particularly near the beginning and end of the seven - hour session			1
conditions were perfect with sunny skies , warm temperatures and not even the hint of a breeze			0
and , despite controversy after two competitors were injured , on jumps that were deemed ' too dangerous , ' the course was n't to blame , either			1
after days of tweaks , the jumps were tame enough for eight riders to post scores in the 90s - very strong performances			1
thursday 's slopestyle qualifying courses marked the first @entity9 competition has been held before the winter games opening ceremony in 30 years			1
the crowd appeared to be largely @entity5			1
the biggest cheers were reserved for @entity5 @entity67 even though he finished 10th out of 15 riders during his qualifying heat			2
as the competition began , much of the focus had been on athlete safety			0
however , most athletes came away unscathed at the @entity75			0
all eyes were on the course following wednesday 's withdrawal of @entity80 @entity79 , citing safety concerns , and the frightening crash that left @entity84 medal hope @entity85 with a broken collarbone			1
but if any of the snowboarders were holding anything back on the sport 's @entity9 debut they did not show it , as they launched themselves spinning through the air to impress the judges			1
@entity96 @entity95 was left clutching his ribs after a heavy fall , and @entity84 's @entity99 had to seek medical attention following a wipeout on her final run in the womens second heat			0
thursday marked the @entity9 debut of the sport - slopestyle - though some of snowboarding 's biggest stars have pulled out after deeming the course ' too dangerous			1
' @entity80 @entity110 is pictured safer ? @entity113 's @entity112 wiped out thursday during the qualifications - though he was not seriously hurt big air : @entity116 of @entity117 grabbed his board during a big jump in the qualifications for the men 's slopestyle competition but overall , competitors were pleased with the course			1
' it 's demanding , but it works			0
it 's not a bad course , ' @entity84 's @entity127 , who slipped in both runs , told @entity1 in the finish zone ' they 're not the most " poppy " jumps - we 're used to getting a little help with our tricks - but you have to do everything on your own here , so i guess that 's the main difference that people are struggling with			2
' @entity127 said that doubts over course safety expressed earlier in the week had been dealt with after organizers trimmed the height of some of the jumps			2
' it 's not dangerous at all , it 's a regular course , ' he said			2
' the jumps are regular size , the rails are good , it 's fine			2
' games officials had been racing to complete preparations in time but as @entity160 's @entity159 took off to give slopestyle its official debut , volunteers were still hammering poles into the ground to secure crash barriers			2
@entity159 was so focused on his run that he was not even aware he was about to make snowboarding history			0
nearly everyone in the stands was @entity5 , according to reports - raising questions about whether the world is willing to come to @entity4 the opening ceremony is not until friday , but the sparse attendance does not bode well for the @entity4 games ' it was pretty cool , i did n't realize until one of the other athletes told me at the top , ' he told reporters			1
' i did n't think about it until the last minute			0
i had fun and it was really good			0
' cheered on by a crowd well short of capacity , the riders grabbed the sport 's @entity9 opportunity with both hands , posing for photographs and signing autographs for fans			2
eight automatic spots in both the men 's and women 's final were up for grabs on thursday , with the second heats delivering the day 's most breathtaking action			0
@entity113 's @entity201 showed no signs of nerves as she put in a sizzling run to score 95.50 to book her place in the final			0
' i was so nervous , i 've never been that nervous in my life before			0
i 'm straight to the finals , that 's the best thing i could wish for , ' she said with a beaming smile			0
' it 's the @entity9 , and back home it 's the first time it ( slopestyle ) is on tv back home , so i knew all my friends were watching			1
' in the second heat of the men 's competition , @entity220 's @entity219 came out on top after a frenzied second run which saw the lead change hands several times			0
the men 's final is on saturday and the women 's the following day .			0
