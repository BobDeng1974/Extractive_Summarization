decades after the last concentration camps of the @entity1 closed their doors , many guards who were in charge of overseeing them are now being tried for suspected war crimes			2
to secure convictions , prosecutors are using a mixture of testimonies and archived paperwork alongside modern techniques , including 3d modelling			2
one model of the iconic @entity15 in @entity16 could even reveal exactly how much the guards were aware of during their time at the death camps , although images of this are yet to be released to the public			1
a @entity24 prosecutor built a 3d virtual model of @entity15 , stock image pictured , that model provides a 360 - degree view of the concentration camp			1
it can be programmed to show what individual guards would have seen from watchtowers			1
this could be used to prove they were aware of deaths in the camp , for example officers from @entity40 are using a handheld 3d scanner to perfectly record computer models of indoor and outdoor scenes of crime			1
called @entity46 , because of the way it moves like its namesake in the @entity46 , the scanner has previously been used to produce models of famous landmarks and shipwrecks , yet this is the first time the technology has been used to fight crime			0
using @entity46 , also known as @entity56 , police can now easily access these hard to reach places and map confined spaces where it may be difficult to set up bulky camera equipment and tripods			0
it also means less disturbance of the crime scene and scans can be uploaded in almost real - time			0
the surge in cases follows a landmark ruling in 2011 that set a precedent for guards to be tried for murders that happened during their watch , even if they were n’t individually involved in the deaths			1
@entity77 , a former guard at the @entity79 camp in @entity16 , was convicted for being an accessory to the murder of 28,060 people who died during 1943			0
up until then , cases required evidence linking suspects explicitly to specific killings			1
many guards have previously claimed the camps were so large they could n’t possibly have known what was going on in individual rooms and sections			0
while building a case into suspect @entity94 , now 94 , @entity92 prosecutor @entity91 , used @entity96 software to reconstruct @entity15 and its outbuildings			2
the digital model can be used with online tours , pictured , of the the camp , as well as other information , including the years guards served , and any changes that were made to the layout of the camps his model provides a 360 - degree view of the camp and it can be set to show what was visible from individual watchtowers			1
@entity94 was a cook at @entity15 and the model also reveals what was visible from the kitchen			2
‘ many former guards say that they did n’t know anything because they could n’t see from where they were serving , ’ @entity91 told @entity113 at the @entity114			0
‘ this allows us to go in and look at whether that is true			0
what could one see from a watchtower ? could you see the chimneys of the crematoria ? could you see smoke ? ’ the model can also be used with online virtual tours of the the camp , as well as other information , including the years guards served , and any changes that were made to the layout of the camps			1
in february , the case was dismissed due to the age of the defendant but @entity91 claims its model could be used in future cases .			0

a @entity24 prosecutor built a 3d virtual model of @entity15 - @entity15
his model provides a 360 *°* view of the concentration camp
it can be set to show what guards would have seen from watchtowers
this could be used to prove they knew about camp deaths , for example
cases have recently been opened into @entity161 officers after a 2011 ruling meant prosecutors did *n't* need evidence linking guards to individual deaths
