by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 05:06 est , 10 march 2014 a council has been slapped down by health and safety chiefs after it refused to clear up dog mess in a playground because of the risk it posed to workers			1
officials at @entity11 , @entity12 , had said that telling groundsmen to clear faeces from the play area in @entity16 , a well - to - do suburb , could expose them to disease			0
parents who asked the council to take action over the mess were told : ' unfortunately , the @entity23 's grounds maintenance team are not allowed to tackle dog fouling by hand ( including spades ) for health and safety reasons			2
' risk : officials at @entity11 , @entity12 , had said that telling groundsmen to clear faeces from a play area like this one in @entity16 , a well - to - do suburb , could expose them to disease			0
( @entity36 image ) @entity39 at the refusal , the parents complained to the @entity41 's @entity40 , which ruled that @entity11 had used an ' unjustified health and safety reason for not clearing up the dog fouling			1
' @entity41 chairman @entity44 , who heads the @entity40 , said that it was ' right and proper ' that council workers should clean up the playground to protect children from the potentially hazardous waste			1
' there are no rules which prevent this and the precautions needed to protect workers are simple and straightforward , ' she told @entity55 ' refusing to clean up is just unhelpful			1
' @entity56 , a father who was among the parents who brought the complaint against @entity11 , said that council officials had agreed to build a wall around the playground to stop dogs coming in and using it as a toilet			0
he said he was satisfied with the decision and would not take the complaint any further			0
' just unhelpful ' : the decision by @entity11 , whose hq is pictured , was reversed after a complaint rebuke : @entity41 chairman @entity44 , left , and welfare minister @entity71 , right , have both been in touch with the council to tell it that its workers are responsible for clearing up mess the @entity41 's @entity40 challenges the incorrect use of health and safety rules			1
it said in its decision : ' in this case those most at risk from the behaviour of irresponsible dog owners are children			0
' @entity23 is right to encourage owners to clean up after their dogs â€“ and the steps they are taking to keep dogs out of the play area are sensible			0
' however , saying that their staff can not clear up the mess for health and safety reasons is incorrect			2
any risks to adults from clearing up after dogs can be easily managed by simple precautions and good hygiene			0
' @entity71 , the welfare minister , who is also in charge of health and safety , said he had personally written to @entity11 to correct them on their misuse of the rules			2
he said there were no rules to stop council staff clearing up dog mess , adding : ' in fact , the risks to children of leaving dog mess , including spreading disease and causing blindness , far outweigh the costs of cleaning it up			1

@entity11 said health and safety rules *banned* workers from clearing dog mess
but its decision was overturned after an appeal to health and safety chiefs
' refusing to clean up is just unhelpful , ' says @entity41 chairman @entity44
