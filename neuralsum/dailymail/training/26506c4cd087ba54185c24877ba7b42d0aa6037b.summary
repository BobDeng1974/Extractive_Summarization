president @entity0 has said he wo n't engage in any ' wheeling , dealing and trading ' to get @entity3 leaker @entity2 extradited from @entity4 to the @entity5			1
' i 'm not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29 - year - old hacker , ' the president said of the whistleblower during his trip to @entity12 , @entity13 on thursday			0
@entity2 , who is actually 30 , fled to @entity14 last month ahead of leaking details about an @entity3 surveillance program			1
he is now in the transit area of @entity18 in @entity19			1
despite the @entity5 urging @entity4 to extradite him immediately , president @entity20 refused , saying there is no extradition treaty with the @entity5 , and @entity2 has not committed any crimes in his country			1
he previously booked a flight for @entity37 , @entity38 , yet failed to take it and the @entity40 reported he did not board the last flight there today			0
the next possible flight to @entity38 is saturday			0
until he leaves the airport , he must remain in the transit area			1
for such a long stay , he must have secured a transit visa from a consulate operating in the zone			0
speaking dismissively of the situation , @entity0 said that he has not personally called @entity20 or @entity52 president @entity51 to request they extradite @entity2 , adding : ' i should n't have to			1
' he said that the documents leaked by @entity2 have had their effect but that the government has responded that the surveillance programs are conducted legally and with proper oversight			2
he added that @entity2 's story has the makings of a big - screen spy film or a ' made - for - tv movie '			2
on the run : @entity2 is currently believed to be in a transit terminal of a @entity4 airport as he waits for asylum papers from @entity68 the comments come after it emerged that the @entity5 embarrassingly failed to extradite @entity2 from @entity14 after using the wrong middle name on papers			1
@entity74 arrest warrant documents listed his middle name as @entity76 , whereas it is @entity77			0
in other papers , he was just called @entity2 , @entity14 's secretary of justice @entity78 said			2
when @entity14 asked the @entity5 for clarification last friday , they failed to respond in time for officials to stop @entity2 's flight to @entity4 on sunday			1
' until the minute of @entity2 's departure , the @entity5 government had n't yet replied to our requests for clarification , ' @entity78 told the @entity89			2
' @entity14 's government had no legal basis to block his departure			2
' it is believed he hopes to seek asylum in @entity68 , a process which could take months			0
hideout : he is in the transit area of @entity101 airport in @entity19 after flying from @entity14 on sunday no sign of @entity2 : passengers wait in the transit area of the airport where @entity2 has been for days hordes of journalists have camped in and around the airport , looking for @entity2 or anyone who may have seen			1
but after talking to passengers , airport personnel , waiters and shop clerks , the press corps has discovered no trace of the elusive leaker , @entity110 reported			2
@entity4 news agencies , citing unidentified sources , reported that @entity2 was staying at a hotel in the transit terminal , but he was nowhere to be seen at the zone 's only hotel , called ' @entity124 '			1
the area where @entity2 is purportedly staying serves both connecting passengers traveling via @entity19 to onward destinations and passengers departing from @entity19 who have passed border and security checks			1
the departure and transit area has dozens of small rooms , some labeled ' authorized personnel only , ' where one could potentially seek refuge with support from airport staff or security personnel			1
there are also a few vip lounge areas , accessible to business - class passengers or people willing to pay some $ 20 per hour			0
@entity2 was not seen in those areas			2
exiting the area would either require boarding a plane or passing through border control			0
both require a valid passport or other identification ; the @entity5 has revoked @entity2 's passport			2
@entity68 foreign minister @entity151 compared @entity2 's case to that of @entity154 , the founder of @entity155 , who has been given asylum in the @entity157 in @entity158			0
' it took us two months to make a decision in the case of @entity154 , so do not expect us to make a decision sooner this time , ' @entity151 told reporters			0
@entity2 , who is charged with violating @entity5 espionage laws , fled @entity14 on sunday and flew to @entity4			1
@entity4 only acknowledged his arrival only on tuesday , when president @entity20 said @entity2 was still in the transit zone of @entity19 's @entity18			1
foreign minister @entity168 confirmed that he remained there on wednesday			0
@entity2 had also booked a seat on a @entity37 - bound flight on monday en route to @entity173 and then possible asylum in @entity68 , but he failed to board the plane			0
despite @entity5 officials called for @entity2 to be extradited immediately , but @entity4 said it would not as they have no extradition treaty with the country and @entity2 has not committed a crime in @entity4			1
' he has n't violated any of our laws , he has n't crossed our border , he is in the transit zone of the airport and has the right to fly in any direction he wants , ' @entity168 said			0
asked if @entity68 would provide protection to @entity2 while considering his request for asylum , @entity151 said through a translator that if @entity2 ' goes to the embassy , then we will make a decision			0
' @entity151 refused to say what criteria his government would use , but added that it would ' consider all these risks ' , including whether it could hurt trade with the @entity5 and damage @entity68 's economy			2
hurdles : @entity68 's foreign minister @entity151 said it could take months to secure asylum for @entity2 @entity155 gave a terse update on @entity2 's condition earlier on wednesday , saying in a statement posted to @entity206 that @entity2 was ' well '			0
@entity155 says that one of its staffers , @entity207 , was traveling with @entity2 , but the statement gave no indication if the update came from her , from @entity2 , or from some other source			0
in a conference with reporters on monday , @entity154 said that he was limited in what he could say about @entity2 due to security concerns			0
