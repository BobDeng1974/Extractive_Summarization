by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 16 august 2013 targets : @entity2 are aiming to reduce their proportion of students from private schools by 10 per cent in the next four years universities are unfairly favouring applicants from state schools , according to a private school leader			1
@entity10 , chairman of the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , claimed it was ‘ so wrong ’ that institutions are asked to set targets on the numbers of state school and poorer youngsters they recruit			1
many university modern language departments would ‘ be forced to close ’ if it were not for private school students , he insisted			1
a number of medicine , engineering , maths , classics and music departments also depend on these pupils			2
mr @entity10 said that many universities have ‘ been persuaded ’ by the @entity30 to ‘ target a reduction in the proportion of students coming from private schools ’			2
@entity2 , for example , is aiming to decrease the proportion of students from private schools ( currently 35 per cent ) by ten per cent by 2017 , he added			1
writing in the @entity37 , he said : ‘ one reason this is so wrong is that private schools now educate large numbers of bright students from lower - income backgrounds			2
‘ more than a third of our students are on reduced fees and many receive means - tested bursaries aimed at children from the lowest income homes			0
‘ when i started teaching 40 years ago , bursaries were unheard of and most scholarships went to children from wealthy homes			0
today , much of that money has been diverted to means - tested bursaries			0
’ he added : ‘ another reason why the emphasis on independent / state school targets is so wrong is that it permits universities to claim they are doing their bit for social mobility when in fact they are simply taking more students from selective grammar schools and middle - class comprehensives			0
‘ the measure fails to identify the most disadvantaged children , in the most deprived areas , which is where the battle for improved social mobility really needs to be fought			0
’ ' unfair ' : chairman of @entity11 @entity10 said university departments depend on private school students to keep running the national a-level results for @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , published on thursday , showed that the proportion of a-level grades scoring an @entity84 had fallen for the second year running as rising numbers of students opted for traditional subjects like science and maths			1
in total , 26.3 per cent of entries scored an @entity84 , down from 26.6 per cent last year .			0
