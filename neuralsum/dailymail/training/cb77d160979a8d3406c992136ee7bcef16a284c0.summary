engineers have revealed that the size of pterosaurs such as the pterodactyl was limited by their ability to get airborne think of a pterodactyl and you may imagine a fierce flying predator soaring over volcanoes and prehistoric palms			1
but the reality for some larger creatures may have been less successful			1
engineers have revealed that the size of pterosaurs was limited by their ability to get airborne , because if they grew too large and heavy , they would not have had the strength to take off and would likely have been eaten by other predators			1
the discovery of large numbers of fossil species indicates that pterosaurs were initially highly successful , but creatures with a wingspan of over 39 ft ( 12 metres ) may have had trouble taking off , according to researchers			1
the flying reptiles lived from the @entity25 to the early @entity27 period between 228 million and 66 million years ago			1
with wingspans of around 32ft ( 10 metres ) the largest species may have weighed as much as a quarter of a ton			1
they were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight			1
a transatlantic team of experts used 3d imaging of fossils to create a computer model of a pterosaur with a 19 ft ( 6 metre ) wingspan			1
this model was then scaled up to create enlarged models with 29 ft ( 9 metre ) and 39 ft ( 12 metre ) wingspans			1
they were used to estimate the wing strength , flexibility , flying speed and power required for flight in massive pterosaurs to see if textbook images of enormous beasts soaring through the skies were scientifically possible			2
the results showed that even the largest pterosaur would have been able to sustain flight by using air currents to glide			2
it would also have been able to slow down sufficiently to make a safe landing because its wings were formed from a flexible membrane			0

this illustration shows how large the animals were , compared to a giraffe and human pterodactyls used both their arms and legs to push themselves off the ground during take - off , in a manoeuvre known as the ' quadrupedal launch '			0
they were almost as tall as a giraffe with wing spans of around 32ft ( 10 metres )			2
using a computer model , engineers worked out that creatures with a wing span of 39 ft ( 12 metres or above ) would not be able to take off			1
they showed that even the largest pterosaur would have been able to sustain flight by using air currents to glide			2
it would also have been able to slow down sufficiently to make a safe landing because its wings were formed from a flexible membrane			0
but taking off was all but impossible because large reptiles weighing almost half a tonne would not have had the push - off force required to get the model off the ground			1
take - off , on the other hand , proved an entirely greater challenge in the computer experiments			2
unlike modern birds , pterosaur anatomy suggests that they used both their arms and legs to push themselves off the ground during take - off , in a manoeuvre known as the ' quadrupedal launch '			0
however , the results suggest that larger - than - usual specimens , weighing towards half a ton , would have struggled to get off the ground			1
once wingspans approached 39ft ( 12 metres ) , the push - off force required to get the model off the ground was too great			1
@entity117 mechanical engineer @entity116 said : ‘ getting into the air ultimately limited pterosaur size			1
‘ even with their unique four legged launch technique , the iron laws of physics eventually caught up with these all time giants of the cretaceous skies			0
’ the team will present their results at the upcoming @entity128 meeting in @entity129			0
mr @entity116 , who has worked on sailing boats and windmills , said : ‘ it has been fascinating to apply an engineering approach to understanding biological systems			0
’ @entity136 condors ( pictured ) can become too heavy to take off from the ground and have to find a ledge vultures have weak legs and feet along with bulky bodies			0
while this is no disadvantage in the air , it makes it difficult for the birds to get airborne from the ground			2
to overcome this problem , the heavy birds run downhill to pick up speed in order to launch , or jump off cliffs and high ledges to take off			0
once they are airborne , their large wings enable them to glide and soar to spot prey			1
vultures soar slowly and stably			2
they average 30 mph in flight and can get up to 40mph			0
they take about 16 seconds to complete a circle in soaring flight			0
when they spot a carcass , the large birds sometimes eat too much , which increases their weight further , meaning they ca n't take off			0
the @entity136 condor , for example , can survive up to two weeks without a meal			0
so when it feasts , it eats until it 's full , storing up to three lbs of meat in a part of its oesophagus , not to mention its stomach			0
if it overdoes it , the bird makes itself sick to lighten the load and get airborne again			0
the flying reptiles lived from the @entity25 to the early @entity27 period between 228 million and 66 million years ago			0
pictured is a fossil of one of the best preserved and most complete pterodactyls discovered			0

engineers at @entity117 and the @entity189 , @entity190 , made a computer model of a pterodactyl to *analyse* its flight
they found that their size was limited by their ability to get airborne
reptiles with wingspans of 40 ft ( 12 metres ) would have struggled to get airborne , but would have been able to soar and to land safely
such creatures may have weighed almost half a tonne ( 400kg )
