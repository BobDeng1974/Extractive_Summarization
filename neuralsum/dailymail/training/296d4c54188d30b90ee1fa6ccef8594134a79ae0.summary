the players on the tee this morning will be a bag of nerves			0
after playing nine holes on thursday as part of the @entity7 , i can totally sympathise ! it might sound stupid , but teeing off on the first was as nerve - racking as when i made my @entity10 debut			2
the adrenaline was incredible but i struggled to get the ball on the tee			0
@entity14 says teeing off on the first at @entity16 was more nerve - wracking than his @entity10 debut @entity14 's opponent and hero @entity18 warns the gallery as he readies to hit his driver @entity14 hits out of the bunker on thursday in the @entity23 's @entity7 it was a privilege to be there and to play with @entity26 against @entity27 and @entity18 - one of my heroes and the man who signed me as a 17 - year - old			1
the course was in fantastic condition but , speaking from experience , the players will want to stay on the fairways - that rough is juicy ! it ’s beautifully set up for the players but it is a fair course , so good shots will be rewarded			1
the @entity41 hospitality was fantastic and there was plenty of banter but in the end they were too strong - home advantage paid off for @entity18 ! what a weekend we now have in store			2
great golfing drama sprinkled with some @entity52 derby action			0
it does n’t get any better			0
@entity18 ( right ) and @entity14 high five as the senior @entity56 legend gets the better of the younger @entity14 says the roughs at @entity16 are juicy , but he still managed to hit the greens over nine holes			1

@entity14 *joined* @entity26 to face @entity27 and @entity18 in the @entity23 's @entity7 at @entity16
@entity18 signed @entity14 to @entity56 when he was 17 - years - old
speaking from experience , @entity14 says the roughs are juicy
@entity18 and @entity27 *defeated* @entity14 and @entity26
