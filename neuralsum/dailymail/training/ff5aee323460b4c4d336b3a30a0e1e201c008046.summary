but daily suffering is still a fact of life for tens of thousands of wounded men and women in @entity9 , struck down by the countless land mines which lay dormant under its soil			1
these images , taken this week in a rehabilitation centre in @entity15 , one of the largest cities in the country , show some of the nation 's 25,000 amputees being helped through their injuries			1
injury : a woman poses with her prosthetic leg at a rehabilitation centre in @entity15 , @entity9 rehabilitation : thanks to prosthetics and treatment , victims of land mines at the centre can work their way towards recovery crafting : a @entity36 worker helps to build a prosthetic limb at the rehabilitation centre exercise : a staff member supervises a training session in which these amputees can learn to move confidently using their prosthetics staff at the centre , run by @entity36 , help provide the injured with the right prosthetic limbs , and teach them to move again after life - changing injuries caused by decades - old explosives			1
in stirring scenes the severely - injured patients are shown learning to walk again using their new prosthetic limbs , which are crafted for them on - site by members of staff			0
estimates vary as to exactly how many mines devices pepper the landscape of the @entity60 nation , first laid in serious numbers when the country was gripped by civil war in the late 1960s and early 1970s			1
hundreds of thousands more were set in later years as @entity65 forces occupied the country in the 1980s , then by the country 's own army as the communist government fell in the 1990s			0
in 2010 it was estimated that as many as 6million mines are still unexploded in the @entity9 soil , covering 276 square miles of land			1
in a country with a population of around 15million , it means there is more than one mine for every three people			0
dressing : a patient 's limb is covered with plaster to make a mould for a prosthetic limb getting started : a female patient is helped in to her replacement leg by a staff member support : patients are helped to leave wheelchairs and take their own steps at the centre since 1979 a total of 64,308 land mine casualties have been recorded by the official government monitoring body			1
almost a third of the victims , some 20,000 , were killed by the explosions , while 8,918 of those affected required amputations			0
according to some estimates , @entity9 has the most amputees per capita in the world			1
overwhelmingly it is men who are struck down by the mines - accounting for more than 80 per cent of incidents			2
some 6,000 boys were wounded or killed , along with 4,750 women , 1,367 girls - and 63 were ravaged so badly by the explosion that it was impossible to tell			2
finishing off : a craftsman is shown partway through building a prosthetic leg weigh in : a patient takes to the scales in his recovery from a life - changing injury meeting : a member of staff assesses a new patients			2
hundreds a year are still wounded by explosives although casualties have no dropped to fewer than 200 a year , experts still expect it to take a decade or more before the country is made safe			2

their work also targets attitudes towards the disabled			0
physical rehabilitation services and produce and fit prosthetic limbs and orthoses			0
our projects also focus on tackling barriers to inclusion and activities to prevent the development of disabling impairments			0
at the @entity144 , a fifth of all patients are recovering from land mine - related injuries , while unsafe roads also contribute to a large amount of disabilities .			0

countless mines were laid in @entity9 *successive* conflicts since 1970s
