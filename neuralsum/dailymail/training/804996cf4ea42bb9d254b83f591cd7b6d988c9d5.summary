' you watch and just wonder if he was born to play football , ' declared @entity4 boss @entity3 after his star midfielder @entity5 graced the @entity7 turf for the first time this season following a speedy recovery from the knee ligament injury he suffered in august			1
to the surprise of most @entity4 fans , @entity5 was hurled into @entity3 's starting line - up as he drove his side to a 3 - 0 victory against @entity16 on saturday , picking up an assist and a standing ovation along the way			1
now , with @entity21 looming , @entity5 will get the chance to make his @entity24 bow as @entity4 prepare for their @entity26 clash against the 2011 @entity28 champions on thursday			2

@entity4 's stuttering start to the @entity64 campaign was handed a timely boost as @entity5 returned last weekend and although his absence was n't the sole reason for the @entity4 ' tough time , his 66 minutes against @entity16 showed exactly what @entity3 had been missing and it 's no coincidence that @entity5 played a part in arguably his side 's most impressive win of the season			1
@entity5 plays with a maturity beyond his years , but that does n't detract from his almost schoolboy desire to attack and run directly at defenders with a confidence and directness that lifts the @entity4 faithful from their seats			0
last season , @entity5 completed 80 take - ons , the fourth highest in the @entity64 , and although he attempted just one on saturday , his close control and threat on the ball meant the youngster was occupying two or three @entity16 players at once , which created pockets of space for his team - mates			0

believes @entity5 was born to play football kick - off : thursday , october 23 , 6pm tv : @entity98 from 5.30pm @entity33 will be the biggest beneficiary from @entity5 's return and the £ 28million @entity100 looked a much better player with the @entity103 international tucked into the no 10 role in support			2
for all his self - confidence and obvious potential , @entity33 has been a source of frustration for @entity4 fans so far this season , often looking leggy and showing a poor first touch around the opposition 's box			0
but with @entity5 playing behind him , @entity33 actually looks worthy of his hefty price tag and will be grateful to his team - mate for the pass which led to the @entity100 's third @entity64 goal of the season			0
and with 13 of his 16 goals last season coming while @entity5 was on the pitch , it 's no wonder @entity33 is so happy that his ' friend and brother ' is back in a blue shirt			0
@entity103 midfielder @entity5 plays a lofted pass against @entity129 's side as @entity33 looks on @entity33 , who has described @entity5 as a ' friend and brother ' , thinks the midfielder is the best player at @entity4 the former @entity134 striker told @entity4 's official website : ' he is like a friend and brother to me off the pitch			2
' i am very happy that he is back on it because he brings something that the whole team needs			0
' in @entity143 on thursday , @entity5 looks set to make his @entity24 debut and with the @entity26 being the gateway to the @entity146 for the first time , he could soon find himself playing on @entity45 's elite stage should @entity3 's side go all the way on their road to @entity53			1
@entity5 helps to knit @entity3 's free - flowing football together , making space for @entity33 while bringing in @entity4 's marauding full backs @entity155 and @entity156 , which will be key to @entity4 's game plan on thursday night as they look to exploit a @entity21 side that have won just two of their last eight games in all competitions			1
@entity3 ( left ) watches his players prepare for their @entity26 clash with @entity21 on thursday night @entity4 duo @entity165 ( second from right ) and @entity155 ( right ) get put through their paces @entity21 may not have had the brightest start to their domestic campaign - 15 points from 10 matches - but they have more than enough to test @entity3 's side			1
@entity173 loanee @entity172 will be looking to endear himself to @entity175 fans as the @entity100 striker aims to add to his tally of five goals in all competitions for the @entity143 club against his @entity182 rivals to be			0
@entity172 , who agreed a £ 10milllion move to @entity173 last summer on the back of an impressive @entity185 , has been hailed as a ' monster ' by compatriot and @entity189 captain @entity188 and will provide a stern test for @entity4 's backline , whether he plays from the left or the centre of @entity21 's front three			0
@entity172 , pictured celebrating against @entity195 , is on loan at @entity21 from @entity4 's rivals @entity173 @entity21 's players train at their home stadium as they prepare to welcome their @entity201 opponents to @entity143 without @entity5 , the @entity4 have recorded two impressive results in @entity45 so far , a resounding 4 - 1 win against @entity195 and a hard - fought 1 - 1 draw with @entity205 in @entity206 , while @entity21 remain unbeaten but are yet to collect a win after two draws from their opening two games			1
@entity4 fans tuning into @entity98 from 5.30pm on thursday night will hope another fearless @entity5 performance will inspire them to three points , while showing the rest of @entity45 why he was born to play football .			0
