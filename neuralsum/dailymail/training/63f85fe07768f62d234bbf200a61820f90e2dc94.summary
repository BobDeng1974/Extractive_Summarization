when @entity0 discovered his wife of four years was leaving him after a whirlwind holiday romance with an @entity4 gardener he was , quite naturally , devastated			1
but his heartbreak turned to anger when he was told that 35 - year - old @entity7 had tied the knot in secret in @entity10			1
@entity0 , 44 , gathered up his wife ’s collection of designer clothes and shoes , dumped them on the patio of their £ 200,000 detached home , and started a bonfire			1
happier times : @entity0 and @entity21 on their wedding day , but @entity7 later left her husband and married a man she met in @entity10 while on holiday , sending him into a furious rage fifty handbags and more than 100 pairs of shoes – from the likes of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 – went on the blazing pile			1
for six hours the company director fed item after item into the flames in the back garden and watched as they went up in smoke			2
his revenge earned him a 12 - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , and a £ 5,000 bill to cover the damage to his ex-wife ’s possessions			1
but despite the threat of jail , the father - of - two remained unrepentant yesterday			2
he said he had no idea his wife and 25 - year - old gardener @entity55 had fallen in love during a family holiday to @entity4 in december			1
the couple , who married in 2008 , and their two children had travelled to @entity10 on @entity61 last year			1
while staying in @entity63 they met £ 20 - a - week gardener mr @entity55			2
victim : @entity21 , pictured , will receive £ 5,000 in compensation from her ex-husband for the property she lost in the patio blaze ‘ i never even expected anything was going on between them , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t really know when it started to be honest			2
‘ we got back on january 7 and about two weeks later i suggested she went back for another holiday , so she took our kids			0
when she came back , something was n’t right			0
‘ i tried to confront her about it but we ended up having a huge row and i left			0
’ weeks later , in march , @entity0 discovered his wife had returned to @entity10 once more , so he drove round to the family ’s £ 200,000 detached home in @entity84 , @entity85			1
while he was there his wife ’s mother arrived			0
he claims she showed him the photographs and said they were of the wedding day			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ she told me that @entity7 had married this guy out there in january			1
i was absolutely shell - shocked			0
i could n’t believe it at first but then her mum gave me the wedding photos , showing @entity7 in her wedding dress and with all of his family			1
i could n’t believe she had actually married this guy			2
they ’d known each other about a week			0
what could they possibly have in common ? ’ mr @entity0 was so angry he found the wedding dress she had worn to marry mr @entity55 and , along with all of her designer shoes , handbags and clothes , set fire to them			1
‘ she loved her designer gear , so i knew it would annoy her			0
i bought most of the stuff anyway so i thought , right , i paid for this , i ’m going to burn it , ’ he added			0
‘ there was stuff by @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , about 50 handbags , 100 pairs of shoes – anything i could get my hands on			0
‘ i made a pile of them on the flagstones in the back of the garden , poured petrol all over it and burnt the lot			0
@entity133 : once @entity0 heard his wife had married another man he stormed to their marital home in @entity84 , pictured , and torched designer clothes , shoes and handbags ‘ one of the neighbours sent her an email in @entity10 to tell her what was happening so the next thing i knew , the police were knocking on the door			1
‘ i told them i was just burning some of my old clothes			1
’ @entity0 , who ran a store fitting company with his wife until they split up , was later charged with arson and theft and admitted the offences at @entity154			1
@entity155 , mitigating , said : ‘ mr @entity0 kept his wife , he thought , very happy over the years			2
it ’s difficult for him not to see himself as the victim in this case			0
he has lost his wife , his house and his children			0
’ @entity0 , who has previous convictions for offences including grievous bodily harm , theft and burglary , must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work			2
he said he divorced two weeks ago			0
since then , his ex-wife has returned to @entity10 to officially register her marriage and plans to bring her new husband back to the @entity171			1
mrs @entity21 said yesterday : ‘ how am i meant to get married in one country when i ’m already married in another ? that ’s bigamy			2
you tell me how that ’s possible			0
