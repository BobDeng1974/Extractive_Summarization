his admission amounts to a second climbdown since he promised to ‘ compete @entity3 out of existence ’			1
his criticism of the company last month was rapidly followed by the disclosure that the @entity9 ’s pension fund had invested money in one of @entity3 ’s financial backers			1
the archbishop said the responses to @entity28 following his remarks on payday lenders had been ‘ overwhelmingly positive ’			0
however , he added : ‘ talk is cheap – and my job involves a lot of it – but the challenge is in delivery			0
' the result of the interest in how the @entity9 plans to support credit unions is that there is now , quite rightly , pressure to deliver			2
and it feels quite scary			0
' putting together the partnerships and logistics to have a good product , piloting it and learning from the results , and then turning it into something effective : this needs major skills and much time – at least a decade , in fact			2
’ the archbishop made the admission in a blog published by @entity28 while he was away on a brief visit to @entity58			0
waging war : archbishop @entity0 opened his attack on @entity3 ( advert pictured ) in an interview in which he said he had told the firm 's chief that the @entity9 would try to ' compete you out of existence ' ‘ i often admire politicians for putting themselves in a place which demands they turn words into reality			1

archbishop @entity0 opened his attack on @entity3 in an interview in which he declared : ‘ i ’ve met the head of @entity3 and we had a good conversation and i said to him bluntly , “ we ’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence , we ’re trying to compete you out of existence ”			2
’ he suggested that 16,000 churches could form the basis of a network of non-profit lending organisations .			0
