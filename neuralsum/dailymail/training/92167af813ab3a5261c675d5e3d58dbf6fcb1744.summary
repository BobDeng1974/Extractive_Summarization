viewers tuning in to enjoy daytime tv today accused @entity3 's @entity2 of ' crossing the line ' , after a live vasectomy was broadcast			1
to mark tomorrow 's @entity7 and to dispel the myths and worries around the procedure , a brave patient was filmed as he went under the knife			1
volunteering for the role , the patient , named only as @entity14 , explained he was already a father of five			1
he told viewers : ' my wife and i have five children and we love them dearly , but we do n't want any more surprises			1
' this morning viewers were shocked to tune in and see a man having a vasectomy live on air presenters @entity25 and @entity27 express their own discomfort at the procedure , as they aimed to dispel the myths and worries surrounding vasectomies ahead of @entity7 tomorrow dr @entity33 , a @entity34 , performed the procedure , while this @entity2 's resident @entity34 dr @entity36 observed			1
in the studio , presenters @entity25 and @entity27 looked visibly uncomfortable at the graphic procedure taking place before their eyes			1
the camera left little to the imagination , zooming right in to the patient 's genitalia and graphically showing them being operated on , as dr @entity33 described the procedure			1
the feature comes after the programme 's resident gp dr @entity36 had a smear test live on air			1
and earlier this year , a couple drank their own urine on the show to try and advocate the health benefits			1
speaking before the procedure , @entity14 , who was given local anaesthetic , added : ' for us this is a fail safe option			2
' we have n't considered any other form of contraception			0
now our family 's complete this is the option for us			0
' i have a bit of anxiety about the procedure but we have got to move forward and so unfortunately i have to go through it			2
' his wife , @entity72 , added : ' we definitely do n't want any more children			0
' i do n't have any nerves about it			0
it is just something he has to have done			0
' but having watched the eye - watering segment , some @entity2 viewers took to @entity83 to express their shock			1
but viewers tuning in expressed their shock , with @ jaschambers1 accusing the show of going too far @ @entity87 accused the show 's images of men 's genitalia of ruining his breakfast another viewer , @ pipbrowyn1 , said the segment on the show had ruined her appetite while @ perla_illy told her followers the live operation had left her feeling sick and @ stuartaelmore tweeted ' a warning would have been nice ' @ jaschambers1 accused the show , which has recently aired a live smear test and a breast examination on air , of going too far			1
she tweeted : ' oh my lord , this morning has crossed the line , no one wants to see a vasectomy live			1
' another viewer @ pipbrowyn wrote : ' um # thismorning cheers for showing a live vasectomy			2
that 's my appetite gone for the next 1,000 years			0
' and @ perla_illy added : ' i ca n't believe i 'm actually watching a live vasectomy on itv this morning ... literally finished my breakfast an about to see it again ( sic )			2
' earlier in the segment , dr @entity36 had explained the ' simple ' procedure is carried out under a local anaesthetic , but warned it is considered irreversible			1
' vasectomy is really just dividing and tying the vas , the tubes where sperm get out from the testicles to the ejaculate , ' she said			1
a vasectomy is a minor operation which is relatively painless and carried under local anaesthetic			0
the tubes that carry sperm from a man 's testicles to the penis are cut , blocked or sealed with heat			1
the procedure can be carried out at your local gp surgery , in hospital as a day patient , at a sexual health clinic or a private clinic			2
there are two types of vasectomy			0
the tradtitional procedure , a conventional vasectomy , involves making two small incisions in the scrotum using a scalpel			2
the 1cm incisions allow the surgeon to access the tubes , known as vas deferens			2
each tube is cut and a small section is removed			0
the ends of the tubes are then closed , either by tying them or sealing them using a high heat			1
the incisions are stitched using dissolvable stitches that disappear within about a week			0
the other type , a no - scapel vasectomy , is a newer technique			2
the doctor will feel for the vas deferens under the skin and hold them in place using a small clamp			0
a special instrument is then used to make a tiny puncture hole in the skin of the scrotum			0
a small pair of forceps is used to open the hole , allowing the surgeon access to the vans deferens without the need to cut the skin using a scalpel			0
the tubes are then closed in the same way as in the conventional method			2
@ probnotbob joked : ' i just watched a live vasectomy on daytime tv and this is why i work ' @ liamhulmes _ joined the viewers shocked at the segment , adding ' i ca n't believe they 're showing a live vasectomy on this morning ' ' the idea is that by cutting and tying it off , sperm ca n't get into the ejaculate			1
' you will still produce ejaculate because sperm is just a tiny part of it			2
' @entity27 raised the question on the minds of most thinking about the technicalities of a vasectomy , asking dr @entity36 ' where the sperm goes '			0
' the sperm ca n't go beyond the tied vas , and so it is reabsorbed by the body , ' dr @entity36 said			0
' it is a natural process , but is something that can cause concern			0
but it does n't cause any problems			0
' she said the procedure has a high success rate , with just one in 2,000 failing			0
' one of the reasons we cut and tie the tubes is to prevent the tubes reattaching , ' she said			1
and she warned the procedure is considered irreversible on the @entity232 , while it is possible in some cases to perform reversals , though they are generally done privately			0
a @entity2 's spokesperson said : ' today 's live vasectomy , on the eve of @entity7 , aimed to dispel myths and fears about this operation			1
' the item also featured expert advice from leading doctors about this procedure and other methods of contraception			0
' warnings were given at the start of the item , and many positive comments were received			0
' a spokesman for the tv watchdog @entity254 said they have received one complaint relating to the live segment earlier today			1
he said : ' we will assess this complaint before deciding whether to investigate			0
' @ allanfoy questioned the decision to air the live op as many will have been tucking into a morning coffee			1

this @entity2 aired the procedure to dispel myths and worries about op
father - of - five opted for procedure to prevent any more little ' surprises '
viewers took to @entity83 airing their shock at the graphic live segment
accused the show of ' crossing the line ' with close - ups of genitals
the simple procedure renders men *infertile* , cutting and tying off the tubes which carry sperm from the testicles to the penis
tv watchdog @entity254 said they have received one complaint
