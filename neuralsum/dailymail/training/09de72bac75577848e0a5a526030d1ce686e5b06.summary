by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , 72 , who died when his organs failed was due to be buried in a metal coffin last thursday a family were left horrified after council officials turned up at their father 's funeral to tell them they could n't bury him in a metal coffin because they are banned			1
@entity12 , 48 , ordered a £ 3,000 , vacuum - sealed , navy blue metal casket with steel handles for her father @entity15 , 72 , but his funeral in @entity17 , @entity11 was halted last thursday			1
she said the service at @entity19 ‘ went beautifully ’ but then the official ‘ ambushed ’ the funeral cortege beside the open grave			1
miss @entity12 , a control room operator , said he told the family that the interment could not go ahead because it breached @entity28 ’s policy barring the use of metal caskets – and that she had two options , either to postpone the burial or to change the casket			1
‘ everybody was in a state of shock , ’ she said			0
’ ' a council official was on the phone in front of the coffin and no one knew what was going on			2
' after about 10 minutes , we were told the council would n't allow us to bury my dad because his casket was metal			1
' we were all in total shock			0
we were given two options , whether to postpone the burial or to swap dad ’s coffin and continue			2
' we chose the latter because all the guests were already there , but we never had a choice in the coffin			2
' after a hurried discussion , the family decided that the hearse should return to the undertaker ’s parlour so that the body could be transferred into a wooden coffin			2
she said her father ’s body was put in a plain , plywood box which was the only one they had in stock			2
' there was then confusion over which way my father was laying and he was spun twice over his own grave , ' she added			2
' before we left the cemetery , the bulldozers were already filling in the earth			0
the navy metal coffin which @entity2 was due to be buried in ( pictured ) was banned by @entity28 mr @entity2 's family members gathered beside the hearse ready to carry his coffin at funeral last thursday ' but because the grave was dug for the original metal casket , which was bigger than the one he ended up in , there were two feet spare all the way round the edge			1
' there mus n’t have been enough soil to properly fill the grave so it had already sunk by the time i visited again on friday			0
' i am devastated and very angry			0
he was just discarded like a piece of rubbish			0
@entity12 , 48 , held the funeral service in @entity19 , in @entity17 , @entity11 ( pictured ) ' the whole ordeal was just absolutely disgusting			1
there was no compassion , respect or dignity			0
i wanted that day to be perfect because it was the last thing i could have doen for my dad			0
' the council ruined that and i can never get that day back			0
our lasting memories of dad are of this , it is heartbreaking and has been haunting me ever since			0
' his family were forced to bury him in a wooden coffin at the last minute after they were told by the council at the funeral they could not use the metal one her brother @entity120 , 38 , said : ' instead of talking about my dad ’s life , people are talking about the utter farce of the funeral			1
' miss @entity12 said the way her father - a former contractor - was treated on the day of the funeral was worse than the day he died			1
' what happened that day , as horrible as it was , could not have been avoided but what happened at his funeral could have , and should have , been avoided			0
' it had gone to far by that point , if they had a problem with the coffin they should have told us before we got to the graveside			2
' their father passed away after a long illness where his organs failed			0
miss @entity12 said she did not blame the undertaker , @entity149 , but added : ‘ it was like @entity28 ambushed my father ’s burial			1
’ miss @entity12 said she is looking at exhuming her father ’s body for reburial in a more suitable coffin			1
she added : ‘ nobody has been talking about what a beautiful service it was			0
it has all been about what happened at the graveside			0
’ @entity28 has since apologised for the incident and said it would make arrangements for mr @entity2 to be reburied in the original metal coffin and would cover the costs			1
@entity168 , the council ’s service director for environmental and street scene , said : ' we would like to apologise to ms @entity12 and her family for the distress out actions caused them during what was already a very difficult time			1
' having looked into the issue we could have acted differently and , on this occasion , carried out the family ’s wished and given them the funeral they originally planned , including the metal casket			1

@entity12 , 48 , ordered navy blue metal coffin to bury her father @entity15 in
but @entity28 has policy against using metallic caskets in funerals
@entity193 stopped service and told family it could not go ahead beside grave
