by @entity0 on the @entity3 series @entity4 , @entity1 claims to be a well - to - do @entity6 girl who just ca n’t stay away from the place she and the rest of the cast consider home - @entity10			1
but in truth @entity12 comes from humble beginnings and her affection for the @entity17 state does n’t seem to run as deep as it appeared on screen			0
not so southern : @entity1 grew up in @entity6 all right , but not exactly in the town she says she came from			1
and she did n't exactly hang around the @entity6 after shooting the reality show home sweet home : she grew up in this double - wide trailer down a dirt road in rural @entity26 , @entity6 house of cards : when @entity12 was asked on the show how she could afford the pricey four - bedroom digs in @entity30 , she answered , ' with my bank account			1
' but the truth is @entity12 never owned or even lived in it			1
while @entity12 gushed in one interview that she did @entity4 because she wanted to spend time with ‘ the two most important things ’ in her life — friends and family — one neighbor who lives just down the dirt road from her mom @entity45 and step - dad @entity36 double - wide trailer throws that sentiment into doubt			1

on the show she made it seem that she had plenty of dough			0
play dough maybe ? ‘ with my bank account , ’ @entity12 snipes			0
the answer to the mystery of how she could afford such lavish living may lie in @entity84 ’s expense account - and what amounted to a pricey hotel for the reality show shoot			1

‘ they used it for some interior and exterior shots and @entity12 had absolutely nothing else to do with the property			2
she never lived there or owned it			0

after she moved out of state , the property was sold for $ 295,000 and re-rented for $ 1900 a month , or less than $ 650 per bedroom			0
these days @entity12 ’s life is almost solely concentrated far away from @entity6 in @entity132 , where she lives the good life			1

but the wealthy real estate mogul lavished her with louboutins and designer togs much of @entity12 's around - the - world escapades were thanks to @entity137 , her 55 - year - old real estate magnate boyfriend at the time she shot show			1

in her @entity3 bio , @entity12 claims she grew up in @entity179 , @entity6 , a small city with a population of 40,000			1
in reality , she hails from @entity26 , a village ten miles away that has just over 3,000 residents			0
and that little white lie does n’t sit right with one local			0
well - heeled : @entity12 flashing a pair of @entity158 stilettos on @entity137 's jet ‘ i told people if i were ever to get famous i would n’t claim @entity179 , i ’d claim @entity26 , ’ local @entity188 , 26 , tells @entity89 of the town that consists of a gas station , post office and two tiny general stores			1

splish splash : @entity12 was all wet when she said she paid for the @entity10 house with her bank account these days @entity12 ’s life is almost solely concentrated far away from @entity6 in @entity132			1
