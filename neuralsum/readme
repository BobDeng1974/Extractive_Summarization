1. Introduction
This dataset contains CNN and Dailymail articles used for training a summarization system. The script used to create the dataset is modified from the release of Hermann et al. 2015.

2. Format:
Each file contains four parts separated by ‘\n\n’. They are
* url of the original article;
* sentences in the article and their labels (for sentence-based extractive summarization);
* extractable highlights (for word extraction-based abstractive summarization);
* named entity mapping.

3. Sentence labels
There are three labels for the sentences: 1, 2 and 0. 
1—-sentence should extracted; 
2--sentence might be extracted; 
0—-sentence shouldn't be extracted.

4. Extractable highlights
The extractable highlights are created by examining if a word (or its morphological transformation) in the highlight appears in the article or a general purpose stop-word list, which together constitute the output space (i.e., the allowed vocabulary during summary generation).
