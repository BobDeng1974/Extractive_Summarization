@entity1 head coach @entity0 has responded to last weekend 's shock defeat by @entity3 by making five changes to his starting xv to face @entity5 at @entity6 on saturday			1
there are two new faces at half - back with @entity10 and @entity11 coming in for @entity12 and @entity13 , while @entity14 replaces @entity15 on the right wing			2
up front , @entity17 starts ahead of @entity19 and experienced flanker @entity20 starts ahead of @entity21			2
' we 've accepted our performance against @entity3 last weekend was not up to scratch and everyone in the touring squad has put up their hands and dug deep this week , ' @entity0 told @entity50			1
' we 've really worked hard at fixing the mistakes we made and the challenge is now to put that into action on saturday			0
' @entity11 started at @entity6 for us two years ago and did very well			1
he 's playing well at the moment and i wanted to give him the opportunity to start			0
@entity11 is tactically very astute and even though he 's still pretty young , he 's got a lot of experience			0
@entity20 ( left ) will also start for @entity0 's side at @entity6 on saturday ' @entity17 , @entity20 and @entity14 have all started a number of @entity62 this year and they will slot in easily â€“ we decided beforehand that we wanted to start all of these players in one of the first two tests on tour			1
' it 's a big occasion for @entity10 but he would not have been here if we did n't believe he could deliver the goods , and he 'll be next to his provincial team - mate in @entity73 ' as usual , we 're also expecting our replacements to raise the intensity when they 're sent on and @entity77 , who had a very good game in @entity80 especially in the set - pieces , @entity82 , @entity12 , @entity83 and @entity13 will provide important cover off the bench			0
