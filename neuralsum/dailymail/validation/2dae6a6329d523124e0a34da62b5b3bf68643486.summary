a @entity1 marketing campaign by @entity2 has backfired after banning the word ' lesbian '			1
the ' say it with @entity2 ' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread , which they could then share with friends on social media			1
but the words ' lesbian ' , ' @entity18 ' and ' orangutan ' are all banned from being emblazoned on the pots , it has been discovered			1
a @entity1 marketing campaign by @entity2 has backfired after banning the word ' lesbian ' ( file picture ) the @entity2 website says : ' here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love			1
' but users realised that there is a long list of words banned , which bizarrely does not allow ' lesbian ' but permits the word ' gay '			2
the word ' @entity37 ' can also be written on the jars , but other religious terms such as ' @entity18 ' and ' muslim ' have been banned by @entity2 , @entity35 reported			1
the ' say it with @entity2 ' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread health - related terms , presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity , have also been banned , including the words ' cancer ' and ' diabetes '			1
the company , owned by @entity57 , has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil , the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans			2
this may explain why ' boycott ' and ' orangutan ' make the long list of banned words			0
@entity57 said in a statement : ' by giving customers the opportunity to personalise their @entity2 jar we want to create a way for them to share enthusiasm for the brand			2
' negative or insulting terms were directly removed from the options field			0
similarly , terms of communities that are often subject to attacks by malicious people were removed from the possibilities			0
' the news comes just a day after it emerged that @entity84 had banned the words ' @entity85 ' and ' @entity87 ' from being allowed on messages sent with bouquets of flowers			0
the policy emerged earlier after a customer was stopped from buying a Â£ 35 bouquet for a funeral because she said in the gift message that it was from a family in ' @entity98 '			0
@entity99 , a former archbishop of @entity100 , said : ' if @entity85 becomes an offensive word in a @entity37 land then all of us should be alarmed			0
