@entity26 stars could go on strike over tax hikes on those earning more than 150,000 euros that would mean towns including @entity32 - a favourite haunt of @entity36 a-listers @entity34 and @entity37 - and the @entity39 town of @entity40 , where @entity41 has a home , would be legally abolished			1
@entity32 has a population of only 479 during the winter as tourists travel elsewhere , while @entity40 has just 957 people living there			1

tourist hotspot : @entity32 , on @entity2 's @entity61 coast , is one of thousands of towns that could virtually disappear under plans to axe bureaucracy lifestyles of the rich and the famous : @entity68 walking with her stylist in @entity32 earlier this week			2
the town is popular with celebrities players have threatened to strike if an agreement is not signed before the start of the season on august 27 , but the @entity76 has estimated the new ' solidarity tax ' would cost teams around 50 million euros each			1
@entity80 vice president , @entity79 , said the players should pay , not the clubs			0
he told the @entity83 : ' those making 90,000 euros will have to pay it , i do n't see why those who make millions should n't do it			1
' otherwise , as far as i 'm concerned the players can go on strike for the rest of their lives			0
' @entity80 is owned by prime minister @entity7 , whose government approved the measures			0
most top players , especially foreign stars , negotiate their net income upon joining a team , and it is then up to the club to handle their fiscal obligations			0
abolished ? @entity102 , on the shores of @entity39 , where @entity100 actor @entity41 owns this home , is another town which could disappear under the municipality merger this was allowed under the old collective agreement , but the new one - which has not yet been signed - leaves it up to players alone to pay their taxes			0
the conflict between the players and the league has been going on since the last collective agreement expired in june last year			1
two strike dates were set during the last season , both of which were avoided with last - minute verbal agreements			0

the @entity145 's largest trade union - has threatened to call a general strike against the austerity measures			0
@entity148 , the union 's general secretary , told the @entity150 : ' once again it 's the weakest who are being hit and those who pay taxes			0

' it comes as global stock markets largely fell as hopes of strong action in the euro zone against the escalating sovereign debt crisis faded			0
the @entity163 closed 5331.60 , down .49 per cent but lost 0.7 per cent by lunch time to 5,319.12 , by which time there had been practically no movement on the @entity167 , which stood at 11,386			2
stocks around the world lost headway after @entity171 announced disappointing growth figures of just 0.1 per cent for the second quarter of this year			2
there was good news in @entity176 , however , after it revealed a 0.7 per cent increase in gdp for the second quarter			1
the country has been run by a caretaker government for the last 15 months , meaning it has been unable to enact austerity measures despite a public debt level of nearly 100 per cent of gdp			2

villages with a population of less than 1,000 could be consolidated to cut costs
but ' *government-less* ' @entity176 bucks the trend with 0.7 **%** increase in gdp
