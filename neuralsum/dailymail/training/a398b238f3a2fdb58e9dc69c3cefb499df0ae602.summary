@entity0 has effectively ruled out selecting @entity1 for this summer ’s @entity2 21 finals			1
@entity5 head coach @entity4 said in november that @entity0 would have priority when picking his squad for the tournament in june , even though the seniors have a friendly against the @entity11 and a @entity13 qualifier in @entity14 that month			1
but @entity0 said : ‘ realistically , @entity1 has become a very important player for the senior team and for @entity17			1
there is a huge demand on him			2
part of my role is looking at the development of individuals and i ’m not convinced another tournament in the summer would be right for him			2
@entity1 wo n't be picked for the @entity25 , says @entity0 @entity1 , pictured in action against @entity14 , is expected to turn out for the senior squad next june instead @entity5 under 21 manager @entity0 says @entity1 does n't need more tournament experience ‘ if he plays another 20 or 30 games before the end of the season , i really ca n’t see him coming			1
@entity32 forbid , if something was to happen and the dynamic changed , in that he needed games , of course you would look at it			0
' but he has been to the @entity38 in @entity39 and a @entity40 last year in @entity41			0
he ’s had tournament experience			1
‘ of course he is a super player and , from a selfish point of view , it would be easy to try and grab all of those			0
but we have to look at the bigger picture			0
’ @entity1 has featured 34 times already for club and country so far this season @entity1 last played for the @entity51 in a 9 - 0 win over @entity53 in november 2013			2
but while @entity0 , who on thursday signed a 12 - month contract extension , is sure about @entity1 , 20 , the picture around @entity56 is less clear			1
the @entity58 midfielder won his sole under 21 cap against @entity61 in august 2013 but he could be involved in @entity62 , particularly if he drops down to the @entity51 for the march friendlies against the @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity58 midfielder @entity56 's @entity5 future remains uncertain @entity0 was at @entity67 last saturday to watch @entity68 and @entity56 in @entity58 ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity70			1
the midfielder ’s form has been indifferent and while there is no disputing his talent , he is not playing well enough to be an @entity5 regular at the highest level			2
‘ @entity56 is interesting as we have n’t had a chance to work with him yet , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he is someone myself and @entity4 will talk about			0
i will also talk to @entity80 , who i get on with very well			0
the boys who have got us to this point are a tight group and i have to think about the dynamic			0
’ alongside @entity5 manager @entity4 ( right ) , @entity0 addresses the media at @entity88 in 2013 the @entity89 have been looking to renew @entity0 ’s terms since @entity5 breezed past @entity91 in the @entity62 play - off last october			1
he had 18 months left on his contract but this deal now runs until after the 2017 tournament as yet , though , there is no indication about whether his influential assistant @entity98 will commit to another qualifying cycle , given his workload with @entity101			2
‘ that would be down to him , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ @entity101 have been really good			0
he has been invaluable to the way we work			0
but it is a massive commitment and he will look at it at the end of this cycle			0
he has been huge for me			0

@entity0 says @entity1 does n't need more tournament experience
@entity17 forward is expected to play for senior squad next june instead
@entity58 midfielder @entity56 's @entity5 future is less certain
