@entity1 boss @entity0 has received public backing from chairman @entity3 despite a run of eight games without a win which has seen the club slip back into relegation trouble			1
@entity3 , writing in the programme for saturday 's game against @entity12 , has made it clear , however , that there were funds made available during the january transfer window which @entity0 chose not to spend			1
the @entity18 tycoon , aware of the disruption caused by instability since he arrived at @entity21 in 2013 , has told his manager he trusts him as the football expert and admires his faith in the current squad			2
@entity0 ' job is safe for now , with @entity3 putting his faith in the manager for footballing matters @entity1 spent big on the likes of @entity31 this summer , but chose not to in january @entity3 said : ' we were certainly mindful of the january transfer window and the opportunities â€“ or temptations - it offers			1
for every successful move in the transfer season there may be half a dozen that fail to produce results , as supporters of @entity1 and likely every club in @entity43 understand all too well			1
' nevertheless , while caution is advised when browsing the transfer market , clubs should be prepared to pounce if the right player is available at the right time			0
' at @entity1 , we were prepared with the appropriate resources and full authority if it made perfect sense			1
manager @entity0 sees our players daily			1
as a top - flight player not that long ago , kit knows and feels the game			2
' he understands and appreciates the @entity1 way			2
and @entity56 knows what we all want , and that 's a side that will make us proud and compete for a return to the @entity60			0
@entity61 of @entity62 takes a shot in a 3 - 0 win , as @entity1 made it eight games without a win @entity3 hopes his players will repay their manager 's faith as the club battles against consecutive relegation ' it 's good to have someone as our manager who wants to achieve success in a proper manner			1
so , i have to applaud kit for his discipline and restraint during this particular january transfer window when the easy and likely popular move would have been to spend for the sake of appearing to be active			2
' the truth is , kit was active			0
kit did n't feel the right options were there			0
as you all know , @entity1 endured some drama over the past 18 months with our managers			1
' @entity0 became @entity3 's fourth manager in little more than a year in control when he replaced @entity94 in september			1
@entity94 came in after @entity95 and @entity96 but was unable to prevent relegation from the @entity60 last year			0
@entity1 improved after a poor start to the season but have not won since the transfer market closed			2
distant play - off hopes have faded , they have slipped back towards the bottom of the @entity103 and face in - form @entity12 next			1
@entity3 added : ' we 've become a more cohesive club , on and off the pitch , since kit was promoted to manager in september			1
there 's a lot of football left this season			0
i 'm confident we 'll finish the season safe , sound and strong			0
@entity3 has had four managers since taking over the club , but is now looking for stability under @entity0 ' but in any event , i pay great respect to @entity108 for having faith in and standing by the players we 've had all season to send us upward			1
what can be better than having a manager who has unconditional faith in you ? ' the hope here is that our squad @entity108 's faith and responds appropriately and immediately with saturday 's encounter against @entity12			0
a positive result against the league leaders in front of the home supporters would do nicely			0
' in the meantime , i want to assure all @entity1 fans that @entity140 will always have my full commitment and attention			2
if kit feels there 's an option to consider during the emergency transfer period , he 'll have my total support to act			0
' there will be no uncertainty or lack of communication , as i speak at great length with @entity108 , @entity154 and @entity155 every monday , at a minimum			0
' they 're all aware of my trust and support in each of them			0
and the same applies for everyone at @entity162 and @entity21			0
we have a great club at @entity1 , and we will fight through this difficult stretch successfully , united as one			2

@entity0 has been @entity1 manager since september
@entity0 started well , but recent form has ended play off hopes
@entity1 boss *refused* to spend money in january to *buy* quick - fix
@entity3 *insists* stability is *key* after four managers in a year
