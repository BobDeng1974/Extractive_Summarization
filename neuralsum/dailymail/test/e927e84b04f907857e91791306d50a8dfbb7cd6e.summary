a fiery stoush has erupted between the chief executive of @entity3 's media empire in @entity4 and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss			2
during a tumultuous day of proceedings at a corporate tax inquiry in @entity13 today , @entity10 ceo @entity9 was peppered with questions from @entity16 senator and party leader @entity17 about why the @entity4 newspaper operates as a business when it is not profitable			1
when mr @entity9 defended the newspaper as the ' finest national newspaper operating in @entity4 ' , ms @entity17 flatly told the inquiry , ' you and i wo n't agree on that '			1
' you 're a minority , ' mr @entity9 fired back			1
' not from the number of people who buy your newspaper , ' ms @entity17 responded			1
' how many do we sell a day ? ' you sell a very small number , ' ms @entity17 responded			1
mr @entity9 also rejected allegations recently published by @entity47 alleging $ 4.5 billion had been siphoned from mr @entity3 's @entity4 operations to the @entity49 virtually tax free			1
he told the hearing the report was ' hopelessly wrong ' , arguing the stories were ' either deliberately misleading or no idea ; looking at the author ( business correspondent @entity54 ) , i would say both '			0
in her questioning , ms @entity17 also alleged the @entity4 was run for ideological purposes			2
mr @entity9 , who argued the paper examined policy , accepted her contention			2
it has been previously reported that the national broadsheet lost $ 30 million in the 2012/13 financial year			0
the paper was reportedly hoping to half that loss in the 2013/14 financial year			0

@entity77 managing director @entity91 said the company made $ 58 million in revenue in 2013 , and profits of just more than $ 46 million , but paid $ 7.1 million in tax			0
earlier , tax commissioner @entity96 continued to refuse to reveal the identities of a number of companies suspected of avoiding tax by shifting billions of dollars offshore			0
@entity86 chairman @entity85 had written to mr @entity96 on tuesday requesting he reveal the names			0
but mr @entity96 refused , and in a response sent to @entity103 and tabled at the hearing on wednesday , defended the decision on the grounds that naming the companies would undermine public confidence in the tax system			2
' the treasurer has been consulted about making these @entity111 ( public interest immunity ) claims , and has endorsed them being made by me as an independent statutory office holder			0
the grounds of the @entity111 claim are as follows , ' the letter said			0
' disclosure of the information will have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient operations of the @entity74 , contrary to the public interest			0
