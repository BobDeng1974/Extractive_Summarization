by @entity0 greetings from @entity2 ! i 'm based in the @entity4 for the next few weeks as we film @entity6 in @entity7			1
i 'm having the best time - loving the shopping and socialising			2
and hard at work , of course ! being over here has given me the opportunity to check out @entity7 make - up habits , and i have to tell you , these @entity7 girls really know their grooming			1
while we @entity20 favour a slightly slap - dash approach to beauty , our @entity7 sisters look sleek and glossy every single day			1
no more sleeping in my make - up , no more spilled powder or lipgloss leaking at the bottom of my handbag			1
it 's time for a new , efficient regime , starting with my make - up tools			1
it 's crazy that , while i 'll often spend big on fabulous cosmetics , i 've been using the same moth - eaten make - up brushes for years			1
well , not any more			0
investing in good quality applicators will make a world of difference to your make - up - allowing you to achieve a more professional - looking ( and beautiful ) finish			1
it 's a no - brainer , really			2
after all , an artist would n't paint a masterpiece with his fingers - so why paint your face with anything but the finest tools ? @entity0 's @entity54 real techniques core collection this handy kit contains a pointed foundation brush , tiny precision brush for eyes and lips , contouring brush and fluffy buffing brush , encased in a handy portable case			1
the quality of these brushes are incredible for the price - my favourite has to be the buffing brush , which i use to apply liquid foundation when i 'm looking for a medium - to - full coverage finish			1
it blends product out seamlessly for a flawless , hd - perfect base			2
@entity77 this is my new must - have , as it allows for the expert application of my fave product - bronzer ( as well as regular face powder )			2
it has a soft , wide head , perfect for buffing and blending powder make - up			1
it 's also soft enough to use anywhere on your body , which means you can use it to contour make - up on the delicate skin of your d√©colletage and neck			1
@entity95 this is a fabulous all - in - one tool for eyes			2
use the ultra-soft contour brush to sweep and blend eyeshadow across your lids without tugging at the delicate skin around your eyes			0
then flip it over and , with the stiffer , pointed liner brush ( used either wet or dry ) , create the perfect precision eyeliner flick			0
@entity107 regular readers will know i 'm a big fan of strong brows and smoky eyes , which means a brush like this one absolutely essential			0
the soft , angled head allows for precision application of eyeshadow and brow make - up , allowing you to place colour exactly where you want it			1
the result ? perfectly defined eyes			0
@entity0 is loving @entity124 's matifying fluid - she says it works well as a sun protector and primer @entity129 this is a clever little brush and the secret is its angled edge			1
the shape allows you to get make - up right into hard - to - manage areas , such as the corners of your nose and eyes			1
not only that , but the cut of this brush is specially designed for use with @entity144 and @entity145 creams , allowing for a super-smooth application and , since you 're not using your fingers , ensuring less oil is transferred from your hands to your face			0
clever ! @entity153 this full , firm foundation brush has bristles made from @entity156 - a clever substance which picks up and dispenses more product than a regular hair brush			2
use it to apply a really professional - looking base - you 'll be so amazed at how flawless your skin looks , you 'll never go back to finger painting ! @entity165 a great all - rounder , this brush works a dream with foundation , mineral powders , blushers and face powders			0
@entity173 enough to pick up plenty of product and soft enough to blend beautifully , it 's a multi-tasking treat ! @entity176 blusher and bronzer can be two of the hardest products to apply			0
get it wrong , and you end up with clown - like blotches of pink on your cheeks or muddy streaks of bronze , and yet beautifully applied cheek colour really lifts your complexion , adding a warm , healthy glow			0
that 's why this brush is such a find			0
the hand - cut , domed head gives you complete control , allowing you to deposit colour exactly where you need it , while its fluffy @entity156 bristles ensure make - up is dispersed gently , without caking			1
i could n't be happier with my new brushes , thanks to which i 'm starting to feel as glamorously groomed as my @entity205 buddies			0
you 'll find a great selection of tools at my favourite online beauty store @entity209			0
i also have to give a shout out to one of my recent favourite products - the @entity213			0
with the temperatures rising here in @entity2 , i 've been using this as both a facial sun protector and a primer			1
as well as protecting my skin from @entity222 and uvb rays , this @entity220 cream also regulates sebum production - keeping spots and blemishes at bay - and mattifies the skin			0
finally , @entity229 is another skincare saviour that 's been helping me keep my complexion clear while in @entity2			2
whenever i feel a pesky spot rearing its ugly head , i dab a touch of this serum onto the area both morning and night			0
it leaves my skin looking clear and feeling fresh within just a few days			0
stay beautiful , love @entity0 xxx			2
