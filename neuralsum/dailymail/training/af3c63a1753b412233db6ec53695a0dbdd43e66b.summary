@entity9 and her husband @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , were given the devastating news during a sonogram in march that their baby boys were joined at the abdomen and shared vital organs			1
their own research only confirmed the couple 's fears - their babies only had a 5 per cent chance of living a healthy life if they were separated			2
the heartbroken parents considered a termination			0
' however the couple soon had a change of heart after a doctor convinced them that their boys , who shared a liver and intestines , had a fighting chance			1
a specialist at @entity52 renewed their faith , telling them : ' these boys have a really good chance			2
this is not your only option			0
' mrs @entity9 gave birth to conjoined boys @entity28 and @entity27 on july 15			1
doctors advised that separation surgery was possible but risky - out of eight similar operations , only once did both twins survive			1
the couple , who have two other sons , moved to @entity68 for the boys ' medical care and were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken into surgery			1
success : one of the twin boys shortly after an 11 - hour operation which successfully separated them ' as a mother , i hope i never have to experience a moment like that again , ' mrs @entity9 wrote in her ' @entity82 ' blog			1
on august 24 , an 11 - hour operation successfully separated the boys			1
at a news conference following the surgery , mrs @entity9 said : ' i have two babies … two separate babies ! ' her husband added : ' a couple of pretty good looking babies , i ’d say			2

brothers : conjoined twins @entity27 and @entity28 , pictured before their separation , have now been separated brotherly love : @entity9 watches as her eldest son @entity97 comforts his little brothers @entity27 and @entity28 , who shared a liver and some of their digestive system they will need further surgeries in the future ; after they are two , the boys will require ' skin expanders ' for their wounds			1
another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place , which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar			0
after this , if the parents wish , they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them			1
@entity119 : an ultrasound shows the boys attached at the abdomen while in @entity124 's womb early days : the babies shortly after their birth on july 15 roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins , according to the @entity130			2
around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn , and about 35 per cent survive only one day			0
the survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent , the @entity131 reported			0
the condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest , sharing organs			0
chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs , experts say			1
although success rates have improved over the years , surgical separation is still rare			0
since 1950 , at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time			0
after separation , most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines			0
although risky , there are many stories of successful separations			0
most recently , @entity161 twins @entity160 , who were born sharing an abdomen , pelvis , liver , kidney , large intestine and two legs , just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four			2
their family said the girls , who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics , are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been .			0
