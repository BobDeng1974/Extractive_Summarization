the entertainment for tourists on the coast of @entity4 , @entity0 is somewhat jaw - dropping			1
for this is where daredevil divers take to shanty wooden boards and dive some 100ft into the narrow pools of sea - water			2
@entity11 is a famous site where you can watch the skilled locals , as well as tourists , take their respective leaps of faith			2
the extent of the challenge is captured perfectly by the @entity20 camera locals take donations from tourists for attempting the death - defying dives in this incredible video shot with a @entity20 camera , one local takes the diving to another level			1
he spends about a minute taking in the surroundings and views as he perches aboard a self - made , wooden diving board			0
there are swimming pools , boats out to sea , tourists soaking up the sun , cliffs and trees , at the tranquil resort			0
the true extent of the challenge he will take on becomes apparent - not only is he 100ft above the sea , but a closer look at his entry point into the water is grim viewing - the view is punctuated by deep - lying rocks			0
a quick look into the lens , an exclamation of confidence , and then the @entity0 thrill - seeker leaps off the board , with camera in tow			2
while some people are contemplating more relaxing activities , this diver is ready for a challenge tourists can dive from 35ft or so ; the higher divers are left to the experts the daredevil local is safe and well after his cliff dive the speed of travel and entry leaves the view in a bit of a haze before the camera pans to some underwater shots - capturing the many rocks on the sea bed that the diver manages to dodge			1
' @entity20 no problem @entity0 ' shouts the delighted diver after bringing the camera to the surface			1
the action was captured after a tourist passed the camera to one of the skilled local divers			0
@entity11 on @entity4 , @entity0 , is a famous spot to watch cliff diving ' i 'm just a guy with a @entity20 who slipped a braver guy some bucks to jump off a rickety old platform , and then posted it on @entity98 , ' said the holidaymaker , named only as @entity100			1
' my wife @entity101 and i were on honeymoon and visited @entity11			0
' i believe the divers there make a living by being paid by offering tourists to dive with their @entity108			0

tourists ' treated ' at @entity11 , @entity4 , @entity0 , to daredevil cliff dives
seabed is punctured by rocks - dives have to be perfect
