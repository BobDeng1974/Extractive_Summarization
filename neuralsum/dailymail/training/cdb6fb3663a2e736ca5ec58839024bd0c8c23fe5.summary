@entity0 told sir @entity1 ' we need f * * * * * * more from you ' @entity5 says he would n't have missed a drugs test like @entity7 @entity0 admits he headbutted @entity8 in an alcohol - fuelled fight former @entity12 midfielder does not regret horror tackle on @entity14 @entity0 ' regrets apologising ' to @entity1 @entity5 also slams @entity1 for @entity17 dispute @entity0 has revealed he knew how good @entity18 was the first time he saw him play for @entity20			1
the @entity22 superstar played against @entity0 's @entity12 side in a friendly in 2003 , and sir @entity1 signed the 18 - year - old soon after his impressive display in @entity20 's 3 - 1 win			1
in his new autobiography @entity28 , out this week , @entity0 reminisces about the game , in particular the torrid time the @entity31 gave @entity12 defender @entity32			1
' we were playing @entity20 to celebrate the opening of their stadium			1
i saw how good @entity18 was that day			1
he was up against @entity38 , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity18 caused @entity32 to have ' dizzy spells ' when @entity20 faced @entity12 in a friendly , claims @entity0 in his autobiography ' @entity28 ' @entity18 ( right ) caused @entity32 ( left ) to require medical attention during the friendly before his move @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity18 ( right ) became team - mates after @entity12 signed @entity18 @entity0 says he ' knew ' that @entity18 would become one of the best players in the world one day @entity18 won the @entity48 in january 2014 as the world 's best player for the year ' @entity51 ended up seeing the doctor at half time because he was actually having dizzy spells			1
the club concluded negotiations after the game			2
' we always joked with @entity59 he had actually sealed the deal by playing like a f * * * * * * clown			2
in fairness to him , he was jet - lagged [ from @entity65 ] like the rest of us			2
' @entity0 also praised @entity18 's dedication and attitude , the legendary former hardman having played with the young forward for two years until @entity0 's acrimonious departure from @entity72 in 2005			1
' i liked @entity18 straight away			1
he had a nice presence about him and a good attitude , ' @entity0 said			1
' after watching him train for a few days i thought : “ this lad is going to be one of the best players in the world			2
” ' he was 17 but he was immediately one of the hardest working players at @entity12			1
he was good looking and he knew it			1
looking at some of the other players in front of the mirror i would think : " you f * * * * * * nugget "			2
but @entity18 had an innocence to him and a niceness			1
' like our @entity12 facebook page			1
' once we were at @entity91 – they were playing @entity92			2
we were standing at the corner flag and @entity94 ( @entity95 ) was next to me			2
he goes : " this is great is n’t it ? "			0
i went : " i used to play in these games @entity94 "			2
i was n’t being cocky			0
' it ’s about justification , what you stand for			0
when i was at @entity12 i was getting paid good money but i could go : " yeah , but i 'm giving it back to you "			1
i did n’t feel that way with this tv work			0
it ’s an easy gig			0
i do n’t like easy gigs			0
when i heard : " i liked your commentary last night "			0
i knew i was only talking bulls * * * like the rest of them			2
hopefully my bulls * * * was a bit better			0
i wanted to do something that excited me			0
tv work did n’t excite me			0
' i liked @entity94 and @entity120 , though			0
what i really enjoyed was the company			0
i liked meeting people , old players like @entity125 ’s @entity124			0
some @entity12 fans saw us together and one of them said : “ why the f * * * are you talking to him ? ”			1
i felt like saying : “ i will speak to who i f * * * ing want to ! " ' ' i wonder about the current @entity12 dressing room			1
when a manager like sir @entity1 is replaced the new man needs a helping hand			0
does that mean every player should like him ? no. ' but i look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better			0
not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best			0
' looking at what happened to @entity146 , i can only conclude that he did n’t have a strong dressing room			0
he had a weak dressing room			0
' @entity0 enjoyed 12 full seasons at @entity72 and was extremely successful during his time there @entity18 was also a success at @entity12 before completing a then world - record move to @entity22 @entity0 writes about the incident with @entity8 in his new autobiography @entity28 @entity0 : @entity28 , published by @entity157 , £ 20			1
