the terms and conditions on tickets for the @entity3 at @entity4 said the wearing of football shirts was forbidden in order not to stir up club rivalry			1
however , the nearest to a crowd disturbance after the final last sunday involved two @entity11 players @entity9 and @entity12 , who went to the event following the club ’s @entity15 third - round win at @entity17			1
witnesses report that a highly - agitated @entity9 had to be restrained by @entity12 after being taunted by football fans as he left the venue following @entity22 ’s victory			1
@entity11 winger @entity9 had to be restrained by team - mate @entity12 ( right ) @entity9 , pictured with @entity24 player @entity23 , attended the darts final on sunday @entity9 , whose high and wide penalty miss against @entity27 a year ago has been described as the worst ever , was said to have been eager to confront his hecklers head - on but he was sensibly bundled into a car by @entity12 and other friends			1
a @entity3 darts spokesman said : ‘ the two @entity4 players had paid for vip seats and they left the venue without incident			1
’ a spokesman for @entity11 did not dispute what happened but did not comment			1
the unusual kick - off time of 7.55pm for @entity41 ’s coverage of the @entity42 vs @entity44 tie on monday has prompted conspiracy theories about the @entity41 wanting to start the second half before the return of acclaimed series @entity48 on @entity50			1
host @entity51 urged viewers at the interval to stay with the @entity15 drama			2
however , the @entity41 insist the start time was planned to give them the required build - up period and that live games in previous rounds had the same schedule			1
@entity44 's @entity15 match against @entity42 kicked off at the unusual time of 7:55 @entity62 , blocked from a knighthood by the @entity64 because of his disputed conviction in @entity66 16 years ago for an alleged attack on former girlfriend @entity68 , would not have had his worthy cause helped by his choice of pr advisor in his legal fight against the @entity66 justice system			2
it was disgraced celebrity publicist @entity75 , jailed for eight years last may for a string of indecent assaults			2
@entity62 chose to employ @entity75 as his pr advisor during fight against the @entity66 justice system @entity81 chief @entity80 was seen deep in conversation with prince @entity83 in the gardens of the @entity85 during last month ’s @entity87 summit in @entity88 , but there is no @entity81 deal in place to support the @entity93 ’s candidature against @entity94 for the @entity87 presidency			2
prince @entity83 , who will struggle for votes even from within his own @entity98 confederation , will discover that @entity81 is split over @entity94 , who enjoys considerable support in @entity100			2
not having all @entity81 behind him was the reason @entity103 ’s @entity102 did not stand			2
@entity87 vice president @entity104 of @entity93 will run for football 's top job against @entity94 @entity107 goes star crazy the endless internal warfare within @entity107 now sees @entity111 ’s members irate that the management committee have given a preferential star to four candidates — including @entity115 — that they would most like to see elected from the seven standing for election			1
those snubbed include @entity118 , nominated by @entity119 and sir @entity120			0
@entity118 is standing for re-election and supports the aborted @entity123 redevelopment			0
vocal member @entity124 , in a letter to chairman @entity126 , describes the star system as ‘ authoritarian and secretive cronyism ’ , adding : ‘ any candidate who disagrees with the party line receives no starring			0
it is undemocratic , elitist and self - aggrandising			1
’ @entity115 , pictured at @entity42 , is among a list of four preferential candidates the @entity137 footballers ’ code of conduct , introduced in 2012 following a series of indiscretions , has been mothballed			0
but it will surely have to be dusted down for a decision on @entity144 ’s immediate international future if he is found guilty of drink driving			0
the @entity148 striker was stopped by police on the @entity150 in october but the @entity15 knew nothing about the arrest when he was called up in november			0
@entity144 was charged and will appear at @entity154 magistrates on january 19			0

@entity163 said : ‘ we had a laugh about it			0
i think it was just a flippant remark , but you never know with the chairman			0
’ @entity158 owner @entity159 joked that his driver @entity163 could be made president			0
