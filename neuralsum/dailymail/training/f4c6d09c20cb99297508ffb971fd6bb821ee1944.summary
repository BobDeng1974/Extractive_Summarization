by @entity0 across the globe , text slang is the bane of any teacher 's life			0
but this @entity7 college claims to have found a simple solution			0
using makeshift canvas ' phone lockers ' , teachers now order pupils to deposit their mobiles before class starts , in a desperate bid to stamp new ' modern ' words out of exam papers			1
confiscated : pupils are now phoneless in class at @entity20 as they must deposit mobiles in these holders incredibly , pupils have taken to the system with glee - teachers claim			1
it may be a move worth considering by heads of schools in @entity31 , as hundreds of teachers continue to complain about students ' diminishing language skills			1
last month , a poll of 500 teachers in @entity36 and @entity37 found that many youngsters used colloquialisms in formal written work , with phrases such as ' @entity42 was pure mental ' and ' @entity43 was a numpty was n't he ? '			0
according to @entity46 , dean of the @entity20 , the simple fabric hangers have made all the difference			2
the lockers were introduced at the @entity49 , in @entity50 , @entity7 , after teachers said ' most pupils ' were on @entity53 ( @entity54 ) ' most of the time ' during lessons			2
@entity46 , dean of the institute , said the ' visible reminder ' encourages a ' studying atmosphere '			0
@entity61 , dean of the college , said pupils are delighted with the system aimed at correcting their language the school brought in the ' lockers ' as they claimed phones were a danger to pupils ' health and intelligence she added : ' one only needs to look at the new words that are coming up to describe the distractions the kids are having , for example @entity79 for someone who is obsessed with the phone or @entity82 , which is snubbing the teacher by messing around on the phone			1
' we feel that this is damaging the kids development and also causes health problems			0
' by having a very visible reminder as they walk into each class that when they start their studies they leave their phones behind , it has really helped improve the studying atmosphere within the school			2
despite initial complaints , pupils now ' love ' the system , which stops them messaging during lessons ' the teacher has clear sight of the phones as well and watches when the phones are taken and collected at the beginning and end of each lesson to avoid any problems			1
' she added : ' i am not even convinced that having a class filled with 30 people and 30 phones and all giving off electro smog is particularly safe , i am sure it affects the ability to concentrate			0
' the reaction has been great from the students , and although at the start there were some instances where people seemed to forget to switch off their phones everyone now seems to have it correct - and it 's routine			1
