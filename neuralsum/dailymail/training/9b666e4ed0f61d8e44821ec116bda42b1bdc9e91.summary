by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 19:25 est , 10 september 2012 hospitals are sending hundreds of thousands of confidential letters about patients to @entity4 to be typed up by poorly - paid workers			1
@entity7 trusts have been accused of laying off their secretaries and instead dispatching patients ’ notes more than 6,000 miles to save money on staffing costs			2
in the last year , at least 650,000 letters containing sensitive medical information are known to have been sent to @entity4 by a total of eight trusts , but many others are likely to be doing the same			1
@entity16 warn that complicated medical terms may be mis - translated by the @entity4 workers leading to ‘ tragic consequences ’			1
outsourced : a series of @entity22 - area hospitals , including @entity23 ( pictured ) , has admitted using cheap secretarial agencies in @entity4 to type patient letters at least one hospital – @entity27 ’s in @entity28 – has already been forced to stop sending letters to @entity4 because the standard was so much worse			1
normally after seeing a patient a doctor dictates a referral letter to a consultant into a tape recorder , which is far quicker than typing it out			2
this is then given to the doctor ’s medical secretary who types it up and sends it , saving the doctor time			2
but recently hospitals have begun setting up schemes with private firms whereby the recordings are sent to @entity4 to be typed up and returned a few weeks later			1
figures obtained by @entity51 mp @entity50 under the @entity52 show that in 2011/12 , @entity54 trust in west @entity22 , sent 234,000 letters to @entity4			1
@entity23 trust in @entity22 sent 123,000 letters , while @entity59 trust in north @entity22 sent 137,000			2
last week the former health secretary @entity60 ( pictured ) admitted that his own local hospital , @entity27 's , had ended its contract because the quality of the letters coming back was poor other @entity7 trusts that said they routinely dispatch letters to @entity4 were : @entity68 in south - west @entity22 ; @entity69 and @entity70 in south @entity22 and @entity71 ; the @entity72 in north @entity22 ; the @entity73 in north @entity22			1
@entity74 and the @entity22 in east @entity75 also admitted dispatching letters in the last year but said it had stopped the practice in july			1
it did not provide a reason			2
several of the @entity7 trusts insist there is no risk that patients ’ confidentiality will be breached as their names and dates of birth are removed beforehand			0
but last week the former health secretary @entity60 admitted that his own local hospital , @entity27 ’s , had ended its contract because the quality of the letters coming back was poor			1
mr @entity50 , who raised the issue in the @entity93 last week , said : ‘ there is a safety issue			0
there ’s the potential for something to go tragically wrong			0
‘ if someone gives the wrong advice and this is not picked up then a patient could be misdiagnosed or seen less urgently than they should be			0
’ he added that it was ‘ outrageous ’ that @entity7 jobs were being outsourced abroad			0
‘ unemployment in the @entity107 is at unacceptable levels and the economy is suffering the worst double dip recession since the @entity111 , ’ he said			0
‘ medical secretaries are being downgraded or laid off			0
this is work that could easily be based and carried out in the @entity107 , maintaining jobs and keeping opportunities for our young people			0
’ mr @entity50 has not yet received replies from all @entity7 trusts in @entity119 but he suspects others are also sending letters abroad			0
recently it has also emerged that a number of primary care trusts – which oversee gp services – have also been sending patient letters abroad			0
at least 46 @entity127 have signed a deal with a private firm which involves having some of their administrative and secretarial work outsourced to @entity4			1
several gps have reported errors and in one case confidential information about patients was sent to the wrong @entity127			0
