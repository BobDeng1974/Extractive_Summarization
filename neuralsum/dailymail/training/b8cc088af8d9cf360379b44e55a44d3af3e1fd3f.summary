slim down : @entity2 , the 16 - year - old number one junior tennis player in the world , pictured today the @entity16 , has been told to loose weight by the @entity6 @entity30 , the general manager of the @entity6 's player development program told the @entity32 : ' our concern is her long - term health , number one , and her long - term development as a player			1
' we have one goal in mind : for her to be playing in [ @entity42 ] in the main draw and competing for major titles when it 's time			0
that 's how we make every decision , based on that			0
' her mother , @entity49 , who paid her daughter 's travel expenses to the @entity16 herself , said she was confused by the @entity6 's decision , because after all , her daughter ' is no. 1 , not just in the @entity55 , but in the world			1
' ' it all kind of came as a shock to us because @entity2 has consistently done quite well , ' she said			2
however the @entity6 's decision seems to illustrate that its priorities lie in the importance of developing long - term fitness , successful results and longevity , rather than purely competitive results , in the hope of boosting the current decline of @entity55 tennis			2
' you have to be fit , but you do n't have to look ripped ' earlier this summer , miss @entity2 lost in the first round of qualifying for a professional event in @entity73 , and her coaches asked her to withdraw from the @entity76 ' @entity75 in @entity77 , return to the @entity79 - based academy and embark on a more strenuous fitness program			2
however , winning competitive tennis matches does not necessarily directly correlate to having a svelte figure			0

' while @entity95 , a polite and professional teenager who said she is dutifully doing ' everything they ask ' her to do , was asked to represent the @entity55 in a junior @entity114 event in @entity115 later this month , her future schedule will remain up to the @entity6			1
mr @entity30 said : ' we 'll assess when this tournament is over			0
' ' i 've gotten a lot of great opportunities , great fitness , great coaching , ' @entity118 said of the @entity6			0
