@entity26 : photographer @entity9 captured this striking image of an alpha male lion prowling across the wild fields of @entity14 @entity30 : a yellow billed stork at sunrise can be seen flying across the @entity3 plains as the sky lightens up behind mr @entity9 , who works as a freelance photographic guide on safari , took the shots at sunrise and sunset			1
they include a herd of elephants fresh from swimming across a river or enjoying a dust bath and a giraffe appearing to dwarf the bright sun. mr @entity9 , from @entity48 , said : ' i love the colour in the images			1
a lot of photographers only want sunlight but i feel there are many opportunities after the sun has set or the light has gone			0
born to be wild : silhouettes of elephants as they march across the @entity3 terrain near the @entity63 river in @entity64 on the prowl : photographer @entity9 captured these two @entity66 as the sun begins to set in the horizon ' for me a silhouette tells a story and there is something special about capturing the moment in time just before the sun has gone but there are still great colours in the sky			1
' i need to be very accurate with my exposures otherwise i can lose the colour in the sky and i enjoy the challenge of getting the exposure right and still having a sharply focused image and a nice composition			0
' the light fades very fast at sunset and it gets bright very quickly at sunrise so the window of opportunity is very small - but i love the challenge			2
' love birds : two doves can be seen perched on a branch as the sun rises in the background dwarfing the sun : a giraffe appears to tower over the sun as it sets , pictured left , and a @entity101 looks content watch the evening descend , pictured right mr @entity9 photographed the giraffe and @entity101 from a boat in the @entity63 river , @entity64			1
and the elephants were taken soon after they had stopped at the water 's edge to drink			2
mr @entity9 said : ' a few of the elephants had a bit of a dust bath on their way back to the woodland , creating this beautiful moment			1
' it was dry and dusty and i love the way the colour , the dust and the silhouettes of the ' ellies ' combine			0
this family scene is one of my best images			2
' a cheetah is pictured sniffing the ground as clouds slowly disperse on a cool morning , allowing rays of sunlight to break through			0
lone ranger : this elephant appears to have broken away from its herd in this image taken by photographer @entity9 early riser : this silhouette shows a @entity66 waking up as the clouds start to disperse to reveal rays of sunshine on a cool morning the @entity143 eaters were spotted at a nesting colony home to thousands of birds , flying around and squawking			1
mr @entity9 saw the lion on a chilly , cloudy morning			2
he said : ' we were on a drive and saw this lion with the amazing sun and clouds behind him			0
' we got into position a few minutes before he got up and i was able to capture this image of him			0
i think the sun and cloud in the sky look brilliant , with him lifting his paw in the air			0
' i love the fact that it is a powerful animal with a beautiful sunrise , the colours in the sky are great			0
