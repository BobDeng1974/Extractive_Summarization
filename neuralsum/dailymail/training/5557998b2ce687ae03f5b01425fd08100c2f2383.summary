@entity0 has to be in the @entity2 squad next month			1
he ’s made the step at every level			1
@entity2 is the next natural stage of his development			1
to play in his first north @entity8 derby and score twice is extraordinary			1
when you ’re looking at a youngster , you bring them into first - team training to see what they can do against your experienced players			2
and if he copes with that , you take the next step and put him on the pitch			2
then you find out for real and the player finds out as well			2
@entity23 striker @entity0 has shown he is capable of being in the spotlight by impressing against @entity25 @entity23 academy graduate @entity0 roars in celebration after scoring his first derby goal @entity0 races away to celebrate after he equalised in the second half at @entity30 @entity0 has progressed bit by bit			1
he ’s been able to reproduce in the first team everything he ’s done in the youth team and under 21s			2
then the confidence comes and suddenly you have a player			2
i love the fact that for the first goal against @entity25 , the minute the ball came off the hand of @entity44 , he ’s reacting			2
there was no tightness or freezing up			0
he knew exactly where he was going			0
he had scored in that split second			1
he was relaxed and put it away			0
he has a little bit of everything			0
he can play in the pocket and up top and his movement is very cute			0
for the second goal , if he had n’t moved to the side of @entity56 , he would n’t get the chance to score that great header			1
the 21 - year - old has previously impressed for @entity2 's @entity62 side @entity63 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) have also been in impressive form in recent weeks it was a fantastic performance all round from @entity23			1
their intensity and tempo was superb throughout the 90 minutes			0
there are three players who have elevated them this season : one is @entity0 , another is @entity63 but the third is @entity64			1
he ’s one of the best in the country at going past a player			0
but if he does it in a deep position , he ’s not the same threat as when he plays behind the striker			1
i feel he ’s more suited to that position than @entity63 , because the formation they have at the moment allows @entity63 to drift in from wide positions			0
they ’ve found a balance in those front players			0
i ’d play @entity91 ahead of @entity92 , but the formula is working well at the moment			0
and the full backs , @entity96 and @entity97 , are absolutely key			0
they have the energy to provide width and they release @entity63 and @entity92 to come inside , which is crucial to the balance of the team			0
if they can keep those two fit and fresh , then @entity23 may be able to negotiate upcoming @entity107 games and keep on track for the top four .			1
