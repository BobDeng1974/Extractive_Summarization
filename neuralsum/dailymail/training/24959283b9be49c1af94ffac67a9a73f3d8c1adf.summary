he then adjourned the hearing until next week so further inquiries could be made into the logistics of using the device			0
earlier , the court was told @entity1 was a flight risk because he held property leases in a country with which @entity44 had no extradition treaty			0
but it was also argued he was unlikely to abandon his family , who are standing by him			2
the court heard his wife had offered $ 500,000 surety while his mother was willing to put up $ 200,000			2
@entity24 appeared in court for a bail hearing he has pleaded guilty to five counts of indecent assault , five of indecency and one assault with indecency along with the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child the judge suggested that to lessen @entity1 's ability to abscond , his liquid assets be frozen			1
however , defence barrister @entity17 said his client did not have access to significant amounts of cash as his money was tied up in property and superannuation			0
