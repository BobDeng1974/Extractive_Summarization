the most reverend @entity10 said that remarks on church schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not ‘ be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy '			1
the retreat followed his assurance to journalists that ‘ there ’s a steady move away from faith - based entry tests ’ for children hoping for places at @entity25 ’s schools			1
it was the third occasion in nine months in which @entity10 has made a controversial statement , only to soften his line later in the face of wide publicity			2
in march he modified his criticism of the government over benefit reforms and during the summer , and during the summer the archbishop struck out at payday lenders , only to have to admit a ‘ serious inconsistency ’ when it was discovered that the @entity25 held investments in @entity38			1
archbishop @entity10 ’s views on changes in @entity25 schools were given to @entity43 during a conference held by the @entity45			1
the paper reported that he said : ‘ what you are seeing in the @entity25 schools is a deeper and deeper commitment to the common good			1
‘ there ’s a steady move away from faith - based entry tests			1
’ cofe schools - the @entity25 is responsible for one in four primaries and one in 25 state secondary schools - have a high reputation and middle - class parents are often anxious to win places for their children			1
families are frequently accused of filling the pews on sunday mornings to solely to impress vicars , who give preference to regular churchgoers			0
critics say the system encourages hypocrisy and is a form of selection , because it favours the children of largely middle class congregations			0
archbishop @entity10 - an old @entity73 whose five children went to state schools - told @entity43 : ‘ it is not necessary to select to get a really good school			1
‘ there are unbelievably brilliant schools that are entirely open to all applicants without selection criteria apart from residence , where you live , and which produce staggeringly good results			2
‘ it ’s a question of - and you can point to them all over the place - it ’s a question of outstanding leadership			2
’ however shortly after his remarks were published , the archbishop reversed direction			0
he put out a statement that said : ‘ i fully support the current policy for schools to set their own admissions criteria , including the criterion of faith			2
nothing in my wider comments to @entity43 on this subject should be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy			0
’ the statement left a question mark over archbishop @entity10 ’s thinking and provoked demands for reform from critics of the selection procedures of church schools			1
the @entity111 , which aims to remove ‘ religious discrimination ’ from school admissions , said the @entity25 should fulfil promises to keep a quarter of school places open for non-churchgoing families , and re-write its guidance on admissions to encourage the acceptance of pupils from a wider range of backgrounds			1
the group ’s spokesman , rabbi dr @entity123 , said : ‘ the archbishop ’s comment that schools better serve the common good by being open in their admissions , is a breath of fresh air			2
however , the @entity25 has made commitments towards greater inclusivity at its schools in recent years , but not delivered , and it remains to be seen whether church schools really are shifting in their approach in pupil admissions			2
‘ @entity138 needs to offer clear leadership to bring about a lasting cultural change			0
’ @entity10 said that remarks on church schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not ' be seen as revealing any changes nor dissenting from current policy ' in march archbishop @entity10 opposed the government ’s one per cent cap on benefit increases , saying : ‘ these changes will mean it is children and families who will pay the price for high inflation , rather than the government			1
politicians have a clear choice			0
by protecting children from the effects of this @entity159 , they can help fulfil their commitment to end child poverty			0
’ however , hours afterwards , he wrote a blog on the @entity164 website which sounded a different note			0
‘ it ’s a very complicated area , and the first thing to say is that the current secretary of state for work and pensions , @entity169 , has spent hard years turning himself into a leading and principled expert on welfare , its effects and shortcomings , ’ the @entity10 said in the blog			1
‘ he is introducing one of the biggest and most thorough reforms of a system that most people admit is shot full of holes , wrong incentives , and incredible complexity			0
’ in july the archbishop attacked payday lenders , saying : ‘ i ’ve met the head of @entity38 and we had a very good conversation and i said to him quite bluntly , “ we ’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence , we ’re trying to compete you out of existence ”			0
’ shortly afterwards a newspaper reported that the @entity192 , the financial arm of the @entity25 , had money in one of @entity38 ’s major backers			2
@entity164 said : ‘ we are grateful to the @entity197 for pointing out this serious inconsistency of which we were unaware			0
‘ we will be asking the assets committee of the @entity192 to investigate how this has occurred and to review the holding			0

@entity10 said remarks on schools in which he suggested radical changes were on the way should not ‘ be seen as revealing any changes ’
retreat followed assurance that ‘ there ’s a steady move away from faith - based entry tests ’ for children hoping for places at @entity25 ’s schools
