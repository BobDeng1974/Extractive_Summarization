@entity2 just is n't content with being one of the best wingers in the world , the @entity1 maestro clearly fancies his chances in goal , too			2
the 25 - year - old was training with his @entity12 team - mates ahead of their @entity14 qualifying match against @entity15 and , instead of putting balls in the back of the net , the former @entity9 star tried his hand at stopping them			1
those at @entity21 can only wish they had n't traded @entity2 for Â £ 85million now as they sit 12th in the @entity24 , and the forward can make his former fans wince even more when he takes to the pitch in @entity28 on sunday evening			1
a win for @entity15 would see @entity52 ' side leapfrog @entity12 , though @entity29 is confident the points are there for the taking			1
' we go into the game in @entity28 on the back of only one defeat in eight games now , ' said @entity29			0
' we are up against a very good @entity15 side , @entity62 quarter finalists and ranked fourth in the world at the moment			2
' but we are a good side as well			2
we have an excellent squad , a tremendous squad spirit and mentality			1
we have proved that in the campaign to date , and especially over the past couple of home matches			0
' the support from the fans has been incredible			0
last year we took nearly 1,500 to @entity28			0
this time we will be taking nearly two and a half thousand and could have taken far more			0
we want to repay them in the best way possible , with a positive performance and result			0
' a win for @entity15 would see @entity52 ' side leapfrog @entity12 but manager @entity29 ( above ) is confident they can take points			1

@entity2 and his @entity12 team - mates take on @entity15 on sunday evening in @entity14 qualifying match
wales sit top of @entity45 after three games , having beaten @entity47 and @entity48 , and drawn with @entity49
@entity12 manager @entity29 : ' we are a good side as well . we have an excellent squad , a tremendous squad spirit '
