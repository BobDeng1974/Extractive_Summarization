by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has fled to the @entity3 to start a three - month course of rehabilitation in a new attempt to kick her drug demons			1
the actress left the @entity9 on saturday night , before a sunday newspaper broke the news that she was once again using cocaine			1
in the tell - all interview , she revealed that she had turned to the highly - addictive drug six times since the relationship with her toy boy fiance @entity17 , 24 , started to break down in april and had even ended up sleeping with her drug dealer			1
she said : ' i 'm not where i was with drugs ( at my lowest point ) , but it was a case of how long it would be until i was - that 's what i was really frightened about			2
' i spoke to a family member a couple of weeks before it came out and said i was scared of relapsing			2
' then soon as my agent got a call saying the story is breaking , i told him i needed to get help			0
' the newspapers have done me a favour - the first thing i said to the journalist was , " thank you very much because you 've done me a huge favour			0
" ' they helped because the thing i was most frightened of saying was that i was doing drugs , i was most fearful about how i 'd cope with the backlash of everything if i came out about it			0
' it has been a huge weight lifted for me			0
' i 've had a terrible time in the last year , which is no excuse , but i 've just felt so broken and a lot of the time have been on the verge of breakdown			1
the actress turned to cocaine in april after relationship problems with her fiance @entity73 ( pictured ) ' i was in the wrong place at the wrong time , i was weak and took drugs and i 'm ashamed of that			2
' the mother - of - two blamed her relapse on an incredibly difficult last year that had seen the breakdown of her marriage and the loss of her family home			1
she had also been thrust into the limelight after revealing last year that she had been the victim of a gang rape in 1994 during the height of her initial drug use			1
she said : ' i knew what i was doing was wrong , i know that when i started drinking when things got heavier for me that it was inevitable that i would pick up drugs , it was just a question of when			0
' the people around me could see it too			0
' i thought i could be the one percent of people who would never pick up drugs again and i was wrong			0
' this last year has been a big deal for me ; losing my marriage was hard for me , being robbed , losing my house , moving my kids into a bedsit , it was all very hard for me			2
' i thought talking about the rape would be a good thing for me and i 've actually really not dealt with it very well either			0
' @entity2 then broke down into tears as she revealed the terrible effect being back on cocaine has had on her relationship with her family			1
she said : ' i told my mum three weeks ago at her house but i have n't spoken to her since			1
' my younger brother - i spoke to him this morning and i know i 've broken his heart			0
' drugs are always evil			0
' the star escaped the country on saturday night , just a couple of hours before the news of her relapse hit the news stands			1
pictured here in march before the relapse , @entity2 had been clean for several years and many believed she had managed to turn her life around she has spent the last few days reconnecting with her religion , getting therapy and attending @entity129 meetings			1
she said : ' i knew when the story broke that i needed to get back to @entity131 , to be with the church			1
' the first time i got clean was here in the @entity131 12 years ago			0
' when i arrived in the country on saturday night , my pastor 's wife picked me up and i was in church the next morning , then back in again that evening and i 'll be back there tonight			2
' i 'm not actually in ( residential ) rehab , i 'm staying at a house , but i 'm doing a lot of meetings here and i know a lot of people here with a lot of clean time - like 30 years			0
' there are also a lot of people in meetings who have been clean and relapsed who are within recovery again , so it 's a place where recovery is celebrated			0
@entity2 's initial addiction to cocaine led to her nasal septum rotting away ' so i 'm seeing therapists , going to meetings and feeling hugely positive			1
' i think where i went wrong was i did n't stay in meetings or therapy , i have n't been in meetings for six years			2
' so now i think i 've resorted to the knowledge that i will need it in my life day - to - day , always			0
' in the late 1990s , @entity2 was warned that she would die in the space of two weeks if she did not quit her Â£ 400 - a - day cocaine binges			1
her addiction led to her being sacked from her role as @entity169 on @entity170 and she suffered from several overdoses during her battle with the drug			2
she famously snorted such industrial amounts of cocaine that her nasal septum completely rotted away and had to have a pioneering operation which involved an implant of shark cells to repair her nose			0
@entity2 also lost three teeth because of her habit , while others crumbled under the chemical onslaught .			1

@entity2 , 40 , says she has n't spoken to her mum since she first broke news
blames a *tumultuous* year for relapse that saw her binge on drug six times
has turned back to religion to try and *rid* herself of demons once and for all
