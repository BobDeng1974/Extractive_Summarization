do you always take off your make - up before bed ? every night ? even after a glass of wine too many ? or when you 've fallen asleep on the sofa ? or you simply could n't muster the energy ? you 're not alone			1
in a recent survey , a third of women questioned confessed to sleeping with their slap on at least twice a week			1
yet those very same women did so despite believing that skipping their skincare routine before bedtime would give them spots , dry their skin and make their eyelashes brittle			1
before and after : experts said @entity21 's skin aged by ten years as a result of not removing her make - up for an entire month they even said they thought it would age their faces by more than two days for every night that they did n't bother			1
so if we think that such slovenliness is that bad for our skin , why are n't we more assiduous about cleansing ? in my case it comes down to priorities			2
on any given evening , my ' to do ' list ( which can be tackled only once the children , aged four and seven , are asleep at 8.30pm ) includes loading and unloading the dishwasher ( several times ) , tidying toys away and answering emails			2
then there 's the washing , filling in homework diaries , sorting school uniform and coaxing our contrary cat out from behind the garage			0
all this means that make - up removal frequently falls off the bottom of the list			1
but how much harm can a bit of war paint really do ? is n't this just another example of beauty companies scaremongering in a bid to flog us yet more skincare products we could possibly do without ? to find out , i took up the challenge of leaving my make - up on not just for a night , but for a whole month			1
i would give my face a cursory wash in the shower each morning but i would be allowed to use none of my usual cleansing creams , and would have to reapply new make - up over the remnants of the old each day			1
about face : sleeping with her make - up on for a month left @entity21 's smooth skin looking cracked and red in order to measure any changes in my skin statistically rather than subjectively , i went to see @entity75 at the @entity76 , based at the @entity77 just off @entity78			1
@entity75 analysed my face using a special 3d camera which shows - in mortifying detail - my pigmentation , broken veins , enlarged pores and wrinkles			2
my flaws were then compared against the average woman of my age ( 40 , since you ask ) to give me a percentage score			0
suspecting that make - up worn overnight for a protracted spell might prove very drying , @entity75 also took moisture readings across my cheeks and lower and upper forehead			1
and then the experiment began			0
although there was a temptation to be circumspect , knowing that i would n't be able to take my make - up off , i followed my usual routine			1
on went the @entity102 foundation , the @entity104 mascara and the @entity106 eyeliner , finished off with a slick of @entity109 lipgloss			0
night one , and after a hot , sticky day that included commuting back and forth across @entity111 on the @entity112 ( always a surefire way to make skin feel filthy ) , i was desperate to cleanse and moisturise			1
but i hid my trusty @entity116 creamy cleanser in a high cupboard and went to bed in full make - up			1
the following morning my pillowcase seemed to have suffered more than my skin			2
other than having rather itchy eyes and some stubborn clumps of mascara hanging on to my lashes like limpets , i appeared relatively unscathed			0
after my morning wash , i slathered on some moisturiser , and added another layer of make - up			1
by night three , however , it was a different picture			0
i had developed a series of tiny white cysts around my eyelashes and my skin was so dry and taut , it felt like a mask			2
by the weekend , a few friends had commented that i was looking tired			0
close inspection of my skin in a magnifying mirror revealed the surface had become flaky and lumpy , a bit like a badly plastered wall			2
moreover , the foundation that i had once loved looked dry and crepey on my skin			2
in a bid to rehydrate my parched face , once or twice i tried putting moisturiser over the surface of the make - up at night			1
but this served only to smear it in a wider arch across the pillowcase			0
my eyelashes , meanwhile , seemed to have stuck together into two giant mono - lashes , meaning applying further mascara was getting difficult			2
on several occasions i caught myself pulling eyelashes out in clumps and became genuinely concerned that they might all come out			0
one particularly scary morning , around ten days in , i woke up to find my left eye so swollen , i could barely open it			0
an optician friend assured me i 'd simply caught a mascara - laden lash in it overnight and it would soon settle down			2
mercifully he was right , but i did skip eye make - up for 48 hours after			1
i 'm all for experimentation , but not if it actually blinds me			0
as weeks progressed , my lips became dry and my skin cracked painfully at the corners of my mouth			2
with the end of the month approaching , i felt truly grubby and fed up			1
i had developed an intense aversion to mascara application and feared i may have done permanent damage to my skin			2
i had visibly blocked and enlarged pores all over my nose , dry skin across my lips and cheeks and red eyelids			2
the white cysts had given way to some nasty - looking eyelash dandruff			2
for an objective assessment , i went back to @entity75 's 3d camera and asked dermatologist dr @entity187 , medical director of the @entity189 clinic , to explain the results			0
not quite sleeping beauty : in a recent survey , a third of women questioned said they sleep with their slap on at least twice a week @entity196 the camera showed that the surface texture of my skin was around ten per cent worse ( i.e. more uneven ) on my forehead and on the right hand side			1
on the left hand side , it was around 20 per cent worse , which @entity75 explained was probably down to the fact that i sleep on my left side			2
this meant that even less oxygen would get to the skin here , which would magnify any problems that the lingering make - up might have caused			1
according to dr @entity187 , the decline in texture was almost certainly down to me skipping my twice - daily moisturising routine			2
this resulted in seriously parched skin , a fact proven by @entity75 's other tests , which showed a five per cent drop in moisture levels			0
' not only is the top layer of skin dry , ' said dr @entity187 , ' but a layer of make - up will also prevent normal skin shedding , slowing down the usual renewal process , resulting in uneven and dull textured skin			1
' all lined up although the wrinkles on my forehead had n't worsened significantly , they had become deeper on both the right and left hand sides of my face			0
dr @entity187 said that it 's no coincidence these were also the driest parts of my face			0
' when skin is dry , it 's less elastic so wrinkles are more prominent , ' she told me			0
she also believes that this dryness would have been compounded by environmental pollutants sticking to the make - up , causing what is known as oxidative stress , where skin is attacked by harmful free radicals			1
' these molecule - sized compounds cause damage to various cellular structures in the skin and can actually decrease production of collagen - the substance that gives skin its plumpness - compounding the wrinkle issue , ' she explained			1
walking the line : while the wrinkles on @entity21 's forehead had n't worsened significantly , they had become deeper on both sides of her face seeing red my skin is sensitive and prone to redness anyway			1
this meant that even before the experiment , i scored in the bottom six per cent of women my age			0
a month in , and it had become two percentage points worse			0
any more of a downward slide and i would be an off - the - scale mass of angry , dilated facial capillaries			0
dr @entity187 told me this redness was a sign of irritation in the skin			0
' sleeping in make - up , ' she warned , ' has an occlusive effect ( it forms a barrier over the surface of the skin )			1
' this means any irritants are locked in , exacerbating any allergic reactions , and moisturisers are locked out			0
' @entity288 deep cleanse : long - term avoidance of washing while continuing to wear make - up is detrimental to skin in the long run the pictures showed that my pores were about five per cent larger than they had been at the start			1
dr @entity187 said this was partly due to physical clogging			0
' dirt in pores not only makes them more noticeable and thus appear larger but , over time , we think it can actually stretch them			0
' however , she also believed that it was a sign that my skin had aged over the month			1
' older people naturally have larger pores because , with age , elasticity decreases so the structures that support the skin , and keep pores tight , become slacker			0
' @entity316 the experts estimated that my skin was biologically approximately a decade older than before i began my no - cleansing experiment			1
this proved what my mirror reflected : my face genuinely has aged by as much as ten years in a month , and all because i did n't take my make - up off			1
i 'm terrified that the damage might be permanent			0
have i ruined my skin - and my looks - for ever ? fortunately , @entity78 cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity328 reassured me			1
' you wo n't have done any meaningful damage in four weeks , ' she said			0
' but long - term avoidance of cleansing while continuing to wear make - up could be detrimental to your skin in the long - run			1
' the biggest issue is the accumulation of environmental pollutants , which drive the generation of free radicals			0
' these contribute to the breakdown of collagen and elastin , the structures that underpin youthful skin			0
while these structures deteriorate with age , you do n't want to do anything to speed up that process , ' she adds i do n't need telling twice			0
from now on , however busy i am before bed , cleansing will be number one on my to - do list .			0

a recent survey reveals a third of us sleep with our slap on twice weekly
so for a month , @entity21 applied make - up as normal - but never took it off !
by the end , experts said her skin had aged by a decade
