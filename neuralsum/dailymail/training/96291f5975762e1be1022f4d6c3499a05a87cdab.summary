@entity1 's high - class escorts are refusing to have sex with the nation 's bankers - until they open up credit lines to cash - strapped families and firms			1
@entity10 's top - end prostitutes say their indefinite strike will continue until bank employees ' fulfil their responsibility to society ' and start offering bigger loans for struggling @entity1 , it has been claimed			1
sneaky bankers were trying to circumvent the protest by claiming to be architects or engineers , the sex - workers said			1
on strike : @entity1 's high - class escorts are refusing to have sex with the nation 's bankers until they open up credit lines to cash - strapped families and firms ( file picture ) plans : a general strike , like this one in @entity28 in 2010 , is taking place across @entity1 on thursday in protest against austerity measures but this was ' not fooling anyone ' because , as one escort revealed : ' it has been many years since these professionals could afford rates that start from â‚¬ 300 per hour			1
' the capital 's largest luxury prostitute trade association , which is reportedly initiating the strike , said : ' we are the only ones with a real ability to pressure the sector			0
' we have been on strike for three days now and we do n't think they can withstand much more , ' added the woman , known as @entity46 it said the move came after one of its members , @entity51 , pressured a bank employee client to grant a loan by halting her ' sexual services '			0
tough talker : @entity1 prime minister @entity57 ( left ) said he will still pass an austere budget on friday , the day after thousands will take to the streets as part of a general strike ( right ) @entity64 website @entity62 , who was joined by @entity66 in breaking the news which some have claimed is a ' hoax ' , reported that the bankers became so desperate they called in the government for mediation			1
the strikes also come as @entity1 's prime minister @entity57 promised this week to stick to a tough budget			1
this was despite a surprise setback in a regional election he had hoped would reinforce his mandate for spending cuts to improve public finances			0
his @entity84 party won the @entity86 stronghold of @entity87 in sunday 's vote but did not secure the outright majority that was expected and that would have reinforced his mandate to make savings			0
but @entity57 said he would still present a tough 2012 budget for this year on friday			1
he must set out how @entity1 will cut the public deficit to 5.3 % of its output this year , from 8.51 % last year			2
' we will pass a very , very austere budget , ' he told reporters in @entity98 , where he was attending a nuclear summit			0
@entity57 's reforms have won some public support from voters who want to make sure @entity1 is not forced to ask for a bailout like neighbouring @entity104			2
the sex - worker strike comes as @entity1 is set to be hit by a general strike on thursday in protest at high unemployment and changes to labour laws that make it cheaper for firms to lay off workers			1
train , bus and air traffic will be severely limited as unions , which represent one in five @entity1 workers , agreed to retain minimum transport services			2
it will mean only 20 per cent of flights between @entity1 and other @entity123 airports			2
the government 's labour market reform is just the latest in a series of measures @entity1 has taken in the last two years to try to make its economy more competitive			2
doubts about @entity1 's public finances have pushed up the state 's borrowing costs , forcing the government to drastically cut spending to reduce the public deficit			0
at the same time , unemployment has soared to a staggering 23 per cent and the economy is heading into its second recession in three years			0
a general strike in 2010 had limited impact - mostly on transport and manufacturing - but this week 's walkout could bring a bigger turnout because the jobless rate has increased significantly			1
also , in 2010 the @entity146 were in power , and now the centre - right @entity84 is in office			0
traditionally , the unions have had a political alliance with the @entity146 so protests have been more muted during periods of @entity86 rule			0
in a country where people depend heavily on public transport to get to work , the unions depend on cutting transport services to obtain maximum impact from a strike .			0
