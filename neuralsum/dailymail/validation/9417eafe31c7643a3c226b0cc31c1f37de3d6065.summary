three children from a remote mountain village in @entity2 travel on horseback for three hours a day in order to attend their nearest school			1
the eight - year - olds endure the 16km round trip every day accompanied by their elderly grandparents - who walk for six hours a day to ensure their grandchildren get the education they themselves were denied			1
the grandparents of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 take the children from their remote home in @entity18 village to school every day on horseback , leading the animals along the muddy , rocky and winding track 1,300m above sea level			1
the grandparents take it in turns to lead the horses along the trail , which is 1,300 metres above sea level the journey can be dangerous , particularly when it is icy - then the children have to stay at home the children , all from the @entity34 ethnic minority group , are all ' left - behind children ' - which means their parents have left them in the care of their grandparents while they look for work in towns and cities miles from their village homes			1
the @entity43 reports the youngsters have ridden the horses along the muddy and often dangerous road to school for the last three years			1
all three youngsters are in @entity49 at @entity51 elementary school			2
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 are all aged just eight - and travel 16km a day to school @entity14 ( left ) said she loves going to school by horse - and all her friends are jealous of her transport the muddy road from @entity18 to @entity60 village was only built in 2010 , supported by government grants and can not carry cars			1
the school has just one teacher , who has worked there alone for five years , teaching two classes with 19 students in total			2
@entity69 , @entity13 's 60 - year - old grandfather , has been using a horse to carry his grandson to school since @entity13 started preschool three years ago			2

during busy seasons for farmers one elderly person takes all three children to school on behalf of the three families			1
the children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they can not carry umbrellas when it rains after arriving at school , the horses are tied in front of the school 's field to graze and the elderly people return to their village			1
at 3pm the grandparents walk back to the school to take the children home			1

the children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they can not carry umbrellas when it rains			2
@entity69 said : ' rain will wet their clothes and shoes , so we use plastic sheets to cover the kids and then take them slowly on the horses to school			1
' but when the weather takes a turn for the worst and the mountain pass freezes it becomes too slippery and dangerous to travel on			1
when that happens the children are forced to stay at home			2
the school has just one teacher , who works there alone , teaching two classes with 19 pupils @entity14 's grandmother said that @entity14 ( pictured ) is clever , sensible and studious the tiny school has just one teacher and two classes - eight - year - old @entity14 came first in her class @entity69 said : ' we all hope that they study hard and become promising in the future			0

children from remote village in @entity2 must travel 16km to nearest school
journey is too long for them to walk so three children share two horses
their grandparents walk six hours a day to ensure children get to school
but the mountain road can be dangerous especially when it becomes icy
