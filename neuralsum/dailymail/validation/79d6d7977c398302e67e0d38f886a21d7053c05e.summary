@entity0 said tougher sanctions are needed for those caught making calls , sending texts and checking emails while driving drivers who use mobile phones at the wheel should be banned from the roads , @entity7 ’s top traffic officer said yesterday			1
@entity0 insisted that a rise in offending showed much tougher punishments were needed to deter the worst culprits			1
but she claimed ministers were too scared of losing votes in may ’s election to act against the estimated 500,000 motorists who break the law every day			1
the @entity22 chief constable said the absence of proper penalties risked making it socially acceptable to text or surf the internet while driving			1
the offence of using a hand - held mobile at the wheel currently attracts only a £ 100 fine with three penalty points			2
miss @entity0 said : ‘ if someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications			1
‘ if we do n’t do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this			2
' i have had those conversations with ministers			2
i would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement			1
the minister does n’t like my proposal			1
’ asked why ministers had rejected her call , she told the @entity52 : ‘ probably timing ’s not great			2
i do n’t think it would be popular with lots of people			0
' an election is not too far away so i ’m sure they ’re not likely to pick up and run with anything that they feel is not likely to be helpful to them in the next election			1
’ miss @entity0 , who speaks on road issues for the @entity63 , said drivers repeatedly glancing at their smartphones were effectively using a computer			1
her intervention follows the release of figures last week showing that mobile offending has risen despite numerous crackdowns			0
@entity72 , @entity73 transport minister , rejected the claim that he was blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons			1
some 1.6 per cent of @entity7 's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009 he insisted the @entity84 was reviewing the introduction of a six - point penalty , two instances of which would trigger a ban			1
and he turned his fire on the police , saying chief constables were too quick to take the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers			0
‘ one of the reasons people do these things is because they think they can get away with it , ’ he said			0
‘ it is important that police and crime commissioners and chief constables look at the resources they put into this as opposed to other more easy offences to detect like speeding where cameras can catch people on an industrial scale			0
‘ there is no point increasing the penalties if we are not actually catching people			0
’ research shows that the distraction effect of using a mobile phone is worse than being over the limit on drink or drugs			1
but the penalties are far lower – unless motorists are convicted of careless or dangerous driving			1
and official figures show that the number of fixed penalty notices has fallen 26 per cent while offending – as observed in spot checks by transport officials – has risen 14 per cent since 2009			0
@entity129 of the @entity130 said : ‘ basically we need more cops in cars to target the mobile phone abusers that we observe behind the wheel on most journeys			1
‘ most drivers would welcome harsher penalties but we still need the perceived risk of being caught to increase before more drivers hang up behind the wheel			0
’ the row threatens to overshadow the introduction today of ‘ drug driving ’ laws			1
drivers face prosecution if they are caught exceeding new limits which have , for the first time , been laid down for eight illegal drugs and eight prescription drugs			0
the levels for the illegal drugs , which include heroin , cocaine and cannabis , virtually mean there will be zero tolerance for drivers caught with these substances in their system			0
police will be able to use ‘ drugalysers ’ to screen for cannabis and cocaine at the roadside			0
officers will also be able to test for these and other drugs including ecstasy , lsd , ketamine and heroin at a police station , even if a driver passes the roadside check			0
under the existing law it is illegal to use a phone while driving , even when stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic			1
if caught , a driver faces an automatic fixed penalty notice worth £ 100 and 3 penalty points on their licence			0
only if it goes to court do they risk being disqualified , but the maximum fine is only £ 1,000			0
by comparison , drink - drivers face 6 months in jail , a fine of up to £ 5,000 fine and a driving ban for at least a year , rising to three years if convicted twice in a decade			2
the research revealed that using a handheld device is more distracting than alcohol or drugs , with drivers twice as likely to have their head down and eyes off the road while texting or using the internet			0
some 1.6 per cent of @entity7 's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009			2
two thirds of those observed breaking the law ( 1.1 per cent ) last year had the phone in their hand rather than held to their ear – suggesting that they were using it to text or check the internet			2
the figures prompted mr @entity215 to call for tougher penalties			1
speaking on his @entity218 phone - in , he said : ' i just do n’t think we should beat about the bush here			2
it might seem like someone , “ oh i ’m going to make a quick call home saying i ’m doing to be late because i ’m stuck in traffic "			0
' it is really dangerous			0
you can not call and devote the same attention as you should to keep yourself safe and others whilst driving a vehicle			2
' that ’s why in this government we ’ve actually increased the penalty , we ’ve dramatically increased the penalties , just i think a couple of years ago			0
' i personally would be prepared to go further until we send out a clear and unambiguous message that this is dangerous and it should not be done			1

@entity0 calls for prison terms for using a phone while driving
smartphones mean it is ' effectively using a computer on your *lap* '
warns tougher sanctions would be *unpopular* with voters before election
@entity73 roads minister @entity72 denies claim election is to blame
but @entity256 @entity215 backs calls for new laws to send a ' clear message '
