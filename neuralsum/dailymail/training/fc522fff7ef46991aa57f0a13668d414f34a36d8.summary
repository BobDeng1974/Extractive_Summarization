by @entity0 after decades of male dominance , women are finally making in - roads as racing car drivers			2
this july , @entity5 will be the first woman to take part in a @entity7 for 22 years as she will test drive cars in her role as a development driver for @entity11			1
and now another female driver is making history as it has been announced that @entity15 born @entity14 has been selected as a driver for @entity19 's @entity18 motor racing team			1
driving force : @entity14 has been selected as a driver for @entity19 's @entity18 motor racing team fast female : the 33 - year - old said she 's looking forward to speeding through the streets @entity14 , 33 , from @entity26 , is the first female driver in the @entity18 , a new initiative from the @entity28 which was established in 2012			1
she said : ' for me this is a really exciting opportunity			1
the car is fantastic , it looks amazing and it will be very quick			0
' racing through the streets of the world 's leading cities will be an incredible experience and i think it 's a great chance to bring racing to the people			0
we will be driving in their cities on their streets			0
' the @entity18 cars look similar to their @entity45 cousins but the engine , power train and power supply are unique			1
driven : @entity14 is an experienced @entity49 racer new series : the @entity18 cars look similar to their @entity45 cousins but are electric @entity18 cars accelerate from 0 - 100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h			1
the fundamental difference is that these cars are powered by a battery and represent the cutting edge of electric vehicle technology			0
the research and development supporting the @entity18 has the potential to radically change transport systems around the world , particularly in urban areas , where air pollution caused by fossil fuels is a serious concern			2
serious about winning : @entity14 has raced in several developmental open - wheel series in @entity15 , including @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 cutting edge technology : @entity18 cars accelerate from 0 - 100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h @entity19 's team , based in @entity73 , are led by team principal @entity74 and are currently preparing for their first race in this new championship , which will begin in @entity77 on 13th september			1
' @entity18 will be a very exciting and demanding championship and i think it brings an interesting new dimension to the sport			1
this is as much about strategy as it is about driving fast - it 's playing chess at 220 km / h , said @entity74			0
ceo of @entity19 , @entity86 , said he was ' very excited ' about the championship and said @entity14 has been selected to drive as a a serious podium contender			1
he said : ' we are serious about racing and serious about winning			0
' @entity14 has been race car driving for years and is a seasoned competitor in the indycar series in the @entity94 she has raced in several developmental open - wheel series in @entity15 , including @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
in 2005 she was given @entity96 's ' @entity97 of @entity99 ' award - previous winners include @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
so could @entity104 's career in @entity18 lead to become a champion of @entity45 ? she has already been behind the wheel of an @entity11 car having test driven for the @entity110 team at @entity111 near @entity112 in 2005			1
another brit making history : @entity5 is a development driver for the @entity11 team and will take part in july 's @entity118 @entity117 one of the team : susie with her teammates @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 but as @entity5 has discovered , breaking into @entity45 driving is n't easy			1
many doubt whether women are physically capable of dealing with the g - forces encountered when @entity45 driving while former @entity15 racing driver sir @entity129 told the @entity130 in april that he does n't think women have the ' mental aptitude to race hard , wheel - to - wheel			2
' women like @entity120 and @entity14 inevitably have to deal with sexism in the male dominated sport			2
' i 've lost count of the amount of times i 've been asked , " do you have a lipstick holder in your car ? " , ' @entity120 told the @entity144 last week			0
she added : ' it 's got easier to deal with over time			0
there will always be comments no matter what you do			0
you 'll always have those that are for you and those that are against you ... it 's hard for their ( men 's ) egos to cope with a girl beating them			0
' but with more women taking to the track , men might have to start getting used to it .			0

@entity14 , 33 , from @entity26 , will drive for @entity19 's @entity18 team
previously taken part in @entity165 and test driven @entity45 vehicle
she said : ' this is a really exciting opportunity '
