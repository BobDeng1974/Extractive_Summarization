by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:25 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 06:07 est , 20 november 2013 a neglected 13 - year - old boy who raped a young girl for two years avoided a jail sentence when a court heard of his own troubled background a ten - year - old boy repeatedly raped and sexually abused a seven - year - old girl over two years after becoming addicted to hardcore pornography , a court has heard			1
the schoolboy would sit at his home computer for hours scouring the internet for extreme porn , the court was told			2
after looking at the vile images he would play out his sexual fantasies on the young girl – which later developed into attempted rape and rape			1
the court heard how he committed sex acts on the girl between the age of ten and 12 when she was aged only seven and eight			2
yesterday the boy , now 13 , escaped a custodial sentence after a judge heard how he had been physically and emotionally abused as a young child			2
the court was told the boy was brought up in a home that lacked any ‘ sexual boundaries ’ and may well have witnessed his mother having sex			1
his mother was also aware that he was spending hours a day looking at indecent images on the internet but did nothing to stop it , the court heard			0
the case comes just days after calls for more restrictions to online pornography following @entity46 and @entity47 ’s announcement they would block internet search results linked to images of child abuse			0
the @entity52 ’s fight to force the web industry to clean up the internet through its @entity56 campaign has led to concerted pressure on service providers , such as @entity59 and @entity60			0
now all 20million families in the @entity62 who have an internet connection will be forced to say whether they want access to online pornography			0
hundreds of thousands are already signing up to have it blocked			0
@entity68 was told the schoolboy began accessing hardcore images on a computer from the age of nine			1
referring to the victim , judge @entity73 told the boy : ‘ in fact what you were doing was using her to play out fantasies that you had been watching on the internet , images of extreme pornography			1
’ judge @entity73 said the boy had suffered an appalling early childhood and had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse			1
he said the boy ’s mother chose to ‘ ignore that you were accessing for hours a day images of a pornographic nature on the internet ’			2
the court was told there was clear evidence of very poor parenting on behalf of his mother , which bordered on deliberate neglect			2
the judge at @entity102 in @entity103 , pictured , described the case as ' extremely sad ' reports showed this neglect had gone on for around seven years , during which time he had also been abused by his mother ’s partner			1
and the court heard that the boy ’s home environment lacked any barriers to the adult world			0
the judge said : ‘ you may have witnessed your mother and her partner engaged in sexual activity			1
you were brought up in a home that lacked any sexual boundaries			2
’ the court heard the boy , who sat in court with social workers and employees of a children ’s development centre where he is now living , was left without support or guidance			0
@entity131 , defending , described the case as ‘ extremely sad ’			0
reports suggested the assaults and rapes were a way of satisfying the boy ’s emotional needs rather than for sexual gratification alone			2
judge @entity73 said the boy could have been detained in custody because the crimes were so serious but said he wanted him to be rehabilitated rather than harmed further			1
the boy , who admitted committing rape , attempted rape and sexual assault , was placed on a three - year youth rehabilitation order with supervision , as well as a residency order so that he remains at the specialist centre where he is living			1
the teenager , from @entity153 , @entity103 , was also ordered to register with the police as a sex offender			1
the court heard he was seeking therapy to overcome his addiction			0
the judge said work to counsel the young girl , who is also in care , was under way but that it may take years for her to understand that what happened to her was not normal			1
over the next few months all existing internet users will be contacted by their service providers asking whether they want access to online pornography			0
new customers who set up a broadband account or switch providers will have the filters automatically selected , while customers who do not accept or decline will have them activated by default			0
the filters will apply to all devices linked to a home @entity180 and across any public network , such as those that can be accessed from shops , where children are likely to be present			0
only adults will be able to change the settings .			0

the boy , from the @entity153 area , began abusing the girl when he was 10
@entity68 told sexual abuse of the girl lasted for about two years
