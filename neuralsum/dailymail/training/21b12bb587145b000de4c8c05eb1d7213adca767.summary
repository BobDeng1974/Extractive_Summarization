@entity1 boss @entity0 will not jeopardise @entity3 ’s efforts to recapture full fitness by rushing him back just to help his side reach @entity6			1
the @entity8 striker , who has not played for @entity1 since august 31 , cleared the final hurdle in his rehabilitation yesterday when he began full training at the club ’s @entity13 base and he will again today			2
with the second leg of the @entity18 semi-final at @entity19 looming , the temptation for @entity0 would be to unleash @entity3			1
@entity1 showed in their draw with @entity21 how much they need the striker and @entity23 could be vulnerable after being embarrassed by @entity24			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 is adamant the club will not rush @entity3 's injury return @entity3 is reportedly in contention to play against @entity28 for @entity1 next weekend @entity21 goalkeeper @entity29 ( left ) kept @entity1 at bay with a string on impressive stops @entity3 posted this image on to @entity34 to celebrate his return to first team training @entity1 are now unbeaten in their last eight games at @entity38 : this draw , though , was their sixth stalemate in that sequence			1
@entity0 will consult @entity3 and the club ’s medical staff over the next 24 hours and only then will he decide if the 25 - year - old has a role to play tomorrow , or if he is held back for saturday ’s clash with @entity28			1
‘ the other players have shown ( enough ) in this period , in the last seven weeks , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ he ( @entity3 ) wants to be involved in the big games			2
but we have to be realistic and careful			0
@entity23 is a very important game			0
if he feels right to be involved in some part , then we will maybe look at it			0
but it is a big risk			0
’ another of @entity1 ’s striking options , @entity58 , was left out of the squad against @entity21			1
@entity0 spent an hour talking with him at @entity13 last week and has explained what he needs to do to get back into his plans			1
‘ @entity58 still has a contribution to make — which i think he will do , ’ said @entity0 , whose side were repeatedly denied by @entity21 keeper @entity29			2
‘ i have to assess the players every single day when i watch them			0
that is how i pick the squad			0
’ @entity0 had no concerns about the way @entity1 played and was full of compliments for @entity21			1
former @entity1 striker @entity71 ( centre ) pictured in action for @entity21 on his return to @entity38 @entity21 manager @entity75 was full of praise for his side , who drew 0 - 0 against @entity1 at @entity38 @entity75 reserved praise for @entity79 , who played 90 minutes and almost won the game for @entity21 @entity75 ’s side had two excellent chances , both of which fell to @entity79			1
‘ we had a strike force of a combined age of 268 , ’ said @entity75 , who partnered @entity79 with @entity71			0
‘ we are asking them to keep going out there			0
‘ for @entity79 to go 90 minutes at this level was a fantastic achievement			0
i think we have a chance ( in the replay )			0
@entity1 will have the lion ’s share of possession and chances and we just have to stay in it			2

a *toothless* @entity1 drew 0 - 0 with @entity21 in the @entity99 at @entity38
but @entity0 is not going to rush striker @entity3 back
@entity3 is reportedly going to be considered to face @entity28 next week
