@entity0 made an honourable and defiant exit from the @entity2 on sunday as they took the holders to the wire and may have clinched a seismic upset , but for a glaring official oversight			1
@entity8 ’s side became the third of four @entity11 challengers to be dispatched from @entity13 ’s premier event over a punishing weekend , but this was no meek capitulation			0
despite the chronic inconvenience of losing @entity18 to a contentious ban and @entity20 to an untimely injury , the visitors raged gallantly against the dying of the light			2
@entity24 crosses for a late try for @entity26 as they put victory over @entity0 on sunday beyond doubt @entity29 rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin - binned @entity0 ' @entity31 attempts to bust through the wall - like defence of @entity34 champions @entity26 @entity26 : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity24 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48			1
replacements : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57			0
tries : @entity37 , @entity24			0
conversions : @entity40 ( 2 ) penalties : @entity40 ( 6 ) @entity0 : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity31 , @entity73 , @entity74			1
replacements : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity79 - @entity78 , @entity80 , @entity8 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83			2
tries : @entity62 ( 2 ) conversions : @entity82			2
penalties : @entity66 ( 2 ) referee : @entity88 ( @entity89 ) @entity26 are back - to - back continental champions , awash with @entity91 talent , but they were given a scare by their tenacious opponents — and even forced to adopt sly , illegal tactics to survive a second - half fightback			1
seven minutes from full - time amid a cacophony at @entity98 , @entity0 launched a daring raid from their own 22 which eventually culminated in a second try for @entity101 , but it also featured a miscarriage of justice			1
former @entity104 lock @entity24 pulled back @entity63 off the ball as he ran clear in support of @entity107			0
it was surely one of the most obvious offences of its type ever committed in the sport , yet @entity24 not only avoided a yellow card , but he was on hand to touch down three minutes from time for the try which distorted the final scoreline			2
wasps were left battered and beaten , but richly deserving of the ovations from their pockets of supporters around the ground			0
captain @entity73 ’s work - load was worthy of three men and @entity64 also gave body and soul to the cause , while @entity67 and @entity63 were outstanding			0
@entity26 playmaker @entity40 pulls the strings for the defending @entity34 champions @entity0 ' no 10 @entity66 kicks away from @entity40 during their @entity130 quarter - final @entity26 fans celebrate after the opening try from their giant @entity134 centre @entity37 @entity136 v saracens , @entity137 , @entity138 , saturday , april 18 , 3.15pm ( gmt ) @entity26 v @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , sunday , april 19 , 3.15pm ( gmt ) there was a certain sense of inevitability about the outcome , but @entity0 refused to accept that they were out - gunned , even when @entity26 were able to summon the likes of @entity55 and @entity147 from their stellar cast of reserves			1
@entity8 was delighted with how his side had performed , once they stopped being so deferential			0
‘ i ’m really proud of the effort and the commitment , ’ he said			0
‘ there was real frustration in the first half , because we gave them a bit too much respect in the first 30 minutes			0
we were a little bit frantic , a little bit panicky , but we will learn from that and i thought we played some really good stuff on occasions			0
i ’m pleased that we were in it right to the end			0
’ @entity0 defence descend on @entity26 's @entity43 at the @entity166 on sunday @entity26 speedster @entity167 makes a break for the defending champions @entity66 makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the @entity26 player on the ground asked about @entity24 ’ illegal tug on @entity63 ’s shirt , @entity8 added : ‘ there were three people ( in the ground ) who did n’t see it … the referee and the two touch judges			1
’ @entity26 went ahead when @entity37 blasted over the line from close range in the eighth minute and , as their pack took control , @entity40 was able to dispatch five first - half penalties			1
the @entity188 leaders went into the break 22 - 6 up , but @entity0 turned the tables as @entity63 scorched down the right to tee up @entity62 ’s first try			1
@entity40 ’s sixth penalty appeared to settle the holders , but @entity62 touched down for the second time after another crucial intervention by the outstanding @entity63			2
when @entity24 went over to quell the uprising moments later , it secured @entity26 a semi-final against @entity139 in @entity141 , and left @entity0 to head home craving another shot at this tournament next season .			1
