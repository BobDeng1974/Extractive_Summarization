by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 19 february 2014 updated : 10:00 est , 20 february 2014 fizz for a fiver ? chefs @entity3 and @entity5 say a decent bubbly can be yours for exactly this price — thanks to the 1970s drinks gadget @entity11			1
they swear it can turn an average plonk into a drink tasting exactly like champagne			1
@entity5 explains : ‘ if you put an ok bottle of wine in the @entity11 , it will bubble up to be much better than an ok champagne			1
’ and in a blind test , @entity3 fooled members of the public into thinking they were drinking champagne after putting a £ 5.25 bottle of @entity27 through the gadget			1
the method is simple — decant the wine into the bottle , pop it in the machine , then press the button to add carbon dioxide			1
but does it work ? we asked @entity38 wine expert and author of @entity40 , @entity41 , to test it out on white and rose supermarket wines			1
@entity41 tries out using a @entity11 to make alternative champagne there were so many bubbles it looked like @entity48 at first			1
but they soon calmed down and lasted a good hour in the bottle			1
the fizz really enhanced the fresh apple and pear aromas ! you could easily pass this off as a dry £ 10 @entity56			1
score : 8/10 this is fantastic			2
it has more flavour and weight than the @entity62 , and the result is more interesting			0
golden in the glass , the bubbles bring out the apple flavours			0
it reminds me of sparkling @entity70 from the @entity71 , which cost at least £ 12			0
score : 8/10 this simple , dry rose is super sippable as it is , so i did wonder if bubbles would make it any better			0
the answer was , not really			0
the bubbles diluted the delicate strawberry flavours			0
score : 5/10 fan of the fizz : @entity83 believes you can make your own bubbly at home for much less than buying it in the shops a smart , refreshing wine , made from @entity90 and grown in @entity91 ’s @entity71			1
adding bubbles really intensifies the aroma and i loved the lemony aftertaste			0
it could pass for a smart @entity91 fizz			1
score : 7/10 as this is a @entity101 — one of the main grapes used in champagne — you ’d think it would work with bubbles			1
but the wine lost its personality , which it has in spades without bubbles — golden in the glass , with ripe lemon flavours			2
score : 4/10 this @entity115 wine is a juicy beast loaded with red fruit flavours			2
add bubbles and you have a rose that tastes divine			0
the colour is precious - stone pink and with bubbles looks even more appealing			2
this could easily pass for a £ 10 bubbly			2
score : 10/10 not even a blast of gas could perk this up			0
in fact , there ’s a medicinal taste and the big bubbles do n’t make it go down any easier			0
do n’t waste your gas			0
in fact , do n’t waste your money in the first place			0
score : 1/10 i ’m strangely fond of this			0
get past the blue bottle and inside is a lovely light white with a touch of sweetness			2
it already has a slight spritz , so does it need another blast of bubbles ? @entity3 may disagree but i prefer it unadulterated			1
score : 5/10 bottle your own bubbly : chef @entity3 fooled members of the public into thinking they were drinking champagne after putting a £ 5.25 bottle of @entity27 through a @entity158 this really does what it says on the label			1
it ’s a crisp , floral wine and so works well with the bubbles — it has instant aromatic appeal			2
the flavours are crisper than @entity56 , but it ’s refreshingly good			0
score : 9/10 this @entity115 rose is bright and juicy , and the colour is to die for			0
sweetheart pink , with strawberry and raspberry flavours , the bubbles create a taste explosion ! the colour is more intense than many pink @entity178			0
turn the lights down and your guests will never know			0
score : 9/10 as a long - time champagne lover , i thought it was impossible to produce anything nearly as good			1
this ca n’t give you instant champagne			2
but it will make cheap wine bubbilicious			1
overall , the single grapes worked best			0
the only thing missing in most cases was the pop of a cork ! @entity11 £ 49.99 - 149.99 , sodastream.co.uk			1

chef @entity5 says carbonating cheap wine makes decent fizz
claims average wine is better than an ' ok champagne ' when made bubbly
@entity3 agrees - and both use @entity11 to fizz up the plonk
@entity3 fooled testers into thinking they were drinking champagne using bottle of fizzed - up @entity27
