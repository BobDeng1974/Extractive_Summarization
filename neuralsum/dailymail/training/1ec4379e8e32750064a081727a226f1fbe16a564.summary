in the video @entity10 , thought to be from @entity12 , can been seen stamping around on a frozen puddle			2
flailing her arms , she expertly manages to stay upright but when she bends down for a closer look everything goes horribly wrong			1
as she lays her hand on the ice she accidentally over-balances , tipping forward as her feet slide out from under her			0
however curiosity gets the better of her and she bends down to get a closer look at the ice having saved herself earlier the girl 's feet suddenly slide out from under her and she ends up face down she ends up bent over double with her head meeting the ice with a soft crunch			1
