by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 11:50 est , 8 august 2012 fighting in @entity1 has spread to new areas , activists have claimed , as rebels try to expand their hold inside @entity7 's largest city			1
despite intense bombardment from government air power and artillery , @entity1 's insurgents have now withstood two weeks of counterattacks by president @entity14 's troops and are clawing toward the city centre			1
local activist @entity16 says fierce clashes are going on in @entity18 and @entity20 districts , while the @entity22 - based @entity21 also says fighting has extended to new parts of the city			2
officials from @entity43 , an ally of the @entity7 government , are also racheting up the international pressure after 48 @entity43 were seized by rebels just outside @entity44 on saturday			1
president @entity14 made a rare appearance on @entity7 television with @entity43 's security chief , @entity41 , who is a senior aide to @entity64 ayatollah @entity63 , as @entity41 continued efforts to free his countrymen			1
ahead of a international meeting on @entity7 planned by @entity68 for thursday , mr @entity41 said only a ' @entity7 solution ' would end the crisis in the country			2
he added that @entity7 is part of an ' axis of resistance ' which his government would never allow to be broken			1
a @entity35 fighter screams in pain after he was injured in a leg by shrapnel from a shell fired from a @entity7 army tank in the @entity83 neighbourhood of central @entity1 today another man comes forward to give the fighter first - aid treatment on his injured limb the man 's leg is bandaged , trickles of his blood can be seen across the floor near him the same fighter is pictured in an ambulance now , as his comrades take him away from the battlezone @entity1 is @entity7 's commercial hub and lies close to the @entity99 border , where rebels have their rear bases			1
if the opposition were to gain control of the city it would be a major blow to the regime			2
it has been the scene of fierce fighting for over a fortnight , with clashes said to be much longer and crueller than the skirmishes that took place in the capital @entity44 before opposition was put down there			0
if @entity14 loses the city , it is likely to become the seat of any provisional government set up in opposition to his regime , turning it into a kind of @entity7 @entity125 , analysts have said			1
international recognition will surely follow - most probably led by the neighbouring @entity128 monarchies , longtime opponents of @entity14 - making the position of the incumbent regime increasingly untenable			0
a @entity7 rebel fighter runs through the battle - scarred streets of @entity83 during clashes with the army the move in fighting to central @entity1 has diminished the effectiveness of the regime 's armoured units with airpower and armoured units neutralised , the @entity7 military faces deploying infantry units to fight fierce hand - to - hand clashes with rebels to clear a @entity35 fighter fires his gun during clashes with @entity7 army			1
the ranks of the rebels have been swelled by battle - hardened veterans from insurgencies in @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity155 's @entity154 chaos : a @entity7 man shouts at the scene of a bombed building in @entity1 purportedly hit during shelling which was targeting the @entity35 command centre but hit a residential neighborhood located behind destruction : @entity1 has been the scene of an intense bombardment during two weeks of fighting between insurgents and soldiers from teh @entity7 military indications are that the fighting in @entity1 will not subside as quickly as in @entity44			1
rebels hold the territory between @entity1 and the @entity99 border and it has been claimed that mobile anti-aircraft missiles are being shipped in from @entity99 which would quickly curtail the regime 's dominance in the skies			1
@entity22 is to give an extra £ 10million of funding to help more than 45,000 refugees fleeing the conflict in @entity7			0
international development secretary @entity182 made the pledge as he visited the @entity185 tented refugee camp in @entity186 , on the @entity7 border			0
the money represents a four fold increase in @entity22 aid for refugees which was previously £ 3million			0
mr @entity182 said : ' in the midst of its sporting triumphs at the @entity195 , @entity22 has not forgotten the people of @entity7			0
today 's extra support shows we stand alongside those who have lost everything because of the actions of this ruthless regime			0
' the stories i 've heard today paint a horrifying picture of everyday life for hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in @entity7			0
i 've met people left with only the clothes on their backs			0
i 've spoken to families forced to flee their homes in the dead of night , some walking miles under the constant threat of violence and death if caught trying to escape			0
" it will provide emergency food rations for more than 18,000 @entity7 refugees , plus safe drinking water and sanitation amid the hot conditions , including for mothers and children caught up in violence			0
@entity227 will go to three humanitarian bodies providing assistance in the region , the @entity231 , @entity232 , and @entity233			0
approximately £ 5.5 million of the additional funding will be used for activities in @entity186 and the remainder in @entity7 's other neighbouring countries , @entity51 , @entity99 and @entity238			1
now clashes have spread to the city 's old town , where crooked , narrow streets are difficult for even cars to negotiate , the effectiveness of the military 's armoured divisions has also been damaged			1
' moving tanks and armored vehicles to that part of @entity1 would be sheer suicide , because they will make an easy target for the insurgents , who now have anti-tank weapons , ' said @entity255 in an analysis piece for @entity258 newspaper @entity257			1
fighting has also now apparently broken out in @entity1 's @entity261 districts , which had hitherto remained fiercely neutral , with at least part of that community said to have taken sides with the rebels			1
with airpower and armoured units neutralised , the @entity7 military faces deploying infantry units to fight fierce hand - to - hand clashes with rebels to clear @entity1			1
however , with rebel units packed with veterans of insurgencies in @entity153 , @entity152 and @entity155 's @entity154 , this is exactly the kind of warfare that the rebels want to fight			2
well armed and battle hardened , they outclass the regular army in close combat			0
the @entity7 regime has suffered a series of setbacks over the past month that point to a loosening of its grip on the country			2
yesterday @entity14 's prime minister @entity289 became the highest - ranking government official yet to defect after he fled across the border to @entity186			0
although @entity14 has been hit by a string of embarrassing defections of military and political figures , they have yet to cause visible changes in the regime 's abilities on the battlefield			2
the loss of high - profile government officials , however , suggests fissures are reaching deeper into the ruling system and could force @entity14 to retreat further behind a cadre of loyalists			0
@entity289 and an entourage of family members were expected to head next to the @entity128 state of @entity309 , a key backer of the @entity7 rebels , in a further sign of the regional brinksmanship and gambits over @entity14 's fate			1
the @entity128 monarchies and @entity99 have strongly backed the rebel forces while @entity14 has counted on support from traditional allies such as @entity43 , @entity155 and @entity320			1
setback : @entity7 's new prime minister @entity289 , left , defected to @entity186 yesterday , in the latest blow to the faltering regime of president @entity14 , right @entity289 's defection is a humiliating blow for @entity14 after a string of generals and ambassadors has peeled away			1
like nearly all prominent defectors so far , @entity289 is a member of @entity7 's majority @entity332 - the @entity335 sect which forms the bedrock of the more than 17 - month uprising			2
his break suggests that elements of the @entity332 elite - long a pillar of @entity14 's rule - could be growing uneasy with the relentless bloodshed and the hardline policies of @entity14 's minority @entity346 community , which dominates the regime 's inner circle			0
the @entity346 sect is an offshoot of @entity352			0
just hours before word of the defection got out , @entity14 suffered another blow in his attempt to portray he is in control : a bomb ripped through the third floor of the state tv building in @entity44 , wounding at least three employees and displaying the ability of rebels to strike in the heart of the capital			0
but power remains closely held within @entity14 's inner circle and even posts such as the prime minister have limited clout			0
@entity289 's departure will not immediately undercut the regime 's ability to fight rebels			2
suffering : a man evacuates an elderly woman from her house during clashes between rebel fighters and @entity7 government forces in the @entity382 district of @entity1 deaths : men pull the body of a boy from the rubble of his family house after it was destroyed in the fierce fighting which has spread throughout the city injuries : men evacuate a wounded youth during clashes between rebel fighters and @entity7 government forces in the @entity382 district @entity7 's rebels have grown increasingly bold and capable in recent months			1
in july , the rebels and @entity7 regime forces fought intense battles for a week in @entity44 in what was the opposition fighters ' biggest challenge so far in the capital			1
in a brazen daylight attack , rebels commandeered a bus and snatched 48 @entity43 just outside @entity44 on saturday			2
@entity43 said those abducted were pilgrims who were visiting a shrine about 10 miles south of @entity44 and were on their way to the airport to return home			0
but the captors claimed in a video broadcast sunday that one of the captives was an officer of @entity43 's powerful revolutionary guards and that the 48 were on a ' reconnaissance mission ' for @entity14 's close allies in @entity68			2
@entity7 has been the scene of unrest since march 2011			0
@entity44 blames ' outlaws , saboteurs , and armed terrorist groups ' for the violence , claiming that it is being orchestrated from abroad			0

if the city falls to rebels it could become seat of new provisional government
mobile missile batteries said to be on the way to @entity1 from @entity99
fighting in city 's centre could neutralise regime military 's armoured units
@entity43 security chief describes @entity7 as part of an ' axis of resistance '
