the @entity0 are described as one of the 8th wonders of the world , but the life - size figures created over 2,200 years ago , were inspired by artwork by the ancient @entity6 , one expert claims			1
@entity8 believes it is ‘ likely ’ the 8,000 giant sculptures , which were buried in pits close to the mausoleum of @entity13 , were the result of contact between @entity6 and @entity16			1
he cites newly translated ancient records that tell of giant statues appearing in the @entity19 , which inspired @entity13 , as evidence that the warriors of the @entity13 were based on 12 earlier life - size statues			1
@entity8 believes it is ' likely ' the 8,000 giant sculptures of @entity0 ( pictured ) , which were buried in pits close to the mausoleum of @entity13 , were the result of contact between @entity6 and @entity16 the @entity0 is a form of funerary art buried with the @entity13 in 210 to 209 @entity27 and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife			1
arguably the most famous archaeological site in the world , it was discovered by chance by villagers in 1974 , and excavation has been on - going at the site since that date			0
an extraordinary feat of mass - production , each figure was given an individual personality although they were not intended to be portraits			0
the figures vary in height according to their roles , with the tallest being the generals			0
current estimates are that there were over 8,000 soldiers , 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses , the majority of which are still buried			0
since 1998 , figures of terracotta acrobats , bureaucrats , musicians and bronze birds have been discovered on site			0
they were designed to entertain the @entity13 in his afterlife they are of crucial importance to our understanding of his attempts to control the world even in death			0
‘ it is perfectly possible and actually likely that the sculptures of the @entity13 are the result of early contact between @entity6 and @entity16 , ’ dr @entity8 , a reader at the @entity72 , @entity73 , told @entity74			1
before the time of the @entity13 , there were no life - size figurines created in @entity16 and he thinks the idea came from @entity84 ’s campaigns			1
the records , which dr @entity8 translated , reveal the statues were around 38ft tall ( 11.5m ) and impressed the emperor who built duplicates of them in bronze			2
the bronzes no longer exist as they were destroyed after the death of the @entity13			0
however , a number of writers of the time documented the statues ' existence , dr @entity8 wrote in the journal @entity73			2
' it is perfectly possible and actually likely that the sculptures of the @entity13 are the result of early contact between @entity6 and @entity16 , ' dr @entity8 said			1
a carved marble relief of wrestlers is pictured before the time of the @entity13 , there were no life sized figurines created in @entity16 records suggest there were links between @entity16 and @entity6 and that sculptors were influenced by @entity6 culture			1
dr @entity8 believes statues of semi naked acrobats and dancers , which were found in another pit close to the mausoleum , are so realistic as sculptors learned from @entity6 masters , who collectively took centuries to perfect such realism in their sculptures and etchings			2
he wrote : ' the [ @entity16 ] sculptors attempted to render a bone structure , muscles and sinews to depict a person in movement			0
‘ this comes close to an understanding of the human body that was employed at the time only in @entity130 ( @entity6 influenced ) @entity131 and @entity132			2
’ however , while dr @entity8 believes he might have solved the inspiration behind the @entity0 , it remains a mystery why rulers of the @entity137 stopped making large sculptures and instead swapped to miniatures			2
he suggests that the craftsmen who mastered how to build the huge figurines might have died without passing their skills on to the next generation , or that it was thought to be unlucky to replicate foreign models .			0
