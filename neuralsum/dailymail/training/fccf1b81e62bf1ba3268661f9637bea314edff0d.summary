an asteroid the size of a bus came to within 186,000 miles of @entity3 - a close shave in cosmic terms - on saturday morning			1
the recently - detected asteroid @entity6 was closer to @entity3 than the @entity8 - which is on average 238,855 miles away from our planet - on its closest approach at 4.13am			1
the asteroid is about 7.6 metres wide , according to @entity15 's @entity14 project based at the agency 's @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity19			2
looming : this @entity15 video shows @entity6 on its approach to @entity3			1
the bus - sized asteroid came closer to @entity3 than our own moon hair 's breadth : the asteroid closes in on @entity3 , eventually passing by to within just 186,000 miles of us an asteroid of that size would cause significant damage if it impacted a major city , potentially hitting with the impact of a nuclear bomb roughly half the size of the one that hit @entity39 in 1945			1
the asteroid was discovered on wednesday , april 28 , by astronomers with the @entity43 team , according to an alert by the @entity45 , an arm of the @entity47 that chronicles asteroid discoveries , reports @entity49			2
@entity15 scientists and researchers around the world constantly monitor the sky for asteroids that could hit the surface of the planet			1
startling new research has revealed just how vulnerable our planet is to asteroid impacts			1
a trio of former astronauts has announced we ’re up to ten times more likely to be hit than previously thought - and warn the only way we ’ve avoided disaster so far is through ' blind luck '			2
@entity67 reminder : a meteorite contrail is seen over @entity69 in @entity70 in february			0
it caused sharp explosions and reportedly injured around 100 people , including many hurt by broken glass			0
however , the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere , or in unpopulated areas including the @entity81 and @entity80			0
despite the majority of impacts occurring in water and high up in the atmosphere , a number have taken place on land			0
the @entity69 meteorite flew above the @entity70 city in 2013			2
the impact injured hundreds of people and served as a reminder of how deadly incoming space rocks can be			0
asteroids hitting the @entity3 caused 26 nuclear - scale explosions between 2000 and 2013 , a new report has revealed			1
some were more powerful , and in one case , dozens of times stronger , than the 15 - kiloton atom bomb blast that destroyed @entity39			0
despite the majority of impacts occurring in water and high up in the atmosphere , a number have taken place on land			0
pictured , an illustration of an asteroid on its way to @entity3 three former astronauts supporting the @entity112 - a private company devoted to protecting @entity3 from asteroids - presented the data			1
the impacts were recorded by the @entity116 which operates a global network of sensors listening out for nuclear weapon detonations			0
most occurred too high in the atmosphere to cause any serious damage on the ground			0
but the evidence is a sobering reminder of how vulnerable the @entity3 is to the threat from space , say scientists			1
the most dramatic impact by an asteroid or comet in recent times occurred when an object exploded over @entity133 , @entity134 , in 1908 with an energy yield equivalent to between 5,000 and 15,000 tons of @entity136			2
an area of forest covering 770 square miles ( 2,000 square km ) was flattened by the blast			0
the horrifying prospect of an asteroid hitting the @entity3 was the subject of the hit movies @entity144 , starring @entity145 , and @entity146 , starring @entity147 .			1

@entity6 came to within just 186,000 miles of @entity3
by *comparison* , the @entity8 is on average 238,855 miles away from the planet
had it hit , the asteroid could have levelled a small city
