it may sound like something from a science fiction film , but scientists say they have created ' zombie cells ' - that continue to work after they are dead			2
but unlike the walking dead of @entity7 , these cells actually perform some functions better than when they were alive			0
scientists say by coating organic cells in silicic acid they are able to withstand far greater temperatures and pressures than flesh			1
the cells are coated in silicic acid and it ' embalms ' the living cell and can survive greater temperatures than flesh the technique means scientists can preserve valuable biological material by ' converting it into a fossil			1
' the process was developed by researchers from @entity29 in @entity30 and the @entity31			1
scientists used silicic acid to ' embalm ' the mammalian cells and create a near - perfect replica of its structure			2
they believe the zombie cells could be used in commercial manufacturing , including fuel cells or sensor technology and may be the future of nanotechnology			1
' it 's very challenging for researchers to build structures at a nanometer scale			0
we can make particles and wires , but @entity53 arbitrary structures have n't been achieved yet , ' lead researcher @entity48 was quoted as saying in the @entity54			0
he added : ' with this technique , we do n't need to build those structures - nature does it for us			0
' the process was developed by researchers from @entity29 and @entity31 silica has been known for its hard properties since ancient times and is found in sand and quartz			1
the living cells are painted with the acid in a petri dish and the silica solution then forms a replica down to the most minute detail			1
by being able to survive extreme pressures and temperatures , the zombie cells can ' perform some functions better than when they were alive ' , says @entity76 at the @entity78 @entity77			2
he said by heating the silica to @entity82 , the organic part of the cell is evaporated and the solution is kept as a ' three - dimensional @entity85 wax replica of a formerly living being			2
' mr @entity48 said the process means the cells can carry on ' working ' even after they are dead			0
he said : ' @entity88 was mummified to approximately resemble his living self , but the process took place without mineralisation [ a process of fossilisation ]			0
' our zombie cells bridge chemistry and biology to create forms that not only near - perfectly resemble their past selves , but can do future work			0

scientists ' embalm ' the living cell in a silica acid solution
fossilised cell can survive greater temperatures and pressures than flesh
researchers from @entity29 and @entity31 hope technique can used in commercial manufacturing
