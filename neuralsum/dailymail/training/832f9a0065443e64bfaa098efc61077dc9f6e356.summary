confident : @entity0 's made it in @entity2 and she is happy in her life at the moment owning huge , over-excitable labrador puppies was all it took to teach @entity7 how to control the men in her life			1
training both requires the same skills says @entity11 , the @entity13 actress who captivated @entity2 in films such as @entity15			1
forget over-analysing , says the @entity18 - nominated star , who insists it is the trait in women men find most difficult to deal with			1
the solution is much more simple			1
‘ the best training i ever received in my understanding of boys – and of grown men , too – was having labradors , ’ she says			1
‘ dogs need three things			1
they need to run a lot , to be fed a lot , to be loved and taken care of a lot – and that ’s it			2
if you can cover those three bases , you ’re good to go			2
‘ we women tend to forget that and try to over-complicate relationships with men , which we should never do because they are very simple creatures – not simple as in stupid , but simple in the best way , meaning straightforward and pragmatic			1
‘ boys are simple and lovely and uncomplicated , and we women do best when we remember that			2
’ it ’s fair to say @entity11 knows what she is talking about , even though it has been a lesson learned a little late in life			2
happily single at the moment , she has dated a host of stars and her background is littered with broken relationships			1
@entity61 once famously ditched her ‘ live ’ on the @entity63 tv show , and her love affair with @entity65 , to whom she was engaged , ended in acrimony when his stepmother , @entity67 , commandeered the couple ’s wedding plans			1
these days the only men in @entity11 ’s life are her son @entity72 , five , and his father , tv producer @entity74			2
although she and @entity75 are no longer romantically involved , they live close to each other near @entity77 in @entity2 , and @entity72 divides his time between them			2
and while some women long for a daughter to play dolls and dress up with , @entity0 says she can think of little worse			2
‘ i ’m so grateful i do n’t have a girl because when i was young i put my parents through hell			2
i was conniving , manipulative , emotionally challenged – you name it			2
’ but for all that , she is proud of how her parents brought her up and is determined to ensure @entity72 grows with the same values and manners her mother instilled in the young driver			0
table manners , she says , were drilled into her as a child			0
happily single at the moment , she has dated a host of stars , including @entity61 who ditched her on @entity63 her understanding of men was partly informed by her love affair with @entity65 , to whom she was engaged			1
it ended in acrimony when his stepmother , @entity67 , commandeered their wedding plans that is why she is equally insistent @entity72 never misbehaves at the table			0
‘ i think we @entity108 eat more politely than @entity110 , so i insist that he eats nicely , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’m generally a very relaxed parent in that he can wear what he wants and he knows that he ’s entitled to his own opinion about lots of things			0
‘ but i am a stickler for good manners when he ’s around food			0
his @entity110 friends have a burger in hand , they ’re dropping ketchup all over the furniture , eating with their mouths open , sometimes standing on a chair , and i do n’t put up with that with @entity72			0
’ as a result , she says , people are starting to notice his excellent table manners			0
‘ boys are simple and lovely and uncomplicated , and we women do best when we remember that ’ ‘ my friends ’ kids are sent to my house to learn how to eat ! their parents say , “ can you make my kid have good manners like @entity72 ? ” i say , “ sure , send them round here to dinner			0
” ' i think @entity13 parents have to be stricter than @entity147 about things like this because when you ’re living inside so much as we do in @entity13 you have to learn to behave			1
‘ you do n’t have as much space , you ca n’t let the kids go and work all their energy out outside and when you sit down to eat you ’re inside the house , not in the garden			0
‘ so i suppose we have the rain to thank for our good manners ! ’ now 44 , @entity11 is fast approaching the dangerous age when actresses begin to count their wrinkles and bemoan their sagging bodies			1
not that @entity11 has much to worry about on that score			0
just last year she was pictured in the @entity165 looking lean and toned in a tiny bikini			1
relaxing : @entity0 received an onslaught of criticism about her body when this image emerged of her in the @entity165 body confident : she responded by posing naked for @entity172 , adding she is healthy and happy and when @entity174 trolls posted unpleasant comments about her fabulous figure , driver retaliated by posting a nude photograph of herself			1
‘ i was surprised by that bullying – it came out of nowhere and i thought it was weird , ’ she says			0
‘ but if you ’re going to start bullying people who are confident and ok with themselves , then those comments reflect more on the crazies sitting behind their computers doing that stuff , than on me			1
‘ i have a very good body image , and always have had			1
’ and neither is she afraid to allow her body to suffer for her art. for her first film , @entity190 , she happily piled on 2st			1
‘ i have always felt good about the shape i am in			0
i ’m very healthy – a lot healthier than a lot of younger actresses that i come across these days who seem to feel a huge lot of pressure to stay very slim indeed			0
’ driver is currently starring in @entity199 , a @entity110 tv series based on @entity202 ’s novel			0
‘ these days , i ’m just happy to be still working and i ’m grateful that i ’m still here and i ’m healthy and that i ’m not crazy			0
‘ and that means i ’ve sort of survived			0
i ’m not without scars , but i ’ve survived			0
