they say two heads are better than one - but this horse seems to be taking the phrase quite literally ! photographer @entity4 , 57 , was stunned when he checked out a snap he 'd taken of a wild pony - but discovered it appeared to have grown a second head			2
bird watcher @entity4 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , had taken out his camera to capture rare birds on film			2
optical illusion : photographer @entity4 managed to snap what appeared to be a two - headed horse on a hill overlooking three cliffs bay on the @entity19 but after an unsuccessful day 's twitching with a friend , @entity4 turned his attentions to the ponies nearby			1
and more through luck than any design , he managed to capture he exact moment when one of the ponies turned , creating the striking optical illusion of a horse with two heads			1
it was not until @entity4 looked at his camera 's display that he realised how his split - second timing had caught the amazing image			2
he said : ' a friend had bought a two - man folding chair hide and he asked if i wanted to test it out with him , in an area of gorse up on the hill called ' @entity42 ' overlooking the beautiful @entity43 on the @entity19			0
beauty spot : @entity4 was birdwatching on a hill overlooking the stunning three cliffs bay in @entity19 near @entity47 when he photographed the ' two - headed horse ' ' i got up at 5am and we sat for hours waiting for some birds but only one landed all morning			1
' we noticed some wild ponies in the distance so i put my 1.7x converter on my @entity55 and 200 - 400mm lens and took some shots			0
' i saw one pony coming out from behind a bush so i waited and when it turned its head to look at us , i instinctively pressed the shutter button			0
' when i then looked at it on my camera 's lcd screen to check exposure , i noticed that there were in fact two horses @entity68			0
' i think my photo of a two - headed horse turned out to be better than any i could have taken of birds ! ' the optical illusion is created when the distance between the two horses is foreshortened by the telephoto lens used by @entity4			1
over long distances , this effect causes the two subjects to appear much much closer than they really are .			0
