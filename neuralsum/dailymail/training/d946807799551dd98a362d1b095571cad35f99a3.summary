by @entity0 published : 10:03 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 16 september 2013 a criminal convicted of harassment and theft was allowed to freely roam a court building for more than an hour after being jailed - because there were no prison cells in which to hold him			1
@entity8 , 19 , boasted that he could have easily ‘ done a runner ’ when magistrates politely asked him to wait at the back of @entity11 ’ court after they handed him a 16 - week jail term			1
@entity8 was locked up last thursday for breaching the community order part of his suspended prison sentence - but was told could not be taken to jail straight away because the cells were shut that day			1
convicted criminal : @entity8 , 19 , boasted that he could have easily ' done a runner ' when magistrates politely asked him to wait at the back of a court after they handed him a 16 - week jail term the building was short of security staff , so @entity8 - who had previously skipped bail - was instead told to wait at the back of the courtroom			1
but he loitered outside with other members of the public			2
he also ate chocolate from a vending machine , smoked in the toilets , phoned his work to say he was going to be ‘ off for a while ’ , chatted to friends and arranged for clothes to be brought to him in jail			1
eventually a security van arrived from 36 miles away in @entity41 - one hour and five minutes later - to drive @entity8 a further 70 miles to @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
speaking after his sentencing , @entity8 laughed how he could have walked free from court and would have done if he had been given a longer sentence			1
he even joked about being a ‘ free man ’			2
@entity8 said : ‘ last year , when i did a runner they could n’t catch me for four months - and now they ’re putting all this trust in me			1
i have been able to call five or six people			2
cells closed : the @entity56 building was short of security staff , so @entity8 - who had previously skipped bail - was instead told to wait at the back of the courtroom ‘ i have just sorted out someone to bring me my clothes			1
i have n’t got any cuffs on me			2
i ’m still a free man			2
normally , i would be in a cell now , waiting , but i have time to sort things out			0
delay : @entity8 ate chocolate from a vending machine , smoked in the toilets , and phoned his work to say he was going to be ' off for a while ' ‘ i even rang up work and said i would n’t be in			1
it ’s inhumane treatment - tempting me to do a runner and with all the things i have got going for me in my life at the moment			1
‘ if i had been given a longer sentence i ’d be gone by now			0
at the moment , i will be out before @entity79 , and if i ran away i would just be sent down for longer - but it ’s only two months			2
‘ i might as well just do it			0
if it was a longer stretch there would be no chance i ’d be waiting here			0
’ the court heard @entity8 had breached an original order , which was put in place for harassment , theft and failing to surrender to bail , which included completing 100 hours of unpaid work			1
he had only completed 25 hours			0
but he was told by magistrates that because the cells were closed on tuesdays and thursdays and the court were short - staffed , he would have to wait to be taken away			1
chairman of the magistrates @entity97 said : ‘ you have a persistent disregard for court orders and we feel it would not be unjust to activate the custodial sentence			0
wait at the back of court until the security staff arrive			1
' you are in lawful custody and must remain in the court			0
we are short of security staff			0
that is why you have not been taken down immediately			0
’ after the hearing even @entity8 ’s solicitor , @entity112 , admitted the decision did ‘ not make any sense ’ , saying : ‘ there is a risk of people walking out the door			1
‘ it is a hell of a temptation when you ’ve just been given a prison sentence			0
i ca n’t see the sense of it			0
' there is a concern that some people will do a runner			2
it seems this has just been imposed on the court without anyone thinking it through			0
’ ' it is just a matter of time before someone does a runner			2
it is an absolute joke ' @entity141 , local solicitor local solicitor @entity141 also branded the ruling ‘ a farce ’ and said new regulations mean @entity11 criminals are now held in custody at neighbouring courts in @entity147 and @entity148			0
however , @entity8 was not transferred to these courts or @entity151 over the road , where the majority of security staff were based that day			1
mr @entity141 said : ‘ it ’s a farce			0
this has only just come into play around two weeks ago			0
‘ what has happened is the cells are closed at @entity11 ’ court on tuesday and thursday , the dock officers are moved to the crown court across the road			0
surprise : speaking after his sentencing , @entity8 laughed how he could have walked free from court ‘ all prisoners at @entity11 go to @entity169 on tuesday and @entity148 on thursday			1
on monday , wednesday and friday , @entity148 and @entity147 prisoners then move to @entity11			0
‘ this has caused massive delays in the courts and no one has thought to plan this through at all - it was an accident waiting to happen			2
‘ the court has probation breach cases and trials on tuesday and thursday , but if someone is convicted , they ca n’t go to prison straight away			0
‘ this applies to everyone , even someone who has committed a serious assault - it is just a matter of time before someone does a runner			1
it is an absolute joke			0
‘ with the case of @entity8 , although they had officers and vans across the road at the crown court , they did n’t think to call them to walk across the road and deal with the problem , ‘ it is lucky he did n’t escape			1
mr @entity8 is the only incident so far , but i believe this closing of the cells will be happening on a national scale soon			1
’ a spokesman from @entity206 insisted @entity8 was not considered a risk to the public			2
he said : ‘ @entity209 does not list custody cases on thursdays			0
‘ this was an unexpected custody case and the defendant was required to wait on court premises for an hour to be collected by the prisoner escort service			2
‘ the defendant was not considered a risk to the public by the court and remained inside the building during this time			0

@entity8 , 19 , was asked to wait at back of @entity56
boasts he could have easily ' done a runner ' after getting 16 - week jail term
during hour - long delay he used vending machine and smoked in toilets
