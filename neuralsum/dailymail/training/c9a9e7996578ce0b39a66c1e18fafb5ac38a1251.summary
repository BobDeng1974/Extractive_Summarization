suffering : @entity9 , 43 , before she developed gastroparesis ( left ) and after			1
she is begging the @entity5 for an operation that could help her to live a ' near - normal life ' her weight has plummetted from 12st in 2010 to just seven stone today and she has been forced to give up her job as a primary school teaching assistant because of sickness and lack of energy			1
mrs @entity9 has been battling for an operation which she hopes would help her to live a ' near - normal life '			1
a consultant in @entity33 suggested she have a gastric pacemaker fitted - designed to stimulate her stomach - and referred her to the @entity5 for treatment			2
but @entity38 & @entity37 told her the operation , which costs up to £ 35,000 , is not a proven solution to her illness and its funding panel rejected her application and her appeal			2
staying alive : mrs @entity45 with the @entity47 infinity pump that feeds her directly via her stomach			1
she must use it between 6pm and 9am every day mrs @entity9 , who is married to @entity49 , 27 , and has two sons , @entity51 , 15 , and @entity52 , 17 , said that it was a ' heart - breaking decision ' , with her condition leaving her unable to look after her family			1
' i would n’t be able to stand up long enough to make a whole meal for anyone , ' she said			0
' not being able to look after them is the biggest problem for me			0
' mrs @entity9 said her pump had to run between 6pm and 9am every day			1
on the rare occasions she 's up at those times , she must carry a special backpack containing the mechanism			0
a tube remains connected to her body which passes through her abdomen into her stomach and feeds her small amounts of food each hour			1
' if i eat or drink anything , i vomit , ' she said			1
' and i ’m in constant pain - i have to take painkillers every day			0
' the condition is incurable but i ’m told this operation could help me lead a near - normal life , stopping the nausea , and helping me gain weight and energy			2
' despite the double - rejection , mrs @entity9 said she would not give up the fight and would try to apply for the operation again			2
' i ’m trying to be referred to a different expert who has experience of several gastric pacemaker operations , ' she said			0
' hopefully he will be able to add evidence to my application			0
' she added : ' i have spoken to one patient in @entity94 who has told me it has helped her have a much better quality of life			0
if they can have it , why ca n’t i ? ' the trust said it judged each application for funding on its merits			0
' funding panels consider clinical circumstances of patients , expected risks and benefits of the treatment proposed , the clinical evidence supporting the treatment and cost of the treatment , ' a spokesman said			0
' applications are approved when sufficient evidence is show that treatment is likely to be clinically effective			0
