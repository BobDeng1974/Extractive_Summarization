by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 4 november 2013 @entity1 is developing a reputation for ‘ accidentally ’ leaking images of its upcoming devices , and it appears to have done it again with what ’s rumoured to be a new 8 - inch tablet			1
dubbed ' @entity10 ' by speculators , the tablet is shown in a promotional image on the firm ’s @entity13 and entertainment page and if the rumours are true , would make the tablet just 0.1 inches smaller than the ipad mini			1
it appears to be running @entity1 ’s latest @entity13 4.4 @entity21 operating system and is a slightly different shape than the current 7 - inch , @entity23			1
the shots of the so - called @entity10 , pictured , are shown on @entity1 's @entity13 and entertainment page			1
it has a different shape and smaller bezels than the search giant 's current @entity23 device			1
an 8 - inch tablet would more closely compete with @entity32 's 7.9 - inch ipad mini @entity1 has a series of mysterious containers docked off the coast of @entity36			2
one rumour claimed it was a research centre , while another said it was a showroom for @entity1 products			0
a @entity41 investigation recently uncovered a second structure being built hastily at the top secret site			0
the huge structure is made up of shipping containers and looks set to be identical to the first			0
another identical barge has been spotted on the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50			0
such is the level of secrecy surrounding the project even members of the @entity55 have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements along with the teams of engineers and welders who have been working there			0
if @entity1 is working on an 8 - inch tablet it will compete more closely with the ipad mini which deliberately has a 7.9 - inch screen designed to distinguish it from other smaller tablets on the market			2
@entity1 announced its @entity68 handset last week with few surprising features			1
this was because images of the phone were leaked during a promotional video for @entity74 back in september			0
the phone ’s specifications were then leaked in an online manual , and the device later appeared on @entity1 ’s official @entity79 alongside the @entity23 and @entity81 tablets all before the device was even officially unveiled			1
rumours about a @entity23 8 emerged at the start of the year but died down after the firm released its @entity10 7 by @entity87 tablet in july			2
the picture of the so - called @entity10 on the @entity90 and entertainment page ca n’t be the latest nexus 7 device because it appears to have a slightly different shape			1
rumours about a @entity23 8 emerged at the start of the year but died down after the firm released its @entity10 7 by @entity87 tablet in july , pictured			2
the bezels at the bottom of the leaked device are smaller than on the current @entity23			1
the nexus 8 is also shown running @entity1 's latest @entity13 4.4 @entity21 operating system it also has fewer bezels at the top and bottom of the device			1
these are the areas of the tablet where owners can comfortably hold the tablet without touching or interfering with the screen			0
the bottom bezel on the @entity23 , for example , is much thicker than on the leaked images of the rumoured 8 - inch model			0
the image was first spotted by a member called @entity114			0
@entity1 does n’t manufacture its devices ; the phones are made by @entity117 and the latest tablets have been made by @entity87			0
similarities with the @entity10 to the @entity121 tablet could suggest @entity1 will ditch @entity87 and work with @entity117 on its tablets , too			2
@entity1 announced its @entity68 handset , pictured , last week after months of leaked images and specifications			1
it was the first device to run the new @entity13 4.4 @entity21 operating system			0
the 4g - ready handset starts at £ 299 for @entity129 or £ 339 for @entity130 the @entity10 7 by @entity87 , released in july , has a seven - inch , 1980x1200 display , which at the time was the world 's highest resolution screen			2
it has a @entity137 rear - facing camera for the first time , and a faster @entity140 processor compared to the first - generation nexus 7 device			0
@entity1 's @entity10 is expected to be an upgraded version of the @entity23 but no other specifications have been announced .			1

the so - called ' @entity10 ' is displayed on the company 's promotional @entity13 and entertainment page
it has *square* edges and what appears to be a hard shell rear case
the bezels are smaller than on the @entity23 , suggesting it is a new device
@entity157 comes less than a week since @entity1 unveiled its @entity68 phone
