@entity2 's bid to legislate for a referendum on @entity4 leaving the @entity5 has been blocked by the @entity6 , @entity0 can reveal			1
the prime minister is understood to have urged @entity8 to give the people a say on @entity11 , but the @entity6 leader refused to give government time for the @entity14 to pass through the @entity15			1
mr @entity2 has pinned his hopes on the promise of an in - out vote to win back @entity20 supporters , but support for @entity23 's party has soared to a new record high			1
@entity2 urged @entity8 to clear the way for the @entity14 to become law , but the pleas were rejected , the @entity25 claim the coalition is bitterly divided on the idea of staging a referendum on @entity4 remaining in the bloc of 28 @entity11 countries			1
mr @entity2 has promised that if he is still prime minister after the next election he will renegotiate membership of the @entity5 before staging in an in - out vote by 2017			1
the @entity25 were hoping to use a backbench bill to pass the necessary legislation , but claim the move has been scuppered by mr @entity8			1
the @entity6 demanded that in exchange for support for the @entity5 referendum the @entity25 had to allow a backbench bill to curb the bedroom tax to continue			1
@entity46 mp @entity45 , who was taking the @entity47 through @entity48 , told @entity0 : ' the @entity6 have killed off our chances of putting into law , this side of an election , an in out @entity5 referendum by 2017			1
' they did n't have the guts to vote against an @entity5 referendum in the @entity58			2
instead they have used @entity61 tricks to try to deny the @entity4 people a say on their membership of the @entity5			1
' the row centres on the need for a money resolution to be granted to allow the @entity14 to make progress through the @entity15			0
the @entity6 granted the resolution for a similar @entity47 last year , but the @entity25 say it has been refused this time			2
it is claimed mr @entity8 demanded changes to housing benefit – dubbed the ' bedroom tax ' – as a price for agreement to allow the @entity74 to continue			1
@entity46 mp @entity45 , who was trying to pass a law for an @entity5 referendum , blamed the @entity6 for blocking its passage through @entity48 the @entity6 say the @entity25 offered to grant a money resolution to @entity6 mp @entity79 's @entity47 on the bedroom tax , but demanded both a money resolution and government time for mr @entity45 ’s backbench bill on the @entity5 referendum			1
@entity6 deputy leader @entity6 said : ' there is a completely reasonable deal on the table here – each party gets a money bill for a @entity90 they feel strongly about			0
' a senior @entity6 source added : ' but the @entity25 are putting forward a proposal they know for certain will be turned down by the @entity6 – a completely unfair deal			0
' they know we are not about to sign up to their bill being given government time when it is neither the @entity6 position , nor the @entity99 's , especially when they are not prepared to offer anything in return			1
the @entity99 is a two - way street			0
' the @entity6 were never going to block their referendum bill			0
we were happy to allow them to try and get it passed in the @entity58			0
' but the truth is they have folded like a cheap deck chair and are trying to make us take the blame by adding ridiculous conditions they knew we would not and could not accept			0
' the only logical conclusion that can be reached is that the @entity25 do n't really want their bill to pass and are trying to set the @entity6 up as the scapegoats			2
why else would they put forward a proposal they know can not be agreed ? ' the @entity46 say the @entity6 policy to ease the pressure of the benefits changes would cost £ 1billion			1
but a senior @entity6 source said it would only cost £ 300million			0
mr @entity45 added : ' this is will now be a major issue at the general election			0
two parties – @entity127 and @entity6 – have done everything they can to stop a referendum			0
' @entity20 are n't able to offer a referendum and a vote for them makes the prospect of a @entity127 government led by @entity135 and @entity136 , who do n't want a referendum , more likely			2
' only @entity2 and the @entity46 are offering a renegotiation followed by an in - out referendum by 2017 if we are returned to office after the general election			1
' a new poll today showed support for @entity20 has surged to a record level of support in the wake of @entity149 ' demands for an extra £ 1.7billion from @entity4			2
@entity20 has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a @entity154 telephone poll in june some 19 per cent of people now say they will back @entity23 's party , twice the level seen early last year			2
mr @entity23 last night said the @entity5 should be told to ' get stuffed ' and said the demand had been a ' gift ' to his party			0
the rise of @entity20 has come at the expense of both the main parties , with @entity127 slumped at the lowest level of support since @entity135 became leader			2
the @entity25 and @entity127 are neck and neck on just 30 per cent , the @entity154 survey for @entity169 showed			0
senior @entity25 have pleaded with even voters who want to leave the @entity5 to stay with the @entity25			0
defence secretary @entity171 told @entity174 's @entity173 show : ' if you want change in @entity11 , if you want a referendum on @entity11 , if you are against @entity11 and want to leave , the only party that will give you that vote is the conservatives			0

**tories** hope promise of a say on leaving the @entity5 will *woo* @entity20 supporters
