forget fancy sheets and down - filled duvets , the perfect pillow is the key to a good night ’s sleep			1
on average , we rest our weary heads on our pillows for more than 2,500 hours — or the equivalent of more than 100 days and nights — per year , so it ’s certainly worth getting the right one			1
and while once our choice was limited to feather or fibre , the shops are now stuffed with everything from water pillows to scented pillows , and even one which is wired for sound			1
but which is a pain in the neck and which is a dream come true ? @entity23 @entity25 @entity24 , £ 22.99 , livingiseasy.co.uk in @entity27 , buckwheat pillows were so prized that grandmothers handed them down to their grandchildren			1
my children are n’t quite as easily pleased			0
when i showed them this thick , heavy pillow with an industrial - looking cotton cover , they were n’t impressed			1
this feels like a giant , heavy beanbag and looks like a prop from @entity38			0
billed as the ultimate eco-pillow , it ’s filled with the tiny husks which protect the kernel of the buckwheat grain			1
in summer , you can chill it in the fridge for a few hours to keep you cool throughout the night			0
it also soothes stiff muscles — as the chill will reduce inflammation and help numb any pain			0
it does n’t look impressive , but it shapes beautifully around my shoulders and neck			0
it makes a slight rustling as the tiny hulls shift , but i had a great night ’s sleep			1
all i needed was @entity60 beside me , and my dream would have been complete			0
4/5 marriage @entity62 reversible @entity63 , £ 35 , marksandspencer.com i ’ve had some spectacular rows over pillows			1
my husband , @entity66 , likes a firmer pillow , while i like a lovely soft one , but i hate buying different types as we inevitably get them mixed up and we both have a bad night			1
can @entity72 solve the dilemma with this unique two - sided pillow ? one side — made from a very firm memory foam — suits @entity66 perfectly , but is far too rigid for me			1
the other side , made from synthetic microfibre filling , is perfectly soft and squishy			1
at 6in thick , it ’s a little higher than some we tried , but this clever pillow still gave me a good night ’s sleep			1
we both woke up happy , and that ’s good enough for me ! 4/5 a smelly @entity84 @entity85 , £ 9.99 , argos.co.uk i was hoping for the soft scent of lavender gently lulling me to sleep , but instead i got a rather sickly synthetic pong wafting up from the filling			1
definitely more lavatory than lavender			0
the lightweight pillow made of polyester did n’t improve my sleep any more than any other ones i tried			1
synthetic fillings are the most popular type of pillows in the @entity100 , because they are cheap			1
but let ’s face it , if i wanted the scent of @entity104 at bedtime , i ’d be better off spraying @entity66 as he lay beside me snoring			0
at 3.5in thick , it is soft but offers little support , and i woke feeling uncomfortable and grumpy			0
and cheap ! @entity108 , £ 3.49 , @entity109 budget pillows tend to be thin , bounce - free and crackling with static electricity			1
so i was delighted to find these bargain - basement microfibre - filled pillows are generously stuffed and incredibly silky to touch			1
because they are filled with bundles of ultra-fine synthetic fibre , the pillows are wonderfully soft			1
my 16 - year - old daughter , @entity118 , the fussiest sleeper since the princess and the pea , declared it the best pillow she had ever tried			2
a similar synthetic pillow from @entity124 would set me back £ 35 , which makes this — at under a fiver — a total winner			1
synthetic pillows have the shortest lifespan of all — from six months to two years before they flatten or fall out of shape — but at this price , who cares			2
this pillow is just under 4in thick , but flattens due to the synthetic filling , so if you prefer height you ’ll need two			2
5/5 @entity138 - free sleep @entity140 , £ 59 , sleepangelworld.com more dust mites live in the bedroom than anywhere else in the house — and they make a beeline for warm bedding			1
this anti-allergy pillow contains a four - layer filter designed to block germs , bacteria , mould and allergens			2
the waterproof , wipe - clean cover is heat - sealed , with no seams or needle marks to let in germs			0
it sounds impressive , but to test the effectiveness i used a pillow for three months before sending it to an independent laboratory			1
scientists took samples of the foam filling and confirmed it was completely free of any nasties			0
with a 13 - year - old son who suffers from asthma — a condition often triggered by mould and dust mites — this was reassuring			0
it is 3.5in thick , with little give thanks to the memory foam filling			0
the price tag is hefty , but totally worth it for a wheeze - free son			0
i ’ve passed this on to @entity181 for an unbroken night of sleep			2
4/5 music to my ears @entity185 , £ 17.99 firebox.com since my three children became teenagers , the task of persuading them to go to bed at night has become my worst nightmare			2
could this high - tech pillow — wired for sound as they plug in their ipods to the external lead which connects to a speaker hidden inside — work miracles ? certainly , it ’s the only time i ’ve ever seen them excited about going to bed , and i was stunned to see my son @entity202 jump in before i ’d issued a single threat			2
but the sort of music i hear thumping out of his pillow minutes later is n’t exactly restful ! luckily , the pillow muffles the sound for the rest of us			2
the pillow is not very thick ( at 3in deep ) or supportive			2
a winner for anyone aged 13 - 19 and for parents who are desperate for peace and quiet ! 3/5 the @entity218 @entity219 , £ 88 for two , soakandsleep.com down pillows are the softest and most luxurious type available and often come with a price tag to match			1
these ones are made by a small family firm in @entity225			0
the filling is washed in thermal spring water — so there are no nasty chemicals involved			0
each pillow is double - stitched for strength and edged with gold piping for luxury you ’ve never seen outside a five - star hotel			1
no wonder these pillows have amassed their own online following — as well as demand from top hotels around the world			2
feels like sleeping on a giant marshmallow — it really is a luxury treat			2
just one sumptuous pillow , measuring 5in thick — was enough for a perfect night ’s sleep			1
5/5 like sleeping on a @entity246 @entity247 , £ 39.99 , @entity248 water pillows are fast becoming a trend — to keep cool or help sore necks and shoulders			1
they contain a pouch that you fill with water by opening the rubber seal , and pouring your water in			0
this means you can actually choose the height of your own pillow , depending on how you sleep best			1
my first attempt at filling it goes wrong			0
i pour so much water inside that it feels like i ’m sleeping on a @entity266			0
a thermal insulator keeps the water cool , while an anti-allergy cushion of polyester fibres surround the inner water chamber , making it look and feel like any other pillow			2
the first night did n’t go well , as my neck felt too high			0
but i simply let water out the next day , taking the pillow from 5in thick to 3in , and i slept like a baby			2
3/5 @entity277 @entity278 , £ 24.99 , dunelm - @entity279 wool is nature ’s best temperature regulator — staying cool in summer and warm in winter			2
but can a pillow stuffed with wiry wool instead of lovely bouncy feathers offer as much comfort ? the answer is yes			0
as i sink into the warm pillow i feel instantly comforted			0
wool naturally absorbs moisture and scientists say the average sleeper gives off nearly a pint of water vapour			0
if you suffer from menopausal night sweats , this can rise to well over that			0
once absorbed , the moisture quickly evaporates from the porous wool cells , so what looks like a normal pillow is actually a natural air conditioning unit			0
at 3in thick , this pillow is thinner and has less give , but it supported my sore neck — strained as i walked the dog — well			0
i slept well and woke feeling cool and refreshed			0

does finding the perfect pillow really need to break the bank ?
