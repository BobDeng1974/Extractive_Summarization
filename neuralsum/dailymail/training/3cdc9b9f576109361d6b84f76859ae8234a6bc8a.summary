by @entity1 reporter published : 09:40 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 13 september 2013 a semiautomatic rifle that mimics the rapid fire of a machine gun is about to hit the shelves			1
the @entity6 , made by @entity8 company , @entity7 , is fed bullets from a belt , which gives it the potential to have thousands of rounds of ammunition			1
the weapon will be available this autumn and will sell for $ 6,000 , according to @entity16 , the sales and marketing manager for @entity7			1
he said the gun ‘ sprays like a fire hose ’			0
‘ we recommend no more than 30 rounds on the belt , but one person could make it as big as they want			0
automatic firearms also include short - barreled shotguns and short - barreled rifles			0
a machine gun can normally fire between 400 and 1,000 bullets per minute , or between 7 and 17 rounds per second			1
but the manufacturers of the @entity6 , also called a ‘ bump gun ’ , found a loop hole			1
of the pieces that make up a gun , the @entity30 ( @entity62 ) only regulates the ‘ receiver ’			0
it is the only piece that has a serial number and the only one that requires a background check to purchase			0
@entity7 's technology uses the recoil of the rifle shot to ‘ bump ’ the gun , speeding up the rate of fire without changing the gun 's classification as a semiautomatic			1
to be classified as a semiautomatic , the gun is only allowed to fire one round each time the trigger is pulled			2
multiple bullets : just like this machine gun , the bump gun can fire thousands of rounds from a belt @entity88 : a normal assault rifle ( pictured ) does not have the bump stock ' recoil ' part that moves back and forth to fire the bullets faster in a video advertisement for the gun , the company states that this type of ' slide stock ' technology gives people the ability to ' bump fire more safely ' offering ' another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere '			1
according to the company , the ' muscular application of force to create forward movement of the firearm defines the will of the shooter to discharge each individual round of ammunition			0
‘ each discharge requires a separate decision by the operator to move the firearm back to a firing condition , ’ says the ad			0
and so , the gun is technically legal			0
in a 2010 letter posted on @entity7 's website , the @entity62 wrote : ‘ we find that the ' bump - stock ' is a firearm part and is not regulated as firearm under the @entity123 or the @entity51			0
’ @entity62 spokesman , @entity124 , told @entity125 : ‘ i can confirm that @entity62 did approve the device referenced in the letter and that the @entity7 is legal			0
’ @entity7 , based in @entity128 , @entity8 , already sells bump - stocks for $ 370 that speed up the rate of fire for semiautomatics			1
the company also sells semiautomatic rifles that have already been accessorised for bump - fire , costing between $ 1,150 to $ 1,950			2
but these guns use magazines , not belts , and thus have limited ammo capacity			0
a spokeswoman for @entity141 , one of the largest gun sellers in @entity144 , said the company does not sell @entity7 products , and will not be offering the belt - fed rifle			2
machine guns : automatic assault rifles can fire up to 1,000 rounds a minute just by holding the trigger reborn : @entity7 's new gun has been called ' a poor man 's machine gun ' by weapons shop owners @entity157 , owner of the @entity158 , located about 50 miles away from @entity7 's headquarters , told @entity125 that the company 's bump - fire accessories are quite popular with his customers			1
but @entity157 , who referred to the @entity7 products as ‘ a poor man 's machine gun ’ , does n't plan to sell the belt - fed gun , because he does n't believe there will be much of a demand for it			1
he said the @entity7 rifle is a bit more challenging to fire than a fully automatic weapon			2
‘ it 's not as easy [ as full auto ] , but it 's fairly idiot proof , ’ he said			0
it has been unlawful since 1934 , under @entity177 , for civilians to own machine guns without special permission from the @entity181			2
since the @entity184 of may 19 , 1986 , ownership of newly manufactured machine guns has been prohibited to civilians .			1

the @entity6 ' bump gun ' is fed bullets from a belt and can fire thousands of rounds at a time
it will go on sale this autumn for $ 6,000
the weapon uses the recoil to ' bump ' the gun , speeding up the rate of fire
it is technically still a semiautomatic weapon , which means it can be sold to the general public
newly - manufactured automatic weapons , such as machine guns , are *illegal* for civilians to buy
a machine gun can normally fire up to 1,000 bullets per minute
