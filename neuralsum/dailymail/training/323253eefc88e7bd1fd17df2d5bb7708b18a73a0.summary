by @entity0 @entity1 , husband of @entity3 host @entity2 and a first - time dad - to - be , has undertaken a ' @entity6 ' segment on his wife 's @entity7 , just two months before the birth of the couple 's first child			1
mr @entity12 , 45 , a @entity13 communications strategist , took a trip to the @entity15 in @entity16 , along with friend and today host @entity18 , to speak with a labor and delivery nurse			0
' they say nothing really prepares you for parenthood , i think that 's definitely true , ' mr @entity18 - himself a father - of - two - remarks			2
' but i tried at least to give my buddy @entity29 a little @entity31 version of early fatherhood before that little delivery arrives in a couple of months			1
' taking notes : @entity12 ( right ) is taught how to be a supportive husband ahead of his wife @entity2 's labor in two months - whose position is improvised here by today host @entity41 ( bottom left ) no weight worries : ms @entity2 , pictured earlier this month , recently revealed that she has so far gained 30lbs during her pregnancy , which her @entity45 advised her not to ' worry ' about the first and foremost rule in the delivery room ? ' make her happy , make her comfortable — [ that ’s the ] most important thing to do , ' nurse @entity49 , advises , as mr @entity12 nods eagerly			2
' the biggest mistake is apologizing when mom is yelling , ' ms @entity49 continues			0
' just agree with her			0
' both mr @entity12 and mr @entity18 wear expressions of undeniable trepidation as the lesson continues			0
next , mr @entity18 enthusiastically assumes the position of a woman in labor , lying back on the bed , his legs akimbo , while a visibly nervous but notably focused mr @entity12 appears busy taking mental notes			0
just like this : mr @entity18 ( left ) , who is himself a father - of - two , enthusiastically passes on his daddy tips to mr @entity12 ( right ) , including the all - important knack of supporting of the baby 's neck supportive buddy : mr @entity18 outright laughs as mr @entity12 struggles to work out the changing of a diaper ( pictured ) ' when it 's time to push , grab a leg - she 'll be screaming at you - just " yes " her to death , ' instructs ms @entity49 , as mr @entity12 repeats ' yes ! yes ! ' emphatically , much to the amusement of mr @entity18 , who seems to be rather enjoying his role - play scenario			2
once the fictional baby is ' born ' , it 's onto the next set of lessons			2
mr @entity12 is handed a doll , repeatedly forgetting to ' support its neck ' , despite several reminders , and struggles comically with attaching a diaper			0
' at this point , ' says ms @entity49 as mr @entity12 scrabbles to ' change ' the doll , ' the baby will be peeing on you			0
' having a ball : the pair dutifully immerse themselves in the ' @entity6 ' role play @entity95 : @entity96 looked radiant sporting a snug green dress as she clutched the hand of her husband presumably much to his relief , the final part of the segment see 's mr @entity12 reunited with his wife @entity96 , who is positively glowing , dressed in a stretchy lime green dress			1
the happy couple clutch hands for a quick chat with @entity107 , an actor and author of @entity110 , and @entity111 , a basketball player for the @entity112 , both of them fathers			0
mr @entity12 is advised to ' make time ' for his child , ' read to him or her before bedtime ' and ' @entity119 with his family ' when he 's away from home			1
' what about back massages for the wife ? ' @entity96 gamely interjects , closing the segment			1
' i 'm so happy to be able to call him my husband , it 's still strange saying " my husband " , but great ' the couple first met in 2008 when @entity96 attended mr @entity12 's 40th birthday party with a mutual friend and they began dating a few months later			1
they got engaged last may during a trip to the @entity136 and @entity137 , and tied the knot in march outside ms @entity2 's home town of @entity140 , @entity141 , without publicizing the event to media			0
during the course of the evening the newlyweds privately announced to family and friends that they were expecting a child			0
wedded bliss : ms @entity2 married her husband @entity12 at their ' surprise ' wedding in march ( pictured ) and publicly announced her pregnancy a few days later @entity96 later went public with her ' surprise ' wedding and pregnancy news on the today show			1
after marrying her husband , @entity96 said : ' i 'm so happy to be able to call him my husband , it 's still strange saying " my husband " , but great			1
' the couple have chosen not find out the sex of their baby until it is born in august , and it has not yet been revealed who will fill in for @entity96 on the today show during her maternity leave .			1

@entity96 , *42* , will give birth to the couple 's first child in august
