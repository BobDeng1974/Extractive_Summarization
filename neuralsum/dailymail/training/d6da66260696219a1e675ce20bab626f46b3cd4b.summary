traditionally , a sandwich shop is a pretty good place to work out where someone is from – do they order a roll , a bap or a barm ? these days , however , it might not be such an accurate marker			2
because wherever we live , more and more of us are now using ‘ roll ’ , once a southern word			1
roll , barm or bap ? participants were shown a picture of everyday objects including a pair of trousers , a pair of shoes and what southerners would call a roll , and asked what word they would use for them a survey found that while many regional divisions remain , they are slowly being worn away – particularly when it comes to the word for a soft piece of bread			1
linguistics researchers at @entity32 surveyed 1,400 people from @entity34 in @entity35 down to @entity36			1
they ranged in age from ten to 87			0
the participants were shown a picture of everyday objects including a pair of trousers , a pair of shoes and what southerners would call a roll , and asked what word they would use for them			1
the researchers then compared their results with maps put together several decades ago			1
the results showed that the word ‘ bun ’ is still common in @entity54 , ‘ barm ’ and ‘ muffin ’ are used in the @entity56 , ‘ tea cake ’ north of @entity57 and ‘ cob ’ in the @entity60			0
but the word ‘ roll ’ – which used to be used largely by those in the @entity63 – is now used throughout the country , with more than a third of those who responded choosing it			0
the southern word trousers is also used across the country , whereas the word ‘ pants ’ is restricted mostly to the @entity56			1
the words ‘ pumps ’ and ‘ plimsolls ’ are used across the country , but the former is more prevalent in the @entity56 and the latter in the @entity63			0
@entity78 is also becoming more southern			1
dr @entity79 , who led the study , said : ‘ this research shows a clear @entity82 in many of the words we choose to use when describing everyday items , and the way we pronounce them			1
@entity63 divide : the southern word trousers is also used across the country , whereas the word pants is restricted mostly to the @entity56			1
the words pumps and plimsolls are used across the country , but the former is more prevalent in the @entity56 and the latter in the @entity63 ‘ variation is pervasive in language , and often correlates with social factors , like age , socio - economic status and a person ’s place of origin			0
‘ however , we ’ve compared our maps to those put together a few decades ago , and it looks like the southern pronunciation is slowly creeping northward			1
’ despite that , there are still significant regional variations in pronunciation			2
for example ‘ one ’ and ‘ gone ’ typically rhyme when spoken by northerners , but not southerners			0
those in the @entity60 , meanwhile , could not make up their mind if they were northern or southern			2
like northerners , they rhyme ‘ one ’ and ‘ gone ’ , but follow the @entity63 in failing to rhyme the words ‘ foot ’ and ‘ strut ’			0
dr @entity79 added : ‘ it ’s not clear why different words are used to describe the same thing in different parts of the country			0
‘ there are sometimes anecdotal explanations – for instance , daps , the @entity134 ’s word for sports shoes , is said to be an abbreviation of @entity137			0
’ the source of regional differences in pronunciation is often more clearly understood			2
dr @entity79 explained : ‘ the northern way of rhyming the words ‘ put ’ and ‘ cut ’ , for example , is faithful to how these words were pronounced centuries ago			0
‘ speakers in the @entity63 moved away from this pronunciation in the 1500s , but their way of saying these words did n’t make it to the @entity56			2
