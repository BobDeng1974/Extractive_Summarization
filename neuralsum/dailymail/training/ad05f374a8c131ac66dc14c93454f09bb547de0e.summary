the advert for a ' customer - facing passenger assistant ' has been criticised as ' gobbledegook ' the job adverts for a ‘ passenger assistant ’ stressed that a ‘ good face - to - face communicator ’ was required who must have ‘ customer - facing experience ’			1
not to mention having a ‘ natural flair for going the extra mile ’ and being fit enough to stand for lengthy periods			2
in other words , a bus conductor			2
candidates were further informed that they would work on a ‘ unique ’ new double - decker bus which was ‘ accessible ’ and ‘ convenient ’ and asked if they had ‘ the kind of personality that made last year ’s @entity20 gamesmakers so successful ’			1
the @entity21 – which promotes concise writing – summed up the ads as ‘ gobbledegook ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ what seems like a great idea is certainly getting lost in translation here			2
“ wanted – helpful bus conductor ” would seem a lot clearer			2
’ the @entity32 bus company placed the ads in newspapers and on the internet			0
‘ the primary role of the passenger assistant is to travel the length of the route and ensure that passengers board and alight the bus safely , ’ said an online description			1
‘ as part of the role it ’s your responsibility to be visible to passengers by patrolling both the lower and upper deck and be proactive in assisting with general inquiries			1
’ the advert calls for applicants with the ' same kind of personality ' as the @entity55 gamesmakers the @entity57 spokesman added : ‘ the prospective clippie must now undertake “ routine patrols ” and be a “ visible presence ” – which of course makes us wonder what fun it would be to be an invisible presence instead			1
’ a @entity32 spokesman said : ‘ we have reviewed our advert and are happy with the content			1
‘ the advert has been successful and has generated a very large number of applications			1
’ @entity72 previously won an award for his ' cyclised city ' comment @entity76 , councils , politicians and even sportspeople have been mocked by @entity21 for their awkward use of @entity57			1
the organisation holds an annual awards for the most baffling and awkward statements			0
last year , @entity83 , was awarded the dubious honour for this baffling response to a bid to open a new pharmacy at @entity88			0
it wrote : ' there was not currently a gap on the spectrum of adequacy sufficient to conclude that the provision of pharmaceutical services is not currently secured to the standard of adequacy , ' the committee explained as it rejected the application			0
@entity99 also won an award after it reported that it planned to adopt a ' dashboard approach to performance reporting and assurance '			0
@entity104 , the defeated @entity105 presidential candidate , was named as the winner of the ' @entity108 ' award for spoken gibberish after regularly tying himself in knots during the @entity112 election campaign			0
in one particularly confusing episode , he told voters : ' i believe in an @entity112 where millions of @entity112 believe in an @entity112 that 's the @entity112 millions of @entity112 believe in			0
' previous winners have included mayor of london @entity72 , who called for @entity120 to become ' a cyclised city '			0
in 2010 , @entity123 and @entity124 player @entity122 won the @entity108 for his incorrect use of the word ' literally ' and other gaffes			0
examples included : ' these balls now - they literally explode off your feet			2
' and : ' @entity132 makes runs into the box better than anyone			0

@entity21 criticised @entity138 for the advert
@entity141 phrases like ' good face - to - face communicator ' were gobbledegook
' passenger assistant ' to be ' visible to passengers by patrolling both the lower and upper deck and be proactive in assisting with general inquiries '
