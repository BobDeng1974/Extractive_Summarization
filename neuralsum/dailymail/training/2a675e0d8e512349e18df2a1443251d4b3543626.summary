currently the only way of spotting cars on dark country roads is by their lights			0
but @entity5 has trialled technology that means cars could glow - in - the - dark on the roads to become more visible			1
the @entity10 car manufacturer has become the first to apply uv absorbing paint on a production car			1
the ' ultraviolet - energised paint ' on the @entity21 electric car is a demonstration of a secret paint formula made up of organic materials			1
use the slider , above to see the car glow after dark the ‘ ultraviolet - energised paint ’ on the @entity21 electric car is a demonstration of a secret paint formula made up of organic materials			1
known as @entity31 , the paint is applied by spraying and absorbs uv energy from the sun throughout the day			1
it is able to glow for between eight and 10 hours when the sun goes down			0
the paint is the brainchild of @entity39 - based inventor @entity38 , who is already trialling glow - in - the - dark cycle paths in @entity41			1

it is the creation of @entity39 - based inventor @entity38 , who is already trialling grow - in - the - dark cycle paths in @entity41 the paint is able to glow for between eight and 10 hours when the sun goes down ( pictured )			1
it ’s made from very rare earth materials , including @entity51 , which is solid , odourless and chemically and biologically inert it ’s made from very rare earth materials , including @entity51 , which is solid , odourless and chemically and biologically inert			2
however , the paint option wo n't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale			2
people can , however , have the treatment applied to their own car or buy uv car ‘ wraps ’ to enable their car to glow - in - the - dark			1
this would enable them to find their car easily in a dark car park , as well as making them more visible on pitch black roads			2
@entity5 told @entity68 that if the paint was ever offered , the glow would probably last for around 25 years			1
the experiment was done to showcase the increasing number of @entity21 owners who are charging their cars using solar energy			2
@entity5 says its eco-friendly car costs less than two pence per mile to run and that 89 per cent of @entity21 owners in the @entity78 charge their cars at home overnight			2
the paint option wo n't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients in the paint mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale			2
however , glow - in - the - dark cars could prove useful for making vehicles extra visble on dark country roads ( pictured ) a trial of the @entity31 technology is under way in @entity41 city centre , where a spray has been applied to cyclepaths to make them glow			1
the luminescent , rain - resistant coating could one day replace street lights			0
it is applied in three layers , with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs uv energy during the day , which is then released as a blue glow when it 's dark			1
the system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together			0
according to the @entity112 , the company behind the technology , it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac , concrete and wood			0
unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls , @entity31 reacts to varying levels of ambient light			1
‘ this product adjusts to the natural light , so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances , ’ said mr @entity38 , who owns the firm			0
‘ if the sky is lighter , it wo n’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly , it ’s almost like it has a mind of its own			0
’ @entity135 has teamed up with car manufacturer @entity5 to develop new self - driving cars that could be used to race across the surface of @entity139			1
the technology created during the five - year partnership will also be adapted to create better driverless vehicles that can be used on roads on @entity144			0
robotics experts from the space agency will work with engineers from @entity5 to adapt the company 's electric leaf cars			0
future rovers on @entity139 could look more like @entity5 's @entity21 electric cars ( pictured ) as the automobile manufacturer is to develop technology jointly with @entity135 to create self - driving vehicles that could be used on @entity144 and in space @entity5 has pledged to have autonomous cars on the market by 2020 , but the technology currently faces significant challenges to cope with the dangers of public roads			2
however , @entity135 believes sensors and systems being developed to help driverless cars deal with pedestrians , cyclists , overtaking vehicles and parked cars , could also help to develop new robotic rovers for use in exploring other planets			0
t is not the first project that @entity135 and @entity5 have collaborated on			0
in 2005 the two organisations teamed up to develop more comfortable and safer car seats			0
@entity5 drew upon data from @entity135 's @entity177 at its @entity178 that had used experiments from space to examine the neutral body position of astronauts while they were sitting in low gravity			0
@entity5 used this to build seats for its cars that would lower the amount of fatigue drivers would feel and reduce pressure spots .			0

@entity5 is first car maker to apply @entity193 absorbing paint on a production car
experiment uses @entity31 paint made from rare organic ingredients
it absorbs uv energy during the day so it can glow through the night
@entity39 - based inventor @entity38 invented the paint , which is also being used for glow - in - the - dark cycle paths in @entity41
