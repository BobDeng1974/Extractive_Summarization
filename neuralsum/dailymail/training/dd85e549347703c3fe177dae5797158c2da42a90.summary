the watchdog which monitors their expenses says 148 mps made claims to rent larger properties for their young families , and claimed back money for their children ’s train journeys			1
these arrangements are within the rules , which were changed after the 2009 expenses scandal to allow mps with children to claim thousands of pounds more than others			1
however critics say such arrangements , revealed last night under freedom of information laws , would be unthinkable in the private sector , and are still too generous			0

@entity47 ’s chairman sir @entity48 is expected to defend the move today , with a speech in which he will argue ‘ you get what you pay for ’ but @entity53 , the treasury chief secretary told the @entity54 that voters would be ‘ appalled ’ if politicians accepted a huge rise while salaries in the rest of the public sector have been capped			2

‘ mps have not seen the proposals as yet but i hope that when they come forward that they reflect the pay situation in the rest of the public sector and the very difficult economic circumstances we are in			2
’ @entity47 will not publish its long - awaited proposals for @entity66 ’ pay and pensions until next week , and it is not expected it will come in until 2015			0
but the body , which was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal , is widely expected to propose a pay rise of up to £ 10,000 , coupled with cuts to mps ’ gold - plated pension			2

claiming : culture secretary @entity34 is also among the nine claiming			2
these arrangements are within the rules , which were changed after the 2009 expenses scandal many mps insist that the necessity to have two bases means that they must be compensated for the costs associated with their children their basic wage is £ 66,000 and child benefit has now been axed for other working families earning more than £ 60,000			1
