the 22 - year - old , who had scored four times to lead his country to the quarter - finals , was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages of friday 's 2 - 1 win over @entity15 and taken to hospital			1
and team doctor @entity17 told local media in @entity0 that @entity2 will not kick another ball at the finals , expecting his recovery period to be at least four weeks			1
' it 's not serious in the sense that it does n't need surgery , but he 'll need to immobilize it to recover , ' he told @entity26			2
' unfortunately , he 's not going to be able to play			2
let 's wait for other tests			2
this is the first diagnosis we had			0
initially , we know he will not be able to play			0
’ @entity2 flew back to @entity72 from @entity73 with the rest of his team - mates following the match and was then transported by ambulance to the team 's training base at @entity51			1
the @entity57 forward had been struggling in the build - up to the all - @entity82 clash with thigh and knee strains but was passed fit to start			2
but he was carried off three minutes from the end after @entity52 's knee landed in his lower back leaving him in tears			1

let ’s wait for the examination and see if there is something in the next 48 hours that can be done			0
in my opinion it ’s going to be difficult			0
