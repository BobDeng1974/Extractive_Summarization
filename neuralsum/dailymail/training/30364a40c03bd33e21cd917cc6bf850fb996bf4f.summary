by @entity0 it started life 800 years ago as a humble ale jug , used to carry a refreshing pint or two into the countryside during the medieval harvest			1
left behind , perhaps by a farm hand who had drunk one too many , the jug lay undiscovered in the grounds of @entity11 until it was rediscovered in 1862			2
now , after another 150 years spent gathering dust in an attic , the jug is going to auction and is expected to fetch between £ 30,000 and £ 50,000			1
ancient history : the @entity15 was signed by @entity16 just five years before this jug was made the large glazed jug , described ' as one of the most important and early @entity20 relics of the potters art ever discovered ' , was originally made for use at @entity23 in @entity24 between 1220 and 1250			1
found : the glazed pottery was rediscovered in 1862 by a worker draining a field auctioneers speculate that it could have been used to carry cider or ale into the countryside to quench the thirst of workers who were gathering in the harvest			1
after being lost it was rediscovered in 1862 by a worker draining a field			0
at the time the vessel was kindly lent by the @entity39 lord @entity38 for exhibition in @entity41 and eventually inherited by a gentleman in @entity24 the exterior decoration shows horseshoe and buckle mouldings , the distinctive crests of the @entity48 family who used to live at the castle			1
it will go on sale at @entity52 in @entity24 on saturday 28 september			2
mr @entity53 , manager of the auction house , said : ' the early @entity56 jug is from the late norman period and would date to circa 1220			0
it really is a magical item			0
' ' when i initially assessed the jug i was informed the pet dog had on a couple of occasions come close to wagging its tail a little too close and knocking it over			0
' ' the family said it had then been stored in an attic before being discovered and put up for auction			2
' ' we hope collectors and museums will celebrate such a wonderful item			0
i really hope it is purchased by a museum and the public can enjoy it like we have at our auction centre			0

the horseshoe was the crest of the @entity48 who lived in @entity82 castle
the jug may have carried cider or ale for workers during harvest time
it recently spent 150 years in an attic before being put on sale
