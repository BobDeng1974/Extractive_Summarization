by @entity0 a vinyl cat has become an internet sensation after she was caught on video manipulating a record playing like a dj. two - year - old @entity7 was enticed to a record player by the sounds of @entity10 's is this love , which her owner @entity12 , 27 , had put on at home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
and once she had come face - to - face with the spinning record , she decided to take matters into her own paws by moving the record back and forth			0
however , her curiosity quickly gets the better of @entity32 , and she climbs onto the player , knocking the needle off and leaving her spinning round on the player			0
mr @entity12 managed to capture the moment on his phone 's camera			1
after uploading being uploaded to @entity41 the video amassed more than a million hits over three days			0
choosing her moment : @entity7 had never seen the record player before when she was tempted over by the sounds of is this love on top of the situation : @entity7 later abandoned her musical aspirations and took a ride on the record player spin me right round : @entity7 unfortunately knocked the needle away when she climbed on board , but has maintained a keen interest in music mr @entity12 said : ' i was just sitting around at home one day and put on a @entity10 record			1
@entity7 had never seen the record player in action before and took an immediate interest in it			1
' the video was a complete one off and there will be no attempt to do a follow up			0
i believe the best viral videos happen by chance			0
' ' after the video went viral , i played the music in the house regularly			2
she would run over to the computer every time she heard is this love so it 's safe to say she 's a big @entity10 fan			2

@entity7 , aged two , from @entity14 , @entity15 , was tempted by @entity10 song
she climbed over to decks and sped , slowed and scratched a record
video of her *exploits* by owner @entity12 , 27 , quickly went viral
