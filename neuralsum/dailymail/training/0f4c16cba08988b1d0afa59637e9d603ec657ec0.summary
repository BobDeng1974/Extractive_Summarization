@entity0 and @entity4 hooker @entity3 's latest @entity2 disciplinary hearing will take place in @entity6 on tuesday			1
@entity4 look set to mount a robust defence of their captain after he was sent off for elbowing @entity11 centre @entity9 in the face at @entity13 two days ago			1
in a statement , the @entity2 said : ' @entity3 ( @entity23 ) will have his case heard by an @entity2 disciplinary judicial officer on tuesday , december 23			1
' @entity3 was sent off in the @entity27 match between @entity23 and @entity11 for striking @entity9 with his elbow , contrary to @entity29 ( a )			1
' the case will be heard tomorrow evening in @entity6 by @entity31 sitting as a sole judicial officer at a time to be confirmed			0
' @entity3 ( right ) was adjudged to elbow @entity11 's @entity9 ( left ) before the pair had to be separated @entity3 cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue april 2007 : banned for 26 weeks after gouging @entity38 ' @entity37 and @entity40			1
march 2010 : claims of gouging versus @entity41 dropped when alleged victim , @entity44 , chose not to complain			0
march 2012 : banned for eight weeks for biting @entity46 flanker @entity45 during @entity47			0
june 2012 : sin - binned against @entity48 in first game as @entity0 captain			0
december 2012 : given a two - week ban for striking @entity53 's @entity52			1
may 2013 : eleven - week ban after being sent off for swearing			0
december 2014 : sent off for elbowing @entity11 's @entity9			1
@entity3 was handed a 26 - week ban for eye - gouging in 2007 , and an 11 - week suspension for verbally abusing referee @entity59 during the 2013 @entity27 final against @entity11			1
that latter ban led to him missing the @entity63 tour of @entity64 , and the @entity2 could easily take a dim view of his latest indiscretion			1
it happened after just 17 minutes of a titanic east midlands derby that @entity4 won 23 - 19			2
referee @entity69 initially seemed happy to award @entity3 a yellow card , but television match official @entity71 urged @entity69 to watch further replays , and he responded by sending 61 times - capped @entity3 off			2
' it was disappointing , ' @entity4 rugby director @entity73 said , speaking directly after the game			2
' @entity3 has got to keep his arms down , but he was being held and i do n't know there was any malice in it			2
' the nature of the game did n't justify a red card			0
i think @entity9 went down pretty easily , to be honest , which was disappointing			2
@entity85 touches down his second try during the 23 - 19 defeat at @entity4 on saturday @entity88 of @entity4 plays the ball out of the ruck as the @entity23 prevailed 23 - 19 winners @entity0 international @entity92 attempts to avoid the tackle of @entity94 on saturday afternoon ' it is a tough game			2
that 80 minutes of rugby was hard , physical with some great tackles , but i do n't think there was any malice in that			0
i think @entity102 's initial reaction of the yellow card would have been the correct decision			0
' @entity0 open their @entity47 campaign against @entity106 in @entity107 on february 6 , and given @entity3 's poor record - biting and punching offences also appear on his charge - sheet - another lengthy suspension appears likely			1
' it 's a tough game , and @entity3 plays to the edge			1
you would n't change @entity3			0
he is competitive , ' @entity73 added			0
' it is a difficult one			0
i think he should have kept his arms down - we are not saying that what he did was right - but what i am probably saying is that the opposition made it a lot easier , and a yellow card was sufficient .			0

@entity4 captain sent off for elbowing @entity11 's @entity9
@entity3 's continued disciplinary episodes mean @entity2 could ban the hooker
however his club will back him at a disciplinary hearing regardless
the @entity18 begins in february , which @entity3 could miss if banned
