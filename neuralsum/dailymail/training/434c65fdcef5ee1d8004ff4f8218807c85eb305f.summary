by @entity0 for @entity1 a postwoman left a cancer - stricken elderly man and his wife without their post for two weeks - because she refused to duck under their handing baskets to deliver it for them			1
@entity13 and @entity14 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , missed out on bank statements , an invitation and a letter from the hospital , all because the postwoman said it hurt her back to avoid the two large hanging baskets			1
until now they had received nothing but praise for their annual floral display , with photographs being used on calendars and postcards			1
she said : ' we could n't understand why we had n't any post for two weeks			1
my husband was outside the front tidying up and saw the postwoman			2
he said : " good morning my duck , we have n't had any letters for a while " and she said " no i am not delivering to you no more "			0
' she said it was damaging her back to get to the front door			2
they are tied in place securely at the front of the porch and if it was that much of a problem for her to get past she could have put them on the mat. ' we have always had big hanging baskets there and the postman and the postwoman we had before did not complain			0
' video courtesy of @entity71 bloomin ' heck ! the postwoman refused to deliver to the couple because their hanging baskets ' hurt her back ' beautiful display : the elderly couple had only ever received praise for the floral displays before the colourful baskets are full of trailing begonias and geraniums			1
and have always attracted a lot of attention			0
' until now we have had nothing but compliments about our hanging baskets and garden			0
people say it is a little ray of sunshine , ' said mrs @entity14 - who has four children , 12 grandchildren and one great - grandchild			1
' we have been doing the baskets for 30 years			0
a couple who had just got married knocked on the door and asked if they could have their pictures taken and one @entity103 lady was so taken with our garden she bought 60 postcards of @entity15 to send as @entity107 cards			2
' we do the garden and baskets together and it helps my husband who has been going through a very hard time with his chemo			0
' it 's not difficult ! mr @entity32 , 75 , who is undergoing chemotherapy , says he has no trouble getting to the front door mr @entity32 , who was disabled while serving in the army , added : ' we 're in our late 70s and duck , so i ca n't see why she ca n't do it			1
we have had bigger baskets than that in the past			0
the previous post lady used to just walk through			2
' the couple contacted the @entity129 consumer programme on @entity130			0
as a result , @entity131 sent a @entity134 investigator to the cottage and the deliveries have now been resumed			0
