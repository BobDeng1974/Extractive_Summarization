by @entity0 for @entity1 some may know @entity2 better as @entity3 from @entity4 , while others may have followed his journey from the @entity7 before the apathetic characters went viral on @entity9			1
but there was an unlikely catalyst that kick - started @entity2 's career and now he , his brother @entity13 and their friend @entity14 are pinned as some of @entity18 's most promising and innovative comedians and producers			1
in 2009 @entity2 , originally from @entity20 south of @entity21 , travelled to @entity22 for a holiday away from his @entity21 advertising job			1
what he did n't know was that he would bring back with him a rare and deadly disease			0
he spent 21 days in quarantine before he was released			2
but @entity2 received a phone call just weeks later , when one of his doctors broke the news that he actually contracted a drug - resistant form of the disease			1
back in the @entity21 hospital room where he would spent more than six months straight in quarantine , he had to find a way to amuse himself			1
in a bid to fill the long days spent mostly in isolation , @entity2 started making videos with the aid of his new laptop in a bid to entertain himself , and a handful of friends			1
from this , the @entity40 was born			0
' it was a bit of a fluke really - it was n't like getting @entity66 made me go " i want to make videos " , ' @entity2 told @entity1			1
@entity2 ( left ) , @entity14 ( right ) and @entity13 ( not pictured ) shot to fame after their @entity4 videos went viral the trio have garnered international fame and recently appeared in an advertisement for @entity75 @entity13 joined forces with his brother while he was in hospital and the pair began to produce videos together the above video can be viewed in full here			1
warning : it contains strong language			0
' at first i was just kind of really bored and dealing with what it was like to be confined ... they had me on a lot of medication which affected my attention span ' , he said			0
@entity2 filmed himself making an array of hilarious and touching videos from the confines of his hospital room - most of which revolved around his sickness			1
his doctor , @entity66 specialist dr @entity98 told @entity101 's @entity18 story it was inspiring to see someone deal with a potentially life - threatening illness in such a positive way			2
but dr @entity98 also revealed just how serious the disease was : ' it was clear from the state of @entity2 when he presented at the hospital that this was a fairly advanced case '			2
what started as a pass - time for @entity2 developed into hundreds of thousands of views from a growing online audience , despite the comedian 's initial refusal to engage with social media			0
what started as a pass - time for @entity2 developed into hundreds of thousands of views from a growing online audience @entity14 ( right ) teamed up with the brothers shortly after and the trio have a tv show on the way @entity2 's doctor dr @entity98 revealed just how serious his drug - resistant tb was by 2009 @entity127 had really taken off worldwide but @entity2 did n't want anything to do with it			1
' why would you want to watch your friends online - why not catch up with them ? ' he said			0
the irony that it was social media - where he has millions of views on @entity9 and close to 100,000 likes across various @entity127 pages - that really kickstarted @entity2 's career is not lost on him			2
fast forward through @entity2 's long recovery , which involved daily trips to the hospital for treatment for a full year after his release , the @entity13 - known then as the @entity142 - met @entity14			1
coming together over their shared @entity9 prominence the group decided to collaborate , and the gluten - free clean - living fashion - conscious @entity4 , originally just the @entity4 , were created			0
following the exploits of @entity3 , played by @entity2 , and @entity14 as @entity146 , @entity4 ' started off as a little left - jab at those @entity149 guys '			1
arguably their best - know @entity4 video @entity152 has raked in over a million views on @entity9 @entity14 , who portrays @entity154 in the comedy pieces , joined forced the with @entity2 brothers after meeting them at a @entity9 conference the group release regular videos and have a new one on the way at the end of this week the idea for @entity4 spawned from the contradictions they observed in people living in the area ' whenever you go out there 's lots of young kids out interested in environmentalist issue but they were n't changing their own lives ... ( they ) care about all the big things as long as they do n't affect their own lives ' , @entity2 elaborated			1
their most popular video is titled @entity152 , and highlights the contradictions they observed in people living a ' clean ' life in @entity149 while hitting up the party scene on the weekends			0
@entity2 's time in hospital also reignited the strong friendship between he and @entity13			1
' i would say my brother is my best friend ' , @entity2 said			2
on @entity195 just how strong the bond which emerged from his sibling 's illness was and said : ' i thought if i get it too ( @entity66 ) that 's okay at least i 'll be in there			0
and it was a bit of a self destructive instinct '			0
' i was fighting back tears watching that in the living room - i know he just wanted me to get better ' , @entity2 told @entity1			0
' it was a really emotional moment			0
' while @entity2 has become somewhat of a spokesperson for the group , he made sure it was known just how much work goes on behind the scenes and the hard yards @entity14 and @entity13 also put in			1
' i ca n't stress enough how much they are responsible for ' , he said			0
' and so much of this is owed to @entity13 , he 's a brilliant writer ' , @entity2 added			2
the trio 's latest venture is a tv show on @entity101 called soulmates , which tracks the friendship of two souls through the ages @entity3 and @entity146 are up for @entity220 , but the characters insist they would never enter themselves as it 's too mainstream their move to tv sees them jump from the computer screen to the small screen thanks to their immense popularity online the hard work has paid off for the trio and the they have made the jump from computer screens to the small screen			1
their new tv series title soulmates will air on @entity101 next month , and is loosely based on the character quirks and traits evident in the @entity4			2
it tracks two souls as they live their lives through different reincarnations , and despite the out - there graphics and crazy concepts @entity2 said reincarnation ' feels like a more possible concept than it used to '			0
the show is based on ' the idea if you 're in a reincarnating soul what happens from life to life ? is the idea of a soul mate ... is there a reason for that ? is it because they were someone else to you in another lifetime ? ' the boys are also keeping very busy making as much content as they can across all platforms and the @entity4 are set to release a new video at the end of this week taking on the financial system and the big ' bahnks '			2
@entity3 and @entity146 have also been nominated for @entity220 , and although they insist they did n't nominate themselves , @entity2 had other thoughts about that			0
' my opinion as @entity2 is that @entity3 entered himself , but pretended he did n't			0
' ' then @entity146 entered because @entity3 did ' , he laughed .			0
