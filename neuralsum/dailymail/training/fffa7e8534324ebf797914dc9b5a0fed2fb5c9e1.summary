by @entity0 in the land of @entity3 , contract killers are pretty cool customers			1
be it @entity7 's ultimate professional in @entity8 or @entity10 's slick everyman in @entity11 , film after book after video game has painted the hitman as a righteous ( if amoral ) dark avenger			1
but how close it that to reality ? when someone is gunned down , does the person pulling the trigger really fit this super-cool stereotype ? @entity23 , left , was a ' novice ' hitman , while @entity25 , right , was an experienced ' journeyman ' professor @entity26 , who led the team of criminologists who conducted the research for the new study this is the question asked and answered by a group of criminologists at @entity35			1
professor @entity26 , who led the team of four researchers , said : ' all these images are @entity39 - ised			1
the hitman seems like quite an attractive image that people are responding too			1
it ’s stylised , fetishized			1
they are all very professional , very competent , hyper masculine - but the reality is the 16 - year - old boy who is getting paid £ 200 and is very successful			1
' in the movies the hits usually take place in smokey bars and casinos but in reality they are taking place in the suburbs , in @entity55 when people are walking their dogs or are on their way back from the shops or a meal or the gym			1
the hits were not in the underworld , they were in the overworld and usually with passers by as witnesses looking on in abject horror			1
' the researchers pored over newspaper reports of contract kills , transcripts of court cases and conducted their own interviews with policeman , prison guards and convicted criminals			1
the study , published in the @entity78 , lays out a four category framework to explain the different types of people who become hitmen			1
the first type is the ' novice '			1
as the name suggests , this is someone at the beginning of their killing career , possibly having just picked up their first contract			1
professor @entity26 said : ' often the novice is much younger but they tend to come from an offending background			1
with the novice there is a sense that they are trying to establish themselves within a gang network and therefore will gain kudos from committing the hit			1
' @entity105 's @entity104 in the 2008 film in @entity107 is a good example of a novice			1
hiding out in the @entity111 town after his first hit went tragically wrong , @entity104 is wracked with guilt			2
despite having little similar experience behind him @entity104 had envisioned the start of a underworld career but inexperience and immaturity meant it was not to be			2
the character for hit tv show @entity123 never set out to kill anyone but faced with a life or death choice at the end of the show 's third series he feels forced into murdering a rival			2
feeling like he stumbled into such an act of violence , nothing is ever quite the same again			2
journeyman - 1997 's @entity11 saw @entity10 's @entity138 - operative turned hitman return to his hometown for a high school reunion			2
calm , collected and definitely not a man to be trifled with , @entity142 has carved himself a successful career in wet work but a slight reliance on luck stops him from stepping up to the next level			2
master - objective to a fault , ( almost ) nothing and no - one gets between the professional and his target			2
the film 's opening sequence shows how effective @entity8 can be and his strict rules , ruthless training regimen and under - the - radar lifestyle makes him the ultimate @entity3 assassin			2
professor @entity26 said : ' i 've never met a master hitman so i ca n't really say , but i certainly imagine that is the sort of world they would exist in '			2
the study flags up 16 - year - old @entity23 as an example of a novice			1
the teen shot @entity172 , 26 , in @entity173 in 2010 , in exchange for £ 200 - money he used to buy a fake @entity177 hat			2
the hit itself was successful but @entity23 was brought to justice because of his inability to stop bragging about what he had done			2
the second category is the ' dilettante '			0
this is the only type that can be considered to have ' fallen into being a hitman ' professor @entity26 explains			0
the dilettante is usually someone older , without a criminal background , who sees the quick fix money of a contract kill as their only way out of a crisis			0
professor @entity197 said : ' it ’s almost like they fell into becoming a hitman because someone offered them three grand to take out an ex-wife or a business rival			0
there is no sense therefore the dilitente wants to move through a hierarchy like the novice , they just want to overcome their crisis			0
' the dilettante example used by the study is @entity215 , a former legal clerk who accepted £ 5,000 in 1996 to kill @entity217 , 30 , in @entity173			1
however , @entity218 struck up a conversation with his intended victim and lost his nerve , unable to go through with the hit			0
due to their lack of criminal background , the dilettante is also the only type of hitman who is unlikely to be able to obtain a gun			0
category three is the ' journeyman ' - an experienced , reliable , career criminal			0
professor @entity26 said that while this type of hitman will often have completed a greater number of contracts than any of the others , it 's their connection to a specific area 's criminal underworld that leads to their downfall			0
he said : ' the journeyman hitman was often caught because of local intelligence , he was part of the community and often after he committed the hit , there was enough local intelligence that can be given to the police to bring them to justice			1
' the study 's example of a journeyman is the pairing of @entity25 and @entity258 in 2003			1
the duo executed @entity260 - a criminal who underworld bosses suspected had become a police informant			1
the hit itself was meticulous			0
they gunned @entity260 down as he came out of his gym and then fled the scene in a van , which they dumped and brunt before switching to another vehicle			0
however , one mistake brought it all crashing down			0
@entity258 left one of his gloves at the site of the vehicle switch , which gave police the evidence they needed to track the pair			1
the final category - the master - still has a level of mystery around it			0
for all their research , professor @entity26 and his team were not able to find any records of a master hitman being caught			0
they did , however , identify the gruesome work of such an operator			0
the killing of gangland boss @entity298 in @entity299 in 2000 is a master 's hit			0
@entity298 was assassinated with a sniper rifle outside his home while his son watched			0
professor @entity26 described it as ' the most professional hit committed in @entity307 '			0
as no master has ever been caught , it 's difficult for the researchers to draw up a complete profile of what this type of hitman might be like			0
professor @entity26 explained : ' you ca n’t really interview these people so it ’s difficult to build a psychological profile but it became pretty clear to us that with the journeyman and the masters had a paramilitary or military background which meant they could gain access to weapons , were comfortable around weapons and be able to dispose of evidence after the hit , so were forensically aware			0
' he is still trying to take his research further into the last two categories of hitman and is working with a group of phd students to do so but it 's slow going			0
' it is incredibly difficult because you just do n’t gain access to these people , ' he said .			0

the study has been done by criminologists at @entity35
they interviewed criminals , police and studied newspaper reports of hits
they have come up with a framework of four types of hitmen to explain who gets involved in the profession and why
