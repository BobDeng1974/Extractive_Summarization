the sight of a cabinet minister deep in discussion with police about the opening of the gates of @entity6 could cause panic at the highest levels of government			2
but far from a repeat of the @entity12 row which cost @entity13 his job , @entity15 – dubbed the ‘ politest man in politics ’ – is understood to have had a perfectly pleasant conversation with the officers			1
the @entity20 emerged from @entity21 to find his car had been locked out by the closure of the gates , which mr @entity13 famously demanded be opened so he could ride his bicycle through them			0
questions : education secretary @entity15 was seen asking armed police why his car could not pick him up in @entity6 aides stressed that mr @entity15 is one of the politest men in politics and did not have a cross word to say about the officers mr @entity15 had been @entity21 helping @entity34 to prepare for prime minister ’s questions			1
but mr @entity34 left before him , and any movement involving the prime minister leads to @entity6 being placed into a security lockdown			1
it meant that mr @entity15 ’s ministerial car could not meet him at the door to @entity21 , so the @entity44 minister walked down to speak to police to find out what was going on			2
despite the animated expression in some of the photographs , aides insist it was an amicable conversation			0
‘ he is the politest man in politics			0
any suggestion of cross words could not be further from the truth , ' said a source			0
on foot : the @entity20 had expected to find his car waiting for him after prepping @entity34 for prime minister 's questions @entity13 resigned as chief whip for swearing in @entity6 when police would not let him ride his bike through the @entity6 gates if only mr @entity13 had taken the same approach			1
one evening in september 2011 he tried to ride his bike through the main gates , but was told by officers to dismount and use a side gate			0
he admits losing his temper and swearing , saying : ‘ i thought you guys were supposed to f * * * ing help us ’			2
the foul - mouthed outburst eventually cost him his @entity76 job as chief whip			0
however , he denies a claim made in an official police log that he called the officers ‘ f * * * ing plebs ’ – a dispute which has led to legal and disciplinary action being taken against some of the officers involved .			1

education secretary *surprised* to find his car not waiting for him
he had been *briefing* @entity34 ahead of prime minister 's questions
@entity6 was in lockdown and the ministerial car was *barred*
but no cross words for officers from the ' politest man in politics '
@entity13 quit after telling police ' you *'re* supposed to f * * * ing help us '
