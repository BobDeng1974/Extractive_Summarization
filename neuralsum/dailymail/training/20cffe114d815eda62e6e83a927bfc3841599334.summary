human evolution was driven by short , rapid waves of climate change			1
this is according to researchers studying cone - shaped deposits of sediment in southeast @entity7 that provide a 160,000 year record of the area 's climate			1
the deposits reveal that our early human ancestors left @entity14 on a journey to southern @entity16 around 75,000 to 130,000 years ago , during multiple phases			1
human evolution may have been driven by short , rapid waves of climate @entity20 is according to researchers studying cone - shaped deposits of sediment from southeast @entity7 that provide a 160,000 year record of the area 's climate			1

a person circled for scale the find contradicts another theory that claims human populations expanded rapidly from @entity14 to southern @entity16 via the coastlines of @entity7 around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago			1
the sediments reveal a period of increased rainfall , which scientists at @entity39 argue would have provided sufficient freshwater to support expanding populations			1
' the dispersal of early human populations out of @entity14 is dynamically linked with the changing climate and environmental conditions of @entity7 , ' said professor @entity46 at @entity39			2
' although now arid , at times the vast @entity48 deserts were transformed into landscapes littered with freshwater lakes and active river systems			0
the sediments – also known as alluvial fans - were found along the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56			2
pictured is a stock image of alluvial fan deposits ' such episodes of dramatically increased rainfall were the result of the intensification and northward displacement of the @entity65 , which caused rainfall to reach across much of the @entity7			2
' the sediments – also known as alluvial fans - were found along the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56			2
a previous study by @entity69 argued that the waxing and waning of huge lakes in the @entity73 was linked to the brain expansion of early human species			0
professor @entity76 , co-author of the study , said at the time : ' it seems modern humans were born from climate change			0
' they had to deal with rapid switching from famine to feast - and back again - which drove the appearance of new species with bigger brains and also pushed them out of @entity14 into @entity89 and @entity90			0
' pictured is a partial human skull excavated from a cave in @entity96 's western @entity95 region			0
it has been described as the first fossil remains that appear to document our ancestor 's journey out of @entity14 long ago , humans left their evolutionary cradle in @entity14 and passed through the @entity104 on their way to @entity106			1
and in january , scientists found the first fossil remains that appear to document that journey , a partial skull from an @entity96 cave			0
the skull dates from around 55,000 years ago , fitting into the period when scientists had thought the migrants inhabited the area			1
and details of its anatomy resemble ancient skulls from @entity106 , @entity118 of @entity119 in @entity96 wrote in an email			0
the skull , which lacks facial features and its base , was found in @entity123 in the @entity95 region of northern @entity96			0
the migrants are called modern humans because of their anatomy			0
the earliest remains of modern humans in @entity106 date to about 45,000 years ago .			1

researchers made discovery after analysing sediment from @entity56
these sediments provided a 160,000 year record of area 's climate
deposits reveal our ancestors left @entity14 75,000 to 130,000 years ago
they did so in multiple phases as a result of rapid bursts of rainfall
this contradicts theory they left all at once around 50,000 years ago
