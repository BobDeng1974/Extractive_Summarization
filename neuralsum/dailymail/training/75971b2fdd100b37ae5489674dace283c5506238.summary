originally from @entity10 , @entity11 , he had seen the suffering first hand during a life - changing visit to a refugee camp , which inspired him to help the innocents whose lives were being wrecked by the conflict			1
after volunteering with a @entity21 charity , the 47 - year - old married father - of - two agreed to drive 3,000 miles in a convoy of old ambulances to help the aid effort and take much - needed medical supplies to hospitals in the northern @entity6 province of @entity28			1
he travelled with eight others from charity @entity43 , who intended to deliver vital equipment , including @entity47 ambulances packed with baby milk , nappies , food and defibrillators , but was kidnapped by @entity53 extremists on @entity54 , shortly after making the 4,000 - mile journey to the town of @entity57			1
footage emerged three weeks ago of the keen fisherman looking ill and exhausted as he knelt before the knife - wielding militant nicknamed @entity61 at the end of the chilling video of the barbaric murder of aid worker @entity65			1
last night the terrorist ’s threat that mr @entity0 would become the next @entity2 hostage to be killed if @entity69 persisted ' in fighting the @entity53 ' appeared to have been carried out			1
his death comes just two days after his wife of 23 years @entity72 , 45 , appeared on camera to make a heart - breaking plea to his captors to spare his life			2
tearfully , she said mr @entity0 , 47 , was ' in the right place , doing the right thing ' when he travelled to @entity6 to deliver aid			1

neighbours living near his family 's red - brick terrace house in @entity103 , @entity11 , where the couple had lived for a decade , covered their community with yellow ribbons in a show of support for mr @entity0 , his wife and their children @entity110 , 17 , and @entity113 , 15			2
‘ @entity115 ’ ribbons were attached to cars , gates and lampposts and more than 100 friends and well - wishers attended a vigil for all faiths last week to pray for his safe return			0
@entity21 leaders across the globe also urged the @entity127 terrorists to show mercy to mr @entity0 , who was ' an ordinary guy just trying to help women and kids			1
’ they said killing mr @entity0 is against shariah law and would be the ' worst condemnable sin ' against @entity127			2
a fan of @entity135 , which he enjoyed playing as he drove , mr @entity0 was incredibly popular and during one trip insisted on sleeping inside his ambulance instead of a hotel to save money so it could be donated to the refugees instead			1
mr @entity0 's death comes just two days after his wife @entity143 , pictured , made a tearful plea to his captors to release him @entity147 documentary maker @entity145 , who met mr @entity0 when he was packing an aid convoy bound for @entity6 , said he had no formal background in aid work , but felt a ' pull ' to return to @entity6 after a previous trip to a refugee camp			1
' he was a funny man and was cracking jokes while we were packing up , ' ms @entity145 said			0
' he told me that he 'd been on one of those convoys previously and he was inspired by his friends who 'd been , and since he 'd got back he 'd found it hard not to return			2
' he 's a taxi driver , not a professional aid worker - but he said he looked at the world differently [ after he returned ] and felt a pull to go back to @entity6			2
' he was very popular and friends would comment that he was very funny and very kind			0
' he described holding the children ... and how that really affected him			0
he told me he had to go back			0
' last week people held a candlelit vigil for mr @entity0 near his home in @entity169 , @entity11 ‘ @entity115 ’ yellow ribbons were also attached to cars , gates and lampposts as a show of support for mr @entity0 's family @entity177 , leader of the convoy on which mr @entity0 was travelling when he was kidnapped , described his friend as a ‘ big softie			1
’ dr @entity181 , who was also in the convoy , said mr @entity0 was ‘ remarkable			1
’ ‘ he ’s such a compassionate and selfless human being , ’ she said			0
‘ it just simply was n’t enough for @entity115 to sit back and just donate or raise awareness			0
he had to get up and do something about what he ’d seen every time the convoys went he had a yearning to go			0
that really motivated him , to see , practically , first - hand the difference he was making			0
’ but after the @entity191 announced that @entity192 had attacked is targets inside @entity194 – many feared a backlash against mr @entity0			2
relatives and colleagues said they feared air strikes would make it harder for him to be found alive			0
last night it appeared their worst fears had been realised			0
@entity203 , from @entity204 , who worked with mr @entity0 in @entity6 said he appeared to have been ' abandoned ' to his fate by the government and the decision to join @entity209 - led airstrikes may have ' sealed his fate '			1
' we have been pressuring the government into doing something to secure his release but they abandoned him			0
the @entity2 government left him out there , ' he told @entity216 's today			2
' @entity217 managed to release 49 hostages without paying a single penny			0
the @entity2 government all they had to do was release one hostage			2
' the longer - than - previous delay after a video threat to kill mr @entity0 had suggested they were at least open to sparing him , mr @entity203 told today			1
' however the government have done nothing at all to help his case			0
if anything , they voted for air strikes which may have sealed his fate			0
