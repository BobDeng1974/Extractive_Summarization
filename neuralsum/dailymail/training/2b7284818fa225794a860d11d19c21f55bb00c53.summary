where exactly have tourists been warned they can not go ? the latest advice for tourists is to avoid all but essential travel to @entity148 and within 5km of the coast from @entity151 creek , north of the city , and @entity153 in the south			0
however , the warning does not include the popular beach resort of @entity157 or @entity60 , which is the gateway to the coast			0
i have a holiday booked on @entity7 ’s coast , will it be cancelled ? tour operators will cancel any holidays that are based in the areas that have now been declared off - limits			2
they are not obliged to cancel trips to other parts of @entity7			2
however , some companies , such as @entity90 and @entity92 , have also evacuated holidaymakers from @entity157 , which is not included in the latest advice			2
therefore it is advisable to contact your holiday company to see what its policy is			0
my holiday has been cancelled , what are my rights ? rest assured , if you have booked through a tour operator you are entitled to a full refund or you will be offered an alternative trip			0
customers who have booked flights and accommodation separately should expect to be refunded as long as their accommodation is if you have booked your trip independently and have travel insurance it should pay out for any trips cancelled due to changing travel advice			2
always make sure you check your policy @entity197 am booked for a safari holiday and am not going near the south coast , will my trip still go ahead ? tour operators offering trips to areas that are not affected by the latest travel update will go ahead as @entity204 if i have a holiday to @entity7 booked but do n’t want to go following this news ? unless your trip is to one of the affected areas which tourists have been advised to avoid then your booking still stands			1
companies in general will not allow customers to cancel bookings to other parts of the country which are still considered safe according to government @entity217 is considered safe ? almost all of the rest of @entity7 , including popular safari areas , is considered safe			2
the only new areas tourists have been told to avoid are @entity38 island and within 5km of the coast from @entity151 creek in the north down to and including @entity153 in the south			0
long - standing advice about non-essential travel includes areas within 37 miles of the @entity7 – @entity233 border , @entity231 and coastal areas north of @entity234 ( in the south east of the country ) , the @entity238 ( in the east ) , the @entity236 area of @entity33 and the slum areas of the @entity7 capital .			2
