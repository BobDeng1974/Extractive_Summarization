we all know that a good workout helps us relax			0
now scientists have worked out why			0
it seems that well - honed muscles stop a stress chemical from reaching the brain			1
the muscles filter out the dangerous substance , much like the liver removes poisons from the body			1
the finding does n’t just help explain why exercising makes us feel less stressed – it could also lead to new treatments for depression			2
after five weeks of this , the normal mice showed signs of depression , including loss of appetite			2
however , the second group of @entity37 mice remained healthy			0
these mice had genes that meant they were muscly , even without exercising			0
further tests showed what is magical about muscle			0
@entity45 mice make more of protective proteins called @entity47			1
these stop a stress chemical called kynurenine from travelling to the brain			1
the researchers from @entity53 ’s @entity52 showed that normal mice quickly become depressed when given kynurenine			2
but muscly mice were immune to the chemical			2
in fact , the amount of kynurenine in their blood never rose because the @entity62 in their bulging muscles quickly neutralised it			1
other experiments showed that normal mice made more of the protective @entity47 after regularly running on their wheel			1
importantly , people also made more @entity68 after just a few weeks of exercise			0
researcher @entity70 said that by detoxifying the blood , muscle protects the brain said : ‘ well - trained muscle produces an enzyme that purges the body of harmful substances			1
experts said the findings pave the way for better treatments for depression , as drugs that work on the muscles rather than the brain should have fewer side effects ‘ the muscle ’s function is reminiscent of the kidney or liver			1
’ writing in the journal @entity91 , dr @entity70 said the discovery paves the way for new and better treatments for depression , which affects up to one in five @entity97 as some point in their life			0
drugs that that works on the muscles , rather than the brain , should produce fewer side - effects			1
dr @entity70 said : ‘ @entity104 is a debilitating condition with a profound impact on quality of life for millions of people worldwide			0
‘ @entity104 is one the world ’s leading causes of disease burden and time lived with disability and current anti-depressant treatments are insufficient			0
‘ our work suggests that there is great therapeutic potential … in harnessing one of the many beneficial effects of exercise			0

well - honed muscles make more of protective proteins called @entity47
these stop a stress chemical called kynurenine from reaching the brain
normally , exposure to the stress chemical kynurenine causes depression
drugs working on the muscles not brain would have fewer side effects
