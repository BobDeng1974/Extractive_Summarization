by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 14:09 est , 29 june 2012 @entity1 is a cold - blooded assassin who has been waiting in the shadows since vanishing more than five years ago			1
but now @entity3 has returned			2
a dish best served cold and he 's been fine - tuning his recipe			1
hounded by the police , 47 finds himself in the middle of a dark conspiracy			2
he must embark on a journey through a corrupt and twisted world , in his quest for the truth			0
hidden warrior : agent 47 carefully lines up his target from an apartment window what the @entity21 franchise does is deliver choice			0
you could walk up in the street and blast the target			0
take him out from distance			0
or , in true silent assassin fashion , set up certain booby traps and make the guy 's death look like an accident			0
hitman : blood money was brilliant , but @entity36 will be worth the wait			0
it has been built from the ground up , boasting a cinematic story , distinctive art direction and highly original game design			1
it combines much - loved classic gameplay with completely new features for the franchise			1
the @entity48 engine is a remarkable piece of precise engineering - squeezing the last drop of power from the aging consoles and providing a visual tour - de - force on high - end @entity55 everything has a sort of ‘ @entity59 sheen ’			1
from the dank , dark suburbs teeming with intricate details , to the vast , sun - kissed vistas which stretch draw distance to its limit			1
the man himself is brilliantly detailed , too – his wrinkles and realistic skin are a far cry from the slightly cartoon - like 47 of the past			1
wonderful animations enforce the idea that 47 is a living , breathing man , who although skilled – is not quite invincible			0
hit in the making : if being quiet is not your thing , you can run in all guns blazing absolution has much more depth than before			0
one addition is ‘ instinct mode ’			1
this will let 47 predict enemy patrols – think @entity88 : @entity89 spliced with @entity90 : conviction			0
this is optional so it wo n’t dictate the way you play			0
however , similar to @entity90 , if things get too hectic , you ’ll be able to mark and slow - motion execute targets			1
this is a refreshing move as ‘ open ’ combat in the previous hitman games was n’t quite as solid as it should have been			0
in @entity103 , it was almost impossible to avoid the tendency to restart the level if a hit went wrong			1
the player was often swarmed by ( not - too - bright ) @entity109 guards who would bound gleefully into the path of a rapid - firing machine gun – resulting in a mini massacre			1
absolution also has a lovely touch , where , if you get too close to an enemy , the camera slows down – and you ’ll see the guy double - take you			2
tense moments : agent 47 must slip past these cops they also have memory , so do n’t expect to take a guy out when someone ’s back is turned , for them to turn around and not realise ‘ that engineer ’ now looks nothing like the guy who was there a second ago			2
surprisingly , the developer has said that only 20 per cent of @entity36 's players will see the game 's ending			1
speaking to @entity138 , @entity136 , game director for @entity137 , said : ' we are using metrics a lot more now than we did , for good and for bad			2
the general player will probably never even finish the game , which is very sad			2
or they might only play through it once			0
' but the game is built for the people who want to go back through every single level and get all the stuff out of it			1
it ’s built to last , rather than be a one - off experience			2
' he added : ‘ ( @entity36 ) is both a familiar and yet significantly different experience to any of the other @entity21 games , something our silent assassins will relish as well as those who are new to the @entity21 world			0
’ follow @entity0 on @entity161 : @ @entity162			0

developer says just 20 per cent of players will see last level
' instinct mode ' lets you see through walls and mark targets
@entity109 ' memory ' makes *fooling* in - game characters toughest *challenge* yet
