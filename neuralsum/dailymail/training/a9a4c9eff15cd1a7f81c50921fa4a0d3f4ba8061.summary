what did you eat for breakfast this morning ? tea and toast ? coffee and cereal ? i do n’t mean to sound smug , but here ’s what i had : alfalfa , spinach , wheatgrass , pineapple , apple , goji berry , beetroot , broccoli , some ‘ alkalising super greens ’ , and , er some maitake mushroom ; all on top of my cereal			2
thankfully , i was n’t chopping for hours : all these mega-healthy ingredients came in a magical powder form , ready for me to sprinkle on my @entity24			1
the @entity40 model , who somehow turned 50 in march , launched this green powder — marketed as @entity43 — last month , with the help of @entity46 nutritionist dr @entity45			1
containing 45 ingredients , it is meant to improve ‘ inner fitness , support nutrition at a cellular level and optimise the functioning of all 11 systems of the body			1
’ frankly , at this price — £ 96 a jar , which should last just one month — i ’d expect it to make me fly			1
but it seems the days of good old - fashioned multi-vitamins are long gone ; today ’s supplements are as a-list as the people raving about them — with price tags to match			2
the body : @entity40 supermodel @entity29 turned 50 in march earlier this month , @entity65 tweeted a picture of her new favourite supplement : @entity68 , which combines raw honey , pollen , propolis and royal jelly to boost energy , fight acne and help with indigestion , depression and high blood pressure			1
it also costs an eye - watering £ 35 for a small pot , which even its biggest fan would have to admit wo n’t last long			1
meanwhile , other celebrities such as @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 have been waxing lyrical about breakfast smoothies made with a bewildering number of new - age ingredients , including maca powder , chia seeds , blue algae , baobab powder , bee pollen , freeze - dried acai berry and lacuma powder			1
each one is supposed to be an ancient superfood , offering a vast array of benefits , from boosting your libido to warding off depression			2
but as they cost anything from £ 5 to £ 20 a pop , by my reckoning , you ’d have to shell out £ 70 before you could get your blender out			2
even @entity109 sells dr @entity111 ’s total skin and body supplements — £ 78 for a month ’s worth , or for those on the budget , superberry powder with acai , at £ 53 for 30 days ’ worth			1
just like jeans and handbags , vitamins , it seems , have gone designer			2
but are super-supplements worth their super prices ? ‘ part of the allure of some of these products is the price tag			2
it ’s like buying a @entity131 candle or a pot of @entity133 — you do n’t need to spend £ 100 on a face cream , but some people want to and swear by it , ’ says nutritionist @entity137			1
‘ most of these new supplements are what ’s known as “ food state nutrients ” , which are as similar to real food as possible			0
because they are better absorbed by the gut , you could say you get more benefit from them , but then you could also benefit from eating a lot of vegetables , ’ says @entity148 has a problem with the main claim of @entity29 ’s new product : that it alkalises the body			1
the theory goes that modern diets create too much acid , leading to an over-production of fat cells to carry the excess away from vital organs ; as well as exacerbating many common complaints such as arthritis and tiredness			0
health wealth : super-supplements are supposed to be an ancient superfood , offering a vast array of benefits , but may make your purse significantly lighter breakfast boost : @entity27 channeled the celebrity vibe and tried out several super-supplements the idea is that eating certain foods or supplements can maintain the body ’s ideal ph balance ( acidity levels ) to improve overall health			1
‘ i ’m not comfortable with the science , ’ says @entity137			0
‘ there ’s no robust research to show you change your body ’s @entity184 through food for more than a minute or two			0
we all like to think that there ’s a health secret that we have n’t been let into — and @entity191 is sharing it with us			0
’ and what about the new array of products such as maca or lucuma powder ? sales of vitamins and dietary supplements are expected to reach £ 786 million by 2018 ‘ it ’s funny , we embrace technology in every area of our lives but still think , health wise , that something from an ancient tribe is better , ’ says @entity137			1
‘ the specifics are fine — they contain concentrated forms of antioxidants and flavonoids , which are extremely useful , but we do n’t know the long - term safety			2
‘ also , putting a spoon of this , a spoon of that into a smoothie is working on the assumption that the body is going to benefit from a mega dose of nutrients			0
whereas we do n’t know if our body is even able to absorb them all			0
’ @entity137 is , however , a fan of freshly made green vegetable juice — and says if we up our ‘ five - a - day ’ to at least seven , we will be fine			1
‘ i do n’t like the idea that food is n’t enough , ’ he says			0
‘ a good diet of fruit and vegetables will be enough for the vast majority of us			0
salad days : the @entity28 contains 45 different vegetables , but one expert says it would be better for us to eat the vegetables directly ‘ and if you ’re feeling below par , think : are you stressed ? are you drinking too much ? not sleeping enough ? an expensive supplement is n’t the answer			1
’ oh well , even if @entity191 ’s power powder does n’t give me the body of @entity29 , it has at least made me a few pounds lighter			1
@entity244 : made from a @entity246 root , purported to boost energy and sex drive			0
@entity249 : the @entity251 superfood is said to increase energy			0
@entity253 : made from @entity255 lucuma fruit and aids digestion			0
@entity257 : packed full of 22 amino acids , vitamins and minerals			0
@entity261 berries : @entity262 in anti-oxidants ; linked to weight loss			0
@entity265 : meant to help dieters lose weight by making you feel fuller			0
@entity270 / @entity269 / kelp : @entity272 packed with protein , vitamins and minerals , to boost energy and mood			0
@entity278 : @entity262 in vitamin c and good for immune system			2

@entity27 tried out @entity29 's new vitamin powder ' @entity43 '
containing 45 uber - healthy ingredients , it costs £ 96 a jar
@entity65 and @entity84 swear by super-supplements
however , one expert says we *'d* be better off upping our five - a - day to seven
