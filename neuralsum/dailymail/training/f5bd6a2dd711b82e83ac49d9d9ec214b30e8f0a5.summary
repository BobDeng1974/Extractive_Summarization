' according to studies , the phenomenon of surprise birth is not as rare as one might imagine			1
previously , statistics show that one in 600 mothers - to - be will be unaware they are pregnant until they give birth , or just before			1
the situation tends to occur in busy women , those who may already be overweight , and those approaching the menopause			0
it tends to happen in menopausal women and younger busy women because they are not expecting to be pregnant and will not be looking for signs also , bleeding during pregnancy is common , especially during the first few months when the baby is bedding in , so women can think they are still menstruating			1
