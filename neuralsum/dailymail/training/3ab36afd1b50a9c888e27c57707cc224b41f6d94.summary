by @entity0 published : 14:48 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 3 december 2012 established under the reign of @entity4 @entity3 , @entity1 has hosted some of the finest players the sport has ever created			1
the late @entity8 and @entity9 are among many world - class champions invited to play on the meandering fairways in south - west @entity13			2
former cabinet secretary @entity15 and popular tv hosts @entity16 – @entity17 and @entity18 – are reportedly on the waiting list to join the prestigious club			2
clash on course : members of queen victoria @entity1 want to oust a club champion whom they accuse of swearing and cheating but now a bitter dispute over unsporting behaviour on the fairways and inappropriate language within earshot of the wood - panelled bar has begun to overshadow the usually tranquil atmosphere			1
some of the club ’s 800 members , which include rich businessmen , senior policemen and television presenters , have threatened to leave unless a club champion is ‘ thrown out on his ear ’ for alleged cheating			1
and the star player ’s alleged use of bad language has been cited as evidence that the middle - aged player has no place at the exclusive club			1
disgruntled members have launched a campaign to oust the champion accusing him of being a foul - mouthed cheat			1
allegations against the star , who plays off a low handicap , stretch back several years , it is claimed in an anonymous email circulated around the club members			2
foul play : the champion golfer has been accused in an anonymous email sent to members ( file photo ) his accuser says was ‘ caught red handed ’ cheating in an annual competition			1
when he was suspended from the club the man is said to have involved the @entity69 to get his title restored			2
however his detractors claim they have been forced to act following an alleged incident at the annual club knock - out competition this autumn , he is he alleged to have pocketed an opponent ’s lost ball while pretending to look for it			2
the email claims the player , who has won a number of club championships , has cheated before – kicking his own ball out of the rough , and ‘ flipping his marker two feet nearer the hole ’			1
his dog has also been accused of sharp practice – allegedly stealing a lady member ’s ball from a green			1
the star player allegedly told the woman to ‘ get a f * * * * * * life ’ when she complained			1
the email continued ; ‘ his loud swearing , particularly in the men ’s changing room is also a problem ’			0
the star player is said to have ‘ refused to go ’ when he was challenged about the allegations			1
famous player : @entity101 pro @entity9 is a fan of the prestigious @entity102 but to the growing annoyance of the email writer , it is he who has been asked to leave the club and not his nemesis – the alleged foul - mouth cheat			1
the club captain @entity110 has now written to members appealing for calm and criticising their ‘ presumption of guilt ’			0
mr @entity110 wrote : ‘ various notices on the board of the clubhouse have also been defaced with the word “ cheat ”			0
‘ such behaviour is shocking and i would ask members to remind themselves of the proper ethical and legal traditions that underlie the culture of our club and the legal system of our country			0
’ however critics of the star player have refused to be cowed			1
one reportedly said : ‘ this is n’t about one member disagreeing with another			0
there ’s a lot of us who have complained about cheating			2
‘ one member has already threatened to resign and i think many will go if he is allowed to stay on this time			0
‘ his behaviour is not just damaging the club ’s reputation but golf as a whole			0
’ the star player declined to offer comment when approached by the @entity145 today			2
un-fairway : the unidentified man 's accusers say he has cheated during club tournaments and demand that he is thrown out ( file photo ) speaking on the drive of his £ 1 million home in south @entity13 said : ‘ thank you , but no comment			0
’ asked to give his version of events , he replied ; ‘ no comment			0
’ however last night two club members who have played with the champion described him as a ‘ decent bloke ’			0
@entity164 , 78 , a retired lecturer at @entity165 and former golf club board member , told the @entity145 : ‘ i have played him a number of times and i have always found him to be a total gentleman , a really decent bloke			0
‘ he is a very good sportsman , one of the club ’s best players			0
’ mr @entity164 added : ‘ this whole business really should have been sorted out before it got this far			0
’ his son @entity173 , who is also a member of @entity1 , said : ‘ he has always been very pleasant			1
’ last night no one from the board of @entity1 replied to messages left by the @entity145			1
but the club is reported to have said : ‘ the matter is subject of an inquiry and we have no comment to make at present			0
’ set in grounds next to the @entity184 and created in 1898 @entity182 claims its course is one of the best in the @entity187 .			0
