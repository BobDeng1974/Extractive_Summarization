by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 19:33 est , 14 march 2013 intrusive : judge @entity1 condemned @entity3 council for its heavy - handed approach to the abuse case a mother told of her nightmare yesterday after being secretly investigated for child abuse by social workers who received a single , anonymous letter			1
the woman was left ‘ terrified ’ that her six - year - old daughter would be removed in the probe by @entity3 – the authority at the centre of the @entity17 scandal			2
after winning a ‘ landmark ’ case yesterday , she also spoke of her anger that the local authority had sought to avoid being named in the affair to prevent further public embarrassment			0
officials had obtained three mobile numbers and a landline phone number for the family after contacting the girl ’s school without her parents ’ knowledge			1
the mother – who works as a social worker – said she was ‘ horrified ’ when a student social worker later contacted the couple to belatedly reveal they were investigating allegations of mistreatment			2
yesterday a high court judge condemned @entity3 for its ‘ knee - jerk reaction ’ to the unsigned letter , which was riddled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors			2
this included approaching the child ’s gp and her school to ask for any signs of ‘ emotional and physical abuse ’ of the child before they had spoken to her parents			1
pay out : the parents of a young girl have won @entity54 damages over an ' unlawful ' decision by social services to investigate whether their child was being ill - treated or was at risk of suffering significant harm judge @entity1 said the child was never at risk of harm from her middle class parents , who had never been in trouble with police or had previous contact with social services			1
he quashed the ‘ unlawful ’ decision to start the investigation and ordered the council to pay £ 2,000 compensation to the couple and legal costs expected to run to tens of thousands of pounds			0
after the hearing , the girl ’s mother urged the government to step in to sort out @entity3 ’s beleaguered child protection department			1
she expressed fears that while the council squandered taxpayers ’ cash investigating spurious complaints it risked overlooking genuine cases			0
she said : ‘ this has been a dreadful ordeal that has taken a huge emotional and financial strain on my family			0
although i knew it was groundless , i was terrified they would take my child away			0
‘ we were accused of smacking our child			0
as it happens , we do n’t smack , but if the council starts investigating all parents who occasionally smack their child to discipline them , they would end up looking at 90 per cent of families in the borough			2
’ the woman and her partner are both experienced social workers and so knew the council ’s reaction was excessive			1
decision : a judge ruled there was no basis on which the @entity110 of @entity3 's social workers should have started the inquiry			1
@entity3 council building is pictured tragic : haringey council has faced devastating criticism in the past over the @entity17 , pictured , and @entity118 cases gone : the former director of children 's services at @entity123 's @entity3 council @entity17 is pictured they brought a legal challenge to the council ’s decision to investigate them under @entity128 of the @entity129 , which the judge described as an ‘ intrusive ’ assessment of a child and her parents to determine if she was being harmed			1
the mother said : ‘ because we know the system we had the courage to stand up to the council and take it this far , but i pity the many other parents who are n’t able to do this and have to suffer in silence			0
this is the first time that a section 47 investigation has been successfully challenged and overturned			0
’ the council launched the investigation after its ‘ social services child abuse department ’ received the unsigned letter dated march 2011 from someone claiming to be a neighbour of the family saying he was worried about the child			1
the judge ruled that approaching the gp and school without seeking the parent ’s permission was ‘ erroneous ’			1
he said : ‘ these were serious departures from permissible practice and these actions were unlawful			0
’ the child was not at risk of significant harm and it ... was highly likely the anonymous referral was malicious			0
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ our handling of this case fell below the standards that we would expect , and we apologise to the family concerned			2

@entity174 said @entity3 's social workers should not have investigated
they approached child ’s gp and her school without parents ' permission
child ’s mother said her family had gone through ' a nightmare '
