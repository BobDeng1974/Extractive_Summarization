by @entity0 @entity1 has finally succeeded in taking the pressure off herself at a grand slam and is two matches away from a third successive @entity6 title			1
the world number one had a sensational season in 2013 , winning 78 matches and losing just four , but two of those defeats came unexpectedly at grand slams			2
@entity1 ' phenomenal success everywhere else made up for it but this season underperforming at slams has become a trend			1
relaxed : @entity1 believes she can play without pressure as she aims to retain her @entity6 title she was beaten in the fourth round at the @entity21 by @entity22 , slumped to a miserable defeat against @entity24 in the second round of the @entity26 and then went out in the third round at @entity28 to @entity29			1
the common thread was how tight and nervous @entity1 looked , the pressure both internal and external clearly a major hindrance			1
the @entity6 is the 32 - year - old 's last chance this season to get to 18 slam singles titles , the same mark as @entity39 and @entity40			1
determined : @entity1 is after a third successive @entity6 title having struggled in the @entity42 this season agitated : the @entity43 has appeared to shows signs of pressure this year as she chases an 18th @entity42 champion : @entity1 is the reigning champion at @entity47 and already has five @entity6 titles @entity1 said with a laugh that the number 18 meant ' legal and legendary ' to her , and she revealed seeing the funny side of this season had helped her relax			1
' it 's so easy now because it 's almost a joke for me because i have done little to no winning in the majors , ' she said			2
' and i thought , " take it as a joke			2
oh my @entity59 , i 'm past the fourth round			2
i better play doubles just in case i do n't make it past the second round			0
at least i have a back - up plan			2
' @entity1 has stayed cool and projected an air of control throughout her five matches so far , never dropping more than three games in any set			1
against @entity73 in the quarter - finals she was 3 - 0 down but responded with a run of six games in a row			2
challenger : 17th seed @entity81 , in her first singles semi-final at a slam , is @entity1 ' opponent in the last four she meets another player yet to drop a set , @entity86 @entity81			1
the 17th seed , who is into her first singles semi-final at a slam , has the distinction of being the only left - hander to beat @entity1 at a major			1
that was in @entity93 in 2012 , but @entity81 has already tasted victory over her opponent this tournament in doubles , and she and fellow @entity86 @entity98 are through to the women 's doubles final			1
@entity1 has won their other three singles meetings , including in @entity103 earlier this year , and is looking forward to the challenge			1
she said : ' i have played two lefties already and i often practice with ( fellow @entity43 ) @entity107 ( @entity107 )			1
i think that 's been good for me , so i 'm ready for the lefty			0
' i think it will be a good match			0
she 's beaten me before			0
i am obviously going to go in there and just try to do the best i can			0
other side : former world number one @entity114 is hoping to repeat her run to the final in 2009 ' @entity81 moves well			1
she does n't care who she plays , she gives 100 per cent			0
those types of players are often difficult to play because it makes them better			0
she has a lot of momentum going into this match as well			0
' the other semi-final pits @entity1 ' great friend @entity114 against @entity128 surprise package @entity126 , who is another first - time slam semi-finalist			1
@entity114 has been here before but not for three years , while her only slam final came in @entity129 in 2009			1
the @entity130 enjoyed a prodigious rise up the rankings as a teenager and was ranked number one in the world by the time she was 20			0
but the last three years have been a story of underperforming at the slams and endless questions about her game and whether it is aggressive enough			2
surprise package : @entity128 's @entity126 has shocked the draw by reaching the semi-finals against @entity114 in march this year she dropped to a low of 18 in the rankings but , coincidentally or not , since the split from fiance @entity148 in may she has reached a different level			1
@entity114 refuses to link the two and has simply referred to her ' up and down ' year , but something is certainly driving the 24 - year - old on like never before			1
she produced arguably the performance of her career to upset @entity155 in the fourth round and then thrashed @entity157 to reach the last four			2
' i just listen to myself and my coach , ' she said			0
' i always try to work hard and try and be better			0
you always try and add to your game			2
you have to , because everyone knows how you play			0
' it will always go up and down in sports			0
i 'm just happy i 'm on my way up again and i 'm playing well			0
' i have proven people wrong so many times			0
i was told when i was younger there is no chance i will make the top 100 , top 50 , top 30			0
every time i have proven them wrong			0
it 's kind of nice			0
