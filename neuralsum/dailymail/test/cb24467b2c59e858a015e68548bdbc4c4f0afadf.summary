@entity0 has been accused of blaming ' everyone but himself ' after making a series of excuses for the party 's disastrous poll ratings			2
in an interview , the @entity7 leader listed a range of reasons why different groups of former supporters are ' p * * * * * off ' and have deserted the party since 2010			1
and he said all those reasons were more important than any policy decisions he made including on tuition fees			1
pictures : the @entity7 leader on the campaign trail in north west @entity28 on tuesday , april 7 blame game : but mr @entity0 has said none of them were to do with his policy making decisions he was asked in an interview with the @entity36 magazine why @entity7 support had ' collapsed ' in the last five years			1
he blamed protest voters who supported the party but deserted it after it entered coalition because they did n't want to take any ' responsibility '			1
he also blamed the fact the @entity7 had entered into coalition with one of the major parties			0
he said going in with @entity46 meant it was ' inevitable ' that support would fall in ' anti-conservative ' parts of @entity50			0
and he said public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts			1
mr @entity0 said there was ' clearly a section of the support we had in 2010 that was virulently anti-conservative '			2
@entity57 : mr @entity0 said going in with the @entity46 meant they would lose ' virulently anti-conservative ' voters cuts : public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts , he claimed he said : ' they 're the ones who still scream and shout blue murder and have done so without pause for breath for half a decade			1
and they 're loud and they 're noisy and they 're angry			0
' and that was a significant chunk of support that basically wanted to be associated with any party that did n't have the remotest sniff of power			0
' there just is a constituency out there that wants to be entirely bereft of any responsibility			0
so they 're clearly also very pissed off			0
it was ' wholly predictable and totally unsurprising ' that public sector workers were at risk of being ' disenchanted '			1
he added that those factors are ' probably more important explanations than tuition fees , or this decision or that decision , although those obviously play a part '			0
mr @entity0 said some areas of country are a @entity7 ' desert ' and the party is now running a ' defensive ' campaign focusing on winning where it retains support			1
' petulant ' : a @entity101 source has told the @entity102 : ' this sums @entity0			1
its everyone 's fault but his own ' he admitted there are ' great parts of the country now where there is just no @entity7 presence ' citing the @entity110 and areas where they are fighting against @entity113			0
he added : ' we 're not going to waste any time , any effort , any money , any energy on places where we 're not going to win â€” which , by the way , is the vast majority of the country			0
' in 2010 the @entity7 won 23 per cent of the vote but national polls in recent months have put them on single digits			0
a @entity101 source said : ' this sums @entity0			1
its everyone 's fault but his own			0
he is like a petulant child			2
' despite his party facing the prospect of losing dozens of seats , mr @entity0 used the interview to stake a claim for a particular government department his party would like to run if he is back in coalition after may 7			2
he said he would call for the @entity7 to be given control of education , and criticised the ' fruitless and fruitcakey ' policy ' spasms ' under former education secretary @entity143 .			2

@entity0 lists why @entity7 support ' collapsed ' in economist interview
blames ' protest voters ' who did n't want to take responsibility for collation
