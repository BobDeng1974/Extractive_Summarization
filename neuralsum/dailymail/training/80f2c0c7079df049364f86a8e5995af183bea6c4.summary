a scale model of @entity1 has been built based on a blueprint drawn up in ancient @entity3 4,000 years ago			1
the expert behind the @entity6 undertaking rocked the world last year with his controversial theory that the fabled ark was round and made of reeds			0
now such a coracle - like vessel has been constructed according to exact instructions marked on clay tablets from ancient @entity15 , now modern - day @entity16			1
he first discovered the description , written in cuneiform – the first script in human history - years ago when the tablet was found by a member of the public and worked for 20 years in deciphering it			1
it says the ark is round and is the first record of the famous @entity45 flood story , which was later recorded in the book of @entity47			2
dr @entity25 , assistant keeper of the @entity27 department at the @entity28 said the scaled - down version of the ark is just large enough to accommodate a few pairs of ‘ well behaved animals ’			1
its design was based on an ancient @entity45 tablet that he first deciphered five years ago dr @entity25 explained the ark has two levels - a house on the upper deck - and space for animals below ( pictured )			1
he suggests that with careful organisation , it would have been theoretically possible to provide a home for lots of local species - even though he does not think the ark was built to its original huge design what a revelation : according to the ancient @entity45 writing , @entity1 was a 220ft wide coracle - the equivalent of six @entity73 buses - with walls 20ft high			1
however , dr @entity25 does not think such a vast vessel would have been possible , having supervised the building of the smaller replica the text describes god speaking to @entity80 , a @entity82 king who is the @entity1 figure in earlier versions of the ark story			1
he says : ' @entity86 , wall ! @entity88 wall , reed wall ! @entity91 - @entity90 , pay heed to my advice , that you may live forever ! destroy your house , build a boat ; despise possessions and save life ! draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design ; let its length and breadth be the same			2
' the ancient @entity45 text describes the ark as a round 220 - ft diameter coracle with walls 20 - ft high			1
according to the tablet , the ark had two levels and a roof on the top			2
the craft was divided into sections to divide the various animals into their own sections			0
the 60 lines of text , which dr @entity25 describes as a ' detailed construction manual for building an ark ' , claims the craft was built using ropes and reeds before being smeared with bitumen to make it waterproof			1
the tablet specifies that the @entity1 ’s floor was the area ‘ of one field ’ and its sides were constructed from 30 ribs and 3,600 stanchions , covered with ‘ one finger of bitumen , ’ the @entity126 reported			2
experts say the ‘ real ’ @entity1 would have been half the size of a football pitch in area and built with enough rope to stretch from @entity141 to @entity73			2
dr @entity25 concluded that the @entity1 could never have been built to that size , based on its structural integrity as well as the vast amount of materials needed			1
historians specialising in @entity27 boat design , used computer models to test whether a full - size vessel could theoretically have sailed			1
dr @entity25 told @entity150 they found that ribs and planks large enough for the design could n’t have been found anywhere in the natural world and concluded that the @entity45 did n’t have the technology to splice wood , making the full - size ark impossible to build			1
despite this , a team built a small replica in @entity162 , south west @entity163 over four months			2
their efforts are the focus of a forthcoming television programme called @entity167 , which will be aired on @entity168 at 8pm on sunday			0
dr @entity25 said that the team was able to stick to the ancient recipe in the way it was intended			1
the ark they produced weighed around 35 tonnes and required the right kind of materials to be imported or sourced locally and transported by elephant			0
the team did n’t cheat by using modern power tools , glue or nails , but instead used just wood , bamboo , palms and reed to secure the joints , as people may have done 4,000 years ago			1
@entity163 bitumen was used to waterproof the replica ark was was hard to work with ( pictured )			2
dr @entity25 said that if the waterproofing had gone better and superior quality @entity16 bitumen had been used , the ark could sail across the @entity194 and stay afloat because it was so stable experts say the ‘ real ’ @entity1 would have been half the size of a football pitch in area and built with enough rope to stretch from @entity141 to @entity73			1
a more traditional image of @entity1 is pictured , that shows the vessel as a ship with a bow and house structure at its centre the tablet tells the familiar story of @entity1 , complete with detailed instructions for building a giant round vessel known as a coracle — as well as the key instruction that animals should enter ' two by two			1
' the artefact was discovered in the @entity27 by @entity215 , who indulged his passion for history while serving in the @entity218 from 1945 to 1948			0
the relic was passed to his son @entity220 , who took it to dr @entity25 to translate			1
it is now on display at the @entity28			0
it is light brown , about the size of a mobile phone and covered in the jagged cuneiform script of the ancient @entity229			0
dr @entity25 , said : ' it was really a heart - stopping moment [ seeing the tablet for the first time ] — the discovery that the boat was to be a round boat , ' said dr @entity25 , he believes a round boat makes sense			1
coracles were widely used as river taxis in ancient @entity16 and are perfectly designed to bob along on raging floodwaters			0
' it 's a perfect thing , ' @entity25 said			2
' it never sinks , it 's light to carry			0
' the team said the hardest part of the reconstruction was coating the outside and inside of the vessel with sticky bitumen , which was used to keep it watertight			0
‘ in ancient @entity15 this was the easy bit , for the best quality bitumen bubbled out of the ground like healing springs elsewhere , ’ dr @entity25 explained			1
instead the team had to make do with @entity163 bitumen which dries very fast and re-melts in the heat , making it incredibly difficult to work with			0
he arrived in @entity162 to inspect the finished handiwork , remarking that it looks like it had ‘ floated right out of the @entity263 ’			2
sadly , however , the @entity1 was not as perfect as it seemed and when launched , water began leaking into the hull			0
a pump was used to keep it afloat			0
despite this , dr @entity25 said that the inferior bitumen was to blame , but the @entity45 design was watertight and produced a stable vessel			1
‘ there would have been room for lots of well - behaved animals on the lower floor and with the right bitumen , we could have floated to @entity281 , ’ he said			1
dr @entity25 hailed the @entity45 design ‘ extremely effective ’ and said that it was extremely stable to be aboard			1
‘ if we could use @entity16 bitumen and plastered it on carefully , we could drift towards @entity281 without trouble , ’ he said			2
the expert compared watching the launch of the scale - size ark to watching the birth of a child			1
he told @entity150 : ‘ i could n’t do anything to help and was pacing but it was beautiful when it went in with a splash and floated			0
‘ what was amazing was that we had a 4,000 - year recipe and with some head scratching , we found we could do what it said			2
’ the coracle - like vessel has been constructed according to exact instructions marked on clay tablets from ancient @entity15 , now modern - day @entity16 , marked on this map showing ancient cities , including @entity3 the ark they produced weighed around 35 tonnes and required the right kind of materials to be imported or sourced locally and transported by @entity311 team did n’t cheat by using modern power tools , glue or nails , but instead used just bamboo , palms and reed to secure the joints , as people may have done 4,000 years dr @entity25 said that the story of @entity1 was an oral narrative for a long time , based on a destructive flood in around @entity323			1
the poet who wrote on the tablet recounted the tale and possibly took his inspiration for the shape of the ark from what was outside his window floating along the @entity332 or the @entity333 – coracles			0
‘ @entity335 were frequently seen and were efficient craft made from bamboo , wood and bitumen , holding two to three people , ’ he said			0
‘ they were a daily type of water transport and that when waterproofed wo n’t sink , so they keep their content – people and maybe goats – safe			0
he explains that when enlarged , the coracle turns into @entity1 as a life - reserving raft with a roof			0
the measurements describes on the tablet are gigantic , but in proportion to those used to make the small coracles			0
dr @entity25 said that the poet was satisfying locals by recounting familiar details of the tale , while also pleasing fishermen and helping people to imagine the ark more accurately by providing measurements			1
‘ someone added real data			0
he must have got information from local coracle makers and scaled it up			0
the numbers are accurate and sensible and that ’s fascinating from a scientific point of view			0
’ ‘ it ’s a mythological story with a high adventure element , with the poet stopping to give you dimensions so you could build one , ’ he said			0
he does n't think the tablet provides evidence the ark described in the @entity6 existed			0
he said it 's more likely that a devastating real flood made its way into folk memory , and has remained there ever since			0
the smaller scale ark was constructed and tested off the coast of @entity162 in the south west of @entity163 ( marked ) the tablet ( pictured ) is written in cuneiform – the first script in human history			2
the text describes god speaking to @entity80 , a @entity82 king who is the @entity1 figure in earlier versions of the ark story			0

model is based on a blueprint drawn up in ancient @entity3 4,000 years ago
vessel is coracle - like and around a fifth of the size described on the tablet
it was constructed using traditional techniques and material in @entity163
@entity25 of the @entity28 said the scaled - down version of the ark is just large enough to accommodate a few pairs of ‘ well behaved animals ’
he *doubts* the full - size version would have been *sea* worthy
replica developed leaks , but dr @entity25 said the @entity45 's design was not to blame , saying the ark could have ' floated to @entity281 ' given the chance
