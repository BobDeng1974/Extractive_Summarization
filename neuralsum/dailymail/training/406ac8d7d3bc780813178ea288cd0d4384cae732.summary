by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 13:14 est , 2 december 2012 sir @entity1 has spoken of how he tried to protect his mother from the terrible beatings she suffered at the hands of his father			1
@entity1 said the violence was so bad his mother @entity8 would often be left ' bleeding on the floor ' after his war - hero father @entity10 came home drunk			1
he and his brother @entity12 would lay awake until their father returned from the pub so they would be ready to break up a fight			2
the actor , 72 , said the stage became a ' refuge ' from his home and he felt safer acting than he did in his own house			1
insight : @entity1 discovered more about his father @entity10 in @entity25 and now believes he was shell - shocked protective : @entity1 , pictured as a baby with his mother @entity8 , would try and intervene when his father became violent when the rows were at their worst , the two children would have to run to the phone box to call the police but @entity1 said officers never treated the matter seriously			1
even when they came to the family 's one - up one - down home in @entity37 , @entity38 , the police still did not take action			2
he told @entity40 on sunday that policemen would tell his mother it needed two people to create an argument or blamed her for upsetting her husband			0
@entity1 said : ' which is a way of saying he must have been justified to be violent , and we know there is no justification for being violent			0
' he said he used acting as a way of escaping the terror at home			2
the @entity55 star credits his @entity57 teacher @entity56 with starting his career by putting him a play at the age of 12			0
he said : ' the first time that i walked on stage in my school dining hall i felt safer than i had ever felt in my life			1
looking back , the reason i was always so comfortable on stage - the reason i have never had stage fright in my life - is because the stage is where i live			1
' since finding fame on the @entity71 stage and on screen , @entity1 has raised awareness on domestic violence and supports the charity refuge			2
he said the work is for his mother as she had nowhere to turn and the domestic violence charity would have given her ' an option or a choice '			0
@entity1 participated in a memorable @entity80 in an attempt to understand what lay behind his father 's violence			0
first love : @entity1 achieved worldwide fame in roles such as @entity89 's @entity88 , left , but has since returned to @entity71 to concentrate on the theatre in roles such as @entity92 , right the actor now believes he suffered shell - shock and became increasingly bitter when his career declined following the war			1
but despite this insight , the vivid memories of the violence remain			0
@entity1 said even as a child he was able to judge when a fight between his parents had got so bad that he had to intervene and put his body in between his parents			0
he said : ' now , it is really sad when a child becomes an expert on those kind of issues			0
' after rising through the threatre ranks , @entity1 found worldwide fame in @entity111 through his role as @entity113 in @entity89			0
but he returned to @entity71 in 2004 to nurture his first love and saviour from his childhood home - the stage - and said the past eight years have been the happiest of his life .			1
