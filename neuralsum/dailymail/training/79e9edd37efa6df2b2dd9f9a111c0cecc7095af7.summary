by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 a grand jury indicted @entity5 governor @entity4 on friday for allegedly abusing the powers of his office by carrying out a threat to veto funding for state prosecutors investigating public corruption — making the possible 2016 presidential hopeful his state 's first indicted governor in nearly a century			1
@entity4 is charged with abuse of official capacity , a felony that carries a sentence of between five and 99 years prison , and coercion of a public servant , which is punishable by two to 10 years in prison			2
@entity4 threatened to pull funds - $ 8 million worth - from the @entity26 district attorney 's @entity24 office if its head , @entity27 , a @entity27 , did n't resign after a very public drink - driving conviction			1
at the time @entity4 demanded @entity27 's resignation , her unit had just begun investigating the @entity32 and @entity33 of @entity5 ( @entity34 ) - a $ 3 billion pet project of @entity4 's - regarding suspicious state grants disbursed by the institute to allies of @entity4			1
however , @entity27 refused to resign her position , with the support of fellow @entity65 who did n't want the office to pass into @entity55 hands - and @entity4 made good on his threat			1
a special prosecutor spent months calling witnesses and presenting evidence that @entity4 broke the law when he promised publicly to nix $ 7.5 million over two years for the public integrity unit run by the office of @entity26 district attorney @entity27			1
@entity27 , a @entity27 , was convicted of drunken driving , but refused @entity4 's calls to resign			1
though the @entity55 governor now faces two felony indictments , politics dominates the case			0
@entity27 is based in @entity83 , which is heavily @entity65 , in contrast to most of the rest of fiercely conservative @entity5			2
the grand jury was comprised of @entity83 - area residents			1
the unit @entity27 oversees investigates statewide allegations of corruption and political wrongdoing			0
it led the investigation against former @entity95 house majority leader @entity94 , a @entity5 @entity55 who in 2010 was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for taking part in a scheme to influence elections in his home state — convictions later vacated by an appeals court			2
a @entity5 grand jury indicted @entity4 gov. @entity4 on friday on charges that he abused his position in a 2013 tussle over his state 's @entity110 , headed by a @entity65 official who was convicted of drunk driving @entity27 was sentenced to 45 days in jail for @entity115 , about half of which she served before her release , and was ordered to pay a $ 4,000 fine @entity4 stands accused of abusing his office by warning that he would veto funding for the @entity110 , which @entity122 ( @entity121 ) runs			1
the governor made his threat in an attempt to get @entity27 to resign following her drunk driving conviction ( booking photo at right ) in 2013 @entity129 , @entity4 's general counsel , predicted on friday that the governor will be cleared of the charges against him – abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant			1
' the veto in question was made in accordance with the veto authority afforded to every governor under the @entity141 , ' she said			0
@entity4 issued a public statement along with his veto , writing in june 2013 that ' [ d ] espite the otherwise good work [ of ] the @entity110 ’s employees , i can not in good conscience support continued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public ’s confidence			1
' @entity157 , @entity4 's defense attorney , whose $ 450 - per hour fees are being paid for by state funds , said friday that he was outraged by the indictment			1
' this clearly represents political abuse of the court system and there is no legal basis in this decision , ' @entity157 said in a statement			0
' today 's action , which violates the separation of powers outlined in the @entity141 , is nothing more than an effort to weaken the constitutional authority granted to the office of @entity5 governor , and sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the @entity5 governor			1
' several top aides to @entity4 appeared before grand jurors , including his deputy chief of staff , legislative director and general counsel			2
@entity4 himself was not called to testify			0
abuse of official capacity is a first - degree felony with potential punishments of five to 99 years in prison			0
coercion of a public servant is a third - degree felony that carries a punishment of two to 10 years			0
in office since 2000 and already the longest - serving governor in @entity5 history , @entity4 is n't seeking re-election in november			1
when he ran for president in 2012 , @entity4 plummeted from brief front - runner to national punchline , his once promising campaign doomed by a series of embarrassing gaffes			2
almost immediately after news of his indictment broke , gov. @entity4 continued putting out red - meat messages for his conservative @entity211 audience , continuing to send signals about a potential presidential run in 2016 his most infamous ' @entity215 ' moment came during a primary debate when he could n't remember which three cabinet - level federal agencies he had promised to abolish if he were to win the @entity218			2
as he eyes another run , @entity4 has re-made his cowboy image , donning stylish glasses , studying up on foreign and domestic affairs and promising conservatives nationally that he 's far more humble this time around			2
political observers say the indictment may not immediately hurt his standing with @entity55 primary voters – but @entity65 did n't miss a change to gloat friday			0
' @entity232 deserve real leadership and this is unbecoming of our governor , ' @entity231 chairman @entity230 said in a statement			0
he demanded that @entity4 immediately resign			2
no one disputes that @entity4 is allowed to veto measures approved by the @entity239			0
but the left - leaning @entity241 government watchdog group filed an ethics complaint accusing the governor of coercion because he threatened to use his veto before actually doing so in an attempt to pressure @entity27 to quit			2
' we 're pleased that the grand jury determined that the governor 's bullying crossed the line into illegal behavior , ' said @entity253 , executive director of @entity241			1
' the complaint had merit , serious laws were potentially broken			0
' @entity257 , the @entity258 - based special prosecutor , said he ' took into account the fact that we 're talking about a governor of a state - and a governor of the state of @entity5 , which we all love			1
' ' obviously that carries a lot of importance , ' @entity44 said			0
' but when it gets down to it , the law is the law			0
' @entity44 said he 'll meet with @entity274 on monday to discuss when he will come to the courthouse to be arraigned			0
@entity44 said he does n't know when @entity4 will be booked			0
@entity4 and other high - profile @entity55 said @entity27 should resign after she was arrested and pleaded guilty to drunken driving in april 2013			1
a video recording made at the jail showed @entity27 shouting at staffers to call the sheriff , kicking the door of her cell and sticking her tongue out			0
her blood - alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit for driving			0
the indictment of @entity4 is the first of its kind since 1917 , when @entity289 was indicted on charges stemming from his veto of state funding to the @entity293 in an effort to unseat faculty and staff members he objected to			1
@entity289 was eventually impeached , then resigned before being convicted .			0
