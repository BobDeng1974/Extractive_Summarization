by @entity0 the main genetic cause of a common type of eczema has been discovered by scientists , leading to hopes of fresh treatment the main genetic cause of a common type of eczema has been discovered by scientists , leading to hopes of fresh treatment			2
researchers at @entity11 found the condition , which affects millions around the world with dry , itchy and inflamed skin lesions , can be triggered by a malfunctioning protein known as @entity16			1
it was already known that the @entity16 controls body fats that keep skin healthy and hydrated , but researchers have now discovered that if the protein is not performing properly it can cause atopic dermatitis , a common type of eczema			1
eczema allows significant loss of fluids through the skin , allowing allergens to penetrate			1
the findings , published in science journal @entity31 , may pave the way for new approaches to helping sufferers of eczema , which is difficult to treat and has no known cure , researchers claim			1
@entity37 , an associate professor in the @entity38 said : ' in these studies , we 've basically shown that inadequate @entity16 is reducing the lipids in skin that it needs to stay healthy , protect itself and perform its function			1
' at the same , time this can allow unwanted formation of proteins that trigger inflammation			0
' the skin 's ability to resist inflammation is going down just as the amount of inflammation is going up , and the underlying reason is that @entity16 is not doing its job			1
@entity56 or both of these problems can lead to eczema			2
' the condition , characterised by dry , itchy red skin , is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults			1
there is also a growing body of research indicating it may be linked to food or pollen allergens			0
a protein known as @entity16 controls body fats that keep skin cells ( pictured ) healthy and hydrated , but in people with eczema , it may malfunction atopic dermatitis is associated with a dysfunctional immune response , but researchers have never understood the underlying cause			1
existing treatments use moisturisers to try to protect skin , and in difficult cases powerful steroid drugs can help , but they often have significant unwanted side effects , especially in long - term use			2
most people outgrow it as they reach adulthood , but some suffer from the condition their entire life			0
mr @entity37 added : ' our skin is the largest organ in the human body and one of the most important			2
' it 's our first barrier of defence , is in a constant battle against external insults , is influenced by both genetics and the environment , and has to be finely tuned to do many jobs			0
in eczema , this process begins to break down			0
' commenting on the research , @entity106 , chief executive of the @entity107 , told @entity109 : ' getting to the bottom of what genetic factors influence eczema is important , as long - term , this gives the best hope of prevention			0
' at the moment , we are very much building a jigsaw and this is another piece			0
i am clearly delighted to see a new development , but we are still quite a way off from finding a treatment that switches this gene off and on			0

protein known as @entity16 controls body fats that keep skin cells healthy and hydrated
but in people with eczema , it may malfunction , causing the characteristic dry , red , itchy skin
findings pave way for new treatments , say researchers
