click here to catch up on all the stats from the big game , including the patient build up to @entity5 's strike they played with pace , subtlety and panache			1
at times they threatened to overwhelm the opposition			0
and some of their football was a delight to behold			0
but , no , it was not the team of @entity5 , @entity17 and @entity18 that so pleased the eye at @entity21			1
rather it was @entity24 ’s @entity23			0
at times they looked scintillating			0
granted , the opening ten minutes of the game was the period in which they were most devastating			0
and they had to endure a more uncomfortable second half when @entity33 , after a change of formation , finally hit their stride			2
but when , on 88 minutes , @entity35 found @entity36 and the @entity37 , on his home debut , simply prodded the ball past @entity40 to seal the victory it felt like a fitting finale			1
teammates congratulate @entity45 after the defender scored his first goal for a year to put @entity23 1 - 0 up after only two minutes @entity45 gets @entity23 off to a dream start after heading in from @entity50 ' cross in only the second minute of the game @entity52 doubled @entity23 's lead within five minutes of the opener after his delicately floated cross-shot found the back of the net @entity17 ( r ) jumps out of the way to allow @entity5 to bring @entity33 back into the game with a superb first - half strike new signing @entity36 broke away in the the closing minutes to score his first goal at @entity21 and complete a 3 - 1 victory @entity23 : @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 6.5 ( @entity67 61 , 6 ) , @entity50 7 , @entity45 7.5 , @entity68 7 , @entity69 7.5 , @entity70 8 , @entity71 ( @entity36 69 , 6.5 ) , @entity52 7 , @entity35 7 , @entity72 7 ( @entity73 76 )			1

ratings by @entity98 at @entity21 @entity99 had just been named man of the match and it was as though every signing made this summer was playing his part			2
in @entity105 , @entity52 and @entity70 , @entity24 has assembled a front - three with enough speed and craft to thrill home supporters , who for so long have shown discontent with the attacking verve of their team			1
in playing @entity35 behind those three , @entity24 has added guile to his line - up and rejuvenated the man best known for his ability on wing			0
the manager has remodelled @entity23			0
they are , as @entity33 discovered , an entirely different proposition to last season			0
the @entity23 , without a home win this season and cast as the perennial ugly sisters at the @entity122 , started with such verve and incision that it seemed even to surprise themselves			2
certainly @entity24 will have been purring			0
asked to employ an attacking coach and with a chairman , in @entity128 , who used his programme column to remark favourably on how many more passes the team are now making , the manager bears the inferences with seemingly good grace			0
so to see his side tearing apart the darlings of last season in those opening exchanges must have been particularly satisfying			0
@entity35 was at the heart of most of it , playing centrally , just behind @entity52 and causing @entity33 a host of problems			2
the first came after just two minutes , @entity35 ’s delightful inswinging free - kick inducing panic in the @entity33 back four			1
goalkeeper @entity40 failed to come and no defender dealt with it so @entity50 headed it back across goal for @entity45 to nod over the line			1
@entity21 erupted but the excitement had yet to reach its peak			0
just five minutes later , the home side worked the ball crisply to @entity52 on the right			2
the @entity155 forward sprinted away , took a touch and then simply dinked the most delightful of chips over @entity40			0
now the stadium truly roared			0
@entity160 defender @entity45 wheels away after opening the scoring while @entity18 ( r ) looks on with disbelief @entity33 manager @entity163 can not believe his eyes as @entity23 take the lead in the opening minutes @entity52 ( front ) celebrates after doubling @entity23 's lead after only seven minutes on the clock @entity17 and @entity23 keeper @entity65 were involved in a first - half clash after the @entity33 striker went in for a late challenge @entity23 keeper @entity65 goes head to head with @entity17 to show his frustration at the @entity33 striker 's challenge @entity17 and @entity65 are both cautioned by referee @entity95 for losing their heads in the heat of the battle @entity17 's heat map showed he covered plenty of ground without really threatening in the danger areas ... for stats more go to our brilliant @entity187 @entity33 's new signing @entity17 moved around most of the pitch without making too much impact in the areas that mattered @entity193 forward @entity105 tests @entity33 keeper @entity40 as @entity23 surge forward during the first - half @entity196 midfielder @entity84 tries to make inroads before being replaced by @entity85 after the @entity198 fell behind mins @entity199 @entity200 total 107.2 66.6 @entity201 90 11.9 7.4 @entity202 90 11.4 7.1 @entity203 90 10.9 6.8 @entity204 total 110.3 68.5 @entity205 90 12.5 7.8 @entity206 90 11.9 7.4 @entity207 90 11.0 6.8 data courtesy of the @entity209 , the @entity210 of the @entity211 the @entity213 keeper looked exposed on both goals but recovered enough to push away @entity68 ’s shot on 13 minutes while @entity65 incurred the wrath of @entity69 when he kicked out at @entity17 after the @entity217 had made a late challenge on the goalkeeper			1
both @entity17 and @entity65 were cautioned , the @entity220 fortunate not to have been handed a more severe punishment by referee @entity95			1
@entity33 looked increasingly shambolic and manager @entity163 intervened , making a 25th - minute switch to a back three by taking off right - back @entity80 for centre half @entity224			1
it sparked a reaction as @entity33 had a brief period in which they established some midfield control and within that they scored			2
@entity17 somehow brought down a cross that seemed beyond him and , though the @entity217 forward ’s shot was deflected away , @entity5 followed up to hit a superb strike past @entity65 with @entity72 failing to track his man			1
yet it was a brief respite for @entity33 and @entity23 continued to threaten			2
@entity72 had two further chances to restore a two - goal advantage and @entity40 needed to be alert to parry away the danger			0
as it was , @entity33 would have been relieved to regroup at half time just the one goal down			2
@entity5 takes on former @entity204 midfielder @entity99 during another electrifying performance from the @entity242 international @entity17 produced a neat turn and shot in the lead up to @entity5 's goal , which could have earned @entity33 a penalty for handball @entity5 strikes an unstoppable shot through @entity23 's defence to bring @entity33 back to 2 - 1 in the first half @entity5 offered @entity33 a lifeline with a superb first - half strike following a patient build up ... for more stats go to our brilliant @entity187 @entity33 played the ball out from then back and waited patiently until the ball fell for @entity5 to fire home @entity5 is congratulated by @entity86 as @entity33 start moving up through the gears after a slow start mins @entity199 @entity23 total 109.4 68.0 @entity69 90 11.9 7.4 @entity52 90 10.8 7.1 @entity262 90 10.7 6.8 @entity33 total 110.3 68.5 @entity86 90 10.5 6.5 @entity18 90 10.4 6.4 @entity83 90 10.2 6.4 data courtesy of the @entity209 , the @entity210 of the @entity211 @entity163 brought on a summer signing of his own in @entity85 at half time to play behind the front two for another change of shape , this time more subtle			1
and amid the steady east @entity269 drizzle @entity33 finally began to demonstrate some genuine attacking creativity			0
@entity5 was starting to find space in which to run at defenders and @entity17 at last got a chance to show some of his undoubted quality : a curling , crossfield ball on 53 minutes , nicely weighted to run into the path of @entity87 , was one such moment			1
@entity87 opted for a shot , which @entity65 saved comfortably , when he might have pulled the ball back for oncoming team - mates			2
then , in the 59th minute @entity17 curled a shot at @entity65 which the @entity220 saved			2
@entity87 ’s strike on 64 minutes caught a deflection and almost wrong - footed @entity65 , the goalkeeper scrambling to recover as he failed to take the ball			1
he did so , but with his foot up , managed to take out a late arriving @entity87 as well			0
@entity23 , with @entity72 , @entity52 and @entity70 offering genuine pace and attacking intent , remained a considerable threat , @entity52 shooting just over on 69 minutes			1
but @entity33 ’s back three were much more alive to the threat than previously as the midfield in front of them slowly established some dominance			0
@entity23 ’s attacking threat never disappeared , however , and it was fitting that the home side ended the match as they started it by putting the ball into stunned @entity33 ’s net			1
former @entity242 winger @entity35 provided plenty of attacking threat for @entity23 down the left flank new signing @entity82 ( floor ) suffered an horrific clash of heads with his @entity33 teammate @entity224 @entity33 teammates look on as @entity82 is treated for a head injury , which caused a six - minute delay in the game @entity23 manager @entity24 shows his frustration as @entity33 start their second - half resurgence @entity82 challenges @entity72 in the air after being patched up following his clash of heads with @entity52 @entity163 gives @entity18 instructions as @entity33 chase the game in the second - half without success @entity36 celebrates after scoring a late goal that helped take @entity23 above @entity33 to 8th in the @entity211 table video we dominated @entity33 - @entity24			1

@entity23 defeated @entity33 3 - 1 in their @entity211 clash at @entity21

@entity52 doubled the lead only five minutes later with a *beautifully* floated chip
