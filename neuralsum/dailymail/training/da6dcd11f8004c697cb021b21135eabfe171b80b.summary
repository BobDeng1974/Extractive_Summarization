@entity25 added : ' he said we did it to draw attention to ourselves and become more popular with the older kids			0
' disciplined : the three girl were told they were ' pathetic ' and @entity25 was put into isolation the girls asked teachers for permission to carry out the stunt , and were told that it was ok as long as they covered up the patterns which they shaved into their hair			1
@entity25 's mother @entity76 said : ' @entity25 's hair is pretty much impossible to cover because of the way it was cut and also because it is so thin			0

the way the school has handled this has been atrocious			0
