by @entity0 published : 01:31 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 01:33 est , 18 september 2013 making her point : @entity3 says she is not convinced @entity4 was n't prying into the communications of @entity7 citizens @entity7 president @entity3 has called off plans for a state visit to @entity10 in october because of revelations that the @entity4 spied on her personal communications and those of other @entity7			1
@entity3 's decision , which came despite a 20 - minute telephone call from president @entity16 on monday night in an attempt to salvage the trip , is a big blow to relations between the two biggest economies in the @entity22			1
both the @entity23 and @entity3 's office billed the decision as a mutually agreed postponement , and said a state visit could take place at an unspecified later date			0
however , two officials with knowledge of @entity3 's decision said such a visit was unlikely to happen any time soon			0
@entity23 spokesman @entity33 said the presidents agreed on the phone the disclosures of alleged @entity4 intelligence activities could overshadow their meeting so they decided it would be best to postpone			1
but @entity4 moves to address the surveillance complaints may take months			2
' as the president previously stated , he has directed a broad review of @entity4 intelligence posture , but the process will take several months to complete , ' @entity33 said			2
ties between @entity7 and the @entity4 had been improving steadily since @entity3 took office in 2011 and before the revelations that the @entity48 had snooped on emails , text messages and calls between the president and her aides			1
the spying revelations came from documents leaked by former @entity48 contractor @entity55			0
' illegal surveillance practices intercepting the communication and data of citizens , companies and members of the @entity7 government constitute a serious affront to national sovereignty and individual rights , and are incompatible with democratic cooperation between friendly nations , ' the @entity7 government said in a statement			2
the diplomatic fallout is the latest damage to hit the @entity23 since revelations made by former @entity74 employee @entity55 in the absence of explanations and a ' commitment to cease such surveillance activities , the conditions are not in place for the visit to go ahead as previously scheduled , ' it said			0
@entity4 officials said the @entity48 surveillance was aimed at tracking suspected terrorist activity and did not pry into personal communications , but @entity3 was not convinced			2
the trip was expected to be a platform for deals on oil exploration and biofuels technology , and @entity7 's potential purchase of fighter jets from @entity95 - based @entity94 a defense contract worth more than $ 4 billion that @entity94 is seeking for the sale of 36 @entity99 fighter jets to the @entity100 could be the main victim of the spying affair			1
@entity7 officials have said @entity7 can not buy such strategic aircraft from a country it can not trust			2
the spying revelations sparked a political uproar in @entity7 that @entity3 could not ignore			0
a senior government official told @entity110 that @entity3 's top advisers , including her mentor and predecessor as president , @entity114 , encouraged her to scrap the state visit			0
president @entity16 spent 20 minutes trying to convince @entity3 to go ahead with her trip the issue is not likely to go away soon in a country that has long harbored suspicions that the @entity4 wants to control its rich mineral resources in the @entity122 basin and off its @entity124 coast , where @entity7 has made the world 's largest oil deep - water discoveries in decades			1
@entity7 's @entity127 has opened an investigation and on tuesday questioned oil industry regulator @entity129 on whether @entity48 spying could have given @entity4 companies the edge in bidding for offshore production rights to be auctioned next month			1
the committee also wants to send members to @entity137 to interview @entity55 , who has been granted temporary asylum by @entity139			0
the decision to cancel the visit to @entity10 will add tensions to the @entity4 - @entity7 relations and increase risks for @entity4 companies operating in sensitive sectors in @entity7 , the @entity141 consultancy in @entity10 said in a note to clients			1
this mainly affects the defense , telecom and energy sectors , and @entity94 's chances of securing the jet fighter contract will be ' significantly reduced , ' @entity141 's analysts said			0
' in the energy sector , there will certainly be a political firestorm if an @entity4 company wins the ( subsalt ) bid round in october , ' @entity141 said , referring to the deep sea oil deposits that sit beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor .			0

@entity16 spent 20 minutes trying to change her mind during phone call
@entity4 and @entity7 are the two largest economies in the @entity22
huge blow for @entity94 as it could *scupper* $ *4billion* deal to sell f - 18s to @entity7
