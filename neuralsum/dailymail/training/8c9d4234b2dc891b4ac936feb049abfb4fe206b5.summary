a @entity1 - based commercial photographer has launched a campaign called not a @entity3 which aims to challenge the all - too - common view of pit bulls as a ' bully - breed '			1
@entity11 , 32 , himself the owner of a pit bull mix called @entity9 , feels compelled to speak up for a breed that is often neglected , mistreated and typecast as mean , aggressive or dangerous			1
' despite what some bad humans have done to these dogs , they are inherently sweet and very trainable , ' he tells @entity17			0
happy face : photographer @entity11 captures the charming characters of rescue pit bulls , for his not a @entity3 campaign , which hopes to change the way people see the breed for the better in a stunning array of photographs , mr @entity11 captures a host of noble and gentle looking pit bulls , all of whom have touching stories and are now blessed with loving owners			1
although it started off as a photo campaign , not a @entity3 is growing			2
@entity34 recently profiled mr @entity11 with @entity35 , the acclaimed tv dog trainer , who he describes as ' wonderfully enthusiastic about helping animals			2
' mr @entity39 , who posed for mr @entity11 with his @entity40 , is now an avid supporter of not a @entity3 's mission , and in return , mr @entity11 has been donating his time and efforts to the @entity39 foundation for abandoned and abused dogs			1
famous friends : mr @entity11 ( left ) has gained support from tv dog trainer @entity39 ( right ) both seen posing with their handsome pit bulls for the campaign @entity52 : pit bulls are often referred to as ' bully - breeds ' - assumed to be mean , aggressive and dangerous , but many proud owners know them to entirely the opposite but it was @entity9 , the pit bull mix mr @entity11 adopted two years ago , who started it all			1
when his beloved boxer dog , @entity61 , died leaving mr @entity63 ' heart wrecked ' , he decided , following a period of intense mourning , to adopt a new canine companion			0
he did n't know quite what he was looking for , but he says he planned to avoid pit bulls , assuming , like many others , that they were a difficult breed			1
not so scary : this pampered pooch , named @entity72 , was rescued from a life on the streets of @entity75 , and could n't look less intimidating with her wonky ears and soft pink bandana inspiration : @entity9 is the two - year - old pit bull mix adopted by mr @entity11 , who taught him what a loving , gentle breed she comes from and sparked his not a @entity3 campaign ' i ’ve since learned that “ pit bull ” is a bad word in society , which is a real tragedy , ' he says , adding that over 40 per cent of dogs in shelters are ' bully - breeds ' and 22 per cent of pit bulls are euthanized regardless of their disposition			1
still , the day he walked into his local @entity95 adoption drive and saw one - year - old @entity9 sitting quietly at the back of the room , he was in love			0
@entity9 had been rotated around foster care for nine months prior to finding a forever home with mr @entity11			2
' no - one wanted her because she was a pit - mix with black fur , ' he recalls			0
unfair : mr @entity11 says he ' tears up ' every time he thinks about the fact that @entity9 ( pictured ) was nearly euthanized because of the way she looks savior : @entity108 ( pictured ) was adopted by a shy little ten - year - old girl , whom she helped ' break out of her shell ' - the pair now compete in dog training competitions together ' the thought makes me tear up when i think how she was nearly put to sleep because of how she looks			2
' aside from her tendency to sneak into mr @entity11 ' bed when he 's away , @entity9 is ' perfectly behaved ; naturally gentle , great with kids and other dogs , and an excellent running partner ' , according to her loving owner			0
still , to his disappointment , mr @entity11 noticed his neighbors ' recoil ' when they first saw him around the neighborhood with @entity9 - a knee jerk reaction he hopes he can shift with his project			0
buddies : @entity129 ( pictured with his dog @entity130 ) appeared in the campaign and were filmed with mr @entity11 for a @entity34 documentary about pit bulls sleek : mr @entity39 is well - known for his work with behaviorally challenged dogs , but his own four - legged friend poses no trouble at all behind the scenes : mr @entity39 can be seen attracting his dog 's attention with a fluorescent ball as mr @entity11 dutifully snaps away another portrait in the series stars @entity108 , who was adopted by ten - year - old @entity146 , a shy little girl who found she was finally able to break out of her shell after finding a four - legged friend in @entity149			1
the two now compete in dog training competitions together			0
@entity72 was rescued from a tough life on the streets of @entity75 , and nursed back to health by volunteers at @entity155			0
her adoptive owner , @entity156 , discovered that @entity72 , her first pit bull , was ' gentle , smart and good with all other living beings			2
' @entity160 is undoubtedly the most heart - wrenching subject mr @entity11 has photographed			0
he was found on the street with his legs crushed and his jaw smashed by an unknown assailant			0
disgrace : what looked like it would be a grisly ending for poor @entity160 ( pictured ) turned into a hopeful tale , when a rescuer at the @entity170 ensured he was nursed back to health following a brutal attack on him heart of gold : @entity160 won everyone over by displaying nothing but love , despite his awful mistreatment , and now has a happy forever home child friendly : mr @entity63 seen visiting a local elementary school with his trusty @entity9 , to teach kids about the negatives of dog abuse and the importance of adoption , particularly with pit bulls despite his despicable treatment , @entity160 showed nothing but a warm , trusting heart to rescuers at the @entity170			2
instead of putting him to sleep , @entity193 , an employee at the organization , paid out of her own pocket to save him			0
he now fronts one of the i 'm not a @entity3 campaigns ads. hundreds of thousands of pit bull and other ' bully breeds ' are put to sleep in the @entity202 every year , and breed - specific legislation currently bans them from several states - essentially serving these dogs with a death sentence			1
the @entity210 credits ' putative over-reporting and false reporting ' of pit bull attacks on humans as a major cause for their public perception			2
@entity216 : mr @entity11 ( pictured with @entity9 ) hopes he can get people to see the breed in a new light , so that more pit bulls can enjoy happy endings in fact , it 's the human attacks on what many insist to be a naturally gentle breed that perhaps need addressing ; attacks mainly in the form those who abuse pit bulls , use them as ' bait ' and force them into cruel dog - fighting rings			1
mr @entity11 points to the case of @entity234 , the @entity235 quarterback who was jailed in 2007 for mistreating pit bulls as part of vicious dog - fighting racket			1
almost all of mr @entity234 's former fighting dogs were placed in family homes after positive training rehab , he reveals			0
at the end of the day , the not a @entity3 campaign simply hopes to shine a very different light on this little - understood breed , so that more pit bulls can enjoy happy endings			1
you can donate or help the cause here .			0
