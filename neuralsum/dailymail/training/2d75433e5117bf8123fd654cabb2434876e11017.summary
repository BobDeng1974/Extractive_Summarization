by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 22 may 2013 these incredible images show the moment a fearless diver gets up close and personal with one of the most dangerous sharks in the world			1
@entity7 not only swam alongside bull sharks without a cage , he even coaxed them to open their mouths so he could feed them fish			1
@entity15 has been swimming with the bull sharks near to his home in @entity18 , @entity19 for several years			1
feeding frenzy : @entity21 diver @entity7 gets so close to a bull shark he is able to feed fish directly into its mouth steady nerves : the bull shark is one of the most feared species and is responsible for the majority of attacks on humans and remarkably he has now come to know the creatures so well he considers them as his friends and has them quite literally eating out of the palm of his hand			1
these images were taken by photographer and freediver @entity40 who joined @entity15 on one of his many dives in a bid to show a different side to the usually feared creatures			0
@entity40 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' on this particular trip we were in @entity19 documenting and shooting the bull sharks in support of conservation efforts to protect the pregnant females that move through to give birth in the area			1
' i work with several different species of sharks and never feel scared while in the water with them , or are in close proximity to them			1
' in fact i consider it a gift to get close to the animals , as they are typically so shy and afraid of divers			0
' @entity15 loves the bulls that come through @entity18 like they were his own children			0
' he has worked diligently to protect the pregnant females that move through the area			0
' many of the sharks he works with year after year and he has grown to know the individual sharks and their distinct personalities very well			1
daredevil : the bull shark reveals an array of razor sharp teeth as he swims inches from the camera calm and collected : @entity85 says that he has become completely comfortable with the bull sharks which swim near his home in @entity18 in @entity19 ' @entity89 are typically very timid and shy of scuba divers , to capture the open mouth images the @entity15 has to lead the bait into the camera lens			1
' we wear special chainmail suits to ensure we 're protected from accidental bites as the shark moved in to collect the bait			0
' feeding of sharks is only done by highly trained professionals who utilize protective gear , such as the chainmail suits , in order to protect both the shark and the feeder			2
' professional feeders spend years learning the technique			2
feeding sharks should never be attempted without proper training , equipment and experience			2
' i think in many of the images i 've captured the sharks look like they are smiling			2
' i like having this kind of imagery out there , it helps promote a different side of sharks and helps dispel the myths about sharks			2
' @entity89 are so misunderstood and many species of shark are in serious trouble and need protection			0
' my biggest goal with my work and with my imagery , is to share a side of sharks that most people do n't see , to help others see the beautiful and graceful side that is all too often lost in sensationalised over-the - top portrayals seen in movies , on television and in books			0
' i hope to show a different perspective to sharks , show they can peacefully and beautifully interact with divers underwater , that there is grace and beauty in them			0
' i want people to see the sharks the way i see them , with love and admiration			0
