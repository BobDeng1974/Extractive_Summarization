@entity0 is not the only player prone to violent reaction after being hit by a bad tackle , as this video of @entity6 midfielder @entity4 proves			1
the @entity8 midfielder has not featured for relegation - threatened @entity9 since suffering a knee injury on november 19 , and has been easing his way back towards full fitness			1
but @entity4 's return from injury took a dramatic twist when he was sent off for violent conduct while playing for @entity6 's under 21 side on monday			2
with clear echoes of @entity0 's sending off for @entity19 against @entity20 on saturday , @entity4 earned himself a red card for retaliating to a bad tackle on him towards the end of the game against @entity25			1
referee @entity47 failed to show @entity41 a red or even a yellow card , while @entity0 was sent off , much to @entity50 's disgust			2
@entity4 also found himself on the wrong end of a nasty challenge during injury time in @entity6 's 3 - 1 victory			2
cutting in from the right touchline , the 25 - year - old former @entity56 star was felled by a reckless lunge from 17 - year - old @entity33			0
perhaps with the pain of his recent injury still fresh on his mind , @entity4 leapt to his feet and ran back towards the tackler before violently shoving him to the ground			0
as his opponent tried to get to his feet , @entity4 grabbed him by the collar and again furiously shoved the @entity25 youngster			1
unsurprisingly , he was quickly shown a red card			0
@entity69 / @entity68 @entity4 reacted furiously to the tackle and stormed back to confront his opponent and shoving him hard @entity33 was sent tumbling to the floor by the force of @entity4 's shove @entity4 's reaction bore strong similarities with @entity0 's red card for @entity19 on saturday @entity4 grabbed @entity33 by the collar as he tried to pick himself up from the turf the former @entity56 midfielder shoved @entity33 with real force for a second time the referee was quick to brandish the red card and @entity4 trudged off the pitch the incident came just two days after @entity6 captain @entity86 had set a dreadful example to his squad by receiving his marching orders for a below - the - belt punch at @entity92 's @entity91			1
spurs sold @entity4 to @entity6 at the end of last season following a public falling - out with then boss @entity97			0
hailed as a key signing by @entity99 , he has been limited to just nine appearances due to injury			0
@entity99 has since left the club due to health reasons with @entity104 taking over the club 's fight against the drop until the end of the season			0
but @entity4 will not feature in too many more @entity6 games unless he learns to control his temper			0
@entity0 , who will miss the @entity111 final after his own red card , is also finding that out the hard way			2
@entity0 ( second right ) was felled by a studs - up tackle by @entity41 on saturday the @entity43 could not contain his anger and rushed back to confront @entity20 striker @entity117 @entity0 shoved @entity41 after the tackle that @entity50 described as potentially ' career - ending ' @entity41 , who also got away with a nasty challenge on @entity121 , was sent flying by @entity0 's shove @entity0 is restrained by team - mate @entity124 as he stands over the floored @entity41 the @entity19 midfielder 's furious reaction earned him a red card from referee @entity47 @entity4 ( right ) has been restricted to just nine appearances for @entity6 since signing from @entity56			1
