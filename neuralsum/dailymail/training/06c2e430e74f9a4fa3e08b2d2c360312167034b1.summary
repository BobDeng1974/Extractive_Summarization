the mother of a @entity2 citizen who converted to @entity3 after he was kidnapped by the terror group has pleaded with its leaders not to behead her sone			1
@entity8 tweeted a message intended for the @entity11 leadership asking what her family can do to prevent the murder of her son @entity15 , who is now known as @entity16			2
yesterday , a prominent member of a group affiliated to @entity19 called on @entity11 to release the humanitarian aid worker as @entity8 had treated the @entity23 man 's injuries in @entity24			1
please tell us what more we can do that @entity16 may continue to serve and live his life in accordance with the teachings of @entity3			0
' @entity8 , 26 , from @entity44 was captured in @entity24 in october 2013 while working as a humanitarian aid worker			1
his abduction became public after he appeared at the end of the video showing the brutal murder of fellow aid worker @entity33			1
a senior member of an @entity19 - affiliated terror group has spoken out in support of @entity29 - the @entity2 aid worker threatened by the @entity54 following the murder of @entity33			1
@entity56 - a prominent member of the @entity24 - based @entity23 - pleaded with @entity11 to spare @entity8 's life after he identified the @entity58 convert as a medic who helped treat his shrapnel wounds			1
@entity8 is a @entity61 who converted to @entity3 after being captured and taken prisoner by @entity11 in october last year and now calls himself @entity16			1
his life was threatened by the militant known as ' @entity65 ' earlier this month following the sickening filmed beheading of @entity33 - with @entity11 sympathisers last night claiming the terrorists plan to murder @entity8 in the coming days after a wednesday ' deadline ' for the @entity2 to stop bombing them passed			1
@entity8 released her latest plea to @entity11 leadership on @entity74 yesterday stressing her son 's religion mrs @entity8 released the document in both @entity79 and @entity80 in a bid to negotiate with the terror group @entity56 's unexpected intervention came in a series of messages posted on @entity74 , in which he identified @entity8 as an aid worker who ' performed a successful operation under bombardment by the regime '			1
he later explained this operation was to remove shrapnel from his leg			0
he also suggested that @entity8 had treated a number of other fighters linked to the @entity23 - including ' @entity95 ' , who is understood to be one of the regional leaders of the terror group			0
@entity56 went on to suggest that the senior @entity23 fighters had later asked after @entity8 and were surprised when ' he showed up in the video where @entity11 threatened the @entity2 ' as they had wrongly assumed him to be a @entity102 jihadist who had joined their ranks			2
' it later became clear to me that he 's an humanitarian activist that served in @entity108 for more than a year and was then kidnapped by @entity11 , ' the militant said			2
@entity8 's case has exposed deep divisions among supporters of the @entity54 , many of whom have said it would be a great sin to murder a recent muslim convert			2
both extremists who met @entity8 before he embraced @entity3 and former prisoners who were held alongside him have argued that the aid worker 's conversion is without doubt sincere			2
@entity123 's remarks on @entity74 came as @entity11 supporters said a deadline for the @entity2 to stop bombing the terror group in @entity24 and @entity127 had expired			1
they claimed @entity2 citizen @entity8 would now be murdered as a result - a statement that led to a number of arguments among the jihadists and their sympathisers on social media			0
@entity8 was working for aid agency @entity134 when he was abducted by @entity11 in eastern @entity24 12 months ago the 26 - year - old is said to be haunted by a brief spell as a @entity2 army ranger in @entity127 in 2007 and first travelled to the @entity139 to ' give back ' to the @entity140 there			1
in late 2012 , shortly after leaving university , he founded @entity143 ( @entity142 and @entity144 ) - a non-governmental organisation providing humanitarian aid to those in desperate need - and moved to southern @entity148 to oversee the project first hand			0
with funds dwindling , @entity8 continued to make risky ventures into @entity24 by himself - even after a large number of @entity155 were kidnapped by the brutal @entity54			0
he was said to have specialised in providing medical aid to fighters and civilians injured during clashes with regime forces			0
he was eventually seized by the jihadists on 1 october , 2013 while delivering medical supplies to @entity108			0
jihadi @entity65 's promise to murder @entity8 if the @entity2 does n't end its airstrikes has illuminated deep divisions within the jihadist community over how the terror group should have dealt with the situation			2
numerous @entity11 sympathisers have claimed they would no longer support the terror group if they killed @entity8 - a man they consider to be a pious muslim			0
although radical clerics from around the world had pleaded for @entity177 @entity33 's life to be spared due to his aid work , the calls failed to pick up much support within the online jihadist community as he was not as @entity58 himself			1
yesterday @entity183 - born journalist @entity182 - @entity181 - who was born @entity184 but converted to @entity3 while a prisoner of the @entity186 in @entity187 - made a direct plea to @entity11 leader @entity189 to ' do the only right thing ' and stop his followers killing @entity8			2
citing a rule condemning the killing of converts , @entity192 said : ' people have suggested that @entity197 is not informed that some of his followers are planning to murder @entity38			0
' ' that must clearly be the case			0
having studied @entity3 extensively he for sure is aware of how enormous of a sin it would be to murder a brother who just converted to @entity3			0
' in an earlier message to @entity206 said her son ' only seeks to serve @entity209 and the teachings of @entity3 '			0

@entity8 pleaded in @entity79 and @entity80 for her son 's life on @entity74
