fourteen @entity1 troops are being investigated over the death of an @entity4 civilian on board a @entity1 helicopter taking part in a top - secret mission			1
@entity9 was carried unconscious from the @entity11 aircraft and pronounced dead hours later on april 11 , 2003			1
at the time he was being transported between what are described as ‘ illegal prisons ’ in the @entity4 desert			1
the police investigation into @entity18 s death comes just days after the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) launched a ' preliminary examination ' into the alleged torture of @entity4 prisoners by @entity1 troops @entity9 , an odd - job man , was buried without a post-mortem , making it hard to establish a cause of death			1
now , @entity28 has been told how he made a lunge for @entity1 airmen aboard the helicopter and was knelt on for the remainder of the flight			1
the troops being questioned come from the @entity35 which last week was at the centre of a row over photos apparently showing airmen posing next to the dead bodies of @entity42 fighters in @entity43			0
the police investigation into @entity9 ’s death comes just days after the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) launched a ‘ preliminary examination ’ into the alleged torture of @entity4 prisoners by @entity1 troops			1
the @entity19 probe , triggered by human rights lawyer @entity49 , is controversial because the court usually investigates @entity52 dictators who systematically maim and kill civilians			0
on the night he died , @entity9 was arrested by @entity55 @entity54 on suspicion of being an insurgent and handed over to airmen from @entity58 , @entity35 for his transfer to a detention centre			1
fourteen soldiers from the @entity62 are being questioned over the incident in april 2003 @entity9 was led aboard the @entity11 wearing a sandbag over his head and with his thumbs bound together with plastic - cuffs			1
minutes after take - off , he stood up , ripped off his bindings and began swinging his arms aggressively			0
fearing he would make a lunge for one of the machine guns stored on board , the airmen jumped on @entity9 and pressed his body face - down against the floor			1
he was also allegedly punched and kicked			0
when the @entity11 landed at the ‘ secret prison ’ @entity9 was unresponsive			2
@entity1 airmen handed him over to @entity80 troops and his apparently lifeless body was dumped in the back of a @entity84 truck			1
he received no first aid			0
@entity1 personnel were later told he was dead			2
last night a defence source said : ‘ mr @entity9 ’s death was a tragic accident , nothing more , nothing less			2
' as the flight was over hostile territory , the @entity11 was carrying a lot of weapons			0
when @entity9 started behaving aggressively it was imperative that he was subdued			0
' @entity9 could have brought the @entity11 down , killing everyone on board			2
necessary force was used to restrain him , but nothing excessive			0
’ @entity101 are investigating why the airmen failed to administer first aid and why a sandbag was placed over his head – a method of restraining prisoners banned in the 1970s			0
on this occasion the airmen believe they were entitled to @entity110 because the @entity11 was a ‘ sensitive environment ’ and because the whereabouts of these ‘ black ops ’ jails was secret			0
at the time the @entity35 was responsible for transporting suspect insurgents between detention centres in flights so secretive that @entity119 ’ top lawyer in @entity4 , colonel @entity118 , was told nothing about them			2
last night a @entity122 spokesperson said : ‘ as the investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment at this time			0

odd - job man @entity9 died on board a @entity1 helicopter in top - secret mission
was being transported between ' illegal prisons ' in @entity4 desert in april 2003
he ' made a lunge for @entity1 airmen and was knelt on for remainder of flight '
