by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 17 april 2013 it hardly looks like the most comfortable of places to build a home , but these two crows decided to build their nest on top of a yacht 's mast			1
the pair of feathered home - makers obviously took the nautical term quite literally when they decided to make good use of the ' crow 's nest ' of a vessel moored at @entity17 harbour , in @entity18			1
staff at the marina said it is the first time they have seen an actual crow 's nest built on the top of a yacht 's mast			1
what a position : these two birds obviously took the nautical term quite literally when they decided to build their home on the crow 's nest of a yacht the crows are understood to have built the nest about two weeks ago , but have only just started sitting in it this week indicating the possibility of eggs			1
as it looks to be a breeding pair , the crows may not yet number enough to be described by their collective name of ' a murder of crows ' but should the eggs hatch , the yacht could quickly become an aviary			0
' why they 'd want to build a nest there is beyond me , ' said @entity49 who works at the marina			1
' there is a little platform at the top but it really does get windy in that spot with the strong north easterly winds			0
bird 's - eye view : staff at @entity17 marina have said it is the first time they have seen an actual crow 's nest built on the top of a yacht 's mast ' i 've never seen anything like it in all my years working down at the marina			1
' the yacht in question is the ' @entity69 ' , which belongs to tal - y - bont couple @entity70 and @entity71			0
the couple suffered from the devastating effects of last june 's flooding and as a result have n't used their yacht because they have been tied up with repairs at their home			2
' that 's probably why they chose it , ' added mr @entity49			2
' we 've had a few ducks making nests on boats over the years but this was a one - off			0
' fingers crossed we might see some chicks , but the danger is then that other birds would continue to use it as a home ! ' @entity95 , from @entity97 ynys - hir nature reserve near @entity98 , said : ' this is a very unusual nesting site in such an open location			2
crows usually nest in trees and bushes which give them some cover and protection			2
' although this site is high enough away from predators , another reason for choosing this spot could be because of easy access to food sources			0
' the recent cold weather means that the breeding season has been pushed back slightly so they might be laying eggs over the next few days			0
' @entity116 : @entity118 's flagship with crow 's nest platforms in @entity120 a crow 's nest in a ship is built in the upper part of the main mast and is used as a lookout point as it provides the best view of approaching land , other ships or approaching hazards			1
early versions consisted of merely a barrel or a basket attached to the tallest mast , but they later became specially designed platforms , including protective railings			0
according to naval legend , the term originated in the practice of @entity140 sailors who carried crows or ravens in a cage at the top of the mast which would be released during times of poor visibility			0
the ship would then follow the crow as it would usually head towards the nearest land			0
scholars however have argued there is no evidence for this and suggest it was first used to describe a barrel platform created by explorer @entity156 in 1807 , which resembled a crow 's nest in a tree .			1
