if you ’ve ever wanted to name part of @entity2 after yourself , now is your chance			0
a @entity6 - based company is giving anyone the ability to give their moniker to one of the red planet ’s 500,000 unnamed craters			1
and , as long as you have a few pounds change in your pocket , you do n’t need to be a scientist or astronaut to take part in the project			0
the world 's most important astronomical authority has slapped down a bid to hawk the names of @entity2 ' craters , saying the red planet is not up for sale the opportunity has been provided as part of a mapping project run by the space - funding company , @entity28			1
the smallest craters , given on a first - come - first - served basis , will set you back around $ 5 ( £ 3 ) with prices increasing based on the size of the crater			1
if all the craters on @entity2 are named , @entity28 will raise $ 10 million ( £ 6 million ) , which it plans to use to fund grants in space exploration , research and education			1
‘ this is the first people 's map of @entity2 , where anybody can play , ’ @entity28 chief executive @entity41 , told @entity42			2
‘ it 's a very social thing ’ the smallest craters , given on a first - come - first - served basis , will set you back around £ 3 ( $ 5 ) with prices increasing based on the size of the crater ‘ we 're developing this grant fund — the @entity28 fund — for people who 've been hit by sequestration			1
‘ there 's nothing like it right now			0
they have no place to go ; it 's either @entity60 , @entity61 [ the @entity61 ] or you 're out of luck			0
’ the company hopes to gain names for other features on @entity2 if it hits its target of naming all the craters by the end of 2014			2
‘ only imagination limits your naming choices , ’ the company writes on their website			0
the @entity74 said the public can get involved in naming of craters when a space agency or the discoverer of a new feature or object asks for ideas			2
craters less than 62 miles ( 100km ) in diameter are named after towns on @entity86 with fewer than 100,000 people			2
craters wider than this are named after late planetary scientists			0
using that scheme , a large crater might someday be named after @entity93 or @entity94			0
one , for instance , has been named after @entity96 , a geologist who spent his career at @entity60 studying lunar and planetary surfaces and the best places for landing			0
‘ names of @entity2 craters in this new @entity2 map can honour individuals , living or deceased , pets , places on @entity86 or in space , sports teams , musical groups , countries , fictional characters - its up to you			2
’ mr @entity41 said the project could provide some interesting insights into what people are thinking about and what ’s important to them			1
duplicate names are allowed in different districts and provinces on @entity2 just as street names in different cities on @entity86 can be the same			0
for each crater you named , an electronic certificate is issued with the name , date and details of the crater			0
the 15,000 red planet features whose names have been approved by the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) will be added into @entity28 's base map			1
however , @entity28 will not get approval from the @entity74 , who is the body that approves the names of space bodies and their features			1
@entity28 's founders said 7,000 craters had been named by people in 78 countries in 10 days			1

@entity28 said project could provide insights into what people find important
craters given on first - come - first - served basis with larger ones costing more
if all 500,000 craters are named , @entity28 will raise £ 6 million ( $ 10 million )
the names will be *unofficial* and there are no plans to have them approved by the @entity74
