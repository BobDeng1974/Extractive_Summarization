men and women have different tastes in art because of biological diversity that was forged in the @entity5 , according to a leading academic			0
and the fact early men and women took on the different roles of hunters and gatherers may explain why just one painting in 200 at the @entity13 is by a woman , says professor @entity15			2
in her new book why men @entity16 and women @entity18 * , prof @entity15 argues that these ancient biological differences mean that men have better rotational and spacial vision because they were responsible for spotting and targeting prey			1
prof @entity15 said only one painting at the @entity13 , pictured , is by a woman as collections are generally chosen by men and each gender tends to like works by their respective sex due to biological differences ‘ some people will be squirming at the suggestion of hunter and gatherer fine - art skills , ’ she says			1
‘ but the way men and women actually see is radically different , thanks to their roles in the hunter gatherer age			0
on average , men ’s eyes are spaced 5mm further apart than women ’s			0
‘ men have better stereoscopic vision , better targeting and rotational skills and can see better in @entity51			0
but at the same time , men are more likely to be colour blind than women			2
men have three colour pigments , which means they can see millions of colours			0
but a substantial number of women have four colour pigments , which means they can see a much greater range			0
’ for this reason , prof @entity15 believes men and women prefer paintings created by their own sex , explaining why great art collections – historically run by men – have only a handful of works by women			1
men prefer works that have darker and fewer colours and are more likely to be drawn to works about inanimate objects , she says			2
by contrast , women prefer more colourful paintings , likely to be about animate things like people and plants			1
prof @entity15 said that men like darker paintings with fewer colours about inanimate objects , while women choose artworks featuring people or plants as they are able to see a greater range of colours			1
