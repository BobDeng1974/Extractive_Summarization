voters believe @entity2 ’s @entity1 is ‘ nice but dim ’ and not capable of taking the tough decisions needed as prime minister , damning new polling reveals			1
the @entity1 leader is seen weaker , less charismatic and worse in a crisis than @entity8 , as pollsters warn he will have to ‘ defy history ’ to take power after just one term in opposition			1
but the most damaging revelation is that voters see mr @entity2 as more like @entity17 ’s character @entity16 than a future prime minister			2
nice but dim : @entity17 's character @entity16 ( left ) was hugely popular in the 1990s , but now voters associate the phrase with @entity1 under @entity2 ( right ) in a withering assessment of the main opposition , voters were asked if @entity1 's ' heart is in the right place and it does not have what it takes to get what it wants done in government '			1
almost a third ( 31 per cent ) of people agreed @entity1 under mr @entity2 is ' nice but dim ' , compared to only 14 per cent of mr @entity8 's @entity32			1
the proportion of people who voted @entity1 in 2010 who now think the party is nice but dim was even higher , at 33 per cent			1
another 10 per cent of @entity1 voters think the party is ' mean '			2
a small majority of people think @entity1 will ' be on the side of people like you ' and will ensure public services provide good value for money			1
but on 10 other measures polled , more people think a @entity1 government would fail rather than succeed , including having the courage to take tough decisions , defending @entity52 interests on @entity53 and immigration and learning from the mistakes of the past			2
voters are most likely to think @entity1 is ' nice but dim ' while the the @entity32 are viewed as ' mean and dim ' mean machine : voters are more likely to say @entity8 's @entity32 are ' mean ' but also think he is more decisive and better in a crisis than mr @entity2 just 21 per cent thought a @entity1 majority government would ' keep their promises ' against 47 per cent who think they would not			1
while the @entity32 also scroe badly on governing in the interests of the whole of @entity52 , not just their friends , and learning from the mistakes of the past , they are well ahead on the economy			0
more than half of people ( 54 per cent ) think a conservative majority government will ' take the right decisions to help @entity52 's economy recove , while just 28 per cent thought they would not			0
for @entity1 , less than a third ( 32 per cent ) thought mr @entity2 would make the right call on the economy			1
with less than two years to go until the general election , voters are evenly split on which main party leader they would like to see in @entity82 after polling day			0
according to the @entity84 survey , when forced to choose 40 per cent opted for mr @entity8 and 41 per cent said mr @entity2			1
two years before the 2010 election , mr @entity8 had a 12 - point lead over @entity87			2
six months before the 1997 @entity1 landslide , @entity88 had a 35 - point lead over @entity91			0
when forced to choose , only 83 per cent of people who voted @entity1 in the 2010 election would prefer mr @entity2 to be prime minister over mr @entity8			1
crucially , less than half of @entity96 voters would want to see mr @entity2 in @entity82 , in a blow to his hopes of wooing supporters disaffected by @entity101 ’s decision to go into government with the @entity32			0
while mr @entity8 's personal ratings have fallen in the last two years , he is still seen as being more decisive , stronger and good in a crisis than mr @entity2 analysis of the way voters view the two main parties reveals @entity1 ’s small lead is more a result of @entity112 unpopularity than any enthusiasm for mr @entity2			1
despite the economy flat - lining under the coalition , just one in three voters think @entity1 would take the right decisions to secure greater prosperity			0
@entity84 ’s @entity120 said : ‘ there is not a single time in more than eighty years when an opposition party has returned to power at the first attempt with an overall majority			0
‘ if @entity2 does head a majority government after 2015 , @entity1 ’s victory will be the first of its kind in modern times , ’ he wrote in an article for @entity128			2
‘ in as far as @entity1 ’s figures look good , this is because so many people think badly of the @entity32 , rather than because of wide public enthusiasm for @entity1			2
’ @entity1 is seen as more likely to keep its promises than the @entity32 , but much less likely to take tough and unpopular decisions labour scores better on being on the side of voters and getting value for money from public services the trials and tribulations of being in power have taken their toll on mr @entity8 ’ ; s personal ratings , and he is now seen as less decisive , strong and honest than two years ago			1
but the prime minister ’s decline has not been matched by any improvement in the @entity153 , mr @entity120 noted			0
two years ago only 36 per cent of voters credited the @entity1 leader with any positive attribute			0
today the figures stands at just 41 per cent			0
mr @entity120 concludes : ‘ overall , the fact that @entity2 has closed the gap with @entity8 has everything to do with the prime minister ’s mounting unpopularity and nothing with @entity2 ’s own appeal			2
’ so far he has failed to convince the public that he would be a competent prime minister who is able to take tough decisions or assure voters that @entity1 has learned from the mistakes it made last time			0
mr @entity2 is warned that he will struggle to win seats from both the @entity96 and @entity32 at the next election			0
predictions that the party will take 14 seats from the @entity96 ' look like a stretch ' , mr @entity120 said .			0

one in three people think @entity1 under @entity2 is ' nice but dim '
@entity2 is more ' honest ' and ' in touch with ordinary people ' than @entity8
but the *pm* is seen as stronger , more decisive and ' good in a crisis '
