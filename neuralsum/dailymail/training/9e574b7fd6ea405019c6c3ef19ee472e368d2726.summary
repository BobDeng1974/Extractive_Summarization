fighting back : @entity1 foreign minister @entity0 has accused @entity2 of stigmatising @entity1 who send child benefit home @entity1 's foreign minister has lambasted @entity7 for saying @entity9 migrants should be banned from sending their child benefits back home			1
@entity0 accused the prime minister of ‘ stigmatising ’ @entity1 by singling out the nation ’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform @entity18 welfare rules			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ if @entity2 gets our taxpayers , should n’t it also pay their benefits ? why should @entity1 taxpayers subsidise @entity2 taxpayers ’ children ? ’ mr @entity7 had said it was ‘ wrong ’ child benefit is paid to support workers ’ families who remain in their home countries			1
under @entity18 rules , child benefit has to be paid to @entity9 nationals who are working in @entity2 and paying national insurance – even if their families are based abroad			1
there are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children , with two - thirds of the children based in @entity1			0
speaking to @entity42 's @entity41 show , mr @entity7 said : ‘ i do n’t think that is right and that is something i want to change			0
’ he warned stopping the export of benefits across the @entity18 would ‘ take time ’ because a deal would need to be struck with other member states or wait for the new treaty he hopes to negotiate if he is still prime minister after the next election			2
he said : ‘ there are other @entity9 countries who like me think it ’s wrong that someone from @entity1 who comes here , who works hard - and i am absolutely all in favour of that - but i do n’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in @entity1			1
’ but today mr @entity0 hit back , writing on @entity69 : ' if @entity2 gets our taxpayers , should n't it also pay their benefits ? why should @entity1 taxpayers subsidise @entity2 taxpayers ' children ? ’ he added : ‘ @entity2 social security rules apply to all resident @entity18 citizens			1
no need to stigmatise @entity1			0
what about @entity2 children abroad ? ’ mr @entity7 made clear that stopping migrant workers in the @entity2 from claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the @entity18 before staging an in - out referendum by 2017			1
@entity7 revealed stopping migrant workers in the @entity2 from claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the @entity18 child benefit is paid at £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for every other child			1
since last year families in the @entity2 with one person earning more than £ 50,000 have had their child benefit cut , and removed altogether if one earner has a salary of more than £ 60,000			2
mr @entity7 said that tackling immigration from @entity9 would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks			2
‘ my job is to put in place proper controls so people ca n’t come here to claim benefits ; to put in proper controls to investigate that people are n’t being paid less than the minimum wage ; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants ; to make sure if people ca n’t sustain themselves , they are removed from our country			0
all those steps we ’ll be taking			0
’ he said he wanted to change @entity2 ’s relationship with the @entity18 before putting it to a vote in an in - out referendum			0
he refused to say if he would campaign to leave the @entity18 if he failed to secure enough concessions , insisting his renegotiation was ‘ doable ’			0

@entity7 said it is wrong @entity9 workers in @entity2 can send benefits home
he singled out @entity1 where two thirds of all child benefit is sent back
