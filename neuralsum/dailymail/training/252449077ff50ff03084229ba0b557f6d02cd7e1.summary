fresh details have emerged about last month 's sickening filmed beheading of 22 @entity3 soldiers by a group of international killers fighting for the @entity6			2
operational details , such as the expense of the professionally produced and edited footage , how long the film took to shoot , and exactly where it was filmed were uncovered by @entity13 and @entity14 researchers who spent weeks extracting clues from the 16 - minute long video clip			1
the propaganda video , titled ' though the @entity18 despise it ' , was known to have been filmed in the religiously symbolic town of @entity20 in @entity21 , and also showed the severed head of captive @entity14 aid worker @entity23 , who was apparently murdered off screen			2
however , experts from @entity26 ( @entity26 ) and @entity13 - based counter-extremism think tank @entity29 believe they have now pinpointed they exact stretch of desert in which the savage murders took place			2
they also raise a number of questions about why non-speaking militants are seen wearing microphones , why some militants are filmed at the start of the video but not later , and bring to light new evidence suggesting @entity45 ' killer - in - chief ' @entity43 ' may have been played by a body double			1
close analysis of shadows and the direction of sunlight suggests that scenes that appear to have been shot without pause were in fact broken up and filmed over a number of hours			1
this is likely to have been in order to re-shoot scenes if , for example , one of the murderers made a mistake in the heavily choreographed sequences captured before the murders actually take place			2
the experts believe the 16 - minute long video would have cost @entity45 approximately $ 200,000 to produce , such was the sophistication of the editing equipment required and the quality of the multiple hd cameras needed to produce such a slick and professional piece of propaganda			1
despite the money spent , basic continuity errors have crept into the film - including militants and prisoners standing in a different order in apparently successive scenes			1
the frame - by - frame analysis also revealed several moments where @entity45 militants are seen in the background of the clip standing around and talking - apparently killing time before being called to take part in group filming			1
@entity107 : although friends and neighbours say this man is @entity112 - a 28 - year - old notorious @entity107 @entity114 extremist from the town of @entity116 - his identity has not been formally confirmed mystery : in fact the mayor of @entity116 , the town where @entity112 lived before travelling to @entity21 in 2012 , said @entity112 ' is not at all in the video ' , adding that claims to the contrary are ' completely wrong ' mystery still surrounds identity of killers other than the killer known only as @entity43 , all of the @entity45 militants who appear in the murder video are seen with their faces uncovered , making no attempt whatsoever to conceal their identity			1
despite this , only one of the terrorists featured has been formally identified - 22 - year - old @entity137 @entity136 , who friends described as a mild - mannered former @entity139 who used to sell scooter parts in @entity142 until his conversion to @entity114 at the age of 17			1
although the names of a second @entity137 , @entity147 , and @entity107 national @entity112 have been put forward as other suspected executioners , official confirmation has not been given by either government			0
in fact the mayor of @entity116 , the town where @entity112 lived before travelling to @entity21 in 2012 , said @entity112 ' is not at all in the video ' , adding that claims to the contrary are ' completely wrong '			2
' we do n't recognise anyone from @entity116 in it , ' @entity153 said			0
' i can be sure 99 per cent that no - one from @entity116 is in it , ' he added			2
another name put forward as a suspect was @entity162 medical student turned @entity6 militant @entity163 , 20			2
however video experts ruled that although the man in the clip resembles @entity163 , there are subtle facial differences that suggest they are not the same person			1
meanwhile @entity171 sources familiar with the movement of @entity45 militants in @entity21 and @entity174 also identified one of the men as a @entity178 national			2
since the release of the footage , analysts from @entity13 , @entity137 , @entity180 , the @entity14 , the @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 have been poring over the footage to try and put names to faces			2
unconfirmed : although the name of a second @entity137 , @entity147 , have been put forward for this @entity6 executioner , official confirmation has not been given by the @entity137 government callous : @entity171 sources familiar with the movement of @entity45 militants in @entity21 and @entity174 identified this unnamed killer from the latest @entity45 beheading video as a @entity178 national was @entity43 played by a body double ? within minutes of the @entity3 soldier murder video being released , experts began questioning whether the ' @entity43 ' who appears in the footage is the same person as the militant who savagely cut off the head of @entity14 journalists @entity205 and @entity207 and @entity13 aid workers @entity208 and @entity210			1
these questions were largely raised by reports that the militant had been seriously injured or perhaps even killed by an @entity14 airstrike only days before the footage was shot			1
viewers pointed to the fact the militant looked slightly shorter than in other beheading videos , and appeared to have put on weight - leaving him with a slight paunch that was not previously visible			1
however @entity26 and @entity29 's research has suggested another clue backing up the claims that more than one person may be ' playing ' the role of @entity43			1
in one split - second scene , the experts have identified a second man wearing @entity43 's distinctive black mask and matching uniform standing in the background of a sequence in which @entity45 ' executioner in chief is also clearly pictured			1
one theory is that , with the terror group 's leadership the prime target for @entity14 - led coalition drone and airstrikes , several men may be pretending to be the militant in the hope of creating a few moments of confusion that could help save the real @entity43 's life			1
in the sickening video a group of @entity3 soldiers are marched to their execution site by @entity6 militants where the murders took place : the location of the killings has been confirmed as a desert road in northern @entity20 that was previously identified in this image from activist group @entity259 is being slaughtered silently location of video identified as desert road in northern @entity20 the @entity3 soldier murder video titled ' though the @entity18 despise it ' was released through official @entity6 media tagged with a note claiming the video was shot in the town of @entity20			1
now the exact location has been confirmed as the same stretch of desert running parallel to a road in the north of the town that had previously been identified as the location by @entity277 activist group @entity259 is being slaughtered silently			0
the resistance group produced a map to show the location in the northern suburbs of the small but highly symbolic @entity3 town of @entity20 , north of @entity283			0
the terror group 's de facto capital is @entity259 , where previous filmed murders featuring the militant known as ' @entity43 ' are understood to have been filmed			1
the @entity45 video featuring the brutal filmed murder of @entity3 soldiers was shot in @entity20 - an area of increasing symbolic importance to @entity6 terrorists			1
as well as naming their @entity301 propaganda magazine after the small desert village , a 1,300 year old prophecy predicting @entity295 as the location of an apocalyptic battle between @entity298 and an ' infidel horde ' is understood to be fueling the warped imaginations of the fanatics			0
the town , which is in @entity283 province , was captured from the @entity308 in august and prompted streams of highly romanticized propaganda in which @entity45 militants identified it as the first step towards ushering in the @entity313			0
a key feature of this prophecy involves attracting the ' infidel horde ' into @entity315 for a huge ground battle			0
@entity45 has even named its official magazine , which reinforces its extremist views , ' @entity295 ' ( two editions above ) it is notable that in the latest sickening video , the militant known as @entity43 is now urging @entity13 and @entity14 to send their troops to fight in @entity21 , rather than to leave the @entity6 alone as he had done in previous videos			1
' here we are - burying the first @entity14 crusader in @entity295 ... eagerly waiting for the remainder of your armies to arrive , ' he says			0
the 1,300 - year - old hadith , which is a report of the deeds , teachings and sayings of the @entity336 , refers to the ' horde ' flying 80 banners as they take on a @entity114 army in the @entity3 town of @entity20			0
it warns of a ' malahim ' - the equivalent to @entity343 in @entity345 teachings â€“ in which the @entity298 ultimately prevail			0
@entity45 supporters on social media have started comparing recent developments in @entity21 to the prophecy amid warnings the ' malahim ' is coming			0
@entity6 fighters are said to have drawn on the prophecy even more so since conquering @entity295 in august and the town 's name has become a byword for the struggle against the @entity358			0
the terrorist group has even named its official magazine ' @entity295 ' , in which it pushes its extremist views and reports victories			0
supporters appear to be convinced of the prophecy 's validity , with one writing on @entity367 : ' @entity295 will happen for certain ... the @entity14 and its allies will descend on @entity21 once they see that the air campaign has failed			0
that is a promise by @entity372 and his messenger			0
' another , from @entity375 , wrote			0
' the lions of @entity114 have raised the banner of the @entity378 in @entity295			0
now they await the arrival of the @entity382 army			0
' @entity383 , a fellow at the @entity384 , said the hadith is heavily relied upon by @entity45 because it ' raises morale '			0
he said : ' it is fair to assume that the vast majority of ( @entity45 ) fighters believe in this type of talk			0

researchers spent weeks analysing beheading video in minute detail
broke footage down frame - by - frame looking for clues about its origins
shadow and light analysis suggests video was shot over several hours
also identified scenes where subtle edits and *retakes* have been *inserted*
split - second scene shows man standing with ' @entity43 ' in same clothes
raises suspicion that militant may have body double who acts as decoy
