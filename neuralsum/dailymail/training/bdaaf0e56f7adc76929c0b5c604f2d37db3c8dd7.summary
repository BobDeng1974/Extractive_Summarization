@entity0 admits he told @entity1 to use cheese to nurse his knee injury , but the former @entity5 manager remains adamant the allegations are ' laughable '			1
@entity0 , sacked on thursday with @entity5 currently bottom of the @entity8 , believes the accusations are because @entity1 is ' not performing on the pitch ' and ' not in the spotlight '			1
despite it being @entity15 who confirmed @entity1 was told ' to put a lump of cheese soaked in alcohol on his thigh and to leave it overnight ' on @entity20 , the @entity13 manager aimed his retaliation at the now - @entity23 player in question			2
@entity0 lasted just 18 games in charge of @entity5 before being sacked by the @entity8 strugglers @entity1 was advised to put cheese on his injured thigh to speed up the healing by @entity0 20 - @entity31 ( @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ) 21 - @entity36 ( @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity37 , @entity38 ) 22 - @entity39 ( @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity37 , @entity40 ) 23 - @entity41 ( @entity32 , @entity42 , @entity37 , @entity43 ) 24 - @entity5 ( @entity32 , @entity42 , @entity44 , @entity45 - 1pt ) ' ( @entity1 's ) portrayal of what was actually said , is so far from the truth , that it becomes laughable , ' @entity0 wrote in a 300 - word post on @entity50			1
' he had an injury to the knee ( inflammation ) and i mentioned that he could try using an old technique of wrapping the knee with quark , which is used to decrease the inflammation			2
' i would never tell a doctor how he should manage the injury to a player , but it seems that this story has been wrongly told and blown completely out of context			2
' @entity0 , replaced by @entity65 at @entity5 , labelled @entity1 's statements ' completely wrong '			1
he continued : ' it seems to me , that often players who are not performing on the pitch and are not in the spotlight , will make such ridiculous accusations			1
' a world class player in the mold of @entity75 or @entity76 , would never ever make such statements , class speaks for itself			1
' @entity0 says the accusations against his unorthodox methods on @entity1 are ' laughable ' @entity80 gone from @entity5 and @entity0 hit back at his ' apparent tough handling ' of the @entity5 squad and staff , too			2
he added : ' @entity84 a former employee and ex-coach of @entity5 and current coach of @entity88 , who worked with me at @entity5 , stated recently : " i liked @entity0 , he was during my time with him , very good to me			0
" ' it is very important in my profession to be judged objectively , as i can imagine all of you would also expect			0
i have no problem with constructive criticism , but malicious gossip just goes too far in my opinion			0
' and i will most certainly defend myself against a defamation of character , which is put out to damage my reputation			0
' @entity5 currently sit bottom of the championship , having lost seven of their eight matches so far , drawing the other			0
@entity1 joined @entity109 outfit @entity23 during the summer on a free transfer			0
@entity65 has taken over at bottom - of - the - @entity5 after @entity0 's recent departure			0

@entity0 : ' he had an injury to the knee ( inflammation ) and i mentioned that he could try using an old technique of wrapping the knee with quark '
@entity0 says @entity1 's statements are ' completely wrong ' after @entity15 *revealed* the *unusual* remedy on @entity123
@entity0 : ' it seems to me , that often players who are not performing on the pitch and are not in the spotlight , will make such ridiculous accusations '
@entity0 on @entity50 : ' a world class player in the mold of @entity75 or @entity76 would never ever make such statements , class speaks for itself '
