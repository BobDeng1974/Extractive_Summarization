@entity0 , who has been in charge for just over a year , locked his players in the dressing - room at @entity11 for an hour after witnessing an abject performance			1
the defeat means @entity2 have won only twice in the last 22 games , and their fans rounded on the 51 - year - old manager by chanting : ‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ’			2

‘ i said when i first took the job that it was going to be tough , but i did n’t expect it to be this tough , ’ he admitted			2
‘ i ’ve never seen a team capitulate as badly as that			2
i ’m absolutely fuming because as a player i never gave a performance like that			0
‘ they did n’t look like a @entity2 team or my team			0
they did n’t have any fight in them and that ’s what we ’ve just been talking about in there			0
i did n’t know what they doing or where they were going			0
i do n’t blame the fans after that			0
all i can do is apologise to them			0
’ the speculation over @entity0 ’s future came at the end of an eventful third - round replay that saw @entity24 sent off in the sixth minute , seven players booked and @entity3 manager @entity104 and his assistant @entity105 both sent to the stands by referee @entity107 following a brawl in the first half			1
it erupted when @entity3 striker @entity18 chased a ball to the touchline and was sent crashing into the advertising hoardings by a push from @entity116			1
@entity2 keeper @entity49 appears to punch @entity3 striker @entity25 during the feisty @entity23 clash @entity49 is the centre of the mass touchline brawl between the @entity3 and @entity2 players at @entity11 coaching staff intervened as both sets of players became embroiled in a nasty brawl in the first - half both sets of players and members of the coaching staff became embroiled in the melee , with @entity2 goalkeeper @entity49 particularly lucky to avoid being sent off after he appeared to aim punches at @entity25 and @entity36			1
@entity104 said : ‘ i thought it was a dangerous challenge because there ’s a wall just behind the advertising boards			0
‘ me and @entity105 reacted			0
i was trying to make sure there was no brawl but it certainly was n’t to instigate anything			2
the ref said it was for leaving the technical area			0
‘ you can get a yellow card for trying to injure an opposing player but me and @entity105 got sent to the stands , which is a bit harsh			2
i apologised to the boys at half - time because i asked them to keep their cool and stay on the pitch , and in the heat of the moment i reacted to a dangerous challenge			1
‘ we ’ll have to take that on the chin and i ’m glad it has n’t ruined a great night			0
’ @entity20 went three goals ahead before half - time after @entity52 was shown a straight red card for dragging @entity18 to the floor as he raced clear on to @entity30 ’s through ball			1
they took the lead two minutes later when @entity30 headed @entity48 ’s cross to the far post where @entity18 was lurking to score from close range , and doubled their lead when @entity31 headed down a free - kick from former @entity7 and @entity2 winger @entity33 for @entity38 , who had far too much time and space to fire home from 10 yards			1
@entity48 then turned in a cross from @entity33 six minutes before half - time and @entity36 added a fourth in the second half to book a trip to @entity177 that will be worth an estimated £ 500,000			1
‘ there was a big prize at stake , ’ said @entity104			0
‘ it ’s quite a considerable amount when you consider our overall budget			0
’ @entity3 manager @entity104 and his assistant @entity105 were send to the stands for their part the @entity3 celebrate with second goal scorer @entity25 ( bottom right ) during the win at @entity11 @entity25 of @entity3 holds off a challenge from @entity58 and @entity56 of @entity2 @entity48 was in the right place at the right time to fire in @entity3 's third against @entity194 @entity2 the @entity2 players look dejected having conceded a fourth goal to @entity4 side @entity3 @entity2 manager @entity0 looks despondent after his side were thrashed 4 - 0 at @entity3			1
