the devastating invasion of @entity2 land that bulldozed the indigenous population into relative insignificance has been visualized in a striking time - lapse map			1
between 1776 and 1887 , white conquerors razed across 1.5 billion acres of occupied land , claiming it for their own			1
by 1800 , @entity9 only accounted for 15 per cent of the nation , compared to the settlers ' 85			0
@entity12 provided by @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 how it started : the settlers started on the @entity18 and headed west through the center , the video shows just the beginning : within 30 years , almost 200 million acres had been seized from the indigenous people a survey taken in 1900 showed the @entity24 to make up just 0.5 per cent of the @entity26 population			1
it is a history that many claim to be ignored by the majority of non-indigenous @entity9 , who focus on the lives lost during the @entity31 and @entity33 atrocities of the 19th century			0
attempting to bring the scale of land and lives lost , dr @entity13 , of the @entity15 , created a @entity37 video mapping the dispossession			1
' few [ @entity9 ] can recall the details and even fewer think that those events are central to @entity26 history , ' dr @entity13 wrote in an accompanying article for @entity44			2
the video was put together by @entity15 professor dr @entity13 to promote awareness gradual : in the first 100 years , the settlers largely swept the east and south as they focused on other issues ' their tenuous grasp of the subject is regrettable ... and deplorable			1
' the video shows how settlers started their onslaught in 1776 from the @entity18 and through the center - tennessee , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity54			2
it was a gradual process : by 1860 , there was still a significant faction of indigenous land across the west half of the country			0
in 20 years , that was almost entirely annihilated			0
dr @entity13 explains the ' rapid and murderous ' sweep by quoting @entity68 's first governor @entity67 : ' that a war of extermination will continue to be waged between races , until the @entity24 race becomes extinct , must be expected , ' @entity67 said in 1851			1
east gone : in the years leading up to the @entity31 , virtually the entire east half of @entity26 was occupied reservations : half way through the 19th century we start to see the first reservations popping up the onslaught : after the civil war was a ' rapid and murderous ' rampage across the @entity80 plans : after the settlers discovered @entity68 's gold , officials vowed to stop at nothing to control the land ' @entity33 ’s 20th century atrocities are easier for most people to envision than the dispossession of @entity9 , ' dr @entity13 writes			1
' accounts of those episodes describe the victims as men , women and children			0
' by contrast , the language used to chronicle the dispossession of native peoples – " @entity24 " , " chief " , " warrior " , " tribe " , " squaw " ( as native women used to be called ) – conjures up crude stereotypes			2
' in the 21st century , the canvas is being stretched for a change of perspective			0
now , more than one per cent of @entity9 identify as indigenous - ' an increase , ' dr @entity13 writes , ' that reflects not a substantive demographic shift but a newfound willingness and desire to identify as indigenous			2
' virtually obliterated : by 1887 , 1.5 billion acres of land had been taken and the population vastly diminished in 2010 , the map of @entity26 's reservations had since diminished , though more identify as indigenous now while the @entity119 recognizes reservations as possessing a nationhood status and inrehent powers of self - government , dr @entity13 calls for more universities to teach indigenous history as a matter of course			1
he concludes : ' a history that glosses over the conquest of the continent is partial , in both senses of the word			0
' it misleads people about the past and misinforms their debates about the present			0
' in charting a course for the future , @entity9 would do well to put the dispossession of native peoples back on the map			0

settlers conquered 1.5 billion acres between 1776 and 1887 from @entity24
@entity15 professor dr @entity13 claims this is *n't* studied enough
he has mapped the dispossession in a striking time - lapse video
