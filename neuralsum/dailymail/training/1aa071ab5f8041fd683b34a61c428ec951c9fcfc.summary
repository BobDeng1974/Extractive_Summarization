by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 17 march 2013 technology companies see passwords as an outdated security risk as consumers often forget the increasingly complicated combinations and criminals break the codes it 's a bane of modern life remembering the myriad of passwords vital for everything from smartphones to bank accounts and online shopping			1
this tedious task , however , is set to be a thing of the past as other methods are developed			0
these include using fingerprint , voice and facial recognition instead of passwords seen as an outdated security risk			1
@entity26 is among several companies preparing to turn to fingerprint recognition			1
it is said to be releasing a new @entity30 allowing owners to identify themselves by pressing a finger onto the handset			0
the technology could eventually spread to allow access to bank accounts and email accounts			1
@entity38 , maker of @entity40 phones , is examining voice recognition , iris scanners , behavioural biometrics and heartbeat reading			2
@entity45 , head of security at @entity47 , said : ‘ it ’s a case of looking beyond passwords and the best alternatives are provided by smartphones			2
‘ the general view is that @entity26 will launch a fingerprint - enabled @entity30 before the end of the year			1
‘ the @entity40 handset market intends to stay competitive so it ’s highly likely there will be fingerprint and voice identification - enabled devices from them too in the near future			0
’ @entity26 has bought a firm forging ahead in fingerprint identification technology and has submitted a patent for a biometric sensor			1
forward thinking : @entity26 is expected to release the @entity65 this summer followed by the @entity30 6 later in the year some smartphones already have voice recognition software and around a fifth have facial @entity70 capabilities , including the @entity71 research into passwords by @entity74 in 2007 suggested that the average person used 6.5 passwords for 25 sites			1
the number will have increased massively since the study			0
’ mr @entity80 , whose firm handled £ 95billion of transactions last year , claims this year is the beginning of a new ‘ experimentation phase ’ for the next generation of smartphones			0
@entity26 has already bought a company which is a market leader in fingerprint identification technology			1
shortly afterwards , it submitted a patent for a biometric sensor			0
the company is expected to release the @entity65 this summer followed by the @entity30 6 later in the year			0
an @entity94 device is also rumoured to be in production			1
a number of smartphones have already introduced voice recognition software and around a fifth have facial recognition capabilities , including the @entity71 which allows the user to unlock the phone by looking at it			0
but critics point out that the rumoured methods may not work in certain situations			0
they say that voice recognition may not work in a bar or otherwise with background noise and fingerprint technology may not always work			2
@entity111 , director of strategic solutions at @entity113 which manufactures secure identity technology , said the only way round the problem was to combine methods			0
‘ if you ’re trying to access your account in a noisy bar , instead of using voice recognition , you could switch to facial recognition using the phone ’s video camera			2
’ @entity26 declined to comment .			2

@entity26 is preparing to *abolish* passwords in *favour* of fingerprint recognition
technology could also be used to access bank accounts and email accounts
an @entity94 device is also rumoured to be in production
