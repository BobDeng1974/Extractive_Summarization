a ringing endorsement from @entity1 is one you cherish			1
that ’s exactly what @entity4 has enjoyed after the @entity8 youngster ’s loan spell at @entity9 has begun with the sort of promise that will have those around @entity13 with more than a little interest			1
@entity1 spoke of @entity15 having a ‘ very good player ’ on their hands and the need to ‘ get the ball to him in dangerous areas ’			1
clearly the @entity23 side see the @entity24 as their catalyst – even after just three games together			2
hardly surprising really , @entity4 has two goals in his first three – including the winner against @entity30 on saturday			1
@entity4 already beginning to make waves down on the south coast			2
hailed by @entity47 as ' the outstanding performer in our reserves ' in the @entity51 , @entity4 handed a @entity52 in the dramatic 3 - 2 win over @entity54			2
@entity8 bought him for £ 800,000 after he had starred for @entity55 during their 3 - 0 victory at @entity57 in the 2011 @entity58			1
@entity4 is a player with the sort of poise and guile in possession @entity47 yearns for – an attacking midfielder with the ability to pick holes in defences , find the net and lay on for others			2
what he does need is regular game time in order to hone his skills ; @entity1 spotted this , got on the phone to former team - mate @entity75 and the player agreed to head south for the season			1
it was slightly surprising that he 'd make the jump to the @entity23 , given he was unable to break into @entity82 's @entity81 promotion team last season			0
but he 's grabbed the opportunity already			0
it 's good to talk ! @entity9 boss @entity1 spoke to @entity75 before sanctioning the loan move @entity8 have invested a significant amount of time and money into nurturing @entity4			1
the signs are that he could become someone with a huge amount to offer in the coming years			0
the @entity93 have always known this			0
former academy director @entity95 sanctioned the original spend from @entity55 in 2012			0
' we knew when we saw him he was one for us and when we got the chance to sign him the manager backed me and we spent a considerable sum for him , ' @entity100 told @entity105 at the time			0
‘ he is going to be a top , top player			0
supporters would n’t mind another one of him .			0
