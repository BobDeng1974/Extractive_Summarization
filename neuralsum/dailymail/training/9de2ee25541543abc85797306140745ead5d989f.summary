chaos : rising numbers of blood donors are being turned away due to bureaucratic errors soaring numbers of blood donors are being turned away without any medical reason - but because of chaos at clinics			1
the number of donors being being sent home as a result of an inefficient system has risen by 40 per cent compared with two years ago , which equates to one in 80 patients - or tens of thousands every year			1
while 10 per cent of donors are turned away for medical reasons , such as anaemia , recent piercings or infections , a further 10 per cent do not donate because of problems with the running of a clinic			2
the figures include people who are told that they can no longer be fitted in because of late - running sessions , sick staff and other problems , as well as those who have to wait so long that they give up and go home , the @entity33 reports			1
@entity34 waits to donate mean that many frustrated donors leave before giving blood			2
it 's estimated that only 4 per cent of people in the @entity39 regularly give blood			1
the problem now means that on average , one donor at every donation session is lost to bad management			1
blood donation bosses say part of the reason for growing inefficiencies is because costs have had to be cut to reduce the price of blood to the @entity52			2
but transplant experts have warned that public faith in the blood donation system will be eroded if the current situation continues			1

but that causes friction , ' he said			0
crisis : blood donation bosses say part of the reason for growing inefficiencies is because costs have had to be cut to reduce the price of blood to the @entity52 ' we know people can get frustrated and i really sympathise			2
[ but ] i do n’t think there ’s any other way we can do it			0
we do all we can to mitigate it but there probably is n’t a better system			0
' but @entity96 , chief executive of @entity97 , said it was ' surprising ' that 10 per cent of donors could not do so for non-medical reasons			1
he said : ' blood donation ... embodies the relationship we have with the @entity52 ; we all put in and we all benefit			0
it undermines that essential public trust			0
' he added that if donors do n't feel appreciated , they wo n't turn up			0
defending the situation , @entity59 said the problem may have been over-estimated , with the rejected donor forms being counted incorrectly .			0
