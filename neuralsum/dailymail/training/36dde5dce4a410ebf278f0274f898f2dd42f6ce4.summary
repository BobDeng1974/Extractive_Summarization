a happy hunting ground for @entity8 trio @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity10 in the past , former @entity4 skipper @entity5 claimed the @entity11 should have plumped for @entity12 to host the crucial @entity14 qualifier , instead			1
a key figure in persuading the governing body to go for the biggest possible capacity , however , @entity0 claims @entity19 ’s home will be transformed into ‘ @entity4 ’ @entity2 for the night			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 speaks to the assembled media ahead of friday night 's game at @entity2 @entity0 ( left ) keeps a close eye on proceedings as his @entity4 side go though their warm - up routine @entity26 ( centre ) leads the way during his team 's training session at @entity2 on thursday ‘ tomorrow , that ’s @entity34 territory and you ’ll know it ’s @entity34 territory , ’ said the national manager			1
‘ there will be 55,000 @entity34 fans in there			0
you ’ll be in no doubt where you are tomorrow			0
you ’re in @entity4 and @entity4 are playing … against @entity42			1
’ denying there is any kind of advantage for key @entity42 figures in playing the match at a venue where some have experienced @entity51 nights first hand , former @entity19 boss @entity0 expects a very different experience this evening			1
@entity55 has been in good form for @entity57 and will lead @entity4 's attack against the @entity8 ‘ it ’s different people , ’ he insisted			2

’ former @entity90 and @entity4 skipper @entity5 disagreed , saying : ‘ if i ’m being honest , this game should have been at @entity12			1
that would have been more of an advantage for @entity4			2
‘ the game is where it is , so we can use that as an excuse or we can use it as a motivation to help us win			2
the stadium does n’t win the game , the players win the game and the performance wins the game , but i think the game should have been at @entity12 to give us a little bit of help			2

‘ we ’re going to get 55,000 @entity129 in there tomorrow , we could n’t have done that anywhere else			0
’ a near 60,000 sell - out , the @entity42 game will draw the biggest home crowd for a @entity4 international in 25 years			1
‘ it ’s a pat on the back for the players that they ’ve generated this interest , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ because , when the game was announced against @entity144 six months ago , that was the big game but it ’s been put on the backburner now			0
