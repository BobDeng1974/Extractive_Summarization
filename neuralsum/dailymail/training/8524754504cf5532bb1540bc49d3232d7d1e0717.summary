by @entity0 doctors inadvertently made @entity5 's condition worse by not putting him on artificial respiration straightaway after his skiing accident , a @entity2 magazine claimed today			1
@entity8 claims the @entity11 star 's supreme fitness could have worked against him in making medics think he was not as gravely hurt as he actually was			1
his condition dramatically worsened in the first few minutes of being airborne in the rescue helicopter , necessitating a stopover in @entity16 - where an opening was cut into his trachea for the respirator pipe - thus tripling the flight time from @entity22 to @entity23 to well over one hour			1
citing a medical source , the magazine said : ' had the airborne rescuers arrived at the scene minutes later they would have recognised that it was a matter of life and death			1
' but they put @entity5 into the helicopter without artificial respiration			0
' @entity5 ( pictured with wife @entity34 ) fell and cracked his head while skiing in @entity22 in december he currently lies at the @entity36 in - a delay which the magazine said was critical to his health			0
the claims come as the racing driver 's devoted wife @entity34 was handed the broken ski - helmet he wore on the day he suffered catastrophic brain injuries			1
it was given back to the family by @entity49 justice authorities on wednesday after they declared their official investigation into the 45 - year - old 's accident on december 29 last year was closed			1
the prosecutor in the town of @entity55 , charged with the probe into @entity5 's low - speed ski accident , declared there was no third party involvement in the tumble which saw the seven times world @entity11 champion smash his head on to rocks			1
' too optimistic ' : a @entity2 magazine claims doctors made @entity5 's condition worse because they misdiagnosed the severity of his injuries which meant he did n't go straight to a specialist unit consequently the helmet - which smashed into three pieces when he plunged on to a rock hidden in snow on the slopes of the @entity49 @entity78 resort of @entity22 - has been returned to his family			1
the helmet - mounted camera he had on together with the rented skis he used at the time of the accident were also returned			2
@entity5 , who spent his 110th day in an artificial coma on thursday , is the subject of a fierce medical debate being played out in the @entity2 media about whether vital time was lost in getting him to the right hospital after his crash			2
@entity94 magazine asked on its website today : ' so what happened in the time between @entity22 and @entity23 ? ' waiting : the @entity97 , where @entity5 has been in an induced coma for three months @entity8 added : ' if it is true , that @entity5 could have been ventilated sooner and operated on sooner , the consequences are potentially dramatic			2
' the outlook for such patients improves dramatically when doctors operate within the first hour after the accident â€” a rule spread among medical professionals			0
' @entity107 will only tell if that was also true in the case of @entity5			0
' so far , @entity5 's manager @entity110 has not commented on the new allegations			0
his management continues to insist that he shows small signs of life , but there is no indication when he will - if ever - fully come around from the coma			2
a spokesman for @entity22 town hall said there would be ' no comment ' on the on - going allegations about the @entity5 case			0
the @entity49 high mountain police referred all calls to the local prefecture , where a spokesman said : ' the matter remains the subject of investigation			0
' he , too , said there would be no comment			0
there was no comment from any of the medics who are treating @entity5 either .			0
