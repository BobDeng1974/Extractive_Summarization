search crews will send a robotic submarine deep into the @entity4 on monday for the first time to try to determine whether underwater signals detected by sound - locating equipment are from the missing @entity10 plane 's black boxes , the leader of the search effort said			1
the crew on board the @entity15 navy 's @entity13 will launch the unmanned underwater vehicle monday evening , said @entity17 , the head of a joint agency coordinating the search off @entity15 's west coast			1
the @entity22 21 autonomous sub can create a three - dimensional sonar map of the area to chart any debris on the seafloor			1
the move comes after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the past two weeks that were consistent with an aircraft 's black boxes			1
prime minister @entity49 raised hopes last week when he said authorities were ' confident ' the four underwater signals that have been detected are coming from the black boxes on flight 370 , which vanished march 8 during a flight from @entity56 , @entity10 , to @entity57			1
but @entity17 warned that while the signals are a promising lead , the public needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews , who are contending with an extremely remote , deep patch of ocean			1
' the search area is new to man , ' he said			2
' i would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the aircraft wreckage - it may not			2
' however , this is the best lead we have , and it must be pursued vigorously			0
again , i emphasize that this will be a slow and painstaking process			0
' officials released this map showing areas they plan to search for the missing jetliner his assessment came after it emerged that @entity10 military investigators believe the missing plane was ' thrown around like a fighter jet ' just after it lost contact with the authorities in a bid to dodge radar			1
flight mh370 is thought to have climbed to heights of 45,000ft - 10,000ft above its normal altitude - before plummeting to just below 5,000ft			1
the plane 's two black boxes , which contain flight data and cockpit voice recordings , have beacons that emit ' pings ' so they can be more easily found , but the beacons ' batteries last only about a month , and it has been more than a month since the plane vanished			1
the @entity15 navy ship @entity13 has been dragging a @entity105 device called a towed pinger locator through the water to listen for any sounds from the beacons			0
over the past 10 days , the equipment has picked up four separate signals			2
the @entity22 sub takes six times longer to cover the same area as the ping locator , and the two devices ca n't be used at the same time			2
it will begin searching an area 5km by 8km and will be launched for a second search 24 hours later			1
crews were hoping to detect additional signals before sending down the sub , so they could triangulate the source and zero in on where exactly the black boxes may be			1
search : a spotter aboard a @entity130 @entity129 plane looks for any debris that could be from the missing plane pilots : @entity134 ( left ) , 53 , and @entity135 , 27 ( right ) were in charge of the plane but it has been 38 days since the plane disappeared , and search crews have n't picked up any new sounds since tuesday , suggesting that the devices ' batteries may now be dead			1
that is why officials will now being using the @entity22 , @entity17 said			0
the submarine will take 24 hours to complete each mission : two hours to dive to the bottom , 16 hours to search the seafloor , two hours to return to the surface , and four hours to download the data , @entity17 said			2
in its first deployment , it will search a 40 - square - kilometer ( 15 - square - mile ) section of seafloor			2
the black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery of what happened to flight 370 after it disappeared with 239 people on board			1
investigators believe the plane went down in the southern @entity4 based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and analysis of its speed and fuel capacity			2
but they still do n't know why			0
meanwhile , officials were investigating an oil slick not far from the area where the underwater sounds were detected , @entity17 said			0
crews have collected a sample of the oil and are sending it back to @entity15 for analysis , a process that will take several days			0
joint effort : a @entity105 @entity181 waits to join the search for the missing @entity10 airliner the ' pings ' were possibly emitted by the @entity10 flight 's black box , which puts a strict time limit on the search , as the black box only has about a month of battery power , and has been missing for a month already working alongside ships and aircraft from seven other nations , the two @entity192 vessels face the same race against time to find the black box flight recorder the oil does not appear to be from any of the ships in the area , but @entity17 cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about its source			1
a visual search for debris on the ocean surface was continuing on monday over 47,600 square kilometers ( 18,400 square miles ) of ocean about 2,200 kilometers ( 1,400 miles ) northwest of the west coast city of @entity208			1
a total of 12 planes and 15 ships would join the two searches			0
but @entity17 said that the visual search operation would be ending in the next two to three days			0
officials have n't found a single piece of debris linked to the plane , and @entity17 said the chances that any would be have ' greatly diminished			2
' ' we 've got no visual objects , ' he said			0
' the only thing we have left at this stage is the four transmissions and an oil slick in the same vicinity , so we will investigate those to their conclusion			0
' the ship is designed for long stays at sea , and could potentially continue its search for up to 60 days also aiding @entity15 vessel @entity13 in the search effort is the @entity234 nuclear submarine @entity235 complicating matters further is the depth of the ocean in the search area			1
the seafloor is about 4,500 meters ( 15,000 feet ) below the surface , which is the deepest the @entity22 can dive			0
officials are looking for other vehicles that could help to retrieve any wreckage , should the @entity22 find any			0
@entity246 's gloomy outlook will be met with mixed emotions by relatives of the mostly @entity250 passengers			0
some are still clinging to hope that the aircraft has not plunged into the @entity4 and sunk , but has crashed or landed somewhere on land , giving those on board a chance of surviving			0
but other relatives have accepted that their loved ones are lost , but want closure with the discovery of the wreckage and recovery of bodies .			0

search continues - but it is possible plane 's black box batteries have failed
if so , the boxes will no longer be able to release ' pings ' used to locate them
rescuers have deployed bluefin 21 submarine to search 5km by 8km zone
sub capable of creating 3 - d maps of ocean floor to help identify debris
authorities believe flight @entity135 climbed to 45,000ft then dropped to 5,000ft
the *drastic* manoeuvres are thought to be a bid to dodge radar signals
it has been more than a month since the jet disappeared with 239 on board
*international* search efforts continue - and now *include* @entity192 vessel
