by @entity0 the levy is predicted to reduce the number of bags handed out at tills by more than 70 per cent chancellor @entity5 is under pressure to hand over a £ 19million - a - year vat windfall from introducing a 5p charge on carrier bags			1
the @entity10 would be in line to collect 20 per cent vat , or 1p , on the 5p charge , due to come into effect in @entity15 next year			1
the levy is predicted to reduce the number of bags handed out at tills by more than 70 per cent			1
it will also raise some £ 70million a year for green charities , including those tackling litter			0
the vat element would raise £ 19million a year from shoppers , according to the government			2
but the @entity26 , dominated by conservative mps , says today that this sum should be handed back to green good causes , such as cleaning parks and waterways			2
the all - party group of mps also said that plans for the levy in @entity15 have been a ‘ complete mess ’ after ministers proposed several exemptions and red tape rules			0
its report today said : ‘ the vat on the charge should also be spent on new environmental projects and on monitoring the impact of the scheme			1
’ the @entity10 is already collecting vat on the 5p charge in @entity47 , which already has the levy , and will also do so when the scheme starts in @entity48 in october			1
consequently , its windfall from the charge is even higher than £ 19million			2
the introduction of the levy is a victory for the @entity52 ’s @entity54 campaign			0
chancellor @entity5 is under pressure to hand over a £ 19million - a - year vat windfall from introducing a 5p charge on carrier bags more than eight billion disposable bags are used in @entity15 each year , or 130 bags per person			1
for @entity47 , this fell to 22 after the levy was introduced in october 2011			2
its scheme is simple in that all retailers , regardless of size , charge a 5p levy on all single - use carrier bags			1
but ministers insist that in @entity15 there should be no 5p charge for biodegradable or paper bags , and small shops – those employing fewer than 250 people – will be exempt			1
the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) says this is to reduce the regulatory burden on small shops			0
but the @entity79 , which represents small shops , said its members would be happy to apply the levy			0
@entity26 chairman @entity82 mp urged ministers to ‘ keep it simple to help shoppers do the right thing ’			0
current government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in @entity15 until october 2015 at the earliest she added : ‘ ministers have managed to make a complete mess of their planned carrier bags charge by making it unnecessarily complicated			1
’ the committee said there is no value in exempting paper bags because they can have a greater impact on the environment than plastic versions			0
miss @entity82 added : ‘ biodegradable bags are not as green as they sound			0
we heard they can do as much harm to wildlife as normal plastic bags and could cause big problems for the @entity109 recycling industry			0
’ dr @entity110 , of the @entity111 , said the plan to exempt small shops , paper and biodegradable bags was ‘ ludicrous ’			0
but a @entity77 spokesman said : ‘ paper bags make up only a small proportion of carrier bags and break down naturally			1
biodegradable bags will only be exempt if they are genuinely biodegradable – currently such a bag does not exist			2

the @entity10 would be in line to collect 20 per cent vat , or 1p , on 5p charge
