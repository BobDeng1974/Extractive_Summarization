@entity1 's chief medical officer , dame @entity2 is urging the @entity3 to approve an historic law allowing the creation of @entity7 babies using dna from three different people an historic law allowing the creation of in @entity7 babies using @entity8 from three different people would give thousands of families hope , @entity1 's chief medical officer said today			1
dame @entity2 is urging the @entity3 to approve the landmark law , ahead of a debate on the subject			1
mps voted earlier this month in the @entity18 to legalise the controversial mitochondrial donation technique , which critics say will lead to ' three parent babies '			1
if the @entity3 gives the go ahead - which seems likely - @entity22 will become the first country in the world to permit the procedures , aimed at preventing serious inherited mitochondrial diseases			1
opponents , including church leaders and pro-life groups , have warned that the change has been brought about too hastily and marked the start of a ' slippery slope ' towards designer babies and eugenics			1
but chief medical officer dame @entity2 said she believes the @entity3 should vote in favour of the amendment to the 2008 @entity37			1
scientists at @entity39 have developed a way of swapping the mother - to - be 's diseased mitochondria – the ' batteries ' that give cells energy – with healthy ones from another woman 's egg			2
@entity48 said : ' i want them to consider in the @entity3 what this is			1
it 's quite separate from the illegal act of changing @entity8 in the nucleus			0
' it would give these women their own children and these families hope , and i believe this is right			1
' we have a very strong regulatory system that would regulate first the service and secondly would review every individual case before they could happen			1
' the government 's most senior health advisor admitted if the treatment fails there would be an increased miscarriage rate , but added that there was ' no expectation of that '			0
critics have pointed out no clinical trial has taken place to show conclusively that the treatments are safe in humans			2
however , three separate expert reviews for the @entity79 found that the technique is ready to go forward			0
dame @entity48 said : ' the only clinical tests you can do are either in rats , mice and monkeys - and those have been done - or in humans and the mothers now want to do this following those three scientific reviews			2
' i would n't call it a test , but the first cases will be scrutinised very carefully			0
' she also denied the legislation would lead to a ' slippery slope ' giving way to the creation of designer babies			1
however critics argue there is a small risk of diseased mitochondria could be carried over too ( point 4 ) ' this is about changing the battery packs , it 's not about touching the chromosomes that make us what we are , ' @entity48 said			1
' the nucleus is sacrosanct and it is illegal to touch it			0
' there is no debate , nor needs there to be , about touching the chromosome , we are not talking about that , we are talking about mitochondrial transfer			2
' research has shown that mitochondrial donation could potentially help almost 2,500 women of reproductive age in the @entity22 who are at risk of transmitting harmful dna mutations in the mitochondria			1
it is estimated around 150 babies a year could , in future , be born as a result of the technique			2
the child would have ' nuclear ' dna determining individual traits such as facial features and personality from its two parents , plus a tiny amount of mitochondrial dna ( @entity145 ) from an anonymous female donor			1
a free vote in the @entity18 saw 382 mps vote in favour of the controversial technology			0
@entity151 , who voted in favour of the change , said it was not ' playing @entity155 ' but the chance to hep parents have a ' healthy and happy baby '			0
if the change is passed there , it would not become law until october			2
the first baby conceived with the treatment could be born as early as next year			0
the @entity22 scientist who invented the technology welcome the vote			1
after mps voted to legalise mitochondrial donation in the @entity18 earlier this month , a debate will be heard in the @entity3 today speaking following the vote in the @entity18 , professor @entity171 , professor of neurology at @entity39 , said : ' i 'm delighted for patients with mitochondrial disease			1
this is an important hurdle in the development of this new ivf technique but we still have the debate in the @entity3 , and importantly the licensing by the @entity37			1
' finally , i think the quality of the debate shows what a robust scientific , ethical and legislative procedure we have in the @entity22 for @entity7 treatments			1
this is important and something the @entity22 should rightly be proud of			1
' but some 50 @entity190 have written to the prime minister calling for him to withdraw the legislation , which is due to be debated in the @entity3 today			1
meanwhile a group of @entity195 mps have also called on the @entity3 to vote against the plans			1
@entity197 , the former archbishop of @entity198 , said on sunday , that any delay in approving this law would be ' a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation , consultation , parliamentary discussion and scrutiny '			2
he added : ' much opposition is coming from well - organised campaigns from @entity207 from @entity208 and @entity209			0
but if we can not make any alteration , then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions			2
' turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving			0
we live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work			2
' mitochondrial donation would allow @entity7 babies to be born with dna from three different people should the technique be made legal			1
it involves replacing dna in an egg in order to prevent devastating inherited mitochondrial diseases			1
what are @entity235 ? mitochondria are tiny rod - like structures in cells which act as power houses , generating the energy that allows our bodies to function			0
unusually , they have their own dna , distinct from the genetic material within the cell nucleus			2
@entity145 ( @entity145 ) makes up about 0.1 per cent of a cell 's total dna and does not affect individual characteristics such as appearance and personality			1
what causes @entity253 ? harmful mutations in mitochondrial dna can prevent the mitochondria working properly , resulting in a number of diseases some of which can be serious and life threatening			1
they may affect major organs and cause conditions ranging from poor vision to diabetes and muscle wasting			0
how are @entity253 diseases passed on ? children may inherit mitochondrial dna defects from their mothers , but not their fathers			2
people with faulty @entity145 can develop symptoms or be carriers of the condition without experiencing ill - effects themselves			2
what is @entity278 ? defective @entity145 from a mother 's egg can be replaced with healthy @entity145 from a donor			0
this will then prevent the harmful mutations being inherited and passed on to future generations			0
what are the techniques involved ? there are two different procedures , one carried out before fertilisation and the other after			0
@entity291 ( mst ) involves first removing the nuclear dna from a donor egg whose mitochondria are healthy			0
the ' spindle ' of chromosomes containing the mother 's nuclear dna is then taken from her egg and inserted into the donor egg			0
as a result , the donor egg is left with nuclear dna from the mother and @entity145 from the donor			0
this healthy egg is then fertilised and implanted into the mother 's womb			0
@entity308 ( @entity308 ) is similar but in this case the mother 's egg is fertilised first			0
its nuclear dna is then transferred to a fertilised donor egg , containing healthy mitochondria , whose own nuclear dna has been removed			0
this healthy fertilised egg is then implanted			0
@entity318 is @entity278 ? animal and laboratory experiments suggest that the procedures are safe , but no - one can say that the risk is zero			0
three separate reviews by an expert panel convened by the @entity79 and @entity325 have found no evidence that the techniques are unsafe for clinical use			0
critics argue that problems might only arise once the procedure is used to create human babies			1
for instance , replacing @entity145 might have more of an impact on personal traits than had been envisaged			0
unknown epigenetic effects , environmental influences that alter the way genes work , may also have serious consequences for the health of babies , it is claimed .			0

dame @entity2 is urging @entity3 to approve historic law
would make @entity22 first country to allow @entity7 using dna from three people
critics argue it will be start of ' slippery slope ' towards designer babies
but chief medical officer says mitochondrial donation would give hope to thousands of women and families adding she believes the law is ' right '
said rigorous review system would look at every case on individual basis
