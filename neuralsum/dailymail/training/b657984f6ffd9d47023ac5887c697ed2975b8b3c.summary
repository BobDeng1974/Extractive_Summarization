by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 15:38 est , 1 august 2013 more than 2,000 gravestones in @entity3 's @entity2 are marked ' unknown ' - signifying unidentified soldiers who perished in @entity5 when historian @entity7 was hired by the agency tasked with identifying these soldiers in 2011 , he was eager to provide peace for the families with a grave marker of their own to visit			1
@entity7 spoke with @entity14 about his one year at the @entity15 / missing in @entity16 ( @entity17 ) in @entity18 , @entity3 , where he was only met with resistance as he tried to do his job			1
the departed : over 2,000 grave sites in @entity3 's @entity2 cemetery remain unmarked despite the advances of dna testing to identify the lost @entity5 soldiers now the organization is facing criticism from congress after a @entity30 report found that the effort to identify the 83,000 unknown @entity5 soldiers worldwide is ' acutely dysfunctional			1
' commander of @entity17 major general @entity34 will testify before congress today in a hearing on agency mismanagement			1
in one case , @entity7 is ' 100 per cent ' sure who the man is below the unknown grave marker			1
@entity7 was reviewing a 70 - year - old case on ' @entity43 ' a man who was killed in the @entity45 attack on @entity18 on december 7 , 1941			1
the sailor had gone down with the @entity47 , and authorities believes his last name was @entity43 since he had a lighter in his pocket with an engraving of that name			1
that 's when @entity7 realized that the engraving was n't a name , but initials - @entity56 day of infamy : many of the unknown soldiers were lost in the december 7 , 1941 @entity45 attack on @entity18 @entity7 turned his attention to the missing who had those exact initials			1
only two servicemen met that description , and one of them was already identified			2
that left @entity69 , a first - class seaman from @entity70 who was on the @entity47			2
@entity7 reported his find to the @entity72 in april 2012 to disinter the body for dna testing , but the lab still has n't responded to the request			2
they told him to try and get dna from the family			2
' it 's a @entity81			2
you ca n't talk to the families until you 're sure , but how do you become sure until you talk with the families and get the dna ? ' @entity7 said			2
waiting for @entity85 : @entity7 believes he can identify the bodies of @entity87 , left , and @entity88 , right , but the lab in @entity3 has not been helpful he was met with even more outright hostility when he tried to identify soldiers lost on the island of @entity93			1
of the 513 presumed dead from that island , 103 are unknown			0
so he organized the unknowns by physical description : race , age , height , weight , hair color			0
@entity102 , @entity103 - @entity104 @entity105 24 one of the bodies stuck out to @entity7 because he was short			0
anthropologists estimated the soldier was 5 feet 1.4 inches tall , between 23 and 24 , @entity109 and 115 pounds with medium ash - brown hair			0
his pants also showed that he was a second lieutenant			0
only two men could possibly match that height description , and one of them was only a private first class			0
the other , second lt @entity116 of @entity117 was strikingly similar in physical description : 5 foot 3 and a half , @entity109 , 23 , medium brown hair			0
there was no way to be as sure as he was with @entity87 , but it was close enough to confirm with dna evidence			0
again the lab rejected his proposal			0
the first time he submitted his request it was denied for petty mistakes like a comma in the wrong place or because he used footnotes instead of end notes			0
the second time , lab officials said he was ' out of lane ' by using biometrics to narrow down results			0
' we 're in no hurry to identify these individuals			0
they 're not going anywhere , ' was one response @entity7 received			0
an interesting comment considering @entity17 made a goal to crank up identifications to 200 a year by 2015			1
the agency has been averaging 80 or fewer ids in recent years			1
a @entity152 spokesman would not speak about the specific cases of @entity87 or 2nd lt @entity154 with @entity14 , but they did say that the agency has identified seven servicemen in 2013 and has approved all requests by staff this year .			1

there are over 83,000 unidentified @entity5 soldiers buried world wide
the @entity15 / missing in @entity16 has been averaging only about 80 ids a year
the commander of @entity17 is testifying before congress today in a hearing on agency mismanagement
