the two sisters have now waived their right to anonymity , granted under the @entity32 1992 , and spoken out in a bid to help other victims of abuse			1
@entity8 , 24 , said : ' he used to buy me sweets and take me places which was something me and my sister rarely had when he was n’t around			1
i would plead with him to stop , crying , telling him he was hurting me			2
my sister would try to fight him off			2
we both would be screaming but nothing would stop him			2
' the girls were taken into care aged seven and eight			1
both spent the first three years at a children ’s home			1
but their bond was broken when they were separated			2

i felt like i should be abused - i was conditioned in that way			2

she said : ' the police this time have been incredible , if it was n’t for them i would still feel like nobody cared			0
' i hope no little girl or boy ever has to go through what i went through			1
all those people who should have protected us failed us greatly			0
anybody who is aware of a child being abused and does nothing about it is as bad as the abuser			0
more needs to be done so agencies can work together and get closure			0
i feel like @entity10 stole my innocence and social services stole my potential			1
' she went on to say : ' i wo n’t allow him into my heart			0
my life ’s too precious to have something so sick and twisted in it			0

' the judge said there were a number of missed opportunities to stop @entity10 , who was convicted in 1993 of abusing a four - year - old boy jailing @entity10 at @entity171 , judge @entity170 told him : ' these two girls during the 1990s were let down by social services , by the police , and by the @entity28			1
' had their case been dealt with properly , it ’s highly likely that you would have been before the courts many , many years ago and some form of closure may have been available to these two young women a long time ago			2
' the judge said there were a number of missed opportunities to stop @entity10 , who was convicted in 1993 of abusing a four - year - old boy , including a police surgeon examination of @entity9 when she was a young girl which showed evidence of abuse			1
other missed opportunities included a police interview with @entity8 in 1998 in which she told officers her stepfather abused her ; a police interview with @entity9 in 1999 when she again complained of abuse ; and reports from school that the girls were showing symptoms of abuse			1
in each of these cases no action was taken			0

this was an indication of the change in the prosecution authorities			0
that can only be for the better			0
' he added : ' what is clear is that you abused your position as their stepfather			0
you abused the position of trust you had in that family			0
your abuse has had a considerable effect on both these girls			1
you have ruined a large part of their lives			0
' earlier , the court heard how @entity10 would send his wife to the shops to have time alone with the girls , grooming them with sweets			1
@entity237 , defending , said @entity10 had shown genuine remorse for his actions			1

' a decision was made to take no further action against @entity10 in 1999			1
' the recommendation to discontinue the case came from a specialist who advised against the inquiry going further and this was considered at the time to be in the best interests of the victims			2
' if such a recommendation was made to officers today , it would be challenged before an investigation was finalised			0
' when the abuse was reported again in 2011 the case was immediately re-opened and a full investigation commenced			2
this investigation has led to the successful conviction of @entity10			1
' @entity254 has changed the way it investigates crimes against vulnerable people and officers who investigate child abuse and domestic abuse now have a clear structure with dedicated lines of responsibility and ownership			2
' @entity259 said that it would not be appropriate for it to comment on individual cases of this nature it stated that safeguarding children and vulnerable young people has always been a key priority for the @entity259			0
