she spent 19 weeks undergoing treatment at @entity42 in @entity43 ( pictured ) before entering remission and returning home in october 2013 just two months later doctors discovered the cancer had returned in the form of a brain tumour and was also present in @entity7 's bone marrow she is pictured left at the age of seven and right , with her school friends acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is an agressive cancer of the white blood cells			1
the cells , which usually work together to fight infection and repair and reproduce themselves , divide uncontrollably in the bone marrow but do not mature			0
this stops the bone marrow from making healthy blood cells and leads to an increased risk of infection			0
sufferers can become tired and lethargic because of anaemia , which is caused by a lack of red blood cells			0
they can develop bruises and bleeding and feel aches and pains in the limbs			0
@entity27 lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system , which is part of the body 's immune system , made up of organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes			1
lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny tubes and they collect and filter out unwanted bacteria , viruses , damaged cells and cancer cells			0
fluid in the nodes contains lymphocytes - white blood cells that help the body fight disease - and grow in the bone marrow , where blood cells are made			0
lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte b - cells grow in an uncontrolled way			1
patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes			0
if @entity27 lymphoma is in the chest or throat , people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing , whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen , it can cause pain , swelling , nausea and diarrhoea			1
