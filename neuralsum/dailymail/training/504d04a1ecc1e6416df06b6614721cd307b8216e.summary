by @entity0 it has becoming a running joke within the astronomy community - every few months , a new claim is made that @entity5 's voyager craft has passed into interstellar space			1
earlier this month , @entity5 claimed that it has effectively ended the debate , saying the craft had finally , definitely left the sun 's reach			1
however - a new study says that , in fact , that may not be the case - but researchers say they have finally developed a test that could end the debate once and for all			1
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity31 and @entity32			0
after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on @entity37 and intricacies of @entity32 's rings -- the mission was extended			0
@entity41 went on to explore @entity42 and @entity43 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			0
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity46 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity51 's domain and beyond			0
in 2012 , the @entity21 mission team announced that the @entity21 spacecraft had passed into interstellar space , traveling further from @entity27 than any other manmade object			1
now , two @entity21 team scientists have developed a test that they say could prove once and for all if @entity21 has crossed the boundary			1
the new test is outlined in a study accepted for publication in @entity61 , a journal of the @entity63			2
the scientists predict that , in the next two years , @entity21 will cross the current sheet – the sprawling surface within the heliosphere where the polarity of the sun ’s magnetic field changes from plus to minus			1
the spacecraft will detect a reversal in the magnetic field , proving that it is still within the heliosphere			0
but , if the magnetic field reversal does n’t happen in the next year or two as expected , that is confirmation that @entity21 has already passed into interstellar space			1
' the proof is in the pudding , ' said @entity81 , a professor in atmospheric , oceanic and space sciences at the @entity84 in @entity85 and lead author of the new study			2
@entity81 has worked on the @entity21 mission since 1972 and has been a vocal opponent of the view that @entity21 has entered interstellar space			1
he said that , although the spacecraft has observed many of the signs indicating it may have reached interstellar space , like cosmic rays , @entity21 did not see a change in magnetic field that many were expecting			1
the heliosphere , in which the @entity51 and planets reside , is a large bubble inflated from the inside by the high - speed solar wind blowing out from the @entity51 pressure from the solar wind , along with pressure from the surrounding interstellar medium , determines the size and shape of the heliosphere			2

the supersonic flow of solar wind abruptly slows at the termination shock , the innermost boundary of the solar system			0
the edge of the solar system is the heliopause			0
the bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy			2

' this controversy will continue until it is resolved by measurements , ' @entity81 said			0
if the new prediction is right , ' this will be the highlight of my life , ' he said			0
' there is nothing more gratifying than when you have a vision or an idea and you make a prediction and it comes true			0
' the @entity21 and 2 spacecraft were launched in 1977 to study @entity31 and @entity32			1
the mission has since been extended to explore the outermost limits of the @entity51 ’s influence and beyond			0
@entity41 , which also flew by @entity42 and @entity43 , is on its way to interstellar @entity159 and co-author , @entity161 , also a professor in atmospheric , oceanic and space sciences at the @entity84 , are basing their new test on a model they developed and published earlier this year in @entity168			1
the model assumes that the solar wind is slowing down and , as a result , that the solar wind can be compressed			0
based on this assumption , the study says @entity21 is moving faster than the outward flow of the solar wind and will encounter current sheets where the polarity of the magnetic field will reverse , proving that the spacecraft has not yet left the heliosphere			1
the scientists predict this reversal will most likely happen during 2015 , based on observations made by @entity21			1
' if that happens , i think if anyone still believes @entity21 is in the interstellar medium , they will really have something to explain , ” @entity81 said			1
' it is a signature that ca n’t be missed			0
' @entity192 of the @entity193 in @entity194 and @entity5 ’s @entity195 said ' it is the nature of the scientific process that alternative theories are developed in order to account for new observations			2
' this paper differs from other models of the solar wind and the heliosphere and is among the new models that the @entity21 team will be studying as more data are acquired by @entity21			2

researchers say they have developed a test that could end the debate
believe @entity21 craft could pass into interstellar space in 2015
