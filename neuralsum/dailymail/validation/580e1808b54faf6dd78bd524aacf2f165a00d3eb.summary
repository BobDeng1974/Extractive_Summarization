with mile upon mile of untouched golden beaches , corals reefs ripe for divers , ancient artifacts and a population desperate to impress			1
@entity5 is a country with plenty to offer tourists and it is actively encouraging visitors			1
but unfortunately , the much - desired tourists are not flocking to the east @entity11 outpost , neighbouring @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
for starters , the country does n't exist at all according to the international community , which recognises it only as part of @entity14 , the troubled nation where piracy is rife and terrorist organisation @entity21 is based			1
locals walk along some of the 528 miles of beachfront in @entity5 that the country is keen to promote although not officially recognised as a country , @entity5 neighbours @entity13 , @entity12 and @entity14 this association with @entity14 is the reason western governments such as the @entity30 and @entity31 call the self - proclaimed independent entity and former @entity30 protectorate a no - go zone , claim locals , but this is n't stopping @entity5 pushing to bring in the tourist dollar			1
official websites proudly proclaim they boast 850km ( 528 miles ) of quiet beaches just waiting to be lazed upon by westerners , while historic landmarks await their long - overdue admiration			2
but the tourists are not flooding in , despite there being numerous means of accessing the nation through neighbouring @entity12 and @entity13			0
as far as @entity5 is concerned , the country has been independent since 1991 and the only thing holding it back is the fact that is n't being recognised globally			1
@entity50 is the director of @entity51 , is keen to add to the handful of eager travellers who defy warnings to visit			0
he laments the slow increase in tourists over recent years - figures differ greatly from a few hundred to more than 1000 last year - due to the ' lack of recognition , ' referring to the wait for the world to acknowledge @entity5 's existence			1
' i believe that as soon we get international recognition the tourists will flock to our stunning beaches			0
the unofficial nation gained independence from @entity30 in 1960 before joining the former @entity72 @entity5 but the countries encountered strife under the rule of dictator @entity76 , whose regime killed tens of thousands of @entity78 due to tribal connection during a brutal civil war from 1988			2
when the @entity82 regime fell in 1991 , @entity5 declared their still unrecognised independence			1
an unspoiled stretch of sand in @entity5 which tourism bodies are keen for westerners to explore tourists are welcome in the unrecognised country , but are asked to respect local customs and dress modestly boats stationed off the coast of @entity94 , the harbour city @entity5 has long relied on for its economy while not great in numbers , tourists do come			1
mostly from the @entity30 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity31 and @entity101 , says @entity50 , who insists @entity5 has something to offer all sorts of travellers , not just those keen to get a genuinely unique stamp on their passport			2
' we have something to offer for all kind of tourists , ' he says			0
' @entity5 have an 850 km coastline with lots of pristine beaches , beautiful coral reefs , unique archaeological sites , rare birds and mammals , fabulous mountain ranges , and a year - round sunny , warm climate , so we are offering a wide variety of tour opportunities that will allow everyone to experience @entity5 in ways that are unique			1
' while @entity126 warnings place the former @entity30 protectorate with @entity14 in the red zone advising against all travel , most experts say the democratically government @entity131 country is among the safest and most peaceful in its region			1
@entity50 says emphatically that any perception that @entity5 is dangerous is ' wrong '			2
' that â€™s actually the saddest part , @entity5 has a 0 per cent foreigners / tourists crime rate for the last 10 years , ' he claims			2
a woman sits among her scales awaiting her next sale of vegetables in the market in @entity144 , a city in the northwestern @entity146 province the busy market in @entity5 's capital has a diverse assortment of goods from around @entity11 and the world ' it seems that when you are doing things peacefully and helping yourself , then no one cares about you , ' the acting @entity5 ambassador to @entity12 , @entity153 , told @entity158			2
' @entity5 has been functioning for 24 years , and we 've got lots of places to visit , including 850 kilometers ( 528 miles ) of beaches			1
' the range of figures for incoming tourists in 2014 is warped by some numbers including just foreign tourists while other records include those who had previously fled violence slowly returning			0
@entity5 's advocates are pushing its beaches , culture and history human artifacts such as the @entity177 cave paintings , which are estimated to date back to between @entity178 and @entity179			1
companies including @entity51 ( @entity181 ) and @entity182 , @entity183 are also increasingly eager to squire visitors around its attractions as the country looks to reduce its economy 's long - standing reliance on livestock exports through the port in @entity94			2
' from exploring deserts to taking unique walks through interesting attractions , such as the @entity194 , where you will see cave paintings that are thousands of years old also relaxing on some of the finest beaches on the @entity198 , ' says @entity51 's website			0
@entity200 offers city tours of the capital @entity144 with its markets and famous money lenders , along with @entity205 and @entity206 among others			0
special tours can also be taken to @entity177 , along with the @entity209 and the @entity5 desert			2
a western tourist takes pictures of the @entity177 caves with artwork dating back as far as @entity215 the caves and other historic artifacts are considered some of the most attractive lures for tourists a guide points out a depiction of a cow and explains its meaning on the walls of the @entity177 rock caves a woman displays freshly designed henna tattoos on her hands on the beach in @entity94 @entity94 , the port city the national economy hinges upon , is a major draw with its quiet - meaning largely deserted - beaches and chances to snorkel and scuba dive			1
a lack of infrastructure , however , makes the long stretches of sand not as equipped for tourists as competitors may be , a lure for some but it also means a sometimes unpleasant odour from waste can also be endured			0
@entity5 is also a strict @entity131 community , which may be a turn - off for some westerners enticed by the talk of exotic , deserted stretches of sand given the rules that come with that			1
tourists can fly to the capital @entity144 through the following routes : @entity256 from @entity257 in @entity12 with @entity258 , twice weekly from @entity259 via neighbouring @entity13 with @entity260 and @entity261 , and on @entity262 , who offer three weekly flights from @entity259 to @entity94 and from @entity265 in @entity266 via @entity267			0
by road enter through @entity12 and @entity13 , although it 's cheaper to fly than drive			0
a tax of @entity98 $ 60 is charged on entry			0
visas can be obtained through various means in @entity12 and elsewhere			0
in the @entity30 it 's possible to get a visa on the spot in the @entity278 in @entity279			0
bikinis are banned and a sundowner with alcohol in it is n't an option as it is illegal in @entity5			1
' when swimming , dressing must respect the religion and tradition and the women should dress more conservatively and wear something long , ' @entity50 says			2
visitors are also warned to be careful when taking photographs , especially around military installments			0
on the flipside , dining out is quite cheap with a meal at one of the best restaurants costing us $ 10 and middling meals cost us $ 5			0
@entity50 adds international calls on mobile phones cost us $ 0.20 per minute or less , ' five or six times lower than in most @entity11 countries ' while the tourism companies claim the place is safe , armed guards are sometimes mandatory for tourists or offered			0
many suggest this is motivated more by the fear of what a negative incident could have on the burgeoning industry than the threat of terrorism the @entity126 and other western governments warn of in strongly worded advisories			0
' the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) advise against all travel to @entity14 , including @entity5 except for the cities of @entity144 and @entity94 to which the @entity126 advise against all but essential travel , ' says the advisory for @entity318			1
' any @entity30 nationals in areas of @entity14 to which the @entity126 advise against all travel should leave			1
any @entity30 nationals in @entity144 or @entity94 who are not on essential travel should leave			0
' @entity50 and the people of @entity5 , however , are opening their arms .			0
