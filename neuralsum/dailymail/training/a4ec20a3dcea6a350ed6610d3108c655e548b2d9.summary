there are many archaeological sites in @entity12 , including the @entity70 in the @entity72 residential district that has a towering @entity12 culture pyramid			1
@entity74 , an archaeologist and historian who is director of the private @entity77 museum , said the find at the sports center will add to ' the mosaic and image of the @entity12 culture that is very diffuse ' compared to the @entity84 and @entity85 civilizations that developed simultaneously in other parts of the coast of what is now @entity5			2
unfortunately not much is known of the @entity12 culture , he said , partly ' because the city , the capital , has grown over it			1
' in addition , there has been more interest in the ' pre-hispanic cultures that are outside the metropolitan area : the @entity85 , @entity84 , @entity97 , ' he added			0
