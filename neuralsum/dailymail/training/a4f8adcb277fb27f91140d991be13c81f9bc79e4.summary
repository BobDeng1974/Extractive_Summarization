@entity0 today rejected claims he ' snubbed ' the @entity2 after failing to turn up in the @entity3 for @entity4 's @entity2 today			2
the deputy prime minister spurned the chance to hear the chancellor 's statement in person and instead headed to @entity10 to announce funding for coastal defences			1
@entity14 aides insisted there had not been a behind - the - scenes fall out over the announcement – pointing out that the party had promoted many of the reforms			0
he said : ' we are often told politicians should spend more time outside of @entity37 talking to people and that is exactly what @entity0 is doing			0
this is not a snub			0
' he added : ' i 've spent four years dutifully sitting there on the green benches and this year i thought it would be a nice change to get out of the @entity37 bubble and say what this @entity2 means to people , their families and businesses			0
' the deputy pm decided to stay away from the @entity3 even though the @entity2 's main announcement - overhauling stamp duty - has been @entity14 policy since 2007			1
from midnight tonight , stamp duty will no longer leap at each threshold but will rise gradually , with multi-million pound sales costing much more			2
the stamp duty overhaul will be welcomed by those struggling to get on to the property ladder , or looking to buy a new home just above one of the old thresholds			1
mr @entity0 arrived at @entity67 this morning ahead of the chancellor 's @entity2 but it risks angering those living in more expensive properties worth over £ 1million , particularly in @entity24			1
despite the policy victory a source close to mr @entity0 said there was no point in mr @entity0 being in @entity24			2
he said : ‘ he just sits there so he would rather get out in the country and talk to people about what the @entity2 means for them			0
