’ contrary to popular belief , a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack			1
a cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system			1
it is caused by an abnormal rhythm , or arrhythmia			0
anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning			1
symptoms include unresponsiveness , loss of consciousness , lack of pulse and stopping breathing			0
in contrast , a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart 's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked			0
this causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert .			1
