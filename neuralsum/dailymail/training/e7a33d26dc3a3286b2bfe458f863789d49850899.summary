beaming broadly as a spiky haired @entity65 clown named @entity66 approached , @entity63 was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed the evening			0
the festival is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974			2
but while @entity63 and @entity1 appeared to be enjoy the show , the newest additions to @entity42 's royal family were nowhere to be seen			2

all smiles : @entity63 and princess @entity1 enjoy the antics of @entity65 clown @entity81 what a gentleman ! @entity84 plants a kiss on @entity1 's outstretched hand their absence did n't prevent @entity63 from enjoying himself , although the event did briefly take a sombre turn at the beginning of the night			1
part way through the opening ceremony , a minute 's silence was held in memory of stunt rider @entity95 , a.k.a @entity96 , 24 , who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on wednesday			0
despite his death , the show continued after the minute 's silence with elephants , acrobats and clowns all on the billing			0
royal approval : the clown , real name @entity110 , raised smiles all round round of applause : @entity63 , who was taking a night off from daddy duties , claps at the end of the performance welcome : new father @entity63 also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively looking good : despite having two tiny babies to care for , @entity63 looked surprisingly fresh royal wave : @entity63 waves to the @entity126 crowd from the comfort of the royal box tribute : ahead of the performance , there was a minute 's silence for a performer who died earlier this week the prince certainly appeared to enjoy rest of the show though , gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared and threw himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse			0
at the time @entity1 , who is patron of the @entity3 , was making her second visit to the @entity143 in a week , having already met clowns and elephant trainers on tuesday			1
during that visit , the 49 - year - old , who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000 , was seen patting one of the circus ' pachyderms , looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk			0
the royal , who also helps to oversee the @entity155 and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography , first attended the event when she was just nine			0
her father @entity160 was the brains behind the first festival , which now as then , specialises in traditional circus acts from clowns to acrobats			2
left at home : princess @entity74 chose to remain at the @entity167 along with the baby twins glamorous : the chic 36 - year - old was last seen on the 7th january when the babies were presented daredevil : a member of @entity174 group @entity173 performs in front of the royal box ouch ! an @entity178 elephant trained by @entity179 shows off his dexterity during the performance amazing : equilibrist acrobats from @entity184 's @entity183 show off their impressive skills @entity186 inspiring : an @entity178 elephant completes its turn as do @entity174 @entity189 and @entity190 magnificent : @entity174 equine troupe @entity192 wave a @entity42 national flag during the finale of their act			0
