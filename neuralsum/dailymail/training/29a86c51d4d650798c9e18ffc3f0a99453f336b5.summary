allegedly joined @entity20 terror group @entity19 and recruited members
told his colleague not to worry about suicide bombing as a sin
a *previous* version of this *article* stated *incorrectly* as fact rather than allegation that **mr** @entity11 was an @entity19 member and had joined a suicide bombing squad while in @entity20 . it also stated **mr** @entity11 was *suspected* of having threatened to behead @entity72 , when only @entity13 faced that accusation . a *caption* **wrongly** *identified* the man pictured as @entity7 . finally , a *conviction* for *knowingly* providing support for terrorism does not carry a mandatory life sentence , as we **wrongly** suggested .
