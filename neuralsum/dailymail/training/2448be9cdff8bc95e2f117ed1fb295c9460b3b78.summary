headteachers , social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £ 100 if a child regularly misses school , and their parents have not taken action or asked for help			0
if this is not paid , a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £ 2,500 , a three - month jail term or a community sentence			0
