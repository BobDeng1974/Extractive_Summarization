by @entity0 for a home which costs a shed - load , it wo n't give you much space			0
a humble brick and pebbledash garage measuring just 19ft by 10ft has gone on sale in a tiny village in rural @entity10 - for an eye - watering £ 38,500			1
the cost , more than for a one - bed flat 20 miles away , is thought to be one of the highest ever seen in the area			1
expensive parking spot : this garage in the @entity18 in north @entity10 costs £ 38,500 - more than a nearby flat @entity19 : the 19ft by 10ft garage has no water , no electricity , no heating and no windows - but a good location an estate agent said the simple structure in the picturesque @entity18 would be ideal for anglers , walkers and campers			1
its downsides include that it has no heating , carpets , electricity , running water or even windows			1
and it comes on a plot measuring 60ft by 30ft , which appears to be uncultivated hardstanding used for little more than parking a car			0
the description on the estate agent 's website adds : ' no mains services provided but we understand mains electricity is nearby			2
@entity51 water is positioned on a council byway			0
' yet the property in @entity54 , north @entity10 , is minutes away from spectacular views of the @entity56 and several popular fishing spots			0
how it measures up : the specifications of the garage compared to those of a flat 20 miles away in @entity62 rural : the garage is near the station for the small valley village of pont - y - pant ( pictured ) set in picturesque woodland , it is also close to a railway station and two miles from the small valley village of @entity71			1
at a push , the garage would even fit a small motor home			0
the prime outhouse costs more than an entire one - bedroom flat in the seaside town of @entity62 , just 20 miles away			2
there , buyers can get hold of a second - floor flat with central heating , electricity , running water and double - glazing for £ 37,500			1
listed last month at a similar price to several other flats nearby , it also has a separate kitchen , living room , bathroom , bedroom and even a mezzanine office			0
comparison : the recent listing for a one - bed flat for just £ 37,500 , £ 1,000 less than the garage 20 miles away peaceful : the garage is located in picturesque woodland and has just about enough space for a caravan secluded : the hut is off this country lane in the @entity56 , popular with ramblers and anglers but there is one major disadvantage - it has no off - street parking			1
average property prices in the @entity18 , meanwhile , are also low compared to the high price for a simple brick hut			1
at £ 118,602 , well below the @entity115 average , an ordinary terraced house in nearby @entity71 village is worth only around three times the cost of the shed			0
an average terraced house in @entity62 costs £ 108,000			2
estate agent @entity118 , who is selling the garage , said : ' the price might seem expensive but the @entity18 is a very popular fishing area			2
' we have had a lot of anglers showing interest in the garage for shelter and parking			0
