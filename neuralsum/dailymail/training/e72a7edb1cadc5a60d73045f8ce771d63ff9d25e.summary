there are more @entity3 children than @entity4 growing up in @entity5 , figures show			1
the latest statistics , extracted from the @entity7 , give an insight into the fast pace of demographic change across @entity11			1
they pinpoint several parts of the country where traditional religious beliefs are being eclipsed for the first time			2
the rest were of other faiths such as @entity26 or @entity27 , or none			0
a similar trend has emerged in the cities of @entity31 and @entity32 , the towns of @entity34 , in @entity35 , and @entity36 in @entity37 , as well as the @entity39 boroughs @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , where nearly two - thirds of children are @entity45			1
last night experts said more must be done to ensure that society does not become polarised along religious lines			1
professor @entity49 , of the @entity50 , which promotes community cohesion , said : ‘ what we are seeing are several trends running together			0
there is a long - term decline in support for the established religions , notably @entity59 ; continuing immigration from the @entity62 sub-continent ; and higher fertility among the @entity3 population , which has a considerably lower age profile			2
‘ there is also deepening segregation exacerbated by the loss of white population from cities and more intensive concentration of black and minority ethnic groups as a result of replacement			2
‘ this is the real problem , as residential segregation is generally compounded by school and social segregation			0
‘ nothing surprises me about the pace of demographic change			0
what does surprise me is that the government has no policy to combat segregation because it inevitably reduces understanding and tolerance on both sides of the divide			0
’ in @entity22 ’s second city of @entity5 , of 278,623 youngsters , 97,099 were registered as @entity3 compared with 93,828 as @entity4 ( stock image ) the figures show that @entity59 is still the dominant religion in every local authority area in @entity22 and @entity96 , even in the most culturally diverse towns and cities			1
of the 45.5million participants , 27.9million subscribed to @entity59 , compared with 1.8million @entity3 , the second largest grouping			1
however , among dependent children – defined as those aged up to 15 , or between 16 and 18 and in education and still living at home – the gap is narrower			2
of 12.1million youngsters , 6.1million were @entity4 and 1million were @entity3			1
and in some places , the balance has now tipped towards @entity45			0
in @entity31 , 52,135 children are @entity3 ( 45 per cent ) next to 47,144 @entity4 ; in @entity32 the figures are 22,693 and 18,190 respectively			1
the widest gap is in @entity42 where 62 per cent of children are @entity45 , outnumbering @entity4 by 34,597 to 8,995			1
@entity114 , president of the @entity115 , said : ‘ @entity11 ’s @entity3 make up just 5 per cent of the population but have a younger demographic profile than other faiths , as these figures show			1
it matters to us all that this next generation of young @entity11 @entity3 develops a clear and confident sense of their @entity11 identity alongside their @entity3 faith			2
it ’s important that schools teach all of our children the values of respect and tolerance			0
‘ @entity11 is doing better at this than many of our neighbours			0
a major new study this week showed that most people think the children of immigrants are integrating well			0
‘ this is one of the most tolerant countries in the world			0
it will continue to be so , provided we all understand how that depends on respect for the beliefs of others too			0
