she said the lady was not for turning on @entity2 - but @entity5 chancellor @entity4 has in fact made a sharp u-turn and now wants to stop @entity7 from leaving the eurozone at all costs			1
' for the @entity5 leader , it is essential to avoid the consequences of a @entity13 before national elections next year , ' said influential national news magazine @entity15 today			1
' @entity4 has already made up her mind			1
after long hesitation , she has sided with @entity19 president @entity18 and the @entity20			1
' sources close to the chancellery say mrs @entity4 fears a worse impact on the @entity5 economy if @entity2 is forced out than the fallout from the collapse of the @entity37 bank @entity36 in 2008			1
crunch talks : mrs @entity4 and @entity2 prime minister @entity39 in @entity40 last month , shortly before the @entity5 leader 's change of heart that implosion cost @entity44 five per cent of its gdp and hundreds of thousands of jobs			1
@entity15 added : ' until recently , @entity4 was prepared to drop the country if it failed to meet its commitments			1
' she now regards a @entity2 departure from the eurozone as entailing too many risks			1
' but the political costs are also too high for @entity4			2
' if @entity2 withdrew from the eurozone , her advisers fear that this could mean that it would eventually be necessary to create a common " debt union " to stabilise problem countries like @entity57 and @entity58			2
' it would be a paradoxical situation : @entity44 would take a hard - line approach with @entity2 , but might subsequently have to accept jointly issued euro bonds , which @entity5 voters widely oppose			1
' the @entity28 's controversial decision last thursday to purchase , if necessary , unlimited quantities of sovereign bonds from struggling eurozone member states has chilled the hearts of @entity5 voters - some 54 per cent of people oppose the move , according to a poll published today			2
mrs @entity4 , who has been widely criticised for wanting to lead @entity72 without a concrete plan to do so , is facing further criticism for her u-turn on @entity2			1
@entity77 risks : if @entity2 left from the eurozone , it might eventually be necessary to create a common ' debt union ' to stabilise problem countries like @entity57 and @entity58 the future 's orange : the chancellor looked worried at the first session of the budget 2013 debate in @entity40 @entity15 added ; ' so the chancellor has made up her mind , and will now continue to muddle along as usual			2
the problem will be put on ice for now , and re-addressed sometime after the 2013 @entity23 election - when the current rescue program has ended			0
' it 's clear , though , that it will probably take decades for cash - strapped @entity2 to modernize itself			2
the risks and possible side effects of @entity4 's approach are obvious			2
once @entity2 receives more money , the danger increases that the government in @entity7 will postpone its promised reforms			2
it would n't be the first time			0
' ' muddling along ' : mrs @entity4 , pictured shaking hands with her finance minister @entity105 , has been criticised for wanting to lead @entity72 without a concrete plan to do so the magazine went on : ' when @entity2 prime minister @entity39 visited @entity40 recently , he was left in the dark about the degree to which the @entity5 ' view has changed			1
instead , @entity4 announced internally that it was necessary to continue to exert maximum pressure on the prime minister so he would implement the required reforms			2
at the same time , she praised her counterpart from @entity7			0
' mrs @entity4 said that @entity39 is playing a ' historic role ' for his country , adding that she was very impressed with what he had to say			1
' we have to give him a chance , ' she said			0
' and @entity4 intends to see that he soon gets his opportunity			2
her plan calls for the troika 's report to present the situation in @entity2 as less disastrous than previously expected , as this is a necessary prerequisite for disbursement of the next tranche of aid			0
' she told her staff last week : ' we have to find a solution , ' mrs @entity4 is said to be optimistic that they will eventually go along with her approach			1
the @entity27 statutes may be strict , but the agreements with aid recipients - in this case @entity2 - nevertheless offer a great deal of leeway			0
@entity15 added : ' @entity4 , whose father was a pastor in communist @entity44 , has suddenly discovered a deep affection for the downtrodden people of @entity2			1
she compassionately expressed empathy for ' what many in @entity2 have to suffer ' , and said ' it does make one 's heart bleed			0
' we ca n't afford to cast @entity2 out : mrs @entity4 believes the cautious electorate will soon come around to her way of thinking this is code for her and her ministers being acutely aware that if @entity2 falls , @entity44 will have to pay - and the bill will come to almost exactly â‚¬ 62billion euros : the sum @entity2 owes the @entity160			1
new take : mrs @entity4 has now sided with @entity19 president @entity18 , pictured and the @entity20 of course , that would not be the end of the euro tragedy : to protect the remaining financially weak countries like @entity166 and @entity167 , along with @entity58 and @entity57 , hundreds of billions of euros would have to be mobilised			1
@entity15 went on to say that ' @entity4 is keeping her eye on the " big picture "			0
' the chancellor reportedly feels that the @entity171 can not afford to allow democracy to falter in a member state			0
she also points out that @entity2 is a @entity175 member and an important ally in the eastern @entity177 - a region that has enough flashpoints as it is			0
' her new , lenient approach has the advantage that it could allow her to reach the election next september without the turbulence of a @entity2 exit from the monetary union , ' said the magazine			0
' in return , she is prepared to play for high stakes			0
' she is putting off dealing with @entity2 until sometime in the future			0
' if she 's lucky , the @entity2 will have got back on their feet by then , and will need less money because the reforms pursued in their country will have finally proven effective			0
if she 's unlucky , @entity4 will be plugging holes by making new ones elsewhere - and it may all come to a head once the election is over			0
' another possibility is that the @entity2 economy performs so poorly that the money runs out before the rescue package expires			1
this would be the worst - case scenario for @entity4			0
nevertheless , she is consciously taking this risk			0
she sees it as manageable - unlike a @entity2 exit from the eurozone			0

mrs @entity4 is said to be concerned that the impact on the @entity5 economy if @entity2 leaves would be worse than it was after the 2008 crash

elections take place next year and mrs @entity4 is keen to avoid the consequences of a ' @entity13 '
