by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:59 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:54 est , 27 december 2013 a pet dog saved the life of his owner 's dying cat after he discovered the lost feline , which had a detached pelvis after being hit by a car , stuck in brambles			1
@entity12 and @entity13 thought their beloved cat @entity16 had wandered off when he had n’t been seen for more than 24 hours			1
but when their golden retriever , @entity19 , would n’t stop barking at a bramble bush in their back garden in @entity23 , they discovered the black - and white cat badly injured , curled up under the bush			1
@entity16 's pelvis had been separated from his spine and he had also suffered a broken leg realising their pet appeared to have been hit by a car , paramedic @entity12 and veterinary nurse @entity13 managed to free their pet with seceteurs before rushing him to vets for emergency surgery			1
vets agreed that if nine - year - old @entity19 had n’t gone hunting for the cat , @entity16 would almost certainly have died			1
@entity12 , 57 , said : ' @entity16 and @entity19 are the best of friends			1
we were starting to worry when we had n’t seen @entity16 for a day , but we were n’t too concerned			2
but @entity19 knew something was wrong			2
' we let @entity19 out into the garden and he ran to the bottom of the garden and was barking and barking at this bramble bush			2
he kept looking over at us and barking , but he would n’t leave the bush			0
vets said that if nine - year - old @entity19 hadn ¿ t gone hunting for the cat , @entity16 would almost certainly have died ' eventually we went over and that ’s when we found @entity16			1
it looked like he had been hit by a car , and had somehow dragged himself about 50 metres from the road back to our garden - even though we found out later that his pelvis had been completely detached from his spine			1
' @entity19 is an absolute hero			2
when we found @entity57 , he was down in the brambles , freezing cold and only minutes from death			0
' @entity19 would n’t leave his side			2
they really are the best of friends			0
@entity19 , wouldn ¿ t stop barking at a bramble bush , alerting his owners to @entity16 ' @entity16 will sleep with @entity19 in his basket			1
normally cats and dogs do n’t get on but these two will even rub noses			0
' @entity13 , 51 , adopted @entity16 after he was brought into the vet surgery she worked at - he had been discovered dumped in a wheely bin with plastic lodged in his throat			1
and as soon as he was taken back to the couple ’s home , he and @entity19 became firm friends			0
five - year - old @entity16 is believed to have been hit by a car			1
his pelvis had been separated from his spine and he had also suffered a broken leg			1
he had been missing for 24 hours when @entity19 found him cowering in the bush in the back garden of their home			2
within minutes of the discovery , @entity16 was under the knife at @entity88 ’s @entity87			0
the lucky feline is still suffering from significant nerve damage in his right leg but for now he is making a good recovery			0
@entity12 , 57 , said : ' i ’ve seen some bad things in my job but i do n’t think some humans could have endured that level of pain and injuries			0
' @entity19 was definitely the hero of the day			0
' @entity101 revealed that without @entity19 ’s heroics , @entity16 was unlikely to have pulled through			1
@entity103 said : ' we got an emergency call and within minutes of their discovery , @entity16 was here			0
' we had to give him hypothermic treatment as he was in shock			0
he then had orthopaedic surgery and stayed with us for a few days			0
' dogs quite often find other ill animals and alert someone to something abnormal			0
but it was still a good , heroic deed by @entity19			0

@entity12 and @entity13 thought their cat @entity16 had wandered off
@entity16 had actually been hit by a car and dragged himself to a bush
his pelvis had been separated from his spine and he had a broken leg
golden retriever discovered feline and barked until owners ' *investigated*
if @entity19 the dog had *n't* gone hunting for the cat , @entity16 would have died
