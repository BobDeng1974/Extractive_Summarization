by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity3 @entity2 chiefs are jubilant at the end of the group stage as to how well the tournament has gone , on and off the pitch			1
but despite the triumphant attitude of sports minister @entity11 and @entity12 , ceo of the organising committee , at the @entity10 briefing , there are serious concerns within the @entity18 at @entity20 ’s behind - schedule preparations for the @entity21			1
the fear is that rushing to complete a huge construction project — temporary and permanent — will lead to safety issues , with @entity3 ’s building and planning controls not nearly as rigorous as @entity27 ’s			1
a roaring success : @entity11 ( right ) celebrates alongside prince @entity29 as @entity31 scores for @entity3 against @entity32 ... but will the @entity33 be such a success ? volunteers are also seen as a big problem , with worries inside the @entity18 over ensuring that the 70,000 temporary workforce turn up every day			1
then there is the problem of traffic chaos in @entity20 that will be even worse when the obligatory @entity33 lanes are installed			1
@entity20 has coped with the traffic issue during the @entity2 by making every match day in the city a public holiday			1
but that can not be done for 16 successive days of @entity33 sport			1
the biggest panic is among international sport federations — many of whom are due to hold test events in @entity20 next year , with facilities nowhere near complete			1
a @entity21 spokesman said they are looking forward to giving a full update on progress to the @entity59 on their next visit at the end of september			1
and they have promised to give a million @entity63 the opportunity to learn a second language			0
this will include all those who apply to be volunteers , whether or not they are accepted			0
complaints : @entity70 was slammed for his co-commentary debut @entity70 has been given no opportunity by the @entity73 to remedy his nightmare , monotone debut as co-commentator in the @entity79 v @entity78 match in @entity80 , for which he was widely castigated and which saw the @entity73 swamped with 445 complaints			0
@entity70 , who is going home tomorrow , is a studio pundit for the @entity3 v @entity85 first - pick , last - 16 game , with @entity87 in the co-commentator role			2
the @entity73 would not commit to whether @entity70 would have remained as co-com if @entity79 had stayed in the tournament			0
the fall - out from the @entity93 biting incident is set to run for the rest of the summer			0
the @entity96 @entity95 are not likely to receive any reduction in the @entity93 sentence from the @entity10 appeals committee			0
but the next step will be to go to the @entity101 , who temporarily overturned @entity104 ’s lifetime ban from football for lack of evidence			0
after that , there is the @entity110 , who called @entity10 ’s banning of @entity63 midfielder @entity113 following a breach - of - contract row with @entity115 ‘ fundamentally unlawful			2
’ @entity117 ’s unilateral decision to spend £ 16million on his @entity10 history film @entity119 has not been reflected in box - office interest			2
it is understood only @entity122 and @entity123 have taken up @entity117 ’s vanity project , which @entity10 say will get another airing at the @entity127 film festival			2
@entity128 : @entity117 's film has not received universal popularity meanwhile , @entity10 somehow deny that @entity117 is purposely being kept away from appearing on the big screen during matches to avoid being booed			0
when asked why the cameras focused only on @entity136 chancellor @entity135 when she was sitting next to @entity117 during the @entity137 v @entity122 match , @entity10 secretary @entity133 replied : ‘ maybe the guy on the camera had a preference for @entity135			0
’ cruise control : @entity143 was on a boat around @entity145 as @entity79 lost to @entity146 @entity143 , the rent - a - quote former @entity147 cricketer , has laid into @entity150 over his woeful captaincy during @entity79 ’s defeat by @entity146 at @entity153			2
but it emerges that @entity155 pundit @entity143 was n’t at the game at any stage — and was instead on holiday on a boat around @entity145 for most of the match			1
it is also claimed that bon viveur @entity143 needed to set an alarm to wake him up to do his commentary stints at @entity164 during the first test against @entity146			0
sky claim @entity143 had not been partying too hard , is always highly professional and , if he had set an alarm , it would be to remind himself about his commentary slots .			0
