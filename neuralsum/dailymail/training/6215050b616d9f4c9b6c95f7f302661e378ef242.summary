by @entity1 reporter published : 07:10 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 08:49 est , 4 december 2012 a @entity3 wide student group plans to launch legal action claiming @entity5 has not done enough to protect the privacy of its hundreds of millions of members			1
privacy campaign group europe - v - facebook , which has been lobbying for better data protection by @entity5 for over a year , said it planned to take legal action in @entity11 , where @entity5 has its international headquarters			1
the move is one of a number of campaigns against the giants of the internet , which are under pressure from investors to generate more revenue from their huge user bases but which also face criticism for storing and sharing personal information			0
ceo @entity26 's firm is facing legal action in @entity11 over its privacy policies internet search engine @entity30 , for example , has been told by the @entity32 to make changes to its new privacy policy , which pools data collected on individual users across its services including @entity39 , gmail and social network @entity41 , and from which users can not opt out			1
@entity3 - v - facebook has won some concessions from @entity5 , notably pushing it to switch off its facial recognition feature in @entity3			1
but the group said on tuesday the changes did not go far enough and it was disappointed with the response of the @entity11 data protection commissioner , which had carried out an audit after the campaign group filed numerous complaints			1
' the @entity11 obviously have no great political interest in going up against these companies because they 're so dependent on the jobs they create , ' europe - v - facebook founder @entity55 told @entity61			1
@entity62 , @entity64 's deputy data protection commissioner , denied @entity5 's investment in @entity11 had influenced regulation of the company			1
' we have handled this in a highly professional and focused way and we have brought about huge changes in the way @entity5 handles personal data , ' he told @entity61			2
' we are committed to providing a service that enables millions of @entity3 citizens to connect and share with their friends here and around the world , ' @entity5			2
' the way @entity64 handles @entity3 personal data has been subject to thorough review by the @entity11 data protection commissioner over the past year			2
' the two detailed reports that the @entity51 has produced by the @entity51 demonstrate that @entity5 @entity64 complies with @entity3 data protection principles and @entity11 law			1
' nonetheless we have some vocal critics who will never be happy whatever we do and whatever the @entity51 concludes			0
' @entity55 , who has filed 22 complaints with the @entity11 regulator , said more than 40,000 @entity5 users who had requested a copy of the data @entity5 was holding on them had not received anything several months after making a request			1
the law student also questioned why @entity5 had only switched off facial recognition for users in the @entity32 , even though @entity11 is the headquarters for all of @entity5 's users outside the @entity98 and @entity99			1
the move is the latest in a series of concerns over @entity5 's privacy policies @entity5 is under pressure to reverse a trend of slowing revenue growth by selling more valuable advertising , which requires better profiling of its users			2
investors are losing patience with the social network , whose shares have dropped 40 percent in value since the company 's record - breaking $ 104 billion initial public offering in may			0
last month , @entity5 proposed to combine its user data with that of its recently acquired photo - sharing service @entity121 , loosen restrictions on emails between its members and share data with other businesses and affiliates that it owns			1
@entity64 also hosts the @entity3 headquarters of other high - tech firms including @entity130 and @entity30 thanks to generous tax breaks			0
@entity3 - v - facebook said it believed its @entity11 lawsuit had the potential to become a test case for data protection law and had a good chance of landing up in the @entity138			2
@entity55 said the case could cost the group around 100,000 euros ( $ 130,000 ) , which it hoped to raise via crowd - funding - money provided by a collection of individuals - on the @entity145			2
a @entity98 judge has given his preliminary approval to a second attempt by @entity5 to settle a class action lawsuit which charges the social networking company with violating privacy rights			2
@entity98 district judge @entity152 in @entity153 rejected a settlement in august over @entity5 's ' @entity156 ' advertising feature , questioning why it did not award money to @entity5 members for using their personal information			1
but in a ruling handed down monday , @entity152 said a revised settlement ' falls within the range of possible approval as fair , reasonable and adequate			0
' in a revised proposal , @entity5 and plaintiff lawyers said users now could claim a cash payment of up to $ 10 each to be paid from a $ 20 million total settlement fund			0
any money remaining would then go to charity			0
the company also said it would engineer a new tool to enable users to view content that might have been displayed in @entity156 and opt out if they desire , a court document said			0
if it receives final approval , the proposed settlement would resolve a 2011 lawsuit originally filed by five @entity181 members			0
the lawsuit alleged the @entity156 feature violated @entity153 law by publicizing users ' ' likes ' of certain advertisers without paying them or giving them a way to opt out			0
the case involved over 100 million potential class members			0
a spokesman for @entity5 said the company was ' pleased that the court has granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement			0
' lawyers for the plaintiffs were n't immediately available for comment monday evening .			0
