@entity1 wildlife expert @entity0 has warned humans need to help wildlife instead of ' chasing cures for cancer ' @entity1 wildlife expert @entity0 has warned humans need to stop prioritising themselves over the environment and help wildlife instead of ‘ chasing cures for cancer ’			1
the @entity12 co-host and outspoken naturalist also declared economic growth is a ‘ recipe for disaster ’ and blamed @entity15 for allowing humans to think that they can exploit the planet ’s resources			1
the 53 - year - old enjoyed a childhood that fuelled his love of nature from making camps in the woods to starting fires and catching grass snakes			1
however they are pleasures he said he rarely witnesses children enjoying these days and @entity32 said he fears it is because parents are afraid their offspring may get hurt			1
he declared ‘ risk aversion is killing childhood ’ and added children enjoying nature on their own are now ‘ extinct ’			1
it is not the first time that @entity32 has urged for the environment to be given greater priority			2
several years ago he warned the only way to protect the future of the planet is to curb population growth and suggested offering @entity49 tax breaks to encourage them to have smaller families			1
@entity32 made his latest wide - ranging and controversial comments in a joint interview with his @entity12 co-host @entity53 , 72 , for the @entity55 to mark the tenth birthday of the popular programme which returns to screens next week			1
asked what he thought the future holds for the environment , @entity0 said : ‘ we ’ve got to get to a state where we think about all life and not just human life			2
' @entity15 does n’t help : we ’re made in @entity67 ’s image so everything is there to be exploited by us			1
it does n’t help people ’s attitudes			2
we ’re developing technologies and skills , and our understanding of what we need to do to preserve species is increasing			2
‘ the reason why it ’s failing at the moment is that politicians – local , national , global – do n’t understand the need to look after our planet			2
@entity84 ( left ) , @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity86 ( right ) return to screens next week as @entity12 returns for its tenth birthday ‘ biological resources are worth trillions of dollars a year , when you think about the fish taken out of the sea , the forests cut down for wood , ‘ the oil pumped out of the ground			1
' so , at a certain point the ecologists will have an equal say to the economists			2
if there ’s one mantra that we need to break in the next ten years it ’s that economic growth is a good thing			1
it ’s a recipe for global disaster			1
’ warming to his theme , @entity32 criticised sir @entity116 ’s ' grotesquely misinformed '' project to put lemurs on a @entity119 island when they should be in @entity120 , but called on wealthy philanthropists to stop funding health charities and look to plough cash into environmental causes instead			2
he said : ‘ what we need in the next 10 years - as a stop - gap - is corporate funding and the benevolence of philanthropists			0
@entity12 is set to return to screens next week and @entity53 , 72 , ( above ) will appear as a special guest ' there are a lot of wealthy people in the @entity134 who , in the past , would give to things such as medicine and education , but because of the pressure on the environment they ’re now thinking of using their excess wealth to protect wildlife			1
' we need to stop chasing cures for cancer and things like that and start realising that the health of the planet goes beyond the health of human beings			0
' however , @entity153 , @entity154 ’s head of policy , said investment into research which could find life - saving cures and treatments for cancer remained vital			0
she said : ' more than 300,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in the @entity134 each year but thanks to research into life - saving treatments and cures , 50 per cent now survive for at least 10 years , compared to just a quarter in the 1970s			0
' but far too many still lose their lives prematurely to this devastating disease so it ’s vital that the public continue to support the charity ’s research which is entirely funded by their generosity			0
' mr @entity0 also criticised @entity173 boss sir @entity116 for his plans to create a colony of lemurs , disappearing from its native @entity178 habitat , on an undeveloped island he owns in the @entity119			0
he told the magazine : ' @entity116 has been putting lemurs on an island in the @entity119			0
i ’ve got nothing whatsoever against @entity116 , but that is grotesquely misinformed			0
' these are animals that should be on @entity120 ; they do n’t want to be in the @entity119			0
' @entity116 ’s money could be far better spent			0
we just need to tap into these people and say , " come on , you ’ve got the funds - if you want to make a difference you really can , so help us out			0
" ’ asked if there are species we should be especially concerned about , @entity0 replied : ‘ the children out in the woods , out in the fields , enjoying nature on their own – they ’re extinct			0
i walk my dogs twice a day when i ’m at home in the @entity205 ... when i was a kid there would be other kids out in the woods , making camps , starting fires , catching grass snakes – and they ’re not there any more			1
‘ risk aversion is killing childhood			1
i ca n’t tell you how many times i fell out of a tree when i was a kid			0
i once fell from 40ft onto a barbed - wire fence covered in brambles			0
i ’m still here to talk about it			0
i have a scar in my groin			0
i ’m not showing it ! ’ @entity32 made his latest wide - ranging and controversial comments in a joint interview with his @entity12 co-host @entity53 , 72 , for the @entity55 to mark the tenth birthday of the popular programme			1
