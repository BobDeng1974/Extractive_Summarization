by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 11 february 2013 @entity1 - the most romantic day of the year - falls on thursday and many will seize the opportunity to go down on one knee			1
but for one @entity7 woman romance is more than a day - it 's a year round job			2
jewellery designer and business owner @entity9 finds herself at the heart of hundreds of romantic and unusual proposals every year			1
loved up couples flock to her studios in @entity15 and @entity16 to share their love stories and get advice on how to create the engagement ring of their dreams			1
so @entity9 , 41 , who launched @entity22 13 years ago , seemed the perfect person to tell @entity24 about some of the unique proposals she has encountered over the years			1
each of the couples has visited her for an entirely bespoke ring that tells the story of their love ... underwater love : @entity33 proposed to @entity34 by writing a message on a sea bed in @entity37 @entity38 , 30 , proposed to @entity39 , 35 , on the bottom of the ocean			1
the couple , from @entity43 in @entity15 , are planning a beach wedding this year … @entity33 said : i planned to pop the question in @entity37 on our second joint holiday there			1
i 'd spent over a month on the island of @entity50 when i 'd been travelling a few years back			0
it is where i qualified for my open water and advanced diving licenses and i had become firm friends with one of the dive shop owners			0
when i returned to @entity50 with @entity34 i arranged for my friend to supply us with snorkel gear and a dive bag and i told him my plans			0
i booked a night 's stay on the tiny island of @entity65 about a mile off shore and the following morning i got up at sunrise and snuck off into the bay while @entity34 slept			0
in joke : @entity71 's ' wife me , @entity73 ' message referred to an episode of @entity76 the pair had enjoyed thumbs up : a snorkeling @entity34 signals her assent i collected a dive bag full of dead coral that had washed up at the foot of the beach and then swam out into the bay to write a message on the sea bed			1
i managed to get back to our villa just as @entity34 was waking up			0
ring to reflect the proposal : it 's shaped like a wave and the topaz gem is the colour of the sea i tempted @entity34 into the water by pretending to have seen a turtle			1
we swam into the bay and i kept making her swim further and further out			0
when she finally saw the message she did a double take and started laughing bubbles			2
she thought someone else had left the message			2
then she looked at me , looked back at the message , more bubbles and then nearly drowned as she forgot to breath ! we made it back to shore after a few happy tears on her part			1
the message itself is very silly			2
@entity34 's favourite tv show is @entity76 and during a @entity114 special , the wives talked about their proposals			2
@entity117 's wife said @entity117 had proposed via a text message and the narrator , @entity120 , screamed , ' what did it say , @entity122 ? '			1
it turned into one of @entity34 ’s favourite jokes for about the next six months , so i did n’t really have much choice but to write that as my proposal			0
our ring needed to be just as special as the proposal so @entity9 's team designed one around the themes of water and the ocean			1
the ring was designed to look like the crest of a wave and the central stone is blue topaz , to reflect the colour of the ocean			1
a perfect symbol of our future lives together			0
@entity145 , 45 , and @entity146 , 43 , both have a special place in their hearts for @entity149 - their 1967 @entity147			1
the couple , from northern @entity151 , tied the knot three months ago @entity145 said : it has always been the three of us and we 've had so many adventures together , travelling to car shows across @entity156 and even entering @entity149 into events			1
drive of their life : the @entity161 had to get engaged in the presence of their beloved @entity149 i proposed to @entity146 in march 2012 on a beautiful beach in a @entity151 village called @entity167			2
everything was perfect , the sun was shining and the breeze was warm			0
@entity149 was all spruced up for the event and i 'm even sure i could see him smiling for the photos			0
perfect fit : the ring was designed to look like a @entity176 headlight i wanted @entity146 to be involved in her engagement ring so , when she said yes , our creative side went into overdrive			1
we wanted a ring that had features of @entity149 so we trawled through photos and chose headlights as our inspiration			2
this model of @entity187 has a distinct , sloping headlight , so we took our photos and ideas to the designer and together created something stunning			1
look at the ring and you 'll see that the diamond represents a headlight and the setting is its holder			2
if you look closely you ’ll even see how the headlight slopes but the actual light inside is vertical			0
seeing our @entity176 inspired ring come to life was amazing and made our engagement even more special			1
we got married last october and @entity149 was , of course , a key part			0
he took @entity146 to the church and was even the inspiration behind our wedding cake design			2
my mum made @entity146 ’s dress and a friend embroidered @entity149 's registration number and sloping headlights on to her train			2
it was a day to remember			0
aviation loving @entity219 , 27 , took to the skies to propose to girlfriend @entity221 , 27			0
the couple , from @entity224 ’s @entity223 in @entity225 , are due to wed in april @entity219 said : when i decided to propose i knew i wanted an utterly unique location and a ring which would have real meaning and which could n’t be bought over the counter by anyone else			1
i wanted to propose in the sky but the first thing i needed to do was create a ring to match the occasion			2
i was brought up in aviation and flying is practically my life so i wanted to give @entity221 a ring that either looked like , or represented , an aircraft			0
on the wings of love : @entity219 took to the skies to propose to @entity221 in an @entity244 aircraft the largest aircraft i have ever flown is a @entity246 so i took this as my inspiration and asked the designer to use a propeller to inspire a twisted shape in the ring			1
the cone of the aircraft is where the diamond sits and three stones were added at either side to create a shading effect , something similar to the look you get when a propeller spins around			0
i chose the blue stones to match the colour of @entity221 ’s eyes			0
personal : the ring style was inspired by an airplane propeller and includes gems in the colour of @entity221 's eyes for the proposal itself i flew @entity221 in an @entity244 aircraft to @entity273 , the boundary point between @entity275 and @entity276 , which is where i popped the question			1
but i could n't get down on bended knees since i was flying ! @entity221 said ' yes ' and when we landed i presented her with the ring			0
we are getting married in two months and , with an aviation inspired ring firmly on @entity221 's finger , i know that flying will be in our lives forever			0
@entity286 proposed to his wife @entity287 , both 30 , with a ring inspired by their first holiday together			1
they have now been married for six months and live in @entity292 @entity145 says : @entity287 was learning to scuba dive when i met her			0
she convinced me to learn too and we fell in love in the water and have been diving buddies since			0
diving in : @entity145 and @entity287 share a love of the water sport @entity287 had dreamed of having an octopus ring for years , ever since seeing one at a diver ’s show			2
holiday memory : @entity287 's ring is made to look as though an octopus is clasping the diamond using an octopus as inspiration for our engagement ring seemed an obvious choice , especially since it reminded me of our first diving holiday together when the octopus we spotted under water took one look at us and immediately hid itself in a hole			1
our guide managed to tempt it out by using the metal strap on @entity287 ’s watch to catch the sun. it turns out octopus love anything sparkly so it seemed perfect that an octopus should hold the sparkling diamond in @entity287 ’s ring			0
i submitted sketches to @entity9 and the designer made exactly what i wanted			1
after having it commissioned i hid our engagement ring for a whole year and waited until we were on our cruise on the @entity335 , where i proposed at sunset on the captain 's deck			1
although we got engaged on dry land our diving buddies joined in to celebrate			0
find out more about @entity22 visit @entity343			0

@entity38 proposed to @entity39 by writing a message in coral on the bottom of the ocean in @entity37 while they were on holiday
they then had a bespoke engagement ring made to reflect the betrothal at sea
jewellery designer @entity9 has created numerous other rings to match some unusual proposals - including one made to look like an propeller for a man who took to the skies to pop the question and one *incorporating* a @entity147 design for a couple mad for their car
here , the four happy couples share their romantic stories
