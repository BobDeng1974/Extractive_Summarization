@entity1 officials treated @entity3 inspectors to a slap - up lunch today before taking them to the border with @entity6 to highlight their concerns about smuggling			1
@entity10 experts spent the first part of their fact - finding mission in the rock gathering information on border queues that have sparked a diplomatic row between @entity16 and @entity1			1
but they enjoyed @entity1 hospitality ahead of their afternoon the other side of the border in the town of @entity20			1
border queues have been causing diplomatic tensions as @entity6 citizens claim they are in retaliation for trying to build an artificial reef in disputed waters @entity1 foreign ministry officials took them to an upmarket restaurant called @entity30 overlooking the sea			1
they kicked off with an aperitif before tucking into plates of @entity35 salad , fried squid , a cold garlic - heavy tomato soup called @entity39 and tuna kebabs			0
the special menu included a lemon sorbet dessert			0
most of the party stuck to water although beer was provided			0
police guarded the entrance to the restaurant opposite the @entity49 as the group were escorted to a cordoned - off first - floor dining area			0
the inspectors , who are looking at border and customs controls , spent around an hour and a half at the ' working lunch ' before getting back to business on the ground			1
tensions over @entity6 have been rising since @entity1 's ruling @entity60 swept to power in elections nearly two years ago			1
they reached boiling point last month after @entity6 dumped 70 concrete blocks into the sea off the airport to stop @entity1 fishermen entering their waters			2
@entity1 reacted by increasing checks on cars with the claim they were targeting cigarette smugglers and money launderers - forcing people to wait up to seven hours to cross the border from @entity6			2
however @entity1 officials says they are necessary to stop smuggling and have nothing to do with disputes over @entity6 's sovereignty the @entity49 's chief minister @entity83 branded the @entity1 government ' neanderthal ' and accused it of acting like communist @entity86 after its foreign minister @entity87 threatened to charge motorists Â£ 43 a time to cross the border			1
the @entity10 agreed to send a fact - finding mission to the area after complaints from locals , @entity93 and the @entity6 government over the checks on traffic entering and leaving the @entity49			2
@entity1 has insisted its checks are vital to tackle the scourges of cigarette smuggling and money laundering			2
experts from areas including customs , justice and anti-fraud took part in today 's trip			0
a @entity10 spokesman said : ' the @entity10 will carry out an assessment on the basis of the information obtained during the visit and the information already provided			0
' based on this assessment , the @entity10 will decide if further action is necessary			0
' lunch was a working lunch and i do n't see where the inspectors had lunch as a big deal			1
it 's a long day and they had to have lunch			0
' they had coffee on the @entity6 side in the morning and from then on it was a question of timing			0
' @entity1 is a big country with more administrative layers than @entity6 so the @entity1 side of the visit required more time			2
