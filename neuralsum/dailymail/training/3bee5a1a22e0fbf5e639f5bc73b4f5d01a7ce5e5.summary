the author said she will use her position to be an ' advocate ' for public libraries and campaign against ' short - sighted ' closures ' i will do everything i can to ensure our library service is maintained or improved especially when you look at other countries like @entity88 which in 2012 initiated a programme to actually build 180 libraries and @entity91 are building libraries and we seem to be closing them and i just think its a very short - sighted move			0
