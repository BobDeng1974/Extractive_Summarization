passport chiefs are targeting 100 postcode areas for fraud investigations as they tackle the backlog which hit hundreds of thousands of families , it has been revealed			1
staff at the @entity7 have been ordered to give extra scrutiny to applications for travel documents for children from districts on the watchlist			1
the agency , which is part of the @entity16 , aims to focus its investigations on suspect areas as officials struggle to clear delays affecting more than 360,000 people , according to insiders			1
more than 40 of the postcodes are in @entity32 , and others are in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
many have high ethnic minority populations			1
other areas targeted include the historic market town of @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 in @entity47 – a garrison town with , a survey said , the country 's most desirable postcode areas – and @entity52 , @entity53			1
in may and june , thousands of families ’ holidays were ruined by mounting chaos at @entity58 passport offices			2
staff are so overwhelmed they are struggling to issue travel documents in time			2
there were reports of holidaymakers being advised to pay up to £ 55.50 to fast - track passports , guaranteeing they arrive on time			1
unions said the agency was in crisis because of job cuts and office closures			2
@entity72 mp @entity71 said it ' sounds like a deliberate postcode lottery ' caused by ' lazy thinking ' prime minister @entity76 was forced to intervene after it emerged that more than 360,000 applications had not been processed within the three - week time limit			1
the policy emerged in a document titled @entity82 that said officials handling applications for new passports from the 100 postcodes should complete ‘ additional checking ’			2
that could include contacting the countersignatory – the person who has agreed to confirm that the application for a child ’s passport is true and accurate			2
fraudulent applications can use the name of a dead person to conceal a traveller ’s real identity or rely on fake birth certificates or stolen forms			0
offenders wishing to conceal their identity include fugitives and terrorists			0
they may hope to illegally enter the @entity58 or avoid deportation , commit financial crimes or get involved in drug or people trafficking			1
@entity72 mp @entity71 , a former shadow home secretary , said : ‘ this sounds like a deliberate postcode lottery			0
it is lazy thinking to save money and save resources			0
doubtless there are an awful lot of non-fraudsters living in those areas whose service should not be altered by this policy			1
’ professor @entity122 , an expert in the use of postcodes to identify trends , said : ‘ this seems to me an example of a postcode lottery			0
targeting of this sort might make sense for avoiding the waste of government resources			0
but it is important that the service that citizens receive should n’t be adversely affected by where they live			1
’ @entity138 , the leader of the pcs union which represents @entity7 staff , said : ‘ rather than this sticking plaster approach of basing decisions on what is a potentially discriminatory postcode system , the @entity7 should agree to sit down with us to talk about the resources they need to provide a full and proper service now and for years to come			0
’ a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ @entity150 and detecting fraudulent applications protects the public and , in the case of child passports , safeguards children			0
‘ all applications are subject to a number of security checks			0
no one factor alone will determine the outcome of an individual application , a range of evidence is considered and taken into account			0
‘ all checks are carried out in accordance with @entity58 law			0
procedures have been subject to a full equality impact assessment prior to introduction but remain under review			0

the move is in a bid to clear delays affecting more than 360,000 people
more than 40 are in @entity32 - many have high ethnic minority population
other areas are @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38
critics say innocent people could face delays because of where they live
