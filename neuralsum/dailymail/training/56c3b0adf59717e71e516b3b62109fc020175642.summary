@entity0 just wo n’t be put down			1
having been out of the headlines for several days , he gave a toe - curling interview in which he said : ‘ i know the current captain would love to have me in the @entity5 team			1
’ to which @entity6 , the one - day skipper , swiftly responded : ‘ i ’m very happy with the squad of players i have			2
’ an ordinary man might have been crushed , but @entity0 seemed to take it as a challenge			2
so he promptly did something far more disturbing			0
he engaged the services of one @entity15 , who is apparently ‘ well regarded in the tattoo community ’ and was once dubbed ‘ @entity19 ’ by @entity18 magazine			2
@entity0 smashed 67 not out from just 42 balls during @entity22 ' victory over @entity23 @entity0 looks up to the sky after hitting a shot towards the boundary during @entity22 ' crushing win the @entity29 batsman ( right ) puts his arm around fellow @entity31 batsman @entity31 after the game and @entity15 , operating at a private clinic in @entity34 , drew a map of the world which started on @entity0 ’s chest and stretched around his ribs to his back			1
picked out in stars , like angry red weals , were the places in which he scored his hundreds for @entity5			1
now you may have your own views on tattooing			0
personally , i ’ve never understood the practice of allowing a chap who ca n’t draw to scrawl across your body in ink which can never be erased ; but each to his own			0
@entity0 walked along @entity55 on saturday morning before the game and gave the finger ( left ) the @entity29 batsman showed off his tattoo which displays where he scored all of his international centuries @entity0 points to the sky ( left ) and walks along @entity55 with his sunglasses and cap on yet @entity0 ’s case feels different			1
it is as if he is actively refusing to recognise reality			0
like one who listens only to the twittering sycophants who tell him he has been grievously wronged , that one day @entity72 cricket will come to its senses			0
so @entity0 , wilfully deluded , takes himself off to @entity15			2
he then ambles topless along @entity55 , gauchely posing for the passing snappers			0
as the visiting psychiatrist remarked of the great @entity81 : ‘ there ’s enough material there for an entire conference			0
’ @entity0 steps forward and smashes the ball for one of his 11 boundaries on saturday in @entity85 @entity0 ( right ) talks to fellow @entity87 batsman @entity86 during the victory on saturday @entity0 stands leaning on his bat during his innings of 67 not out from 42 balls on thursday the @entity29 captain ( centre ) walks across to the @entity23 players to shake hands after the match			1

@entity0 hit 67 not out from just 42 balls in @entity85 on saturday
*ex-england* batsman recently had a new tattoo showing all the places he scored a century for @entity5
@entity0 *believes* that @entity6 wants him in the @entity5 side
