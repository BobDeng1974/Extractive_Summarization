by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 5 july 2013 woken by an explosion that shook her home , @entity2 knew she was in a pickle the moment she saw the wreckage in her kitchen			1
the fridge door had been blown off and the shock wave had lifted the ceiling , cracked walls , sent shards of glass flying and blasted the casing off an extractor fan			1
fearing that perhaps a gas main had exploded , she called the fire brigade , who revealed that her flat had actually been blown up by ... rhubarb chutney			1
@entity21 : the force of the exploding rhubarb chutney jar was powerful enough to rip the door off @entity2 's fridge shaken : mrs @entity2 with her new fridge after a jar of chutney destroyed her previous one mrs @entity2 , 66 , had been given the home - made preserve by a neighbour and had left it in the fridge in an uncovered ceramic ramekin			1
after five days , the chutney , which was made without the chemical preservatives used in mass - produced varieties , began to ferment and give off methane – a gas that can be explosive when mixed with air			1
and so it proved for @entity41 , whose fridge had been shut for 12 hours , meaning there was nowhere for the gas to go until she heard a ‘ massive bang ’ while in bed at 7am			2
‘ it was a terrible shock , ’ the divorcee said			2
‘ my bed jolted and there was a tremendous noise			2
‘ i knew it was from my flat and approached the kitchen with trepidation			0
it was a total mess inside			0
wreckage : @entity2 was confronted with a scene of destruction after investigating a huge explosion in her kitchen early on tuesday morning ‘ i always keep the kitchen door shut but it had blown that open			1
the sides of the fridge had ballooned out and it was split at the back			2
‘ i was quite shaken up			0
i ’m just glad i was n’t in the kitchen at the time – it could ’ve killed me			0
‘ i did n’t know what had happened and was worried there might be more explosions , so i rang 999			0
’ in a pickle : @entity2 , 66 , pictured , woke to find her kitchen had been destroyed by an exploding jar of chutney baffled firemen were left scratching their heads after the explosion on tuesday , having failed to find any fault with the fridge , until someone asked mrs @entity2 what she had left in it – and the penny dropped			1
@entity83 , technical manager of the @entity85 retirement complex where mrs @entity2 lives , said : ‘ methane from the chutney was the only logical cause			1
' i spoke to the fire service and they agreed			0
it ’s a real one - off			0
' i ’ve never come across anything like this before			0
we ’ve asked around to see if anyone else may have been given some of this chutney – obviously it does n’t pay to have it knocking around too long			2
’ dr @entity100 , a @entity101 , said : ‘ methane and air are highly explosive , but normally you ’d have to have an electrical spark			0
perhaps the light in the fridge was faulty			2
it ’s a very rare occurrence			0
’ mrs @entity2 , of @entity109 , @entity110 , said : ‘ you would n’t think a little jar of rhubarb chutney could do such a thing			1
' i thought the pressure building up in the fridge would force the door open to let the gases out , but the fire brigade tell me that when gases build up in a fridge , it actually makes the door seal itself even tighter			1
’ mrs @entity2 , who will now have to redecorate , added : ‘ the chutney tasted absolutely delicious , by the way			1
’ fermentation : the explosion , which tore doors off their hinges , was caused by a build up of gasses in a jar of homemade rhubarb chutney which had been left in the fridge preparation time : ten minutes			1
