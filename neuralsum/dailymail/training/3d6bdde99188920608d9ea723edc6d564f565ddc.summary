a teen video blogger who has courted controversy by saying that domestic abuse is a sign of love has been told that her logic is ' flawed at so many levels			1
' @entity7 , 18 , appeared on dr @entity9 's show in response to a video she posted online last year			1
in the video , which has been viewed more than five million times , @entity7 told viewers not many boyfriends ' care enough ' to beat their girlfriends but those are ' willing ' to do so are ' amazing '			1
' [ @entity39 ] loves you because he 's risking for you to press charges on him , he is risking for you know , you calling the police			1
' he 's gon na do time or he 's gon na have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be			1
' he 's risking all of that for you			2
' during her appearance on the show , @entity7 told dr @entity9 she suffered a backlash after posting the video and that she is misunderstood			1
she mentioned she received messages of support and understanding as well and feels she is a role model for her 153,000 fans and followers			1
dr @entity9 questioned her belief that a boyfriend risking jail time over abuse charges was a positive			1
he said : ' your theory is that because they 're willing to put themselves at risk of going to jail , paying fines , whatever , that you must mean an awful lot to them , or they would n't put themselves in harm 's way for you and therefore , you must really be loved ? ' she replied : ' exactly			2
not anyone is just going to go to jail for you			0
' you know , they 're investing time and money , and it 's just a lot			2
so , like , he must really care			2
' i really do believe that			0
' the video was met with criticism online ( pictured ) and @entity7 told dr @entity9 that she felt misunderstood after he let @entity7 have her say and defend her reasoning , dr @entity9 told the teen : ' your logic is flawed at so many levels			1
' he continued : ' i am very concerned that the idiotic message that you 're putting out there could cause an innocent young girl to put herself in harm 's way following that logic and get herself hurt			1
' i think what you 're saying is irresponsible			0
i think it is ridiculous			0
somebody needs to tell you straight up what 's wrong with what you 're saying			2
' dr @entity9 is n't the only one who is critical of @entity7 's message			1
the ' @entity107 ' page was created on @entity108 for the purpose of exposing @entity7 and ' her awful posts and statuses '			1
following @entity7 's appearance on the show , the page creator wrote : ' not only is what she 's saying dangerous , but it 's completely disgusting that she thinks domestic violence is a joke and a way to get attention			1
' let 's stop her and the violence against young women all together			2
' another user wrote that @entity7 was more affected by appearing on the show than she let on : ' @entity7 honey without sounding rude you need to understand that someone hitting you does n't mean they love you			1
' your eyes showed u know this is wrong by the tears u were holding in			0
' i truly hope u see a different side now u have heard how wrong this is from millions of people			0
' the full transcript of the shocking video uploaded by @entity7 on her @entity108 page			1
okay you guys , i wanted to address something , mainly with you girls , about your boyfriend or the guy you 're talking to and i just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you 're with puts his hands on you like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does			2
that n * * * * * f * * * * * * loves you because he 's risking for you to press charges on him , he is risking for you know , you calling the police or you know , he - he 's gon na do time or he 's gon na have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be , he 's risking all of that for you			2
so that n * * * * * f * * * * * * loves you ! and you need to get on your f * * * * * * knees and just pray and hope that he does n't give you another black - eye or he does n't kill you			0
because honestly , like , a guy that 's willing to do that for a girl , it 's - i mean , it 's amazing , like , not many guys you have out there care enough for the girls to do that			1
but the guys that do that they 're the real like the real ass n * * * * * and you - you girls need to appreciate it			2
and you know the other day my boyfriend gave me a black - eye , it was my fault , like , he did n't mean - i mean he , he - he was going to hit me but like i moved , so he got my eye			0
' like , he hit me in my eye whatever , he gave me a black - eye			0
but i 'm wearing make - up right now so you ca n't tell but it 's on this eye			0
i was going to go out somewhere today so he took me to get my make - up done because he did n't want people seeing me with him , you know , because i had a black - eye , they were gon na be like ' what f * * * ' , you know			0
' or whatever , he just did n't like that or whatever			0
so i went to go get my makeup done but the fact that he put his hands on me means a lot to me because that shows me how he cares			0
' and as you asked like he hit me , like , after i realized how stupid i was , how i could have avoided everything , i got on my knees and i begged him like please ' do not leave me ' , like , i am so sorry for what i , you know , for what i did			0
' like , you gave me an order and i did n't follow it and now i know not to disrespect you , not to talk back , if he gives me an order to follow it and i know you b * * * * * s are gon na be like , well where 's your proof , well you know well my proof of like my black - eye , i took a picture of it , it 's on my @entity231 and my @entity231 is romina - kdashian so you can always follow me on there			0
