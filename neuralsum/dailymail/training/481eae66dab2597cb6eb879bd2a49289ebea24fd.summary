by @entity0 there have been plenty of songs written about spiders and their webs , and now scientists have found the creatures are musical in their own right			0
using lasers , researchers found spiders pluck their complex constructions like guitar strings to gather information about their surroundings			2
spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that when a thread is plucked , the sound created carries information about prey , mates , and even the structural integrity of a web			1
the silk ( pictured ) transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that , when plucked , its sound carries information about prey , mates , and even the structural integrity of a web spiders pluck the threads of their webs like a guitar string to glean information about their surroundings			1
@entity41 silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that , when plucked , the sound that is made carries information about prey , mates , and even the structural integrity of a web			1
spiders have poor eyesight so they rely on the vibration of the silk in their web for sensory information			0
they can glean information such as exactly what their next meal is and the quality of a prospective mate			0
they receive the information using organs on each of their legs called slit sensillae			0
spiders can ‘ tune ’ the silk by adjusting the tension and connections to build a better web			0
the discovery was made by researchers from the universities of @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 who fired bullets and lasers at spider silk to study how it vibrates			1
they found that spider silk can be tuned to a wide range of harmonics			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity91 , not only reveal more about spiders but could also inspire a wide range of new technologies , such as tiny light - weight sensors			1
‘ most spiders have poor eyesight and rely almost exclusively on the vibration of the silk in their web for sensory information , ’ said @entity96 of the @entity97 who led the research at @entity78			2
‘ the sound of silk can tell them what type of meal is entangled in their net and about the intentions and quality of a prospective mate			0
by plucking the silk like a guitar string and listening to the " echoes " the spider can also assess the condition of its web			1
’ this technique is used by the spider in its web by ‘ tuning ’ the silk - controlling and adjusting both the inherent properties of the silk and the tensions and interconnectivities of the silk threads that make up the web			2
to study the sonic properties of the spider ’s threads , the researchers used ultra-high - speed cameras to film the threads as they responded to the impact of bullets			2
lasers were used to make detailed measurements of even the smallest vibration			0
the discovery was made by researchers from the universities of @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 who fired bullets and lasers at spider silk to study how it vibrates			1
they found that spider silk can be tuned to a wide range of harmonics			1
images of silk during high - rate ballistic impact are pictured dr @entity155 of the @entity79 said : ‘ the fact that spiders can receive these nanometre vibrations with organs on each of their legs , called slit sensillae , really exemplifies the impact of our research about silk properties found in our study			2
’ professor @entity168 of the @entity97 at @entity78 added : ‘ these findings further demonstrate the outstanding properties of many spider silks that are able to combine exceptional toughness with the ability to transfer delicate information			2
‘ these are traits that would be very useful in light - weight engineering and might lead to novel , built - in “ intelligent ” sensors and actuators			1
’ dr @entity181 of the @entity182 explained that spider silks are well known for their impressive mechanical properties , but the vibrational properties have been relatively overlooked			0
‘ now we find that they are also an awesome communication tool			0
yet again spiders continue to impress us in more ways than we can imagine			0
’ dr @entity191 thinks that spiders may even set out to spin a web that ‘ sounds right ’ as its sonic properties are related to factors such as strength and flexibility .			0

study led by @entity78 found that spider silk transmits vibrations across a range of frequencies
when a silk thread is plucked like a guitar string , the sound it makes carries information about prey , mates and the structure of a web to a spider
*experts* fired bullets and lasers at webs to study their vibrations and found they can be tuned to a range of harmonics
the findings could inspire *invention* of tiny light - weight sensors
