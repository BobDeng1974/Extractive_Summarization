by @entity0 exposing newborn babies to germs could help prevent asthma as they grow up , research @entity2 findings bolster the theory that modern obsession with hygiene and cleanliness has driven a boom in allergies and health problems			1
according to the ' hygiene hypothesis ' , exposure to bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life			1
many scientists believe that modern society , with its mania for sanitation and easy access to antibiotics , makes children hypersensitive to harmless allergens			1
researchers believe that exposing children to germs as babies could help them avoid asthma in later life the latest work , published last night in the journal @entity36 , may lead to bacterial treatments in which germs are intentionally fed to infants			1
the scientists found that when newborn mice were exposed to allergens they were better able to ward off asthma			2
other studies have already shown that airway exposure to bacteria can be effective at controlling allergy - driven airway inflammation in adult mice , the scientists said			2
the team , led by dr @entity50 , from the @entity51 in @entity52 , wrote : ' our current study indicates that such treatments could be greatly optimised by targeting the narrow developmental window that exists following birth , or by targeting specific molecules			0
' a key future step will be to translate these findings to human infants			0
' more than five million people in the @entity63 are undergoing treatment for asthma , including 1.1 million children			1
around 1,250 @entity63 die from asthma every year and mortality rate is the third highest in @entity69 , behind only @entity70 and @entity71			1
the latest figures , released last week , show that the numbers have been steadily rising since 2009 when there were 1,140 deaths			0
asthma attacks are caused by an over-strong inflammatory immune response to allergy triggers such as house dust mites , pets or air pollutants			2
the study showed that newborn mice were vulnerable to inflammation in the lungs when exposed to allergens			0
but when their lungs were colonised by microbes , they developed immune cells that are anti-inflammatory and can suppress asthma			2
the regulatory t cells kept the immune system in check and suppressed the @entity96 mice in sterile conditions to prevent this colonisation rendered them sensitive to bugs and resulted in asthma as adults			1
interaction with a protein called @entity106 was vital to the development of these cells , the researchers found			0
when @entity106 was blocked , it had the same effect as keeping out the microbes - an exaggerated response to allergy triggers that persisted into adulthood			0
figures show that 1.1 million children in the @entity63 suffer from asthma ( picture posed by a model ) the scientists wrote : ' overall , the concept of early developmental windows of allergic lung disease based on microbial colonisation represents a change in mainstream pathophysiological paradigms and presents unique opportunities for future post-natal modification of disease risk			1
' evidence is growing to support the hygiene hypothesis			0
in 2011 , in a study of 1,400 children , researchers at @entity132 in the @entity133 found that babies who received antibiotics had a 70 per cent higher risk of suffering from asthma in childhood			1
the scientists thought the asthma risk may have been caused by the fact that the antibiotics have wiped out swathes of bacteria - good and bad - in the babies ' bodies			1
they suggested the drugs had deprived the young immune systems of a healthy benchmark of normality on which to base their development			0
in the years before antibiotics and scrupulous hygiene , our immune systems were used to bacteria and learnt to ignore this as non-hazardous			1
but in a overly sanitary environment , the immune system can over-react to minor provocations , such as harmlessly low levels of bacteria			1
@entity133 professor @entity166 , author of @entity167 , believes we should convince our bodies they are still in the natural state of our ancestors			0
professor @entity166 , of @entity172 , said : ' we have gone from lives immersed in nature to lives in which nature has disappeared			0
' but our bodies continue to expect to meet our old companions , the parasite species with which they tangled for generation upon generation			0
' the latest research comes after a major report last week concluded that @entity63 is failing to cope with the country 's asthma problem			2
up to 800 patients are dying needlessly from asthma every year because doctors are prescribing the wrong medication or failing to properly monitor them , according to the @entity190			2
the report found that prescription errors had occurred in half of deaths while many other patients had not been offered check - ups or key advice on how to manage the condition and avoid attacks .			0

experts believe that exposing children to bacteria could prime immune system
*over-exposure* to antibiotics and a ' mania for sanitation ' causes problems
@entity63 has the third highest death rate from asthma in @entity69 a year
