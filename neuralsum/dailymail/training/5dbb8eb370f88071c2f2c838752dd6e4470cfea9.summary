by @entity0 a musical therapist who works with terminally ill children and their families at @entity4 has begun creating musical memories using the heartbeats of dying patients			1
@entity8 records the thump of a patient 's heartbeat using an improvised stethoscope microphone , and then lays an instrumental version of their favorite song over the top			1
the result is a precious preservation of the patient 's humanity , says @entity8			1
he would record musical therapy sessions with patients to leave their family with a collection of memories and music , but when he began working in the intensive care units with dying patients , it became difficult to capture these moments			1
' some of these patients can not speak , whether it is due to their age ( infant ) , progression of illness , or intensive medical care ( intubation ) , ' writes @entity8 in a blog about his work			2
after seeing a story on the news of a woman 's response to hearing her deceased daughter 's heart beating inside a donor recipient 's chest , @entity8 realized he could capture a patient 's ' rhythmic essence ' and create music that is meaningful to the patient and their family			2
powerless : when @entity73 and @entity75 's son @entity74 passed away , they felt completely helpless never miss a beat : the @entity77 listen to the recording @entity8 made of their son 's heart marking the beat to his favorite song , @entity84 's @entity83 , every single day ' the heartbeat is the most basic , beautiful metronome			1
it is such a powerful , audible representation of life and of the human experience , ' says @entity8			0
when @entity73 and @entity91 's son @entity74 , 14 , lay dying , he felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness			0
' our son was dying in front of us , and it was very tough			0
so just to hear that music , it really , really got my spirits up and i needed that , ' says @entity91			0
a musical life : @entity8 ( left ) with saxophonist @entity103 of the @entity104 , @entity105 now , the @entity77 listen to the resulting song , @entity84 's @entity107 , underlaid with the steady beat of their son 's heart , every day			2
' to be able to have that , and carry it around on my phone			0
it 's his heartbeat , you know ? i can listen to his heartbeat whenever i choose to , ' says @entity91			0
over the last six months , @entity8 has made a dozen songs , music as diverse as @entity121 and @entity122 , for patients and families to help them cope			1
@entity8 says many have played the heartbeat songs at the patient 's funerals			2
' to let me know that it â€™s in some way helping with their ability to cope with the very early onset of grief is a very rewarding thing , ' he says .			0
