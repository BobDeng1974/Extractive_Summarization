all being well , @entity0 will return to the scene of his greatest playing triumph on thursday			1
this time , he is the manager			0
at @entity5 in 1990 , wearing the red and blue striped shirt of @entity4 , he scored the dramatic extra-time winner in the @entity7 semi-final against @entity9			1
credit to @entity0 because he intends to take the team against @entity12 provided the announcement confirming that he is the new palace manager is made today			1
that is certainly the intention			0
@entity0 is hoping to take charge of @entity4 for their @entity19 match against @entity12 @entity0 back in his playing days scored a memorable winner over @entity9 in the @entity7 back in 1990 @entity0 played more than 100 games for @entity4 during a four - year spell at the south @entity24 club @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 leave @entity28 's training ground after @entity0 returned to say goodbye @entity28 captain @entity29 arrives at training , while @entity31 ( right ) gives a thumbs up @entity0 made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991 , scoring eight goals			1
the highlight of his time at @entity37 , however , was the @entity7 run in the 1989 - 90 season			0
@entity0 was one of the ' @entity39 ' ( with @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 ) and scored the winner against @entity9 in that memorable 4 - 3 semi-final victory at @entity5 ( the other three also netted in that match )			1
the @entity4 pushed @entity46 all the way in the @entity49 final , drawing 3 - 3 in the first match , but lost 1 - 0 in the replay			1
@entity0 played every minute of both matches			1
it would be easy to swerve this one , to sit in the stand alongside co-chairman @entity56 and club ambassador @entity40			0
instead he intends to be there for the game , most likely in the dug - out for the first of 19 matches that will decide whether @entity4 stay in the @entity62			1
good on @entity0 for that			1
he takes over a team who need organisation , focus and discipline after @entity69 was sacked following the 3 - 1 defeat at home by @entity72 on @entity73			0
on tuesday , @entity69 gave his first interview since leaving @entity37 and he could n’t resist throwing a few grenades at @entity76			0
‘ i would have liked the chairman to tell me they had a chance of getting @entity0 and would i mind stepping down , ’ he told @entity77			2
‘ when i was clearing my desk , @entity81 said “ @entity84 , they ’ve got someone else ”			0
’ @entity0 will acquire a leader in the form of @entity88 , but the club captain will be away for a month at the @entity90 with @entity91 @entity92 was in charge on sunday as @entity4 drew 0 - 0 against @entity94 at @entity95 his assistant called that right			1
@entity0 was always @entity97 , the man @entity56 wanted when @entity99 walked away two days before the opening game of the season			1
at the time , the former @entity4 man was n’t ready			2
on this occasion he is and his brief , beyond survival , is to build a team who can compete in the top half of the @entity62			0
in an interview given by @entity76 last week , the ambitious @entity4 co-chairman admitted that he craved a run in one of the cup competitions			2
@entity4 will turn their attention to the @entity7 on sunday when they go to @entity116 in the third round , but the priority remains the @entity62			2
all was quiet at @entity4 's @entity120 training on tuesday , with no @entity0 announcement imminent the circumstances will be very different at @entity4 , where the stadium has changed little since @entity0 ( below ) left for @entity124 in november 1991			1
back then the team trained at the @entity126 in @entity127 , and they have conducted a tour of south @entity24 in the intervening years before ending up in @entity120			0
on tuesday @entity69 complained about the infrastructure at the club and claimed the training ground was not the right standard for a @entity62 team			0
it has been interpreted at @entity37 as a bit of bitching , particularly after he claimed he took over a club in chaos			0
last season @entity4 finished 11th , which @entity69 insists was ‘ lucky ’			2
in the dressing room , @entity0 will acquire a leader in the form of @entity88 , but the club captain will be away for a month at the @entity90 with @entity91			2
now @entity69 has departed , @entity0 ( left ) will take the reins at @entity37 - his old club @entity56 made a bold move by sacking @entity69 after four months , and has appointed @entity0 instead @entity0 will also have his work cut out rebuilding the shattered confidence of @entity4 ’s forward line after @entity69 ’s criticism of them in recent weeks			1
@entity151 has not recovered from his miss against @entity46 in november and @entity153 , the best finisher at the club , is in need of direction			0
there will be money to spend in the transfer window and the club have already spoken to @entity0 about potential targets			2
at @entity37 he will have a greater say in recruitment , a refreshing change from the limitations of working for @entity28 owner @entity167			2
by hiring @entity0 , @entity56 has overlooked his man ’s disappointing spell as manager of @entity124 in 2006			1
he could not halt the slide and they fell out of the @entity62 after winning only five games with him in charge			0
at @entity4 , he will need to win a few more than that			0
@entity69 gave his first interview since leaving @entity37 and could n’t resist throwing a few jibes at @entity76			0

@entity0 wants to lead @entity4 out against @entity12 on @entity19
@entity4 have agreed *£* *2million* *compensation* *package* with @entity28 for their manager @entity0
@entity4 are expected to confirm @entity0 's appointment in the coming days
*caretaker* manager @entity92 preparing the team for @entity12
