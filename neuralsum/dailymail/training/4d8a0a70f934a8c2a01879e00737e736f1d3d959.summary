by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 17:46 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 17:47 est , 15 october 2013 pressure to secure a better deal for pensioners facing crippling care home costs intensified yesterday			1
former minister @entity6 said a plan to offer loans to pay for care was not delivering ‘ the objective the government set out ’			1
mr @entity6 , chairman of the @entity13 health select committee , particularly questioned a proposal to limit loans to people with assets of less than £ 23,000			1
former minister @entity6 said a plan to offer loans to pay for care was not delivering ' the objective the government set out ' in july , the @entity20 promised that the loans scheme would prevent anyone from having to meet the cost of care while they were alive			1
in a second attack on the scheme yesterday , @entity25 suggested that pensioners taking up the loans could be forced to repay thousands of pounds if they inadvertently failed to disclose all their assets			1
he urged ministers to change a ‘ nasty ’ part of the new legislation that could penalise elderly people who make an honest mistake in applying for the loans from their council			2
‘ as the @entity40 is now drafted , if you make a mistake the local authority can pursue you for all the money and even sell your house if you make a mistake , ’ he said			2
‘ fraud should be pursued , but not an old lady who has just made a mistake			2
it is a very nasty clause			2
’ promise : care minister @entity49 and @entity50 headlines from yesterday , top , and 2012 , bottom lord @entity25 ’s attack came as @entity54 signalled a change of heart over plans to deny middle - class pensioners access to the deferred - payment scheme , under which government - backed loans would cover home help hire and care home fees , and would be repaid from the person ’s estate			1
lord @entity65 , a member of the independent @entity66 that drew up plans to cap care costs , said of the government : ‘ i think they ’ve been a bit sneaky			1
’ @entity25 has praised the @entity50 for its ‘ sustained and splendid ’ campaign against crippling care home costs that force people to sell their homes			0
the peer said the paper had made a real difference by bringing the scandal to the public ’s attention			0
on monday night , he exposed the government ’s plans to restrict access to a deferred - payment scheme to those with assets of less than around £ 23,000			1
during his speech in the @entity88 , he also mentioned his admiration for the @entity50 , which has long highlighted the effects of sky - high care fees			0
three years ago , we revealed at least 20,000 people a year have to sell up to pay their care costs , denying their children an inheritance			0
yesterday , he told the @entity50 : ‘ i praise the @entity50 for its campaign on people having to sell their houses to pay for care			0
‘ we owe the government ’s original proposals to impose a cap on care costs very much to the @entity50 ’s sustained and splendid campaign			1
i ’m sure the @entity50 will continue to campaign until the government changes its position			1
’ @entity25 , a former political editor of the economist and @entity111 policy adviser , was created a life peer in 1999			0
however , mr @entity114 ’s spokesman said : ‘ £ 23,000 is the starting point because that is the means - test threshold			0
for those who have assets that are separate from their home , what is the level above which they should make some contribution ? we are consulting on that			1
’ care minister @entity49 said : ‘ no decisions have been taken			1
we ’re listening carefully to all consultation responses and take seriously the concerns raised			0
’ however , he also suggested that anyone excluded had a ‘ vast amount of money in the bank ’			0
last night , @entity25 , the @entity111 peer and former member of the 1990s @entity135 on elderly care , welcomed the apparent shift by the government			2
he said : ‘ it would be good if they raised the threshold substantially , but it would be best if they dropped it all together			0
’ the charity @entity146 shared his concern about councils being given the power to sell an applicant ’s house if a mistake was made in declaring assets , saying that it could deter pensioners from applying			1
however , a @entity156 health spokesman said local authorities already had such powers but only used them as a last resort			0
@entity160 , a former @entity161 adviser on older people ’s care , said : ‘ people with £ 23,000 in the bank , that they have saved up all their lives , do not have “ significant means ”			0
everything in the @entity66 proposals is being watered down and i kind of wonder what these reforms are going to achieve			0
’ a @entity54 source said : ‘ the idea that anyone will have to sell their homes to pay for social care is simply scaremongering			0
‘ the government is spending £ 1billion a year in order to ensure people can keep their homes , deal with the crisis left by the @entity111 , and help provide dignity for all in old age			2
