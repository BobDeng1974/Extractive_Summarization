a @entity2 doctor 's plan to develop a formula for ' vacation breasts ' that sees cup size increase for a period of two to three weeks has been met with concern by a top @entity9 plastic surgeon			1
@entity12 - based specialist dr @entity11 's research into temporary breast enhancement is set to be developed into a treatment that could give women the ultimate beach body for a holiday			1
however , a @entity9 surgeon says there are risks associated with the treatment , including infection , severe bruising and even being left with breasts of totally different sizes for an unknown amount of time			1
for women who strive for the perfect bikini body , the new temporary boob - job might be welcomed dr @entity11 is developing a formula that could see women have a temporary breast enhancement dr @entity11 , who developed the 24 - hour @entity35 , is now working on a new project , aptly tagged ' vacation breasts ' which will extend the lifespan of a saline injection			1
but dr @entity42 , director of surgery of the @entity44 , with over 15 years experience in the field , is sceptical about the process			2
speaking exclusively to @entity47 , consultant plastic surgeon and @entity49 ( @entity49 ) member dr @entity42 said : ' i can see why this is being looked at , and sometimes temporary solutions kind of work			2
' but for me the main issue is the chance of getting infections and the chance of further complications			0
it is a ' quick fix ' for women to boost their cup size , but what are the risks involved with ' vacation breasts ' ? @entity9 - based surgeon dr @entity42 has warned their could be problems with such a procedure ' there is much more to consider than it just been a ' quick fix ' - if it 's not done right there is a chance you could puncture a lung			1
the ' vacation breasts ' procedure appears straightforward and safe by recent details published in the @entity2 media			0
however , as with any intrusive action on the human body there are risks to be wary of			0
these could be : ' if it sounds so simple as just putting a needle in and getting bigger breasts then you will get more and more people not only wanting it done and more and more people who want to do it - but it has to be done correctly			2
' the key thing for me is , what you rely on here is that the saline is absorbed , but one side could go quicker than the other			0
you could be left with one side a b cup and one side a d cup , and who knows how long for			0
' these are the risks that are taken as it is not a controlled process			0
' dr @entity11 's hopes are that women will take advantage of the treatment for holidays and special occasions , as well as give them a real feeling of what a potential ' under the knife ' operation will feel like day to day			1
but dr @entity42 believes rather than simply take on - board the short - term benefits and psychological advantages , it 's vital any potential customers are aware of the facts			0
' sometimes we do experiments similar ( on an artificial breast ) on the table in the lab , just to see what it would be like , ' added the 46 - year - old expert			0
the 2 - 3 week breast enhancement might give new confidence to women on the beach ( posed by model ) it is believed that a two - three week breast size increase could help a woman decide if she wanted to opt for a permanent cup enhancement ' we know of what the results could be , but i ca n't imagine people would know all the facts about the operation			1
' @entity2 - based dr @entity11 pioneered the @entity35 procedure where , after only between 15 and 20 minutes , women 's breasts are given a boost by a simple saline injection			1
the enhancement lasts for roughly 24 hours before the breasts return to their normal size			0
@entity157 have been unable to contact dr @entity11 for comments .			2
