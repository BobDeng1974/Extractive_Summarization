@entity4 's @entity12 , enjoying an extended loan spell at @entity11 , scored the vital 66th minute equaliser and would have earned a favourable progress report from @entity3			1
however , @entity9 's @entity15 and @entity7 's @entity16 were also on @entity3 's radar			1
brave : @entity4 sent @entity3 to watch @entity9 defender @entity15 ( centre ) wanted man : @entity15 ( right ) is also being tracked by @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 strong man : @entity7 's @entity16 ( left ) is also interesting @entity4 as they look for defenders @entity27 in hands : @entity16 reflects on a key moment in @entity7 's 3 - 1 @entity30 win over @entity9 @entity4 are among a growing list of clubs keen on @entity33 with @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 all considering whether to bid for him in the summer			1
the 20 - year - old has long been touted as a potential @entity38 international but niggling injuries coincided with a dip in form that was until this season where he has prospered again under @entity43			0
@entity16 , who has been watched by @entity44 , @entity7 and @entity45 as well , is also 20 and a strong defender but may lack the quality in possession that @entity33 can show and that @entity4 are looking for			1
@entity4 are continuing to look at other options for the summer with a left - back , second goalkeeper , winger and striker among their target positions as well as another midfielder			2
@entity57 striker @entity56 has again been watched by scouts in recent weeks but the @entity59 has struggled in front of goal this season			0
@entity64 keeping tabs on @entity65 @entity64 scouts were again present at @entity67 where the focus of attention has been on young midfielder @entity65			1
the combative 21 - year - old @entity70 international , who is signed to superagent @entity73 , was booked during the 1 - 0 win over @entity75 with another starlet @entity76 scoring the decisive goal			0
targeted : @entity67 's @entity65 ( second left ) has been scouted by @entity64 numerous times under watch : @entity67 defender @entity80 is being monitored by @entity64 's scouts however , @entity7 have also been monitoring @entity67 's left - sided defender @entity80			1
the 23 - year - old , who is very good on the ball and plays at left - back for @entity86 , was the subject of a failed bid by @entity89 in the last window			0
@entity7 will lose @entity91 , with @entity92 hoping to confirm his signature soon , while @entity94 and @entity95 are also expected to move on			2
@entity92 are also among clubs keen on 32 - year - old @entity95 who has an option to stay at @entity98			0
vietto interesting @entity99 @entity99 are the latest club to ask about @entity100			1
a number of @entity103 clubs have expressed an interest in the 20 - year - old striker from @entity106			2
@entity107 is looked after by @entity108 , the former representative of @entity109 , and has been likened to @entity110 and @entity111			0
in demand : @entity106 's young @entity114 striker @entity100 is wanted by @entity99 @entity99 are opening talks with @entity116 over a new contract but have big name options in mind should those talks stall while @entity121 is seen as one who could develop with his asking price around £ 8million			1
@entity21 and @entity4 have been credited with interest but @entity126 's @entity125 who coached @entity121 as a teenager is also keen			2
@entity128 edging nearer to @entity130 loan @entity38 international goalkeeper @entity128 will discuss a potential loan move to @entity132 later on monday			1
@entity133 are willing to allow the 20 - year - old to move with @entity135 now back fit again and @entity136 a capable deputy			0
@entity130 are looking to strengthen the core of their side and want @entity128 to challenge @entity140 for the no 1 jersey as they kick on for promotion with a takeover from @entity146 @entity145 pending			2
experience : @entity133 's @entity128 ( left ) is set to go out to @entity130 for a spell on loan fingertips : @entity128 fails to reach a @entity151 shot against @entity4 in one of his rare outings for @entity133 this season @entity128 wasan outstanding playing on loan for @entity155 against @entity132 in december when he kept a clean sheet in a 0 - 0 draw and manager @entity158 is hopeful he can persuade the 6ft 5ins keeper to make the move			1
@entity128 joined @entity133 in january last year for £ 4million from @entity162			2
he made his @entity38 debut aged just 19 , becoming the country ’s youngest - ever goalkeeper , in the friendly against @entity167 in august 2012 , having been taken to the @entity168 that summer by @entity169 as third - choice keeper			0
manager @entity171 gave @entity128 his @entity173 chance against @entity21 last month and he figured against @entity174 , @entity4 and @entity175 before @entity135 returned			2
@entity171 said : ' we are fortunate here at @entity133 that we have exceptionally talented keepers at varying stage of their career			0
i 'm very confident with @entity128 and i know he can perform at @entity173 level			0

on his way ? former @entity38 boss @entity192 wants @entity24 's @entity193 in @entity194 newcastle are in enough disarray without allowing strikers to go at this stage and departures are unlikely but that wo n't prevent the @entity194 making a lucrative offer for @entity193 , who at 32 will consider all options			1
the @entity24 striker could yet wait for the season 's end before departing , when he will have more offers from @entity38 also			1
at that stage @entity24 will also expect to lose @entity222 and @entity223 with @entity92 keen on the latter			0
@entity24 are looking at players to replace @entity223 though with 21 - year - old @entity114 @entity226 on their scouting list			0

the 22 - year - old was at @entity64 and @entity4 as a boy before signing for @entity240			2
however , he was unable to make the breakthrough there and took the chance to join @entity237 where he has caught the eye with some solid performances and 13 goals			0
