by @entity0 published : 00:30 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 03:08 est , 13 january 2014 a woman whose tenacity and sexually charged savvy famously helped win millions in damages for a chemical - leak plagued small town will now seek justice for the @entity8 whose tap water was poisoned thursday thanks to what appears to be a chemical company 's shoddy safety practices			1
@entity13 announced on her personal website friday that she and her team are headed to @entity16 , @entity17 to investigate the cause and possible implications of the 750,000 gallons of a coal processing chemical that spilled into the region 's water supply from a leaking tank at @entity24			1
' you have to find out what ’s going on , ' declared the gutsy blond who became a household name when @entity29 played her in a 2000 @entity31 film			0
famous name : @entity13 , who famously helped the illness - plagued town of @entity34 , @entity35 win some $ 300,000,000 after a chemical company poisoned their drinking water announced she 'll step in to lend her expertise 300,000 @entity8 ' fight for justice no ally : as 300,000 residents in and around @entity16 , @entity17 suffer without water safe to drink or even bath in , a banner name in safe water and environmental advocacy has joined their cause it 's an imperative that may not be easily met : as federal and state officials scramble to uncover who 's to blame for the disaster , a complex hierarchy of ownership of the plant in question starts at small town freedom itself and slithers upward to the likes of @entity61			1
thursday 's tragedy began with a smell : residents of @entity16 , @entity17 began to complain of a licorice - like aroma in the air , one that seemed most potent near the town 's water treatment plant			1
for an unknown period , a chemical called 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol used in the @entity17 's prevalent coal industry had been gushing into the @entity74 , a waterway from which @entity17 's largest water treatment plant sources its water			1
beware : more than 300,000 people have been told to indefinitely avoid drinking or even touching tap water following thursday 's chemical spill in @entity16 , @entity17 amazing life : @entity13 ( right ) became a household name after @entity29 ( left ) portrayed her in 2000 's @entity13 , for which the @entity29 won a best actress @entity86			1
after @entity88 's $ 300,000,000 victory against the chemical company responsible for sickening countless residents of @entity34 , @entity91 , she has continued her fight by helping other communities panicked officials warned residents in nine counties to immediately and indefinitely stop using their tap water and to not even touch it			1
as @entity99 swarmed stores to purchase bottled water they had no clue when they might get their water back because officials -- some seemingly clueless and others unwilling to say what they may or may not know about the leak -- remained mum on a cleanup time - frame			1
the unanswered questions greatly outweighed the answers			0
' i ca n't tell you that the water is unsafe , but i also ca n't tell you that the water is safe , ' was @entity117 president @entity116 beguiling answer to reporters eager to know the dangers of the spill at a friday press conference			2
torn community : @entity124 of @entity125 , @entity17 talks about how the ban on using tap water for drinking and washing has detrimentally effected her and her family sunday			1
the coal miner widow made clear that she did not blame the coal or chemical industries for the spill necessary for life : @entity124 of @entity125 has to cover her faucets in bags as a reminder that she can not use the tap water in her home because of thursday 's spill it left people , especially those unable to leave the affected area -- the poor , the disabled , the elderly -- terrified			1
it 's just that sort of scenario that catches the attentions of the famed environmental crusader and her investigative team			0
' when things like this happen , we respond accordingly , ' @entity13 told the @entity156			2
' people have contacted us who are concerned , and it ’s certainly a scenario that concerns us			0
i mean , there are 300,000 people without water right now			2
' ' the emergency now is getting the back - up plan and getting water to these people and businesses			2
' then , we can look at damages			0
we do n’t know any of the answer to this right now			0
i mean , what did n’t we learn from the @entity175 spill or the @entity177 spill			0
what have we not learned ? ' we have to start looking at the question of , " are we forcing an issue where speed , greed and money are more important than safety ? " ' after fixing the immediate problem of finding drinking water , @entity13 said it must be determine what lasting affects @entity17 's leak will have on its children , ecosystem and wildlife			1
it 's the same process she took beginning in 1993 when she began her quest in @entity34 , @entity35 where @entity195 helped sicken an entire town following a serious and subsequently concealed release of dangerous @entity198 into the town well water			2
the detrimental health effects of chromium 6 are well studied , however the compound the poured into the @entity17 river last week is not nearly as well understood , especially at the extreme levels released during the leak			2
@entity207 need : employees of the @entity209 help local residents to obtain water as officials remained mum as to win the tap water would become safe again workers at @entity24 continued through the night to empty storage tanks of chemicals into tanker trucks at it 's plant in @entity16 , @entity17 on sunday , days after it dumped 7,500 gallons of a toxic chemical into the river where 300,000 residents in the area get their water at least it 's not lethal : while considered ' not lethal ' 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol is harmful if swallowed and can cause nausea , irritation , and headaches poison control experts wo n't categorize 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol as lethal but will only refer to the chemical as ' harmful if swallowed			1
' the substance is considered dangerous to touch , hence the warnings not to bathe in city water			2
the chemical may also be harmful when airborne , but quickly dissipates in air , where it produces a licorice smell			0
it will take days for the substance in the water to break down and far longer for it to break down in the soil surrounding the river			0
the chemical 's concentration in the local water supply was lower friday , but not to the point officials felt safe allowing people to drink the water again - and @entity16 's mayor did n't mince words in voicing his displeasure			1
' it 's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine , ' he told @entity261			0
' it 's a prison from which we would like to be released			0
' the ban has forced schools , offices , restaurants , hotels and other businesses to shutter , but hospitals have remained busy			0
once the residents of @entity17 are safe again , @entity13 -- who helped the residents of @entity34 win a reported $ 333,000,000 settlement against @entity195 in @entity35 -- says the next step in @entity17 is obvious			1
' when that is all resolved , it ’s safe to say law firms are going to come in and look at everything			0
i saw today that six lawsuits already have been filed			0
we knew that was going to happen , of course			0

@entity13 gained *notoriety* when she helped win a $ 333 million settlement for a town plagued by a chemical company 's shoddy safety practices and coverups
some 300,000 residents in and around @entity17 saw their drinking water poisoned thursday after a *ruptured* pipe at @entity24
@entity296 president @entity295 appeared before cameras on friday evening to *apologize* but failed to *convince* as he sipped bottled water

as much as 7,500 gallons of the toxic chemical 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol spilled into the @entity74 , near the state 's largest water treatment intake
