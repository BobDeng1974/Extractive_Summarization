by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 05:44 est , 11 october 2013 the @entity2 's major network operators have been forced to deny claims the rollout of @entity5 has had a negative affect on older , 3g services after a string of customer complaints			1
yet a @entity10 investigation has revealed internet services and calls in certain parts of the country have dropped since @entity5 became more widely available			1
it 's been a year since @entity16 launched its 4g network in the @entity2 , and just over a month since @entity18 and @entity19 began rolling out their respective services			2
customers have taken to @entity22 to complain that the @entity5 switch - on has made older services , including @entity26 internet , calls and texts slower and less reliable , yet mobile operators deny this			1
a @entity10 investigation has revealed internet services in some areas of the country have dropped since the rollout of @entity5			1
it 's been a year since @entity16 launched its 4g network in the @entity2 , and just over a month since @entity18 and @entity19 began rolling out their respective services			2
a watchdog investigation was launched in september after a stream of complaints criticised @entity16 's @entity5 service			1
they ranged from complaints about internet speeds to a rise in call failures and overall poor service			1
it discovered that at times operators may suggest to customers that when they 're having trouble with their 4g service , they should switch down to @entity26 temporarily			1
however , this may put the 3g network under too much strain and affect the performance of this slower speed , as well			0
@entity16 apologised to customers if they had suffered poor service but denied there was was an overreaching problem : ' it is entirely correct that when a 4g user makes a @entity62 call the call is currently passed through the 3g network - most importantly , there is no negative experience for customers caused by this			1
' one @entity19 customer explained to @entity10 how he streams videos on the train on his way home from work in @entity75			0
he used to be able to stream a football tv show on his @entity77 on his homebound journey but now the signal drops ' regularly ' and it has become ' impossible to watch			0
' ' if i try to stream a video , or open sites with pictures on , the internet grinds to a halt			0
' i never used to have any problems and i have n't changed my route home , or my phone - it 's frustratingly poor , ' he said			2
' i 'm sure it has something to do with 4g launching in @entity75			0
it 's too much of a coincidence not to be and other people i know have complained about similar problems			0
' @entity99 on @entity22 added he has noticed a difference since the @entity5 switch - on : ' on @entity26 , sometimes @entity22 , @entity101 and internet is slower than usual			1
' although adds that this may be due to his handset			0
while @entity107 tweeted hers has been more ' rubbish than usual			0
' when asked for comment , @entity18 denied its network had been affected and told @entity10 : ' we ’ve checked with our technical teams and there have been no unusual activity on our 3g network			2
customers have taken to @entity22 to complain the @entity5 switch - on has made older services , including 3g internet , calls and texts slower and less reliable , yet mobile operators including @entity19 and @entity18 deny this			1
@entity19 's ceo @entity124 believes @entity5 investment will boost 2g and @entity26 services ' our 4g service works on a different part of the airwaves than our 3g and 2g services , so there is no knock on effect for our existing customers			1
' we are currently upgrading sites across the country every day to install @entity5 and to improve existing @entity139 coverage			2
' if readers are complaining about an issue in a specific area , can you please ask them the postcode of the area in which they experienced it and we can investigate			0
' an @entity19 spokesman similarly added : ' we ’ve spent a number of months getting ready for @entity5 and carried out rigorous testing to ensure our 3g service is n’t impacted by @entity5			2
' this will continue as we roll out @entity5 , improving our depth of coverage and focus on delivering a great network experience for all our customers			1
' wireless coverage mapping experts @entity156 let users compare the signal strength and coverage of different networks across the @entity2			0
it produces reports that compare the internet speeds , reliability of calls and texts of various providers			1
in @entity173 , used as an example , the top four providers in july 2013 , in terms of internet speeds , were @entity16 , with a score of 109 , three with a score of 80 , @entity19 with 70 and @entity18 on 54 ( see chart above			1
) call reliability in the same month showed @entity18 had the most call failures ( 3.4 per cent ) , three was in second at 1.9 per cent , @entity16 suffered 1.5 per cent call dropouts and @entity19 was on 1.2 per cent			0
when this is compared to the same report compiled this month ( see chart above ) - after @entity18 and @entity19 have begun rolling out @entity5 across the country in addition to the @entity16 service - every single operator dropped internet speed points			1
the drops were marginal but @entity16 scored 106 , down three points , @entity178 was on 78.9 , @entity19 dropped 0.2 points to 69.8 and @entity18 lost almost ten points to 44.9			0
there was also a rise in the number of call failures across three of the four networks			0
@entity18 dropped calls 3.8 per cent of the time , three was second again at 2.8 per cent			2
@entity16 had 1.6 per cent call failures , while @entity19 stayed the same			0
although it is unclear what the causes for these drops were - and the drops are specific to the @entity173 region meaning it might not be the case nationwide - the figures do indicate services have been adversely affected in recent months			1
figures in @entity214 and @entity215 , @entity75 and @entity216 showed a similar decline in certain services			2
in response to a tweet by @entity222 asking whether anyone had experienced problems , @entity219 admitted : ' @entity26 has definitely got noticeably slower on @entity19 since 4g launch , ' and @entity227 the @entity226 added : ' i wo n't be signing up to @entity5 until they can demonstrate its reliable			1
@entity26 is most certainly not at the moment ! ' a watchdog report was launched recently after a stream of complaints criticised @entity16 's @entity5 service			1
they ranged from complaints about internet speeds to a rise in call failures and overall poor service @entity19 's ceo @entity124 tweeted : ' on average 3g speeds are higher - dual band devices and @entity242 +			1
offset in part by growth in traffic - new spectrum helps this			0
' the investment in @entity5 will improve the @entity249 and @entity26 experience as well			1
' commenting on the news , @entity250 , mobiles expert at @entity251 told @entity10 : ' the rumour - mill may well prove to have legs but , for now at least , it 's too early to tell if the launch of @entity5 is impacting 3g speeds			1
' @entity259 is busily collecting 3g speeds data and , once @entity178 has launched its 4g service too at the end of this year , we may see more than just anecdotal evidence that this is happening			2
' there have been some concerns that @entity16 and @entity267 customers would suffer as the spectrum they used for @entity26 was squeezed by @entity16 launching @entity5 last october , but again there is no evidence for this yet			1
' @entity16 , and other experts are also quick to point out that the @entity5 and 3g spectrums run on different frequencies , so it 's unlikely one would directly affect the other			2
@entity22 user @entity277 said : in the @entity2 , at the moment , @entity5 is on a different frequency from @entity26			1
variations will be down to the telco , not the band			0
' @entity16 and @entity178 are yet to respond to a request for comment			0
@entity16 , which was formed from the merger of @entity267 and @entity16 , was the first company to offer a 4g network in the @entity2			0
@entity16 held the monopoly on the network because regulator @entity259 gave it permission to use existing spectrum ( @entity292 ) that it already owned			0
@entity259 then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from @entity297 to @entity298			0
@entity19 purchased @entity300 lots and @entity18 won both @entity300 and @entity298 lots			0
for the typical user , download speeds of initial 4g networks should be at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3g networks			0
in july , @entity16 announced it was doubling its 4g speeds for people in @entity310 , @entity173 , @entity216 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity214 , @entity314 , @entity75 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317			0
the speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4g speeds and 10 times as fast as @entity26			2
@entity322 has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new 4g service by announcing it will offer the super high - speed internet at no extra cost			2
the firm ’s 1.5million customers will get @entity5 at the same price they pay for the current @entity26 , with packages of calls , texts and unlimited internet from £ 15 a month			1
the @entity178 deal will start in mid december , cashing in on @entity336 handset sales .			0

customers claim @entity26 internet speeds have dropped since @entity5 was enabled
others comment calls drop more frequently and texts are n't delivered
operators deny that @entity26 services are being affected by the roll - out
yet figures *confirm* a drop in service - although the cause is *unknown*
