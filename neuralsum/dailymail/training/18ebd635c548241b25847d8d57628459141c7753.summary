in the meantime , the barrister said , a man the prosecution claim was @entity5 got into the block by buzzing an intercom of another flat and saying ' police '			1
@entity5 then pretended to be a cleaner using a vacuum cleaner , in what was a planned attack by someone ' forensically aware ' , mr @entity32 said			1
' @entity7 then heard a knock on the door of her flat			2
' she opened the door which was then pushed violently from outside and she was either pushed or punched to the floor , ' mr @entity32 said			0

' mr @entity32 told the jury : ' he had a motive for doing so and who else would have the motive for carrying out the attack in this particular way , targeting the unborn child ? ' mr @entity32 told the court that @entity5 previously owned the flat and had sold it to @entity104			1
