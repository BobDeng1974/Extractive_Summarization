@entity0 last night urged @entity1 to bring forward plans for a referendum on @entity5 ’s membership of the @entity6			1
the @entity8 mayor , one of the leading contenders to succeed the pm as @entity12 leader , said that a speedy decision would be positive for @entity5 and @entity14			1
speaking on a tour of the @entity16 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ let ’s get it done			1
’ the prime minister has announced plans to give voters their first say on @entity5 ’s place in @entity14 since 1975 if the @entity12 remain in power			1
the commitment has become a key election battleground , since @entity33 has set its face against a referendum			2
@entity36 has dismissed the idea that it has secretly been planning to bring the vote forward to next year if mr @entity1 remains in office			1
however , during a @entity42 finance ministers summit in @entity43 , chancellor @entity40 hinted that the date might be brought forward			0
he said the prime minister would be ‘ delighted ’ if he could complete renegotiation of the @entity5 ’s @entity6 membership earlier			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i very much welcome the idea of bringing forward the renegotiation and the referendum			1
‘ let ’s get it done			0
we should stress that this is something that can be very positive , not just for @entity5 but for the whole of @entity14 and indeed for investors in @entity14 because a reformed @entity14 will deliver growth and prosperity			1
get it done , get the change , get it done , put it to the people			0
’ @entity1 warned business leaders yesterday that his planned @entity6 referendum was required otherwise the @entity5 would ' drift towards the exit ' and the poll would be based on his renegotiation of the agreement mr @entity1 yesterday warned that public scepticism about the @entity6 meant that @entity5 would ‘ drift towards the exit of the @entity6 ’ unless a referendum was held			1
addressing the annual conference of the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) in @entity8 , the prime minister insisted that firms were backing his plan to hold a referendum after renegotiating the terms of @entity5 ’s membership			1
‘ they are saying it is quite right to have a strategy that gives @entity5 the best chance of staying in a reformed @entity6 that works in our interest and that is what my approach is , ’ he said			2
‘ let ’s get stuck in there , let ’s hold a negotiation , let ’s deal with those things that are holding @entity5 back , and then let ’s have this put to the @entity5 public in an in / out referendum			2
’ a @entity36 source said : ‘ we have always said we want a referendum by the end of 2017 , and there is no secret plan to hold it next year			2
but both the prime minister and the chancellor have said if they can do it sooner , that would be great			0
we want to get reform agreed , and there are serious negotiations and discussions to be had			0
there are 28 countries in the @entity6 and we are not going to pretend that can happen overnight			0
’ however shadow chancellor @entity118 said @entity33 would never ‘ flirt with exit ’			0
he said reform of the @entity6 was needed , but claimed a referendum would be ‘ hugely destabilising to @entity5 business			0
’ he added : ‘ i fear that @entity5 walking out of the @entity6 is the biggest risk to our economy in the next decade			0
