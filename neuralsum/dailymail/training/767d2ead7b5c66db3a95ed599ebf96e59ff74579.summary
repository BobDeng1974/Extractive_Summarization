a study has found that some of us take pleasure in other people 's misfortune because it is a natural human response to envy			1
by monitoring people 's cheek muscles , scientists at @entity13 's @entity12 found that people tend to smile more when someone they envy encounters difficulties - an emotion known as ' @entity19 '			1
pleasure or pity : we 'd be more likely to take pleasure in someone falling off their bike if we knew they were successful and we envied them delight at others ' misfortune : scientists monitored participants cheek muscles to see if they smiled at certain scenarios the study was inspired by intense sports rivalries , with researchers wanting to find out more about why we revel so much in the failures of our rival teams			1
@entity39 , co-author of the study , said : ' jealousy and envy are highly correlated			1
when we ask people on surveys who is envied in @entity49 society , they report the same groups : objects of jealousy			2
' this is all very much based on stereotypes			2
and so , in this study , we sought to better understand who is among these envied groups and whether that envy and jealousy elicits a harmful response			1
' participants were shown photographs of individuals associated with different stereotypes : the elderly ( pity ) , students or @entity49 ( pride ) , drug addicts ( disgust ) and rich professionals ( envy )			2
these images were then paired with everyday events such as : ' won five dollars ' ( positive ) or ' got soaked by a taxi ' ( negative ) or ' went to the bathroom ' ( neutral )			2
participants were asked how this would make them feel , and their facial movements were recorded			2
ms @entity77 said : ' because people do n't like to report envy of @entity19 , this was the best method for gathering such responses			1
envy : the study found that people took pleasure when they were shown pictures of a rich business enduring difficult times ' and , in this experiment , we were able to viscerally capture malicious glee			1
' we found that people did smile more in response to negative than positive events , but only for groups they envied			2
' a second experiment , monitored the brain to see if participants were willing to harm certain groups and shown the same photographs			0
participants tended to feel most positive when bad things happened to the rich professional			0
a follow up test to see if they would be willing to inflict harm on another person found that people were willing to hurt an ' envy target '			0
finally , researchers used various scenarios regarding an investment banker as an example , to gain a response			0
the researchers threw information that betrayed steroetypes at participants			0
for example , in one article , the banker was himself , employed and status quo			0
in another , he was advising clients pro-bono ( eliciting pride )			0
in the next , he was using his work bonuses to buy drugs ( disgust ) and , finally , he was unemployed but still dressing to go to work ( pity )			0
again , the findings matched earlier experiments â€“ participants rated the articles associated with disgust and envy with less warmth than the pride or pity scenarios			0
ms @entity77 said : ' this experiment shows that the dimensions predicting envy are high status and competition , and , when you move those around , the envy goes away			0
' this is consistent with the story about who gets envied and why			0
a lot of it is tied into money because that 's an easy thing to look at			0
' rivalry : the study examined how fans of @entity156 ( pictured ) and @entity157 felt about the successes and misfortunes of their rival teams the researchers then applied their experiment to sports rivalry , taken fans from @entity156 and @entity157 and showing them a game between the two			1
naturally , fans took most pleasure when seeing their own team do well			1
when a third neutral team was introduced into the equation , fans showed little reaction whatsoever to their fortunes			1
but they were happy when their rival team lost to the neutral team - showing pure @entity19 , according to researchers .			1

@entity13 studied the emotion known as ' @entity19 '
the study was inspired by sports fans reveling in rivals ' misfortunes
