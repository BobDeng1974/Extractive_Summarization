@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 admits he would love to finally make his @entity2 - 11 years after first joining @entity3			1
the 28 - year - old spent five years at @entity5 as a youngster but tasted just 15 minutes of first - team action			2
he was brought back to the club in the summer to provide back up to @entity9 and @entity10 and was at last given his first start for the @entity12 in saturday 's 1 - 0 win against @entity14 as @entity3 booked a place in the @entity17 fourth round			1
@entity0 ( above ) wants to earn a starting spot for @entity3 ahead of the cup semi-final against @entity21 @entity0 deputised in place of the injured @entity23 and @entity9 in the 1 - 0 win over @entity14 but news of that victory was immediately overshadowed as @entity27 were paired with bitter @entity29 rivals @entity21 in an explosive @entity31 semi-final			1
@entity0 may not even make the bench for that game - due to be played on either january 31 or february 1 next year - with @entity10 now recovered from the head knock which kept him out against the @entity36 due to be back in action early in the new year after shoulder surgery			1
but the @entity39 insists he will be ready to face @entity41 's hoops if called upon			0
@entity0 said : " i 'm sure this is a draw that will excite the boys - i 'm probably the wrong person to ask because i 've only been here a few months			2
" i was only on the bench for one @entity29 game during my first stint here			0
that was back in 2006 or something and we lost 2 - 0			1
" but i would love to be part of something like that			0
" @entity23 ( above ) has been unavailable after needing hospital treatment when he collided with the post @entity9 ( above ) should return from shoulder surgery to be available for when @entity3 face @entity21 @entity3 saw off the sons for the second time in a week thanks to @entity60 's third goal in five games			2
the former @entity63 striker clipped the ball in off the post a minute before half - time after a great spot by @entity68 set him up - leaving the goalscorer to praise the 20 - year - old for another moment of brilliance			0
@entity60 - who watched @entity68 head home the winner against @entity75 on tuesday night to set up the @entity76 - said : " we 've seen the performances @entity79 has put in in the past couple of months			0
@entity60 ( left ) and @entity81 ( right ) celebrate @entity60 's goal as @entity3 won 1 - 0 against @entity14 " he 's a fantastic talent and as long as he keeps working hard at his game and learning , developing and listening he can go far			1
" he 's a fantastic young kid with a bright future but the most important thing for him is to keep doing the right things			0
" but when you see him on a field he 's a joy to watch and you feel that every time he picks up the ball something is going to happen			0
