by @entity0 published : 18:08 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 2 april 2013 she certainly knows how to climb a tree			1
and , as the glossy @entity5 photos demonstrate , @entity3 can also pull off a passable impression of a chattering primate			1
but is her exotic life story bananas ? that ’s for you to decide			1
the housewife , who lives in @entity12 , has spoken publicly for the first time about a bizarre chain of events that — she claims — saw her raised in a @entity18 rainforest by capuchin monkeys			1
jungle behaviour : @entity3 who says she was raised by capuchin monkeys mrs @entity3 , a grandmother who was born in @entity21 in the @entity22 , says she spent five years of her childhood living with a ‘ family ’ of the tree - dwelling monkeys in the north - east of the country			1
in a memoir published later this month , she says she was four years old when kidnappers abducted her from the garden of her family home and left her for dead in a rainforest			1
two days after she was abandoned , mrs @entity3 ( who moved to the @entity33 as an adult ) says a group of monkeys discovered her lying alone , ‘ curled up on the ground in despair ’			1
they soon began looking after her , she says			1
some fought off hostile predators , issuing ‘ screams			2
so intense and horrific that i hid under a bush ’			2
others taught her how to survive by scavenging bananas , figs , nuts and other wild food			2
over time , she says she developed ‘ dry , leathery ’ skin and powerful ‘ sinewy ’ arms and legs , learned how to sleep in a ‘ hollowed - out piece of tree trunk ’ , and discovered an ability to communicate in their rudimentary language			2
monkey love : it is believed that the monkeys who took care of @entity3 in the forest were weeper capuchins ‘ i imitated the noises the monkeys made for my own amusement , ’ mrs @entity3 recalls			1
‘ but i soon realised that sometimes a monkey — or several monkeys — would respond			2
‘ so i practised the sounds that they made			2
if there was an immediate danger their call would be even higher — a sharp , high - pitched scream , which was usually accompanied by the slapping of hands on the ground			2
’ the claims , made public when a portion of mrs @entity3 ’s autobiography , @entity3 , was serialised yesterday in @entity82 , have met with a mixed reaction from primate experts			1
‘ i can accept that a four - year - old child could imitate the feeding behaviour of wild capuchin monkeys and that they would not harm the child , ’ the zoologist @entity85 tells me			2
‘ in that way she could just about have survived			2
i have myself hand - fed wild capuchins in a forest in @entity95			1
’ but , @entity85 adds , ‘ the idea that they might have helped me in any way seems far - fetched ’			2
in one remarkable passage of the book , mrs @entity3 , who does not know her exact age , but believes she is now in her 60s , claims one of the elder monkeys saved her life after she had eaten some poisonous berries			1
the animal , who she gave the nickname ‘ @entity111 ’ , led her to a muddy stream and submerged her head to demonstrate that she should drink the brackish water			2
‘ i began coughing and then vomiting — great heaving gouts of acid liquid that burned my throat , ’ she recalls			2
though highly unpleasant , ‘ the purging worked ’ , she believes , because it forced the poisoned berries from her stomach			2
living among the monkeys , mrs @entity3 found herself ‘ growing filthier and filthier , ’ and ‘ scratching more and more			1
i became home for all manner of little creatures			2
not only was my skin growing drier and scalier , i was also soon crawling with fleas ’			2
after what she estimates to have been five years , she was rescued from the jungle by a party of hunters who drove her to @entity132 , a large city in the north - east of @entity21 near the @entity135 border			1
there , aged nine , she began calling herself @entity137			2
after narrowly escaping being sold into prostitution , she spent her teenage years with a group of homeless street children in an organised petty crime ring			0
wild child : @entity137 at home in @entity144 , @entity145 , in 2009 , climbing onto a tree - trunk hole , similar to those in which she would find a bed during her time in the jungle later , she found work as a housekeeper			0
her initial employer abused her			0
but she was then taken in by the working - class family of a local woman called @entity156 , who found her work with some cousins in @entity159			0
the family , who worked in textiles , later attempted to emigrate to the @entity33			0
in 1978 , they spent six months in @entity12 , where she met and fell in love with @entity164 , the organist at an evangelical church where she worshipped			0
they married shortly afterwards , when @entity167 was in her late 20s , had two daughters , and for the ensuing three decades have lived inconspicuously in tidy , three - bedroom semi in @entity171 , a suburb of @entity12			0
mrs @entity3 ’s bizarre but incredible story only emerged last october , after she signed to @entity173 , a well - known @entity174 literary agent who has represented everyone from @entity176 and @entity177 to @entity178 and @entity179			1
@entity173 negotiated a lucrative book deal with the publisher mainstream , and arranged for @entity182 , an author who is also one of his clients , to ghost - write the manuscript			0
rights to @entity137 ’s autobiography have now been sold in seven countries			0
initial coverage of the book deal saw mrs @entity3 widely compared to @entity190 , the young protagonist in @entity191 , along with @entity192 , the baby bought up by apes in the novel by @entity195			1
but the unlikely nature of her tale also sparked understandable scepticism			0
there is , after all , little to corroborate the claims about her five years in the jungle , and cynics have wondered if the tale has been spectacularly embellished as part of a lucrative hoax			1
they point out that there is no contemporary coverage of her disappearance or survival story			0
and some sceptics have also noted that the average four - year - old girl is far larger than the capuchin monkeys who allegedly ‘ adopted ’ mrs @entity3			1
however , despite extensive investigations , no evidence has been unearthed to definitively prove that her tale is a fantasy			0
indeed , most primate experts say it has at least half a ring of truth to it , since capuchins are generally well - disposed to humans			1
one of the generally - cuddly animals was for a time owned by @entity226 , the character played by @entity228 in the tv sitcom friends			0
another is currently the property of pop singer @entity232			0
‘ some aspects of the story might indeed be true , as monkeys and humans share some similar facial displays , cognitive abilities and behaviours , and can indeed ‘ bond ’ together quite tightly , if the right conditions occur , ’ says dr @entity233 , a primate expert from the @entity234			0
‘ however , some other aspects are pure fantasy			0
for example , i do n’t think there is any evidence of “ active ” teaching in monkeys and some of the explanations for the events described in her story appear to be very anthropomorphic — ascribing human emotions and feelings to monkeys			0
’ whatever the truth , occasional cases of children being raised by primates have certainly been documented in the past			1
family tree : @entity137 and her husband @entity264 with their two daughters @entity268 , left , and @entity269 , far right , in in @entity270 , in 2012 in 1991 , the ‘ @entity275 monkey boy , ’ six - year - old @entity271 , was rescued after three years in the wild , being cared for by vervet monkeys			0
and in 1996 , a two - year - old @entity276 called @entity277 was found living with chimpanzees			0
mrs @entity3 ’s claim to have been kidnapped also seems vaguely credible			1
though the apparent date of the abduction , in 1954 , pre-dates @entity21 ’s civil war , child kidnappings were commonplace in the region at the time			1
friends add that if her story is an invention then it certainly is n’t a recent one : she has been privately talking about her extraordinary experiences for decades			0
in october , a sunday newspaper travelled to @entity21 and tracked down @entity292 , the granddaughter of the woman who ‘ rescued ’ mrs @entity3 in @entity132 in the @entity294			1
@entity292 recalled how ‘ @entity297 ’ had often shared her story of being raised by monkeys			1
at the time , the future mrs @entity3 would like to spend her afternoons sitting in the branches of a mango tree			1
‘ it was such a curious thing , ’ recalled ms @entity292			0
‘ she would hang out in that tree			0
not just in the branches , but high up , right at the top			0
’ after moving to @entity145 and starting a family , mrs @entity3 worked part - time at the @entity306 , and at a local nursery , remained active in her evangelical church , and started a small catering company			1
she never shared her remarkable story with colleagues and neighbours , perhaps because her @entity313 was n’t quite up to it , but often discussed it with her husband , a bacteriologist , and daughters @entity268 and @entity269			0
their mother ’s past was evident in her child - rearing techniques , they recall			0
‘ when we wanted food , we ’d have to make noises for it , ’ her younger daughter , @entity268 , has said			0
on occasion , mrs @entity3 would bring furry mammals into the house , including rabbits , which she caught in hedgerows using her bare hands			1
‘ i got bedtime stories about the jungle , as did my sister			0
we did n’t think it odd — it was just @entity339 telling her life			0
so in a way it was nothing special having a mother like that			0
’ it was @entity268 , who works in tv , who persuaded mrs @entity3 to write an account of her childhood			1
it ended up in mr @entity173 ’s hands after she cold - called his agency			0
even if the tale is invented , mrs @entity3 was n’t motivated by greed : her proceeds from publication of the book have been promised to a charity that works with street children			1
meanwhile , the @entity360 is now planning a documentary in which they will return to the jungles of @entity363 with mrs @entity3			1
perhaps she ’ll meet a few old friends .			0
