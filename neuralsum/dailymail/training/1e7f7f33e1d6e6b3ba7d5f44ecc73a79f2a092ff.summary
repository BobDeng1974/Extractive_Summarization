a painting by @entity1 of dr @entity2 , who is to be honoured with a plaque at @entity4 one of @entity7 's greatest @entity6 explorers , whose reputation was trashed when he reported cannibalism within a lost @entity7 crew , will be honoured with a plaque at @entity4			1
dr @entity2 was sent to the @entity6 to find out what had happened to sir @entity14 and his crew - who went missing in 1846 - and made a discovery so shocking it was refused by the establishment			1
@entity20 tribesmen told dr @entity2 that @entity14 's men has starved to death and resorted to eating each other after their ships got trapped in the ice			1
after three journeys across the @entity6 , dr @entity2 reported back , saying that the men had ' been driven to the last dread alternative as a means of supporting life '			1
his unfavourable findings were widely criticised and led to him being completely discredited - @entity33 wrote a two - part essay theorising that it had actually been the @entity20 who killed @entity14 's men - and his version became the accepted story			1
in his essays , @entity33 wrote about the ' firmness , fortitude and courage ' of the crew , compared with the @entity20 - a ' gross handful of uncivilised people , with a domesticity of blood and blubber ' , the @entity47 reports			2
the successful campaign to sully dr @entity2 's account was started by @entity14 's widow , and he never recovered from it - he was the only @entity53 explorer who was not knighted			1
the mantle of having discovered the @entity56 was also given to @entity14 - despite many believing that dr @entity2 actually found it			1
while shunned in his time , dr @entity2 is now recognised as one of the country 's great explorers , and a plaque with his name is to be unveiled in the @entity64 next week			1
an 1845 illustration from the @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 ( left ) an artist 's impression of @entity67 , one of sir @entity73 's ships , trapped in @entity6 ice it has been placed below a bust of @entity77 - to show reconciliation - and the unveiling ceremony will be attended by relatives of both explorers			2
sir @entity14 , who led the ill - fated @entity56 expedition which resulted in his crew members becoming cannibals and all eventually dying also in attendance will be author @entity86 - who helped restore @entity14 's reputation with his book , ' @entity88 '			1
the very rev @entity89 , @entity90 , told @entity47 : ' we are very keen on reconciliation here , ' adding that @entity4 would not be joining the debate about who discovered the @entity56 - a sea route which goes through the @entity97			2
modern historians largely believe it was dr @entity2 who made the discovery , and @entity104 explorer @entity102 - the first explorer to sail the passage - also gives him the credit			0
his reports of cannibalism were all but confirmed back in 1997 , when bones from some of the explorers who died were found on @entity113 with cuts on them - implying that flesh had been sliced off them			0
@entity118 , dr @entity2 's great great grand - niece , will attend next week 's ceremony , and said : ' @entity2 survived because he got to know the @entity20 ways and he looked after his own men			0
he only lost one person in the whole of his @entity6 journeys			0
' every member of @entity14 's crew died in the @entity6 after spending years in icy conditions			1
one of his ships was recently found in @entity130 in northern @entity131			0
@entity2 is one of @entity7 's great @entity6 explorers , but was largely discredited in his time because of the reports he brought back about sir @entity14 's crew - which he had been sent out in search of - resorting to cannibalism after becoming trapped in the ice			1
he was a @entity139 doctor who took three trips to the @entity97 - between 1948 and 1951 - and is credited by many modern - day historians with discovering the @entity56 - a sea route through the @entity97 along the coast of @entity144			0
the first of these three trips took him from the @entity146 to the @entity147 , on the second he was thwarted by ice as he tried to cross to @entity150 and on the final expedition he managed to explore the whole south coast of @entity130 island - in @entity131			0
as well as exploring the @entity6 , dr @entity2 also travelled to the @entity154 , north west of the @entity155 , and other parts of northern @entity131			2
he met the @entity20 who told him of @entity14 's fate near @entity158 after leaving @entity159 on march 31 , 1854			0
one of the @entity20 had a gold cap - band , and told him that he had got it from the body of one white man among around 35 who had starved to death			0
he continued his explorations before meeting more inuits in may			0
they communicated to him that they had met @entity14 's crew four years before , and that , when they saw them again the following spring , around 30 men were dead and there were signs of cannibalism			2
despite not getting knighted , he did leave behind a legacy after his death in 1893 - at the age of 79			0
@entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 - all in @entity131 or the @entity6 - are among the landmarks named after him .			0

@entity2 was sent to find crew of sir @entity14 lost in @entity6
discovered that they had reported to cannibalism and reported back
but had reputation trashed and story discredited by @entity33
to be honoured with plaque at @entity4 next week
