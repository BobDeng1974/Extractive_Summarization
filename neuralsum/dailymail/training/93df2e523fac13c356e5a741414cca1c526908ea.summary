by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 18 july 2013 @entity2 authorities are baffled after an investigation into the spike in a rare birth defect in several neighboring counties has failed to uncover a common cause			1
the counties of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 all reported an unusually high rate of anencephalic pregnancies between january 2010 and january 2013			1
the @entity14 in conjunction with local health authorities and the @entity17 examined records to determine risk factors in the cases of anencaphaly but has not found a common cause			2
rare : anencephaly only affects one or two births per 10,000 in the @entity25 @entity26 occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy			2
during that time , the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus			0
this process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies , resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain , skull and scalp			1
babies born with anencephaly are usually blind , deaf , unconcious and unable to feel pain			1
they are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer			0
the rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births			2
the rate in the @entity2 counties is eight per 10,000 births			1
the condition : a baby born with anencephaly lacks the telencephalon , encompassing the part of the brain responsible for cognition baffled : authorities are unsure why the @entity2 counties of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are reporting higher than average rates of anencephaly it 's a significant jump for such a rare condition and prompted the @entity14 study			1
according to the @entity14 , anencephaly and a related spinal cord disorder , spina bifida , can be caused by a lack of the b - vitamin folic acid in the mother ’s diet			0
other factors include certain medications , diabetes , pre-pregnancy obesity , or previously having a child with a neural tube defect			0
defect : @entity26 occurs in the early weeks of pregnancy in @entity2 , health investigators looked at family history , pre-pregnancy weight , health risk behaviors such as supplemental folic acid and medication use , and whether the mother ’s residence received drinking water from a public or private source			1
they found no common exposures , conditions or causes among the cases of anencephaly , and no significant differences between healthy pregnancies and anencephalic births			1
@entity99 officials have said the higher rate of anencephaly could be pure coincidence			2
the @entity14 will continue to monitor births in the region throughout 2013 to see if the rate of anencephaly remains raised , and whether any further causes can be identified			2
dr. @entity108 , director of @entity109 at @entity110 in @entity111 , told @entity112 that anencephaly can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors			0
' the interesting thing with this study is that they looked at different factors , and women 's histories , and obesity , and at medical history and could n't find anything that stood out , ' she said			0
' could it be a fluke ? we do n't know			0
it could take time to uncover some sort of [ unusual ] exposure			0
' according to the @entity133 , women of child - bearing age should take 400 - 1000 micrograms of folic acid daily , either from foods fortified with folic acid or a supplement .			0

three @entity2 counties have reported an unusually high rate of anencephaly
anencephalic babies are born without a large portion of the brain , skull and scalp
the *prognosis* for babies born with anencephaly is death
authorities have not been able to establish a common cause for the high rate of the defect
