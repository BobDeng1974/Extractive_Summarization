' people get quite fraught about it			2
' nerves are made worse by celebrity mothers such as @entity38 , @entity24 and @entity25 - all of whom invariably look perfect during the school run , no matter how much work they have on			0

' according to @entity77 , a bouncy blow dry worn with dark sunglasses says ' do n't talk to me ' , while skyscraper heels tell fellow mothers that you ca n't be bothered to run after your child			1
