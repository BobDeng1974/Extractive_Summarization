he called himself ' @entity1 ' and delighted in making his classmates give him the ' @entity3 to victory - salute beloved of his idol @entity5			2
@entity6 , 15 , has emerged as one of two ringleaders of a class of grammar school children in @entity11 who worshipped at the dark side - disciples of a regime that vanished in fire and blood nearly seven decades ago			1
@entity6 and his cohorts are the stuff of nightmares for modern - day democrats in @entity22 's most economically powerful country : educated , middle class , kitted out with the latest in @entity24 and teen - fashion who nonetheless prefer the darkest days of their nation 's past as a source of inspiration for the future			1
a pupil raises his right hand in the @entity5 salute at @entity36 in eastern @entity11 @entity37 in eastern @entity11 has become the town of ' @entity39 ' , a group of 29 youngsters who authorities say some - or even most - worshipped at the shrine of @entity5			1
recently their sordid world blew apart when the photos the 15 - year - olds of class 9a of the @entity36 posted on the @entity49 social media site were published			1
@entity6 can be seen raising his right hand in the @entity5 salute , his face obscured with a stuck - on @entity5 moustache			1
he and a pal called @entity55 - who nicknamed himself ' @entity56 ' after @entity57 - are now under the microscope of the authorities			2
@entity57 is the infamous jew - baiting pervert of @entity11 who was hanged at @entity62 after the war for his crimes in conditioning an entire nation to think and act anti-semitically at all times all 29 children in the class were signed into the @entity49 chatroom where the lurid messages of support for @entity5 and his henchmen , along with vile @entity75 slurs , were traded on a daily basis in the chatroom the students glorified @entity5 and shared @entity11 greetings , slogans and the odd @entity75 joke all 29 children in the class - who had visited a concentration camp in @entity11 to learn about the crimes of the @entity11 - were signed into the @entity49 chatroom where the lurid messages of support for @entity5 and his henchmen , along with vile @entity75 slurs , were traded on a daily basis			1
@entity87 travelled to this tiny , shell - shocked town of 12,000 people , which is now the centre of a full - blown criminal probe because the adulation of the @entity93 , and the public display of their symbols and salutes , is a grave crime in modern - day @entity11			1
it seems that the warning signs were either ignored or misread by teachers of the @entity11 - virus growing within their young charges			1
another youngster from the 9a class makes the @entity107 salute in an image shared on social media lurid messages of support for @entity5 , along with vile @entity75 slurs , were traded on a daily basis a school insider , a clerk in the administration office , said : ' shortly before the holidays the teacher gave the class an art lesson and they were allowed to paint what they wanted			2
' when she returned she was horrified to find many of them had chosen to paint portraits of @entity5			0
' in the chatroom the students shared @entity11 greetings , slogans , the fact that @entity5 was a ' great man ' and the odd anti-jewish ' joke '			1
one of the last postings before authorities shut down their account was the picture of a clenched fist surrounded by a ring of stars and the words : ' @entity93 ' - in the mood for @entity93			2
school headmaster @entity140 said the entire school had been shocked about the secret @entity11 sympathisers they routinely greeted each other in cyberspace with ' @entity107 ! ' they used words like ' @entity147 ' and ' @entity148 ' - the racist speak of the @entity93 - and they lauded recent racist attacks in @entity11 , such as the firebombing of a synagogue in @entity153 , as ' acts of resistance			1
' a @entity157 dad has filed a complaint with police asking them to investigate ' @entity39 ' a legal complaint was made by @entity163 man @entity162 , 54 , who has a son in the class			1
@entity162 , the former head of the local @entity166 , added : ' i thought it was a bad dream when i opened newspapers and read the article			0
' my boy told me that on the hood of his jacket someone had stuck a far - right @entity175 [ @entity175 ] sticker			2
it was well - known it seems that he was @entity163			2
' it was on this basis that i have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation			0
he said however that he was equally surprised that his son had not discussed the matter with him , and added that there had been tremendous peer pressure to stop anybody in the class mentioning what they were up to			2
he added : ' even after i read about it , i found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on			0
it was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true			0
' @entity200 knows about the blind , unreasoning , ignorant hatred of the far right because it was visited upon the family home only recently			0
the @entity207 awoke to find slogans dating back to the @entity206 - the - so - called @entity206 of november 9 1938 - daubed upon the walls of their house			1
it started with the ransacking of @entity163 property and the burning of synagogues , and ended with the burning of people , some six million of them , in places like @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223			2
that is why for @entity162 , and for all the good burghers of @entity37 , it is so incomprehensible to think that their children could be attracted to the politics of the @entity11 beasts from so long ago			1
' only after intense discussion did my son acknowledge that , in principle , the newspaper articles are correct , ' he said with a sad shake of his head			0
according to police sources the @entity239 ! and @entity238 ! went far beyond mere larking about			0
one officer said : ' they spoke about being " pure @entity147 folk " , which is something straight out of the @entity11 lexicon , and said they wanted to work towards building a @entity247			1
' school insiders say the writing has been on the wall for years			0
@entity251 in general remains blighted by higher unemployment and lower opportunities than the rest of the country - a fertile breeding ground for far - right parties like the @entity175 which has been trawling outside the school gates in recent years to sign up youngsters to their twisted cause			0
and one told @entity87 that in a mock classroom ballot earlier this year , meant to emulate the @entity267 elections , a ' worryingly high ' number of 9a pupils voted for the @entity175 - a party that wants to kick out all foreigners from @entity11 and promote the kind of ' folk superiority ' that the original @entity93 did all those years ago			1
@entity271 , the state in which @entity37 lies , has had a @entity274 problem for years			1
the state elections in 2011 saw close to 50,000 people voting for the @entity175 which only narrowly failed to enter parliament			0
media commentators say the police and government authorities have not done enough to combat right - wing extremism , which has festered especially in depopulated rural regions of the east where neo-nazis sit on town councils , organize local sports festivals and youth activities and are even trying to staff kindergartens			1
@entity140 , the director of the @entity37 school , is said by friends to be ' devastated ' by the antics of class 9a			1
' now everything is on the table and we must find out who wrote what , who photographed what , who uploaded what and so on , ' said @entity302			0
but he said he did not want to instantly accuse the children , adding : ' breaking taboos is part of young adulthood			0
i do n't believe that they wanted to actively promote @entity274 ideology			0
' prosecutor @entity310 , 59 , has confirmed that they are investigating allegations of glorifying the crimes of the @entity11 and that an investigation was currently underway into at least four pupils in the class			1
@entity11 regards any glorification of the @entity11 including the use of @entity5 salutes as illegal and punishable by jail terms , though in this case the age of the pupils is also expected to be taken into account			2
after intense pressure from parents and the school , the children of @entity325 issued an apology on @entity330 for their actions			0
a pupil raises his right hand in the @entity5 salute , his face obscured with a stuck - on @entity5 moustache they said : ' we , as class 9a from the @entity36 , apologise for everything that has been published which has caused our school damage , and that which is still to come			2
these were ill considered actions which we are not able to make up for			0
' furthermore , it was not the whole class which was responsible			0
that 's why we would like to apologize , even to our uninvolved classmates			0
' they accused the @entity353 newspaper in @entity11 , which broke the story , of ' twisting ' facts ' but want to apologise for these anyway , even if they were not meant seriously			2
and we promise that never again will there be such behaviour in the class of 9a again			0
' it was signed on behalf of ' all those responsible '			0
but the reasons for the allure of history 's most murderous regime remain , so far , unexplained			0
the @entity36 in eastern @entity11 - now known as the home of ' @entity39 '			1

@entity6 , 15 , has emerged as a ringleader of group of @entity11 - worshiping teens
@entity87 travelled to @entity37 in @entity11 - town of ' @entity39 '
the tiny town of 12,000 people is now the centre of a full criminal probe
many - of even all - of the children in class @entity379 worshipped at shrine of @entity381
they used chatroom to trade @entity11 greetings , slogans and anti-jewish jokes
