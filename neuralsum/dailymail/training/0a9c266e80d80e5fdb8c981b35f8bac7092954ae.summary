@entity0 has opened up about the @entity2 slip that halted @entity5 's @entity4 momentum and went a long way to depriving them of their first league title in 24 years			1
@entity5 lost 2 - 0 to @entity10 in their third - to - last game of the 2013/14 season , and @entity2 's error to gift @entity15 's goal loosened their grip on the title			1
the @entity19 then let a three - goal lead slip at @entity21 , before a win against @entity23 on the last day of the season ; by then though , the title had gone to @entity25			1
@entity0 , in his new autobiography released on thursday , has revealed his thoughts on that title - changing moment at @entity31			2
@entity2 's slip gifts @entity15 the ball , which he duly accepted to score for @entity10 last april it was the moment that took the momentum from @entity5 , and halted their charge for the @entity4 @entity5 went to @entity38 in their following match , and squandered a 3 - 0 lead to draw 3 - 3 with @entity21 ' if i had been in @entity43 's shoes , i do n't know if i would have been able to carry on playing			1
emotionally , it must have been very , very hard			0
' in the previous weeks , so much had been said about him , the expectation had built so much , the talk had been about him leading @entity5 , his club , to a first title in over 20 years , on the 25th anniversary of the @entity52 disaster , in which his cousin had died , and then that happens			2
' the captain , the former youth - teamer , the one - club man , a @entity58 born and bred , and he was the unlucky one to make a crucial mistake			0
' i 'm convinced that if @entity10 had not scored like that , they would not have scored at all			0
and once you are a goal down against them , it 's virtually impossible			0
' @entity0 enjoyed some incredible moments at @entity31 , pictured ( left ) alongside strike partner @entity66 @entity0 is now plying his trade in @entity68 for @entity69 ; pictured vs @entity70 in the @entity71 this week @entity0 left @entity5 at the end of that season , moving to @entity69 for Â£ 75 million , and this saturday his old side , @entity2 included , will host @entity10 for the first time since the incident at the back end of last season			1
things are different this time , with an unbeaten @entity10 very much the team in control			2
@entity83 's side have won eight and drawn two of their first 10 @entity4 matches			0
there is a long way to go , but @entity5 need a turning point in their season if they are to awake from their poor start , which sees them currently in seventh place in the @entity4 .			0

@entity2 gifted @entity15 a goal at the back end of last season
that paved the way for @entity5 to *surrender* the title to @entity25
@entity0 says he could not have carried on playing if it were him
@entity5 play @entity10 for the first time since the incident on saturday
