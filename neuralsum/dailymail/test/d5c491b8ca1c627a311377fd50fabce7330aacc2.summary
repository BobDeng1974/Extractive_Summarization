@entity0 has published @entity2 regulations for next season confirming a seeding change to reward national league winners			1
top - seeded teams in eight groups will be the defending @entity2 winner plus title holders in the seven highest - ranked countries			1
on current standings , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 will drop in status in the august 27 draw			0
@entity11 , who were knocked out by @entity18 this season , could drop down in the pots for the group stages @entity22 look to be marching towards the @entity24 title so would stay in pot 1 if @entity27 do n't win @entity28 or the @entity2 they will be in pot 2 next season if things stay as they are in @entity30 ... @entity2 winner @entity32 @entity33 @entity22 @entity34 @entity35 @entity36 @entity37 @entity27 would also drop down if @entity32 wins the @entity2 and @entity39 league			1
if the @entity2 winner also wins its national title , then the eighth top - seeded team is the @entity42 champions			2
that is @entity44 , which is only 30th in @entity0 's club standings			0
currently , top - seeded teams are the eight highest - ranked in a five - year results cycle in @entity0 competitions			2
the new system should elevate league - leading @entity34 and @entity36 , plus @entity52 's champions			0
@entity13 are trailing @entity37 in @entity53 so would also miss out on pot 1 in the @entity2 @entity44 would benefit if the winners of the @entity2 also won their domestic title			0

top - seeded teams in @entity2 groups will be title holders
top seven league winners will be *joined* by the holders of the competition
change in regulations would mean @entity11 and @entity13 drop down
@entity12 and @entity27 also face drop from top group
@entity22 would stick as top seeds if they win the @entity24
