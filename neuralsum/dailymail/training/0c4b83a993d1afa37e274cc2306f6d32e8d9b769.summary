by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has hailed the performances of goalkeepers at this summer 's @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity2 , who was in goal for @entity9 's 1966 triumph , is enjoying the recognition that his peers are getting in @entity12			1
the 76 - year - old cited the improvements made by goalkeepers at this @entity5 in comparison to four years ago in @entity17 when many stuggled to deal with the much - maligned @entity20 football			0
happy viewing : @entity2 has hailed the displays of goalkeepers at the @entity5 safe hands : @entity25 gained many plaudits for his goalkeeping performances for the @entity28 in @entity6 beaten away : @entity29 proved @entity31 's quarter - final shootout hero against @entity32 saving two penalties ‘ it has been a great @entity5 for goalkeepers and it ’s nice to see so many get recognition this year , ' the @entity35 ambassador said			1
' i do n’t think the balls are moving round as much as they have done in recent tournaments so the keepers can save shots properly rather than just having to parry them			0
' there have been some wonderful displays , @entity25 who i have always rated highly , made over a dozen good saves versus @entity51 and there was the @entity54 keeper [ @entity55 ] @entity53 who made a handful of saves against @entity6 including one which was compared to my effort against @entity60 back in 1970			2
' banks , who won 73 international caps for the @entity9 , also higlighted the performances of @entity64 and @entity29 who have caught his eye			2
@entity64 has started every game for @entity6 despite falling behind club team - mate @entity68 in the @entity71 pecking order , while @entity29 proved @entity31 's hero in their quarter - final penalty shootout win against @entity32 - coming on as an extra-time substitute before saving two spot - kicks			0
' @entity6 ’s @entity64 , who is not even first choice for @entity71 has been playing very well and helped beat @entity77 on penalties in the last sixteen , ' he added			0
' then there was @entity29 ’s performance for @entity31 versus @entity32			0
i have never seen anything like that – a keeper coming on for the shootout - but it clearly worked and whether it was mind games for the players when the substitution was made or when he was shouting at the penalty players before they took their kick , it worked ! ' all smiles : @entity64 has been one of @entity6 's star performers in their run to the semi-finals of the @entity5 proud moment : banks ( far left ) was part of @entity9 's @entity5 winning squad in 1966			1
