both were also convicted , and jailed , for sexual activity with the vulnerable teenager			1
cleared of charge : @entity7 , 65 , and @entity8 , 59 , had their convictions of causing or inciting involvement in child pornography overturned as their live streaming of sex sessions was not permanent but after the pornography ruling was quashed by the @entity27 , a retrial at @entity29 ended with a jury being directed to return not guilty verdicts			1
the ruling came after it was judged the live streaming of the pair 's sex sessions with their victim did not fit the legal definition of pornography , which must be recorded in a permanent form			1
directing the jury to clear the pair , judge @entity41 said : ' these defendants have been convicted of sex offences			2
' in regards to these charges it is a legal technicality we are dealing with it is important if someone is going to be convicted there are convicted on what the law states			0

he told them : ' you treated her not as a damaged child who needed protection , but as somebody who could be simply used as you wished			0
' you involved her in sexual activity which must have had the effect of damaging her even further			2
' of the live streaming , the judge said : ' in addition to the degradation of that child , she knows an unknown number of people have had the opportunity to view that degradation			2
' a third man , @entity63 , 49 , of @entity64 , was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions			0
