it used to drive @entity2 daft when his @entity4 squads were dissected along provincial lines - @entity1 bias was the undercurrent which annoyed him most			1
come @entity10 ’s ascension to the @entity4 throne , the allegations changed from red to blue with the @entity15 ’s @entity14 connections leaving him open to allegations that he favours his old province			2
such mutterings are unfair : @entity2 will tell you he picked on form and @entity10 will claim likewise			2
yet , despite their natural reservations about the national squad getting analysed along parochial lines , it is still an instructive exercise in the sense that it ’s a firm indicator as to how well or not a province is travelling			2
@entity1 and @entity29 ( centre ) are flying high and sit top of the @entity32 after nine games same as they are now , @entity1 , a year ago , were on top of the @entity32 table after nine rounds - but there the similarity between the then and now ends			1
back then their players were playing in fits and starts			2
this inconsistency shackled their @entity46 performances in defeat to @entity48 and in fortunate victory over @entity50 and the price paid was having just a meagre total of four players capped by an unimpressed @entity10 in the november 2013 @entity55 series			2
that selection pattern followed through into the @entity57 , @entity4 clinching the title in @entity59 with a 23 - man squad featuring just three @entity1 players			1
however , turn the dial forward towards the end of 2014 and , with @entity1 doubling up in @entity46 against @entity65 and @entity66 following a successful @entity68 raid against @entity14 , the representative rewards were bountiful last month			1
ten @entity1 players were capped during the recent three - game @entity70 , eight as starters , and further evidence of their growing influence on the national team was evident in how eight of their players featured in the 23 chosen against @entity78 in the series finale			1
that generous representation means they are already a year ahead of the objective stated in the strategic plan launched last may where the hope was to provide 30 per cent or more to any @entity85 national team by 2015/16			1
@entity86 has led @entity1 well and they are a year ahead of schedule in their development eight in 23 is effectively 35 per cent , and while that had the consequence of seeing more players away from @entity1 at a time in the season when they were plotting for the 10 - match winter window that will decide their @entity46 fate and see their top spot in the league come under pressure ( the sequence started in @entity101 the night before @entity4 beat @entity78 ) , coach @entity86 ( right ) is n’t overly concerned by the increased demands			1
‘ i ’m not complaining , ’ he says			2
‘ if you are supplying those players they are obviously playing well			2
we are obviously doing well in competitions so it ’s important to keep that going to try and kick on and get a couple of more in there ( in the national set - up ) without shooting ourselves in the foot altogether			0
‘ it ’s important for us and important for the @entity1 psyche that we supply players to the national side and that the national side is successful			1
’ skipper @entity118 believes the increased representation has had an uplifting effect on provincial squad morale , adding that the test exposure enjoyed by so many more of his colleagues this time round is primed to stand them in good stead as they prepare to face @entity129 twice in the space of eight days , starting on saturday in @entity131			1
‘ it ’s a huge help coming back for guys to be driving standards and for guys to realise what it takes at an international stage , ’ he said on the impact of the rise in representation from four to 10			0
‘ the more people you can have around coming back to the club ( from @entity4 duty ) the better , so it was great to have more guys involved and hopefully we can keep driving that on			0
‘ it ’s the closest thing you ’re going to get to it , ’ he added on how useful that greater test exposure will be in helping @entity1 cope with the @entity129 threat			1
@entity154 teams coming over here for back - to - back games ... it does n’t get any bigger really			0
’ @entity1 race a tough test when they travel to @entity129 in the @entity159 on saturday the last time @entity118 grappled with a @entity154 outfit in @entity131 , he was gone midway through the opening half			1
a lineout steal against @entity164 back in april did n’t end happily , the back row dislocating his shoulder			0
however , while he also went on to have his other shoulder operated on during his lengthy lay - off , he insists there has been no worrying reaction during his two - month - old comeback			0
‘ no , i ’m feeling great , starting to feel normal and fit again			0
it ’s great to get a couple of 80 minutes under the belt at high intensity like that against @entity180 and @entity78			0
@entity174 just to get the fitness aspect of it done and feel good again			0
’ @entity1 ’s feel - good factor has its genesis in a seven - game winning streak that started with the early october win at @entity14 , which was @entity118 ’s first outing since his operations			1
he ’s delighted with the consistency in results but , recognising his side has enjoyed some lucky breaks — such as @entity194 ’ late missed conversion that would have won last friday ’s league game for @entity197 — he knows they must do better heading into saturday ’s showdown with @entity129			1
‘ that [ winning close games recently ] will give us a certain amount of confidence , but we have n’t been overly happy with some of the performances			0
‘ it is a confidence boost to come out of those scrappy ones with the points but , as i said , we have plenty to work on and plenty to nail off this week			0
‘ when it comes to @entity129 we have to be better all over the park			1
they ’re just such a dangerous side coming out of their 22 on a counter-attack , you name it			0
they ’ve got guys who can punish you from all areas and we have just got to everything nailed on to be competing with these guys			0
’ competing and continuing to impress @entity10 , just like they did leading into the @entity222 window .			0

@entity86 *'s* @entity1 sit top of @entity32 table after nine rounds
they face @entity129 on saturday in @entity159
@entity1 are a year ahead of schedule and are going strong right now
