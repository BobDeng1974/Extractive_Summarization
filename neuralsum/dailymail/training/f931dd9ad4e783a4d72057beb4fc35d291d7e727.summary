a controversial police campaign that ' names and shames ' hundreds of drink - drivers on @entity4 has been condemned as ' totally immoral '			1
several @entity6 police forces adopted the new scheme this @entity8 and @entity9 , in order to shame drink - drivers out of re-offending and ' scare ' would - be offenders into not getting behind the wheel			1
police publish the name , age and sometimes even the address of offenders once they have been charged - either on their website , @entity22 or @entity4			1
( file picture ) a motorist is breathalised in @entity25 , @entity26 , on @entity27 as part of the force 's crack down on drink driving but the scheme – so far adopted by @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 police forces - has been criticised by lawyers and local politicians , for undermining a defendant 's right to a fair trial			1
@entity43 , a well - known celebrity lawyer , specialising in traffic and speeding offences , said : ' naming these people before there is a guilty verdict is at best misguided ; at worst it is totally immoral			2
' naming and shaming before conviction , unless it is in the public interest to do , is ridiculous and is potentially designed to encourage vigilante action			2
' mr @entity43 , who is nicknamed ' mr loophole ' for his ability to win unlikely high - profile court cases , added : ' i have represented hundreds of clients who have been acquitted for a whole variety of different reasons			2
this means they have been found not guilty			2
' they leave court without a stain on their character			2
' if any person has been named and shamed and is ultimately acquitted they may have a substantial claim for damages against the police			1
' @entity73 , which has published the names of more than 80 drivers on @entity4 , has attracted the most controversy			2
@entity73 is one of the forces publishing names of drink drivers on @entity4 mr @entity43 has even called for the force 's commissioner @entity81 to resign over the campaign , accusing him of showing a ' cavalier disregard for the presumption of innocence '			1
@entity88 councillor @entity87 , who sits on the @entity73 and @entity89 whose job is to scrutinise mr @entity81 ' job , also condemned the scheme			1
' i think it would cause me concern if everybody that was charged was put on a public forum such as @entity4 or @entity22 , ' he said yesterday			0
' what are the consequences going to be ? ' it attaches a stigma to an individual where perhaps there might be no reason for it , they might be totally innocent			0
' the naming and shaming does n't protect lives			0
i think if i was charged i would already by thinking about the consequences			0
' @entity43 , the well - known celebrity lawyer specialising in traffic and speeding offences , has criticised the scheme councillor @entity115 , leader of the @entity116 on @entity117 , agreed , saying police have gone ' too far '			1
however , guidance from the @entity120 ( @entity120 ) states that drink drivers can be named in the media following being arrested and charged by the police			1
and mr @entity81 said he continues to back @entity33 's campaign			1
he said : ' a recent survey suggests that the proactive approach being taken in @entity33 and several other forces is raising the profile and potentially preventing people being killed or seriously injured on the roads			1
' over 60 per cent of people surveyed said that being named after charge would make them think more about the consequences of driving after having a drink , ' he said			0
meanwhile , @entity138 , founder and director of campaigning organisation , @entity137 said last night that he saw nothing wrong with naming suspects after they 've been charged			0
' this is simply a procedural matter , ' he said			0
' it is a case of a high - flying lawyer getting his knickers in a twist			0
' i suspect that mr @entity43 has a celebrity client on the verge of appearing in court following some form of driving offence and that he has been named on @entity4			0
' i doubt if it was bin men and lorry drivers he was defending he 'd be kicking up such a fuss , ' he added			0
however some say the campaign , by targeting drink drivers after they have committed a crime , is pointless because the crime has already been committed			0
as part of the @entity165 festive crackdown on drink driving , the force also offered rewards to people who reported them with payments of up to £ 200			0
@entity171 , from the @entity172 , said he thought police should instead be focusing on preventing drink driving before it happens			1
' i think most responsible motorists will prefer to encourage people not to get their keys out if they are in that condition , ' he said .			0
