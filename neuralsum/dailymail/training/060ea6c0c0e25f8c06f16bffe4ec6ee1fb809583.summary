the photo , posted on an expatriate forum by a writer using the name @entity13 , said the woman was named @entity3 and was ' a nice girl '			1
police have so far refused to formally identify the dead woman			1
other writers on the website said they recognised her face , although some questioned how ' @entity13 ' knew she was the woman who allegedly had her throat cut by 47 - year - old @entity4 , from @entity24			2
police said a @entity8 woman aged about 20 had been found naked under the bed in a room at a @entity30 hotel which @entity4 and the woman had checked into on christmas day			1
the @entity4 asked for the return of his passport at around 11pm on the night of december 28 , telling reception staff that he needed it to go to a bank to get money to pay for the room - even though banks were not open at that time of night			0
he left the hotel and never returned			2
the following morning a cleaner found the blood - covered body under the bed			2
since then there has been no sign of @entity4 , with expatriates speculating that he might have been able to cross a ' loosely - guarded ' border into a neighbouring country - most likely @entity48			0
others have suggested he is hiding out in a remote ' flophouse ' or a village where locals do not know that police are looking for him			0
one of the writers said he was certain that the woman whose photo has been posted was the local known as @entity3			1
