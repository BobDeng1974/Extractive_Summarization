it has also emerged that @entity3 - who calls himself ‘ the @entity29 ’ - also targeted @entity31 singer @entity30 by posing as his manager when the pair had only met on two occasions			1
all this was for the benefit of his tv production company , the @entity37 , which he used as a front to lure in celebrities and investors and take their money to fund his luxury lifestyle			1

ms @entity7 said : ' knowing @entity3 now , he ’s a compulsive liar , lives in a deluded land and is a serial , serial conman			1
' her partner @entity65 added : ' how low can someone go to get footage to convince people you have a television show ? ' the couple shot to fame in series nine of the @entity18 reality show big brother but their celebrity careers have since failed to take off			2
@entity7 said : ' i thought i ’d met the almighty god of the industry			2
' @entity3 promised them he could reignite their flagging careers , and bragged that he was producing a clone of @entity109 set in @entity110 , called @entity111			2
they signed a contract and began filming the documentary , opening their hearts and lives for several months			0
would n't be duped : @entity30 was approached by @entity3 , but he refused to be dragged into the scam the cameras captured their most intimate moments - including @entity7 undergoing surgery - and the pair even recorded a charity record with @entity3			1
but @entity3 ’s filming schedule pushed @entity65 and @entity7 to the limit			1

' ’ @entity145 of all you ’re not my manager			0
secondly , you ’re not my representative			0
thirdly i have only met you twice and you and i are not entering a business venture or anything like that "			0
