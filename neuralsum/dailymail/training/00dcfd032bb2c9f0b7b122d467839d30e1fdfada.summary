in the summer of 2010 , the town of @entity12 and a private company called @entity14 erected three 400 - feet - tall , 1.63 megawatt wind turbines			1
just months later , @entity16 , a 57 - year - old wedding florist , began experiencing spells of dizziness , bouts of insomnia , ringing in her ears and severe headaches			0
plaintiff : @entity16 , a 57 - year - old wedding florist , has filed a lawsuit claiming that a trio of wind turbines that were installed in her town of @entity12 , @entity5 , had made her sick too close for comfort : mrs @entity16 said that just months after the town and a private energy company installed the turbines 1,600 feet from her home , she began experiencing insomnia , dizziness and tinnitus at first , mrs @entity16 attributed her symptoms to the onset of old age , but then she noticed that whenever she was away from home , the symptoms vanished			1
‘ sometimes at night , especially in the winter , i wake up with a fluttering in the chest and think , “ what the hell is that , ” ’ and the only place it happens is at my house , ’ she told @entity45			0
@entity55 began suspecting that the culprits behind her ailments may be the trio of wind turbines whirring away day and night just 1,600 feet from her home			2
in 2011 , a doctor at @entity61 diagnosed the woman with ' wind turbine syndrome ’ - a controversial health condition that is not recognized by the @entity65			1
' @entity66 ' refers to an alleged medical disorder in which people who live in close proximity to turbines begin experiencing a wide array of symptoms , such as tinnitus , dizziness , migraines and insomnia			1
the name was coined by dr @entity78 , a pediatrician from @entity79 whose husband has been lobbying against the proliferation of wind energy			1
in 2009 , @entity83 self - published the book ' @entity66 , ' which included case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of their proximity to wind farms			1
the wind turbine syndrome , dubbed by @entity78 the green energy industry 's ' dirty little secret , ' is not recognized by the @entity65			1
@entity93 's research has come under fire from industry experts , who accused her of possibly skewing the data by looking at a small sample size without a control group and failing to submit her results for an impartial peer review			0
the name of the alleged disorder was coined by dr @entity78 , a pediatrician whose husband has been lobbying against the proliferation of wind energy			1
@entity78 self - published the book ' @entity66 syndrome ' in 2009 , providing case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of their proximity to wind turbines			1
' many people living within 2 km ( 1.25 miles ) of these spinning giants get sick			0
so sick that they often abandon ( as in , lock the door and leave ) their homes , ’ according to the book ’s description			0
‘ nobody wants to buy their acoustically toxic homes			0
' @entity78 's research has come under criticism from wind energy advocates , who claim that her data was unreliable because she used only a small sample size , had no control group , interviewed her subjects by phone and then hand - picked experts for the peer review process			1
@entity55 and her husband filed a nuisance claim against @entity14 and its owner in february , seeking between $ 150,000 and $ 300,000 in damages for the loss of their home value and medical bills			0
the lawyer representing the owner of the energy company , @entity145 , responded to the complaint by stating that @entity14 ' operating permit was ' subject to rigorous review ' and the company was in compliance with all the regulations			2
‘ scientific research and studies have shown that wind turbines such as @entity14 do not cause a nuisance or adverse health effects , ’ said attorney @entity152 in the court filing			1
according to @entity14 , in three years of operation the turbines have prevented emissions of more than 7,000 tons of carbon dioxide from conventional power plants			0
the lawyer also said that the nearest home to its turbines is located some 1,700 feet away , which is about 500 feet further away than the distance required under state law			0
wind turbines are used to generate electricity from the kinetic power of the wind			2
there are two main kinds of wind generators : those with a vertical axis , and those with a horizontal axis			0
expert opinion : a study by the @entity182 and @entity183 has concluded that wind turbines like the ones erect in @entity12 ( pictured ) present little more than an ' annoyance ' to residents most wind energy comes from turbines that can be as tall as a 20 - story building and have three 200 - foot - long blades , according to @entity192			1
the biggest wind turbines generate enough electricity to supply about 600 @entity196 homes			2
a single megawatt produced by a wind turbine is enough to power about 250 homes			0
generation of energy by wind turbines more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006 worldwide			1
@entity202 currently leads the world in the number of wind turbines , followed by @entity206 , the @entity196 , @entity207 , and @entity208			2
industry experts predict that , by 2050 a third of the world 's electricity will be generated by turbines			0
@entity214 and @entity215 , also of @entity12 , were major supporters of green energy until their town installed two turbines 1,320 and 2,320 feet away from their home			2
mr @entity221 said that within a week , he began experiencing pressure in his ears , which later turned into tinnitus , as well as shortness of breath , headaches and heart palpitations			0
the homeowner ’s wife had suffered from debilitating migraines , which she had attributed to the turbines working around the clock			0
some experts have suggested that symptoms reported by residents of towns located near turbines could be purely psychological in nature and caused by the nocebo effect - the negative reaction experienced by a patient who is exposed to a harmless substance			0
controversial figure : the name ' wind tirbune syndrome ' was coined by dr @entity78 ( left ) , who in 2009 self - published a book on the subject ( right ) with case studies of people who reportedly got sick from turbines mr @entity221 , however , insisted that his symptoms were purely physical and not the products of an overactive imagination			1
‘ just come in to my house and feel the walls shaking , ’ he said a recent study commissioned by the @entity182 and @entity183 has concluded that wind turbines present little more than an ‘ annoyance ’ to residents			2
a 2010 study conducted by the @entity263 of @entity264 found no negative effects from wind technology			0
meanwhile , @entity16 said that she was forced to move away from @entity12 and put her home , which she and her husband had built themselves , up for sale , but it 's value has dropped by half after she went public with her complaints about the nearby turbines .			2

@entity16 , 57 , is suing town of @entity12 and @entity14 claiming that their three wind turbines are behind her health *problems*
' @entity66 ' refers to alleged disorder where people who live near turbines suffer from symptoms like tinnitus and migraines
