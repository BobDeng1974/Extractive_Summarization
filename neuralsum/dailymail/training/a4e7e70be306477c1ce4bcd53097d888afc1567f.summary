by @entity0 a new robot mannequin that will help test the next generation of chemical and biological protective suits for the @entity6 's armed forces has been unveiled			1
the @entity7 can walk , march , run , sit , kneel and even mimic the movement of a soldier sighting a weapon , allowing scientists to test the suits designed to protect @entity6 personnel from chemical and biological attacks such as nerve agents like @entity18			1
the mannequin has been made for the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) in @entity21 , @entity22 - where clothing systems worn by soldiers are tested against chemical warfare agents by @entity27 - based company @entity26 the @entity29 robot mannequin is helping to test chemical and biological protective suits for the @entity6 armed forces mannequins have been used by @entity20 in the past , but the new animatronic version has a raft of improvements from a moving head , to a better range of movement , and sensors all over its body that allow scientists to carry out real - time analysis while it is being tested			1
previous models , brought into use in the late 1990s , helped influence the final design of the chemical , biological and radiological ( @entity48 ) suits currently used by the armed forces			0
scientists today said the new creation - made using @entity53 technology - will bring another ' step - change ' in the way the next generation of protective clothing is designed to keep pace with future threats			1
@entity60 , of @entity20 's @entity61 , said the new @entity7 is much lighter than its predecessor - 14kg ( 30lb ) instead of about 80kg ( 176lb ) - and easier to move in and out of its test chamber			1
the mannequin has a full range of movement such as walking , marching , running , sitting and kneeling while the previous version 's head was attached to the frame it sits in , this one has a movable head that can test the effect it has on the equipment being worn , as well as removable thumbs to make it easier to put gloves on , and ankles that flex			2
the new version also sits on a rotating turntable so it can not only be tested in windy environments created by fans , but scientists can see what happens when that wind is coming from different directions			0
the latest @entity7 also comes with software that allows scientists to programme a range of movement to fit with certain scenarios , and help test what equipment would be like dealing with real situations in the field			1
@entity60 ( right ) , of @entity20 's @entity61 , checks the @entity99 robot mannequin the new mannequin has a movable head that can test the effect it has on the equipment being worn mr @entity60 said : ' significant advances in animatronics , material design and sensing technologies have all been incorporated into this new @entity110 mannequin			0
' as a result , we will be able to assess and characterise protective clothing in ways which were not previously possibly			0
the new mannequin is hoped to help work on producing a new , lighter - weight protective suit for the future			0
the latest @entity7 comes with software that allows scientists to programme a range of movement similar to dealing with real - life situations in the field mr @entity60 added : ' it 's a better , more realistic test system , and we are now in a better position and better place to design and develop the next generation of @entity130 ( chemical and biological ) protective suit equipment			1
' the new @entity7 , which @entity20 said cost Â£ 600,000 to design and build , was made by i - bodi technology , which has made mannequins before , but draws on experience of making animatronics and robotics for films and television			2
chief executive @entity140 said they were tasked with producing a lightweight robotic mannequin based on data collected from 2,500 soldiers , that was easy to handle , had a wide range of movement			2
he said : ' of course there were a number of challenges associated with this and one way we looked to tackle these challenges was through the use of @entity53 technology			1
the new mannequin is hoped to help work on producing a new , lighter - weight protective suit for the future ' using the same concepts as those used in racing cars , we were able to produce very light but highly durable carbon composite body parts for the mannequin			0
' he added : ' we tried to make it far more realistic than the current @entity7			0
' minister for defence equipment , support and technology @entity167 said : ' this technology , designed by a @entity6 company , is enabling the @entity6 to lead the way in this important testing			2
' increased investment in science and technology by the @entity177 ( @entity177 ) is not only enabling battle - winning and lifesaving equipment to be developed but also helping innovative companies like @entity180 to develop cutting edge capability			0

the @entity7 can mimic the movement of a soldier sighting a weapon
allows scientists to test the suits designed to protect from biological attacks
suits are tested by @entity27 - based company @entity26
