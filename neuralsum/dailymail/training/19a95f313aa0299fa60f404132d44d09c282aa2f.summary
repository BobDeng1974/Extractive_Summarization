a whiter smile is seen as healthy , but with professional tooth - whitening treatments costing a minimum of £ 200 , many people turn to over-the - counter products			1
but some diy treatments have been shown to damage tooth enamel , burn gums and cause painful sensitivity			1
here , dentist @entity9 , who runs practices in @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 , @entity14 , assesses the latest offerings ; we then rated them for whitening performance and their effect on oral health			1
what 's the best @entity23 teeth - whitening treatment ? we put a selection to the test @entity27 toothpaste with led £ 7.49/50ml claims : contains @entity30 , a patented , self - cleaning ingredient that reacts with light to break down dirt and bacteria and help whiten teeth naturally			1
an led light in the neck of the toothpaste tube activates the formula as it passes through it			0
the led light can boost the formula if held in front of your mouth for one minute every day			0
@entity30 reacts to daylight , too			0
@entity46 : @entity30 is claimed to be a light - activated tooth whitener , but i can not find any sound scientific evidence to confirm it works			0
this paste contains isopropyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol - alcohol has traditionally been used in oral hygiene products to give a fresh sensation , but most manufacturers are removing it because of possible links with oral cancer			0
but this paste also contains fluoride and xylitol , both proven to reduce decay			0
fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and xylitol helps prevent bacteria sticking to teeth			1
3/10 @entity67 5 minute dissolving tooth - whitening strips £ 22.99 for one week 's supply ( 14 treatments ) claims : whiter teeth in seven days			1
these ultra-thin , flexible strips start to whiten teeth and remove stains the minute they are applied to your teeth			1
the strip dissolves in five minutes			2
@entity46 : this treatment releases chlorine dioxide , a proven dental bleaching agent , which , although it will whiten teeth , is extremely acidic			2
in high concentrations , chlorine dioxide can strip enamel from teeth , leave them permanently discoloured and sensitive to temperature			1
these strips ' ingredients could give you a sore mouth it 's not clear how much chlorine dioxide is released in these , but if it 's very small , i question how efficient their whitening effect can be			1
these strips also contain citric acid , which softens enamel , leaving teeth more vulnerable to damage and decay			1
i 'm not sure how you can use these without your lip touching them , so there 's a risk the ingredients could give you a sore mouth			1
1/10 @entity112 drops @entity113 £ 3.49/20ml claims : active oxygen boosts whiteness of your teeth			2
patented liquid calcium technology restores and strengthens enamel			2
@entity121 helps nourish and preserve healthy gums			0
after brushing your teeth in the evening , massage serum onto teeth and gums			1
@entity46 : the oxygen infused in this ' serum ' is proven to remove pigmentation from teeth and is the active ingredient in most professional teeth - whitening treatments			1
it seeps through enamel and dentine ( the hard surface of the tooth ) , clearing discoloration as it goes			2
this product has the potential to whiten teeth rather than simply remove superficial stains like most toothpastes , because of the time it stays on the teeth			2
unfortunately , the active ingredient is likely to be diluted by saliva fairly quickly			0
this paste also has calcium and phosphate - found naturally in saliva , and which protects tooth enamel from erosion - in the @entity154 , a patented ingredient , but i ca n't find sound evidence to prove this helps strengthen teeth			1
however , vitamin e is often used to help heal gums damaged by misused professional tooth - whitening products - which sometimes happens at beauty salons and whitening booths in shopping malls the sodium fluoride in this helps harden teeth and protect against decay			1
8/10 dr @entity170 £ 45/4ml claims : helps gently whiten teeth using hydrogen peroxide			2
allow gel to activate for up to 30 minutes and use twice daily			0
@entity46 : hydrogen peroxide releases oxygen into the teeth to remove deep - seated discoloration			2
this whitening agent is found in professional treatments but as this is an over-the - counter product , the percentage must be 0.1 per cent or lower , compared with up to 6 per cent in a professional product			2
there 's no real evidence hydrogen peroxide levels below 0.1 per cent are effective			2
@entity186 will dilute the gel as it sits on the teeth			2
this pricey product also contains alcohol , which has a slight drying effect on the teeth , which immediately makes them look whiter , if only for a short time			0
1/10 @entity197 dentist 's @entity195 and @entity198 £ 3.49/75ml claims : removes stains in one minute and helps prevent the signs and effects of gum disease			1
contains a unique gum - protection system , including vitamin e to invigorate and strengthen the gums , fluoride to protect the exposed root area , and permethol to help reduce and stop bleeding gums			0
this toothpaste also includes panthenol , q10 and folic acid to help promote healthy gum tissues			0
restores your teeth to a natural , white colour without using harsh abrasives or bleach			0
@entity46 : i ca n't find any whitening ingredients in this formula			1
however , the hydrated silica and sodium bicarbonate are efficient superficial stain removers - they work by gentle abrasion			0
so if teeth are stained they will appear cleaner but the underlying colour will remain the @entity232 is some evidence that panthenol reduces the bleeding caused by gum inflammation , and vitamin e can help to heal damaged gums ; @entity238 also has some anecdotal but unproven support for improving gum health			0
that said , there 's no substitute for good brushing and flossing techniques to keep gum disease at bay			0
but the fluoride here will harden up teeth against decay			0
3/10 @entity253 @entity252 £ 3.79/50ml claims : give your regular toothpaste a concentrated baking soda whitening boost			0
@entity259 @entity258 ( which you add to your usual toothpaste ) includes extreme levels of nature 's cleaning ingredient , baking soda , and the innovative enamel surface restorer , @entity154			1
together they act as a catalyst to your toothpaste and the naturally occurring minerals in saliva , restoring your enamel surface for whiter teeth			1
@entity46 : bicarbonate of soda ( baking soda ) will remove stains - but it wo n't whiten them			0
because baking soda is an abrasive , some experts say there 's a risk of permanently damaging the white enamel and increasing sensitivity if used too often			1
it 's advisable to avoid using anything that might wear your teeth down unnecessarily			1
for this reason , i 'd err on the side of caution and use this once a week , rather than daily			0
the @entity154 may be to counteract potential damage from over-brushing , which can erode the surface of the teeth - but i 've not seen any evidence to prove it does restore enamel			1
this also contains protective fluoride			0
4/10 @entity298 by @entity9 , £ 10.25 from @entity299			0

@entity301 dissolving strips could strip enamel off teeth
@entity197 dentist 's @entity195 has no whitening ingredients in it
it has some *drawbacks* , but @entity313 serum gets the highest rating
