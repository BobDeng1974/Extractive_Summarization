first up a relaxing game of tennis in the morning before being helicoptered - not ferried - back to the superyacht you and your family have chartered to the tune of $ 5 million - a - week			1
then , an exuberant jet ski around the $ 330 million boat with wife @entity13 and children @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , moored off the billionaires playground of @entity19 , @entity20			1
the @entity22 founder and philanthropist - worth $ 76 billion - has taken time away from his busy schedule to relax with his family - renting @entity26 , the 436ft yacht of @entity29 vodka magnate , @entity28 , as a luxurious base			1

walking with his entourage from the courts to his aerial transport , @entity60 was flown back to his yacht , christened @entity68 , where he changed into a wet suit for a jet ski with his entire family			2
boasting not one , but two helicopter landing bads , because , let 's face it one is never enough , the serene can play host to 24 guests in 12 staterooms , which includes a master suite , one vip stateroom , seven double cabins and three twin cabins			2
see more of the serene stroll away : the billionaire walks away from the tennis courts at the billionaires playground of @entity19 , which became a resort when the @entity90 purchased land along the @entity93 coast in the 1960s just bring your racket : @entity60 did n't need to bring much with him for his tennis match seeing as it was only a short hop from his yacht to court - via a helicopter your ride : @entity1 gets ready to get inside his helicopter that will take him back to his rented yacht			2
in the past he has said that he does have guilty pleasure purchases - such as his own private plane can you take me to my yacht ? the richest man in the world would have no problems finding a landing spot on his rented yacht - it has two helipads get comfortable : the billionaire prepares to sit down to be helicoptered back to the 436ft long yacht			1
when asked to reveal a secret about himself which no - one would expect , @entity1 said : ' @entity119 is a pretty old - fashioned thing in a way that i really like			2

' ready to go : @entity1 prepares for take - off to be returned to his $ 5million a week yacht moored of @entity19 in @entity20			1

@entity1 held the title of ' richest man in the world ' for 15 out of the past 20 years , but he was succeeded - briefly - by @entity144 telecommunications magnate @entity142 for the past four years luxury : while most would settle for a boat to take them back to their yacht , @entity1 decided to go large with 52 crew , the serene also boasts a hanger for the helicopter , a seawater swimming pool , submarine hanger , a cinema and onboard @entity157			1
the @entity68 was built in 2011 for the owner of @entity29 , @entity28			0

every august the coastal town off the coast of @entity20 becomes a literal billionaires playground			1
originally owned by the @entity90 , who bought up 50km of coastline almost as a private beach in the 1960s , @entity19 is now undergoing a mini-boom since he sold it to a consortium of bankers in the early part of the 21st century , it is where princess @entity215 spent her final days before her fated trip to @entity218			0
former @entity35 prime minister @entity219 and @entity221 prime minister @entity220 have spent time relaxing in the sun there			2
now dotted with @entity226 and @entity227 stores , the coastline is the perfect spot for the richest man in the world to unwind			1
however , they may be the children of the world 's richest man , but @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 probably should enjoy this vacation while they can - because their father is not leaving them any of his $ 76 billion fortune			1

' you ’ve easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires , ' conference organizer @entity275 said			0

they need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important			0
' ' you ’ve got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they ’re going to go and do , ' he added			0
@entity275 likened raising three children in the world 's richest family ' to a social experiment without much prior art ' before asking the couple , who run the @entity325 , how they had decided to raise their family			1
