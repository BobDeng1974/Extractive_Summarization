by @entity0 published : 00:12 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 11:14 est , 13 april 2012 a large bang heard by hundreds across the country last night was a sonic boom caused by two @entity6 aircraft responding to an emergency , the @entity1 said			1
the @entity9 jets were despatched to a small civilian helicopter that had emitted an emergency signal on a frequency it should not have been using , but the error was realised too late			1
an @entity1 spokesman said the fighter planes , scrambled from @entity17 , in @entity18 , had been authorised to go supersonic and were already on their way to the helicopter			2
confusion : a large bang heard by hundreds across the country last night was a sonic boom caused by two @entity6 aircraft , like this one pictured , responding to an emergency , the @entity1 said drama : a member of the public captured this image as a fighter jet responded to a distress signal sent from a helicopter over @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 unexplained : the two jets , bottom , with the ' mysterious ' silver object that was spotted above @entity36 at the same time he said : ' we can confirm that a small civilian aircraft was transmitting inadvertently on an emergency frequency at approximately 6.10pm			1
' two typhoons from the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) responded accordingly and authorisation was given from them to go supersonic , which resulted in the sonic boom			2
' there was no actual threat to the civilian aircraft and they soon rectified their mistake			1
' the £ 125m jets triggered a string of 999 calls across 150 miles of @entity59 countryside as they caused a huge sonic boom while smashing the sound barrier			1
but the incident turned out to be a false alarm when it emerged the red - faced helicopter pilot , flying near @entity36 , @entity37 , had broadcast the emergency signal by mistake			1
sound alert : the jets broke the speed of sound - causing a large boom to be heard for hundreds of miles across the country - and raced to the aid of the helicopter , flying near @entity36 , @entity37 the bang resulted in a deluge of calls to police forces across the @entity81 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity37 and @entity76 were inundated with calls following the massive boom on thursday			1
buildings and houses were reportedly shaken , stunning residents and baffling emergency services from across the three counties			2
a number of concerned locals witnessed the dramatic scene as one of the @entity6 jets tailed the helicopter			1
@entity95 , from @entity35 , near @entity36 , saw one of the @entity6 jets tailing the helicopter - before snapping the dramatic scene on her camera			1
she said : ' i first heard a massive sonic boom			2
we get @entity103 aircraft flying over here quite a bit - but this was louder than that			0
' i then saw this helicopter , with the jet tailing it			0
it was so low you could see its triangle shape			0
' the @entity6 was swaying behind it from side to side - i have never seen anything like it before			0
' i went inside to grab my camera , then took a quick picture as it was flying off			0
' the jets broke the speed of sound - causing a large boom to be heard for hundreds of miles across the country - and raced to the aid of the helicopter , flying near @entity36 , @entity37			1
concern : the loud bang was heard in @entity128 , @entity36 , @entity129 and @entity130 ( above ) , leading to fears it may have been an explosion or underground tremor but they were called back to their base after it emerged the aircraft had only broadcast the emergency signal in error			1
a sonic boom is the sound associated with the shockwaves created when an object travels through the air and breaks the sound barrier			0
the noise contains large amounts of sound energy , meaning sonic booms are often mistaken for explosions			1
speculation about what could have caused the noise ranged from a large explosion to an underground tremor			1
it is the second time this year that a sonic boom has been created by a @entity6 aircraft			0
in january , the @entity1 confirmed that a loud noise heard by people across the @entity160 was caused by an @entity9 fighter jet breaking the sound barrier			0
warplane : a @entity164 in full weapons configuration @entity166 , bar and restaurant supervisor at @entity169 's in @entity170 , @entity129 , said the noise was so forceful it shook the walls of the restaurant			0
' it sounded like it was coming from the kitchen , ' he said			0
' i thought somebody had dropped one of the big ovens in there			1
' it was a really loud bang and the room shook and all the wine glasses on the rack shook			2
' when it was n't coming from the kitchen i thought maybe it was the cellar , but then wondered if it could be something else			2
' it was weird , but did n't last long			0
' @entity190 , a supervisor at the @entity192 shop in @entity193 , said she did not experience anything , but her boyfriend , @entity195 , rang her and told her the walls of his house were shaking			0
' he said there were two very loud bangs and he felt the room was shaking , ' she said			0
' he lives up in @entity202 and is off work sick at the moment so was n't sure what it was - he thought he might be hallucinating			2
' he was actually quite freaked out by it and i had to tell him he was n't going mad and lots of people were talking about it			0
' the jets were scrambled because the frequency the helicopter pilot mistakenly transmitted on is only used when an aircraft is in particular trouble			2
such a signal could indicate the aircraft had been hijacked or had ' gone rogue ' .			0
