by @entity0 the @entity1 were investigating how to use mosquitos as biological weapons , recently discovered documents reveal			0
ss - chief @entity6 ’s entomological institute at @entity7 investigated whether malaria - infected mosquitos could survive transport into enemy territory			1
the institute , set up by @entity6 in 1942 , conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to ‘ transport ’ malaria from the lab to @entity18 troops			1
@entity21 's bio war : ss - chief @entity6 's entomological institute at @entity7 conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to spread malaria to @entity18 troops the institute ’s official mission was to conduct research into insect - transmitted diseases , such as typhoid , but according to a recent article , it also investigated potential ways of conducting biological warfare in 1944 , the director of the institute recommended a particular type of anopheles mosquito known for its capacity to transmit malaria to humans , according to an article in science journal @entity40			1
due to @entity21 having signed up to the 1925 @entity42 protocol , use of biological weapons was forbidden and as a result , the ‘ mosquito malaria project ’ had to remain secret			2
the project was ‘ a bizarre mix of @entity6 's smattering of scientific knowledge , personal paranoia , an esoteric world view , and genuine concerns about his ss troops ’ , the article ’s author @entity47 told @entity57			2
the idea of attacking @entity21 enemies with malaria was not the only unconventional idea investigated by @entity6			2
evil plans : the ' mosquito project ' was carried out in secret , by scientists at @entity6 's @entity7 concentration camp , and proof of the experiments has only emerged in modern times as @entity70 , pictured with @entity6 , had signed the 1925 @entity42 protocol the ' mosquito malaria project ' had to be conducted in secret at @entity7 according to a 2010 book , @entity6 believed he would be able to manufacture gold			1
an alchemist named @entity77 convinced @entity6 that he could make gold from stones , soil and even paraffin			0
he was installed at another secret unit at @entity7 , and it allegedly took several weeks before @entity6 realised he had been conned			0
' @entity84 ' was another one of the @entity56 chief 's plans , one which involved breeding giant @entity88 rabbits in concentration camps to provide fur - lined clothing for @entity70 's armed forces			0
while prisoners were starved , beaten and tortured to death in @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity7 , thousands of rabbits were kept in hutches in these and 27 other camps			0
the rabbits were treated eons better than the prisoners of the camps , and according to @entity6 's notes the population grew from 6,500 in 1941 to 25,000 in 1943			0
however , as the @entity18 began to move in on @entity21 , @entity6 's ' pet project ' was stopped .			1
