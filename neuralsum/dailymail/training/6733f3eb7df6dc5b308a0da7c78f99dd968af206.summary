@entity0 and @entity2 forward @entity1 could make his return from injury in time for sunday 's crucial clash with @entity6 at @entity7			1
manager @entity8 revealed the 25 - year - old , who has made just two appearances this season as a substitute before another spell on the sidelines , is back in training after a groin problem he suffered while on international duty with @entity2			1
while @entity8 will take no chances on @entity1 's rehabilitation , the imminent availability of the jet - heeled forward will come as a welcome boost ahead of the hectic @entity24 schedule , which could also see both defender @entity25 and midfielder @entity26 shake off their fitness problems			1
we hope that @entity26 will be fit			2
we will see that on saturday , ' @entity8 told @entity46			2
' he ( @entity1 ) is back in training today ( thursday ) , but only today			2
i might take him ( to @entity6 ) , i do n't know yet until he is back to full training			1
' @entity26 limped out of the closing stages of @entity0 's 4 - 1 @entity53 win over @entity54 last weekend with a groin problem which the club hope will prove to be minor			1
training has being intensified for @entity1 as he nears full fitness ahead of the crucial @entity6 match on one of @entity1 's rare outings this season - an under - 21 encounter against @entity64 ' that 's what we 'll see on saturday after a test			1
he is not in training at the moment , ' @entity8 added			2
@entity0 playmaker @entity71 is another who is stepping up his rehabilitation , having been out since the defeat at @entity75 on october 5 because of a knee problem			0
@entity8 also confirmed both goalkeeper @entity77 and midfielder @entity78 are also close to being available again following their respective thigh problems			2
however , captain @entity81 ( calf ) , midfielder @entity83 ( hamstring ) and centre - back @entity85 ( calf ) are still out , but ' progressing as planned ' , according to the @entity89 boss			0
@entity0 will be looking to remain within striking distance of the top four with a positive result at @entity7 to continue their upturn in form , which has seen five wins from six across all competitions			0
the knock - out stages of the @entity98 await @entity0 , who have been paired with @entity100 , the @entity102 club where @entity8 made his name as a young coach			1
@entity8 won the @entity106 title in 1988 and the @entity107 in 1991 , as well as reaching the @entity109 final and then the semi-finals of the @entity98 in 1994 , and went on to have a spell managing in @entity112 before being a surprise choice for the @entity0 job in october 1996			1
he has never since faced @entity100 in a competitive fixture , and is looking forward to his return to the @entity118 stadium for the second leg of the tie in march next year			0
' we had very few chances to get @entity100 and i think it 's a strange coincidence in life because i have spent 25 years of my life at @entity100 and @entity0 together , so it 's a little bit like my life meets my life , ' @entity8 added			1
' it is good as well because i go back to basically where i started			0
' i have never [ been back ] , because i was always very busy and since i have been here in @entity2 we have played every three days basically throughout the whole season			0
i have been back to the city a few times but never to the stadium			0
' @entity100 were considered one of the weaker seeds , having come through @entity138 ahead of @entity139 but scored just four goals - two of those coming in the final tie with @entity142			0
' overall , it is an opportunity for us to get through to the quarter - final , ' said @entity8 , whose side were knocked out of @entity148 by @entity149 in the past two seasons			1
' having said that , @entity100 is a tough draw because they have come top out of a very tough group and that means it is a signal for us to be ready to meet a tough team who defend very well and are very quick on counter-attacks			0
we need a good defensive performance against them			0

the 25 - year - old has made just two appearances this season
@entity8 confirmed @entity1 has resumed full training
@entity25 and @entity26 could also face @entity6
@entity6 take on @entity0 *buoyed* by their @entity170 quarter - final win
