by @entity0 last updated at 11:04 am on 1st december 2011 police had to ferry sick patients to hospital last night as over-stretched @entity5 services struggled to cope with yesterdays strike			1
desperate ambulance chiefs made a plea to the @entity10 police yesterday evening as they were hit with a deluge of emergency calls			1
staff were supposed to provide ' emergency cover ' , which is the level that unions and the @entity16 have agreed staff working in frontline roles can provide while still supporting industrial action			1
but this morning , mr @entity20 said : ' it is disappointing that , despite asking staff to return to work as normal or volunteer for emergency cover during the afternoon when we had significant numbers of patients waiting for ambulances and had declared an internal major incident , few did so			1
' unite members man the picket line outside the @entity33			2
thousands of operations have been postponed across the country because of the action @entity16 workers and @entity39 members try to keep warm around a brazier on a picket line in @entity42 , @entity43 he added : ' we will carry out a detailed review of the events of yesterday , and we have already started discussions with the unions about this			1
' the astonishing scenes were played out as the @entity16 revealed it was under ' increased pressure ' , with 30 per cent more 999 calls today than normal , according to @entity43			2
some 42 per cent of its staff are on strike			1
commander @entity57 in charge of the today 's policing operation for the public services demonstration said : ' it is normal for the emergency services to work together on large scale events and incidents and the @entity65 will provide whatever support is necessary to the @entity16			1
' whilst these are exceptional circumstances , we will work with colleagues from the other blue light services to provide whatever support and assistance we can to help			1
all police officers are first aid trained			1
yesterday the deputy director of operations , @entity20 , urged patient 's only to call them in an absolute emergency , adding : ' we are still under severe pressure and expect this to increase over the next few hours as a result of today 's industrial action			1
' there are still a number of patients who are waiting for an ambulance response and it is more important than ever for @entity88 to only dial 999 for an ambulance if somebody 's life is in danger			1
' we have asked unions to encourage their members to return to work as normal or increase their emergency cover , as per the agreement with @entity98 and @entity99			0
' however , the picture varies across the @entity101 , with some trusts facing major disruption while others are working as close to normal as possible			0
theatre nurse @entity105 with a placard on a picket line outside the main entrance of @entity109 in @entity43 today , the @entity5 is more or less operating as if it was a weekend or @entity110			1
emergency and trauma care will be the priority			0
@entity5 trusts across the country have written to patients informing them not to come in , although they are still providing emergency and critical care			1

the 24 - hour walkout by two million public sector workers was called in response to the bitter row over pensions			0
unions are furious over plans to reform pensions which will involve members working longer and having to pay more			0
as the strike got underway today health secretary @entity145 told @entity147 that @entity5 staff would still have the ' best pension scheme available ' after the changes and negotiations were ongoing			1
' unfortunately this ( the strike ) is happening at the point of course when we tend to go into winter pressures and the consequences of @entity159 and @entity160 , ' he said			1
' it makes it harder			0
it will inconvenience patients , i 'm disappointed about that			2
' mr @entity145 added : ' i asked staff to consider patients ' interest first			1
i hope that many staff who have been balloted to go on strike will choose not to go on strike			1
' mr @entity145 said patients who had an appointment today should get it rescheduled so they are still treated within 18 weeks			2
' our objective will continue to be to ensure that patients have their @entity180 right to treatment within 18 weeks of referral by their gp , and that diagnostic tests , they get that within six weeks , ' he said			2
' we will continue to do that			0
