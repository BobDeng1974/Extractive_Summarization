it is one of @entity3 's greatest architectural masterpieces and these stunning photos give a rare glimpse inside the 150 - year - old @entity6			1
the iconic bridge , stretched 245 feet above the @entity8 to link @entity9 with @entity10 , reached its landmark birthday this month			2
and to celebrate , photographer @entity12 was granted rare access to the magnificent structure that @entity15 referred to as ' my first child , my darling '			1
the slight movement of the chains absorbs forces created by chain deflection prevents and damage to both tower and chain as heavy loads pass over the bridge @entity12 captured images from inside the 110ft - high @entity21 tower and the stunning views across @entity9 and the surrounding countryside			1
in 2002 it was discovered that the abutment on which the tower stands was not a solid structure but contained 12 vaulted chambers up to 35 feet high , linked by shafts and tunnels			1
roller - mounted ' saddles ' at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge			1
though their total travel is minuscule , their ability to absorb forces created by chain deflection prevents damage to both tower and chain			2
the view from the very top of the @entity21 shows the spectacular scenery around the bridge which @entity15 described as ' my first child , my darling ' @entity12 was given the rare access to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the bridge , which was marked with a fireworks display on december 8 @entity28 , @entity29 of @entity15 's @entity6 , looks out across the bridge from the top of the @entity21 the view from the south side of @entity15 's @entity6 from the @entity21 gives a new perspective of the iconic bridge the bridge , which spans the @entity87 , opened to the public on december 8 , 1864 and is regarded as @entity15 ’s finest achievement			1
plans for a bridge go back as far as 1754 when @entity9 wine merchant @entity92 left £ 1,000 in his will to the @entity95 , requesting £ 10,000 was raised to build a bridge to the city			2
however , war with @entity99 stalled the idea of a grand bridge , built tall enough so that ships could pass underneath , and it was not until the 1820s that it was resuscitated			0
completed in 1864 , the majestic @entity6 is a testament to the ingenuity of @entity108 engineering			0
it was designed by @entity15 who was only 24 years old when he won the commission to build the incredible structure			1
the majority of the weight of the bridge is supported by its two major towers ; @entity118 tower and the @entity6 tower			1
as compression pushes down on @entity6 ’s deck , the chains transfer that compression to the towers			0
the towers then dissipate the compression directly into the ground			0
the bridge has three independent wrought iron chains on each side , from which the bridge deck is suspended by 81 matching vertical iron rods ranging from 65ft ( 20 metres ) at the ends to 3ft ( 0.91 metres ) in the centre			0
roller - mounted ‘ saddles ’ at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge , to help absorb forces and prevent damage to the structure			1
the supporting cables deal with the bridge 's tension forces			1
these cables run horizontally between the bridges anchorages , which pass the tension forces to the rock below			0
timber sleepers overlaid with planking make up the deck of the bridge , which has been covered with asphalt since 1897			0
the bridge is made up of 3,500 load bearing bolts and huge chains that stretch 20 miles ( 32km ) underground			0
of the 4,200 links in the iron chains which hold the 1,500 - ton structure together , 4,199 are @entity108 originals			0
overall , it spans 700ft ( 210 metres ) and sits 245ft ( 75 metres ) above the water below at high tide			0
by 1829 , £ 8,000 had been secured and a competition was announced for engineers to submit their designs for a bridge across the gorge			0
the competition was to be judged by @entity172 designer @entity171 , but he rejected all entries - including @entity15 's - and submitted his own plans			1
however , locals were not impressed by @entity177 plans and the whole project stalled			0
a year later a new competition was held and @entity15 , who was just 24 at the time , was declared the winner and appointed project engineer for a fee of 2,000 guineas			2
work was painfully slow and expensive and became surplus to requirement when another bridge was opened so the project was abandoned in 1853			0
the spectacular photos , taken from the top of the tower , gove a new perspective on the iconic grade 1 - listed bridge the 85 - foot - tall @entity21 tower stands atop a 110 - foot red sandstone - clad abutment and gives a view over the whole bridge but @entity15 's death in 1859 , aged just 53 , prompted the @entity201 to restart the project to commemorate their hero			1
they purchased chain links form the @entity207 in @entity208 , another @entity15 project which was being dismantled , and used them to complete the @entity211			2
the link , purchased for £ 5,000 , were even transported to @entity9 on @entity15 's @entity213			1
by november 1864 , the bridge was ready and workmen tested t by dumping 500 tons of rock on the central section to see if it would hold			2
the rare images celebrate what is one of @entity3 's most iconic architectural masterpieces , and 34 years in the making @entity225 , @entity15 's great great grandson visits the @entity6 in @entity9 as the structure marks its 150th anniversary @entity15 first won the competition to build the @entity6 in @entity9 in 1830 , but it was not completed until 34 years later after being abandoned in 1853 , the bridge project was restarted following @entity15 's death and completed in 1864 archive photo of the building of the @entity6 in @entity9 in the 1860s shows the iconic bridge near completion the bridge dipped seven inches under the weight , but returned to its former state once they were removed , declaring the engineering feat a success			1
a century and a half later , the bridge still draws half a million visitors a year to marvel at the engineering wonder			0
and the @entity247 i listed structure is used daily with more than 8,000 motorists crossing the bridge every day			0
thousands of people once again flocked to the bridge earlier this month to watch a dazzling fireworks display to celebrate its 150th anniversary on december 8 .			2

photographer @entity12 was give access to bridge 's 110ft - high @entity21 tower
pictures shows views from top of bridge as well as inner workings of *suspension* bridge cables
@entity15 's masterpiece is celebrating 150 years since its completion in december 1864
