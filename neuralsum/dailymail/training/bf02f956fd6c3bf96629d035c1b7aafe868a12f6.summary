ministers are working on plans to commemorate the anniversary of the @entity4 truce during the @entity5 with a football match on the battlefields of @entity8			1
@entity4 will mark the centenary of when the guns fell silent and @entity12 and @entity13 troops emerged from the trenches in @entity15 and played football in @entity17			1
the government is talking to the @entity19 and the @entity20 about how the 1914 matches can be remembered			1
when @entity5 began in july 1914 , many troops were excited to be sent to the front line			1
people were optimistic that the war would be over promptly and they would be back by @entity4			2
but within a few months the death toll had reached one million before a single trench had even been dug			2
the fighting soon ground to a stalemate and the reality of war sunk in			2
@entity45 from the @entity46 wrote : ' ... the real horror of it came home to us , and if everyone else was as frightened as i was , then we were all petrified			2
' the fighting lasted for four years , with 16 million troops and civilians losing their lives - one million of them @entity12			2
prime minister @entity57 raised the possibility last year of football matches forming part of an extended series of events to mark the centenaries of key moments during the @entity5			1
speaking to @entity65 , dr @entity27 indicated that it was an idea was being pursued although planning was still at an early stage and ' discussions are ongoing '			0
he said : ' i think football has a particular part to play because of the totemic significance of the @entity4 truce in 1914			0
' we have been in touch with @entity19 and the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) to see how this can be done			1
' i know they are enthused and have already clocked the fact that other countries are thinking along similar lines			0
' he added : ' it is clear the @entity4 truce is going to be commemorated in a very significant way			0
it had no real relevance to the outcome of the war but at that deeply , intensely , personal level , it is something that people really do latch on to			0
' remembered : troops at @entity95 in @entity96 marked a previous anniversary of the @entity99 truce by playing a football match against @entity13 soldiers the @entity4 truce of 1914 was a spontaneous and unofficial laying down of arms across various sectors of the entrenched @entity106			1
in some areas , soldiers on both sides merely held their fire throughout the day			0
but in some sectors , troops climbed out of their trenches and made contact with their enemies , some reportedly exchanging gifts and handshakes and playing football			0
more practically , soldiers used the time to reclaim their dead from @entity17 and bury them behind the lines			1
in the evening , soldiers of both sides sang carols and hostilities were only resumed when fresh battalions were moved into the line , breaking the bonds between the enemies which formed during that day			0
the @entity99 truce of 1914 was never repeated during the rest of @entity5			0
