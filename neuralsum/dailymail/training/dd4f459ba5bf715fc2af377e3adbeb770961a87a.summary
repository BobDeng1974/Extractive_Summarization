as any chocoholic will attest , whether it 's in a bar or melted into fondue , a hit of the sweet brown stuff can be difficult to resist			0
and now chocolate lovers can take their addiction to a whole new level thanks to the chocolate shooter - a device that allows people to snort cocoa powder			1
based on old @entity14 snuff shooters , the device was invented by @entity17 chocolatier @entity15 as a novel way to enjoy his favourite sweet treat			1
a push of the lever then fires the chocolate up either nostril he originally made the device for a @entity26 party in 2007 , but the concept has taken off and been used by culinary innovators such as @entity47 at his restaurant @entity49			1
diners are given a special mix of @entity52 or @entity54 cocoa powder mixed with raspberry , ginger and mint to snort			2
they pack the powder into two small spoons fixed to a trigger mechanism , then hold the device close to their nose and press the lever , sending it shooting up their nostrils			1
the tattoo - clad 46 - year - old said : ' the mint and the ginger really tinkle your nose			1
then the mint flavour goes down and the chocolate stays in your brain			0
' it has taken him years to develop the perfect snorting powder , as early experiments with pure cocoa powder revealed it was too dry			0
perfection : before landing on his current mix , mr @entity15 was using a combination involving chili pepper , which he says was ' a very bad idea ' in hindsight sexy : mr @entity15 says there is a ' kinky ' appeal to snorting the chocolate , but denies that he is promoting drug use , saying the device is just a bit of fun novelty : the chocolate shooter sells for around 45 euros ( £ 30 ) and has been used by the likes of @entity47 at his restaurant @entity49 before he hit on the tingling sensation of mint and ginger , he was using a mix which contained chili			1
' it 's a very bad idea , ' he said			0
the chocolate shooters , which sell for 45 euros ( £ 30 ) each , have been exported to @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109			0
the packaging bears a warning against excessive sniffing , but @entity15 insists it is safe			2
he was inspired by the role of the nose when tasting food and , he says , a certain idea of fun			0
he added : ' the mentality when you think about sniffing is : " oh it 's kinky , guys who do that stuff ... ' " ' i 'm not the bad boy promoting drugs , not at all ... life is boring			0
' straight to the brain : mr @entity15 says the ginger and mint open the nasal passages and make the face tingle , while helping deliver a pure hit of cocoa			2
