by @entity0 last updated at 3:18 am on 2nd march 2012 a senior @entity2 mp has claimed expenses from the taxpayer for attending @entity6 services in his constituency			1
@entity8 , who earns more than £ 80,000 , claimed £ 13 to attend three separate services in his @entity11 constituency in november last year			1
mr @entity8 , chairman of the powerful commons business , innovation and skills committee , also claimed £ 3.15 to attend the launch of a local poppy appeal in @entity15 the previous month			1
in the wrong ? @entity8 's ( pictured in dark shades ) claims on expenses for attending a remembrance service at @entity20 is in poor taste the claims are permitted under @entity24 ’s supposedly tough new expenses rules and were approved by the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			2
but mr @entity8 ’s decision to claim mileage expenses for attending events that many consider a civic duty is likely to raise eyebrows			2
figures published yesterday reveal that he claimed £ 2.70 in mileage for a six - mile round trip to attend the remembrance service at @entity11 town hall			1
he then claimed £ 4.95 for an 11 - mile round trip to the service at @entity39			1
finally , he claimed a further £ 5.40 for a 12 - mile round trip to a service at @entity43 cemetery			2
mr @entity8 is a senior figure on @entity2 ’s backbenches and is paid £ 14,500 on top of his mps ’ salary in recognition of his role as a select committee chairman			1
excessive ? @entity52 claimed over £ 155 for a taxi fare into @entity54 last year despite his generous salary , the new figures suggest he is scrupulous about claiming his expenses , however small			2
on two occasions in november he claimed £ 2.25 for ‘ tea and cake ’ , while on another he charged the taxpayer £ 3.35 for ‘ cake , apple , coffee and two plums ’			1
mr @entity8 was invited to comment last night but did not respond			0
the figures were included in the latest batch of expenses data from @entity25			0
in the two months of october and november last year @entity69 processed £ 3.5 million in expenses claims from @entity47			0
notable claims include a £ 155.65 taxi fare submitted by the shadow chancellor @entity52 when he returned to @entity54 for the recall of @entity24 following the riots in august last year			0
aides last night mr @entity52 was forced to get a taxi from @entity77 to his north @entity54 home after catching a late flight home from a foreign holiday			0
transport secretary @entity82 submitted two 10p claims for bus fares , although an aide stressed that the claims related to travel expenses for an intern working in her office			0
the aide pointed that @entity91 did not claim for her own travel around her constituency in @entity94 , @entity54			0
in total , mps claimed for more than £ 92,000 in mileage during the two - month period			0
critics argue that the ability of mps to claim 40p a mile in mileage cushions them from the pain caused to ordinary motorists by soaring fuel prices			0
