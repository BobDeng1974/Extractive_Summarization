but now she leads her jungle body class with aplomb , despite being a size 20 with a @entity33 of 41.4 - making her technically obese			2
bubbly @entity21 reckons being big like her clients makes them feel more comfortable during classes and therefore they 'll shed more weight in her once a week class			1

i want people to realise that you can still be overweight and healthy at the same time			1
' for a big girl , going to the gym is a nightmare			2
you 're surrounded by slim girls in @entity2 - it can be very demoralising			2
' when i started getting fit i would stand at the back of the class so no one could see my booty and i refused to lift my arms high so no one would see my bingo wings			2
@entity21 's clients look like they are having fun whilst taking the class with her @entity21 decided to lose weight herself after being told by her doctor that she was incredibly unhealthy @entity21 had piled on the pounds after gorging on jars of peanut butter and huge family sized meals ' some of the moves i simply had to avoid altogether because my fat would get in the way			1

that was a real wake - up call			0
' @entity21 had ballooned to a massive size 26 by gorging herself on jars of peanut butter and massive portions - often enough to feed an entire family			0

@entity21 looks energetic as she takes her class in @entity7 , she says she wants people to realise you can be fat and healthy at the same time @entity21 leads the class as they do their stretches during her class she said : ' i ate whatever i felt like , that was the problem			1
peanut butter on toast with bananas on top was my weakness - and i would skip breakfast , which was naughty			0
' i was n't a complete pig all day but i would be eat a big dinner and keep snacking throughout the night			0
' portion control for sure was a problem - the size of my dinners just spiraled out of control			0
' single @entity21 managed to shed four and a half stone using a balance of healthy eating and gym exercise and launched her @entity121 classes in october last year			1
she teaches @entity124 , dance fitness classes that claims to burn up to 700 calories in an hour			1
@entity21 sweats it out with her clients during the work out class - she said that going to the gym as a big girl is a nightmare @entity21 says the class is really fun because her clients get to dance around and feel like they are @entity134 @entity21 , who works in accounts , said : ' it 's a lot of fun			1
