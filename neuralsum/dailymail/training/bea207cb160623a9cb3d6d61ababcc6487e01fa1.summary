by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 02:23 est , 24 april 2013 @entity1 has unveiled a breathtaking image that shows a year in the life of the sun - and a video that condenses three years of activity on the solar surface into three minutes			1
it reveals solar flares and coronal mass ejections caught in the act in unprecedented detail			0
the images from @entity1 's @entity14 also reveal space weather that can send radiation and solar material toward @entity18 and interfere with satellites in space			1
the image above and video below video shows those three years of the sun at a pace of two images per day			2
each image is displayed for two frames at a 29.97 frame rate			0
the @entity14 ’s @entity48 ( @entity49 ) captures a shot of the sun every 12 seconds in 10 different wavelengths			0
the images shown here are based on a wavelength of 171 angstroms , which is in the extreme ultraviolet range and shows solar material at around 600,000 @entity58			1
in this wavelength it is easy to see the sun ’s 25 - day rotation as well as how solar activity has increased over three years			0
june 2 , 2010 to april 15 , 2013 at a cadence of two frames per day , or one frame every 12 hours			0
the images were captured at 171 @entity69 light , which highlights material around 600,000 @entity58 and shows features in the upper transition region and quiet corona of the sun. the still image shows a partial eclipse of the sun by the moon from @entity14 's perspective			1
during the course of the video , the sun subtly increases and decreases in apparent size			0
this is because the distance between the @entity14 spacecraft and the sun varies over time			0
the image is , however , remarkably consistent and stable despite the fact that @entity14 orbits the @entity18 at 6,876 miles per hour and the @entity18 orbits the sun at 67,062 miles per hour			1
' such stability is crucial for scientists , who use @entity14 to learn more about our closest star , ' says @entity1 , which operates the craft			2
' these images have regularly caught solar flares and coronal mass ejections in the act , types of space weather that can send radiation and solar material toward @entity18 and interfere with satellites in space			1
' researchers hope the images will improve our ability to predict this space weather .			2

@entity1 *timelapse* shows images from its @entity14 since it was *launched* in 2010
image and video show the violent space weather that can send radiation and solar material toward @entity18 and interfere with satellites in space
