@entity0 has bowed to pressure , saying he intends to permit the continued sale of individual insurance plans that have been canceled because they failed to meet coverage standards under the @entity6 president @entity0 has changed course in mid-disaster , announcing a new policy allowing health insurance companies to keep selling the policies they have canceled by the millions as a consequence of the @entity6			1
' insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise been canceled , into 2014 , ' he said			2
the president of the health insurance industry 's largest trade group , however , warned after @entity0 's speech that his plan ' could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers			1
' ' premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace , " according to @entity27 , the president of @entity28			2
' if now fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange , premiums will increase and there will be fewer choices for consumers			2
' in his rare appearance in the @entity38 briefing room , @entity0 also said he did n't know how bad the healthcare.gov website 's rollout would be			1
the president stopped short of promising that all @entity42 would find it functioning normally by the @entity44 ' self - imposed nov. 30 deadline			1
and he conceded for the first time that the policy cancellations are ' often ' coming ' because they no longer meet the law 's requirements			2
' americans receiving those letters , he acknowledged , are ' understandably aggravated about it			0
' ' that ’s something that i deeply regret , ' he added later , ' because it ’s scary getting a cancellation notice			0
' the announcement drew jeers from @entity60 lawmakers and unusually aggressive followup questions from reporters			0
' but it does represent the clearest acknowledgment yet that his oft - repeated pledge " if you like your plan , you can keep it " was false all along			0
' ' the only " fix " is full repeal followed by step - by - step , patient - centered reforms , ' @entity81 said			0
@entity87 @entity86 sen. @entity86 declared in a statement that @entity42 have had ' enough with temporary fixes and deadline extensions			2
' ' we should dismantle this law , so @entity42 can choose the insurance plan that works for them , not president @entity0 , ' @entity86 said			1
@entity0 made the announcement during a hastily called late - morning press conference			2
the fix he offered will be temporary – in effect only for 2014 – unless another course correction is offered later			0
' i completely get how upsetting this can be for @entity42 , ' he said in response to the wave of cancellations , ' particularly after the assurances they got from me ... i hear you loud and clear			1
' @entity38 minority leader @entity107 let the cat out of the bag thursday , saying that @entity0 would offer an administrative fix and allow @entity42 to renew their canceled insurance plans unlike a @entity60 plan scheduled for a vote friday , @entity0 's version closes the previously canceled policies to individuals who were not already enrolled in them			1
@entity60 want a retroactive fix applied to all policies that consumers hold as of dec. 31 of this year			2
they also are demanding that consumers should be able to join existing plans held by family members			2
his new approach ' wo n't solve every problem for every person , ' @entity0 said , ' but it 's going to help a lot of people			1
' the president ’s proposal would also require insurers to tell consumers how their policies fall short of compliance with the @entity6 's minimum standards			1
@entity0 's remarks were scheduled for 11:35 a.m. but started after noon			0
@entity137 was awash with jokes about the delay			0
' if you like your 11:35am speech , you can keep it , ' quipped one commentator			0
' maybe @entity0 is late because he 's waiting for the site to load first , ' snarked another			0
@entity6 's early implementation ' has been wrought with a whole range of problems , ' the president admitted when he finally made it to the podium			1
' we fumbled the rollout on this health care law , ' he said			1
but he insisted that the butt - of - jokes website has ' gotten a lot better over the last few weeks ' despite problems with ' information technology procurement ' that are inherent in the federal government			0
@entity0 said the flawed website rollout was n't his fault since aides did n't tell him it was doomed to fail asked whether all @entity42 would be able to access and use healthcare.gov by nov. 30 , @entity0 would only promise that ' the majority of people who go to the website will see a website that 's working the way it 's supposed to			1
' ' it 's not possible for me to guarantee , ' he cautioned , ' that 100 per cent of the people 100 per cent of the time going to this website will have a seamless , smooth experience			1
' and he told reporters that he did n't know ahead of time how bad the launch would be			2
' i was not informed directly that the website was n't working the way it was supposed to , ' he said			2
if his aides had warned him , @entity0 added , he would n't have been promising a smooth introduction			1
' i do n't think i 'm stupid enough to say this is going to be as easy as shopping around on @entity180 or @entity181 , ' he said			0
but he did n't say whether the rollout would have been delayed			0
the administration released figures wednesday showing that just 26,794 people nationwide enrolled in a private health plan through the online federal marketplace between oct. 1 and nov. 2			2
@entity189 79,391 people bought plans through state - run exchange websites			0
and the president has come under increased pressure to fix what @entity60 have called a disastrous outcome of the @entity6 system – a raft of new wide - ranging minimum medical insurance requirements that most individual policies do n't meet			1
the healthcare.gov website has been a universally acknowledged catastrophe for the @entity0 administration , including crashes , leaks of personal information and gibberish - spouting login pages sen. @entity207 ( @entity208 ) had offered her own legislative fix , but @entity0 is moving forward with his own band - aid approach that does n't require @entity212 to act with insurers killing off those plans , an estimated 5 million @entity42 have already received cancellation notices , putting the lie to @entity0 's frequent promise that ' if you like your plan , you can keep your plan			1
' @entity221 reported thursday that @entity38 aides including chief of staff @entity223 , will brief @entity38 @entity224 on the plan thursday after the president speaks			0
@entity224 politicians , particularly senators who face tough re-election fights in 2014 , have been running for the exits in recent weeks , seeking cover as the @entity6 system implodes and former president @entity232 made waves inside the @entity224 this week by insisting that @entity0 should keep his pledge			1
@entity232 's move was both a political hand grenade and a maneuver for 2016 , when his wife @entity238 , the former secretary of state , is eyeing a presidential run of her own			0
putting distance between her and @entity6 will help her chances of dodging association with the flailing program , especially since she proposed a similar policy – the widely mocked ' @entity246 ' – during her husband 's 1990s presidency			2
both democrats and @entity60 have proposed legislative fixes to force changes in @entity6 that would let @entity42 keep their insurance plans , regardless of the law 's new minimum - standards requirements			1
by acting on thursday , the @entity38 hopes to avoid a slew of @entity224 defections to a @entity60 @entity38 plan scheduled for a vote friday			0
but he also said he was open to working with @entity212 on additional fixes			1
the @entity0 administration was also reacting to a statement from @entity38 minority leader @entity107 , who said thursday morning that walking back the insurance cancellations ' can be done administratively			1
the president will offer a proposal today , is my understanding			0
' rep. @entity268 is the face of the most aggressive @entity6 fix offered to date , short of a complete repeal the @entity38 has quietly talked up instead a proposal from @entity224 sen. @entity207 of @entity274 , but @entity38 @entity60 favor the much tougher measure from @entity277 rep. @entity268			1
both plans would keep millions of @entity42 in private insurance plans , pulling them out of the federal health care exchanges			1
@entity268 's bill would allow insurers to keep offering the cancelled policies			0
@entity207 's would force them to do so			0
republicans in the @entity38 are resisting the @entity207 approach			0
requiring insurers to sell specific plans , they say , would represent the same kind of government intervention in private commerce as the @entity6 system brought to the table in the first place			1
but the president 's planned announcement may make both of them moot , since he can enforce an administrative fix without going through @entity212			1
during a closed - door caucus meeting on thursday , some @entity38 @entity224 insisted that they will vote for the @entity268 rep. @entity232 in order to save their own skin in the 2014 midterm elections			0
former @entity42 president @entity232 started the fire last week by saying @entity0 should keep his promises according to @entity221 , @entity307 rep. @entity306 said , ' i am beginning to think members of the administration have n't read the [ @entity6 ] bill			1
i am voting for @entity268 tomorrow			0
' @entity313 rep. @entity312 said he had told the @entity38 told the @entity38 that ' members of @entity212 are n’t judged by administrative fixes ; they ’re judged by their voting records			2
' ' and people want to be on the record that we made a commitment to the @entity42 people that they could keep their insurance if they like it , and we want to fix that			1
' @entity44 secretary @entity324 told a @entity75 committee last week that retroactively letting insurers sell canceled policies might not be effective			0
' companies are now in the market with an array of new plans , ' she warned			0
' many have actually added consumer protections in the last three - and - a - half years			0

@entity0 will allow insurers to keep offering plans that they *'ve* already been canceling by the millions
' i completely get how upsetting this can be for @entity42 , ' he said , ' particularly after the assurances they got from me '
the insurance industry warns that the move ' could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers '
' i 'm not a perfect man , ' he said , but claimed that he did n't know in advance how disastrous the healthcare.gov launch would be
' we fumbled the rollout on this health care law , ' @entity0 admitted
the president acknowledged for the first time that millions of insurance cancellations have come because of the @entity6 law
@entity212 has proposed its own fixes , but @entity0 has chosen an administrative fix that he says wo n't require legislation
he stopped short of promising that ' 100 per cent of the people 100 per cent of the time ' would find the @entity6 website working by nov. 30
