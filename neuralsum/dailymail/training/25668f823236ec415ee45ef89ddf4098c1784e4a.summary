@entity1 's requirement of ' microstamping ' technology means that no guns manufactured after 2013 have been sold in the state , known as having some of the strictest gun control laws			1
now gun - rights groups are hoping that a federal judge will overturn the provision that gun manufacturers have blamed for ceasing gun sales			2
@entity12 reports that the @entity13 and @entity14 are eagerly awaiting a decision on microstamping requirements they say are effectively banning firearm sales			0
stamped : @entity19 uses laser - engraved codes on firing pins to trace a shell casing to the gun that fired the bullet , though studies are inconclusive on its effectiveness the request for @entity1 eastern district judge @entity28 to stop the state from enforcing a law on microstamping is the latest in a legal battle that began in 2009 over the state 's ' @entity33			1
' ' this is about the state trying to eliminate the handgun market , ' said @entity38 , the lead attorney in the lawsuit against the chief of the @entity41 of firearms			0
' the evidence submitted by the manufacturers shows this is science fiction and there is not a practical way to implement the law			2
' microstamping utilizes lasers to engrave an alphanumeric code on the parts of the weapon such as the firing pin , which is transferred to a shell casing when the gun is fired			1
a 2008 study from the forensic science program at @entity58 found that the codes on the face of the firing pin often transferred legibly , though codes on the edges wore down with repeated use			0
@entity65 , then - director of the forensic science graduate program at @entity58 , said at the time that the technology would cost between $ 6 and $ 7 to implement , but that more research was needed			2
patented technology : @entity70 , who patented microstamping technology , has agreed to let his patents expire , a prerequisite for the technology being mandated by @entity1 's gun laws @entity1 's requirement that handguns carry the technology , which was patented in the 1990s , stipulated that the technology be feasible and all private patents are expired , @entity76 reported			1
@entity83 city attorney @entity82 , who introduced the bill that enacted the microstamping requirement as a state assemblyman , said the technology could identify the firearm in 45 percent of unsolved gun crimes			2
' when we know who bought the crime gun , that â€™s a significant lead for law enforcement , ' @entity82 said			0
firearms manufacturers have not been warm to the new technology , which proponents say could replace or complement ballistic fingerprinting , a century - old method of identifying a firearm used in a shooting			0
two gun manufacturers , @entity102 and @entity103 , blamed the microstamping requirement when they announced last year they would stop selling guns in @entity1			1
@entity102 , though , is still selling certain models , such as the @entity108 pistol , grandfathered in on the state 's @entity33 of legal firearms			0
in the view of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit , such as @entity115 , co-founder of @entity13 , with gunmakers backing out of the state , the law is a de facto ban on firearm sales			1
' any new semi-automatic gun that we want to carry for self defense or purchase as collectors will not be available to us at all , ' @entity115 said .			0

the law *prohibits* the sale of handguns without technology that transfers an alphanumeric on the shell casing
*plantiffs* in a lawsuit before the @entity1 @entity136 say since gunmakers wo *n't* make ' microstamping ' guns , the law is a de facto ban
studies into microstamping shows *reliability* of the technology *varies*
researchers believe the technology could cost under $ 10 per gun
two major gun manufacturers announced they would not make guns with microstamping , though @entity102 *continues* to sell in @entity1
