unearthed by scientists in @entity9 , the well - preserved fossil reveals the previously undiscovered species ' bones , its fins - and its distinctly grumpy - looking face			1
paleontologists in @entity16 also uncovered an equally angry - looking prehistoric pal at a quarry in the @entity20 formation			2
both of the newly discovered species are believed to date back 110 million years			1
one feisty fossil : the remains of the ' @entity25 ' was discovered by scientists in @entity16 , @entity9 , and is thought to date back 110 million years the specimens were collected at the @entity28 in @entity16 , southern @entity9			1
the first , known as @entity25 , has been identified as a new member of the ' super family ' @entity31 - a now extinct group of bony fish			0

in october a team of scientists shed new light on the appearance of the prehistoric @entity52 fish using the latest high - energy x-rays to create a 3d image of what the extinct creature would have looked like			2
the fearsome results revealed the 380 million year old fish had both jaws and teeth			0
the discovery suggested that humans too may have developed working teeth and jaws earlier than previously suspected			0
