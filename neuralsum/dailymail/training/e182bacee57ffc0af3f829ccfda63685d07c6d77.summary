but many of the most striking displays at our favourite museums have only been made possible thanks to the art , which dates back hundreds of years			2
here , in the taxidermy lab at the @entity19 in @entity20 , taxidermist @entity16 prepares a bear called @entity22 to be shown to the public			1
not a ' stuffed ' animal : taxidermist @entity16 works in his laboratory at the @entity19 in @entity20			1
she will be the star of a new exhibition set to open there in october but it is dead : the exhibition - called @entity31 , myths and realities - will present the ten bear species that exist on out planet , but will also go deeper to look at the relationship between man and bears macabre : but many of the most striking displays at our favourite museums have only been made possible thanks to the art of taxidermy , which dates back hundreds of years careful work : these days , however , professional taxidermists prefer the term ' mounting ' to ' stuffing ' , reflecting the effort that goes into the carefully sculpted bodies beneath the skin ambiguity : @entity52 , chief curator of the museum , said : ' since ancient times man has carried an ambiguous relationship with the bear , a mythical animal which is both a scary predator and a companion of children the museum already houses a collection of more than 2.5million items , but @entity63 will be the star of a large exhibition on bears set to open there this autumn			1
@entity52 , chief curator of the @entity19 , told @entity69 : ' we are currently finalising the naturalisation of @entity63 in our taxidermy laboratory and she will undoubtedly be one of the stars of the show			1

' we will discuss many legends and extraordinary stories like @entity90 , mascot of the @entity92 , which fought in the battle of @entity94 in 1944 and was even decorated ! ' would make a nice rug : to prepare the bears - and any other animal - for display they must first be skinned , which can be done in a manner similar to the way you might skin a chicken before cooking it preservation : depending on the type of skin , chemicals are added to preserve it or it may be tanned like leather , before it is mounted on a mannequin made from wood , wool and wire , or polyurethane while the preservation of animal skins has been practised almost since the beginning of recorded civilisation , the earliest modern - style taxidermy techniques were published in the middle of the 18th century to prepare the bears - and any other animal - for display they must first be skinned , which can be done without first opening the body cavity in a manner similar to the way you might skin a chicken before cooking it			0

while the preservation of animal skins has been practised almost since the beginning of recorded civilisation , the earliest modern - style techniques were published in the middle of the 18th century in @entity142			0
it was in the 19th century that hunters began taking their trophies to upholstery shops , where they would have the skins sewn up and stuffed with cotton - a crude form of taxidermy that has given us the term ' stuffed animal '			1
close up : in this picture the jawbone of another bear named @entity155 is pictured under a magnifying glass team effort : mr @entity16 prepares @entity63 's skin as a colleague works on a piece of bone these days , however , professional taxidermists prefer the term ' mounting ' to ' stuffing ' , reflecting the effort that goes into the carefully sculpted bodies beneath the skin			1
as the @entity171 - based guild of @entity172 puts it : ' to say that a taxidermist stuffs animals is misleading			2
in fact the skin is removed , preserved and arranged around a model of the original body			0
' a good knowledge of anatomy is essential to create the artificial body or ' form '			0
artistic talent is needed to finish the specimen and set up a natural display			0
' a good taxidermist is a sculptor , artist and naturalist rolled into one			2
' @entity20 's museum is billing their exhibition , which will feature bears from across the world , as the event of the year			1
it will open in october , on the centenary of the invention of the teddy bear .			0

@entity63 will be the star of a major new exhibition at the @entity19 in @entity20
