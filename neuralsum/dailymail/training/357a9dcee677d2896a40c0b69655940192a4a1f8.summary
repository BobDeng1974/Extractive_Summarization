a frustrated @entity0 , the liberal filmmaker who led cheers for @entity2 before he ascended to the @entity3 , said tuesday that he would only be remembered as @entity5 's first black president – ' and that 's it			1
' @entity2 , he said during an interview at the @entity9 , has become a ' huge disappointment ' by failing to bail out ailing cities like his hometown of @entity14			1
“ when you start turning the water off in 150,000 homes because they have n’t paid the water bill ? ' he asked			0
' turning to the @entity52 's camera , he addressed the president directly			2
' when the history is written of this era , ' @entity0 said , ' this is how you ’ll be remembered : " he was the first black president			2
" okay , not a bad accomplishment , but that 's it			1
that 's it , mr. @entity2			2
' ' a hundred years from now : " he was the first black @entity5 that got elected president			0
" and that 's it			0
eight years of your life and that ’s what people are going to remember			0
' ' boy , i got a feeling , knowing you , ' the filmmaker scolded , ' that you 'd probably wish you were remembered for a few other things , a few other things you could have done			2
' ' so , it is , on that level , a big disappointment			1
' @entity0 has come out swinging against @entity2 before			0
in 2011 , upset about the president 's military campaign in @entity83 , he tore into the chief executive on @entity85			0
' may i suggest a 50 - mile evacuation zone around @entity2 's @entity88 ? # returnspolicy , ' @entity0 tweeted			1
finincially unraveling @entity14 , @entity0 snarked , would be better off if it were in @entity47 or @entity46 because @entity2 would be paying attention to its inhabitants around the same time , he told the @entity92 that @entity2 's first term in office had been ' heartbreaking ' for liberals			1
' he did not come into office like i had hoped that he would , ' @entity0 said then , ' to do what [ president ] @entity97 did in his first few months , where he came in and said , you know , " i 'm in charge , this is the way we 're doing things , if you do n’t like it , throw me out of office "			0
' @entity0 was in @entity9 for a 25th - anniversary screening of his first film , ' @entity109 , ' which focused on @entity111 ' ceo at the time , @entity113 , whom he accused of raiding jobs and functionally destroying the @entity15 town of @entity116			1
his other controversy - laden movies include @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 : a @entity122 .			0

angry left - wing filmmaker trashed @entity126 president in @entity9 as ' a big disappointment '
said his ghost - town home city of @entity14 , @entity15 should be better off – and would be , if it were in @entity46 or @entity47
*insisted* the only historic accomplishment @entity2 will be remembered for is breaking the presidential color *barrier*
' not a bad accomplishment , but that 's it '
