all @entity0 living in @entity1 will automatically become ' @entity1 citizens ' , even if they were born in @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity5 under @entity7 's plans for independence			1
anyone classed as ' habitually resident ' will become eligible for a @entity1 passport , along with all @entity1 living around the world			1
mr @entity7 insists there will be no need for border controls with @entity3 , but @entity17 's @entity16 has signalled border guards and passport checks would have to be considered to control immigration			1
but it would be up to the @entity0 government to decide if someone can have dual citizenship between @entity0 and @entity1			2
britons living in @entity1 and @entity1 living anyehwere in the world ' will automatically be considered @entity1 citizens ' , under mr @entity7 's plans			1
this will include @entity0 citizens who hold dual citizenship with another country			2
other people will be able to register or apply for @entity1 citizenship on independence based on ' clear criteria '			2
all @entity1 citizens will have the right to acquire a @entity1 passport , although there will be no requirement to hold one			2
mr @entity7 also hopes for an independent @entity50 to join @entity51 ( @entity51 ) which dates back to the 1920s and allows free movement between the @entity0 , @entity5 , the @entity54 and the @entity55			1
the official white paper for independence states : ' we plan to remain part of the @entity51 which means that there will be no border controls , and you will not need a passport to travel to other parts of the @entity0 , @entity5 , the @entity54 and the @entity55			1
' however , mr @entity7 also wants to have a more relaxed immigration policy than that adopted by @entity67 , raising the prospect of @entity1 being used as a back door route into the @entity0			1
the @entity70 plans to lower the current financial maintenance thresholds and minimum salary levels for entry to @entity1 , and to reintroduce a ' post-study work visa '			0
it means it would effectively have a more open immigration policy than the rest of the @entity0 , requiring controls at the border			1
the changes would take effect from 24 march 2016 when @entity1 would formally become an independent country			0
@entity1 's first minister @entity7 , canvassing in @entity85 , @entity86 today , has insisted @entity0 citizens will not have to take a @entity1 passport mr @entity7 pictured speaking with @entity89 , who will be one tomorrow , and mum @entity90 has rejected claims from no campaigners that there would need to be border checks to enter and leave @entity3 at the weekend mr @entity16 said the only way to maintain an open border was to reject independence			1
' if you do n't want borders , vote to stay in the @entity0 , ' the @entity17 leader said in an interview with today 's @entity102			2
asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was prime minister , mr @entity16 warned : ' it would have to be looked at			1
' and mr @entity16 's spokesman added last night : ' the last time i looked there were two sides to the border - and we would be in charge of one of them			0
it would be up to us , not mr @entity7 , to secure our northern border			0
' a spokesman for @entity50 said : ' existing @entity0 passports can continue to be used as normal until they expire			0
people will travel freely over the border between @entity1 and @entity3 just as they travel freely from @entity5 to @entity5			2
' @entity1 will negotiate its ongoing membership of the @entity125 in the 18 months between the referendum and @entity127 in march 2016 - as professor @entity128 has pointed out : " the overwhelming body of expert opinion is that @entity1 's @entity125 membership will be uninterrupted			0
" ' so no queuing at airports will be necessary			0
' mr @entity7 's @entity135 on independence set out who would get automatic @entity1 citizenship and who would have to apply passport please : our artists ' impression of a road border between @entity3 and @entity1 post-independence earlier this year @entity1 secretary @entity144 accused the @entity70 of having ' two fundamentally contradictory propositions '			1
' first of all they say we can be part of the @entity51 , which [ would be ] an open border between @entity1 and the rest of the @entity0 , and at the same time they say they will have a widely divergent immigration policy			1
' you can have either of these things , but you can not have them both			0
my challenge to the @entity160 is to explain which of these it is going to be			0
' mr @entity144 said the @entity70 's immigration proposals are ' radically different ' and would be ' incompatible ' with the @entity51			0
it means travellers heading south could be forced to pull over and undergo lengthy @entity166 - style identity checks on 21 roads that cross the border , including the @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171			0
rail passengers would also need to prove they had a right to enter the country before boarding a train leaving from @entity176 , @entity177 or @entity86 for @entity3 , in a similar time - consuming regime to @entity180 journeys from @entity181			0
a @entity67 analysis paper , launched in january , also revealed that lorries and vans could be inspected at the @entity3 border if @entity1 becomes independent amid fears of alcohol and tobacco smuggling .			0

all @entity0 citizens living north of the border will ' automatically ' become @entity1
@entity1 living anywhere in the world would also get @entity1 citizenship
all @entity1 will be able to get a @entity1 passport but will not be forced
@entity7 wants open borders to @entity0 , @entity5 , @entity54 and @entity55
but no campaign says relaxed immigration policy makes it *impossible*
raises the prospect of border guards and passport checks to enter @entity0
