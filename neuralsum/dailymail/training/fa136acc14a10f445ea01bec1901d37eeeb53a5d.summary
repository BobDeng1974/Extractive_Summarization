@entity0 has been sacked as manager of @entity2			1
rovers were relegated last season and had hoped to make an immediate return to @entity6 but have made a poor start to life in the bottom division under @entity0 , who replaced @entity10 at the end of may			1
saturday 's home defeat to @entity13 was @entity2 's seventh league loss of the campaign and their fourth on the spin in a seven - game winless run that has left the @entity20 club bottom of the @entity21			1
@entity0 has been sacked by @entity2 after less than five months in charge of the club @entity2 chairman @entity24 told the club 's official website , tranmererovers.co.uk : ' @entity0 is a decent man who has worked very hard over the past few months for the football club			1
' however , with the club currently sitting at the bottom of @entity31 for the first time in 32 years it was decided this was the right time to make the break			0
' i remain committed to the vision , that @entity0 shared , of playing free - flowing and skilful football			2
' and while we have shown in some of our periods of play that we are not far off being able to achieve that - we have not been able to do it consistently			0
' we have also not been sufficiently pragmatic when circumstances demanded that we close out a game to secure a win			0
' if we are to achieve the required results in future it is clear that we need to strengthen the squad further			0
' @entity13 's @entity49 ( third from left ) scores his side 's winner against @entity2 to keep them bottom @entity24 went on to highlight the need for the next manager to have good contacts to help with the recruitment of new players			1
he added : ' our recruitment department , which has been depleted by years of under - investment , is being supplemented and strengthened			0
' but in the short term our ability to find new players to cover injuries and to supplement the existing line up will also depend on having in place a manager with an extensive network of contacts in the game			1
' this will therefore be one of the key attributes that i will be looking for in a replacement for @entity0			2
' @entity2 have won just two matches this season			2
both victories - away at @entity76 and at home to @entity78 - came in august .			0
