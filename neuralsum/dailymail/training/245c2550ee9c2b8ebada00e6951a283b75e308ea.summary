by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 03:46 est , 23 october 2012 frustrated villagers fed up with drivers careering through a dangerous ford have put up a blunt sign warning ‘ idiots with twattnavs , meet thy doom ’			1
those behind the unofficial tin sign say impatient drivers regularly ignore warning notices and instead follow their @entity14 directions through the ford – even when it is several feet high with water			1
they came up with the unique deterrent following numerous vehicle rescues			1
frustrated villager erected the blunt sign following a number of rescues from the ford @entity25 is considering closing the ford in @entity27 because of the danger caused by drivers who refuse to turn back down the narrow country lane and risk crossing the water			1
@entity32 , who owns a smallholding nearby has had to rescue dozens of motorists from the ford through the @entity36 , where closure signs regularly disappear			1
he said : ‘ there are big red signs saying road closed and there are barriers , but people are driving through it			2
‘ people are leaving the plastic barriers flat in the road and driving across them			0
’ he said villagers had seen several motorists driving through the ford recently , even when the river was several feet higher than usual following heavy rain			2
‘ there were two people 's cars stuck in the ford last week ’ he added			2
the ford , which straddles the @entity60 - @entity59 border in @entity61 , was closed in april after a man died while trying to drive through the ford			1
it is due to remain shut for 18 months - and might even be sealed off permanently , the county council has said			0
the ford has been the site of numerous rescues in the past			1
floods can cause the river - normally just a few inches deep - to rise to more than six feet			0
many drivers have been rescued after ignoring the warning signs not to cross the ford after heavy rain the ford often floods but many drivers ignore the warnings , refusing to turn back down the country lane @entity82 parish council chairman @entity81 said the ideal option would be to ‘ completely seal it off for all time ’ , but conceded that it might pose problems for local farmers who rely on it to get tractors and heavy machinery to their fields			1
problems have been made worse by roadworks on the busy @entity95 to @entity97 road , which has led to impatient drivers using the lane where the ford is located as a rat run to get round the congestion			2
a @entity104 spokesman said they plan to install larger barriers			0
he added : ‘ although the local highways team inspect the barriers at the ford regularly they can not monitor them 24 hours a day			0
‘ we recognise that the closure will cause some people inconvenience by having to drive around the traffic diversion routes , but it is important to maintain the safety of the travelling public			0
’ @entity118 , of @entity119 , said : ‘ these fords we class as very dangerous because of the force of the water ... six inches of water can lift a car			0
‘ even if you get your car through the water can damage your engine , you 're potentially going to get a big bill and the insurance company wo n't pay it			0
do n't go through it , turn around			0
