by @entity0 for the @entity1 captured on @entity3 , this is the moment that turf war erupted in a quiet suburban street – as a couple had their front garden stolen by two middle - aged lawn thieves			1
the women were filmed methodically rolling up the newly - laid turf , before scurrying off down the road			1
the shameless pair had to make seven return trips to strip the garden bare – and even stopped half - way through for a cigarette break			2
mr @entity28 , 51 , who owns a beauty salon , said his neighbour had spent all day carefully levelling his front garden before neatly laying the strips of turf			1
‘ he ’d done a fantastic job			0
i went in to work and i had a phone call asking to check my cctv because the turf had been stolen			2
i could n’t believe it			0
’ mr @entity28 , of @entity45 , @entity46 , said he was stunned by the footage			1
‘ it was shamefully funny			1
i could n’t stop laughing , ’ he admitted			1
daylight robbery : the woman in the pink jumper strides away from the scene - presumably to a getaway car well - earned break : the brazen thieves appear to stop for a cigarette half - way through the turf heist ‘ it was about 5am in the morning ... it was dark when they started , but when they finished it had got light			1
it took about 40 minutes to an hour – half - way through they stopped and had a smoke and a sit down on my wall			0
’ mr @entity28 said he had heard rumours that the perpetrators were a mother - and - daughter team			1
‘ it was cheeky , but the turf must have cost at most £ 30 – it does n’t even seem worth it , ’ he said			0
‘ i could n’t stop laughing			1
i was annoyed at the same time though			0
i do n’t know where they took the turf , because that ’s off - camera , but they must have been loading it up somewhere			2
‘ we live in a quiet neighbourhood and we have older people living behind these houses , and i worry for them if this goes any further			0
’ the owners of the stolen turf were too upset to talk about the raid yesterday			0
they fear they may fall victim to similar ‘ pranks ’ unless the pair are caught			0
a spokesman for @entity95 confirmed that the incident had been reported , and that officers were investigating			0
she said : ‘ we ’re at the stage that there are no further lines of inquiry , but would appeal to anyone with information to come forward			0
’ turf wars : the second thief , wearing black , was also filmed carrying away a rolled - up strip of the lawn			2
