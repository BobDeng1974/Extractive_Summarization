@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is set to be out for a month after suffering a muscle injury			1

@entity1 manager @entity8 revealed the news on friday as his side prepared for a home clash with @entity12 on saturday			1
@entity0 has been ruled out of action for a month with a muscle rupture the @entity15 described the injury as a ' muscle rupture ' and said that the @entity19 international could be out for around four weeks			1
@entity20 added that there was better news surrounding winger @entity23			2
the former @entity25 man has revelled in @entity20 's 3 - 5 - 2 system and has been missed since tearing a hamstring in the @entity29 draw with @entity30			2
but the manager said he is now nearing full fitness , but would not be ready in time for the visit of @entity36 's bottom - of - the - table @entity34			2
@entity20 will be hoping @entity1 can end a run of two goals in the last three matches			1
but he says opponents are making it hard for his expensively assembled side			2
' we have to play against teams who make the space very narrow , defending with 10 people behind the ball then it is always difficult , ' he explained			2
@entity0 's injury is just one of dozens of injuries the @entity54 club have had this season ' we have to play more quickly with high ball speed and disorganise the opponent			1
we have to improve our ball speed			0
' @entity20 refused to blame his misfiring frontline for the problem			0
' you have criticised our defence , now we have one of the best defences in the @entity63 , ' he said			0
' now you are talking about the attack and we are still a force in the attack			0
i ’ve said before it ’s not the defence , it ’s the team organisation			0
the strikers have a big part in it but it is not only them			0
' @entity20 added that he hoped his side would learn from the previous encounter with @entity12 when @entity1 let a 3 - 1 lead turn into a 5 - 3 humbling			1
' we do n’t control the match even when we are three against one , ' he said			0
' that is happening always in football			0
that is also the beauty of football but as a top club you have to control a match and when you are in a good result like 3 or 2 - 1 you have to finish the match			0
