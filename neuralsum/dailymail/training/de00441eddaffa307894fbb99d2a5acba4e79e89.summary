by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:21 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 18:39 est , 9 september 2013 shamed ex-cabinet minister @entity2 was still blaming everyone but himself yesterday for his spectacular downfall			1
@entity2 was jailed in march for perverting the course of justice by persuading his then wife to take his speeding points on her driving licence so he would escape a ban			1
the eight - month sentence , of which he served only 62 days , brought his political career to a humiliating end			2
it followed months of lies in which he repeatedly denied the offence – only to admit his guilt on the eve of his trial			0
ex-cabinet minister @entity2 claimed that his downfall was ' payback ' for speaking out about phone - hacking but @entity2 claimed yesterday that he was the victim of a @entity24 vendetta and his downfall was ‘ payback ’ after he spoke out about phone - hacking			1
his attempt to blame the @entity24 for his woes was quickly slapped down by @entity29			1
asked about @entity2 ’s ‘ bizarre ’ allegations , mr @entity29 – whom he challenged for the @entity32 leadership – said : ‘ it is his opinion			1
is it exactly my opinion ? no it is n’t			2
’ @entity2 , 58 , said the @entity38 targeted him to expose his affair with his aide @entity40 , which resulted in the break - up of his marriage			1
the @entity44 then ‘ groomed ’ his ex-wife @entity45 , he said , until she told the newspaper about taking his speeding points			1
miss @entity45 , 60 , was also convicted over the 2003 speeding incident on the @entity49 and jailed for eight months			1
sentencing the couple , mr @entity50 , told them ‘ any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault ’			0
@entity2 said the @entity38 targeted him to expose his affair with @entity40 ( pictured together ) the judge told @entity2 , whose attempt to avoid conviction ran up prosecution costs of more than £ 100,000 : ‘ despite your high office you tried to lie your way out of trouble			1
’ @entity2 has admitted he ‘ lied and lied again ’ but there was no mention of that in his column for yesterday ’s @entity68 , where he made his claims			1
of the exposure of his relationship with bisexual miss @entity40 , 46 – weeks after he had cynically portrayed himself as a happy family man during the 2010 election – he wrote : ‘ my endgame began when @entity75 , the chief reporter of the now - defunct @entity38 , heard gossip that i was having an affair			0
‘ rather than cheapskating on the proposed investigation by hacking my phone , the @entity38 put me under extensive surveillance by a retired policeman , a more expensive exercise			0
' why was @entity83 prepared to invest so much to tail an opposition @entity32 back in 2009 ? @entity2 and @entity45 were both jailed for perverting the course of justice after she took his penalty points @entity2 claimed that his economist ex-wife @entity45 was ' groomed ' by @entity44 ‘ maybe it was coincidence , but that summer i was the only frontbencher who , with @entity29 ’s brave backing , called for the @entity94 to reopen the voicemail - hacking inquiry into @entity98 ’s empire			1
the @entity38 sparked the end of my marriage , but another @entity98 title , the @entity44 , then groomed my ex-wife until she told them about the speeding points			1
‘ the political editor bought dinners , sent flowers , offered breaks at smart hotels , and reassured her that she would not face any unpleasant consequences ( such as prison )			0
‘ four successive weeks as the splash in the @entity44 ensured our joint prosecution			0
' @entity115 loves a celebrity trial			0
it was the end of my political career , and it locked up my ex-wife too			2
’ @entity2 dismissed swapping the speeding points with his wife as something that ‘ seemed like a minor matter ’ and said an @entity124 survey found that 300,000 motorists have done the same thing			1
but he did concede he was ‘ not proud ’ of his behaviour and said the ‘ personal consequences were monstrous for my family and me ’			0
on @entity132 ’s today programme yesterday , @entity2 acknowledged that he had made himself ‘ vulnerable ’ by asking his wife to take his points			2
but he added : ‘ sometimes newspaper groups , media groups , have their own interests as well			0
‘ @entity98 in particular is exceptionally powerful and over many , many years , he has played the person rather than the issue and he has also used that political influence to bulldoze a way for his business interests			0
‘ the way in which this was specifically done was a very clear payback			2
’ @entity44 editor @entity145 described @entity2 ’s claims as ‘ bizarre , ’ adding : ‘ the @entity44 pursued a legitimate story of considerable public interest			1
’ @entity29 said he did not ' exactly agree ' with @entity2 's claims ( pictured together in 2007 ) mr @entity75 took to @entity150 to hit back			1
he said the @entity2 was not a ‘ @entity98 press target ’ and that it had taken a year to persuade his editor to run the affair story			1
mr @entity75 added : ‘ the “ @entity98 press ” thought @entity2 was such a political minnow they did n’t want to run it			2
’ former @entity160 minister @entity159 also criticised @entity2 via @entity150			1
‘ so @entity2 blames @entity98 for his downfall			1
i thought he lied and broke the law			0
some ex-politicians never learn , ’ she said			0
asked whether it was fair for newspapers to expose @entity2 ’s lies , mr @entity29 said : ‘ newspapers play an incredibly important job in keeping people in positions of authority on their toes , uncovering wrongdoing where that takes place , uncovering the truth where it is not revealed			1
‘ that is the great tradition of @entity180 journalism			0
’ @entity2 brazenly issued denial after denial of the driving licence claims			1
they included : may 16 , 2011 : in a statement , @entity2 says the allegations are ‘ incorrect ’			2
he adds : ‘ they have been made before and they have been shown to be untrue			0
’ july 7 , 2011 : on @entity132 ’s today programme , he says : ‘ i am saying there is no truth in those allegations ... if cabinet ministers resigned every time wild allegations were made about them , you would find it difficult to get enough people around the @entity199 table			0
’ september 20 , 2011 : at the @entity32 conference , @entity2 says : ‘ i ’ve very clearly denied this			2
i continue to very strongly deny this			0
’ asked if he would ‘ swear it ’ , he says : ‘ absolutely			0
i ’ve made that absolutely and abundantly clear			0
’ february 3 , 2012 : resigning as energy secretary as he is charged , @entity2 says : ‘ i ’m innocent of these charges and i intend to fight this			2
’ despite his protestations yesterday , the press ’s right to report on @entity2 ’s affair was backed by the @entity214 last year			2
in a victory for press freedom , miss @entity40 lost a privacy and harassment claim			0
mr @entity219 ruled that a married mp ’s ‘ secret mistress ’ is a public figure and rejected her claim for damages against the @entity225 and @entity226			0
he said she was ‘ not the purely private figure she claimed to be ’ because of her involvement with @entity2 ‘ both professionally , as his press agent , and personally , as his secret mistress , in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of @entity235 about how much he valued his family ’			2
in a damning judgment , in which he accused her of seriously exaggerating some of her evidence and described her as not a ‘ good or reliable witness ’ , the judge added : ‘ miss @entity40 has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome			0

@entity2 said his downfall was ' payback ' for speaking about *phonehacking*
@entity251 ' groomed ' his ex-wife @entity45 into selling story
claims slapped down by @entity29 who said he not share his opinion
@entity2 criticised by journalists who called his claims ' bizarre '
