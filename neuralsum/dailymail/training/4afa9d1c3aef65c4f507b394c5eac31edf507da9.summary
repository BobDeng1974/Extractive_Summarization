by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 11:12 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 03:08 est , 5 december 2012 they played a key role when the young couple walked down the aisle			2
and now prince @entity8 and @entity10 's sister , socialite @entity9 , are favourite to become godparents to their child			1
it is no secret the siblings are two of the most important people in the young couple 's life and if the royal tradition of appointing the best man and maid of honour from their wedding is observed they will definitely be offered the roles			1
new role : prince @entity8 and @entity10 's sister @entity27 are favourites to become godparents to the new royal baby happily married : only 20 months after the couple were married they are now expecting a baby			1
the baby will become monarch , regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl @entity39 , managing editor of the majesty royal magazine , said his money would be on the siblings : ' i think @entity8 and @entity27 are very likely			2
' as you know most people have just one or two godparents			1
but in royal circles you have a lot more , certainly @entity51 had quite a team			1
' i rather think they wo n't have quite so many - perhaps four			2
@entity8 would take care of the royal connection and @entity27 would take care of the @entity9 side			2
' there are few options amongst their close friends			1
the @entity61 and the @entity62 certainly			1
' @entity63 has been one of the @entity8 's closest friends since they first met at @entity65			1
@entity66 , also known as ' @entity67 ' , accompanied the prince on his first official tour to @entity70 and @entity51 and prince @entity8 are patrons of a memorial fund dedicated to his brother @entity73 , who was killed in a car crash in 2002			1
possibility ? the van @entity77 are among those also hotly tipped to become godparents			1
@entity81 , pictured , is prince @entity51 's god daughter			1
she stole the show at the @entity83 when she grumpily covered her ears during a noisy flypast @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 are close family friends from @entity91 who have known the prince since childhood			1
three - year - old @entity81 - who almost stole the show at the @entity83 when she was pictured clapping her hands over her ears during a noisy @entity96 fly past - is @entity51 ’s god - daughter and the son of @entity99 and @entity100 , a friend of @entity51 and @entity8			1
mr @entity39 added : ' @entity51 is a godfather of several children , one of whom was @entity104 , the little bridesmaid covering her ears on the balcony on their wedding day			1
' quite possibly the favour will be returned to them			2
' i would say @entity8 and @entity27 , a @entity100 , and maybe one of @entity10 's close chums from school and that might be it			2
' in the past there have been a shed load more godparents , both royal and non royal , but i do n't think they will want do things on such a grand scale			2
that was then and this is now			0
' whoever it is it would have been given careful consideration			0
it would be a huge honour to be the godparent of a future @entity131 or @entity132			0
' bookmakers are already offering odds on who will take on the important role with @entity27 and @entity8 being odds on favourites			2
the couple 's first child will push prince @entity8 into fourth place in the line of succession to the throne - even if they have a girl			1
prince @entity51 and @entity10 's child would move into third place , become more important than @entity8 and not be subject to the centuries - old law of primogeniture , which puts male heirs ahead of women			1
he or she will leapfrog @entity8 by being be the first born of first - in - line prince @entity155 's first son			1
so close : @entity156 of @entity157 , ( centre ) , prince @entity51 ( right ) and @entity8 ( left ) wave as they pass the @entity161 during the @entity162 in june the baby will be third in line to the throne regardless of gender after prime minister @entity167 agreed a deal with other @entity170 countries to change the rules on the royal line of succession which means male heirs will no longer be given priority			1
this means that in the 15 other countries where the @entity132 is head of state the rules must be changed			0
it had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed			0
but the announcement that the @entity10 is expecting the couple 's first child - third in line to the throne - has come after the deal was agreed			2
in october 2011 , @entity167 announced that the 16 @entity170 countries where the @entity132 is head of state had agreed to give female royals the same rights of succession as their brothers			0
' put simply , if the @entity196 and @entity10 were to have a little girl , that girl would one day be our queen , ” mr @entity167 said			0
the changes mean that , for all descendants of the @entity8 , younger sons will no longer take precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession			0
members of the @entity208 who marry a @entity209 will also in future be able to succeed to the @entity210			0
and an ancient and unused rule saying descendants of @entity213 are supposed to gain the consent of the monarch to marry will only apply to the first six people in the line of succession			0
the law was brought in following the @entity219 – when a @entity221 invasion helped overthrow a @entity223 king – so that a @entity209 could never sit on our throne again			0
it also means that the princess royal , the @entity132 ’s second born , is just tenth in line to the throne behind her younger brothers @entity232 ( fourth ) and @entity86 ( seventh )			0
the 15 other countries where @entity132 is queen are @entity235 , @entity70 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , the @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , the @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 and the @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 , and @entity250 and @entity251			0
the @entity170 leaders also agreed to overturn the @entity253 , which means that only the @entity255 heirs of the @entity256 , granddaughter of @entity257 , can become king or queen			0
the @entity132 hailed the deal on changing the rules as the 53 @entity170 countries met last year , saying she wanted the theme of allowing women to play a full part to last for years			0
she said : ' the theme this year is women @entity267			0
' it reminds us of the potential in our societies that is yet to be fully unlocked and it encourages us to find ways to allow all girls and women to play their full part			0
' we must continue to strive in our own countries and across the @entity170 together to promote that theme in a lasting way beyond this year			0
' her comments were taken as a sign that the @entity132 approves of the reform .			0

the pair , who took lead roles at the wedding , are odds on to be named godparents
also in the running are @entity51 's old friends the @entity292 and the @entity62
the prince is godfather to several children and is expected to ' return the favour '
