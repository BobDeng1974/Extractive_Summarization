@entity0 , already a mother of six children , is waiting to give birth			0
but she will not enjoy the privacy of her own delivery room , her husband @entity5 by her side			1
instead , @entity0 will be one of the 300 new mothers crammed into the wards at the dr @entity13 in @entity15 , the capital of the @entity9 , which sees , on average , 60 new babies come into the world every single day			1
space at the maternity wing is at a premium , so @entity0 and her new baby will share with other mothers , usually five to a bed but sometimes more , and she will give birth as part of a group of six when the time comes			1
here , @entity0 and her husband @entity5 eke out a living on his daily salary of 380 pesos ( £ 6 ) , augmented by @entity0 's embroidery work which brings in around 280 pesos ( £ 4 ) every few days			2
' even if you have no work , you still have to pay the bills , ' explains @entity5			0
' i have two jobs for my family 's sake			2
' i 'll do anything to earn more money for my family , odd jobs - even if it 's on a sunday			2
' back at the hospital , @entity0 is having her final check up with one of the nurses at the dr @entity58			1
watched by documentary film maker @entity59 , @entity0 discusses the blood donors she will need to bring to the birth with a brisk , efficient nurse			2
queued up : labouring women have to share the delivery suite with at least five other expectant mothers documentary : film maker @entity59 surrounded by some of the new mothers at the @entity15 hospital the @entity9 is chronically short of blood which makes bagged blood enormously expensive and out of reach for someone like @entity0			1
but with a seventh baby on the way , haemorrhage is a real risk so she 's arranged for a friend to be at the hospital during the delivery along with @entity5			1
' it would be better to have three donors , ' chides the midwife			2
' because here in @entity58 , three donors is the equivalent of the amount of blood that would be used for you			0
' we prepare for your delivery because we do n't know if you will bleed at the time of your delivery			2
remember it 's your seventh pregnancy			2
' seven children is not unusual in the @entity9			0
in @entity35 , families of 10 or even 12 are common , and as a result , at peak times , midwives at the dr @entity58 can deliver as many as 100 babies within a 24 - hour period			1
' sometimes , during high season , 13 to 16 babies are in the delivery room at the same time , ' @entity104 , a resident doctor , said			1
' it 's chaotic but an organised chaos			2
we can still manage – no baby drops out on the floor			0
' privacy : for mothers like @entity0 , there 's no room where they can spend time alone with their newborn experienced : chief midwife @entity118 , left , has delivered an estimated 200,000 babies chief midwife @entity118 has delivered so many babies , she finds it impossible to remember how many she has brought into the world			1
' i 'm sorry but i ca n't remember [ how many babies i 've delivered ] , ' she tells @entity59			1
' it 's so many ! maybe 200,000			1
i 've been here since 1986 , almost 28 years			0
' one in five of central @entity15 's mothers come here to deliver their babies , and midwives work day and night			1
as a result , conditions in the hospital are grim , with queues of pregnant women waiting in the reception area and hundreds more squeezed into the tiled wards			1
those on the verge of giving birth are packed into a tiny labour room			2
' there are five in a bed , sometimes we have more , ' notes @entity118 , who points to women being wheeled into the delivery room , at the very last minute , in groups of six or more			1
but for @entity0 , giving birth in front of five others is the least of her worries			0
although the dr @entity58 is a public hospital , operations have to be paid for			1
as a result , she and @entity5 live in fear of complications and a hugely expensive caesarian section			0
uncomfortable : post partum mothers are crammed into beds while their babies wait in a nearby nursery @entity161 : a group of nurses and midwives cluster around a mother giving birth - there 's no privacy at all ' i 'm worried because it 's her [ @entity0 's ] due date , ' explains @entity5 as he waits nervously by his wife 's side			1
' i am also concerned with the child , whether it 's going to be a normal delivery or by caesarian			1
' if she does n't have a normal birth , we will be in financial trouble			0
the budget is our number one problem			0
' ' i will force myself to give birth by normal delivery , ' adds @entity0			2
' i just want a normal delivery			0
i can not accept a caesarian section			0
' i hope to have a problem - free delivery			0
that 's what i pray for - that we will be ok when i give birth			0
' luckily for @entity0 , her birth is a smooth one			0
' there 's no screaming , there 's no babies crying , everyone is very controlled and composed , ' comments a watching @entity59			1
newborns : documentary maker @entity59 with two of the babies born at the world 's busiest maternity ward disgusting : like many on the maternity ward , @entity0 lives in @entity35 - a teeming slum built on a rubbish dump ' i do n't know what that says about @entity9 women , something about their psyche ... just like that , another baby is born			1
' when @entity0 's baby boy finally makes his appearance , the new mother is relieved , if apprehensive about his future			0
' if the child can finish his studies , i hope he wo n't be like us where you need to work just to be able to eat , ' she says			0
' there should be a limit on the amount of children you have			0
that is why i am teaching them not to follow in my footsteps and have lots of babies			0
' wise words , but for @entity240 and her busy team of midwives , the 24 - hour round of births continues			0
@entity245 ’s @entity244 airs on thursday 31 october at 9pm on @entity246			1
