by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 01:31 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 01:31 est , 26 july 2013 a new report claims that shocking video of two @entity6 men abusing a @entity8 woman at a nightclub in @entity11 was staged - and that the villains in the footage were actually paid actors			1
when the video was posted online in june , it caused fury in @entity8 and in the @entity17			0
many @entity18 said that it only proved their suspicions about @entity6 expatriates living in @entity8			1
westerners were horrified about how it portrayed ex-pats			0
now , the @entity25 reports that the men are speaking out , anonymously , and claiming they were paid $ 90 to play roles and that the entire horrifying scene was ' all in good fun			0
' a @entity8 man who claims to be the ' director ' of the film showed the @entity25 two alternate takes from the same video - which seems to support the story about the footage being from a planned film shoot			1
disturbing : this image grab from a video uploaded to @entity40 shows a @entity6 man grabbing a young @entity8 woman by the face as she tries to push him away abuse : but despite the woman 's protestations , the man continues to force her face towards the camera the original 78 - second clip shows a young @entity6 club - goer with an @entity53 accent grabbing the woman around her face before repeatedly poking her in her mouth and nose while a third person films it			1
after poking the woman in nose , the man then can be heard shouting : ' i see a booger ' while his friend eggs him on , saying : ' dude , make her eat it			0
' the two men can then be heard laughing as he pushes his finger in to her mouth at the unnamed nightclub in @entity8			2
they then continue to abuse the girl by telling her she is disgusting and tells her she needs plastic surgery ' like every other little @entity8 '			1
the woman , who appears to be worse - for - wear , apparently tells the man to leave her alone and tries to push him away			2
but he continue to harass her by grabbing at her face and body until she eventually manages to get free and leaves			0
cruelty : the @entity6 man then continues to poke her in the face while telling the person filming : ' i can see a booger ' who then replies : ' dude , make her eat it ' shame : the @entity8 woman tries to push the man away as he tells her she is ' disgusting ' and should have plastic surgery ' just like every other little @entity8 ' since the release of the video the men have reached out to numerous ex-pat and @entity6 news sources in @entity8 proclaiming their innocence			1
however , their evidence that the video was actually staged as a movie is shaky at best			0
they said they were paid in cash by the @entity8 man who recruited them and could not provide a name of the film company he worked with or the movie he was working on			2
the video was shot on an @entity110 and they have no pay stubs to prove they were hired as actors			0
the only proof is a screen shot of a @entity117 chat between one of the actors an the supposed director			0
the video quickly went viral after it was uploaded to @entity40 and embedded on the @entity8 web portal @entity123 on june 8 and has been covered by the @entity8 press			1
the publicity has sparked a widespread debate over the way @entity6 tourists treat women while visiting @entity8			1
ill - treatment : the woman eventually manages to get out of the man 's grasp and walks away			2

the 78 - second - long clip was apparently filmed in a nightclub in @entity8
it shows a @entity6 man grabbing the face of a young @entity8 woman
he pokes her while telling her she 's disgusting and needs plastic surgery
@entity146 sparked outrage across @entity8 after being uploaded to @entity40
