having plied his trade among @entity3 's elite for over a decade it 's fair to say @entity5 knows a player			1
winning the @entity9 twice , the former @entity8 midfielder can identify exactly what it takes to formulate a team to lift the continent 's biggest prize			1
now at @entity16 , the @entity15 has picked his greatest ever @entity9 xi - starting with @entity17 and ending with @entity18			1
here is @entity5 's team and why he picked them in his own words			1
and he 's played with or against them all			2
scroll down to view the @entity23 in pitch form @entity5 ( celebrating in the @entity26 final in 2005 ) has picked his @entity9 dream team @entity5 has clinched the biggest club competition in world football on two occasions in his career the central midfielder now plies his trade with @entity34 champions @entity16 @entity5 laughs with @entity36 's @entity35 earlier this season over in @entity37 @entity17 teams played for : @entity39 , @entity16 wins : 2013 i have played with some fantastic goalkeepers , but he is the best			1
it is n’t just the ability he has to make saves , but how good he is outfield and the fantastic composure that he always shows on the ball			2
@entity16 goalkeeper @entity17 is between the sticks in @entity5 's @entity53 @entity54 team played for : @entity16 wins : 2013 such a great player for @entity16 , his leadership and qualities have been missed while he has been injured			1
hopefully we will have him back for some important matches before the end of the season			2
he is comfortably one of the top five defenders of the last 10 years			2
@entity37 's @entity66 - winning captain @entity54 is stationed at right back for @entity5 @entity67 teams played for : @entity69 wins : 2014 when @entity67 is mentally on the top of his game , then i think he is the best there is			1
he is a leader , he gives everything , and as a player in midfield he is the sort of defender that makes you feel very comfortable being behind you			2
@entity67 scored for @entity69 during the @entity9 final win against @entity82 last season @entity84 teams played for : @entity86 wins : 2006 , 2009 , 2011 so important for @entity89 ’s success at the @entity90 in 2008 and then was even better when we won the @entity66 in 2010			1
so dependable at the back , and then scored that winning goal against @entity37 in the semi-final			0
@entity95 teams played for : @entity16 wins : 2013 one of those players who i think does not get the recognition outside of @entity37 and @entity101 he deserves			1
maybe the most complete full back in the world who can attack and defend brilliantly			0
when i joined @entity16 it was him and @entity17 who impressed me the most			0
@entity84 ( lifting the trophy in 2009 ) is at centre - back with @entity95 ( right ) out on the left @entity110 teams played for : @entity112 , @entity69 wins : 2002 i played against him when he was at @entity69 and also against @entity116 , then of course he was part of the staff when i was playing for @entity69			1
at his peak he was on a different level to anybody , made the most difficult of things look easy			0
@entity110 scored an incredible goal for @entity69 against @entity125 in the 2002 final @entity127 teams played for : @entity129 wins : 1999 , 2008 in @entity89 you would not believe how well respected he is by professionals and journalists			0
maybe because he was quiet off the field he never got the right praise in @entity137 because he likes to keep a low profile			0
technically he could have played in any league in the world			0
@entity129 's @entity127 watches as his effort flies into the @entity86 net at @entity143 @entity144 teams played for : @entity86 wins : 2006 , 2009 , 2011 such an intelligent player , and proof that you do n’t have to cover 100 miles to be effective			0
so much of @entity89 ’s success was because we played with so many midfield players , and @entity144 was at the centre of everything			0
@entity86 captain @entity144 has been the heartbeat of the @entity157 ' side for years @entity158 teams played for : @entity8 wins : 2005 he is a great friend and has been a big influence on my life			0
as a player it is about so much more than his obvious ability			0
it ’s his behaviour , his leadership , the values that he stands for and what he represents as a captain			0
@entity158 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity5 ( second right ) after @entity8 beat @entity174 in the 2005 final @entity176 teams played for : @entity129 , @entity69 wins : 2008 , 2014 if you looked at his goalscoring record for @entity69 and you had n’t witnessed it yourself , then you just would n’t believe that it is possible			1
i have been privileged to play with some amazing players , but he is the best			0
@entity69 's @entity176 wheels away after scoring against @entity82 in @entity187 last year @entity18 teams played for : @entity86 wins : 2006 , 2009 , 2011 to have two players like @entity18 and @entity176 in the same era is pretty rare			1
the individual brilliance that they are capable of sets them apart			0
it is no surprise that they have won so many @entity199 between them			2
@entity18 's goalscoring record since breaking through at @entity86 has been phenomenal			1

@entity5 has picked his @entity9 dream team
@entity18 and @entity176 are both up front
there are surprise *inclusions* for @entity67 and @entity95
