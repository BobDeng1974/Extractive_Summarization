@entity0 insists @entity1 must not overreact to the pressure building after succumbing to a fifth successive defeat in saturday 's 31 - 28 setback against @entity5			1
seven days after @entity6 departed @entity8 convincing winners , @entity10 's men were flattered by the scoreline once again as concerns continue to mount with just 10 games remaining until the launch of next year 's @entity15			1
all five losses have been inflicted by the @entity17 and @entity5 , the sport 's top two sides , but in the second @entity1 wilted before opponents who performed well below their best			1
@entity1 flanker @entity0 is halted by @entity5 scrum - half @entity21 at @entity8 @entity0 ( left ) and head coach @entity10 digest their 31 - 28 defeat after the final whistle team selection , tactics and the dwindling levels of self - belief are being scrutinised closely with head coach @entity10 facing the strongest criticism of his 32 - @entity32 reign as head coach			1
@entity10 , who has presided over just two victories in 13 meetings with the @entity37 heavyweights , has sounded a note of defiance by declaring ' we 'll not panic nor lose our nerve nor deviate from the course we 're on '			1
it is a bold message shared by @entity0 as must - win tests against @entity45 and @entity46 loom on the @entity8 horizon			2
@entity5 centre @entity48 seized on a sloppy @entity50 pass to race away for an easy score @entity52 had a difficult afternoon and could be dropped for @entity53 fly half @entity54 against @entity45 @entity55 struggled against the powerful @entity57 pack and coughed up possession three times ' it 's not the end of the world			1
it 's disappointing to lose in an @entity1 shirt and you never want to accept that , particularly at home , ' the @entity64 flanker said			1
' but the fact we have lost by two really close margins in two really competitive games against the two best teams in the world does n't mean it 's back to the drawing board and that everyone is on suicide watch			2
' we have to keep our heads high and keep believing in what we are trying to implement			0
' we understand we will come under a lot of pressure now			0
the heat is going to come on from the rugby media and the rugby public			0
@entity1 captain @entity87 stands dejected after his team fifth successive this year ' everyone now relates everything to the @entity15 , but all we can do is stay tight as a group and keep plugging on			1
' @entity10 already planned to make changes against @entity45 on saturday , but there are now worrying levels of uncertainty in multiple positions with not a single player in the back line guaranteed their @entity15 spot			1
half - backs @entity50 and @entity52 were poor once again and will surely make way for @entity102 and @entity54 , while number eight @entity55 and @entity0 himself are likely to be missing from the team announced on wednesday			2
apart from making those adjustments on form , @entity105 is also ready to freshen up his matchday 23 as he explores other options and combinations			0
only success against @entity45 and @entity46 will salvage a modicum of respectability from the autumn , but first @entity1 must address evidence that they have regressed since the first half of june 's second test against @entity6 in @entity118			1
having drawn level at 20 - 20 with stirring forward - generated tries by @entity121 and @entity122 , they allowed @entity5 to pull clear with a touchdown by @entity124 and a penalty and drop - goal from @entity127			2
@entity128 crossed in the right corner with a minute left , but the match had already been decided as the @entity5 stretched their unbeaten run against @entity1 to 12 tests dating back to 2006			1
@entity10 is now facing the strongest criticism of his 32 - @entity32 reign as head coach ' we have n't had the real clarity and composure we needed at certain times			1
that 's what we 're not doing at the moment , ' @entity0 said			2
' the @entity17 and the @entity57 come with big reputations and our forward pack has rolled them at times , but we need to put ourselves in the right area of the field			0
' at certain times they have turned the heat up on us and unfortunately we have been found wanting			0
' an inexplicably looped pass from @entity50 to @entity150 was intercepted by centre @entity48 for a gift - wrapped score that helped @entity5 into an early 10 - 0 lead			1
' it 's all very well having the ball but if you are not going anywhere with it and if you are just in the midfield you are playing into their hands			2
it was another harsh lesson , ' @entity0 said			0
' we gave them an intercept try which in a three - point game is pretty criminal			0
i do n't hold @entity50 accountable for that at all			0
we were just meandering in midfield			0
we shot ourselves in the foot with that one			0
' when you have got an angry , hurt @entity57 team , really a smart move would not be giving them targets to hit early on			0
' but we just presented them targets to hit and that is their bread and butter			0
we 're pretty frustrated and disappointed			0

@entity1 's 31 - 28 loss to @entity5 was fifth defeat in succession
head coach @entity10 has presided over just two victories in 13 meetings against the @entity37 heavyweights
@entity1 have just 10 games remaining before next year 's @entity15
