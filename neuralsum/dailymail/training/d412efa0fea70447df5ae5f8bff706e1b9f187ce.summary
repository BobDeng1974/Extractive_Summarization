by @entity1 reporter published : 07:35 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 08:13 est , 22 march 2013 hunger strike : @entity3 is accused of strangling and beating to death his 91 - year - old wife , @entity5 , in 2011			1
he also claims to be a former general in the @entity8 army the trial of a @entity11 expat accused of killing his much - older socialite wife has ground to a standstill after he went on hunger strike in his mental asylum cell blaming @entity17 hitmen for her murder			1
it 's the latest twist in the case against @entity3 , a @entity11 expatriate whose behavior has ranged from odd to obstructive since he was charged with strangling and beating to death his 91 - year - old wife , @entity5			1
@entity3 , nearly a half - century younger than his late wife , has argued unsuccessfully for the right to wear what he said was an @entity8 military uniform in court			1
he fired his public defenders - only to have them reappointed after he was deemed too physically weak to act as his own lawyer			0
he told the judge he 'd follow his own rules and he 's name - dropped @entity33 , @entity35 and others in court proceedings			2
@entity3 's self - starving prompted a judge to indefinitely postpone the trial , scheduled to start this monday , after a doctor said @entity3 was too weak to be brought to court and prosecutors and defense lawyers said it was n't feasible for him to participate remotely from his hospital bed			1
his starvation , which he claims is for religious reasons , has been the biggest roadblock yet in the strange case that 's included his claims that he was a general in the @entity8 army and that the killing was an @entity17 hit job			1
@entity3 began fasting after he was ruled competent to stand trial in december			2
frustrated prosecutors say @entity3 , 48 , is orchestrating his own unavailability and thwarting their efforts to hold him accountable in the august 2011 slaying , and an exasperated judge says the case was in ' limbo status ' until at least next month			1
@entity3 's behavior has defied an easy solution : his presence in the courtroom could harm his health and disrupt the proceedings , but his absence could set up an appeal on grounds that the trial was improperly held			2
the parties are right to proceed cautiously since a trial without the defendant is an option ' reserved for the most bizarre , unheard of collection of circumstances that essentially result in a perfect storm , ' said @entity80 , a @entity81 criminal defense lawyer not involved in the case			2
' when a defendant 's not there , it 's just a hornet 's nest for the judge , ' he said , adding that a hastily made decision could raise all sorts of bases for an appeal			0
other options have been debated			0
prosecutor @entity94 suggested at one point that he might seek a court order to force - feed the defendant , but he 's acknowledged that that @entity3 - who 's been hospitalized for two months - might be too ill for that			1
killed : @entity5 was found dead , stabbed and beaten , at her home in @entity81 superior court judge @entity100 also considered having @entity3 appear via video link			1
but @entity94 argued that @entity3 could ' very well die on camera , on a two - way video feed ' before the jury			0
he said he saw no way for the trial to proceed as scheduled			0
' it 's not an approach that the government is comfortable risking a trial , a criminal conviction and a possible reversal on , ' @entity94 said			0
the investigation began after @entity3 reported finding 91 - year - old @entity5 's beaten and stabbed body in the bathroom of the couple 's row home in chic @entity118 , where for years they hosted dinner parties for notable @entity121			1
police arrested @entity3 , who has maintained his innocence , after finding no signs of forced entry to the home and observing scratches on his body that suggested a physical struggle			2
chic home : the investigation began after @entity3 reported finding 91 - year - old @entity5 's beaten and stabbed body in the bathroom of the couple 's home in chic @entity118 , where for years they hosted dinner parties for notable @entity121 he also aroused suspicion when he presented a document - which prosecutors say was forged - stating that he was entitled to a portion of her estate upon her death			1
in truth , he had been removed from her will , authorities say			0
@entity5 , who contributed columns to the @entity148 and wrote on @entity11 affairs , wed @entity3 in 1990			1
the couple 's tumultuous relationship included his prior conviction for beating her , and prosecutors say he leeched onto @entity5 's social connections to pass them off as his own			2
he walked the neighborhood smoking cigars and sporting a military - style uniform that prosecutors say was actually made for him in @entity158			0
he showed off a military certificate that came from a @entity161 print shop			0
important voice : @entity5 , who contributed columns to the @entity148 and wrote on @entity11 affairs , wed @entity3 in 1990 despite his grandiose claims , he lived off a monthly allowance from @entity5 , had no connection to the @entity8 army or any income of his own , prosecutors say			1
though defendants are entitled to attend every step of their trial , courts in recent years have grappled with where to draw the line on intentionally disruptive behavior			0
in @entity3 's case , a judge has scheduled a hearing for april			2
it 's not clear whether anything will be different			0
@entity3 has dropped about 30 pounds in the hospital since his fast began and his organs are failing , said dr. @entity185			0
he did eat and drink last weekend - and has consumed food intermittently in the last few weeks - but then chastised himself for disobeying the orders of the archangel @entity189 and pledged to begin his fast anew			0
he 's shown no signs he intends to permanently resume eating , telling @entity192 last week that if forced to choose between a jury of ' secular - ites ' and his own religious convictions , it was an easy decision : ' i opt for @entity198			0

@entity3 accused of murdering @entity5 in @entity81 home in 2011
