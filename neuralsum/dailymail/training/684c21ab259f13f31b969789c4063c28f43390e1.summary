by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 - the identical triplets who have beaten medical odds and are now a picture of health			1
the sisters were born premature in april at just 28 weeks and spent seven weeks in hospital , but are now home with their parents @entity11 and @entity13 from @entity14 , @entity15			1
the odds of having triplets are around 4,000 to one - with around one in six of all sets of triplets being identical			1
but the @entity14 trio are all thriving and become the fifth generation of their family , welcomed by great great grandmother @entity37 , 96			1
proud mum @entity11 , 25 , a youth support worker , said , ' it was overwhelming at first , when we found out			1
the initial scans were not very good and we were warned that i could miscarry at any time			2
' we were stressed , and incredibly upset but we kept going			2
five generations of women : the triplets with mum @entity11 and ( left to right ) grandmother @entity47 , 52 , great grandmother @entity48 , 74 , and great great grandmother @entity37 ' i had a steroid injection the week before they were born , and i am sure that meant they were stronger - they did n’t even need a ventilator			1
' looking at what we have now is incredible			0
they ’re three little miracles			0
' @entity58 , also 25 , a teaching assistant at @entity59 , in @entity60 , said , ' it was emotionally draining , the constant worry and the trips for scans and specialists			0
we ’ve had wonderful support from our family , friends , and at work , and the girls are worth all of the drama			0
sometimes we find ourselves just standing and staring at them			0
' the pair met at @entity75 in @entity14 and , at 15 , fell in love			1
they went on to do the same course at @entity79 before marrying , and then finding out they were expecting triplets			2
@entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 ( left to right ) wo n't be dressed in matching clothes to help then from their own identities @entity11 and @entity58 feed two at a time while rocking number three in the bouncer whilst she waits her turn while the new family is loving life at home , there are a few practical issues			1
' we had to buy a new car , and i only got a new one last september , ' said @entity11			1
' we ’ve got a three - seater pram and it wo n’t fit in , so that goes on the roof rack			0
' but everything at @entity100 ’s is three - for - two , so that ’s a bonus ! ' @entity58 continued , ' we manage to feed two at a time , and we ’re rocking the bouncer chair with our feet while the other one waits for a bottle			0
@entity1 at @entity107 when she was first born at just 28 weeks lily in an incubator at the hospital a newborn @entity3 hooked up to a ventilator to keep her tiny body alive ' when we ’re having tea , we ’ve got our plates on our knee and trying to keep them amused			1
' if one starts crying , it can set the others off , so we end up walking around the house on tip - toes			0
but they sleep quite well , and we are loving it			0
' but one thing @entity58 and @entity11 wo n’t be doing is buying them matching outfits			2
@entity11 said : ' we want them to be individuals			2
obviously , they ’re going to have an incredible bond , and that ’s something we ’re very excited about			0
but we ’ll be teaching them to be their own people			0
' there are five generations of @entity11 ’s family - from the triplets , to grandmother @entity47 , 52 , nana @entity48 , 74 , and great grandmother @entity37 - who becomes great great grandmother			1

they are absolutely beautiful , i am overjoyed			0
' the triplets ’ nana , @entity141 , said : ' i am just so proud of them			2
it was terrifying when we had to go for appointments , and up to the hospital in @entity148			0
' it ’s hard to believe just how perfect they are			0
' @entity151 and @entity58 with @entity2 and @entity3 @entity58 and @entity11 with the triplets who are now home and thriving , despite the odds			1
