by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 18:08 est , 30 april 2013 six out of ten people are worried about spiralling energy bills , far eclipsing the number concerned about climate change			1
despite ministers ’ efforts to convince the public of the need for costly ‘ green ’ energy projects , just one person in 20 said climate change was @entity14 ’s biggest challenge			1
when asked to rate the relative importance of ten issues , climate change was picked by just 5 per cent of those asked in the @entity20 survey			1
the quarterly survey by the @entity22 reveals growing anxiety about energy bills in the last year gas and electricity bills are more than 7 per cent higher than a year ago , but the government claimed that the public was most concerned about climate change unemployment was top of the list , at 37 per cent , followed by the @entity33 , inflation and rising prices , law and order , education , tax , energy supply , climate change and national security			1
only 17 per cent put climate change in their top three challenges , according to interviews with 2,500 people by the @entity48			2
rising energy bills , however , were very much on people ’s minds , with 23 per cent saying they were ‘ very concerned ’ and another 37 per cent ‘ fairly concerned ’ , higher than in the previous four surveys			2
some 43 per cent believed energy prices had risen more than shopping or transport costs , despite a rise in numbers of those who had switched suppliers to get a better deal			0
the survey revealed only five per cent of people thought climate change was the top challenge facing the @entity14 more people were aware of ‘ collective switching ’ – in which people club together to obtain a better deal – but two - thirds were ‘ not interested ’ in it			1
energy secretary @entity73 said it ' comes as no surprise ' that people are worried about bills despite the figures , energy secretary @entity73 said : ‘ the findings show energy and climate change issues are at the forefront of people ’s minds			1
‘ it comes as no surprise that energy bills are a concern , but the increase in collective switching awareness , as more and more people club together to increase their energy buying power , is encouraging			2
’ he said it also showed ‘ clear public support for the government to continue in its efforts of developing for low - carbon , home - grown forms of energy ’			0
the number of people who said they supported renewable energy rose to 82 per cent , 3 per cent up on a year ago			0
solar panels were one of the most popular and onshore wind power one of the least			0
last year , all of the @entity108 energy firms introduced inflation - busting rises of up to 11 per cent , raising the average dual fuel bill to over £ 1,300			0
the independent @entity111 predicts they will rise by another 7 per cent this year – another £ 100			0
climate change policies currently make up £ 112 , or nine per cent , of the average household energy bill , and this will rise to £ 286 by 2020 according to the government ’s figures			2
that will mean that 25p in every £ 1 spent on electricity will go on wind , solar , nuclear or home insulation schemes .			0

*60* ****%**** are worried about *paying* energy bills , up from *44* ****%**** in *december*
just 5 ****%**** said climate change was the top challenge facing the @entity14
30 ****%**** are anxious about *meeting* *mortgage* or rent *payments*
