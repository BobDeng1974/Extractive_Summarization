researchers have discovered that although many women assume they know exactly what turns them on , their brains and their lady bits often disagree			0
scientists at @entity7 's @entity6 in @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 , used a ' vaginal photoplethysmograph ' - a small glass tampon - shaped instrument that measures sexual arousal by blood flow - to demonstrate this mind - body disconnect			1
writer @entity17 , 33 , based in @entity18 , underwent the test herself and discovered some surprising discrepancies between what she believed she found sexy , and what her nether regions responded to			1
are we kidding ourselves ? the @entity6 used a ' glass , tampon - shaped ' probe that measures sexual arousal , and found discrepancies between what women think turns them on , and what actually does ' i 've always thought of myself as self - aware sexually , ' miss @entity17 writes for @entity33			1
' i consider myself a non-judgmental heterosexual woman who enjoys various positions and toys and is open to the possibility of a threesome if the urge strikes			0
' in the interests of the experiment , miss @entity17 was required to insert the probe into her vagina and seat herself on a leather chair while various erotic and non-erotic video clips were played before her			1
@entity49 , phd - whose work in sexual pleasure has reportedly earned him the monkier dr. @entity51 - and evolutionary biologist @entity54 , phd , both leading the study , were controlling the videos from a separate room			2
' the probe looked and felt like a glass tampon , so it was easy to forget that it was inside me , ' miss @entity17 tells @entity61			1
the device , she explains , measures blood flow to the surrounding tissue , or the ' pulse ' of the vagina , which indicates arousal			2
' it was definitely a challenge to stay still , but overall i was comfortable			0
since i was focused on watching porn , any discomfort i might have felt was probably eclipsed by the graphic imagery inches from my face			0
' quite the experience : writer @entity17 ( right ) underwent the test , and although she assumed that footage of a threesome would turn her on and bondage would not , her nether regions responded in the opposite fashion			1
pictured ( left ) @entity49 , phd , who conducted the study as dr @entity49 explains , arousal is made up from a balance between two brain systems ; sexual excitation , ' your gas pedal ' , and sexual inhibition , ' your breaks '			2
miss @entity17 was exposed to wide range of visual stimuli ; from ' neutralizing ' kitten videos and scenes from uplifting films , to hard - core porn and a disturbing clip from @entity98			1
for each video , she was asked to rate her emotional responses - excitement , relaxation , fright , sadness , guilt and shame , for example - on a five - point scale			0
miss @entity17 then told researchers , off the top of her head , that she was generally aroused by concepts including lesbian sex , a threesome and female masturbation			1
she also declared some concepts that she did n't consider arousing ; homosexual male sex , foot fetishism and bonobo monkeys mating , for example			2
after sourcing video clips relevant to miss @entity17 's preferences , she was invited to view them and rate how aroused each clip made her feel on a scale of one to ten			1
this created some mental conflicts			0
' as a proponent of gay rights , for instance , i wanted to be turned on by sex between men , but i found the sight of two erect penises off - putting			2
' and as much as i wanted to believe that neither animals nor feet could excite me , i had to concede a minimal level of attraction to both			0
' the lab : miss @entity17 was required to insert the vaginal probe ( right ) and recline on a leather chair ( left ) where she was exposed to a wide variety of visual stimuli via video a few days later , the results were in , and the researchers told miss @entity17 that her ' vaginal pulse ' was strongest when she watched lesbian sex , bondage , foot fetishism , and female masturbation			1
this was contradictory to how she recorded feeling at the time , when she said the bondage footage had turned her off			2
according to the probe 's results , miss @entity17 was least turned on while watching the bonobos clip - as expected - but also the threesome footage , which she had rated as turning her on to a degree of seven out of ten			1
a vaginal photoplethysmograph is a small glass tampon - shaped instrument that measures blood flow to the surrounding tissue			1
using this data , the probe determines the ' pulse ' of the vagina , which indicates sexual arousal			1
this was ' alarming ' she notes			0
in regards to the bondage footage , which she had claimed did n't arouse her but according to the probe , did , she writes : ' perhaps i 've been conditioned to associate domination by a man as anti-feminist , so my conscious mind could n't embrace @entity183 as eagerly as my vagina			2
' our guilt , shame , and social pressures can interrupt our ability to decipher our real sexual desires			0
' another surprising finding was that miss @entity17 had a stronger sexual response to the clip from @entity98 than she did when watching rom - com footage			1
this is not uncommon , according to dr @entity49			0
miss @entity17 notes that watching scary movies does make her crave ' cuddling and protection ' from her boyfriend			1
a few weeks later , she and her boyfriend watched a thriller together and sure enough , ' it did the trick			0
' in summary , miss @entity17 remarks , her adventure with the ' magical glass tampon ' opened up her mind and led her to challenge previous assumptions she had regarding her turn - ons			1
' i was surprised to learn that it 's important to pay equal attention to what turns you off as what turns you on , ' she tells @entity61			0
' people tend to think about arousal as purely a matter of what excites them , but sexual inhibitors are just as relevant as excitation factors			2
' she adds : ' i learned that it can take a lot of introspection and experimentation to figure these out , even for those of us who consider ourselves open - minded from a sexual standpoint			0
' this particular experiment was conducted only on women , so we can only guess to what degree men might be subconsciously repressing or openly embracing their sexual preferences			0
miss @entity17 doubts that gender is a factor			2
' i think it 's time to debunk the popular narrative that men are naturally more sexual than women , ' she says			0
' and i do n't imagine that women are more likely to repress their turn - ons			0
' i think sexual tastes depend less upon our biologically assigned gender and more upon who we are as individuals			0

the @entity6 in @entity247 used a ' glass , tampon - shaped ' probe that measures sexual arousal
writer @entity17 underwent the test , and found that contrary to her expectations , footage of foot fetishism turned her on
threesomes did not *trigger* a strong response , despite miss @entity17 liking the idea of having one
scenes from *horror* flick @entity98 *physically* aroused her more than clips from rom - coms
