the 20 - year - old coed was last seen with @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 on june 3 , 2011 near the campus of @entity7 in @entity17 , where all four were students			1
the three men say she left them to walk back to her own apartment and was never seen again			2
however , @entity25 's parents , @entity22 and @entity23 , claim the men are withholding information from detectives and know more about their daughter 's case than they are willing to admit			1
search : @entity5 , 20 , vanished two years and a half ago after a night out with friends			2
her parents are now suing the two men who saw her before she went missing in a bid to find out the truth , they say desperate : @entity22 and @entity23 said they do not believe the men have told everything they know the @entity42 filed a lawsuit in federal court in june , arguing that mr @entity13 and mr @entity14 - the last two to see her alive - had a ' duty of care ' to ensure their daughter 's safety			1
in december , a judge threw out the suit against mr @entity51 - agreeing with his attorneys who said he could not be held liable simply because he was with her when she was intoxicated the night she vanished			0
attorneys for mr @entity13 and mr @entity14 have responded			1
they deny that they know anything more about @entity23 's disappearance than what they have already told police			0
and they say that they did n't have a ' duty of care ' - or a responsibility to look after the intoxicated @entity23			0
the @entity42 are not suing @entity67 's @entity66 , which is accused of continuing the serve the intoxicated underage student and her friends			1
@entity70 admitted that the move seemed extreme , but added to @entity72 : ' any parent in search of information about a missing child would use every resource available to them			0
' therefore , we intend to use the rights afforded by the civil justice system to obtain answers to questions that have gone unanswered for too long			0
we fully expect that those with relevant information will cooperate with this process			0
' in an interview last month , the couple said they did not believe the men were telling the truth about their daughter 's last hours and they are uncertain if she even left their apartment , as they have said she did			1
the couple say they still believe someone will eventually reveal what happened to her and that it would be devastating to never find their daughter even though they assume she is dead			0
questions : @entity14 , left , and @entity13 , right , saw @entity5 the night she vanished the @entity42 have maintained since soon after @entity25 vanished in the early hours of june 3 , 2011 , in downtown @entity17 that several of the people who were with her that night have n't fully cooperated with police			1
' there 's a sense that someday , some week things will change for us			0
that someone will have the strength , the crisis of conscience to come forward , ' @entity111 has told @entity116			0
@entity25 went to @entity14 's apartment with a friend on the night she vanished			1
she then left with @entity13 and went to a bar - even though she was not old enough to drink			1

it should have taken her just six minutes to return home , but she has not been seen since			0
the three young men have previously said that the @entity42 are harassing them for information about their daughter 's whereabouts			1
' we ’ve done nothing wrong			0
if we 'd done something wrong , we would have been arrested already			0
all they ’re doing is hurting my career , ' said @entity13			2
desperate search : @entity23 , left , has kept the pressure on in the hunt for her missing daughter @entity25 ' it ’s inappropriate the way they ’re harassing people that are also victims in this case , ' he told the @entity169			0
@entity13 told the paper that he has had to field phone calls from reporters , the @entity23 's lawyers , and the @entity42 themselves , though the parents deny that they ever called the young men			1
' @entity177 and i have never spoken to @entity13 , ' @entity25 's mother @entity176 said to the paper			2
' the private investigators have never spoken to @entity13			2
