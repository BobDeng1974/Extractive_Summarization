by @entity0 published : 03:36 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 3 may 2013 the first @entity3 squadron combining the use of combat helicopters with unmanned drones is ' the future of warfare ' , officials have said			1
the aircraft will be operated by a squadron of 140 sailors - called the ' @entity12 ' - who will work off coastal combat ships that are smaller and faster than destroyers and aircraft carriers			1
the @entity18 drone - which can be controlled by a pilot up to 110 miles away and can remain in the air for at least eight hours - will be for surveillance and target acquisition			1
first : the first @entity3 helicopter squadron to include unmanned aircraft was unveiled in @entity25 yesterday ' @entity12 ' : the squadron of sailors will control the unmanned aircraft from distances of up to 110 miles away unmanned drones can also be loaded with missiles to carry out targeted strikes			1
military use of potentially lethal drones has been a source of much controversy , with anti-war campaigners calling for an outright ban			2
a draft report for the @entity39 this week called for a moratorium on the use of ' lethal autonomous robotics ' , until an international conference can develop rules for their use			0
admiral @entity46 said at a ceremony to introduce the new @entity3 squadron in @entity25 yesterday : ' we 've been using multi-million dollar destroyers to chase @entity52 pirates			2
' this approach is designed for near - shore environment where our current experience shows us we 're most likely to encounter threats			0
' chopper : members of the new squadron pose with one of the unmanned @entity61 , which look and launch like a helicopter the new approach combines @entity66 helicopters the @entity3 currently uses with the @entity18 , a @entity68 - built drone that looks and launches like a helicopter			1
where the helicopters are designed and built for antisubmarine and surface warfare , as well as search and rescue , the @entity18 will be equipped and used for surveillance , target acquisition and relaying information to its controllers , at least for now			1
the unmanned aircraft is controlled by two ' pilots ' on the ground or on a ship up to 110 miles away			1
it can stay in the air for at least eight hours , compared to the helicopter 's maximum air time of 3.3 hours			0
unmanned : a @entity88 unmanned helicopter stands in between two @entity90 - r aircraft at the base in the @entity92 dedication : @entity3 officers bow their heads in prayer at the ceremony held at @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity25 , yesterday ' @entity12 ' : the @entity100 35 , named the ' @entity12 ' , will fly @entity101 as well as the @entity102 , seen here the @entity3 has been testing the @entity18 since 2007 and deploying it since 2009 , using it for counter-narcotics operations and in @entity104			1
in 2012 , two of the drones crashed in separate incidents , and the @entity3 briefly grounded its @entity18 fleet			1
another was shot down over @entity110 in 2012			0
the strengths of the @entity18 lie in how long it can monitor situations , @entity46 told a news conference			0
' helicopters ca n't stay airborne as long as the @entity18 , ' he said			0
' with the @entity18 's endurance of up to eight hours , the helicopter crew can return refuel , rearm and re-man while the @entity18 maintains contact			0
' @entity46 acknowledged that the @entity3 does n't have a playbook for how to mix manned and unmanned flying warfare			2
' the ink has not dried on any set of criteria yet , ' he said			0
' as with any new systems and any new technology , we work through the bugs from early on			0
' manufacturer @entity68 is looking forward to seeing how the @entity3 actually uses the @entity18 and already has an upgraded version in the pipeline , according to @entity132 , sector vice president of global logistics and operational support			2
' we put it in the hands of these smart , young sailors and they figure out ways to operate it that we never thought of , ' mr @entity132 said			2
' they take some little thing we barely noticed and do something amazing with it while something we paid a lot of attention to , they 'll barely notice or use at all			0
