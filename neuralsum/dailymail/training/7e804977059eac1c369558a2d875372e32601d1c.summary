@entity12 energy firms have robbed the average family of £ 145 over the past year by failing to pass on a sharp fall in wholesale prices , it has been claimed ' we found that the failure of retail prices to align with wholesale costs has cost consumers £ 2.9billion over the last year , an equivalent of £ 145 per household on standard tariffs			1
