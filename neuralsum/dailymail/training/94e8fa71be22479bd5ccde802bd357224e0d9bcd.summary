@entity0 has wasted no time in revolutionising @entity1 on his arrival at @entity3			1
the @entity4 has bought exciting new additions to the fold in @entity7 and @entity8 , with more new faces in the pipeline			0
the squad will have a very different feel to it regardless of signings , though , as @entity14 is just as intent on clearing out the deadwood			2
watch scroll down for ' @entity1 misfits @entity16 and @entity17 practice their accuracy ' click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week … meet the new boss : @entity0 will be shipping out some familiar faces in his @entity3 revolution during the club 's successful pre-season tour , the new manager admitted there would be several casualties of his squad revamp			1
he said : ' i shall make judgements after this tour			0
' i have let all the players play and i know now more than before the tour			0
' now also it is a little bit soon to judge but in football you have to judge			0
you have to give the player a chance to make a transfer when i see that his prospects to play are not so high			0
' you have to say it in advance because it ’s too late after august 31			0
i will tell payers after the tour			0
' here , @entity53 assesses who will be cast aside in the new @entity1 , and which clubs will be able to pick up the pieces			1
@entity16 the @entity57 was @entity1 's sole signing last summer , and his mediocre performances in the middle of the park became synonymous with @entity63 ' dismal reign			1
how much : @entity1 expect to take a hit on the £ 27.5million they paid and want £ 20million but will do well to get £ 15million			1
who 's interested : @entity67 but not at the asking price			0
a subsidised loan suits them but they are already weighing up alternatives			0
flop : @entity16 became synonymous with @entity63 ' disastrous reign at @entity3 @entity74 ' @entity74 ' has an impressive goals to games ratio in a @entity1 shirt , but his detractors suggest he needs more to his game			1
he 's well behind the likes of @entity81 and @entity82 in the pecking order and will find more opportunities elsewhere			0
how much : £ 12million would be the @entity86 's price ideal but @entity1 expect closer to £ 10million			1
who 's interested : @entity88 and @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 are just some of the clubs to have expressed an interest			1
poacher : but @entity74 , battling against @entity96 , could be surplus to requirements @entity99 the @entity100 has failed to live up to his reputation , with a torrid spell at @entity3 rife with injury			1
with no pre-season form behind him , by now he is well down the list of @entity0 's midfielders			1
how much : @entity1 are struggling to find takers even at a knockdown £ 5million			1
who 's interested : clubs in @entity112 and @entity113 have shown interest but little else			0
his displays on loan at @entity119 did little to impress			0
@entity99 may be difficult to shift			1
dead wood : @entity1 are facing trouble in getting rid of out - of - favour midfielder @entity99 @entity17 the mercurial winger has had a career of ups and downs at @entity3 , but it may finally be time to move on			1
his frustratingly inconsistent displays , along with a incompatibility with @entity14 's wing - backs system means his @entity1 number is up			1
how much : a new five year deal raised his value last season but price will be around £ 12million to £ 15million			0
who 's interested : @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity135 and @entity136 still rate the @entity100 winger despite his inconsistency			1
best foot forward : mercurial winger @entity17 , in action in pre-season , could be heading for the @entity3 exit @entity143 sir @entity144 bought the hotly - tipped @entity146 playmaker in from @entity147 to revolutionise the @entity149 ' attacking threat			1
although he has impressed in spells , injuries and the arrival of @entity153 means @entity143 may have to look elsewhere for regular action			2
how much : @entity1 will look to get around £ 8million to £ 10million for the @entity146 playmaker			2
who 's interested : @entity147 coach @entity157 loves @entity143			2
@entity90 are interested too in a player who has looked resigned to leaving			0
plenty interested in a loan			0
return of the prodigal son ? @entity143 could be in line for a return to @entity147 @entity164 the winger was tipped as an @entity168 @entity167 star on his arrival from @entity170 , but has failed to live up to the hype			2
farmed out on loan to @entity173 last season and another who does n't benefit from a wing - backs formation , his move to @entity1 may have been one gamble too far			2
how much : @entity1 would do well to raise £ 10million and may prefer to send him out on loan and see if his value rises again			2
who 's interested : @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity170 and @entity185 would all take a chance on a player who has yet to show his potential			0
@entity189 : @entity164 has not lived up to his billing since joining @entity1 and could be on his way			2

@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity143 among those on the way out
new manager @entity0 will carry on revolutionising the squad
@entity74 *attracting* interest from @entity88 and @entity91
@entity1 having trouble *offloading* the likes of @entity99
