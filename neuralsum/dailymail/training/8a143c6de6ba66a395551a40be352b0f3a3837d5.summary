an @entity2 chemical weapons expert who the @entity3 feared was ' gathering equipment ' for the militants has been killed in an airstrike in @entity8 , officials have claimed			1
@entity9 was killed on january 24 near @entity10 , after being ' specifically targeted ' by the @entity3 - led forces because of growing concern @entity2 may be trying to secure chemical weapons			1
@entity9 had worked at @entity16 's @entity15 chemical weapon production facility - a factory to the north - west of @entity19 known for producing lethal sarin gas			1
the factory - which still housed the remnants of about 2,500 rockets filled with sarin and other deadly nerve agents - was seized by @entity2 - led @entity27 rebels in june last year			1
however , a statement from the @entity39 and @entity3 said the weapons would have degraded too much to be any use to the extremist group			0
an official , speaking under condition of anonymity , told the @entity47 coalition members had become increasingly concerned about the extremist group 's efforts to acquire chemical weapons			2
he was thought to be capable of creating harmful and deadly chemical agents - although there is no evidence @entity2 has an arsenal of chemical weapons			1
but it is believed to be attempting to pursue a chemical weapons capability			1
another source told the @entity59 : ' he was gathering a lot of equipment — we 're not really sure for what — before we killed him			2
' but it 's concerning that someone who was fairly seriously high up in the [ chemical weapons ] infrastructure linked up with [ @entity2 ]			1
this was n't some enlisted guy			0
' captured : the factory - which still contains 2,500 rockets filled with gas - was taken over by @entity2 militants last summer , about the same time @entity9 is thought to have joined the group fears : an anonymous source claims the @entity3 was worried @entity9 was ' gathering equipment ' which could be used to up @entity2 's chemical weapons capability @entity9 , who is understood to have defected to @entity79 in 2005 , before changing his allegiance to @entity2 more recently , is the first of the 8,000 militants killed since airstrikes began in august to be named by the @entity3			1
it is thought a number of his associates had already been rounded up by @entity8 troops			0
a statement from @entity89 said : ' his death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish @entity2 's ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people			1
' @entity2 is another term for @entity2			0
@entity96 , just 45 miles from @entity19 , was once one of @entity8 's biggest producers of the deadly sarin gas			1
the complex is thought to have been capable of producing around 4,000 tones of nerve agent a year			0
the factory began producing mustard gas in 1980 , but did n't begin producing significant amounts until a couple of years later			0
it moved onto nerve gasses in 1984 - including sarin , which it used to deadly effect in the 1980s and early 1990s			0
sarin gas - which was outlawed in 1993 - is lethal even in small doses , taking one to 10 minutes to kill a person after they inhale the deadly nerve agent if an antidote is administered			2
if it is drunk , the victim can survive for up to 18 hours			0
it is one of the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents , according to the @entity121			0
exposure to the gas causes pupils to shrink to pinpoint sizes and foaming at the lips , while symptoms include paralysis , loss of consciousness and respiratory failure			0
the site was bombed by the @entity3 during the @entity134 , but the munitions there were only partially destroyed , according to the @entity39 - then left to @entity8 to take care of			2
but the last major report by @entity39 inspectors after the fall of @entity16 revealed @entity141 13 still contained 2,500 sarin - filled 122 - mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991 , and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide , ' a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun '			2
@entity2 fighters took over the factory on june 12 this year , in a dawn raid captured on cctv watched by security guards .			0
