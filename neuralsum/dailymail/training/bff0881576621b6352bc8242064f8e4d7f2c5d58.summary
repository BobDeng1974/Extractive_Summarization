a celebrity psychic has sacked her husband and son - in - law from their roles in her management team after they were filmed threatening and hurling homophobic abuse at a sceptic who was handing out leaflets outside her shows			1
@entity12 's husband , @entity13 , and son - in - law , @entity15 , were caught on camera by @entity17 as he stood outside a @entity19 theatre distributing leaflets that questioned whether psychics really could speak to the dead			1
mr @entity13 was shown approaching mr @entity17 , 30 , and threatening him with violence if he did not leave , saying : ' i 'm gon na knock you out sooner or later ... ' so f * * * off before i do you			1
she gave the news in a statement on her website , saying mr @entity13 and mr @entity15 will ' have nothing more to do with my business ' , and adding : ' right now i honestly have no idea what is going to happen to my marriage			2
' the video , which has just been released to coincide with october being ' @entity53 ' , was filmed outside the @entity54 in north @entity19 in april this year , shortly before mrs @entity12 gave one of her ' @entity56 : @entity57 ' shows			0
mr @entity17 , who was handing out leaflets entitled ' @entity59 ' to audience members attending in the hope the psychic might contact dead relatives , said he had a video camera because mr @entity13 had been ' threatening and abusive ' at the two previous shows he had leafleted			1
the footage shows the psychic 's husband coming up to him and telling him he was taking legal action against mr @entity17			2
when mr @entity17 refused to leave , saying he was doing nothing wrong , mr @entity13 launched into a tirade of abuse , saying : ' i 'm gon na knock you out one day because you are a nuisance ... the tape , which was uploaded to @entity76 , began showing mr @entity13 telling mr @entity17 he was suing him but the encounter quickly soured , with the psychic 's husband threatening mr @entity17 with physical violence as mr @entity13 continues to threaten mr @entity17 , he is joined by his son - in - law and mrs @entity12 's tour manager ' one day you 're gon na be lifted and you 'll disappear somewhere			1
' he went on : ' you 're a prat and i 'm losing my temper , because i 'm gon na knock you out sooner or later			2
' so f * * * off before i do you			0
' he is seen continuing in this vein , becoming increasingly agitated despite mr @entity17 's refusal to fight back , saying : ' i 'm gon na hit you in a minute			1
i 'm gon na knock you out			2
' at this point , @entity12 's son - in - law , then tour manager , mr @entity15 , approached and added : ' i 've seen him do it and you really do n't want him to do it			1
' mr @entity13 , who also threatened to ' flatten ' mr @entity17 , hurled homophobic abuse at him as well , saying : '' you 're a poof as well - we know all about your life			1
' he added : ' you know , you look pale			0
are you on drugs or has someone s * * * * * * you too much ? ' one of your boyfriends been * * * * * * * * * * ? ' mr @entity17 put his footage , which he says bears at 2012 date stamp because he used a ' cheap camera ' , on @entity76 , where it has had more than 120,000 views			0
' you look pale ' : the abuse becomes homophobic , as mr @entity17 is accused of sleeping with various men initially mrs @entity12 apologised for the remarks made on the tape , and in a statement she put out on friday accused mr @entity17 of ' persistent hounding ' , saying her husband had reacted ' angrily ' because of his ' ever - growing concern ' for her safety			1
however last night she published another statement , saying : ' i have come from a family background that has always been very accepting , many of my friends are gay and i have always felt happy that i am often referred to as a gay icon through my work			0
' i am utterly ashamed and devastated at the behaviour of my husband @entity129 and son - in - law @entity130 , and neither of them will have anything to do with my work , my business , and right now i honestly have no idea what is going to happen to my marriage			0
' enigmatically , the statement concluded : ' there will be many more important decisions being made over the course of this week			0
' mr @entity17 told @entity142 today that his leaflets were not specifically about @entity12 , saying : ' i just wanted those who were attending a psychic show to have all the information they needed to make an informed choice about whether psychics have real powers or whether they just appear to have them			2
' he added : ' from the very first time i was handing out leaflets on the street , @entity13 harassed and threatened me - telling me to " f * * * off before i floor you "			0
' not once did i ever approach him , and i would have preferred it if he had just left me alone			0
' mr @entity17 said mr @entity13 's behaviour was ' inexcusable ' , and said he was angry that mrs @entity12 had initially ' inferred what happened was justified because i was somehow " hounding " them			1
' he added : ' the reaction from @entity12 's team has been totally unjustified and threatened my right to free speech			0
' mrs @entity12 did not reply to @entity142 's requests for a comment .			0
