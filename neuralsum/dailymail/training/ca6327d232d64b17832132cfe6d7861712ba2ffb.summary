@entity6 , who set multiple records while passing for more than 300 yards and four touchdowns in the 28 - 24 win for @entity7 , was given a red 2015 @entity16 pickup truck as part of his mvp award			1
he was given a truck as part of the award the bill ( file photo right ) that @entity6 ( left ) receives will be just a fraction of his $ 17million salary for 2014 @entity28 ( right ) did n't win the @entity30 award , but he did get the truck that came with the honor the three - time @entity30 gave the truck to teammate @entity28 to show his appreciation for the play the defensive back made at the end of the game to help seal the win for @entity7			1
that gift will not go unpunished as the truck is considered a taxable prize under the @entity39 , section 74			0
not only will @entity6 , 37 , have to pay $ 13,500 in income tax for winning the truck , he will also have to pay a $ 8,000 gift tax on it			1
