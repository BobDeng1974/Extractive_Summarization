by @entity0 published : 16:50 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 11 december 2013 citing a potential threat to public health , the @entity1 is taking steps toward phasing out the use of some antibiotics in animals processed for meat in the @entity9 many cattle , hog and poultry producers give their animals antibiotics regularly to ensure that they are healthy and to make the animals grow faster			1
now , the agency has announced that it will ask pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily stop labeling drugs important for treating human infection as acceptable for that growth promotion in animals			1
this photo shows turkeys raised without the use of antibiotics at @entity24 's farm , in @entity25 , @entity26 if the companies sign on , and one major company has already said it will , using those antibiotics to promote growth in animals would be illegal			1
prescriptions would be required to use the drugs for animal illnesses			1
the @entity1 has been debating how to address the issue of antibiotics in meat for several years as consumers have become more aware of the issue and are clamoring for antibiotic - free meat			1
@entity40 's , among other companies , has moved to limit the drugs in their meat , pushing many animal producers to go along			1
the @entity1 move is designed to limit antibiotic - resistant diseases in humans			1
repeated exposure to antibiotics can lead germs to become resistant to the drug so that it is no longer effective in treating a particular illness			2
antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem			2
in september the @entity56 released sobering estimates that more than 23,000 people a year are dying from drug - resistant infections			2
the biggest risk is from germs spread in hospitals , and it 's not clear how much of the problem is related to the use of drugs in meat			1
still , the @entity1 says this is one step toward decreasing resistance			0
' we need to be selective about the drugs we use in animals and when we use them , ' said @entity73 of @entity1 's @entity74			1
@entity1 is taking steps toward phasing out the use of some antibiotics in animals processed for meat ' @entity81 resistance may not be completely preventable , but we need to do what we can to slow it down			2
' the new guidance will give the companies three years to comply			0
@entity86 , @entity1 's deputy commissioner of foods , said he believes asking industry to make the changes is the fastest way to help phase the drugs out			1
if the @entity1 made the process mandatory , he said , the agency would have had to move forward with a complex regulatory process that could take years			0
' we have high confidence based on dialogue with industry that this initiative will succeed , ' @entity86 said			0
drug company @entity100 , a leading manufacturer of animal antibiotics , has already said they will comply			2
' this reflects our continued commitment to antibiotic stewardship and represents the many ways that @entity100 promotes the responsible use of antimicrobial drugs in animals , ' the company 's statement said			1
animal agriculture groups will not have much of a choice in the matter if drug companies sign on and make the drugs ' use illegal			1
but many antibiotics will still be available for those producers to use , just not those that the @entity1 has classified as most important for treating human infections			0
some of the antibiotics that could not be used in animals are penicillins and tetracyclines , the @entity1 said			0
many animal groups signaled support for the @entity1 guidance after it was announced wednesday , including the @entity130			2
still , dr. @entity131 of the pork producers ' group said the @entity1 action will mean ' real change ' in the way antibiotics are used on the farm , as some animals may not grow as quickly and producers may see more disease			0
she said she does not know how much it will cost the industry			0
some advocates pushing to rid the animal food supply of antibiotics said the @entity1 did not go far enough			2
@entity148 rep. @entity147 of @entity149 , a microbiologist , said the @entity1 should have made the action mandatory			0
the guidance ' falls woefully short of what is needed to address a public health crisis , ' she said			0
others hailed the agency move as progress			0
' we commend @entity1 for taking the first steps since 1977 to broadly reduce antibiotic overuse in livestock , ' said @entity161 of the @entity164 ' human health and industrial farming campaign			0
' there is more work to do , but this is a promising start , especially after decades of inaction			0

@entity40 's has moved to limit the drugs in their meat
if it goes ahead , prescriptions would be required to use the drugs for animal illnesses
