by @entity0 genetically modified crops ' have a role to play ' in helping feed the world , the princess royal has said - putting her at stark odds with her older brother @entity7			1
her acceptance that the development of @entity11 crops is ' inevitable ' is staunchly opposite to the @entity12 who is on the @entity14 side of the debate			1
the @entity17 's daughter admits she seldom discusses the issue with the @entity12 , who once suggested the method risked creating ‘ the biggest disaster environmentally of all time ’			1
princess @entity22 said new methods are needed to ensure the world 's population is adequately fed , adding that those who are opposed to the idea have to accept @entity11 crops will be cultivated			1
princess @entity22 told @entity29 's @entity28 that @entity11 crops have a role to play in feeding the world , putting her at odds with her brother , the @entity12 who is @entity14 in an interview for the @entity29 's @entity28 programme she said : ‘ i think it ( @entity11 ) has a role to play , to be honest			1
' when asked what prince @entity7 thought of her viewpoint , she said it is natural for families to adopt differing opinions			0
she said : ‘ i do think there are some things which , even if you do n’t like the sound of it yourself , you know that it ’s got to a point where you ’re not going to stop it , because you ca n’t			0
’ appearing on the @entity29 show @entity22 also advocated gassing badgers as a ' much nicer way ' to control the @entity54 outbreak , than shooting			1
princess @entity22 ’s intervention came after environment secretary @entity57 refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls			1
an independent report found that the ‘ controlled shooting ’ used so far has not been an efficient or humane way to reduce the number of badgers in the @entity63			0
princess @entity22 said ‘ gas is a much nicer way of doing it , if that ’s not a silly expression ’			2
the princess royal made the comments in an interview to be broadcast on sunday on @entity29 in an extraordinary interview full of outspoken comments , princess @entity22 also suggested that eating horsemeat is ‘ worth looking at ’			1
she said she has tried eating it and found it tasted ‘ very good ’			0
in a series of discussions on countryside matters , @entity22 backed the recent pilot badger culls , one of which was carried out in @entity84 where she lives and farms			1
her remarks were met with fury from animal rights campaigners , who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane			1
an independent report published on thursday found that the badger cull in @entity93 and @entity84 had been marred by poor marksmanship			1
badgers had in some cases taken longer than five minutes to die and far too few animals were killed			0
controlled shooting - the shooting of free - running badgers - was not an efficient way of killing the animals , the report found			0
asked about alternatives to gunning them down , @entity22 said : ‘ most people will tell you that gas is a much nicer way of doing it , if that ’s not a silly expression , because of the way it works			2
‘ and how it works is that you go to sleep , basically			0
’ princess @entity22 's remarks have been met with fury from animal rights campaigners and zoologists , who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane ( file picture ) the royal ’s comments were condemned by animal campaigners and zoologists			1
professor @entity125 , senior research fellow at the @entity126 , said : ‘ gassing badgers was government policy in the 1970s , and reports of the time are full of frustration about how it just was n’t very effective			2
‘ sub-lethal concentrations of gas were inhumane			0
that ’s why gassing was banned by ministers in 1982			2
‘ the problem seemed to be that badger setts are built to hold warm air in and keep cold drafts out - so it was very difficult to achieve lethal concentrations of gas			0
’ princess @entity22 's comments about gassing badgers came after environment secretary @entity57 refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls she added : ‘ culling works against the grain of badger ecology and behaviour			1
‘ it ’s much more promising to explore the possibilities for vaccination , which could potentially exploit the same aspects of badger biology to improve the effectiveness of @entity54 control			2
’ @entity158 , of @entity159 , said : ‘ it is extremely disappointing that a prominent member of the royal family should endorse the gassing of a supposedly protected indigenous wild mammal			2
‘ gassing experiments carried out at @entity166 in the early 1980s were abandoned because of the appalling levels of suffering to which the badgers were exposed			0
‘ any attempt to reintroduce gassing would doubtless result in a slow and painful death for many badgers , and potentially other non-target animals			0
’ princess @entity22 has farmed at her @entity176 estate for nearly four decades , and bovine tb has wiped out a third of one herd in the past two years			2
but she added that the feared spread of @entity54 to cattle was not the only reason to cull badgers , which she said were getting out of control in some areas , causing problems for other species such as hedgehogs , bees and ground - nesting birds			2
the @entity17 ’s daughter said : ‘ even if you took the cattle completely out of this debate , from a conservation issue alone , you ’d have to say there are too many badgers			1
‘ a bigger growth in the badger population is not good for the balance of conservation anyway			1
’ @entity202 , a working vet and member of the @entity204 , said : ‘ research clearly shows that gassing badgers is even more inhumane than shooting and the @entity208 has shown that was bad enough			0
‘ @entity210 has clearly stated that gassing with cyanide should never again be considered and there are no alternate gases available without similar unacceptable effects			0
’ controlled @entity216 pilot culls last year marksmen shot at freely running badgers , aiming to cut numbers by 70 per cent			0
only 48 per cent were killed in @entity93 and 39 per cent in @entity84			1
up to 23 per cent took more than five minutes to die			0
@entity220 is to use bait to lure badgers into small cages before killing them with a shotgun			0
pilot culls were only meant to use traps as a last resort , but an independent review found contractors started using the method after just two days			0
gassingexperiments in the 1970s and 1980s found too many badgers were injured but not killed by cyanide gas , which critics said was cruel and painful			0
@entity237 rights campaigners argue a vaccination programme would be far more humane and effective			1
a scheme for a ‘ buffer zone ’ around the worst - affected areas was announced on thursday , but ministers say it is too late to vaccinate in high - risk areas .			2

princess royal said development of @entity11 crops is ' inevitable '
@entity12 claims they risk the ' biggest disaster environmentally '
@entity17 's daughter admits she seldom discusses the issue with her brother
she said gassing is a better way to control the badger population
@entity57 said cull in @entity93 and @entity84 will continue
but environment secretary cancels plan to extend cull to 10 areas
