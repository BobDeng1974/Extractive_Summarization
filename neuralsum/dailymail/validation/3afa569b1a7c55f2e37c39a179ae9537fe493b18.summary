need some inspiration deciding who to back at @entity2 ? @entity4 's @entity3 and @entity5 reveal their favourites while @entity8 presenter @entity7 and other celebrities have also shared their tips for the @entity2			1
@entity5 @entity11 ( @entity13 ’ @entity12 , 1.30 ) i can forgive him his fall on his last run at @entity18 — it was a typical novice mistake			1
but his form otherwise looks pretty strong and he can also boast some top quality @entity21 - winning hurdle form			2
he is taken to fend off the strong @entity24 threat led by @entity25 and @entity26			2
best odds : 7 - 2 @entity28 , pictured at the @entity29 at @entity18 , is @entity5 's tip for the @entity12 @entity31 ( @entity32 , 2.40 ) this gelding , trained by @entity34 ( below ) , looks a much more complete racehorse this season and has won all his four races since being beaten by @entity39 ’s @entity38 hope @entity40 at the @entity41 in april			1
he fell at this meeting last year but i would not hold that against him			2
plus trainer @entity34 already has a winner on the board with @entity48 on the first day			1
best odds : 3 - 1 @entity49 temps pour tout ( @entity52 , 3.20 ) an expensive recruit from @entity54 who has not yet quite reached the heights expected of him			2
he did , however , run a very promising first race of the season when third to thursday ’s opponent @entity58 in the @entity59 in january			1
that was his first run since may so he is entitled to improve significantly and play a big part in a very open race			0
confidence will be increased in his chance now that trainer @entity66 has had a winner at the meeting			0
best odds : 12 - 1 @entity69 ( @entity70 , 4.0 ) this @entity72 - trained eight - year - old was an easy five length winner at @entity74 on his last run and looks a horse who still has a little in hand with the handicapper			0
best odds : 7 - 1 @entity80 was an easy five length winner at @entity74 and looks to have a little in hand with the handicapper @entity84 @entity85 ( @entity86 , 2.05 ) @entity89 looks a good option here but , at even longer odds , this @entity88 - trained stayer looks worth a punt			0
he was fourth in the race 12 months ago , beaten less than half a length in a blanket finish , and he races off a marginally lower handicap mark this afternoon			0
his stable is in decent form with a couple of winners in its last six runners			0
best odds : 25 - 1 @entity105 ( @entity32 , 2.40 ) lacks a little match practice for such a hotly - contested event as this but there is no doubt the @entity112 - trained gelding possesses talent			1
he would probably have beaten @entity115 , a rival again on thursday , in the @entity116 at @entity117 last time but for an error at the final fence			1
best odds : 16 - 1 @entity120 ( @entity52 , 3.20 ) has failed to win since his first race of the season at @entity124 at the start of november and could be regarded as disappointing			1
but the positives are that his stable has emerged from a quiet spell and he has had a breathing operation since being beaten behind @entity131 here in january			0
will be staying on better than most at the finish			0
best odds : 16 - 1 @entity134 has failed to win since his first race of the season at @entity124 at the start of november @entity8 ' @entity8 presenter @entity7 is backing @entity58 and the celebs ... here 's who the celebs are backing in thursday ’s @entity52			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity7 - @entity141 presenter @entity143 it should be an open race this year but this is a horse that is well regarded			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity149 presenter @entity150 he is a better horse than last season and they will have learned a lot more how to ride him after his defeat last time out			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity158 - @entity149 presenter @entity160 i can see the race panning out perfectly for jockey @entity163			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity165 - @entity164 professional @entity150 i think he will win as he ’ll be ridden to pounce late			2
@entity168 pundit @entity160 you need a true stayer to win this race and he is definitely that			2
@entity176 correspondent @entity177 a useful horse who should run well at a decent price .			0
