by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 20:50 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 08:50 est , 4 april 2012 @entity3 last night stormed to a hat - trick of primary wins in @entity2 , @entity6 and the @entity7 , trouncing main rival @entity8 and all but securing the @entity12 nomination to face president @entity13 in november			1
it was one of his biggest nights in three months of voting in the roller - coaster @entity12 battle			1
@entity3 ’s resounding victory , following a string of big - name endorsements in the past week , means that he can now firmly lock his sights on @entity13			1
with 98 delegates at stake , the former @entity24 governor was on track to top 600 delegates , well over twice that of all his rivals combined			0
in his victory speech in @entity1 , @entity3 turned his fire on @entity13 , who earlier in the day had mentioned him by name publicly for the first time in recent months			1
returning the compliment , @entity3 used @entity13 ’s name 16 times and @entity8 ’s not once			1
@entity3 said : ' under this president 's watch , more @entity44 have lost their jobs than during any other period since the @entity49			1
millions have lost their homes , and a record number of @entity44 are living in poverty			0
' and the most vulnerable have been hurt the most - over 30 per cent of single moms are struggling in poverty			0
' new business start - ups are at the lowest level in 30 years , and our national debt is at a record high			0
and when you drive home tonight and stop at a gas station , just take a look at the prices and ask yourself , " four more years ? " ' @entity67 has already cut back his staff and curtailed his campaigning while @entity70 , the maverick @entity71 congressman , was intent on building his libertarian movement and not making a serious play to win primaries			0
even @entity8 has dampened down his anti-romney rhetoric in recent days			2
victorious : @entity3 greets the public during a campaign stop at a @entity80 fast food restaurant , in @entity81 , @entity2 @entity3 lambasted ' @entity13 ’s government - centred society ' , as a place where ' government spending will always increase because … there ’s no reason to stop it ' and ' there ’s always someone who is entitled to something more , and who will vote for anyone who will give them something more '			1
with the next primaries taking place on april 24 in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , @entity3 has three weeks in which @entity8 , a former @entity101 for @entity96 will be under fierce pressure to pull out			1
polls in @entity96 showed @entity3 closing the gap fast			2
defeat in his home state for @entity8 would be a devastating blow , not only ending his 2012 hopes but also damaging his future political prospects – a calculation that he may well be making in the coming days			2
on the back foot : @entity8 addresses supporters at his @entity2 and @entity6 primary night rally in @entity114 , @entity96 in @entity1 , @entity3 was introduced by congressman @entity115 , a rising @entity12 star and one of the big endorsements @entity3 received last week			1
@entity115 , chairman of the @entity118 , is a top prospect to become @entity3 ’s vice-presidential running mate			2
earlier in the day , @entity13 had begun general election hostilities by criticising @entity3 for embracing @entity115 ’s budget proposal and even mocking his probable general election opponent for his somewhat old - fashioned language			0
' he said that he ’s " very supportive " of this new budget , ' @entity13 said of @entity3 in a @entity7 speech			0
' and he even called it '' marvellous , '' which is a word you do n’t often hear when it comes to describing a budget			0
it ’s a word you do n’t hear generally			0
' crowd pleaser : @entity3 greets supporters at a town hall meeting in @entity1 , @entity2 ahead of the primary it 's show time : the podium ahead of primary election night for @entity3 video : years of flying in air force one puts you out of touch jokes @entity3			0

@entity3 gained 54pc of vote in @entity6
@entity8 faces *mounting* pressure to pull out of @entity12 race
