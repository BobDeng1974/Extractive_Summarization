by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 06:37 est , 14 january 2014 it 's not quite @entity3 but @entity4 did their best to add a shot of glamour to proceedings as @entity8 kicked off			1
although @entity10 , @entity11 and co were nowhere to be seen , the label sent models down the catwalk decked in racy lingerie livened up with the sort of unusual accessories that have become the @entity20 brand 's trademark			2
@entity22 masks , cowboy hats and carnivalesque tails were all present and correct , while models carried realistic - looking toy guns			0
bang ! a model poses , replica gun in hand , for photographers during the @entity4 show masked : models sported @entity22 masks made from scraps of paper and even bright red blooms earlier , @entity38 designer @entity37 , a favourite of local fashionistas , drew gasps from the watching crowd as she unveiled her vision for next autumn in vivid style			2
among the pieces to appear on the catwalk was a show - stopping crimson evening gown , complete with a vast rosette , and a beautiful kimono - inspired frock executed in cobalt silk			0
also taking to the catwalk at @entity8 was @entity55 's @entity54 , one of the few designers to emerge from the country , and who began her career as a bridal specialist in @entity61			1
her training was clearly in evidence , as she plumped for a palette focused on bride - friendly gold , cream and ivory			0
@entity69 wonder : one model appeared in a @entity73 's @entity72 style set of floral butterfly wings strutting their stuff : models appear on the runway during the @entity4 show in @entity80 not everything screamed wedding day however			1
in what looked like a bid to impress @entity87 's moneyed classes , there were jewels and embellishment aplenty , as well as a liberal hand with marabou trim			0
later this week , designs by @entity94 's @entity93 and @entity96 @entity95 are due to appear on the runway , while @entity100 brands @entity98 and @entity101 are among those exhibiting			2
the event , which pulls in 1 , 850 exhibitors from 29 different countries and runs until 16th january , also offers local brands the chance to persuade the watching world that they 're worth investing in , among them 2 % , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity113 @entity112 , @entity114 , i.t and @entity115			0
