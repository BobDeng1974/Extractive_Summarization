by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 15 july 2013 morbidly obese scouts have been banned from this year 's @entity3 's national jamboree because they would n't be able to hike around a new keep fit venue			1
more than 30,000 @entity1 ages 12 to 20 and their leaders were required to meet a threshold for body mass index and other health factors before being allowed to participate in the 10 day camp at a new location in @entity12			1
jamboree applicants with a @entity14 - a measure of body fat determined through height and weight — of 40 or higher were deemed ineligible			1
guidelines : morbidly obese scouts have been banned from this year 's @entity3 's national jamboree because they would n't be able to hike around new keep fit venue ( file photo ) those who fell between 32 and 39.9 faced providing additional health information to jamboree medical staff			1
nationally , about 17 percent of children ages 2 to 19 are considered obese — triple the rate from a generation earlier , according to the @entity28			2
this year 's gathering is being billed as the most physically demanding in its history - there is rock climbing , rappelling , whitewater rafting and biking and scouts will go about the sprawling , hilly landscape the old - fashioned way - on foot			1
officials designed the 1,000 - plus acre @entity42 to take advantage of the @entity12 's natural assets , and they also put into place new physical fitness requirements that eliminated morbidly obese scouts from participating			1
test : more than 3,000 scouts aged 12 to 20 were required to meet a threshold for body mass index to be allowed to take part in 10 day camp at a new location in @entity12 ' part of the design in building this site was to address the need for physical fitness in our youth , which of course is a longstanding component of @entity1 , ' said @entity63 , director of the @entity3 's @entity64			1
' we saw this as an opportunity to integrate some new challenges ... so we deliberately spread the site to enable us to encourage @entity1 and basically require scouts to move about the site by foot			1
' ' we required a level of fitness in order to come to the jamboree that we have n't required before , ' @entity63 said			1
' and that has motivated an enormous return in terms of both kids and adults getting serious about improving their health			2
' soon , the scouts will know why			1
besides offering a whole lot of fun , dozens of venues will test their physical skills and fitness			2
at some point during the @entity75 , every participating @entity1 will be asked to take a 3 - mile trek up a mountain			2
new arrival : tents that will house staff members at the @entity42 in @entity94 , @entity12			1
some 40,000 scouts , leaders and others will descended on southern @entity12 for the first ever @entity75 today their reward : a barbecue waiting at the top			1
' we certainly want to get the @entity1 outdoors , challenge them and have a healthy lifestyle , ' said @entity103 , the @entity42 's director of community and governmental relations			2
' we talk about the three @entity106 as kind of the pillars , and that is cardio , character and citizenship			2
we have all of those embodied here			0
' from 1981 to 2010 , the jamboree was held every four years in @entity116 , @entity117 that gathering on a flatter , borrowed @entity120 base limited the size and scope of the @entity75 's operations			2
in 2009 , southern @entity12 was chosen out of 80 proposals from 28 states as the @entity127 's new home			1
along with being the permanent home of the @entity127 , whose theme is ' @entity131 , ' the @entity42 will serve as one of four high - adventure camps for the @entity1 and will host the 2019 @entity134			0
' we required a level of fitness in order to come to the @entity75 that we have n't required before ' @entity63 , director of the @entity3 's @entity64			1
while @entity1 will be roughing it outdoors , @entity103 said walking wo n't be that rough			0
it 's 1.5 miles from the furthest tent to the center of activity at the @entity42 , compared to 3 miles at @entity116			0
even the short , casual stroll is n't meant to be boring			0
a 786 - foot suspension bridge connecting two of the @entity42 's six base camps to one of the outdoor activity centers has catwalks on either side			0
the summit 's offerings are numerous			0
there are simple activities such as fishing on four different lakes			0
there 's also the chance to get even wetter with whitewater rafting trips and learning to scuba dive and kayak in the @entity42 's @entity164 - sized pools			0
among the bigger , more extreme venues , there are 50 mountain bike trails			0
the 11 bmx tracks and jumps total the size of about five football fields			0
a paved skateboard park was built by the same team that designed venues for the @entity175 , and it includes a bowl , a vertical ramp , street - style combinations and a foam pit for @entity1 to try out new tricks			0
' this is the exact opposite of ' no skateboards or roller blades allowed , '' @entity103 said			2
some of the venue designs fit in with the @entity3 's motto of building @entity1 ' confidence because they enable the youngsters to choose what fits their skill levels			0
venues at @entity116 addressed only the average skill set			0
' those are very different approaches to what we 've done here that clearly is going to excite kids and provide opportunities that we 've never had before , ' @entity63 said			0
the planning includes incorporating safety procedures into staff training and venue oversight			0
scout leaders want to be careful that exercise does n't become exhaustion or worse			0
in 2005 , four adult scout leaders were killed in an electrical accident on the opening day of the jamboree			1
in the four days of intense heat that followed , more than 300 scouts and visitors fell ill. in 1997 , a @entity1 was killed at the jamboree after the @entity214 he was driving overturned .			1
