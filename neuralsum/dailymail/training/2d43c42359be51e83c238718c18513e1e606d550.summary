anorexia could be caused by a genetic mutation , according to new research @entity3 could be caused by a genetic mutation , according to new research			1
a study of the dna of more than 3,000 people found the eating disorder may be caused by mutations that interfere with the processing of cholesterol , disrupting mood and diet			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity16 , may lead to the development of drugs to treat the condition			0
sufferers starve themselves because they believe they are fat , and more than one in ten cases are fatal making it the deadliest of psychiatric illnesses			0
just 30 per cent of patients make a full recovery			0
although many experts believe the condition is caused by social pressure , there is growing evidence there may also be a genetic link			0
researchers analysed genetic information from more than 1,200 anorexia patients and almost 2,000 healthy controls			2
they looked for variants of genes that had already been linked to feeding behaviour or been flagged up in previous studies			0
just a handful of more than 150 genes studied showed signs of a link , but one stand out was the gene @entity46 , which controls an enzyme that regulates the burning of cholesterol			1
professor @entity51 , of the @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , said : ‘ when we saw that , we thought we might be onto something , because nobody else had reported this gene as having a pronounced role in anorexia			2
’ anorexia affects up to one in a hundred women but how it develops is still not fully understood			0
professor @entity51 added : ‘ these findings point in a direction probably no one would have considered taking before			0
’ his researchers followed up with several replication studies , each using a different cohort of anorexia patients and controls , as well as different genetic analysis methods			2
the scientists continued to find evidence that certain variants of @entity46 occur more frequently in people with anorexia			1
a study of the dna of more than 3,000 people found the eating disorder may be caused by mutations that interfere with the processing of cholesterol , disrupting mood and diet to help make sense of these findings , they looked at existing data from a large - scale , long - term heart disease study and determined that a subset of the implicated @entity46 variants have the effect of altering the normal relationship between weight gain and cholesterol levels			1
professor @entity51 said : ‘ we thought with further studies this @entity46 finding might go away , or appear less compelling , but we just kept finding evidence to suggest it plays a role in anorexia			1
’ it is not yet clear how @entity46 variants that cause an abnormal metabolism of cholesterol would help trigger or maintain anorexia			1
but professor @entity51 noted people with anorexia often have remarkably high cholesterol levels in their blood , despite being severely malnourished			1
anorexia sufferers starve themselves because they believe they are fat , and more than one in ten cases are fatal making it the deadliest of psychiatric illnesses			0
just 30 per cent of patients make a full recovery moreover , there have been suggestions from other studies weight loss , for example in people with depression , can lead to increases in cholesterol levels			1
at the same time , there is evidence cholesterol , a basic building block of cells , particularly in the brain , has a positive association with mood			1
it is possible some anorexics for genetic reasons may feel an improved mood , from having higher cholesterol , by not eating			2
professor @entity51 explained : ‘ the hypothesis would be in some anorexics the normal metabolism of cholesterol is disrupted , which could influence their mood as well as their ability to survive despite severe caloric restriction			2
’ around 60,000 @entity148 have anorexia			0
nine out of ten sufferers are women , the majority aged 15 to 25 .			0

anorexia could be caused by a mutation in the gene @entity46
this gene controls an enzyme that regulates the burning of cholesterol
@entity46 variants alter the relationship between weight gain and cholesterol
anorexics often have high cholesterol levels despite being malnourished
high cholesterol levels are associated with a positive mood suggesting people with anorexia are better able to cope with starvation
