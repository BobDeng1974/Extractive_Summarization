in an interview with @entity23 magazine , the @entity20 presenter said she works so hard as an mp that it may have caused a recent bout of pneumonia			1
she said : ‘ i plough my furrow , i work hard in my constituency			1
i work seven days a week : it ’s exhausting , which is why i ’ve had pneumonia			1
' but this job is nothing like as demanding as my old job – this is completely civilised			2
‘ i get to see more of everything , more of my constituents , more of the girls for sure , more of my @entity40 as well , so it ’s tons better			1
