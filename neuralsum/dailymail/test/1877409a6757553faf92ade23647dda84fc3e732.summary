what the hell am i doing , i ask myself , as i stand shivering on the brink			0
it ’s april and my first proper swim of the year			0
the @entity6 stretches before me			1
i dip a toe in			1
i wobble over the sharp shingle , into the waves , until i ’m waist - deep			0
gasping for breath , i take the plunge			0
and , within seconds , making frantic strokes , i ’m swept up and i ’m swimming			1
miserable winters , exams , love affairs			0
i ’ve swum through them all , wherever i can find the water			1
most of the time this means municipal pools from which i emerge reeking of chlorine and praying i ’ve avoided verrucas			0
so best of all has to be swimming outdoors , and here on the @entity51 in @entity25 it is now warm enough — just about — for the sea			1
and despite the greyness , the appalling cold , and the downright bleakness of the @entity6 here , i ’m in heaven			1
the poet @entity57 — who was every bit as proud of his phenomenal swimming prowess as his verses — called the experience a ‘ buoyancy of spirits i never feel on any other occasion ’			1
i do n’t have to swim the four - mile - long @entity65 between @entity66 and @entity67 as he did to know what he meant			0
@entity69 , too , am buoyed up in every way			0
yet i ’m not one of those athletic people who glide through the water with a sleek , racing crawl			1
nor am i that hardy chap i read about recently , known as the ‘ human polar bear ’ , who swims round icebergs in the @entity79			0
a 30 - minute dip leaves me exhausted			1
i ca n’t even dive			0
you need look no further than @entity82 in @entity33 to see how a dip in the ocean can set pulses racing i ’m that woman with the white - hatted head bobbing up and down offshore in a rather staid breast stroke			1
but in the water i do n’t care			1
and , for me , that ’s the magic of swimming			1
for a few precious moments , all my troubles wash away			0
nothing bothers me and my whole world flows ‘ swimmingly ’			0
of course , it would be easier to get in if it were n’t so damned cold — nudging a steely @entity98 ( 47f )			1
yet however enticing it is to bask in languid , tropical waters along with colourful fish , and laze about in @entity103 and @entity104 seas , give me the @entity105 any day			1
because , for me , the most perfect swim of all is in @entity107 , off the @entity108			0
what i love is the emptiness , the menthol cool of the water			1
on the @entity113 i have found deserted bays and swum completely alone or just with those i love , the sea crystal - clear and only the sound of the curlews and the water lapping over the rock pools			1
it ’s not warm , of course , but immersed in that wild sea is the closest to beauty i have ever been			0
why does it affect me so ? @entity125 , not surprisingly , had a view on a love of swimming			1
he believed it disguised a desire to return to the amniotic waters of the womb			1
but that ’s the sort of @entity136 thing he would say			0
i prefer the thoughts of novelist @entity139 , so much more restrained , who simply declared swimming ‘ delightful ’			1
she found the combination of sea air and sea water ‘ nearly infallible ’ and ‘ a match for every disorder ’			1
to the @entity147 , swimming was a most manly , heroic occupation , so much so that they defined an ignorant man as one who ‘ neither knows how to read or swim ’			1
@entity152 , the cruel and brutally wanton roman emperor , deemed himself a god but his contemporaries whispered he was a wimp — behind his back , presumably — because he could n’t manage a front crawl or even a doggy - paddle			0
i came across a similar attitude when i lived in @entity160 and finally plucked up the courage to swim in the famous , natural , spring - fed ponds on @entity21			1
the exclusive ladies pond is in a picture - perfect setting , surrounded by trees and wild flowers			0
but i was scared to go in			0
the problem was i could n’t see the bottom			0
the water was so black and deep , my thoughts would turn black and ominous too , imagining drowning and wondering how many rats were lurking in the murky shadows			1
but one day , the local indoor pool i used was unexpectedly closed			0
so i braved the pond			0
and it was a revelation			0
i felt i was swimming through silk			2
i never knew water could be so soft and i forgot about the rats and the unknown depths			2
and with all the passion of a convert i became so keen on the fresh water and splashing about with ducks i was determined to swim there all year round			2
poet @entity57 ( left ) was a prodigious swimmer , once crossing the four - mile @entity65 from @entity66 to @entity67 , while @entity139 praised the sea air and water as ' a match for every disorder ' i bought neoprene gloves and shoes and , as autumn came and the temperature dropped , i invested in a wet - suit			2
because although there is something to be said for the way you emerge from cold water stinging and tingling as if heated by a feverish drug , i ’m not hardy enough for swimming through liquid ice			1
but , unfortunately , i was not allowed to wear my new wetsuit — ‘ not in the spirit of the ponds ’ , i was told by the strict @entity21 matriarchs who police it			1
and my passion faltered and i had to wait again for warmer weather			0
the coldness of our climate meant that , for centuries in @entity212 , swimming in the wild for pleasure was considered close to madness			2
the sea and rivers were regarded as sources of disease rather than pleasure			0
and the @entity220 saw swimming as a rather sinful pursuit , possibly because @entity147 treated it as the opportunity for more erotic activities than a few hale and hearty lengths			2
but then , at the end of the 18th century , @entity225 gave swimming the royal stamp of approval by taking dips in the sea off @entity231 , accompanied apparently by a band who struck up @entity234 every time he popped his head out of the water			1
in 1824 , @entity212 ’s first swimming society was formed by a group of @entity240			2
the @entity241 and @entity242 of their day initiated non-swimmers by taking them out onto the @entity245 and chucking them in			0
the @entity246 had more gentle ways of learning to swim			0
a @entity248 of 1879 suggested learning from frogs — by catching one , putting it in a bowl of water and then lying your body across a table and imitating the way it moved			2
@entity225 brought swimming to fashion in @entity260 after years of scepticism from prudish members of the church whatever methods people learned to swim they were effective and , as more people took to the waters , something had to be done , in the name of modesty , about the habit of swimming naked			1
a cover - up campaign began , much to the annoyance of @entity274 , a @entity276 curate who , in 1872 , complained about the ‘ detestable custom of bathing in drawers ’			2
he loved ‘ the delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea ’			2
forced to put on underwear ( red and white striped ) to conceal himself , he complained that : ‘ if ladies do n’t like to see men naked , why do n’t they keep away from the sight ? ’ indeed given the hysteria generated by @entity33 actor @entity82 ’s quick @entity295 dip , watching men swimming seems to be a pleasure that has never dimmed			1
personally , i hate being seen swimming , though others clearly do n’t			2
on the nearest beach to me , the determinedly old - fashioned @entity300 on the @entity25 coast , i watch doughty local residents wander through the town in great towelling robes for a morning dip , proudly showing off bodies leathered and tanned by years of immersion in the sea			2
they are following in the footsteps of the composer @entity311 , the town ’s most famous resident , who extolled the virtues of cold water ‘ just to wake you up ’			1
on a good day , he ’d manage as many as five ‘ bathes ’ , as he called them , fitting them in between rehearsals and lunch , as well as late at night in the moonlight			0
his love affair with water lasted through his whole life			2
he composed the piano piece @entity327 , which captures all the initial pain and ultimate pleasure of a swim off the @entity260 coast — that ‘ it ’s lovely when you ’re in ’ feeling			2
but the problem , for me , is the indignity of actually getting in and out of the sea			0
it ’s bad enough trying to keep your feet as you stagger in			0
but , unless it is unusually calm , there ’s not a hope of emerging from the surf with the composure of bikini - clad @entity345 in the @entity347 film dr no. as i get out , the waves can be so pebble - filled - heavy i ’m often hurled flat on my face and have to scrabble over the stones on my stomach			0
but the humiliation of looking like a seal heaving itself onto dry land is worth it for the joy of that swim			0
so i will continue to confront the @entity6 , take delight when the temperature climbs a few degrees as we head into summer in the weeks ahead and then grit my teeth again as it plummets back into winter			1
because i know from experience that , whatever the season , once i ’m swimming , i ’m reminded , however briefly , how wonderful it is to be alive .			2

@entity18 began swimming outside after a dip on @entity21
now goes for regular dips in the bracing *8c* waters of the @entity6
says nothing beats the ' silky smooth ' feeling of swimming in cold water
