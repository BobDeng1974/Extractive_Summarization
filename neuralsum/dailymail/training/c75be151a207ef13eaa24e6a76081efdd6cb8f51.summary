by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 16 april 2012 updated : 03:35 est , 17 april 2012 under fire : @entity3 prime minister @entity2 could soon be forced to ask for a bailout @entity3 plunged deeper into crisis yesterday amid mounting fears that it will need an emergency bailout to save it from financial ruin			1
borrowing costs soared and the cost of insuring @entity3 debt against default hit a record high as investors fretted about the health of the economy and banking system			1
the bleak start to the week sparked warnings that @entity3 will be the fourth eurozone country to need a bailout following the rescues of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
a report by the @entity27 is today expected to warn that the eurozone faces recession this year with @entity3 and @entity30 among those economies worst hit			1
‘ we ’re back in full crisis mode , ’ said @entity32 , a strategist at banking giant @entity33			0

economy minister @entity55 yesterday conceded that the country was back in recession			1
anger : frustration at what is seen as a never - ending line of cuts has resulted in a series of riots across @entity3 in recent weeks he said the first three months of 2012 followed ‘ a similar pattern to the last quarter of last year ’ when output fell 0.3 per cent – resulting in two consecutive quarters of decline			0
@entity70 pledged to loan $ 60billion to the @entity27 today in an effort to ensure the debt crisis in some @entity43 economies will not spread			1

@entity3 ten - year bond yields – the interest the government pays to borrow money – jumped above 6 per cent for the first time this year to 6.17 per cent			0
that put @entity53 firmly back in the danger zone with yields worryingly close to the 7 per cent level which triggered emergency bailouts in other countries			0
borrowing costs in @entity3 are now higher than in december when the @entity104 flooded the eurozone banking system with cheap funds in a desperate attempt to prevent another credit crunch and ease pressure on countries such as @entity30 and @entity3			1
‘ this artificial high from the @entity104 drugs has worn off and now we ’re basically back to where we started , ’ said @entity111 , head of economic research at @entity113			0
‘ after three months that were calmer than expected , the euro crisis is back , ’ said @entity118 , chief economist at @entity119 in @entity120			0
‘ the speed of the recent surge in yields has elements of a renewed market panic			0
’ despite the doom and gloom , @entity43 markets opened slightly up this morning			2
help : the @entity104 may be forced to intervene in the @entity3 crisis should the country 's 10 - year government bond rate rise even further the @entity134 started 0.26 per cent up at 5,681.19 ; @entity137 's @entity136 is 0.30 per cent up at 3,215.03 and @entity139 's @entity138 is 0.48 per cent up at 6,656.77			1

benchmarks in mainland @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 fell while @entity166 and the @entity167 rose			0
a strong retail sales report in the @entity146 was not enough to counteract fears that the debt crisis enveloping @entity43 's smaller economies might morph into something even bigger			1
' @entity157 stress , particularly in @entity3 continues to act as a weight on market sentiment , with equity markets ignoring a relatively strong @entity146 retail sales report , ' said analysts at @entity179 in @entity154			1
rising bond yields in @entity3 ahead of this week 's bond auctions are expected to refocus attention on the debt crisis ( pictured : @entity183 , @entity53 )			2
