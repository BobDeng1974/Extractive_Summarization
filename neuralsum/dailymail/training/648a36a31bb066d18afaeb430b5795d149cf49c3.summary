by @entity0 published : 17:49 est , 24 november 2012 updated : 10:47 est , 25 november 2012 light touch : @entity3 's recent weight loss has helped with her joint problems from playing the world ’s laziest cleaner , mrs @entity8 , in @entity9 to a long - suffering teacher in the @entity11 , @entity5 has never been shy about taking on unglamorous roles			1
so it is a surprise when the 43 - year - old comedy actress opens the door to her @entity17 home wearing a silk cocktail dress and with her long blonde hair stylishly tousled			1
this irony is n’t lost on @entity3			1
but she says she is enjoying fashion for the first time after years of struggling with her weight – the lasting legacy of being blighted with arthritis in her late teens and early 20s			1
at its worst , it left her unable to walk without crutches			1
having appeared with @entity29 , @entity30 , and most recently , @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity34 ’s comedy series @entity35 , @entity3 ’s achievements are all the more remarkable as she almost did n’t get into drama school due to her severe illness			1
‘ i come from an acting family , so i always wanted to get into the profession , ’ explains @entity3			1
‘ i was determined to get into drama school			1
’ @entity3 ’s father @entity41 was in hit tv show @entity43 and her @entity45 great - grandmother was a film actress			1
when she was 18 , @entity3 picked up a stomach bug during a trip to the @entity49 to see a boyfriend			1
‘ he was training to be a chef so we never figured out if it was from a duck salad he ’d made or a tin of tuna , ’ explains @entity3			2
‘ i had a bad tummy for a day , and then two weeks later i went to stay with my dad in @entity61			2
’ on the first night of her summer job – working as a waitress in her father ’s restaurant – she felt inexplicably tired			1
‘ my dad joked what a softie i was , ’ recalls @entity3			2
‘ but the next night i awoke at 4am in the most excruciating pain			1
my knees had swollen up , my toes blew up like sausages , and my feet felt very painful			2
i was screaming in agony , and taken to hospital			2
’ @entity3 ’s joints were so badly affected that she was bedridden for four weeks			1
‘ i had to have a cage around the bed , as even the weight of the sheets caused me intense pain			1
’ after two weeks of intensive tests , doctors finally diagnosed the problem			2
‘ i had a bug called @entity86 in my intestine – the food poisoning i ’d had in @entity49 – which led to reactive arthritis			2
’ sometimes called @entity92 ’s syndrome , this occurs when a primary infection , either from food poisoning or a sexually transmitted disease , triggers an inflammatory response in the body			1
no one knows why it happens			2
up to four weeks after an initial infection , the body ’s immune systems appear to malfunction and attack healthy tissue and , rarely , other organs			1
frequently just the feet and hips and knees are affected			2
up to 3,000 @entity108 develop this condition every year and one in seven people develops long - term problems			2
dr @entity113 , spokesman for @entity114 , says : ‘ patients are hit suddenly by very painful arthritis , usually when they are fairly young			2
it can be very hard to cope with psychologically			0
’ @entity3 was badly affected			0
‘ i could n’t walk for weeks			0
medication began to help slowly but it was ages before i was even allowed to use crutches to get out the room , ’ she explains			0
‘ before this happened i was sporty , so to suddenly lose my health like this was difficult to cope with			0
’ broken dream : @entity3 , left , as @entity126 on hardware with co-star @entity128 and special guest @entity129 , almost gave up on her career as an actor due to her joint pains dr @entity133 , a rheumatologist at the @entity134 , explained to @entity3 what would happen next			1
‘ he told me that the condition could vanish at any point , so i just had to take painkillers and hope for the best			0
’ @entity3 tried to start a course at secretarial college but within days she collapsed and had to go home for weeks of recuperation			0
eventually her health improved enough for her to complete her course			0
she then started temping during the day and taking part in amateur dramatic productions in the evenings			0
‘ i managed to get auditions for @entity149 and the @entity150 but was too ill at first to complete the physically demanding weekend workshops that accompanied them , ’ she recalls			0
‘ i went back for the next three years but tutors on the panels would say , “ why are you applying if you are unwell ? ” i kept explaining that the condition could disappear but no one believed me			0
finally i managed to get in at the @entity159 , which was a huge relief			0
‘ at drama school , i was much better			0
i had cortisone injections in my knees and hips every three months to provide pain relief , so i was getting more mobile			1
however , the arthritis would flare up twice a year			0
i was also putting on weight because i was unable to exercise			0
’ luckily for @entity3 , she quickly found work after finishing her course , including stints at the @entity170			0
‘ my knees continued to be a problem but i simply could n’t afford to jeopardise my career and admit to the pain , so i just carried on			1
’ she had a series of arthroscopies – keyhole surgical procedures to examine the inside of the joint and trim or remove cartilage or any loose bone – when she was 24 to improve her mobility			0
lazy on screen : @entity3 , pictured as mrs @entity8 on @entity9 with co-stars @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , had surgery at 24 to improve her mobility it was discovered that her knees were dysplastic , which means the shape of the kneecap and the groove that is supposed to move in do not quite match up , so the kneecap grates on the lower leg bone			0
‘ doctors thought the reactive arthritis had caused damage to the joints , ’ she explains			1
finally , @entity3 ’s health stabilised in her mid- 20s , although there have been the occasional flare - ups			1
while working on @entity9 in 2008 , she had her first child , @entity203 , with husband @entity204 , 47 , an office manager , and has since slimmed down to a size 12 from a size 22			0
‘ having a child really made it imperative i look after myself a bit better , and i did manage to lose the weight quite quickly			0
’ for those with knee problems , being lighter is one of the most effective ways of preventing complications			0
@entity3 hopes her story will give hope to other youngsters affected by similar problems			0
‘ for years i did n’t know if i ’d ever get my life back or make it into acting , ’ she says			1
‘ i ’d encourage everyone afflicted by this type of illness to never give up fighting for your dreams			0
’ @entity228 ’s @entity35 is now available on dvd			1
@entity3 will be appearing in heading out on @entity230 in the @entity231 .			0
