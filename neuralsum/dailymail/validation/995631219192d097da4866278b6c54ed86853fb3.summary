the costly legal standoff over @entity1 took a dramatic turn yesterday when @entity4 prosecutors said they were prepared to question the @entity6 founder in @entity7			1
for almost three years @entity1 , pictured , has been claiming asylum in @entity11 ’s @entity10 embassy to avoid extradition to @entity4 over rape allegations			1
the 43 - year - old faces arrest if he steps outside , and taxpayers have spent more than £ 10million on police who monitor him 24 hours a day			1
@entity4 prosecutors have offered to travel to @entity11 to question @entity6 founder @entity1 @entity4 officials until now refused to question him in @entity11 over the allegations of rape , sexual assault and illegal coercion			1
but yesterday lead prosecutor @entity24 announced that they will now travel to @entity7 – because time is running out			0
under @entity4 law they only have until august to pursue the claims relating to sexual assault and illegal coercion			2
miss @entity24 said that an interview conducted at the embassy would be of lower ‘ quality ’ , but added : ‘ now that time is of the essence , i have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies			0
’ her team will also seek a dna swab			0
@entity1 , who is currently holed up in the @entity10 embassy , is wanted for questioning in @entity4 over sexual assault allegations today one of the @entity43 's lawyers welcomed the offer by @entity4 prosecutors to travel to the @entity7 and said it was likely their offer would be accepted			1
' this is something we 've demanded for over four years , ' said @entity49			0
' @entity1 wants to be interviewed so he can be exonerated			2
so of course we welcome this			0
' however , @entity1 may stay in the embassy for another five years until the more serious allegation of rape also expires in @entity4 law			1
by then the bill for @entity57 ’s sentry duty would be around £ 30million			0
@entity1 ’s spokesman @entity58 has repeatedly said that the activist – who denies the accusations – has no intention of turning himself in			0
yesterday , mr @entity58 called the offer by @entity4 prosecutors ‘ a victory for @entity1 ’ , but insisted the delay had been ‘ absolutely outrageous ’			1
he said : ' i assume this is because it is extremely likely that @entity1 will win a case in the @entity69 in @entity4 , determining that the arrest warrant be dropped			1
@entity1 's lawyers welcome the move by the @entity4 prosecutors to travel to @entity11 to quiz him the surveillance operation outside the @entity10 embassy has so far cost the @entity7 taxpayers £ 10million ' the court has recently announced it will hear the case , and it is quite obvious it will rule in @entity1 's favour			1
' mr @entity58 said the @entity4 prosecutor had ' done nothing ' to move the case forward for years			0
@entity1 has been fighting extradition to @entity4 since it issued a warrant for his arrest in august 2010			1
two years later he was granted political asylum by @entity10			0
he believes that if he goes to @entity4 , he will be extradited to the @entity86 and questioned over classified state documents that were published by @entity6			2
last month @entity88 , @entity11 deputy mayor for policing , said the cost of guarding the embassy was ‘ eye - watering ’			2
police have been station outside the embassy building in @entity95 round the clock since @entity1 arrived in june 2012			2
he has been granted asylum by the government of @entity10 but can not travel there because he will be arrested first			0
in that time he has given a series of speeches from the balcony of the building and ' attended ' conferences around the world by video message .			0
