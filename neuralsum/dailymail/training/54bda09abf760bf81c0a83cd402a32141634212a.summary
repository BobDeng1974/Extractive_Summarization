by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 1 june 2012 it is the machine that helped wipe horse - drawn carriages from the streets of @entity4			1
and now , 102 years on from its heyday , one of the capital 's original motorised black cabs is ready to hit the road again after years wasting away in a @entity12 barn			1
the incredibly - rare @entity15 - made @entity14 motor , one of only hundreds made for @entity18 , was picking up @entity4 's upper classes in 1910 , and is now up for auction			1
toot toot ! this incredibly rare original @entity4 black cab from 1910 has emerged from a barn in @entity24 where it has been languishing for 15 years piece of history : the black cab was in its heyday 100 years ago and still retains its taxi meter and includes switches in the back so the passengers could tell the driver which way to go with its original taxi meter , and century - old intercom system , it has not been seen widely since 1955 , when it appeared alongside star @entity38 in the 1955 flick ‘ the man who loved @entity41 ’			1
the car , which has a top speed of 40mph , has been kept in a barn near @entity46 in @entity24 for the last 15 years			1
now , it could fetch more than £ 20,000			1
@entity48 , whose saleroom is selling the car , said : ' @entity14 was a quality @entity15 manufacturer			1
off the road : the 102 - year - old cab in the barn at @entity24 , and it has now been beautifully restored and prepared for sale history : a newspaper article about the car being bought 60 years ago			1
it has been in the same family ever since ' they were the original black cabs and took over from horse drawn carriages			2
i expect most of them have been destroyed and we do n’t know how many are left			2
the first @entity4 black cab - a horse and coach - appeared in the 17th century , named after the @entity15 term hacquenée , which means literally ' ambling nag '			1
in 1625 there were as few as 20 , operating out of pub yards			2
until 1831 anyone , generally , could drive one until the @entity74 was passed , and the @entity75 took over licensing the trade			2
then 60 years later fixed fares ended when the taximeter was invented and added , allowing drivers to charge for each trip individually			2
it also led to the name ' taxi '			2
the first motorised version came towards the end of the 19th century , and was electrically powered			0
around a decade later petrol cars took over but they were from all over the world and different shapes and sizes			0
it was only in the 1930s that the cabs had to be @entity12 and the last horse and coach taxi disappeared in 1947			0
' this is in great condition with the original leather interior and it still has its meter			0
there is also a mechanism for the passengers to tell the driver which way to go			0
' it has a 16 horsepower engine with a three speed gearbox and would have gone about 30 or 40mph			0
' it has wooden wheels with early pneumatic tyres and has paraffin powered lights on the front and back			0
' it became a minor celebrity in its own right and made public appearances and appeared in films			1
' i ’m sure there will be a lot of interest at the sale			1
' the @entity15 firm made 1,400 of the cars , with 800 right - hand drive versions being exported to the @entity18			1
it is not known how many are left today			0
its history with the family that now owns it began when a reverend @entity132 saw it by chance in @entity135 , where it was due to be exported to @entity137 , and bought it in the 1950s			0
it has remained in the family ever since			0
the auction will be held at the @entity141 race circuit , @entity142 , @entity143 , on june 30			0
long gone : in the past @entity4 was filled with carriages like this one , but motorised vehicles spelled the end for them			0

the 102 - year - old cab is up for sale and could fetch more than £ 20,000
it was kept in a @entity24 barn and has now been completely *refurbished*
this car was used in the 1955 flick ‘ the man who loved @entity41 ’ and has not been seen in public since
