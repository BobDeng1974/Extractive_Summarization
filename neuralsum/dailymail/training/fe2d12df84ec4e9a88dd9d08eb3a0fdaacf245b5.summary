by @entity0 last updated at 10:24 am on 17th february 2012 @entity1 : pay has soared from £ 140,000 in 2007 to £ 235,000 last year one of @entity5 ’s highest - paid quango bosses receives his £ 235,000 a year salary via a private company , it emerged yesterday			1
@entity1 , an ‘ innovation director ’ at the @entity10 , is the latest public sector official revealed to be exploiting a loophole that could save him thousands of pounds a year in tax			1
the obscure quango , which was set up in 2007 to promote innovation in business , has paid him more than £ 1million in this way over the past five years			1
the news comes amid mounting controversy over so - called ‘ tax dodging ’ in the public sector			0
at least 25 senior staff at the @entity23 receive their pay via private companies , which are often registered at their home addresses			1
astonishingly , the head of a union for top civil servants has claimed that the controversial pay deals show that officials ’ salaries are too low			2
@entity33 , general secretary of the @entity34 , said the previous @entity36 government had tried to recruit senior figures from the private sector without matching their wages			2
he said : ‘ what we have found is that in certain cases , because the market rate was so much greater than the salary that would have been offered in the civil service , various deals were being done , and some of these are now being exposed			0
from yesterday 's @entity49 ‘ we now need to be very transparent , very clear that this can not continue , but at the same time grasp the very difficult political nettle , which is to address pay at the senior levels of the civil service			2
frankly it ’s a shambles – ministers are going to have to raise the salaries			0
’ the @entity10 refused to comment on the details of mr @entity1 ’s remuneration pending a review by the @entity61			1
the quango ’s accounts show that mr @entity1 is employed as a contractor , meaning his tax and national insurance contributions are not deducted at source			1
they also show that his pay has risen sharply , from £ 140,000 in 2007 to £ 235,000 last year			1
the revelation is a major embarrassment for the @entity72 , which sponsors the organisation			0
a source at the department blamed the previous government for agreeing to mr @entity1 ’s employment status			1
they said he would be required to go on the quango ’s payroll , with tax deducted at source , when his contract comes up for review in july			0
‘ this is a type of arrangement that we do not want to see continuing in the public sector , ’ they added			0
@entity91 said : ‘ taxpayers will be angry to see someone who receives such an enormous pay cheque from a taxpayer - funded body using a mechanism that could afford him significant tax advantages			2
it ’s a ridiculous situation if even some people who are employed by the government , directly or at arm ’s length , are n’t paying the right taxes			0
’ probe : @entity105 has ordered an urgent review into civil servants exploiting the tax loophole @entity105 , chief secretary to the treasury , ordered an urgent review into the pay practice two weeks ago after it emerged that the head of the @entity113 , @entity114 , used a similar arrangement to cut the tax bill on his £ 182,000 salary			1
mr @entity114 was placed on the organisation ’s payroll following public outcry			0
last december , the @entity72 and the @entity23 told shadow cabinet office minister @entity121 that they did not employ any civil servants via private companies			1
however , leaked emails from the @entity23 suggest that officials may have deliberately misled @entity126 to avoid ‘ reputational ’ damage and any resulting tax investigations			2
mr @entity121 said he was writing to all government departments to demand a clear statement on the situation – but @entity36 ’s efforts to make political capital out of the situation were undermined as it emerged that shadow health secretary @entity135 employs his own chief of staff using the same technique			2
communities secretary @entity138 yesterday introduced rules requiring local councils to publish full details of the pay deals of senior executives			0
they will also be required to review pay arrangements that ‘ could be perceived as seeking to minimise tax payments ’			0
mr @entity138 said : ‘ local people have a right to know whether any town hall tax - dodgers are short - changing the public purse			0

@entity1 paid £ 1m via a private company since 2007
at least 25 @entity23 staff receive pay via private companies
