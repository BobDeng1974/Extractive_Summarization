get ready to feel a ghostly shiver down your spine			1
this is the haunting moment a chair was caught on @entity5 apparently moving on its own in a closed theatre hours after a psychic finished his show			1
it was recorded at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , at around 4am on sunday			1
he told @entity31 he now believes the video could prove there 's a resident ghost			2
' when i saw the footage i jumped up and said , " yes , now we have direct proof ! " ' i had a feeling earlier that there was the presence of something , a playful presence of a child , to one side of the room and it seems that must have been it , ' he said			1
' it does n't surprise me , it 's that sort of a place - it 's really active - so when i heard about what had happened i was really excited			2
' to me there is no way there is anyone in that theatre when the chair moves and there 's no way anyone can say it is staged			1
i 've never seen anything like this directly caught on camera , this is something that is paranormal			1
' people ca n't dispute that , they will try , but they ca n't dispute it			2
i am 100 per cent sure that is energy			2
' mr @entity29 said he now plans to take a team of paranormal investigators to the theatre to investigate further			1
@entity20 , who runs the 140 - seat volunteer - run theatre , told @entity31 the ghostly goings - on were not a surprise			1
chilling : the imprint of what is believed to be a child 's foot , just one of the ghostly goings - on @entity20 , who runs the 140 - seat volunteer - run theatre , has experienced is this real ? a photograph of a ghostly figure mr @entity20 says a cast member saw appear in his theatre the theatre is housed inside @entity87 building medium @entity29 believes the footage offers conclusive proof supernatural powers exist the building is a former second world war memorial and social club for senior citizens , and in the two years since it was converted into a theatre he says it 's had plenty of unexplained events			1
' the only reason we checked the cctv was because we came in on sunday morning and the chair was out of line , ' he said			1
' one of the last things i do when i close up is line - up all the chairs so i knew something had happened			0
' there is also a table that moved but that 's harder to make out			2
i 'm quite sceptical about all this kind of thing but my wife is n't , she believes in it			0
' there have been several things that have happened in the past , noises and creeks etc , but we 've got used to it			0
' we 've had a child 's footprints in the foyer , and one cast member said he saw a strange figure once			0
he ran after it thinking it was a person , but the figure just disappeared and there was nowhere for it to go			0
he was visibly shaken after that			0
' another cast member says he was pushed into a toilet , and he 's a big chap so we do n't think a person could have done it			0
' up until now though we 've just kept quiet about all this , what with it being a war memorial			0
' it 's quite interesting , we do n't know whether to laugh or cry			0
' lots of people have been emailing in saying faked it but i can assure you i 've neither the time or the knowledge to do that ! '			0
