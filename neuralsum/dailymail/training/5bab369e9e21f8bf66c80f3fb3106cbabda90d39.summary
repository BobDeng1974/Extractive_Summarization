by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 28 may 2013 it is an ambitious trip that has demanded meticulous planning , navigating and attention to detail			0
but a 20 - year - old hoping to become the youngest person to fly around the world solo overlooked one small , but very significant , item - his passport			2
@entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , began his flight last thursday when he flew from his hometown to @entity14 , @entity15			1
@entity9 , with his @entity17 20 single - engine plane which he plans to circle the globe in @entity9 piloted his first introductory glider at 13 and on his 14th birthday , he became the youngest pilot in his flying club to solo a glider he then flew to @entity24 via @entity25 - but stumbled when he arrived at @entity26 , @entity27 and realised his passport was missing			1
the ambitious pilot , who hopes to break the @entity29 on his mission , had left it at home in his photocopier , where he had been making copies of it			1
his mistake cost him two days - which could scupper his chances of breaking the record			2
the hopeful pilot told the @entity40 that when he handed his passport case to a customs official , he was shocked when he was told it was not there			0
@entity9 ( seen right with his passport ) plans to fly an estimated 21,000 nautical miles ( 38,892 kilometers ) with stoppovers in 14 countries , is attempting to become the youngest pilot to fly solo around the world you remembered ! a @entity51 immigration officer checks his passport after he arrived in @entity52 after frantically searching his plane , and convinced he must have left it during one of his stops where he visited friends and family , he called his mother who organised a search party			1
but after the forgetful flyer recalled he had been making copies of his visas and identification , his mother discovered the passport at their home			1
his passport was shipped overnight , much to the relief of @entity9			1
' i was a little annoyed that i forgot it , but it was nice to get the extra rest , ' he told the @entity40			0
' i had time built in my schedule for mishaps like this			0
i just did n't expect it to be my passport and more of something later down the road			0
' his ambitious route takes him through @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 in his quest to break the record @entity9 said he had factored in time for mishaps - but never thought it would be about forgetting his passport after the mishap he flew directly to @entity93 , @entity94 in a seven - hour trip			1
his route takes him through @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87			0
so far he has flown to @entity52 in the @entity51 - and has had no trouble with his passport so far			0
the ambitious flyer says on his blog @entity100 his dream to circle the globe began after he made history on his 13th birthday when he piloted his first introductory glider			1
at just 14 , he became the youngest pilot in the @entity107 to solofly a glider , and flew his first single - engine power plane solo when he was 16			2
the pilot is being sponsored on his tour , and donating the proceeds to @entity113 , the largest youth mentoring program in the @entity115 , and @entity116 , an organization focused on benefiting returning veterans			0
the youngest pilot to fly around the world is @entity120 from @entity121 , who was born in december 1991 and aged 21 circumnavigated the globe in a @entity123 from @entity124 , @entity121 , between 8 july and 29 august 2012 .			2
