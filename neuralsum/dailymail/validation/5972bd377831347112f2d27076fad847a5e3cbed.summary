few would be surprised if @entity1 's love affair with the @entity2 had turned sour and he had filed for divorce long ago			1
four wins are outnumbered by a list of defeats , some of them crushing			1
but if you have to feel real pain to truly appreciate ultimate happiness , the @entity13 trainer could experience a legal high to catapult him over the grandstand if @entity16 wins the @entity17 on friday			1
road to @entity19 ( right ) , ridden by @entity20 , jumps the last to win the @entity21 in december trainer @entity1 has high hopes for @entity23 in the @entity17 the winner of the @entity25 , who will be ridden by @entity20 , is one of 18 remaining			1
he may have lost his place as shortest - priced @entity30 contender – that now is well - backed @entity32 - trained @entity31 - but @entity1 's hope is arguably the form horse from across the water			2
few would have even dreamt of a @entity17 challenge when the eight - year - old landed the @entity38 in august			2
back then he was a promising gelding beginning to bounce back from a disappointing slump thanks to a change in his diet and work routine			0
his only defeat since – behind @entity46 over two and a half miles at @entity48 in october – came in a race that had not been on his original schedule and was a mistaken afterthought			0
when the gelding , owned by @entity55 boss @entity54 , landed the @entity25 at @entity56 over @entity57 , defeating 2014 @entity17 runner - up on his own and @entity60 's @entity17 mount @entity61 , hopes were raised that @entity1 might finally secure the feature @entity62 he craves			1
@entity20 celebrates after riding @entity64 to victory at the 2014 @entity66 @entity1 celebrates after road to riches win the @entity38 , ridden by @entity68 ( right ) @entity1 , the seven - time @entity30 champion trainer who started training in 1970 , saddled @entity70 to twice finish third in the @entity17 behind @entity71			1
he said : ' anyone who trains a jumping horse wants to win the @entity17			2
i would rather win one @entity17 than 10 @entity75			2
to me that is just an ordinary race compared to the @entity17			2
' the @entity17 and the @entity79 , they are the two cherries			2
' the latter race was a ' cherry ' that was picked out of @entity1 's back pocket in 2005 when @entity84 cruised up to @entity85 with long - time jockey ally @entity86 sitting motionless			1
it looked done and dusted until , in a dramatic final 50 yards , the rallying reigning champion trained by the late @entity90 got his head back in front			0
it was a result as tough to take for @entity1 as the short - head 1998 @entity95 defeat of @entity97 by @entity99 's @entity98 when he was still searching for his first @entity2 winner			1
@entity1 - trained @entity70 ( right ) twice finished third behind @entity71 in the @entity17 @entity84 's ( left ) capitulation to @entity85 in the 2005 @entity102 was hard to take for @entity1 @entity1 said : ' @entity103 was the one that hurt the most			1
he was going to win and then did n't			0
i was watching with @entity90 and he was nearly congratulating me			0
he had his hand on my shoulder and then , the next moment , it was just like someone had pulled a trap door from underneath me			0
' @entity97 was also tough			0
@entity99 came over and said i am sure you have won but , luckily , @entity113 had ridden mine and said he thought we were beat			0
but the photo - finish went on for so long			0
' when they called the result , i walked straight out and went back to the car park			0
' i talked to the attendant for half an hour about the joys of parking cars at @entity2			2
it just me got away from the whole thing			0
' the disappointments meant @entity1 became used to a familiar refrain before each @entity2			1
the trainer said : ' the same thing would start			0
' @entity1 has never had a winner ' and at @entity2 previews some fella in the audience would start getting on to you			1
you 'd say it did n't bother you but of course it did			0
' @entity1 finally scored a @entity2 winner with @entity139 's victory in the 2000 @entity140 when @entity139 finally cracked the @entity2 for @entity1 , he knelt down and kissed the turf in the winner 's enclosure that had eluded him it is where he would love to be again and the trainer , who was hit hard by the recession , seeing his string half in number from a high of 150 horses , reckons he is bringing one of his strongest ever teams			1
there is @entity155 in monday 's @entity156 , very @entity157 , winner of last year 's @entity159 , in wednesday 's @entity160 and @entity161 , the ' big white hope ' and rated a future @entity17 contender , in thursday 's @entity164			1
but it is @entity17 that @entity1 seeks most and he reckons he might be on the right road			1
' @entity167 is the form horse but i do n't think there is an awful lot between the @entity30 , ' he said			0
' my horse lost his way as a novice but we always thought stamina would be his forte and no horse was staying on better in the @entity21			0

road to riches will be competing for the @entity17 at @entity2
trainer @entity1 has four @entity2 wins and many more defeats
victory for the @entity25 winner would erase near misses *including* @entity84 and @entity70
