by @entity1 reporter published : 19:10 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 6 march 2013 best - selling tipple @entity2 is scrapping its distinctive bottle shape after almost 40 years ... so that drinkers can keep it in the fridge door			1
the @entity8 cream liqueur has been sold in the instantly recognisable container that is shorter and fatter than a typical bottle of spirits since its 1974 launch			1
but although it can last for up to two years at the back of the drinks cupboard - even after being opened - a growing number of its predominantly female fans like it chilled			1
the new bottle , pictured left , has been heightened and slimmed down so it can fit in the fridge now drinks giant @entity26 , which owns @entity2 along with other brands like @entity28 , has finally decided to change the shape to fit modern demands			1
from this month it will be sold in a slimmer , longer , wine - shaped bottle in its first major revamp since the original launch			2
a £ 1 million publicity campaign to introduce the new look will accompany the launch as fans of the whiskey ( corr ) based tipple , often a @entity42 favourite , get to grips with it			2
alcoholic drinks giant : @entity26 also makes @entity28 and @entity47 vodka @entity26 says the new shape gives it a ‘ stylish and elegant ’ profile but admits : ' it allows it to fit inside a fridge door			1
' the company added the shape would appeal more to the drink ’s huge female fanbase			0
a spokesman said : ' as one of the most - loved female spirits brands in the world , we need to not only to appeal to current @entity2 consumers and adorers , but ensure we also appeal to each new generation of progressive , savvy and spirited women			2
' we have created a beautiful new bottle which is both modern and stylish , with a greater sense of femininity			0
' @entity2 is a brand that appeals specifically and uniquely to women , and through this re-design we embrace and celebrate that timeless appeal in a fresh and contemporary way			0
' the drink does not have to be kept in the fridge , it can last for up to two years with or without being chilled and whether or not it has already been opened			0
but after years of being associated with a largely middle aged , @entity42 market , the brand tried to make itself younger and trendier with expensive ad campaigns encouraging drinkers to try it with ice in			0
now a lot of its younger buyers keep a bottle in the fridge rather than the drinks cupboard .			0
