by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 10:11 est , 12 may 2012 for millions of @entity1 the drought is officially over , swept away by record rainfall			2
nineteen areas in parts of the @entity6 , the @entity7 and the @entity8 were declared drought - free yesterday by the government ’s @entity9			1
however , it has refused to lift the alert for the @entity14 area and @entity15 , despite the fact reservoirs are full to overflowing			1
filling up nicely : @entity17 in @entity18 , a county where hosepipe bans remain in force shrinking fast : the same reservoir two months ago before weeks of rain began to refill it as a result , millions of families who have put up with weeks of downpours still face threat of prosecution for using a hosepipe in the garden or to wash the car			1
@entity1 had 4.8in of rain in april , which was the highest level on records that date back to 1910			1
the downpours have continued into may			0
@entity38 in @entity37 was the wettest place in the country with 10.8in of rain , which was more than three times the average			1
areas no longer in drought include @entity37 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , parts of @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53			1
@entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 are also given the all - clear			1
the status of these areas meant residents and businesses were under threat of a hosepipe ban , although no restrictions had been put in place			2
heavy showers continued to pummel parts of the @entity6 and @entity73 yesterday			1
in the @entity7 , parts of @entity75 were plunged back into winter after snow fell overnight			1
weathermen say many areas will enjoy some relief this weekend with a touch of spring warmth			0
temperatures could read 16c in some areas			0
however , the reprieve will be short - lived , with the rain expected to return by the middle of next week			2
the @entity9 said the heavy rainfall of recent weeks has restored many rivers and reservoirs			1
however , levels of ground water , which is reached through bore holes , are still low in many areas			1
companies that are still officially covered by drought and continue to have a hosepipe ban in force include @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			2
however , there is anger that firms behind the bans are allowing almost a quarter of all treated water to be wasted through leaks in their pipes			2
environment secretary @entity114 yesterday defended the need to maintain hosepipe bans			0
‘ even the record rainfall we had in april and the prediction of more wet weather in may wo n’t make up for the shortages in these areas caused by two extremely dry winters , ’ she said			1
she said it would only be possible to bring the drought to an end in all areas if the country gets several months of very wet weather			2
@entity130 of @entity14 said : ‘ no water company wants to impose restrictions on its customers for any longer than absolutely necessary			1
' we still have a serious groundwater shortage , and we could yet have a long , hot summer , so , much as we ’d love to , it would be irresponsible for us to lift the hosepipe ban just yet			2
’ the @entity9 ’s chief executive , dr @entity139 , said : ‘ low groundwater levels remain a concern across many parts of @entity143 , with many still at a similar level to those in 1976 and unlikely to return to normal levels before the winter			1
’ summer colours : @entity150 takes in the bright scenery at @entity152 , near @entity153 , where heavy downpours have given way to dry spells contrast : the same could not be said for workers on the @entity159 near @entity160 today , where snow swept in during @entity1 's changeable may weather they think it 's eel over : these 3ft fish were spotted on a football pitch in @entity167 today thanks to heavy downpours in north wales something fishy 's going on : the 3ft - long fish were washed onto fields at @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 @entity177 @entity176 said : ' we should see a bit of a break from the heavy rain over the weekend			1
' today will see more of the same for parts of @entity183 and northern @entity143 , with some hill snow in northern @entity183			1
' from @entity186 southwards , there may be one or two showers but a lot of the day will be mainly dry			2
some sunshine will come through which will be welcomed			2
' most of the country will have a fairly good day on saturday			0
there may be the odd showers but many places will be dry with some sunshine			2
' temperatures will range from 12 to 15 degrees , which is n’t brilliant for may but better than it has been			0
by sunday , most of @entity143 and @entity73 should see some pretty good weather			1
' the @entity200 shared their optimism in finally predicting a brighter weekend for @entity1 with temperatures reaching a respectable @entity203			0
a forecast for saturday on their website said : ' a much brighter day generally , with a good deal of sunshine			0
probably somewhat cloudier at times in the afternoon , though			0
' @entity210 has sprung ... for some : this woman enjoys a walk through a rape seed field in @entity215 , @entity18 today lovely view : @entity218 's newest addition to its skyline , the @entity221 tower , can be seen in the background from this rape seed field in @entity18 back to capacity : @entity225 in @entity18 was back at normal levels today after earlier drought conditions left it almost drained what a difference : the same reservoir , @entity17 , in february fell to worryingly low levels rarely seen in winter all seasons : in @entity233 , @entity75 , it was @entity1 summertime in name only as flurries of snow drifted in overnight forecasters had predicted brighter dry spells in parts of @entity143 and @entity73 , but their prediction clearly did n't apply to the @entity243 hills this morning ground to a halt : a team of workers battle to carry on their work in the snowy conditions in @entity160 this morning @entity250 journey : the white stuff continued to come down north of the border today in @entity160 , despite forecasts of sunny spells in @entity143 and @entity73 @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity255 , @entity37 , @entity44 , parts of @entity51 , parts of @entity52 , most of @entity53 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49			1
@entity258 will certainly be welcomed across the @entity1 , as heavy flooding saw bizarre scenes like those in north @entity73 , where downpours caused a football pitch to be invaded by eels			1
the 3ft - long fish were washed onto fields at @entity173 in @entity267 , @entity175 , used by under - 11 teams			0
firefighters in @entity270 were called to a number of localised incidents yesterday including the rescue of 350 sheep and lambs caught out by a flooded river in the @entity277			0
the fire service had also attended reports of flooded properties , mainly in the @entity282 and @entity283 areas			0
there were a number of reports of a flash flood in the village of @entity289 , north of @entity283			0
three of the four @entity9 flood warnings in force across @entity143 and @entity73 were for rivers in @entity270			1
two were on the @entity294 in the @entity296 area and the third was on the @entity298 in the area of @entity300 and @entity301			0
royal approval : the weather held for @entity304 when she attended the @entity305 at @entity306 in @entity307 today @entity200 three day @entity1 weather forecast drenched : a woman gets a real soaking as she walks through @entity218 yesterday ( left ) , while two shoppers do n't let the torrential downpour dampen their spirits ( right ) making a splash : a @entity315 passes through a flooded road in @entity317 , @entity18 , where heavy overnight rain prompted severe weather warning across southern @entity15 yesterday what a washout : glum - faced shoppers trudge around @entity322 , south @entity73 , on a miserable day meteorologists said the flash flooding was likely to have been caused by a narrow band of exceptionally heavy showers which worked its way across the @entity270 region yesterday afternoon			1
mr @entity176 said the band of downpours - only 5 - 10 miles wide in places - combined with the high general rainfall levels seen across the region on tuesday night to produce the exceptional totals			0
he said : ' with that volume of rain coming down , the water just has n’t anywhere to go			1
' mr @entity176 added there were dramatic differences in temperature levels between places caught in the wave of downpours and those just outside			0
he said the @entity270 seaside town of @entity346 , which had 0.3in ( 7mm ) of rain in an hour yesterday afternoon , only saw a high of @entity349 ( @entity350 ) today , whereas at @entity353 , just a few miles down the coast , temperatures hit @entity354 ( @entity355 )			0
the highest rainfall figure was in @entity357 , @entity75 , which saw 1.4in ( 36mm ) in 12 hours yesterday and 2.4in ( 62mm ) in 24 hours			2
mr @entity176 said the narrow band of exceptionally heavy rain had now moved out to the @entity360 and the more general rainy weather was moving towards @entity183			1
while @entity1 has battled through torrential downpours and unrelenting rain in recent weeks , those in @entity363 have been lapping up record conditions of a far more enjoyable variety			2
@entity258 worshippers were spotted in the @entity363 city today basking in temperatures of @entity371 - the warmest day in may for more than 70 years			0
only three days in the last summer have been recorded as warmer in @entity372 , and there has been no rainfall recorded in the city this month			0
lapping it up : two sun seekers top up their tans in @entity372 , where peak temperatures of @entity371 have seen the hottest may day in 70 decades despite being autumn in @entity372 , only three days have been warmer this summer , according to experts @entity381 meteorologist @entity380 told the @entity382 the temperature of @entity371 at @entity384 in @entity372 was the hottest day in may since 1942			0
he said : ' we 've had a high pressure system which has been planted directly overhead , ' mr @entity380 said			0
' that 's brought some sunny skies over the last few days and really allowed surface temperatures to heat up			0
' we 've also had north to northwest winds bringing in that warmth from the interior ... that meant we 're seeing the heat build up over the last few days			0
' surf 's up : @entity396 takes to the waves of @entity398 during the unseasonal weather in @entity372 enjoying the rays : @entity401 gets some colour while sitting in a deck chair at the @entity404 in @entity405 , @entity372			0
