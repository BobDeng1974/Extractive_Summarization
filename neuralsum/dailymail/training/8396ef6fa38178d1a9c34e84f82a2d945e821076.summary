it comes as chancellor @entity32 has been warned he faces a £ 12billion black hole in his deficit reduction plan – the same amount as that lost to the @entity2 scheme			1
following an official review , the ‘ one size fits all ’ it project will be replaced by much cheaper regional initiatives , with hospitals and gps choosing the it system they need			1

it concluded : ‘ the project has not delivered in line with the original intent as targets on dates , functionality , usage and levels of benefit have been delayed and reduced			0
‘ it is not possible to identify a documented business case for the whole of the @entity129 the work is refocused it is hard to see how the perception can ever be shifted from the faults of the past and allowed to progress effectively to support the delivery of effective healthcare			0
