for once the north @entity1 spotlight did n't fall on @entity2 this sunday afternoon			2
after the week they 've had , @entity3 would have been happy to shun the limelight this time			2
ask @entity7 fans prior to kick - off if they 'd rather three points or a @entity11 loss in the @entity13 final and you 'd have been greeted with split responses			1
@entity16 connects with a corner to fire @entity2 in front in the first half as they continue their bid for a top - four finish @entity16 watches as the ball heads for goal as @entity2 take the lead against @entity26 who were suffering from their @entity29 exertions @entity26 goalkeeper @entity30 can only stand and watch , along with the rest of his defence , as the ball trundles into the net @entity16 , content that the ball will cross the line , turns away to celebrate as @entity30 makes a late but unsuccessful attempt to stop it in the end , as arch - rivals @entity11 prepared for their date with destiny at @entity39 , the @entity7 got their win , courtesy of goals from @entity16 and @entity44 , to move four points behind second - placed @entity46			1
but much like their demoralising @entity49 loss to @entity50 on wednesday night , this did n't make for comfortable viewing			2
the 2 - 0 scoreline does n't tell the full story			0
@entity26 dominated large spells of this clash - the @entity56 a bag or nerves until @entity44 's last minute goal			1
nevertheless , while their participation in this year 's @entity49 is under huge threat , their qualification for next year 's competition is firmly on course thanks to this win			2
@entity3 rang the changes following wednesday 's hugely disappointing loss			1
vice captain @entity68 and @entity69 were axed following the loss to @entity50 and replaced by @entity71 and @entity72			0
for @entity71 , in particular , it was a huge chance to cement himself in his manager 's first - team plans			2
@entity68 's role in the starting xi has been called into huge question this season following a string of below - par displays			0
and it seems @entity3 's reached the end of his tether with the @entity86 @entity85 winner after another disappointing display in midweek			1
@entity16 struggled in @entity2 's midweek defeat by @entity50 but showed his delight at the @entity56 after firing the @entity7 in front @entity16 points to the heavens after scoring ( left ) and points to his temple as if to urge @entity2 to maintain their concentration @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity94 7.5 ; @entity95 7 , @entity71 6.5 , @entity96 6.5 , @entity97 6.5 ; @entity98 7 ( @entity99 89 ) , @entity100 7.5 ; @entity72 8 ( @entity44 82 ) , @entity101 6.5 , @entity102 6.5 ( @entity69 87 ) ; @entity16 7 subs not used : @entity104 , @entity68 , @entity105 , @entity106			1
goals : @entity16 39 , @entity44 89 booked : @entity16 , @entity96 manager : @entity3 - 7 @entity26 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity30 6 ; @entity109 7 , @entity110 6.5 , @entity111 6.5 , @entity112 6.5 ; @entity113 7 , @entity114 6.5 ( @entity115 77 ) , @entity116 6.5 ( @entity117 84 ) ; @entity118 6.5 ( @entity119 62 ) , @entity120 7 ; @entity121			1

@entity44 had only been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he fired a deflected effort beyond @entity30 in the @entity26 goal @entity44 was left in acres of space and allowed time to take aim as he made sure the points were staying at the @entity56 @entity44 and @entity16 , @entity2 's two goalscorers , celebrate the former 's strike in the dying minutes against visiting @entity26 a strong display from @entity71 against @entity121 may have heralded new central defensive partnership - alongside @entity96 - for the @entity7 until at least the end of the season			1
but the former @entity159 defender nearly fluffed his lines on his big audition in the 18th minute as he failed to deal with a long - ball to allow @entity121 a free run a @entity164			0
thankfully for the @entity166 , his fellow @entity165 bailed him out with some excellent goalkeeping			0
it did n't impress the @entity7 fans , nor did it his manager who almost saw his central defensive gamble backfire in woeful fashion			2
@entity26 deserved the opening , too , after a confident start at the @entity56			1
left - back @entity112 , 21 , on only his second @entity178 start had made a bright start , while @entity180 and @entity120 were seeing plenty of the ball in midfield			1
@entity2 , on the other hand , started lethargically - lacking any vigour or pace in their play			2
that was until @entity16 missed a guild - edged opportunity to hand @entity2 a 28th - minute advantage			1
having brilliantly escaped the attentions of @entity110 deep inside the penalty area , the @entity192 had time to pick his spot from @entity133 's cross - but the striker sent his close range header wide			0
it was the last thing @entity16 needed after his high - profile misses against @entity50 on wednesday			1
supporters did n't get on his back this time , fans responding to by @entity16 's wastefulness by chanting his name			1
@entity98 was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team - mate before being hit on the face with the ball @entity98 is looked at by medics getting a bloody nose			0
the @entity192 carried on but was later forced off with a suspected broken nose his nose already hurt , @entity98 took another hit when the ball smacked him square in the face as he challenged for it @entity98 's face was left in a mess as his nose bled following the second of two incidents during @entity2 's win over @entity26 @entity3 probably would n't have been quite so understanding on the bench , however , having watched the striker , who he has spoke glowingly of in recent weeks , squander yet another chance			1
the miss , though , did herald a period of sustained pressure from the home side after their slow start			0
however , if @entity71 had n't produced an excellent last - ditch tackle to deny @entity121 in the 38th minute then the growing sense of optimism would have instantly waned			0
the challenge would have made @entity71 feel an awful lot better after his earlier howler			0
and his mood would have improved further when the @entity7 took the lead just a minute later			0
so to did @entity16 , who put his midweek woes behind him to nip in front of @entity241 to flick home @entity101 's corner			1
it was the perfect response after the barracking from his own fans during the defeat to @entity50			0
perhaps it was harsh on @entity26 after a first - half in which , for the most part , they looked comfortable , if not the better side			1
@entity116 tried , spectacularly , to put the @entity26 back on level terms inside five minutes of the restart but sent an acrobatic bicycle kick over the bar			2
@entity112 attempts to drive down the win but his progress is stalled by the intervention of @entity2 defender @entity95 @entity71 was handed a start in the heart of @entity2 's defence and he made his presence felt with this challenge on @entity121 @entity16 puts his head in as @entity26 defender @entity110 stretches his leg out in an attempt to win the ball as @entity2 push forward @entity26 forward @entity118 then saw a penalty appeal rejected by @entity130 , claiming @entity72 had handled in the box			1
much like the first - half , @entity128 's side had made a positive start after the break - @entity112 's delivery from dead - balls causing @entity2 's defence problems			1
the @entity26 boss threw on @entity119 in place of @entity118 in search of a leveller			0
given his @entity11 connections , @entity119 was afforded a horrendous ovation from home supporters			0
there 'd have been more boos in the 65th minute had @entity164 not tipped over @entity121 's first - time shot from @entity120 's cross as @entity26 continued to make life uncomfortable for their hosts			2
it was even more uncomfortable for @entity98 who was left with a bloody nose following an accidental collision with team - mate @entity16			2
he would later be replaced after taking a ball full in the face			0
@entity119 missed a glorious chance to score on his return to the capital , firing straight at @entity94 deep inside the area after great work from @entity109 down the right			0
the @entity56 was a bag of nerves			0
@entity101 should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent through by @entity72 but the @entity86 's shot was blocked by @entity110			0
substitute @entity44 , finally , eased tensions in the 89th minute with a strike from the edge of the area that took a deflection off @entity110 .			0

@entity16 's first - half *volley* fired @entity2 in front after his disappointing *performance* in midweek
@entity44 made sure of the points with a deflected effort in the dying minutes , *shortly* after coming on
@entity2 manager @entity3 dropped per *mertesacker* after the @entity7 were beaten by @entity50
@entity26 struggled to *replicate* their @entity29 form as they failed to pose a threat to the @entity56 side
@entity2 now lie third in the @entity178 table , four points behind defending champions @entity46
