it is perhaps the most bizarre vote of confidence a manager has ever received — the football club owner standing outside of a @entity6 pub joking that the boss is about to be sacked			1
but when @entity10 chief @entity9 told a reporter that @entity12 was ‘ dead , finished and over ’ in @entity13 on thursday night , he was as good as guaranteeing the manager ’s future			1
billionaire @entity9 does not do press interviews and , as his lawyers later insisted , he was ‘ humouring ’ the journalist who approached him while on a night out with friends			1
@entity10 manager @entity12 has been under fire of late with supporters demanding he gets sacked @entity10 owner @entity9 denied he was being serious in saying manager @entity12 could lose his job indeed , sources close to @entity9 insist @entity12 ’s position is not under threat and he will be given time to improve results which see @entity10 bottom of the @entity30 ahead of tomorrow ’s trip to @entity32			1
certainly , @entity12 , 53 , was not fazed by his paymaster ’s comments			1
‘ i think he was trying to be supportive in his own kind of way , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ they [ the comments ] are what they are and unfortunately we have had those sort of headlines for two or three weeks			2
‘ sometimes things are taken out of context			0
if it was a sit - down interview done in a serious manner i ’d be a lot more concerned than i am now , that ’s for sure			0
the focus for me really can only be monday night			1
’ supporters held posters last week making it clear they want @entity12 sacked as @entity10 manager he added : ‘ [ the owner ] is obviously very keen for us to get victories , that ’s what he ’s about			1
that ’s what we ’re about , winning			0
‘ i ’ve been under pressure at this club for a number of weeks now			1
all i can focus on now is the team and that ’s what i ’ll do			0
’ @entity9 had been quoted in @entity67 as saying : ‘ one more game — if we lose against @entity32 on monday night then he ’s gone			1
one more game then that ’s it			0
what would you do ? i have spent a lot of money on that club , it has cost me a lot			0
i wo n’t put up with it any more			0
honestly , answer me , what would you do ? one more loss and he ’s gone , he ’s over , finished			0
’ @entity9 : ' if we lose against @entity32 on monday night then he 's gone			1
over ' but @entity9 ’s lawyers have since maintained : ‘ mr @entity9 responded , tongue in cheek , that mr @entity12 had two more games before being sacked			1
‘ to put this into perspective , over the past few weeks certain reports have stated that they believe that mr @entity12 has two more games before being sacked			1
mr @entity9 was therefore humouring the reporter			1
’ a spirited comeback to draw 2 - 2 with @entity92 last weekend followed by a midweek win at @entity94 in the @entity95 has eased the pressure on @entity12			2
@entity97 came from the bench to score twice against @entity92 , while £ 6million signing @entity99 broke his duck for the club with a double at @entity103			0
and @entity12 says his own mood has been cheered by events of the past week			2
‘ you ’re going to carry some scars so it does change your mood when you get lifts like we ’ve had this week , ’ he said			0
‘ in particular in the striking department we ’ve really had a lift			0
@entity12 was heartened by the 3 - 2 @entity95 win against @entity94 in midweek ‘ we ’ve looked ok in the majority of games and have deserved more points than we have			2
but at the same time we ’ve looked like we ’re not going to score too many goals			0
‘ the lift from the strikers has helped the squad and it will certainly settle us			0
’ it was during a 1 - 0 defeat by @entity32 in april that @entity10 supporters rounded on @entity12 amid his lingering fallout with @entity126 , who eventually joined @entity92 on loan last month			1
again , during @entity10 ’s last away outing in the league — a 4 - 0 defeat by @entity131 — fans called for their manager to go			2
but planned protests in the subsequent home match with @entity92 were muted and the travelling contingent at @entity94 were supportive of the team			2
the @entity138 salvaged a 2 - 2 draw against @entity92 in their last league game , with @entity97 scoring twice ‘ we ca n’t argue with how the fans responded to us at @entity94 , ’ said @entity12			2
‘ if they could replicate that at @entity32 i would be absolutely delighted			2
‘ we ’ve had two morale - boosting displays , the comeback draw against @entity92 and then the win at @entity94 which gives us something to lean on			0
‘ that ’s given us all a lift and we go to @entity32 looking for our first win			0
we must do better than just getting one win , of course , because there are a lot of games to go			0

@entity12 believes @entity10 owner @entity9 was being supportive in a bizarre kind of way after recent comments *emerged* after a night out
@entity9 reportedly told a journalist in regards to @entity12 's future : ' he 's got one more game . if we lose against @entity32 on monday night then he 's gone . i have had enough . dead . finished . over '
@entity9 's lawyers insist he was ' humouring ' the journalist and was not being serious
@entity12 has been under pressure for a number of weeks after a series of poor results and fan protests
