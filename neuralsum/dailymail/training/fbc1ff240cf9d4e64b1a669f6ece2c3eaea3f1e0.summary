by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 10:21 est , 20 december 2012 defeat : @entity1 lost her @entity3 battle to marry in a @entity5 church a bride - to - be has lost her fight to marry in a @entity5 ' church ' after @entity3 judges ruled that it is not a legal place to wed. @entity1 had battled to overturn a refusal by the registrar general of births , deaths and marriages in @entity17 and @entity18 to register the chapel for the solemnisation of marriages on the grounds that it was not ' a place of meeting for religious worship '			1
the 24 - year - old had wanted to wed fellow scientologist fiance @entity28 in a chapel at the church 's @entity31 base in @entity33 , central @entity31			1
she had argued that the decision not to allow her to hold a ceremony there was unlawful religious discrimination			1
but mr @entity38 backed the registrar 's decision and dismissed her case			2
the judge was backed today by communities secretary @entity43 who welcomed the decision			0
the court had been told at an earlier hearing that the chapel would have to be legally certified as a meeting place for religious worship to enable a marriage to take place there			2
miss @entity1 's lawyer @entity53 of @entity54 said that the bride - to - be 's brother @entity55 had been married in a religious ceremony at a @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , in 2007 and that she and her fiance had wanted a similar ceremony			1
but a casework manager for the registrar general said such a wedding could not be recognised because of the 1970 case of @entity67 in the @entity68			2
judges in that case ruled that another @entity5 chapel was not a meeting place for religious worship because its services involved ' instructions in the tenets of a philosophy concerned with man ' and were not concerned with religious worship			1
mr @entity38 said today that he felt bound by that @entity68 ruling			0
he said in a written ruling : ' in my judgment there has been no significant change in the beliefs of @entity87 or in their services since ( that ) decision			0
' ' ( that ruling ) , in the absence of a significant change in the way @entity87 worship , still binds me to hold that they do not worship			0
' but he said the issue should be analysed by the @entity97 - the highest court in the @entity98			1
miss @entity99 and mr @entity28 , both volunteers at the church , had appealed the decision to block the wedding in july last year			1
the case was of particular importance to the @entity58 and its followers as several similar cases have been turned down in court in the past			0
engaged : @entity1 pictured with her fiance @entity28 the case was of particular importance to the @entity58 and its followers as several similar cases have been turned down in court in the past			1
miss @entity1 argued that the 1970 ruling should not be binding on any court because @entity5 beliefs and services had evolved during the past 42 years			1
support : communities secretary @entity43 backed the @entity3 ruling she said services were ' ones of religious worship ' and likened @entity5 to @entity125 and @entity126			1
but she said after the case that she was pleased that the @entity97 may take a different view of her case			1
she said : ' i knew i would have to be strong and patient given the current law			0
' i am delighted that the court has granted me the opportunity to ask the @entity97 to hear my case			2
' i hope that the court allows me to marry in my own church , surrounded by my family and friends , which means everything to me			0
' her solicitor , @entity140 , who works for law firm @entity142 , said : ' it has always felt wrong that , simply because she is a member of the @entity58 , @entity1 has been denied the right given to @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity125 , @entity126 and other faiths to have a legal marriage ceremony in accordance with her own religious beliefs and in her own church			1
' he added : ' @entity1 is determined to see the process through to achieve this basic right			2
' communities secretary @entity43 said the @entity58 might have been entitled to ' tax breaks ' - because of rules governing places of public worship - had a decision gone in its favour			0
he welcomed mr @entity38 â€™s ruling and said taxpayers would not want ' such a controversial organisation ' to get ' special ' treatment			0
believers : actors @entity168 , left , and @entity169 , right , are both followers of @entity5 officials at the @entity171 said places of public worship could be exempted from paying business tax rates			2
and mr @entity43 , conservative mp for @entity175 and @entity176 , added : ' i welcome this ruling			0
tolerance and freedom of expression are important @entity98 values , but this does not mean that the likes of @entity58 deserve favoured tax treatment			0
he said the @entity58 was not a registered charity and went on : ' the majority of the public would not want their own council to be giving special tax breaks to such a controversial organisation			0
' @entity5 is a controversial religious belief system that teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature			2
famous scientologists include actors @entity169 and @entity168 .			0

@entity1 , 24 , lost her appeal to be allowed to marry @entity28
the pair want to wed at @entity5 's @entity98 base in central @entity31
miss @entity1 had argued that she was a victim of ' religious discrimination '
but a *precedent* set in 1970 saw judges *uphold* the *ban* on the marriage
the pair could now take their case to the @entity97
