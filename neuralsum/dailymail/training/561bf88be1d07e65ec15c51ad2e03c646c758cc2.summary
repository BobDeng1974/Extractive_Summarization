rivals to @entity1 have seen a huge rise in traffic after file - sharing site @entity1 was shut down by the @entity5 and its flamboyant founder arrested in a high - profile raid			1
after the @entity5 shut down file - sharing site @entity1 and charged staff such as flamboyant founder @entity10 - formerly @entity10 - with copyright violations , users have flocked to rivals such as @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
if the @entity17 authorities hoped that the move would dent the popularity of such ' cyber-locker ' sites which are mainly used for sharing music and video for free they have been very much mistaken			2
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity25 , have reaped the rewards of the arrest of @entity1 's ' pirate captain ' @entity10			1
one site , @entity25 , which has 2.5bn page views per month , is now twice the size @entity1 was before it shut down and the others have seen the numbers using their services nearly doubled			1
the high life : @entity10 , formerly known as @entity10 and nicknamed ' dr evil ' , was arrested along with three other executives of @entity38 on friday taken down : the @entity1 homepage boasted the endorsement of a string of high - profile celebrities @entity15 is currently the subject of legal action in @entity45 , with a firm , @entity46 , seeking to reveal the identities of individuals who uploaded and shared confidential documents			1
the ' cyberlocker ' sites let users store large files and download them from anywhere			2
@entity1 , which the @entity17 government shut down , was a @entity56 - based ‘ cyberlocker ’ service that allegedly allowed users to download pirated films , tv shows , music and e-books with just a few clicks			1
it is accused of costing copyright owners £ 322million in lost earnings and of making £ 113million by selling advertising and premium subscriptions			0
a graphic created by web - monitoring firm @entity68 showing the leap in traffic to ' cyberlocker ' sites @entity14 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity13 the traffic surge following @entity1 's closure is an embarrassment to many of the firms involved as it shines an unwelcome spotlight on how they operate			1
such sites are keen to emphasise their legality in the wake of @entity1 's difficulties			2
' this case has a great negative impact on file storage services and the internet overall , ' a @entity15 spokesman said			0
' 4shared has some of the most strict house rules among all other file storage services and there ’s no need for any changes			0
' cyberlocker sites are legal , and operate in the same way as @entity98 - in that they take down illegal files whenever told to by copyright holders			2
as with @entity98 , the volume of files means that every upload can not be manually inspected			0
@entity1 is accused of knowingly violating copyright			2
several @entity1 staff were arrested in @entity106 last week on copyright charges			0
the @entity5 also allege that the site was used for money - laundering			0
its founder , ' @entity10 ' - formerly @entity10 - owned a £ 3million collection of 25 cars which was confiscated at the time of his arrest – mainly top - of - the range @entity117 with number plates such as ‘ stoned ’ , ‘ @entity120 ’ and ‘ guilty ’ but also including @entity122 , a vintage pink @entity125 and @entity10 ’s runabout , a £ 300,000 @entity126 with the number plate ‘ god ’			0
luxury : the property in @entity131 , near @entity132 , @entity106 , which was raided today as part of the operation against the founder and executives of file - sharing site @entity1 lapping in luxury : dotcom splashes out in the @entity140 with a mystery woman			1
@entity10 was also in a film posted online enjoying a ' crazy weekend ' on a superyacht in @entity144 said to have cost millions lavish : dotcom also had a garish pink cadillac in his collection of luxury cars , which was also seized by police confiscated : others cars including a collection of @entity117 vehicles were removed from the @entity10 's home although music stars such as @entity155 and @entity156 have supported @entity1 , film and record companies say the seven - year - old file - sharing site is making a fortune off their work without paying them a penny			1
@entity164 film companies have been the main victims of piracy			0
the seven accused @entity1 executives – including two other @entity168 and a @entity169 also seized in @entity106 – are each charged with five counts of racketeering , copyright infringement and conspiracy , and could be jailed for up to 20 years			0
in the dock : megaupload executive @entity178 der @entity180 , left , @entity181 , second from left , @entity175 and founder , former ceo and current chief innovation officer @entity10 , right , appear in @entity182 in @entity132 , @entity106			0
