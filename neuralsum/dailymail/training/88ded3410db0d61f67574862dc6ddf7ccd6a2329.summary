a prestigious @entity1 art school confiscated a fridge full of sperm from a student 's art show after deciding it was a health and safety risk			1
' take this sperm and @entity8 ' involved @entity9 displaying 68 vials of his semen in a fridge and inviting visitors to take a vial home with them from @entity17 's @entity16			1
@entity9 said that the vials represented ' creation , parenting , desire , masculinity , fantasy , and reality ' , but his art school was less than impressed , calling it ' bio-hazardous waste ' health hazard : artist @entity9 's art work involving giving away sperm to the public did not impress his art school @entity9 , a 23 - year old student , said that he took precautions before his debut last friday , agreeing to microwave the samples before displaying them to the public : ' the semen is dead			1
the swimmers are not swimming '			0
@entity9 protested that he had shown the work many times in class and that there was ' plenty of bio-hazardous work in the art world ' in any case			2
i 've been working on this for months , ' @entity9 complained to the @entity48			0
the day after the fridge went on show , @entity9 received an e-mail from the art school 's director of environmental health and safety , @entity54			1
@entity54 said that after he had checked with a biomedical scientist , he realised that there was ' no way to ensure the sperm samples would be 100 percent free of pathogens			0
' he added : ' in order to protect the public we will need to secure the refrigerator until i can arrange to have the sperm samples disposed of as hazardous biowaste			0
' the semen was then quarantined as a health hazard in an administrator 's office until a waste - management firm could dispose of it			0
eventually the university called off the professional disposal after @entity9 claimed it was censorship			0
the art school and @entity9 reached a compromise by agreeing that the refrigerator would be sealed and the vials would not be available to take away			1
@entity9 's work also proved controversial last year when he paraded around @entity1 dressed as @entity81 , for a piece entitled ' @entity83 of @entity84 ' .			2
