@entity0 had her @entity3 co-hosts all rallied against her during a discussion in which she supported a highly controversial discipline technique in the third episode of the revamped series wednesday			2
with @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 all shaking their heads in abject disapproval , @entity0 sided with a @entity15 dad who recently forced his 4 - year - old son to humiliate himself on a roadside with a sign that read ' i hit little girls			1
' ' that father took a great step and i 'm proud of him , ' @entity0 said of the man who could lose custody of his son for the stunt			0
' he 's a little kid , ' the actress asserted , raising her signature voice for one of the first times since joining the show			0
' he 's 4 - years - old , it 's a little bit extreme			1
' @entity0 would n't back down , though , so former @entity45 aide @entity8 put in her two - cents			1
' i do n't think you teach a kid a lesson by shaming , ' said the communications maven			0
then , as if to make amends for the rift that emerged between them on tuesday , a miracle happened : resident fiery liberal @entity9 agree with @entity55			1
' shame is never a way to teach a child anything ' said @entity9 , whose own special - needs son once grappled with a hitting problem before the family sought therapy			2
' they 're not emotionally ready to understand			0
' but even in an episode where the panel touched on the @entity67 child abuse issue and selfies in the gynecologist 's office , day three was a departure from day two when @entity55 and @entity9 shared some seriously tens disagreement : it was @entity0 's turn to anger the group on wednesday as she sided with a father with some controversial thoughts on displinine @entity0 agreed : the creative punishment used by @entity35 ( right ) when he discovered his son @entity37 had been harassing female classmates became a source of a classic @entity82			1
@entity8 and both @entity83 said 4 - year - old is too young to humiliate a child the once - booted co-host compared a characterization @entity55 made of @entity89 's lack of warmth with the ' international incident ' that came when rapper @entity92 publicly declared that @entity45 's response ( or lack thereof ) to the @entity96 disaster meant he hated black people			1
' he revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement , ' @entity55 said of her then boss , who wrote of his dismay over @entity102 's assertion in his 2010 memoir decision points			2
she then called @entity9 's words ' an attack			0
' @entity9 snatched the opportunity to turn @entity55 's words against her			1
' he was very upset in the plane as he flew over @entity96 , ' quipped the comedienne			0
' it was a very long time before he showed up			0
that is a fact , not an attack			0
' @entity55 , who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with @entity45 's decision not to visit @entity96 -- but simply fly over it -- was forced to agree			1
ironically , on the season 's same inaugural episode , @entity9 made sure to say of @entity55 : ' i like her , i swear ! ' whether that 's true or not , the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked , at least for the time being			2
the season 15 premier on monday won the show its highest ratings in eight years			0
according to @entity130 , it 's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series			0
more to come ? @entity132 @entity8 and liberal @entity9 traded some harsh words during a very tense moment on just the second episode of @entity3 's new lineup			1

@entity8 and both @entity83 said ' no way ! ' to @entity0 's siding with @entity15 dad who punished 4 - year - old by forcing him to hold shameful sign in public
day 3 of the revamped look and lineup , with *guests* @entity147 and @entity149 , was tamer by far than day 2
on tuesday , @entity8 and @entity9 seriously butted heads over @entity55 's boss @entity45 's response to @entity96
