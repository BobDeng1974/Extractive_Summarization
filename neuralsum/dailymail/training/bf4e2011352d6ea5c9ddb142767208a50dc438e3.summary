by @entity0 after a near - fatal cycling accident , the @entity1 swung into action to save @entity4 – with surgery on her pelvis , jaw , knees and her wrist			1
but when it came to the final procedure , having her six front teeth replaced , the 20 - year - old was stunned to be told she might have to foot the bill because getting her smile back would count as a cosmetic procedure			1
the advertising assistant was left in a coma for a week after being hit by a car when she was cycling back from work in november last year			0
@entity4 , 20 , from @entity23 lost six of her teeth in a cycling accident , before and after images are shown left to right			1
@entity29 told @entity30 her teeth were not restored because the procedure is n't regarded as ' acute care ' and she is waiting to see if payment for the £ 12,000 treatment will be approved doctors managed to save her life and she made a full recovery from a broken pelvis , a snapped jaw , two dislocated knees and a broken wrist – but was sent home with six of her teeth still missing			1
she is now facing an anxious wait to see if the @entity1 will approve payment for the treatment – and claims the only way to get it sooner would be to fork out £ 12,000 of her own money			1
she said : ‘ i read in magazines all the time about people who have boob jobs , nose jobs and other cosmetic surgery on the @entity1 because their confidence needs boosting			0
‘ yet nobody seems to understand how awful it is to have no front teeth at my age			0
‘ i did n’t mean this to happen and i did n’t just go to the doctor and say i had a lack of self - confidence and so needed some teeth			0
‘ i had been in an accident and you would think it would be a priority for them to help me			0

she broke her pelvis , snapped her jaw and was in a coma for a week following the collision last november			1
miss @entity30 claims she has been unfairly treated , while the @entity1 prioritise boob jobs and tummy tucks a private dentist has offered to perform the procedure for free , if @entity30 , pictured here with her friend @entity79 , will pay for the materials			2
miss @entity30 said she had been initially led to believe her treatment would be carried out for free , but was told it would n't be at a follow - up appointment miss @entity30 had been led to believe her treatment would be carried out for free when she was transferred to @entity29 two weeks after her accident			1
miss @entity30 , pictured , who previously wore braces to perfect her smile , claims the news has left her heartbroken but when she went for a follow - up appointment with a maxillofacial expert she was told that she could have to foot the bill for future treatment herself			2
with permanent implants costing around £ 2,000 per tooth , she said she began to wonder whether her smile would ever get back to normal			0
miss @entity30 , from @entity23 , @entity94 , has now been offered a discounted rate by a local dentist – but would still have to come up with the money for the materials herself			2
she said the loss of her teeth had left her devastated , adding : ‘ i had braces for two years and when they came off they made my teeth really white			0
‘ everyone used to love my teeth , but the braces seem like a bit of a waste now			0
‘ i do n’t want to be keeping my teeth in a glass next to the sink when i ’m only 20			0
’ a spokesman for @entity29 confirmed that replacing miss @entity30 ’s teeth was ‘ not classified as acute care ’ – and that patients were therefore normally advised to consult their dentist			1
however he went on to say that she was still on the waiting list for a surgical appointment at the hospital to discuss future dental treatment			0
a spokesman for @entity29 , pictured , said patients are normally advised to consult their dentist , yet added miss @entity30 has an appointment to discuss her teeth : ' unfortunately there is a waiting list , ' said the spokesman , ' but we can assure @entity4 she has not been abandoned by the @entity1 ' he added : ‘ we saw @entity4 in our maxillofacial department in january and referred her to our consultant in surgery to assess what can be done for her in the long term from a restorative perspective			1
‘ unfortunately there is a waiting list for these appointments but we can assure @entity4 that the wheels are in motion and that she has not been abandoned by the @entity1			2
