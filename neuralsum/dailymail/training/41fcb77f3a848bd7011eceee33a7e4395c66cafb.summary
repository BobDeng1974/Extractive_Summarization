by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 7 august 2013 on trial : @entity2 and @entity3 outside @entity4 where they accused of stealing more than £ 100,000 from her godmother a couple stole the life savings of an elderly godmother to buy a new car and build a gym and wet room for their home , a court heard			1
@entity3 and her husband @entity2 are said to have pilfered more than £ 100,000 from 91 - year - old @entity17 to fund their lavish home improvements			1
the pensioner , who is mrs @entity3 ’s godmother , was left with no money to pay her own bills , @entity4 heard			1
the pair , from @entity24 , took over mrs @entity17 ’s finances when the spinster was taken into a care home in 2009 with dementia			1
they are accused of milking her bank account dry and cashing in her benefits for themselves			0
prosecutor @entity33 told the court how mrs @entity17 was left without pocket money while her goddaughter , 56 , and mr @entity37 , 55 , spent her savings within just two years			1
more than £ 11,000 went on paying off mrs @entity3 ’s credit card bill while the couple also bought a car , revamped their £ 220,000 detached home and added new furniture			1
when they were arrested last year , they claimed the garage conversion on the four - bedroom property was being carried out so that the pensioner could move in with them when she recovered			0
but a planning application submitted to the council detailed installing a gym and a wet room – and made no mention of a bedroom			0
opening the case , barrister mr @entity33 told the jury : ‘ the prosecution say that this money was taken from her account in order for them to spend it on themselves			2
' the prosecution say the money was used to pay for the conversion at their house			0
and also used by the defendants to buy a car , furnishings and electrical equipment			0
‘ we ask you to look at this woman ’s mental health			0
building work : the property where the @entity81 proposed the garage conversion would be carried out			0
however a planning application was said to have detailed installing a gym and a wet - room - and made no mention of a bedroom for a pensioner ‘ it shows she was vulnerable and suffering from a gradual deterioration in her capacity due to the onset of dementia			2
‘ the prosecution say both defendants must have been well aware of this and decided to take advantage of her vulnerability by taking and spending her life savings			1
’ the court heard that mrs @entity17 had ‘ substantial ’ savings of more than £ 130,000 in january 2009 , but within two years there was just over £ 3,000 left in her accounts			1
council officials launched an investigation after realising the care home resident was often left without pocket money and did not have enough to meet her bills			0
mr @entity37 twice ignored letters to provide detailed bank statements , said mr @entity33 , because he knew there was little left and the discovery of that could lead to police involvement			2
soon after , small amounts of money were transferred back into the pensioner ’s accounts in a cynical attempt to hide the thefts , the prosecutor said			0
' taking advantage ' : there was regular spending by the couple at @entity130 ( left ) , @entity132 ( right , both file pictures ) and @entity133 , funded by @entity134 , the court was told case : the couple are accused at @entity4 ( pictured ) of stealing almost £ 95,000 from @entity17 's savings after mr @entity37 became a co-signatory for her accounts when her mental health began to deteriorate after their arrests , the couple denied acting dishonestly and claimed they had been given permission by the woman to spend the money			1
mr @entity33 said their victim had no close relatives visiting her and although her goddaughter was not a blood relative , she and her husband were in line to inherit almost all of her possessions anyway			0
but he told the jury it was ‘ no coincidence ’ that transfers back into the godmother ’s account began only after the @entity81 were told of the council investigation			2
the court also heard that within weeks of the woman being taken into temporary care , her home was stripped of a stairlift and warden alarms despite mr @entity37 being told she may return			1
the house was then let by the couple who had the rent and payment for utility bills paid directly into their accounts along with the elderly woman ’s pension and winter fuel allowance			2
the @entity81 deny four joint charges of theft			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
