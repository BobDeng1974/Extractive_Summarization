by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 07:30 est , 13 march 2014 @entity3 attorney general @entity2 is backing calls for reduced sentences for certain drug offences in order to unclog the federal prison system , which has been overpopulated for years			1
@entity2 hopes the new plan will reduce the vast prison population by 6,500 inmates over the next five years			1
later today , he is due to deliver a statement before the @entity13 that sentences will still be very tough for violent criminals while he attempts to finds ways to cut costs in the prison system			1
@entity3 attorney general @entity2 has been campaigning for the sentence reductions for low - level drug offences as a part of @entity22 's ' @entity24 ' initiative , which hopes to cut costs in the prison system under the proposed plan , the average sentence for drug trafficking could drop from the regularly proposed 62 months to as low as 51 months			1
this means the plan could eventually lead to cut prison sentences for drug convicts by an average of nearly a year , according to the @entity35			1
the change would affect around 70 per cent of those sentenced for federal drug trafficking offences			0
@entity2 's move is part of @entity22 's ' smart on @entity24 ' initiative platform which he has touted since 2013			0
in a joint effort between conservative lawmakers and governors , the attorney general has been vocal in backing reduced reliance on prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders			2
drug trafficking offences are the most common reasons for incarceration at a federal prison , and @entity2 hopes that by changing sentencing legislation regarding drug trafficking sentences he might reduce the prison sentence by 6,500 in five years in extracts of his statement , due to be delivered later today , he says : ' this overreliance on incarceration is not just financially unsustainable -- it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate			1
' however , it is likely these reforms will be enacted on a case by case basis , with only certain non-violent offenders getting consideration for leniency			0
those with charges involving small or moderate amounts of drugs may face a reduction in their sentences , but those involved with large amounts of drugs will not benefit			0
the federal prison system has been drastically over-clogged for a good period of time , with the @entity3 housing 25 per cent of all the world 's criminals the @entity13 wo n't vote on the move until april , but in the meantime @entity2 will be instructing federal prosecutors not to oppose defense motions seeking lower sentences for drug charges - as per his proposal			1
for now , most federal judges sentence within the guidelines range , with 2005 legislation from the @entity96 ruling that judges must consider recommended sentences , but do not have to necessarily follow it			0
the ' smart on @entity24 ' imitative seeks to reduce the federal prison population , along with the costs that come with it , while still preserving public safety			0
the initiative focuses on crime diversion programs , as well as more advanced drug and veteran courts , as well as attempting to draft new criminal charges for low - level drug offenders that do not trigger mandatory federal prison sentences - which clog up the prison system			1
@entity2 said in a statement last year : ' too many @entity3 go to too many prisons for far too long and for no truly good law enforcement reason			0
' if the vote is successful and the new sentencing guidelines are approved , prisoners who have already been sentenced that would be eligible for a smaller sentence will be able to apply for re-sentencing			2
@entity2 's plan has come after months of debating about the overcrowding in the @entity3 federal prison system , which many agreed needed to be drastically dealt with , but with nobody really sure which tactic to pursue			2
previous proposals included a review of sentence disparities , such as those between white males and black males ( black male offenders often received 20 per cent longer sentences that white male offenders committing the same crimes ) , improving counseling and rehabilitation programs to reduce re-offenders , and compassionate early release of elderly members of federal prisons			2
the proposal to change mandatory jail time for drug charges was endorsed by @entity147 criminal defense attorney , who said in august 2013 : ' we need to get rid of the mandatory sentencing system , even if the policy changes federal law ; states handle the vast majority of drug cases			0

@entity2 says reducing drug sentencing would unclog prisons
he hopes to reduce prison populations by 6,500 inmates in 5 years
proposed plan would cut sentences for low level offenders
the @entity13 might vote on the initiative in april
if successful , those sentenced might be able to apply for *shorter* terms
