smiling again : @entity1 after she had reconstructive surgery to fix her nose a second time @entity5 booked a cosmetic surgeon to straighten out her ‘ bumpy ’ nose			1
but her botched operation left her with even more bumps			1
she later found he had a record of botched operations and had been temporarily struck off			1
beauty therapist @entity1 , 51 , had disliked her nose all her life			1
she took the advice of a client who was a nurse and booked an appointment to see surgeon @entity17 at his @entity19 clinic			1
it turned out he was the nurse ’s boss			2
@entity1 ’s consultation with mr @entity17 lasted less than ten minutes			2
he claimed that he could fix her nose without breaking it and with minimal bruising			1
he told her it would heal within a week			1
‘ that was all the time i could take off work so it sounded fine , ’ says @entity1			1
believing mr @entity17 to be an expert , @entity1 decided to go ahead			2
but alarm bells rang the next time they met			2
just minutes before the operation mr @entity17 told @entity32 that he would also be changing the tip of her nose			1
‘ i told him that was n’t what i had asked for			2
he had drawn markings on my nose and it was only when i argued with him that he suddenly scribbled new markings across my nose			1
’ the £ 3,400 procedure was carried out in 2009 in an operating theatre at the back of an office block in @entity48			1
afterwards @entity1 had to walk to the recovery room and just half an hour later , with bloody gauze to hold under her nose , she was sent home			1
‘ i was still bleeding heavily and was given a lift home by the nurse			2
it was traumatic to say the least			2
’ a week later @entity1 , from @entity56 , @entity57 , discovered that underneath her gauze lay a broken nose , with more bumps than it had before			1
‘ i had a bump on the bridge where he had broken my nose and a bigger bump lower down			1
the original bump had also moved			2
' i felt really disappointed but mr @entity17 quickly said it was swollen , it would settle down and i would have to come back in to have it be rasped down further			2
' i ’d never had an operation like this before so i did n’t know what to expect , and believed him			2
i thought it would all be ok			2
’ broken and scarred : @entity1 's nose after the bad surgery in 2009 which cost her £ 3,400 over the following week @entity32 ’s nose began to collapse			1
‘ i was really upset and worried			0
i went back to him but he said i should come back after six months to a year , to allow it to heal first			0
i was distraught , it looked horrendous			0
’ @entity1 sought a second opinion from another @entity57 - based plastic surgeon , @entity85 , who told her the nose would need rebuilding and to demand a refund			1
but mr @entity17 ’s clinic refused to give her money back			0
‘ i was angry and devastated with the way my face looked			0
i did n’t want mr @entity17 to perform any more operations on my nose			1
there was no way i would let him near me			0
’ @entity1 sought legal help from medical negligence experts @entity100 and discovered mr @entity17 had been struck off by the @entity101 in 2003 for botched penis enlargement operations			1
he had appealed and was given a three month suspension and allowed to return to work in 2004			1
@entity1 says : ‘ i felt so stupid			0
i should have checked him out before			0
’ last year , mr @entity17 agreed to pay a five - figure sum to @entity32			0
since then she has had £ 4,247 reconstructive surgery carried out by mr @entity85			1
‘ it has been a nightmare , ’ she says			0
‘ i ca n’t believe mr @entity17 was allowed to operate again after being struck off			1
’ mr @entity17 said due to patient confidentiality , he could not comment			0
there are key questions you must ask your cosmetic surgeon before booking an operation , says @entity114 , president elect of @entity115			1
a good surgeon will ideally give the answers below			1
q are you on the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) specialist register ? a yes			0
those offering surgery should be on the register , for which there are stringent rules			1
they must have done the requisite training and have passed a specialist exam			0
go to gmc - uk.org and enter the surgeon ’s name			1
it will give their @entity101 reference number , date of registration and speciality			0
they do n’t have to be plastic surgeons – but they should have relevant experience			0
for example @entity139 ( ear , nose and throat ) surgeons can perform rhinoplasty ( nose jobs )			1
overseas surgeons must be on the @entity101 register			0
if not , they are working illegally in the @entity148			0
q how many procedures like mine do you carry out ? a more than 20 a year			0
statistically , a surgeon performing this number gets a better outcome			1
breast reduction and uplifts are counted as the same surgery			1
@entity158 how long have you been performing the procedure ? a five years is a reasonable amount of experience and the ideal answer			0
if not , the surgeon needs to show sufficient training or have a mentor to vouch for them			1
q what are the risks involved with this kind of surgery ? a it depends on the health of the individual and the nature of the surgery			1
risks are based on a surgeon ’s assessment of your physical and mental health			2
q what is your complication rate for this procedure ? a under five per cent			0
more than this for any procedure is concerning and would need to be explained			0
q what is the likely outcome – will it meet my expectations ? a yes			0
you should be given a realistic idea of what to expect			0
many surgeons will show before - and - after shots of their work			2
@entity158 do you have appropriate insurance in the @entity148 ? a yes			0
i recommend going to a big hospital group such as @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 or @entity207			0
the practitioners are independent and have their own insurance – usually between £ 3million and £ 10million , without which they ca n’t practice			2
q does the cost i am paying now cover all aftercare ? a yes			0
you need to confirm the cut - off point in terms of timing			0
i – and many reputable surgeons – will give a cut - off point of a year , after which you may be required to pay for any further treatment			0
other companies may only give you three months			0
@entity223 looks after me if something goes wrong at the time and i need further treatment ? a we do			0
if there is an acute problem , the surgeon who performed the operation and the hospital should look after you at no extra cost to yourself .			2

@entity5 , 51 , paid £ 3,400 for a nose job in 2009 to fix her ' bumps '
a week after the surgery she lifted the gauze to discover a broken nose
the surgeon had *previously* been struck off , but allowed to return to work
