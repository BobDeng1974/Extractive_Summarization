by @entity0 published : 10:35 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 16:19 est , 17 february 2013 these breathtaking images capture the spectacular display by thousands of starlings swamping over the seaside			2
at least 50,000 of the birds are thought to make up the ever moving dark cloud performing an aerial dance across the evening sky			1
the stunning photographs of the murmurations were taken at sunset by photographer @entity12 over the past two months			1
aerial dance : at least 50,000 starlings are thought to make up the murmurations above the @entity16 , in @entity17 breathtaking spectacle : the evening sky provides a stunning backdrop for the ever moving dark cloud of starlings love birds : the swarming starlings add to the romance for a couple enjoying a sunset walk by the sea the huge gatherings are largest in the winter , when their numbers are boosted by birds from @entity32 migrating for the milder climate			1
mr @entity12 used a @entity35 camera to photograph the flocks above @entity16 in @entity17			1
he said : ' it 's very unusual and unique to see starlings in a city as they 're normally found in more rural areas			0
' it 's such a treat to be able to go to the peer every day and see them roost there			0
i get drawn to them			0
i think it would be impolite to not go and photograph them			0
' there must be at least 50,000			2
it 's certainly a sight to see			0
i 'm entranced by them and evening they perform a different display			0
is it a bird ? the gatherings are largest in the winter , when the numbers are boosted by birds from @entity32 red sky at night : the birds gather for safety in numbers , to keep warm and exchange information on feeding entranced : the murmurations can be hypnotic and often attract a large number of tourists ' i could never get tired of them , they really help to unwind after a stressful day too			1
' the only issue is that they relieve themselves everywhere , it 's very often that you 're at the other end unfortunately			0
' mr @entity12 has been a photographer for 32 years and specialises in theatre and film , but said that he can not resist the spectacle of the the birds			1
the 55 - year - old @entity84 added : ' you can stand within feet of them , they fly past your face			0
' it 's a tourist attraction and sometimes there are more people than birds			2
it really is one of life 's little experiences			0
' a sight to behold : ' i could never get tired of them , they really help to unwind after a stressful day too ' decline : the spectacle is becoming less common , with the population of starlings dropping 70 per cent tourist attraction : photographer @entity12 said sometimes there are more people at the pier than birds the @entity107 said starlings join forces in such a fashion for safety in numbers from predators such as peregrine falcons that find it hard to target one bird amidst a hypnotising flock of thousands			1
the birds , which have very precise timing , also gather to keep warm and exchange information on feeding areas			2
@entity107 's @entity122 said : ' in many cases they are like clockwork â€“ you know that at a certain time in the evening the sky will start to turn black , and it 's mesmerising watching the flock grow and grow			1
' but the charity also said that such spectacles are becoming less and less common , with the starling population dropping more than 70 per cent , leaving them on the critical list of @entity136 birds most at risk			1
the decline is thought to be caused by a loss of permanent pasture , increased use of farming chemicals and shortage of food and nesting sites			0
life through a lens : photographer @entity12 has been taking pictures of the birds for the past two months @entity150 : ' they are like clockwork , you know at a certain time in the evening the sky will start to turn black ' at risk : the population decline is caused by a loss of permanent pasture and shortage of nesting sites			2
