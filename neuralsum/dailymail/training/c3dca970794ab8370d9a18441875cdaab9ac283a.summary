@entity34 ( right ) and @entity44 ( left ) faced the court after £ 33,000 was plundered from the star 's account mr @entity2 , who is famed for his ability to predict events including the winning lottery numbers , was only alerted it might be her after receiving a handwritten letter casting doubt on the honesty of his cleaners			1
however but it took police almost a year to make an arrest despite the fact that she was always the ‘ prime suspect			2
’ @entity62 star mr @entity2 joked afterwards : ' i suppose i should have seen this coming			1
' the court heard the cleaner may have done it out of revenge when she was made redundant after working for mr @entity2 for seven years			1
but @entity69 , defending , claimed the parting between the pair had been ‘ amicable ’ and said her only motive was money			1
he told the court : ' she has two businesses			2
they were struggling due to a loss of a sum of money which was stolen			1
this was reported to police			2
' she was under a degree of pressure in terms of finances and she succumbed to that pressure			0
she had the opportunity to take two cheques and she did so			1
for that she is extremely sorry			0
' she is genuinely sorry for what she has done			0
she felt once she had done she was trapped and could not see an escape out of it			0
' the barrister said @entity34 , who was a regular customer in her shop , told her he was interested in buying cheques which he would use as guarantees so she passed them on to him			1
but he claimed his client never received any money from the amount that was cashed by @entity34			1
however judge @entity106 said he believed that was a ‘ self - serving untruth			0
’ he said : ' until you pleaded guilty you have lied throughout this case and it is plain you have continued to lie			0
' he added he did not accept her expressions of remorse and said : ' they are quite inconsistent with your conduct throughout this case			0
no doubt you regret being caught but in my judgment nothing more			0
