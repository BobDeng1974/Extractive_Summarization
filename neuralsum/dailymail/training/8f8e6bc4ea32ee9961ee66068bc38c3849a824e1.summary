the @entity11 confirmed that the 42 - year - old had been appointed to the post on a one - year rolling contract			0
the position had been vacant since @entity16 was sacked on monday following a turbulent 15 - game spell at the helm			2
@entity5 has been named as the new @entity4 manager on a one - year rolling contract chairman @entity21 had stressed the need for the club to quickly appoint a successor with @entity10 experience and @entity5 certainly fits the bill having managed for two seasons in the division at @entity29 , with whom he finished 12th and 21st			1
however , the midlands outfit moved on from @entity5 last week following a poor run of results that had seen them win just twice this season , only one more victory than @entity32 managed in his short stint			1
@entity5 told the club 's official website : ' i am absolutely delighted			2
the main objective is to try and keep the club in the championship and build from there			0
it is a big challenge because of our position in the league but it 's a challenge that can be overcome			0
' it 's one that if we achieve what we set out to achieve , which is to stay in the league , it will be a tremendous feat by the whole group			0
i 'm very confident with the players i 've got here , in what we can do going forward , that we can achieve those goals			0
' @entity5 replaces @entity16 who was sacked as @entity4 boss on monday following a turbulent spell at the club @entity5 takes over a club bottom of the @entity10 , seven points adrift of safety already , and with a mere four wins to their credit since last november			1
he managed to save @entity9 from relegation in dramatic circumstances last season , when two goals in the final 12 minutes at @entity70 prevented them from slipping into the third tier			0
@entity32 's status as @entity4 's manager had looked highly precarious well before @entity75 eventually pulled the plug on his time in charge this monday			2
rumblings of discontent had been circulating for months with the two clashing over player recruitment following a summer of inexplicable inactivity at @entity84 , and the point of no return appeared to be reached when then - @entity87 boss @entity86 was openly offered the job in september			0
@entity86 turned down the opportunity , though , and was this week confirmed as @entity9 's new manager following @entity5 's exit			1
