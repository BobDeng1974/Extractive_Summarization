by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 16 may 2013 one of the youngest victims of the @entity3 paedophile ring has accused @entity4 of lying about the support it has offered to her and her family			1
the girl , who was first abused at 13 by the gang , who threatened to cut the head off the baby she had by one of them , says she was repeatedly let down by social services , despite their claiming they were ' closely involved ' in supporting her			1
the accusation comes as seven men were found guilty at the @entity23 of a catalogue of offences including conspiracy to rape , child prostitution and trafficking over an eight - year period in the university city of @entity3			1
police and social workers have apologised to their victims for failing to rescue the vulnerable schoolgirls who were plucked from the streets and care homes to be drugged , raped and sold into prostitution			2
the woman , known as girl c to protect her anonymity , said that her adoptive mother begged social services for help in 2004 but agencies failed to help			2
two years later the council agreed to put her in a temporary care home , but by then she had fallen under the control of the gang , who plied her with crack cocaine			1
she said that when she tried to talk to staff at the care home , she was told the conversation was ' inappropriate '			0
abuse was carried out at the @entity69 in @entity3			0
pictured is a room at the guest house in an interview with @entity75 , @entity73 said : ' the council put out a press release claiming they had offered wraparound care to all the girls and their families , but the first we heard from them in five years was a letter on april 13 from @entity42 [ director for children , education and families at the council ] , where he says he 's been ' closely involved in providing support ' to me			1
' that 's a complete lie			0
my family have had no support or offers of help at all from @entity98			2
not even a phone call			0
' she said the last contact she had with @entity4 was five years ago when her mother begged them to help stop ( @entity106 ) getting into trouble , and said that they ignored her then and ever since			1
@entity73 told police she was attacked by @entity45 in a guest house in @entity3 in november 2006 while he was said to be high on cocaine			0
officers found the girl in the basement ' extremely distressed , crying and shaking '			1
@entity115 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) were found guilty at the @entity23 @entity45 was cleared of raping @entity116 but convicted of having sex with a child she told police she had been held against her will , drugged , raped and repeatedly smacked in the face			1
the 14 - year - old girl was taken to a police station where photographs were taken of her injuries			0
but she later dropped her complaint after pleas from another girl who was seeing @entity45 at the time			0
a spokesman for the council said : ' we are sorry the abuse was not stopped sooner			0
one of the elements of the @entity137 will be an investigation of the support offered to the girls by agencies including social services			1
' our offer of a meeting with girl [ c ] and her family was very sincere and similar offers to the other girls have been accepted			1
we want to do everything we can to help all the girls rebuild their lives and our door is open to @entity145 and her family			0
' yesterday , fighting broke out in the dock at the @entity23 after two other defendants - @entity157 , 25 , and a man who can not be named for legal reasons - were cleared			0
@entity45 struck out at @entity157 before being bundled out of the dock by officers			0
the admissions of failure from the authorities came as it became apparent that police missed several chances to catch gang members before they were finally arrested			0
some victims relived their ordeals during the four - month trial , describing how they were groomed , beaten , betrayed and sold into prostitution around the country			1
@entity173 , the council 's chief executive , apologised to the girls			2
she said : ' @entity4 would like to pay tribute to the bravery of the witnesses that lin giving the evidence that led to the convictions that have been secured in court ... ' we would like to publicly apologise for not stopping this abuse sooner and to reassure everybody that we have learnt a huge number of lessons in terms of how to tackle this type of abuse and that we are now taking decisive action to stop it happening again in @entity98			2
