@entity1 prime minister @entity0 said monday there would be no @entity4 state if he were reelected , in a last - ditch effort to woo right - wing voters on the eve of a general election			1
polling stations opened today for @entity1 's second snap general election in three years in a ballot experts agree is likely to be a referendum on the @entity0 years			1
with his rightwing @entity13 trailing the centre - left @entity14 in the latest opinion polls , @entity0 said that if his rivals were elected security would be compromised and they would give up total @entity1 control over @entity20			1
he 's pictured here giving a statement to the press during his visit on monday to @entity27 , an @entity1 settlement neighbourhood in annexed east @entity20 support : norris in his @entity30 video @entity0 received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star @entity33 , who said that his re-election is crucial for the safety of @entity1			1
in a short @entity30 video called please vote for prime minister @entity0 , @entity33 said : ' i watched prime minister @entity0 's speech before @entity42 , and i saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul			1
i also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the @entity1 people			2
' i have done three movies in @entity1 – ' @entity52 ' being my favorite – and i formed many friendships while there			0
you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way			0
' that 's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only @entity1 but also the @entity67			2
you see , we the @entity67 people need prime minister @entity0 as much as you do			0
weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on @entity67 , too			0
' so i ask you , please , for the sake of @entity1 and the whole @entity75 , vote for prime minister @entity0 on @entity76			1
' and as far as those in the @entity67 and the rest of the world , in this season of @entity82 , it 's good to remember what the @entity83 say about @entity1 and those who support her : ' pray for the peace of @entity20 : may they prosper who love you ' ( @entity90 122:1 )			1
' ' we will continue to build to fortify @entity20 so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever , ' he said on a tour of @entity27 , a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east @entity20			1
@entity0 , who is seeking a third consecutive term , vowed he would never allow the @entity4 to establish a capital in the city 's eastern sector and pledged to build ' thousands ' of settler homes			1
the @entity4 want east @entity20 as capital of their future state , and continued settlement building has incensed the international community , which sees it as an obstacle to peace			1
throughout his campaign , @entity0 has repeatedly accused @entity111 leaders @entity109 and former peace negotiator @entity112 of being ready to abandon @entity1 's claim to @entity20 as its indivisible capital			1
but @entity0 's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing @entity117 website if it was true that there would be no @entity4 state established if he was reelected			1
' indeed , ' said @entity0 , who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side			0
he later told public radio the two - state solution was now irrelevant , saying the ' reality has changed ' and ' any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical @entity127 '			0
@entity0 has based his campaign solidly on security issues , notably the @entity130 nuclear threat , giving short shrift to the focus on economic issues in centre - left campaigning			2
' if @entity112 and @entity136 set up the next government , @entity135 will be established on these hills here , ' he said in @entity27 , using the nickname of his key challenger , @entity142 leader @entity109			0
' @entity135 ' is a derogatory term used by @entity1 politicians to refer to the @entity145 , which has been ruled by @entity4 @entity147 movement @entity146 since 2007			1
@entity0 received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star @entity33 , who said that his re-election is crucial for the safety of @entity1			1
in a short @entity30 video called please vote for prime minister @entity0 , @entity33 said : ' i watched prime minister @entity0 's speech before @entity42 , and i saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul			1
i also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the @entity1 people			0
' i have done three movies in @entity1 – @entity52 being my favorite – and i formed many friendships while there			0
you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way			0
@entity1 @entity142 leader and co-leader of the @entity111 coalition , @entity109 , speaks with citizens as he campaigns on the eve of @entity1 's general election in the coastal @entity1 city of @entity180 ' that 's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only @entity1 but also the @entity67			1
you see , we the @entity67 people need prime minister @entity0 as much as you do			0
weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on @entity67 , too			0
' @entity109 , meanwhile , has dismissed @entity0 's jibes			2
on sunday he pledged to ' safeguard ' @entity20 ' in actions , not just words , more than any other leader ' , and on monday insisted @entity20 would remain forever @entity1 's ' undivided capital '			1
former prime minister and @entity142 leader @entity201 came out in support of @entity109 , calling him ' experienced and responsible ' and someone who could be relied upon to ensure @entity1 's safety			1
the outgoing @entity1 parliament and the latest opinion poll @entity207 , attend his campaign meeting on monday in @entity209 in the @entity1 coastal city of @entity180 despite @entity0 's vitriol , the @entity111 is tipped to come out on top in the election			1
final opinion polls published late last week put the @entity111 ahead with 25 - 26 seats with @entity0 's @entity13 taking 20 - 22 in the 120 - seat @entity216			2
but experts have warned about their reliability of the polls , pointing to the 2013 election when they completely failed to predict the level of support for centrist newcomer @entity223			0
' in all previous elections we had considerable differences between the predictions of the public opinion polls and ( the results ) , ' said professor @entity231 , a political scientist from @entity20 's @entity232			2
' @entity223 did n't get more than 10 or 11 seats in the public opinion polls and finally got twice as many - 19 seats			0
' @entity1 mp and chairperson of center - right @entity223 party , @entity240 , delivers a speech during the election campaign at the @entity1 city of @entity244 near @entity180 the leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier -- as in 2009 when the centrist @entity246 then headed by @entity112 effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought @entity0 to power for a second term			1
' in 2009 , ( @entity13 ) had a 100 - percent chance of forming a government while the leader of the largest party , @entity112 , had no chance whatsoever - and therefore she was not nominated , ' @entity231 said			0
under @entity1 's complex electoral system , the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes , but to the mp or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61			1
meanwhile , @entity0 has also made overtures to centre - right @entity271 party , seen as the kingmaker , offering the finance portfolio to its leader @entity274 who dismissed this as ' spin '			0
' whoever wants to follow ( @entity0 's ) path of despair and disappointment will vote for him , ' @entity109 said after casting his vote			2
' but whoever wants change , hope , and really a better future for @entity1 , will vote the @entity111 led by me			2
' that call resonated with 51 - year - old @entity288 , who voted at a polling station in @entity290 in central @entity1			2
he said he was a lifelong @entity13 voter but was now casting his ballot for the @entity111			0
' i have had enough , ' said @entity288 , a businessman whose company deals with spare parts for buses			0
' @entity0 tried and tried and tried , but it just has n't worked			0
it 's time to give someone else a chance			0
it ca n't get worse than this			0
' @entity1 election officials said 26.5 percent of eligible voters had voted by midday , a rate similar to previous years			1
elections day is a public holiday in @entity1 - most people do not go to work , beaches and restaurants fill up , and stores advertise election - day sales			2
@entity314 featured a special ' i voted ' button in @entity317 , as it has during elections in other countries , in an effort to get out the vote			0
this election season has amplified the bitter divide between hard - liners and moderates in @entity1 .			2

polling stations opened today for @entity1 's second snap general election
experts agree it 's likely to be a referendum on the @entity0 years
the @entity4 want east @entity20 as capital of their future state
@entity0 vowed he would never let the @entity4 establish this
@entity33 backs @entity0 with short speech released on @entity30
@entity1 election officials said 26.5 *%* of eligible voters had voted by midday
