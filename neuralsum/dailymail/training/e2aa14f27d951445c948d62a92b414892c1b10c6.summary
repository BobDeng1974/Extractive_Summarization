click here to read which players could challenge @entity3 's record of becoming the youngest to reach 100 caps for @entity5 @entity3 will tell the younger members of the @entity5 squad they must not be intimidated by the hostile atmosphere at @entity9 on tuesday			1
@entity3 marked his entry into the 100 club with a crucial penalty on saturday as @entity5 came from behind to record a 3 - 1 win over @entity14			1
@entity15 now turns to tuesday 's international against @entity16 in @entity17			1
although a friendly by name , there will be no sense of bonhomie between the two sides or the rival fans inside the famous 60,000 - seater stadium			2
@entity3 has urged youngsters to play their ' normal game ' when @entity5 face @entity16 @entity3 scores @entity5 's opening goal in their 3 - 1 victory over @entity14 at @entity29 on saturday @entity3 knows all about the white - hot atmosphere of @entity9			1
he played there twice with @entity33 and he has also watched from the stands after being given tickets by his old team - mates @entity37 and @entity38			0
given the intense rivalry between the two nations , @entity3 expects the decibel levels to be even higher on tuesday night and he therefore feels his inexperienced team - mates may need some calm words of reassurance before kick - off			1
' you do n't realise until you actually play there what the atmosphere is like , ' the @entity5 captain said			1
' the atmosphere was great when i was in the crowd , unbelievable , but you do n't realise until you 're on that pitch what it 's like so maybe a few of them , you might need to speak to them and say : ' listen , this is going to be hostile			2
make sure you blank it out , relax , and play your normal game			0
do n't get involved in it			0
'' @entity3 is presented with a ' golden cap ' by @entity64 ( @entity65 ) after reaching 100 appearances for @entity5 @entity5 are virtually assured of reaching the @entity68 finals after going six points clear in their group the atmosphere will be the polar opposite to the one inside @entity29 on saturday			1
once @entity3 had gained his commemorative golden cap from sir @entity64 and his two children had left the field , the 82,305 fans inside @entity29 quickly fell silent			2
it was easy to see why			0
@entity5 's first - half performance was terrible - among the worst in a long while			2
the only time they looked like scoring was when @entity84 had to stick his right leg out to deflect @entity87 's woeful back - pass wide			0
@entity3 has experienced the hostile atmosphere at @entity9 as a @entity33 player @entity3 's landmark century managed to overshadow @entity91 's brace that secured victory the night before , @entity16 maintained the pressure on their group rivals @entity96 and @entity97 with a hard - fought 1 - 0 win over the @entity99			1
and @entity3 thinks the @entity100 will pose a tough test for @entity5 next week			1
' @entity16 are doing well at the minute , ' he said			2
' they seem to have found a bit of form under @entity106 , so we know it 'll be a tough game			0
' @entity5 versus @entity16 is the oldest fixture in international football and until 25 years ago there was an annual meeting between the two nations			1
last august 's action - packed friendly at @entity29 , which @entity5 won 3 - 2 , led to calls for the return of the fixture on a yearly basis and @entity3 seems to be in favour of that too			1
' that would be nice , ' he said			0
' it 's obviously not down to me , but it would be good			0
' @entity126 celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity16 against @entity128 in their @entity68 qualifier @entity130 scores during @entity5 's 3 - 2 victory over @entity16 in last year 's international friendly @entity14 quickly crumbled on saturday after @entity3 won and converted his 59th minute penalty			1
@entity91 scored his 12th and 13th @entity5 goals to stretch @entity5 's lead at the top of @entity138 to six points			2
@entity141 's only disappointment was that his team had conceded their first qualification goal thanks to @entity145 's 57th minute own goal			0
' when we went a goal down it was important we came straight back and we did that , ' the @entity5 manager said			2
' in the end it was a very good victory			0
we have beaten @entity153 away and @entity14 at home and we are in a good position			0
@entity145 's own goal to give @entity14 the lead was @entity141 's only complaint @entity159 has been released by @entity5 and will be replaced by either @entity160 or @entity161 ' our goal before this game was to go into the @entity164 with 12 points , unbeaten			1
' the only disappointment is that we now can no longer boast about having a clean sheet but i suppose we still can boast that no opponent has scored against us because we put the ball in our own goal for them			0
' @entity141 confirmed after the match that @entity159 had been released from the squad			0
with the @entity176 goalkeeper rested , either former @entity177 man @entity160 or @entity178 's @entity161 will be given a chance to impress in goal against @entity16 .			0
