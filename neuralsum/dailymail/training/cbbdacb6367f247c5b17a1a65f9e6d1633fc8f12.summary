by @entity1 reporter published : 15:14 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 07:36 est , 26 august 2013 homes in @entity3 have been rocked by two earthquakes beneath the @entity5			2
the @entity6 , which collected data on the quakes , said the strongest had a magnitude of 3.3 on the @entity10 at a depth of three miles			1
it was recorded just before 10am			2
an earlier quake at around 5.30am measured 2.4			1
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) said the quakes were probably caused by stresses built up from the weight of glaciers covering land during the @entity19			1
homes in @entity3 have been rocked by two earthquakes beneath the @entity5 @entity13 director @entity21 said it was unusual that the earthquakes - measuring 2.4 and then a stronger 3.3 on the @entity10 - happened in the @entity5			1
@entity24 from the @entity6 said it could have been ‘ quite alarming ’ and added : ‘ not many people experience earthquakes in the @entity28			2
there are only two or three of them a year of that size			1
’ last year it was suggested that fracking tests in the region had caused tremors in @entity3			1
' it is impossible to tell if stronger earthquakes will occur in the coming days and weeks , but aftershocks can be expected even if most , if not all , will be too weak to be felt , ' mr @entity21 said			0
social media users took to @entity40 saying they felt the ground move beneath them - particularly in the north west of @entity44			1
@entity40 user @entity45 , said : ‘ the bed was shaking			0
i thought it was a big lorry going past			0
’ the strongest quake , at a depth of 5km , was recorded by the @entity6 shortly before 10am			2
the earlier and smaller quake was recorded at around 5.30am			0
its epicentre was about 25km west of @entity54 in @entity55 at a depth of 3km			1
the larger earthquake was also recorded by @entity13 seismometers as far away as @entity59 and @entity60 in @entity61			0
last year it was suggested that fracking tests in the region had caused tremors in @entity3 mr @entity21 , from the @entity66 in the @entity67 , said their cause was probably no different from other earthquakes in @entity28 and @entity61			1
' although @entity28 and @entity61 are far from any plate boundaries , much of the region is still experiencing quakes due to the removal of the weight of ice sheets that once covered the land , ' he said			2
' occasionally this post-glacial isostatic rebound - the phenomenon of the land surface gradually returning to its pre-glacial contours - results in earthquakes of this magnitude , particularly in the northern half of the islands			0
' a slightly larger earthquake was recorded in the @entity5 back in may , which was felt in parts of @entity61 and @entity88			0
the 3.8 magnitude tremor occurred 15km away from @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92			2
people as far away as @entity94 , @entity60 , @entity95 and @entity96 claimed they felt it at the time			0
according to the @entity13 , the largest known @entity28 earthquake struck near the @entity100 in the @entity101 off the east coast of @entity44 in 1931 , with a magnitude of 6.1			0
the largest to impact @entity61 occurred on the @entity105 peninsula , @entity88 , in july 1984			0
the 5.4 magnitude earthquake was the largest ever recorded earthquake on mainland @entity28 and was felt throughout @entity61 's east coast , @entity92 and @entity44			0
aftershocks from the quake measured up to 4.3 on the @entity10 and some structural damage resulted along the east coast of @entity61 .			1

one tremor measured 3.3 on the @entity10 at a depth of three miles
its epicentre was about 25km west of @entity54 in @entity55
last year it was suggested fracking tests in region had caused tremors
