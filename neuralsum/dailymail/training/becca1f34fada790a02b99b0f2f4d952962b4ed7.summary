by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 21 june 2013 costly : @entity3 fire service managers ' navy blue shirts have been replaced by white ones , pictured , to distinguish them from firefighters - at a cost of nearly £ 13,000 to the taxpayer the fire brigade has splashed out £ 13,000 on white shirts for bosses - so they look different to blue - shirted firefighters			1
some 475 managers at @entity13 have had their traditional navy blue shirts replaced by white ones to help distinguish themselves from the firefighters			1
bosses say the change will help the public recognise a senior officer but the move has been labelled a ‘ vanity project ’ by firefighters , while union leaders say it is an ‘ unnecessary extravagance ’			1
crew managers , watch managers and borough commanders posted at stations and bosses at the brigade ’s @entity31 will have to wear the new shirts to make them stand out from their colleagues			1
their five blue collared shirts and five blue t - shirts , which are worn underneath , have been taken away and replaced with five white collared shirts and five white t - shirts at a cost of £ 12,668 to the taxpayer			1
bosses claim the cost of the total new white kit is from an existing budget and actually comes in £ 1,300 cheaper than the blue equivalent			2
assistant chief fire officer @entity46 said : ' fire stations belong to the community and are proving their value to @entity3 more than ever by being a hub for many groups and activities			1
' since stations became much more open and home to larger numbers of local groups , we realised people need to be able to identify who is in charge - and we want it to be just as easy to spot who is in charge when crews are out working in the community , which is now how they spend the majority of their shifts			0
so this helps that too			0
' the shirts have been brought in through a staged approach			0
the unused blue shirts that are returned to stores will be reused and issued to firefighters when they next need them			2
distinguishing rank : the new management shirts are similar to this one already worn by @entity77 officer @entity76 , pictured left , compared to the traditional blue shirts , right ' the new white ones are more cost effective long term			2
other @entity84 fire and rescue services have already adopted this uniform for managers			2
' but the move has been criticised by firefighters who believe the money could be better spent elsewhere			2
one officer , who did n't want to be named , said : ' it ’s just a vanity project and a waste of money			1
crew managers and watch managers still go out jobs and a white shirt is just going to be impractical			0
they get stuck in as much as anyone else			0
they ’ll just end up in the bin			0
' another added : ' it ’s a ridiculous waste of taxpayers ’ money that appears to come about on a whim			0
senior firefighters can already be recognised because they wear white helmets			0
it does n’t make sense			0
' @entity111 , secretary of the @entity112 , said : ' at a time when firefighters positions are being lost , this looks like an unnecessary extravagance			1
' last year fire service bosses warned that further cuts to funding could lead to the closure of fire stations and compulsory redundancies			1
the authority has lost 300 uniformed posts and 100 support roles since implementing budget cuts in 2011			0
divided : bosses at @entity3 's @entity128 headquarters in @entity31 , pictured , will have to wear the white shirts as well as borough commanders , crew and watch managers			1

new shirts will help ' distinguish ' bosses from their blue - shirted firefighters
@entity3 fire service managers already wear different colour hats
move has been branded a ' vanity project ' and ' unnecessary extravagance '
