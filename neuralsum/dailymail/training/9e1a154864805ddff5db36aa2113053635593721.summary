ministers are set to offer £ 2million more in childcare grants to make @entity3 the female employment capital of @entity4			1
almost half a million women are expected to enter the labour market by the start of 2016 – largely thanks to government tax breaks			2
this would see the @entity3 leapfrog @entity10 as the major economy with the highest female employment rate on the continent			1
chancellor @entity16 , on a two - day tour meeting ' women working in the @entity3 economy ' , is helped to choose a christmas tree for @entity19 by @entity21 owner of @entity22 mr @entity16 wants @entity3 to have the highest proportion of women in work in @entity4 @entity16 welcomed the surge but said there was ‘ more we can do to support women into work ’			1
he revealed he was considering boosting a scheme to help those who want to set themselves up as childminders			0
but the plan will prove unpopular with those who believe the @entity37 is denigrating stay - at - home mothers by encouraging women to put children into childcare and go out to work			1
at present , 67 per cent of working - age women in @entity3 are in work – a record high of 14.4million ; behind @entity10 on 69.2 per cent			1
analysis by the @entity46 said that 450,000 extra women in jobs would enable us to close the gap			2
this is expected to happen by the start of 2016			0
the expected surge will also put @entity3 within touching distance of @entity55 , whose rate of 69.3 per cent is currently the highest in the @entity59 group of the richest nations			1
at present , 67 per cent of working - age women in @entity3 are in work – a record high of 14.4million ; behind @entity10 on 69.2 per cent			1
file picture mr @entity16 said : ‘ our long - term economic plan is all about creating jobs and the economic security that comes with that			2
‘ today ’s research shows women are playing an ever larger role in the economy , but it also makes clear that there ’s more we can do to support women into work			2
’ since 2010 the number of women in work has increased by more than 771,000			1
in the past year alone , the total has risen by 368,000 to 14.4million			0
but the analysis said : ‘ we still have more to do to increase female employment			1
’ the chancellor said the government is considering pouring more funds into a scheme to help people who want to set up childcare businesses			0
the @entity46 is looking at extending the scheme for another year , costing £ 2million , to support the creation of up to 50,000 further childcare places			0
education secretary @entity92 , who is also minister for women , said : ‘ women are making huge strides in the economy and it ’s vital their contributions are recognised			0
‘ no woman should have to choose between their career and their family			0
that ’s why we ’ve extended the right to request flexible working and from next year will allow parents to share leave following the birth of their child			0
‘ all three and four - year - olds now receive 15 hours of free childcare a week , extended to around 40 per cent of two - year - olds from disadvantaged backgrounds , and we ’re also introducing tax - free childcare worth £ 2,000 per child			0
’ meanwhile , a study by the @entity117 casts doubt on claims that childcare schemes encouraged mothers to work			2
a scheme offering extra free nursery places for three - year - olds , launched in 1998 , costs taxpayers £ 66,000 for every woman who has taken a job , they found .			0

@entity3 could *overtake* @entity10 to take highest female employment rate
since 2010 the number of women in work has increased by over 771,000
but some believe *measures* denigrate stay - at - home mothers
