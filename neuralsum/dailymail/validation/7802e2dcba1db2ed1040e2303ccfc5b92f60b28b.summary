staring at a scrawled picture of a bright orange pumpkin surrounded by purple and pink witches , @entity0 is nearly moved to tears			0
‘ when he ’s drawing i see my son going in and out of his crayon box like 50 times and now i see why , ’ he says , his voice quiet with pride and his mouth turned up at the corners			0
one of 300 million people worldwide , @entity0 has colour blindness , meaning he has never been able to truly appreciate his son ’s sketches			1
@entity26 is pictured , amazed by the sight of wool in rainbow colours the glasses can assist with colour blindness , a condition that affects 300 million people worldwide			1
@entity0 is pictured avidly staring at a colourful display he is trialling new glasses which correct the condition , allowing him to experience normal vision for the first time in his life			1
@entity38 , a @entity39 - based paints company , have released a video showing colour blind people using the glasses for the first time			1
in the film , @entity0 is later seen staring at a warm sunset			2
he laughs with joy , exclaiming ‘ is this what you guys see every day ? ’ @entity23 , who manufacture the glasses featured in the film , claim the spectacles allow wearers to ‘ gain faster and more accurate discrimination of colours such as in traffic signals and signs ’			1
they can also ‘ improve confidence with colour naming ’ , and increase the perception of detail and depth in coloured objects			2
but best of all , @entity23 says the glasses give people who view the world in varying shades of grey the ‘ profound experience of a bright and vivid world of colour ’			1
@entity0 is pictured looking at his son 's drawings and being able to see the colours for the first time			1
he said : ‘ when he ’s drawing i see my son going in and out of his crayon box like 50 times and now i see why ’ the @entity23 glasses allow people with the condition to distinguish between colours			1
for colour blind people , red and black may look the same			2
@entity87 is shown viewing flowers with the glasses @entity23 says the glasses give people who view the world in varying shades of grey the ‘ profound experience of a bright and vivid world of colour ’			1
@entity98 is pictured staring at a sunset @entity100 , a perceptual psychologist featured in the video , said : ‘ colour blindness is a situation where , because your eyes are different from someone else ’s eyes you do n’t see the world in the same way			1
‘ commonly , red and green do n’t look different , they look the same			0
‘ if there ’s a colour filter , like glasses , that can separate colours they suddenly can see red and green again			2
@entity118 , co-founder of @entity23 , added : ‘ there ’s nothing wrong with the wiring			2
‘ the problem exists in the eye , with the photopigments			2
so @entity38 is working with us at @entity23 to bring colour to everyone			2
‘ we developed these glasses to enable colour blind people to see colour for the first time in their lives ’ colour blindness , also known as colour vision deficiency , is where a person finds it difficult to distinguish between different colours			1
for example , completely different colours like red and black might appear the same			2
in most cases , colour blindness is inherited , but it can also develop as the result of a pre-existing health condition , or as a side effect of certain medicines			1
it occurs due to an abnormality of the retina , the layer of cells at the back of the eye that are sensitive to light			1
the cone cells in the retina are sensitive to different wavelengths of light			1
for people with normal vision , the brain compares the signals from all three cones , enabling a person to see the colour of an object			1
but for people who are colour blind , one or more cones will be missing or wo n't function normally , which means they will be unable to see the full spectrum of colours			1

but for people who are colour blind , one or more cones will be missing or wo n't function normally , which means they will be unable to see the full spectrum of colours			1
for example , one of the cones in the eye will absorb too much red light , creating a phenomenon called ‘ spectral overlap ’			2
@entity23 says spectral overlap is analogous to how to radio stations played at the same time might bleed together			2
the two streams of information conflict , and the more the signals overlap , the greater the extent of the colour blindness			1
the glasses , which cost upwards from $ 349.95 ( £ 235 ) , work by correcting the overlap , separating the signals and providing better perception of colour			2
however , @entity23 adds that the glasses are not a cure for color blindness – it is a product that can assist with it			1

@entity236 : i wanted to go into the military and trying to be a navy sail and that ’s where i found out i was colour blind			2
it changed the direction i was going it , i stayed in the military but i was n’t able to pursue being a navy seal			0
i ’ve always wanted to see the colours of the flag , but to actually be able to see and distinguish the red clearly			2
before , red looked like a brown to me			0
it ’s hard to even put into words how to describe seeing it for the first time			0
that alone is priceless to me			0
the flag has a lot of importance for me			0
@entity87 : i found out when i was in elementary school , in third grade			0
the teacher had crayons out in school and she asked me to identify the crayons and i could n’t and that was the first experience of realising i was colour blind			0
i looked at it as a curse			0
for me , it was a setback			0
you have goals , you have things you want to achieve and being colour blind holds you back			0
i wanted to join the marine forces , but because of my colour vision deficiency that ’s not the door			1
i ca n’t work in special ops , i ca n’t work in combat			0
with the glasses it makes it a lot better			0
i ’ve had the opportunity to see colour in a way i never have in my entire life , so for me that ’s exciting			0
@entity98 : i think my colour blindness was discovered in kindergarten			1
i was drawing my flowers brown and my oceans black and skies were purple			0
i think its 0.5 per cent that a girl is actually colour blind			0
when i used the glasses i thought ‘ is this what it really looks like to you guys ? ’			0
for a second i felt sad , like i ’d been missing out on how vibrant it all is			0
but then i thought how cool it is that i get the opportunity to see the world in a different way , and its special to me			0
@entity26 : when i smell roses i think of my mother			0
when i was a little boy we had a rosebush in the back yard and it was yellow with red tips			0
and i still see it today and i think ‘ it ’s so beautiful ’			0
but i think ‘ what was i not seeing in that rose ’			0
if i were to see that rose and there were other colours there i would think that was kind of poetic			0
on the first day of school she would take me to the back yard and she would cut me a rose to give to my teacher			0
what if saw that rose and i saw all these colours that i never saw before ? i think it would be in a way like my mother was speaking again to me .			0

colour blindness , or colour vision deficiency , affects around 300 million people worldwide
it occurs due to an abnormality in the cone cells in the eye 's retina , which detect different wavelengths of light
one or more of the cones will be missing or wo n't function normally , meaning the person can not see all colours
@entity39 - based *technology* company @entity23 have developed new glasses which can boost people 's colour vision
touching film shows people seeing their *children* 's drawings , sunsets and flowers in colour for the first time
