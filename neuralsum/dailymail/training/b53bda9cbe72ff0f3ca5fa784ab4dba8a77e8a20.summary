@entity0 and lava from a volcanic eruption in the remote @entity3 have formed a new island measuring one square mile in size			1
photographs taken of the island of @entity9 , since an eruption off its coast in november 20 , 2013 , reveal the landmass is continuing to increase in size in an extremely rare volcanic phenomenon			1
the eruption off the coast of @entity9 - which is located within the @entity15 - initially created an islet but the volcanic discharge has now merged with it to form a single landmass			2
initially , scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time			2
the coastguard said the island is now 52 times bigger than the @entity43 and is expected to continue growing , @entity40 reported			0
early images also revealed remarkable discoloration of the water , caused by volcanic minerals and white puffs of steam and gases			0
although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions , they are rarely as powerful as the latest one			0
this picture , taken on december 25 , 2013 , shows the new islet in its early formative stages after erupting for a month , it had formed an islet that just touched neighbouring @entity9 the underwater eruption began ( pictured left and right ) on november 20 , 2013 , and has continued ever since in fact , the forming of the new island is the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years			1
video footage showed smoke billowing from part of the ocean around the @entity72 island chain and the @entity74 coastguard later confirmed it was coming from the new islet			0
this chain , located 620miles south of the @entity74 capital @entity79 , is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands			2
volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as @entity84			0
recent images taken by the @entity74 coastguard show the islet has now joined the existing @entity9 the island chain in which it is located is 620miles south of the @entity74 capital @entity79 and made up of over 30 islands			1

the volcanic eruption in the @entity3 began on november 20 , 2013
it occurred off the coast of @entity9 island , 620miles south of @entity79
@entity0 and lava from the eruption have now connected with the island
together they *'ve* formed a landmass measuring one square mile in size
