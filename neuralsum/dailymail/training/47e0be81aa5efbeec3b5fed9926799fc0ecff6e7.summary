the year 7 pupil had been treated to the £ 15 haircut by his step - grandfather over the @entity22 holidays and opted for that particular design because of his love of the @entity6 brand			1
@entity12 , 11 , from @entity26 , @entity16 , was taken out of school for a week by his angry mother who said it was ' ridiculous ' he was put into isolation for his £ 15 @entity6 haircut however , when he went back to school after the festive break , he was immediately banished to isolation and forced to work on his own for not complying with school uniform rules			1
his mother , @entity36 , immediately collected her son and kept him off school for a week until she met with staff at the school to resolve the situation			2
the 28 - year - old hairdresser , of @entity26 , @entity16 , said : ' it 's ridiculous			1
it 's clear there 's a school uniform policy but a haircut is n't a uniform			1
' by 8.45am last monday they had rang and told me he was going to be put in isolation			2
i said " no you 're not " and went and picked him up			0
' the minute we got home he burst into tears			0
he was chuffed with his hair over @entity22 and then all this happened when he went back and it knocked him down			0
' he was hurt to think he 'd been put into isolation and for something so trivial			2
it is not right that he had to sit in a room by himself because of a haircut			0
i kept him off because i 'm not having my son treated as a prisoner			0
' mother @entity67 , left , said she ' did n't want her son to be treated like a prisoner ' after 11 - year - old @entity12 , right , was put into isolation for his @entity6 shaved hairstyle @entity12 's stepdad , @entity72 , said the decision to put the youngster in isolation over a haircut was ' pathetic '			1

a haircut does n't affect his learning			0
' he had stars shaved into the back of his head when he was around nine or 10 and no one at his primary school said anything then so we did n't think it would be a problem this time around			0
' mr @entity72 also said the ordeal would n't stop his stepson having another unique hairstyle in future			0
he said : ' he 'll probably have another one again ... it will just be in the six week summer holiday next time			0
' @entity15 in west @entity16 said the ' extreme ' haircut was completely against the school 's uniform policy @entity12 , 11 , right , had all of last week off school after his mother @entity36 , right , said he could stay off until he was allowed back into normal classrooms instead of being banished to isolation however , @entity105 , vice-principle at @entity15 in west @entity16 , said the school uniform policy was clear to both pupils and parents			1

the decision to remove @entity12 from school was not ours			2
' the vice-principle also upheld that hairstyles were ' very much a part of the school uniform policy '			1
he said : ' hairstyles are absolutely part of school uniform and we do n't accept extreme haircuts			2
' @entity15 is the top performing state school in @entity16 and we believe our school uniform policy is one of the factors that makes us such a good school and one of choice for our parents			1
