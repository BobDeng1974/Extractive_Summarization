filmmaker @entity0 has sparked controversy after calling for photographs of the slain children of @entity4 to be made public			1
the @entity6 director took to his blog on wednesday to argue that gory photographs of the crime scene and the bodies of @entity12 's 26 shooting victims should be released to force @entity13 to act on gun control			1
under an item entitled ' @entity13 , you must not look away ( how to finish off the @entity17 ) ' outspoken @entity0 says that similar horrific images forced changes in public opinion on issues like civil rights and @entity23			1
controversy : @entity0 has called for pictures of the scenes at @entity4 - including images of the bodies of the child victims - to be released			1
the filmmaker says they would make @entity13 act on gun control opposition : many criticized @entity0 's stance today saying it would be an ' offense ' to victims and their families to do such a thing he said a similar route should be taken on gun control			1
' i believe someone in @entity45 , @entity46 – a grieving parent , an upset law enforcement officer , a citizen who has seen enough of this carnage in our country – somebody , someday soon , is going to leak the crime scene photos of the @entity4 , ' he writes			1
' and when the @entity13 people see what bullets from an assault rifle fired at close range do to a little child 's body , that 's the day the jig will be up for the @entity17			1
' ' it will be the day the debate on gun control will come to an end			1
there will be nothing left to argue over			2
it will just be over			2
and every sane @entity13 will demand action			1
' denial : the documentary maker says @entity13 is in denial about the need to act and such images would give them the jolt they need to do something and ' end the @entity17 ' he adds that he expects there will be an outcry from many that publishing the images is ' sick ' and a ' disgrace '			1
but he goes on : ' this will be a false outrage			0
because the real truth is this : we do not want to be confronted with what the actual results of a violent society looks like			0
' ' because if we were to seriously look at the 20 slaughtered children – i mean really look at them , with their bodies blown apart , many of them so unrecognizable the only way their parents could identify them was by the clothes they were wearing – what would be our excuse not to act ? now			2
this very instant ! ' however among those who were opposed to such a stance were families of the victims who spoke to @entity110 yesterday			2
@entity111 , whose 6 - year - old daughter @entity112 , was killed in the attack said : ' i would be very strongly against that			0
' trying to recover : children from @entity117 are pictured here returning to school			0
a victim support worker said @entity0 's suggestion would ruin the memories of the young victims another mother told the broadcaster : ' you can imagine what my reaction to that is '			1
co-president of the @entity131 , @entity132 , added : ' it ’s going to be a long healing process and to dredge up pictures of the crime scene would not be a good thing			1
' we want to remember the little angels as they were , with their happy expressions and faces and you want to think of the teachers trying to hold them safe and not to see the pictures of their bodies			0
' for the families and the community , we just want to get back to a normal life and that would be a horrendous offense to the families			1
there ’s no need for any of that			0
' however , @entity0 says one mother may understand where he is coming from			0
@entity157 , mother of 6 - year - old victim @entity158 , took @entity46 governor @entity159 by the hand to see her young son 's open - casket			2
remembrance : many victims families want to remember them as they lived rather than as they died she later said his death had to be seen			2
' i owed it to him as his mother — the good , the bad , the ugly , ' @entity157 told the @entity174			0
' it is not up to me to say i am only going to look at you and deal with you when you are alive , that i am going to block out the reality of what you look like when you are dead			0
' ' and as a little boy , you have to go in the ground			0
if i am going to shut my eyes to that i am not his mother			0
i had to bear it			0
i had to do it			0
' @entity0 signs off with a warning to the @entity17 that if @entity4 photos are n't released , another victim 's family could release gun crime photos in the future and that would spell their end			1
' while you 're looking at the heinous photographs , try saying those words out loud : ' i support the @entity197 ! ' something , i 'm guessing , wo n't feel right , ' he writes ' yes , someday a @entity4 mother – or a @entity200 mother , or an @entity202 mother , or a mother from massacres yet to come – will say , like the mother of @entity206 , " i just want the world to see			2
" and then nothing about guns in this country will ever be the same again			0
