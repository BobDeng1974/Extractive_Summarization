sitting in the waiting room of the antenatal clinic i was aghast at the sight of the women around me			1
to my left , a lady awaiting a 20 - week scan munched her way through an enormous bag of crisps			0
another woman had spread a napkin over her expansive thighs and was devouring an oversized ' breakfast muffin '			0
these , as any self - respecting woman knows , are just calorie - laden cakes masquerading as a healthy meal			1
this is a ruse that only ever seems to fool the overweight			0
all around me i spotted arms , chins , thighs and bottoms			0
dimpled , corpulent flesh was everywhere			0
if it were n't for the pregnancy bumps , this easily could be mistaken for a slimming club meeting			1
only at a slimming club , there is a sense of shame , or responsibility and desire to change			0
' four weeks , ' i replied proudly			0
her eyes dropped immediately to my compact bump , and i could see her mental processes working overtime			0
her initial incredulity rapidly morphed into anger at me and pity for my unborn child			0
' @entity50 , ' i could tell she was thinking			0
putting her own vanity before the health of her baby			1
' in a word , she was seized by jealousy - the green - eyed monster that seems to turn the most sensible and intelligent of women into bile - spitting harpies when faced with something they wish they had			1
i suspect that was the real reason behind 75 - year - old feminist @entity69 's attack on the @entity70 this week			0
her argument was that @entity70 , who happens to be suffering again from chronic morning sickness , was ' too thin ' , and that she ' should n't have been made to go through all this again so soon [ after the birth of @entity75 ] '			2
her outburst infuriated me , as i too came in for constant criticism just because i chose not to put on mountains of blubber during my own pregnancy , which culminated a year ago in the birth of my bouncy , happy , healthy son , @entity83			1
despite the bleatings of all those who attacked me for refusing to eat for two , we were both declared to be in perfect health just hours after the birth			2
why wo n't people wake up and acknowledge that the real risk to unborn babies comes when their mothers are obese ? staying healthy : @entity39 had a small bump at six months , left , causing her friends and even strangers to criticise her for not eating enough			1
@entity70 also had a neat bump when she was pregnant with @entity75 at six months , right dr @entity97 , chairman of the @entity98 , recently warned : ' obesity in pregnant women can lead to all sorts of problems , including the death of the mother , or of the baby through stillbirth , or the baby having foetal abnormalities , or the woman suffering pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes , or requiring a caesarean because either she or the baby is too big			1
' i firmly believe that if more mothers adopted my - and @entity70 's - approach to pregnancy , scant @entity116 resources would not be wasted treating the problems associated with maternal obesity			1
every woman has a duty to exercise and eat healthily before and during pregnancy - for her own good and the good of her unborn child			1
the morning of that antenatal appointment for example , i 'd already done an hour 's workout in the gym and eaten a bowl of organic porridge for breakfast			0
this was all part of my campaign to ensure i only gained minimal weight during pregnancy			2
and , i 'm pleased to say , it worked			0
four weeks before having my baby boy by caesarean section - essential due to complications with the placenta - i was still wearing my pre-pregnancy size 10 tops			2
i never bought any maternity wear at all - except for some pregnancy jeans with stretchy waistbands			0
my pregnancy coincided with @entity70 's first and i would examine photos of her forensically			0
i felt absolutely inspired by her mini-bump and otherwise slim frame			0
of course , the mummy - tummy mafia were n't so keen , branding her selfish for remaining trim and claiming this put pressure on ordinary mums not to pile on the pounds			1
for me , @entity70 - known for her love of sport - was welcome proof that not every mother - to - be has to turn into an overweight , out - of - shape slob			2
and like @entity70 , i was seven months pregnant before my bump even started to show in my clothes			2
starting to bloom : a more noticeable bump at seven months , right , and seven - and - a - half - months , left , but she was still slim compared to the other expectant women she met who had seen pregnancy as an excuse to pile on the pounds according to my midwife , it was the legacy of my tight abdominal muscles , developed through years of regular exercise			1
she estimated i 'd gained just a stone - and - a - half when i was full term			0
i was well within the healthy weight - gain boundaries			1
experts recommend you should put on no more than 21 to 28lb while expecting , a combination of baby , placenta , amniotic fluid , extra blood and around half a stone of fat laid down naturally in preparation for breastfeeding			1
but , just like poor @entity70 , i had to defend myself throughout , to everyone from friends to other pregnant women and even strangers			1
at five months , when i still had no visible baby bump , friends started to voice their concern , telling me sanctimoniously that i was failing my unborn baby			1
this went on right up until the moment i gave birth last september			0
' are you eating properly ? ' one old friend demanded when i met her for dinner at seven months			2
' is n't it time you let go of your need to be slim for once ? ' snarled another			2
one close girlfriend was particularly vociferous , exclaiming : ' you 've not put on nearly enough weight , you need to concentrate on nourishing your baby			1
' that hurt , as it insinuated that i was n't putting my son 's health first when that could n't have been further from the truth			1
in the gym there were looks of disdain on the faces of other members at the sight of a pregnant woman lifting weights			2
and out powerwalking - i stopped running outdoors at 17 weeks - the disapproving tuts of passers - by were audible			0
when i wrote in this newspaper last year about exercising till i was eight months pregnant , i was vilified , with critics even suggesting my child would be born underweight or with shaken baby syndrome			1
yet when did you ever hear anyone berate a pregnant woman for putting her feet up , gorging herself on cream cakes and chips and whacking on a pile of unnecessary weight ? all i did was continue to exercise daily and eat a diet rich in chicken , turkey and fish , lots of fresh vegetables and homemade soups			1
full - term : @entity39 had gained just a stone - and - a - half - and she was back in her size 10 jeans just over a fortnight after giving birth proud : despite the mummy mafia 's reservations , @entity83 was born weighing a very healthy 7lb 6oz all of this was done with the blessing of my obstetrician , who said that she wished more women would take the approach i had			1
my priority was to be the healthiest i could be for the good of my baby			2
but i 'm not ashamed to admit that i was also terrified of losing my figure out of vanity			0
what 's wrong with that ? why would i suddenly want to be fat just because i was pregnant ? my husband 's only concern was that i and our baby were healthy			1
but i 've always taken pride in my appearance and would have seen it as disrespectful to him to let myself go			0
all the research backs up my sensible approach , even though the mummy mafia wo n't agree			2
countless studies have proved that a sensible diet and being active throughout pregnancy are good for the woman and her unborn child			0
the @entity276 ' policy adviser , @entity275 , is unequivocal regarding nutrition and the dangerous ' eating for two ' myth			1
' in the womb , babies take what they need in terms of nutrition , leaving the mother with the remainder			2
therefore eating more than the baby requires results in excessive weight gain and that will be the mother 's problem in the end			1
' weighing in : @entity69 has said the @entity70 , pictured left shortly before it was announced she 's pregnant again , is too thin in fact , no extra calories are needed until the final three months of a pregnancy , and even then only a further 200 a day are recommended , the equivalent of one extra slice of toast or a small bowl of cereal			2
my argument with the ' thin haters ' was well and truly won when my beautiful son @entity83 was born weighing a very healthy 7lb 6oz			1
and just 16 days later , i was back in my size 10 pre-pregnancy jeans and gleefully stuffing those maternity skinnies into a cupboard			0
unfortunately , the jealousy did n't end there - as it did n't with @entity70 , whose body recovered very quickly after the birth of @entity75 too			0
one friend told me , with a distinct sniff , that i would doubtless gain weight over the coming months as i sat around feeding and cuddling my baby			1
would i find it more comforting to see @entity70 porking out and straining at the seams of her maternity wear during her second pregnancy ? absolutely not			0
i shall be watching , and admiring , her all the way .			0

@entity39 continued to exercise when pregnant and ate healthily
as a result , she did not put on excess weight
but friends and strangers were concerned she was n't eating enough
they *accused* her of not nourishing her baby
but ' eating for two ' is a myth
her son was born a healthy 7lb 6oz
she is proud she did n't ' let herself go ' when pregnant
thinks other women view having a baby as an excuse to get fat
obesity can cause health problems for both mother and baby
