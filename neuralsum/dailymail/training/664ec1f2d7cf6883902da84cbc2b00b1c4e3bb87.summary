building new roads can be an arduous and back - breaking task but thanks to a @entity5 inventor , paving is now as simple as rolling out a carpet			2
the amazing machine , named @entity8 , can create an instant road wherever it travels , laying out bricks in formation to create perfect paving			0
while the process may look magical , the secret behind the invention lies in a smartly - designed gravity - based system			1
from there gravity causes them to slide together , in a sheet of paving , onto the ground			0
brick roads have long been sought - after due to their attractiveness and durability but have become less common because of the labour - intensive work that goes into laying them , compared to other road surfaces such as concrete or asphalt			0
however , with a @entity31 workers are able to lay out 400 square metres of new road every day , using paving stones or bricks , compared to a single conventional paver on their hands and knees who would only be able to manage between 75 and 100 square metres			1
invention : the machine is the brainchild of @entity59 after he decided that kneeling to lay the bricks was too labour - intensive perfect paving : the device is fed loose bricks and lays them out onto the road as it slowly moves along the machine is the brainchild of @entity59 , director of @entity5 industrial company @entity65 , who came up with his ground - breaking invention after deciding that squatting or kneeling down to place the bricks into the ground by hand was too much like hard work			1
the device , which is as wide as a road and comes in four , five and six - metre widths , is fed loose bricks and lays them out onto the road as it slowly moves along			2
the tread - tracked machine is electrically - powered , and has few moving parts , so noise and maintenance are kept to a minimum			0
once the bricks are in place , all a contractor has to do is go over the new road surface with a tamper , and the new highway is complete			0
@entity86 work : the @entity31 can lay out 400 square metres of paving a day , compared to the 75 to 100 square metres which could be done by hand			1

@entity31 can lay an *incredible* 400 metres of bricks a day
device works using gravity - based system
