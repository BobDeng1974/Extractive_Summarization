@entity1 prison officials have changed their execution protocols after they botched the procedure on an inmate how ' writhed and moaned for 43 minutes ' before being declared dead			1
officials have said they will use five - times the dose of sedative midazolam in future executions and reduce the number of media witnesses to the punishment from 12 to five			1
the review followed the execution of @entity14 in april who seemed in considerable distress as the drugs were administered			1
as a result , states have been forced to experiment with new combinations , such as the addition of midozolam			0
however , there have been several reports of other ' difficult executions when using the new drug			0
in january , @entity43 inmate @entity42 ' snorted and gasped ' for 26 minutes before dying , while @entity45 inmate @entity44 gasped more than 600 times over almost two hours during his july execution			2
according to @entity48 , professor of surgery at @entity50 , said the use of such a sedative can be problematic			2
he said : ' if you have midazolam he may not respond if he â€™s uncomfortable			0
' a second execution that night was postponed until a review was completed			1
it has been recommended that prison staff should receive additional training and there should be contingency plans in the event of a problem with the execution equipment or the inmate 's medical conditoin			1
an investigation ordered by governor @entity68 conducted by the @entity69 blamed his lengthy death on the poor placement of a single intravenous line in his groin and a decision by the warden to cover the iv site with a sheet			1
the investigation recommended more training for prison staff and a contingency plan , both of which are included in the new procedures			0
the director of the @entity87 , @entity88 , declined to comment on the protocol changes , citing ongoing litigation			0
assistant federal public defender @entity91 , who represents 21 death row inmates who have sued the state @entity87 to block their executions , said the new protocols do not solve @entity1 's execution problems			1
@entity91 said : ' we still do not know what went wrong with mr. @entity14 's execution			1
discovery and fact - finding by the federal courts will address those issues			0
an intravenous line is inserted into each of the prisoner 's arms			1
the drugs are injected by hand held syringes simultaneously into the two iv lines			0
three executioners are used , with one responsible for each of the drugs			0
the condemned criminal is first injected with @entity25 , a strong sedative which causes unconsciousness			2
a second drug , @entity118 is used to stop respiration			0
finally , @entity120 is injected , stopping the prisoner 's heart			2
* @entity123 ' the prisoners still do not have access to information about the source of the drugs , the qualifications of the executioners , or how the state came up with the different drug combinations			0
' under the new guidelines , @entity1 can continue to administer midazolam , a sedative often given to patients before surgery and commonly known as @entity25 , as part of three - drug and two - drug protocols			2
it has also been used illegally as a date - rape drug			0
a normal dose in medical settings is usually less than 5 milligrams			2
@entity1 's previous protocol called for 100 milligrams			2
the new recommended dosage of 500 milligrams matches that of at least one other state , @entity148 , which also uses the drug as part of its procedures			0
@entity91 also said cutting the number of media witnesses ' reduces public accountability and makes the process less transparent			0
' a federal judge had expressed concern earlier this month that @entity1 will not be able to implement new guidelines and training for executions before three inmates are scheduled to die this fall			1
@entity22 , who has been set for execution the same night as @entity14 , is now scheduled to die on november 13			1
inmates are strapped to this gurney at @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity1 before two intravenous lines are attached to their arms and the three drugs are injected into their system @entity1 has also set execution dates for @entity173 on november 20 and for @entity174 on december 4			1
@entity14 's execution raised new concerns about lethal injection drugs and the secretive process many states use to obtain them			1
president @entity181 called the botched execution ' deeply disturbing ' and called for a review of how the death penalty is applied in the @entity185			1
the @entity185 @entity186 ruled in 1972 that death by execution was unconstitutional as it was ' a cruel and unusual punishment '			2
@entity1 passed a new death penalty act in 1977 allowing for execution by lethal injection			1
between 1915 and 2014 @entity1 executed 191 men and three women			0
eighty - two people were electrocuted , with the last use of the electric chair in 1966			0
the first lethal injection was used to kill @entity198 on september 10 , 1990			1
since then 110 people have died by execution			0
one federal prisoner was hanged .			0
