the hunt for the killer of a 65 - year - old @entity3 man shot dead in his @entity5 home has taken a bizarre twist - as it emerged that the victim had assumed the identity of a dead rock star			1
the man was known in the small coastal village of @entity12 as @entity13 - the retired bassist for cult @entity16 band @entity14			1
but the real @entity13 died in @entity18 three years ago , gendarmes discovered after contacting @entity16 police			1
he died in march 2011 after suffering from muscular dystrophy , and the murdered @entity28 who assumed the same name arrived in @entity12 , near the @entity30 of @entity31 , at around the same time , residents say			1
he adopted the look of a seventies rocker ; he had a shaven head and wore a large leather beret , eccentric clothes , @entity38 glasses , @entity40 boots and a belt with a massive shiny buckle			1
locals would ask him to play guitar , but he would always refuse , saying he suffered from severe arthritis in his fingers			2
he was found lying in a pool of blood on sunday morning			2
he had been killed instantly by a bullet which passed through his neck , leaving a gaping wound			1
forensic gendarmes were baffled to find no trace whatsoever of the bullet or signs of a projectile having struck furniture or the walls of the dining room of the house , where the victim lived alone close to an idyllic tourist beach			1
the @entity3 man had been living in a farmhouse in @entity5 for nearly four years before he was murdered the false @entity13 lived in @entity12 , near the @entity30 of @entity31 , where he was popular he used to tell people in the local bar that he was @entity13 , and would describe to them a lifestyle in @entity18 that matched that of the rocker			1
his lifestyle in @entity5 was certainly not in keeping with that of a wealthy retired rock guitarist living in the sun , however			1
he appeared to lead a modest life , walking everywhere and occasionally working as a day labourer in fields collecting onions and cabbages			2
he was even forced to beg for money at @entity31 port , locals said			1
' he was quiet and a pleasant man and well liked			0
he did n't drink heavily and would often just order a coffee and sit at an outside table and smoke a cigarette , ' said a caf√© owner			0
a bartender added that it was believed he had inherited his farmhouse from his uncle : ' his sister who was from @entity92 introduced him to us four years ago and said he was her brother			0
' we got to know him well			0
he was from @entity92 had played in a band as a guitarist in @entity16			2
' he had lived here in his house for four years			0
he inherited the house from his uncle when he died			0
@entity13 's mother was a local @entity100 woman from the village and his father was @entity92			1
' latterly he had had a problem with his hand due probably to arthritis			0
he said he could n't play guitar any more because he could n't move his fingers much			0
he did n't drink a lot and he did n't seem to have a girlfriend			0
he lived alone in the house			0
' a spokesman for the @entity112 said yesterday that they knew the true identity of the man , though could not confirm it yet			2
forensic officers have returned to the murder house and resumed searching for clues in the dining room where the victim died and other areas of the large house , which was described as being ' extremely untidy '			0
investigators have also studied bloody footprints left on the floor of the dining room which are believed to be those of the killer			0
the man named initially as @entity13 by @entity129 was wearing slippers at the time of his death at 11pm last saturday			1
the neighbour who discovered the body on sunday morning did not leave any traces on the floor of the room as the victim 's blood had already dried			0
members of his family from southern @entity92 were said to have arrived in @entity100 yesterday .			2
