watching from his seat up in the @entity2 stands , @entity3 will know @entity4 need to perform better than this once he steps down to the dug - out			1
@entity6 oversaw a second away point in succession as caretaker manager — not to be sniffed at in their predicament			1
but , quite simply , @entity3 must make @entity4 a greater attacking force			1
@entity13 was not called into meaningful action once			2
@entity3 congratulated the players and @entity6 in the dressing room afterwards for their organisation , but told them sparkle is needed to survive			1
@entity71 was the man of the match at @entity2 on @entity73			1
@entity74 is the @entity78 international 's heat @entity75 here for more from our brilliant @entity81 service			2

but we need to add goals to stay up			0
‘ he knows we need a different dimension			0
i ’m sure he will have talked to the chairman about transfers			0
we know we need to bring in players			0
’ @entity27 captain @entity30 goes off injured in the first half to be replaced by @entity97 @entity31 @entity27 goalkeeper @entity13 heads clear to thwart the onrushing @entity23 as @entity28 takes evasive action @entity4 defender @entity48 is closed down by @entity27 striker @entity40 @entity36 ( right ) gets away from @entity4 's @entity56 in the midfield @entity3 is expected to take his first @entity4 training session on friday and @entity6 has been told his services are wanted by the incoming manager , who could be seen in the directors ’ box as the match meandered along			1
no need for notebooks to record the details of this dire game			2
@entity27 ’s role can not be discounted			1
they continued to pass the ball as instructed by @entity46 but moves broke down far too easily , far too frequently			0
their goal tally stays stock still at 11 in 20 @entity119 games , the lowest in @entity121 ’s top four divisions			0
they have failed to score in 12 matches in all competitions this season			0

@entity30 was then forced from the field having injured his knee in a collision with @entity140			0
he suffered a similar problem for @entity142 at the @entity143 , @entity46 said afterwards			0
@entity23 sprinted clear like a 100m runner , away from @entity29 and across @entity31 , but sent his shot smacking against the crossbar			1
alas , that was to be as exciting as it got			0
the rest of the game an affair void of speed , creativity or flow			2
@entity4 had failed to score in four of their last five away games so another blank here was no shock			1
