a 28 - year - old mother was left with thinning locks and bald patches after one too many dye treatments			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , spent her youth bleaching and dyeing her hair so much , that it left her with a bald crown			1
' i must have dyed it about 300 times			0
once i started it became addictive , ' she revealed on @entity14 show bodyshockers			0
@entity4 , pictured after her hair started thinning , began to use styles that hid the bald patches a close up of @entity4 's scalp shows the bald patches she had as a result of dyeing her hair too much the mother - of - one used to work as an assistant in a salon where she would frequently change her hair styles , trying different colours every other week and applying a mass of products to her hair			1
the natural brunette bleached her hair blonde and numerous other shades over the years but the products she used caused her hair follicles to become blocked			1
this meant new hair could n't grow through leaving her with limp locks and bald patches			1
she said : ' i hate my hair , it 's all thinned , you do n't expect it at 28 , it 's awful			2
' the mother - of - one had dyed her hair numerous shades over the years , as pictured left and right , but lived to regret changing her style so often @entity4 was shocked her hair stopped growing and she felt self - conscious about the bald patches , pictured @entity4 said she tried her best to cover the bare spots through styling what hair she had but it made her feel self - conscious			1
she said : ' i was so conscious of my hair loss and trying to cover it up , it became a massive part of my morning routine			1
i never left the house feeling satisfied and felt rubbish for the rest of the day			0
' my hair loss was never far from my mind which had a big effect on my confidence			2
' i 'm always thinking " can people see the bald patches ? " ' she said she tried to find a solution for years and was terrified she 'd go completely bald			1
' i 've tried shampoo and conditioners , lotions from the chemist , hair vitamin tablets			0
i have spent an absolute fortune and nothing works , ' she said			0
she added that she ' totally regrets ' dyeing her hair so much			0
eventually she was referred to @entity74 , a clinician who herself had suffered from hair loss and believed she could help @entity4 with her own condition			1
@entity4 , pictured washing her hair , said she must have dyed it 300 times the brunette said she used to spend hours styling her hair so bald patches would n't show @entity4 said about the consultation : ' @entity82 was amazing			1
i had been to loads of consultations for my hair loss but never truly felt that they understood me			2
that was totally different with @entity82 , knowing she had suffered from hair loss herself i could instantly relate to her and trusted her			2
' for the first time i felt like i was not the only one with hair loss			2
we spoke for over an hour and i finally got the answers i had been wanting for 10 years			0
' @entity82 recommended ' @entity93 ' to @entity4 - which is like a facial for the hair			2
@entity82 explains : ' after speaking with @entity4 about her hair thinning we decided that a @entity93 treatment would be the best course of action to treat her condition			2
@entity102 is massaged into the scalp and works to help rejuvenate the scalp helping to provide a foundation for thicker and fuller hair to grow			0
' for @entity4 's transformation on @entity14 , @entity82 also provided @entity4 with a specialised hair piece to help with her hair loss in the short term and boost her self - esteem			1
@entity4 said the hair piece has made her feel more confident until her natural hair is rejuvenated			0
@entity4 eventually found a solution to her hair loss thanks to meeting specialist @entity74 , right as a temporary measure , @entity4 has been given a hair piece , which she is pictured wearing here , while her scalp is treated to rejuvenate her real hair she said : ' i no longer worry about having to cover my hair loss in the mornings as the system does that for me			1
it makes me feel so much more relaxed for the rest of the day and gives me more important time to spend with my son			0
' @entity4 is also delighted with the @entity102 treatment @entity82 has been able to provide her and feels like she has finally ' seen the light at the end of the tunnel '			0
' the treatment is like a facial for the scalp and feels better than any other treatments i 've had , plus i am already starting to see results			0
i ca n't thank @entity82 enough for helping me finally find a solution , ' she said .			0
