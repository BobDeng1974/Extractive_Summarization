by @entity0 behind the bench : @entity3 district judge @entity2 keeps a personal blog for his legal musings and his latest post decried scantily - clad female lawyers a district judge in @entity9 has written a blog post criticizing the overly sexy way that female judges dress in court			1
judge @entity2 's uses his latest post on his personal blog , @entity16 and @entity17 , to tell unnerving anecdotes about how he is swayed by legal counsel 's hemline length and low - cut blouses			1
' in candor , i have been a dirty old man ever since i was a very young man , ' the 68 - year - old judge writes			2
he goes on to degrade an unidentified female lawyer based on her dress sense			1
' around these parts there is a wonderfully talented and very pretty female lawyer who is in her late twenties			1
she is brilliant , she writes well , she speaks eloquently , she is zealous but not overly so , she is always prepared , she treats others , including her opponents , with civility and respect , she wears very short skirts and shows lots of her ample chest			1
i especially appreciate the last two attributes , ' he wrote			2
he then goes on to give another example of an allegedly inappropriately dressed lawyer but this time says that the criticism came to his attention by way of ' the sisterhood ' of female law clerks that he works with			1
he writes that they ' seethed and sneered ' at the woman 's ' unprofessional ' choice of dress			0
the judge 's proposed solutions for the problem do not help the situation , starting off by writing : ' you ca n’t win			0
men are both pigs and prudes			0
' legal mind : @entity2 , who was given his lifetime appointment by @entity63 in 1992 , wrote about how a lawyer 's short skirts and low - cut shirts are the attributes he admires about her most he finishes by warning women to ' tone it down ' if they ever think that female law clerks ' are likely to label you , like @entity73 , an ignorant slut , ' including a link to a @entity77 skit where @entity78 hurls the insult at @entity80			1
judge @entity2 was appointed to his position by former president @entity63 in 1992			1
because federal judges are appointed for life , he can only leave the bench if he resigns , dies , or is impeached by the @entity86 after being convicted by the @entity87			0
unsurprisingly , the post prompted an immediate backlash and a local columnist for the @entity91 took him to task , and he immediately wrote a somewhat apologetic if not conciliatory second post			0
' if , on balance , you think the post was harmful to the image of the federal judiciary and truly treated women as objects , i am very , very , very sorry for that , but i would ask you to pause and reread it , ' he says , addressing columnist @entity104			0
back in the day : @entity9 - based @entity2 , seen here in 2001 , told women ' you ca n't win			1
men are both pigs and prudes			0
get over it ' ' i hope you will find upon objective reflection that the mockery i make of myself and the hyperbole and somewhat mordant tone i employed , made a point worth considering			0
' this is not the first time that the judge has been arguably overly candid on his blog , which he describes as being a place for his musings on ‘ the role of the federal trial judge ’			0
he told @entity125 to ‘ go to hell ’ during the government shutdown last fall and included a link to the @entity128 definition of ‘ bats * * * ’			2
the @entity132 reports that the judge originally wrote in january that he was going to quit blogging , prompting some to think that this latest post was the result of his site being hacked			2
instead , it appears that he decided to saddle back up to the keyboard and has been particularly prolific this week , following the ‘ dirty old man ’ post with a detailed account of his treatment for @entity145 classic @entity147 ’s lymphoma .			0

@entity3 district judge @entity2 has written a blog post *urging* female lawyers not to wear short skits and low - cut shirts
he wrote about a particular female lawyer in his home state of @entity9 who is talented but her ' ample chest ' is one of his *favorite* attributes
warned that female law clerks will brand inappropriately - dressed lawyers as ' ignorant sl * * s '
@entity2 , who has a lifetime appointment to the bench , has since *defended* his post saying that he was making a mockery of himself and using hyperbole
