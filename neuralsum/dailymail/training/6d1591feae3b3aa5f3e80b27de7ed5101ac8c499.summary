police spied on protesters at @entity4 ’s biggest anti-fracking demonstration , using bugging devices and infiltrating them with undercover ‘ covert human intelligence sources ’ , an official report has revealed			1
the incendiary revelation emerged only because blundering police failed to properly redact the highly sensitive report			0
when a computer user changes the colour of the type , the missing text appears			2
stand - off : police escorting a lorry confront activists from the protest camp in @entity18 , @entity19 that emerged to demonstrate against plans to frack for methane gas on a site just outside the village the existence of ‘ spies ’ in the frackers ’ camp in @entity18 , @entity28 , is meant to be a closely guarded secret			1
@entity28 chief constable @entity30 reportedly ‘ went ballistic ’ when told of the mistake			0
a local private sector security source said : ‘ next time there ’s a fracking protest , activists will know what to expect – to say nothing of the consequences if the intelligence source is discovered			1
’ the report into @entity42 ’s handling of last summer ’s protests at the site where fracking company @entity45 was trying to conduct test drilling was compiled by @entity47			1
@entity42 disclosed it last week under the @entity49 , with the redactions			0
the error was quickly identified			0
the report states that police initially ‘ did not properly anticipate the escalation which did occur ’ , allowing the protesters to almost close down @entity45 ’s operations in july			1
police then used secret intelligence methods			2
the supposedly redacted part of the report says : ‘ once the operation moved into august , it was appropriate that an appropriate range of intelligence sources were being harnessed , including where appropriate @entity67 compliant covert means			0
’ clumsy : @entity42 's attempt at redaction came unstuck as soon as activists changed the colour of the font in word - processing software as a result , it became clear exactly when activists planned to step up their campaign			1
this intelligence was shared with @entity45 – prompting the firm to suspend drilling on days when the protests were expected to peak			1
this was ‘ fully appropriate ’ , the report claims			0
‘ not having informed @entity45 of the anticipated risks would have been negligent on the behalf of @entity42			2
’ yesterday a @entity42 spokesman confirmed that the ‘ covert means ’ were those set out under the @entity87 – the use of @entity89 ( @entity90 ) and ‘ electronic interception ’			0
he insisted the inadvertent disclosure ‘ does not compromise the operational effectiveness of our plans			0
we have a responsibility to gather intelligence to assess risk and build plans to keep people safe ’			0
but @entity102 , campaigns and policy director for @entity105 , said he was appalled that ‘ covert resources are being wasted on people exercising their democratic right to protest ’			2
@entity109 , from solicitors @entity110 , who are trying to stop @entity18 fracking through the @entity112 , said : ‘ if police were using covert means , such as electronic bugging , this is deeply concerning			0
' such seemingly excessive and intrusive police surveillance only serves to undermine our democracy and is a further erosion of people ’s lawful right to protest			1
’ @entity45 chief executive @entity122 said he had ‘ no knowledge ’ of the covert methods , adding : ‘ this is not a matter for us , but the police			1
