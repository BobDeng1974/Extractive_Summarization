mr and mrs @entity116 argue it is vital that all children are screened for the disease at birth			0
they have so far raised a staggering Â£ 4,000 to help their son realise the bucket list			1
mrs @entity116 said : ' the things we are generally doing with @entity4 are n't out of the ordinary			2
' they are things we would have done with him anyway while he was growing up , but we just have to squeeze it in to such a short space of time while he is aware			0
' we want him to enjoy it and be aware of what is happening			0
' sadly his symptoms have been very rapid			0
we do n't know what the future looks like but we have to take each day as it comes			0
' every little cold could be it , we just do n't know			0
' we know @entity4 is not going to see four , five or six			2
' the doctors told us he may have between 18 months and four years			0
' she said the family are hoping to visit @entity97 soon to tick off more of @entity4 's list , including a ride on a red open top bus and the @entity146 as well as meeting @entity147 star @entity73 and characters from @entity149			1
' we want him to ride a bike , it 's something every child should do , but the practicalities of all of the wishes are quite difficult , ' mrs @entity116 added			2
' i do n't know if we can find a bike sit that will work for him			0
' the 29 - year - old said if her son had been screened for @entity31 disease with a pin - prick test at birth , it may have allowed time for a potentially life - saving bone marrow transplant			2
doctors have told the family the procedure was too expensive			0
mrs @entity116 first noticed her son was struggling to walk last november , and took him to see a gp			0
they suspected @entity4 was going through a ' phase ' , but a month later his condition appeared to be deteriorating and reaching a the point where he could only crawl			1

they are pictured here with attacking midfielder @entity181 @entity4 , now 20 months , was also given the chance to meet @entity183 , left and @entity184 , right mrs @entity116 , said : ' sadly his symptoms have been very rapid			1
we do n't know what the future looks like but we have to take each day as it come ' his mother took him to @entity191 four times , before doctors ordered an mri scan			0
the toddler was referred to the @entity196 in @entity65 , where on christmas eve a specialist revealed @entity4 was seriously ill. @entity31 disease is typically diagnosed in the first year of life			1
it is a genetic condition that causes patients to rapidly regress to a point where they have little to no brain function			1
those diagnosed with the condition rarely live beyond the age of two , many dying as a result of respiratory infection or brain fever			2
symptoms of @entity31 disease include : in general , the earlier a child is diagnosed with the disease , the more rapid its progression			2

source : @entity219 the formal diagnosis of @entity31 disease was made three weeks later			0
' i do n't know what was going through my head when the doctor told us on @entity226 , ' mrs @entity116 said			0
' you just do n't eve expect to be told this when your son has been happy and healthy for 17 months			0
' if we had learned of this disease from an earlier point it would n't have been easier but it would not have been such a shock thinking everything was fine and normal for all that time			0
' she said up to the point where doctors diagnosed the disease , @entity4 was a ' normal ' baby , going to play group three times a week			1
' he was such a clever and active baby , going to water babies till he was 14 months old , ' she added			0
' if we were given the option at birth to be screened and found out he had it then we would have had the option of a bone marrow transplant , which could have given him a normal life			0
' it 's too late now			0
' ' we had 17 months of thinking he was fine			0
it only takes a heel pin - prick test			0
' i asked why they do n't do it and they told me it was due to cost			0
cost does not come into it with the lives of children			0
' a fundraising page for @entity4 reads : ' @entity264 , @entity13 and our family have made an agreement that @entity4 's life will continue as normal but in the short time that we may have we plan to achieve a lot , we have therefore created a bucket list for him that we hope people can support and assist us in achieving where possible			1
' there is no treatment for this disease however if diagnosed early then there are potentially life - saving options available to those children			1
we are told that @entity4 's symptoms are too progressed for this to be an options , however if detected early enough he may have been			1
