by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 21 february 2013 adrift on the high seas without food or water for a month , the bodies of scores of starved asylum seekers who had been trying to reach @entity4 were thrown overboard from a ‘ ship from hell '			1
their starving and dehydrated companions , almost too weak to lift the dead from the disabled vessel as it drifted in the @entity16 , were rescued by the @entity18 navy – but several were today struggling for life after being brought ashore			1
only 32 of the original 130 @entity20 on board were alive when naval ships reached them , many of the emaciated passengers too weak to stand			1
emaciated : starving and dehydrated passengers have been rescued from the ship which drifted in the @entity16 describing the vessel as a ‘ ship from hell ’ , a @entity18 government spokesman said the group had set out from @entity20 two months ago to sail to @entity33 and then on to @entity4 , where they planned to ask for asylum			1
but a few days later the vessel broke down and began what for most of those on board was to prove to be a fatal drift with the ocean currents			2
they had set out with enough food and water to last for a month , but when no rescue came and their supplies ran out , the passengers began to collapse with hunger and dehydration as the days and weeks went by			1
when they began dying and the stifling conditions under the tropical sun made living with the dead intolerable , their fitter companions had no other choice but to throw the bodies overboard			1
the survivors told the @entity18 authorities , who found the boat drifting 380 miles off the country ’s eastern coast , that they were @entity60 from a border village lying between @entity20 and @entity62			1
‘ their captain and 97 others have died due to deydration and starvation , ’ said @entity18 police spokesman mr @entity63			0
‘ they said they had thrown the dead bodies into the sea			1
’ @entity4 ’s immigration minister , @entity71 , who has received a briefing from the @entity18 authorities , said the tragedy underlined the danger of getting on people smugglers ’ boats and making the perilous journey to @entity4			2
‘ it is the people smugglers who have lured people onto unseaworthy vessels , ’ he told @entity78 today			0
‘ it ’s the people smugglers who peddle lies to these people , take their life savings , sometimes sadly take their lives			0
that ’s where i target the blame			0
’ mr @entity71 , who took the immigration role only earlier this month , added : ‘ a lot of people are just disappearing , out of sight , out of mind			2
boats disappearing – it ’s very hard to put a number on it			0
’ mr @entity71 said stopping boats carrying desperate asylum seekers could not be done quickly			0
under the previous @entity101 government of @entity102 the number of boats heading to @entity4 was just a trickle because word had got out among people smugglers that the vessels would be turned away from @entity4 waters and those on board would be sent to other nations for processing			2
but under the @entity115 government , elected in november 2007 and headed today by @entity113 - born prime minister @entity112 , more than 33,000 people have arrived by boat on @entity4 ’s outlying islands			2
mr @entity71 said boat arrivals were a ‘ constant pressure ’ for successive governments			0
‘ this can not be done overnight			0
it can only be done over time , ’ he said .			0
