' @entity6 serves with the @entity52 @entity54 's @entity53 and colour sergeant @entity55 requested maximum attendance at the drill hall last night to discuss cadet safety after the attack			1
well - wisher @entity60 posted on the cadet 's @entity62 page : ' it 's beyond being human attacking a soldier in the street ( @entity68 ) but attacking a child ! ' what kind of inhumane person would do such a thing			2
i hope the cadet makes a fully recovery and it does n't deter him from selling poppies in the future			1
' @entity17 bosses condemned the attack and said : ' the @entity17 is appalled to hear of this act of violence against one of our poppy collectors in @entity14			1
the offender , described as black or @entity87 , 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark top , walked off from the bus stop in @entity14 without saying a word			1

' at this stage of our inquiries , we 're keeping an open mind as to what motivated the offender to commit such an act			0
' given the initial description we have of the offender , it may be that he was under the influence of something but whatever his motivation , his violent actions could have scarred this young man for life			2
' ' it is pure luck that he did not sustain more serious burns to his face and body			1
' understandably , both he and his family are in a state of total shock and can not believe someone would do this			0
' we need to find who ever is responsible for this crime and i would therefore appeal to anyone who has information			0
