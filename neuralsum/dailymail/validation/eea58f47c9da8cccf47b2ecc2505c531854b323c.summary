damaging splits have opened in the upper ranks of the @entity3 party over @entity5 ’s plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration			1
the prime minister and home secretary @entity9 have become increasingly isolated in their determination to fix a new measure for bringing net migration under control			1
mr @entity5 is considering including two different targets in next month ’s manifesto – including a specific target to slash net migration from outside the @entity19 , which , unlike @entity19 migration , ministers can fully control			1
@entity3 rift : splits have opened in the upper ranks of the @entity25 over @entity5 ’s plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration - with the prime minister and @entity9 becoming increasingly isolated he is also expected to re-state his commitment to sharply reducing overall net migration			1
but senior figures , including chancellor @entity31 , health secretary @entity32 and communities secretary @entity33 are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea			1
it follows the failure of mr @entity5 ’s 2010 pledge to reduce overall net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
last week , the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the @entity19 of 190,000			1
left - wing @entity25 outside of the @entity43 , who are in favour of a more relaxed borders policy , have seized on the figures as their moment to strike			2
they believe that , in the wake of this shuddering failure , it is easier to make the case for scrapping the target altogether			0
yesterday , ex-cabinet minister @entity54 said : ‘ we will have to drop the target			2
it would not be possible to achieve it without damaging our economy quite severely			0
i ’m afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake			1
’ @entity31 is said to be among thoseto to have voiced doubts about the prime minister 's idea @entity65 , a former @entity66 minister , added : ‘ if you set yourself unrealistic targets , you are setting yourself up to fail and , in the long term , turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the government ca n’t get a grip			1
’ but mrs may is understood to believe that giving up on the target would be a huge error , not least because immigration still ranks in the top two concerns of voters			2
she recently resigned from the advisory board of a prominent @entity3 think tank , called @entity83 , which has publicly criticised the idea of a migration target			2
in a report , the right - of - centre organisation declared : ‘ putting an unreliable cap on net migration centre - stage has meant that other measures of competency have been missed and unnoticed			1
’ its findings were given positive coverage in both the left - wing @entity94 and independent newspapers			2
one senior government source , who supports the migration target , said : ‘ this is the coming fight in the party – liberal metropolitans versus people who have lived in the real world			1
’ illegal migrants run on october 29 , 2014 behind a truck to try to board it in @entity107 last october over the past five years , mrs may has introduced a series of policies to bring migration from outside the @entity19 under control			1
these included a crackdown on bogus students and sham marriages			0
however , plans to go further – including the introduction of bonds for visitors – were blocked by the @entity119 and the @entity120			0
yesterday , immigration minister @entity121 , an ally of mrs may , dropped strong hints a target would feature in the manifesto so that ‘ people can measure ’ progress made in cutting immigration			2
he said : ‘ we do believe very strongly that net migration matters			1
long - term figures will show you that net migration to this country over the long term has been in that below the 100,000 figure			1
so , we ’re looking very carefully and we will be coming back so people can measure us on what success looks like in terms of our migration policy			0
’ he added : ‘ the prime minister has said that we will come back and set out what you can measure us on – because that ’s the key thing – on how we perform , on controlling our immigration system			2
’ the number of migrants in @entity107 has dropped by two thirds in recent weeks – suggesting many have managed to dodge border controls and reach @entity151			0
the latest figures reveal that some 2,500 @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity156 @entity155 were in the @entity158 port town over the @entity160 period but that number has now fallen to around 1,000			0
break for the border : migrants try to get into a lorry as it fills up with fuel near @entity107 last night it emerged that on one day in january alone a fire in the town caused chaos and allowed 300 migrants to sneak through the @entity172			0
a winter storm also caused major problems for border officials when a large section of fencing was blown down near the truck parking area			0
hundreds more have succeeded in stowing away on trucks and vehicles from @entity158 ports such as @entity182 and @entity183 where border controls are less stringent			0
in recent weeks albanian people smugglers have moved their profitable operations down the coast from @entity107 and managed to load a number of migrants on to lorries at motorway rest areas			0
a recent head count in @entity107 revealed that only around 1,000 @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity156 @entity155 are now sleeping rough and in squats and at three open air camps in @entity107			0
shortly after @entity160 when a similar survey was carried out the number was put at some 2,500			0
the @entity158 newspaper @entity197 reported over the weekend : ‘ it is difficult to estimate the number of migrants present in @entity107 but one thing is certain – it has decreased significantly			0

@entity202 is expected to re-state commitment to sharply reduce net migration
but senior figures including @entity31 , are voicing doubt over idea
in 2010 campaign mr @entity5 pledged to reduce overall net migration to ‘ tens of thousands ’
last week the figure hit 300,000 - with 190,000 from outside the @entity19
