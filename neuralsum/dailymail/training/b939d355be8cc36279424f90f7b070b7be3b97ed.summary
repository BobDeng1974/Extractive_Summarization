by @entity0 when @entity2 came off the bench , in the 62nd minute , the @entity1 were a goal down to @entity5 , and struggling to make an impression			1
in the hour leading up to his introduction , the @entity7 had managed just two shots on target , both from outside the box			0
within six minutes of his arrival , @entity2 's side , inspired by the man who has led the line for them for so many years , had overturned the deficit and led 2 - 1			1
faced with a twin threat , the @entity5 centre - backs were far less assured			1
before @entity2 came on they had just allowed one succesful cross into the box in over an hour			1
with the former @entity44 man on the pitch the @entity1 completed 4 crosses , two of which resulted in goals			0
@entity2 was not fully fit , which is why he did n't start in against @entity5 , but he could be set for a long - term role coming off the bench			1
he and @entity24 , scorer of the @entity1 equalizer , struggle to play together - in the sixteen minutes where they were both on the pitch @entity24 touched the ball just five times			2
and manager @entity60 suggested that the older man could be used as an impact substitute			2
happy : @entity63 ( left ) and @entity23 celebrate @entity1 's win three points : @entity2 took to @entity66 to share a montage from saturday 's match ' part of leaving him on the bench was to do with strategy , part of it was his fitness , ' @entity60 said			1
' the last time he played 90 minutes was a few months ago in @entity75 and he 's had an injury since then			1
' ' when @entity2 came on the pitch everything changed , ' @entity77 told reporters			1
' when you have this calibre of player on the pitch you are very lucky			0
' of course , he was frustrated to be on the bench but if you saw the joy when he finished the match ... he is a champion			0
' the striker himself expressed his disappointment at being left out , but said he is motivated in any role for his country			0
' i was disappointed ( not to start ) , ' the 36 - year - old @entity2 said to @entity94 newspaper @entity93			1
' but i have to show my respect to those that started			0
back in the game : @entity24 ( right ) heads home to put @entity1 on level terms here we go : @entity24 celebrates with this team - mates @entity2 and @entity63 after making it 1 - 1 ' when i went in , i just wanted to help the team to win the match and i did not need this disappointment in order to be motivated			2
' i do n't know how long i played but i knew it was important to give something extra to the team			0
' @entity5 were n't very dangerous but we trailed and had to come from behind to win			2
' it is a beautiful victory and we are happy with the result , ' the @entity112 forward said			0
' we 've prepared for many weeks for this game and it was important to start the competition on the right foot			0
' this result will be very important especially if we play a good game against @entity121			0

@entity2 's entry prompted a two goal *turnaround* within six minutes
@entity2 's presence enough to worry the @entity5 defence
striker could be kept on the bench as an impact sub
