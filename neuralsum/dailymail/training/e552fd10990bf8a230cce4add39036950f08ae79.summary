by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 04:45 est , 4 may 2012 the backlash against boardroom greed spread from @entity4 ’s banks to the rest of the @entity6 yesterday as ordinary shareholders rose up against fat cat pay deals			1
bosses at insurance giant @entity10 were left humiliated after their multi-million pound bonuses were rejected by investors at their annual meeting			1
and last night @entity14 , chief executive of @entity16 newspaper group , was forced out after weeks of criticism from investors and shareholders about her £ 1.7million pay package			1
yesterday ’s outpouring of anger at the lavish pay packages afforded to @entity10 executives follows a string of embarrassing rebukes against other firms			1
anger : @entity30 ' chief @entity29 's pay jackpot this year has ignited a furious battle with investors , while @entity16 boss @entity14 , right , was forced out after weeks of criticism from shareholders last week , @entity30 also received a bloody nose , with 31.4 per cent of shareholders failing to back its pay and perks			1
this included a package of up to £ 26.6million for its chief executive @entity29			0
on tuesday , mining giant @entity45 received a protest vote of 39 per cent over its remuneration report , which sanctioned a package worth £ 6million for its boss @entity49			1
but the @entity10 result – described as symptomatic of a ‘ tsunami of revulsion ’ against fat cat pay – meant the @entity56 - based firm became the first blue chip company to receive a majority ‘ no ’ vote from shareholders over its pay and perks since the credit crunch			1
@entity10 chairman @entity64 was also lambasted by one shareholder for failing to sack chief executive @entity66 after revelations emerged in 2009 of an office affair			1
last night @entity69 , chairman of the @entity70 , said : ‘ the rebellion is spreading from the banks to other businesses			0
‘ shareholders are finally taking more of a stand and waking up to the fact they have been ripped off			0
this is a result of the economic times we ’re living in			0
storm : earlier this week mining giant @entity45 received a protest vote of 39 per cent over its remuneration report , which sanctioned a package worth £ 6million for its boss @entity49 ‘ businesses just ca n’t afford to look like they ’re living on a different planet from the rest of us			1
’ @entity10 has been dragged into the firing line after dishing out pay packages worth up to £ 5.2million to its chief executive @entity66 and £ 4.2million for his @entity91 right - hand man @entity90 , who only joined the firm in december			1
this included a ‘ controversial ’ £ 2.5million ‘ golden hello ’ payment			0
almost 60 per cent of votes failed to back the insurer ’s remuneration report , which sanctioned the payments			2
some 54 per cent – which came from private shareholders and giant pension funds – actively protested against the insurer ’s multi-million pound bonuses			2
@entity10 , which has 14million customers in the @entity4 after swallowing up @entity106 , joined the ranks of state - backed @entity108 and oil giant @entity109 which both faced rebellions at the height of the financial crisis in 2009			2
@entity113 , the @entity115 peer who has campaigned against excessive pay in the @entity6 , said the move showed the need for government reforms which will give shareholders formal power to stop excessive pay deals			1
currently , companies can ignore shareholders ’ pleas for restraint			0
but @entity113 added : ‘ a tsunami of shareholder anger is now hitting overpaid and underperforming big businesses			2
although @entity30 boss @entity29 is “ mr greedy ” personified , the revolt is rightly going wider			1
’ the humiliation at @entity10 comes despite repeated attempts to head off a rebellion , including promises of pay reform and @entity66 waiving a 4.8 per cent pay rise that would have nudged his salary above £ 1million			2
the issue of bonuses at @entity10 has become particularly toxic as its shares have slumped by more than a fifth			0
mounting resentment finally spilled over at @entity146 ’s @entity145 as the firm jousted with shareholders at its annual meeting			0
ordinary investors in the audience , many of them pensioners , ripped into the spiralling pay enjoyed by @entity10 ’s top brass			1
one private shareholder also questioned the morality of the company ’s boardroom , referring to revelations of mr @entity66 ’s affair			0
addressing the chairman , @entity64 , who backed mr @entity66 over the scandal , @entity161 said : ‘ your failure to deal with this brings shame on you			0
’ another shareholder , @entity167 , said : ‘ our board members are more concerned about their own remuneration than growing the business			0
’ @entity10 has pledged to review its bonus scheme , but its executives will not lose their bonuses despite the vote as it is not binding on the company			2
@entity113 added : ‘ business secretary @entity178 ’s proposals for binding shareholder votes on top pay packages must now be passed into law to stop shareholders who own our companies from just being toothless tigers			0
’ last night @entity186 , shadow treasury minister said : ‘ shareholders are properly beginning to exercise their powers on our behalf			0
‘ senior executives need to recognise the ordinary households who are having to tighten their belts in the recession			0
