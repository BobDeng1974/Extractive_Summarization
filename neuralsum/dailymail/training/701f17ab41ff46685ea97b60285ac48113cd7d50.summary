by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 13:00 est , 14 june 2012 @entity2 's oldest cave artwork was today confirmed to be at least 40,800 years old			1
the @entity4 paintings in northern @entity5 have been precisely dated for the first time , proving the art form began in @entity2 10,000 years earlier than previously thought			1
this means the cave paintings were created by either the first anatomically modern humans in the area - first thought to exist 41,500 years ago - or by @entity12			2
record - breaker : the ' @entity15 ' artwork in the @entity17 cave in northern @entity5			1
made by blowing or spitting paint onto the wall , scientists have estimated the art to be at least 40,800 years old the paintings were created by either the first anatomically modern humans in the area - first thought to exist 41,500 years ago - or by @entity12 scientists were able to work out the age of the paintings by dating the formulation of tiny stalactites on top of the art using the radioactive decay of uranium			2
they examined a total of 11 caves in northern @entity5 , including the @entity33 of @entity34 , @entity17 and @entity35			1
hand stencils and disks made by blowing paint onto the wall in the @entity17 cave proved to date back to at least 40,800 years			2
this makes them the oldest known cave art in @entity2 - up to 10,000 years older than previous examples from @entity45			1
a large club - shaped symbol in the polychrome chamber at @entity34 was found to be at least 35,600 years old , showing that painting started there 10,000 years earlier than previously thought too			1
@entity51 found that the cave was revisited and painted a number of times over a period spanning more than 20,000 years			2
the creation of art is considered important to the evolution of modern cognitions and symbolic behaviour , and could be associated with the development of language			0
dr @entity62 , of the @entity63 , said : ' we see evidence for earlier human symbolism in the form of perforated beads , engraved egg shells and pigments in @entity71 70,000 to 100,000 years ago , but it appears that the earliest cave paintings are in @entity2			1
' one argument for its development here is that competition for resources with @entity12 provoked increased cultural innovation from the earliest groups of modern humans in order to survive			0
' alternatively , cave painting started before the arrival of modern humans , and was done by @entity12			0
' that would be a fantastic find as it would mean the hand stencils on the walls of the caves are outlines of @entity12 â€™ hands , but we will need to date more examples to see if this is the case			0
' gathering evidence : @entity63 researchers remove samples from paintings in @entity35 cave in @entity100 , @entity5 , for radioactive dating dr @entity62 removes calcite crusts in the ' @entity103 ' inside the @entity17 cave social history : the creation of art is important to the evolution of modern cognitions and symbolic behaviour , and could be associated with the development of language the scientists were forced to use the uranium method as the paintings lacked organic pigments or binders suitable for radiocarbon dating			1
and even if there was organic material - such as charcoal pigments - only small samples can be used for dating to minimise damage			0
this can cause contamination , leading to an inaccurate result			0
instead , the international team measured uranium isotypes in the thin calcite flowstone growths which had formed on the surfaces of the paintings to date the art. the method , known as uranium - series disequilibrium , is used in @entity136 to accurately date ancient objects			0
dr @entity138 , of the @entity139 for the @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity5 , said : ' the key development was our method to date tiny tiny calcium carbonate deposits similar to stalactites			2
' we can now date samples of just ten milligrams - about as small as a grain of rice			0
this has allowed us to find samples that had formed directly on top of hundreds of paintings , whereas the larger stalactites were much less frequent			0
' @entity156 art specialist dr @entity155 , of the @entity157 , said : ' until now our understanding of the age of cave art was sketchy at best ; now we have firmly extended the earliest age of @entity2 cave art back by several thousand years , to the time of the last @entity12 and earliest homo sapiens			1
' these earliest images do not represent animals , and suggest that the earliest art was non-figurative , which may have significant implications for how art evolved			0

the *palaeolithic* paintings in northern @entity5 have been precisely dated for the first time
the results proving that cave art was first painted in @entity2 10,000 years earlier than previously thought
