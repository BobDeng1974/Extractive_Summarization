by @entity0 @entity1 experienced post-traumatic stress disorder after staying on an intensive care unit @entity1 knew it would take time to recover after major cancer surgery			1
doctors had found cancerous cells in his oesophagus , or gullet , and planned to remove it and reattach his stomach to his throat			1
@entity1 would spend at least a week in hospital , including a stint in intensive care			1
full recovery could take a year and his digestion would be permanently affected			2
' i approached the operation with some trepidation , ' says @entity1 , a father of five , who works with children with autism			1
' but i still saw it as a cure			2
' although @entity1 , 61 , prepared himself for the physical aftermath , he never dreamed the experience in february last year would affect his mental health			1
however , as a result of his time in intensive care , he developed post-traumatic stress disorder and depression , from which - more than a year later - he is only just starting to recover			1
astonishingly , every year up to 50,000 people in @entity37 suffer the same experience after a stay in intensive care , also known as critical care			2
patients are moved to these wards during major illness , or after injury or surgery , and are placed on specialised monitoring equipment , with one highly trained nurse per patient			1
to help recovery , these patients are often put on organ support - for example , breathing through a ventilator - and may have drips and lines attached			2
the majority are also given powerful sedating drugs to reduce pain and make them more comfortable , aiding their recovery			2
but these medications can cause disturbing hallucinations and delusions			2
when combined with major surgery or illness and perhaps coming close to death , this can leave people with a degree of trauma similar to that seen in those returning from a battlefield , say experts			1
often , patients are simply not prepared for these delusions , and have been known to become violent or even call the police from their hospital bed			1
when @entity1 came round after his surgery at @entity79 ( @entity79 ) , he was completely unprepared for what he saw and heard			1
' the first thing i was aware of was seeing colours and shapes - like a psychedelic painting but on a grand scale , ' says @entity1 , who lives with his wife , @entity87 , in @entity88			1
' but this was minor compared with other images i was having			2
' @entity1 was convinced he 'd been taken to @entity91 to be questioned for information and the hospital ward had been recreated there to fool him			1
he even thought his wife and son were imposters			2
' i asked @entity87 to show me her hysterectomy scar , and to see my son 's bank card , thinking that would catch them out , ' he says			2
' @entity87 found it very upsetting , particularly because no one explained this was common			2
' he was being treated at @entity79 last year and still suffers some flashbacks the plan was for @entity1 to spend three days on intensive care after surgery , but he caught pneumonia and had to stay for a further seven days			1
he was put on a ventilator , as well as having drips and lines inserted			2
he was also given painkilling and sedating drugs			2
his delusions continued day and night			2
as well as his @entity91 dramas , @entity1 hallucinated about going to a hospital talk about assisted suicide , and saw other patients take their own lives or be helped to die by the doctors and nurses with lethal injections			1
in reality , he was bed - bound and heavily sedated			2
when doctors reduced the sedation , @entity1 woke up but the hallucinations continued			1
' i could see people throwing themselves off the top of a canyon and hear the thuds of the bodies			0
these images are still with me			0
i did n't dare talk to the medical staff - in my mind they were all enemies			0
' at one point , though he does n't remember it , he told his wife he was going to commit @entity143 ten days , @entity1 was moved to a high dependency ward ( one level below intensive care )			1
two weeks later , he was finally allowed to go home			0
he was now just on paracetamol , but was still haunted by hallucinations			0
' i was starting to realise these things could not have happened			0
but i still got flashbacks every day , ' he says			0
' i felt very depressed and started wondering if i was going mad			0
' doctors have long known that intensive care can traumatise patients			0
however , a 2012 study at @entity79 found the problem may be far more common than thought			0
' more than half of patients in the study who had been on intensive care suffered clinical depression , anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder , ' says dr @entity165 , a psychologist at the hospital			1
this would equate to 50,000 patients nationwide every year			0
' for some people this distress will fade with time , but there are studies showing the problem continues at 12 months , ' adds dr @entity174			1
' one study showed that , at two years , 40 per cent of patients had clinical depression			1
i 've encountered people having terrible flashbacks and nightmares ten years later			0
' the drugs given to intensive care patients are similar to those used to put a patient to sleep for surgery			1
but they are administered for longer periods , and as the patient 's organs may not be functioning properly , they are not broken down and stay in the body , leading to delusions			0
dr @entity174 's study found patients who received benzodiazepines - a class of tranquilliser drug that includes @entity199 - were at high risk of psychological problems			0
patients who suffered a high level of distress in intensive care and those with a history of depression or anxiety suffer more , too			1
the trauma can be debilitating , affecting work , relationships and family life ; some patients require therapy and antidepressants			0
dr @entity217 , clinical director of critical care at @entity79 , says : ' if you come through intensive care , people say you 're lucky to be alive			0
but patients do n't see it that way if they are experiencing daily troubling flashbacks			0
intensive care teams are minimising use of sedative drugs because of their psychological consequences ' many say the psychological problems are worse than the physical illness they had to start with			0
we have patients who wo n't go through further planned surgery because they ca n't face more trauma			1
' @entity79 is one of a minority of hospitals that offer an appointment with a psychologist to post-intensive care patients who have had a long stay			0
@entity1 was invited to such a session last august last , six months after his operation			1
' they said i had borderline post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline depression , ' he recalls			1
' they explained this was a common problem and was the result of the drugs i 'd been given			1
once i saw it was a normal thing , and understood the cause , things got easier			0
' he was also invited to have a tour of the intensive care ward			0
' it helped put things in place because it was very different from my memories of the ward			0
' @entity1 was offered counselling but decided with his doctors that it was not necessary			1
intensive care teams are now moving towards minimising the use of sedative drugs because of their psychological consequences			0
dr @entity174 and dr @entity217 are taking part in a Â£ 2 million study in 24 intensive care units to test ways of stopping psychological problems			0
staff will be trained in ' psychological first - aid ' - learning to talk to patients in a calming way to reduce trauma and help them understand why they are having delusions			0
patients with extreme stress will also have cognitive behavioural therapy on the ward			1
@entity1 is now doing well and is back at work part - time			1
but he thinks the @entity79 trial is urgently needed			0
' a little bit of forewarning would have helped			0
it would n't have stopped it happening , but i would have been able to put it into context a bit quicker			0
