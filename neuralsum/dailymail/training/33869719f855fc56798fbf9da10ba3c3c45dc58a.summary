by @entity0 published : 08:05 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 3 october 2013 little did they know when this sheet of paper was signed off that the worst case scenario would come true just 15 days later			0
the original insurance certificate covering the ‘ total loss ’ of the @entity7 for $ 5million ( £ 3.1million ) was revealed today , showing the cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sank in april 1912			1
and a handwritten amendment at the foot of the policy suggested the ship ’s owners only insured the vessel for her sea trials and delivery journey from @entity19 to @entity20 as an afterthought			1
document : the original insurance certificate covering the ' total loss ' of the @entity7 for $ 5million ( £ 3.1million ) was revealed today , showing the cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sunk in april 1912 the trials were due to take place in march but were delayed , possibly because she was not insured			1
the document states : ‘ this policy is subject to total loss or constructive total loss of the vessel			1
’ the @entity7 ’s parent company , the @entity33 , received the full insurance payout within 30 days of the disaster in the @entity36 that saw 1,512 lives lost			1
according to the @entity40 policy , the firm had to pay an excess of $ 500,000 ( $ 310,000 )			2
the policy was arranged through brokers @entity42 which assembled a consortium of insurers that each took a share of the risk			0
certificate : the document is being sold at auction in @entity52 , @entity53 , with a pre-sale estimate of £ 15,000 one of the largest of the 77 partners was @entity40 , which paid out $ 100,000 ( £ 62,000 ) of the claim			1
' to our knowledge , it is without equal			0
it is an unremarkable piece of @entity62 paper but it holds the key to $ 5million ' @entity64 , auctioneer @entity40 went bust in 2011 following massive insurance pay outs in the wake of the 9/11 bombings in @entity70 and @entity71 interesting and historic documents from its archives were put into an exhibition in @entity70 last year which is when the @entity7 ledger was purchased by a dealer			1
he is now selling it at auction in @entity52 , @entity53 , on october 19 with a pre-sale estimate of £ 15,000			0
fateful journey : the @entity7 leaves from @entity20 on her maiden voyage on april 10 , 1912			1
during the voyage , the @entity7 hit an iceberg and sank off @entity88 @entity64 , of auctioneers @entity89 and son , said : ‘ this is the one and only document that exists today relating to the insurance for @entity7			1
claims for the @entity7 totalled £ 16million - the equivalent of £ 1.7billion in today 's money			1
the life insurance policy payout to the wife of @entity100 , a prominent businessman from @entity101 , who drowned in the disaster , was the largest of its time - at £ 31,000			2
strangely , his wife died on the same day as when the ship went down - 32 years later on april 15 , 1944			2
@entity108 , who survived , claimed £ 3,100 for his @entity110 vehicle that sank with the ship			1
this became the first ever claim for a car damaged in a collision with an iceberg			0
@entity33 paid out around £ 2.5million to @entity7 claimants - £ 2.2million to @entity119 claimants and £ 400,000 to @entity120			2
however , people in the @entity120 originally filed claims totalling £ 10million - so only a fraction of this was eventually paid out			0
‘ to our knowledge , it is without equal as we have been unable to locate any other such documents			0
it is an unremarkable piece of @entity62 paper but it holds the key to $ 5million			0
‘ looking back , the words “ total loss ” seem slightly prophetic , given just how soon after the policy was taken out that the ship was lost			1
‘ it is quite extraordinary that the owners of @entity7 received the payout within a month of the disaster , barely after the funerals of the victims had taken place			2
today that process would take months if not years			0
’ those who either drowned or froze to death in the titanic disaster died mainly because there were not enough lifeboats on the ship and those that were used were half - empty			0
the crew of the ship had also failed to heed warnings of ice in the @entity36 and were sailing at speed through an ice field when it struck the huge iceberg			0
mr @entity64 said : ‘ while the @entity7 ’s owners were swiftly recompensed , the families of victims who sued for negligence had to wait four years for compensation and even that that totalled $ 663,000			2
‘ if the disaster happened today the owners would very likely be charged with criminal manslaughter and have to pay out millions and millions of pounds in compensation			0

original insurance certificate covered ' total loss ' of @entity7 for $ 5m ( £ 3.1m )
it shows cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sank in april 1912
sea trials were due to take place in march but delayed for unknown reason
this could have been because doomed ship was not insured at that stage
