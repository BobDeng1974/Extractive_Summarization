between 1912 and 2011 , the mass of ice on the summit of the 19,341ft dormant stratovolcano in @entity11 decreased by more than 85 per cent , say researchers with @entity14 's @entity13			2

estimates vary , but several scientists predict it will be gone by 2060			0
the views from the top of @entity3 are as surreal as they are spectacular			1
after ascending through multiple ecosystems — including cropland , lush rainforest , alpine desert , and a virtual dead zone near the summit — climbers can find themselves peering down on a thick blanket of clouds below that seems to stretch endlessly in the distance			0
but in the immediate foreground , ice dominates the view			0
looking north , a shelf - like block of ice with a sharp vertical cliff sits on an otherwise featureless , sand - covered plateau			0
in the other direction , a second ice field spills off the edge of the plateau , down the mountain ’s southern face			2
@entity3 's southern ice field : despite @entity3 's location in the tropics , the dry and cold air at the top of the mountain has sustained large quantities of ice for more than 10,000 years ' we could have ridden a bicycle through the rift ' : @entity15 , a @entity14 glaciologist , who visited the mountain earlier this year , noticed @entity3 's north ice field had separated despite @entity3 ’s location in the tropics , the dry and cold air at the top of the mountain has sustained large quantities of ice for more than 10,000 years			1
at points , ice has completely surrounded the crater			0
studies of ice core samples show that @entity3 ’s ice has persisted through multiple warm spells , droughts , and periods of abrupt climate change			1
rising air temperatures due to global warming could be contributing to the ice loss , researchers say , but a number of other factors are just as important , if not more so			0
an increasingly dry regional atmosphere , for example , is starving the mountain of the fresh snow needed to sustain the ice fields			2
@entity110 air is also reducing cloud cover and allowing more solar energy to warm the ice surfaces			0
dr @entity15 visited @entity3 as part of a research expedition in september this year .			2

@entity3 has sustained large quantities of ice for 10,000 years
samples show ice has survived multiple periods of abrupt climate change
now experts warn that the ice on the mountain could be gone by 2060
