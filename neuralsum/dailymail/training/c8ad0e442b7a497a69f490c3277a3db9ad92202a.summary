by @entity0 in charge : @entity2 remains @entity4 's prime minister today following a leadership ballot in which nobody from the government ran against her @entity2 remains @entity4 's prime minister today after she was re-elected unopposed after calling a leadership ballot			1
her predecessor @entity9 , whom @entity2 ousted in an internal party coup in 2010 , had been expected to attempt to replace her			1
but at the very last moment he announced he would not contest the ballot			0
in what some commentators have described as ' farcical ' it resulted in no vote taking place and @entity17 - born ms @entity2 being re-elected unopposed as leader of the @entity19			1
it is the second time in 13 months that the prime minister had called and survived a leadership election			1
it came after ms @entity2 had earlier delivered a historic national apology in @entity25 to the thousands of unwed mothers who were forced by government policies to give up their babies for adoption over several decades			1
more than 800 people , many of them in tears , heard the apology in the @entity34 of @entity35 and responded with a standing ovation			0
senior minister @entity37 brought leadership unrest to a head earlier today by calling on his government colleagues to sign a petition to force a ballot if @entity2 , who was born in @entity43 in the @entity44 of @entity45 , refused to call one			2
rival : it was thought that @entity9 , pictured , may stand against @entity2			1
however , he announced shortly before the vote that he would not stand moving : @entity4 's prime minister @entity2 , left , is embraced by a woman during the historic national apology in @entity25 the leadership challenge followed months of slipping polls and internal tensions that put her minority @entity19 government on course to be swept away at september elections			1
' this is not personal			0
it 's about the party , the future of the country , ' said senior @entity19 minister @entity37 , calling the challenge to break a deadlock between @entity2 and chief rival mr @entity9			1
@entity2 , who replaced @entity9 in a partyroom coup in june 2010 , has seen her leadership under threat for most of the past two years and her minority government has been unable to turn around a long - running slump in opinion polls , fueled in part by internal instability , as well as flagging economic conditions			1
the conservative opposition led by @entity75 is well ahead in opinion polls and has promised to scrap a 30 percent tax on coal and iron ore mine profits , and to scrap an unpopular tax on carbon , if it wins power			0
touching : @entity4 apologised for the brutal and often illegal forced adoption of tens of thousands of babies born mostly to unmarried mothers between the 1950s and 1970s new chapter : the @entity89 leader 's victory follows months of slipping polls and internal tensions financial markets had little reaction to the news of the leadership ballot			1
the @entity4 dollar was a shade firmer on the day thanks mainly to a surprisingly strong reading of manufacturing from @entity100 , @entity4 's biggest export market			0
the currency was at $ 1.0380 and holding in a very tight range			0
government bonds hardly budged , with investors assuming future borrowing needs would be much the same whichever leader or party was in power			0
during the historic national apology , ms @entity2 said : ' today this @entity25 on behalf of the @entity4 people takes responsibility and apologises for the policies and practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies , which created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering			1
' we acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on fathers and we recognize the hurt these actions caused to brothers and sisters , grandparents , partners and extended family members , ' she said			0
breaking with the past : an @entity135 elder performed a traditional welcome before the politician apologised national shame : unwed mothers were pressured , deceived and threatened into giving up their babies ' we deplore the shameful practices that denied you , the mothers , your fundamental rights and responsibilities to love and care for your children , ' she added			2
overdue : an apology was recommended a year ago @entity2 committed 5 million @entity4 dollars ( $ 5 million ) to support services for affected families and to help biological families reunite			2
a national apology was recommended a year ago by a @entity156 committee that investigated the impacts of the now - discredited policies			2
unwed mothers were pressured , deceived and threatened into giving up their babies from @entity161 until the early 1970s so they could be adopted by married couples , which was perceived to be in the children 's best interests , the @entity156 committee report found			2
the seven - member @entity156 committee began investigating the federal government 's role in forced adoption in 2010 after the @entity4 state parliament apologised to mothers and children for the flawed practices in that state from the 1940s until the 1980s			0
@entity4 was the first of five state and territory governments to apologise for forced adoption			0
@entity4 has eight such governments			0
@entity2 suffered from broncho - pneumonia as a child and moved to @entity4 with her family after her parents were advised that she would benefit from living in a warmer climate .			0

former *pm* @entity9 had been expected to stand against her
but he pulled out of the contest shortly before vote took place
it meant ms @entity2 was re-elected unopposed as leader of @entity19
it is second time in 13 months ms @entity2 has survived leadership election
vote followed national apology to mothers forced to give up their babies
