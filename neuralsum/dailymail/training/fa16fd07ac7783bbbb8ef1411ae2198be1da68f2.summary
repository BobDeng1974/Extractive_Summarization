' it will set the table for the entire military services as to what kind of evidence is necessary to find that someone can cause grievous bodily injury after testing positive for @entity10 , ' said @entity46 , one of his defense attorneys			1
in addition to the @entity10 issue , the military appeals court agreed tuesday to decide whether the evidence was sufficient to find @entity13 committed adultery			1
