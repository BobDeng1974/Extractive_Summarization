' they should support @entity2			2
@entity4 's a terrific lad and served @entity2 ever so well			2
' ( but ) if he was to score the winning goal for @entity8 , it might blow up			2
' @entity35 , now in his second spell with @entity2 , was heralded by all sides of the ground when he returned with @entity39 in the @entity40 last season , but @entity4 is unlikely to be afforded such a welcome			1

@entity4 is respected , but i think there 's a frustration he said one thing and did another			0
' assuming he comes on as a substitute , he 'll get applause and he might have a few chant his name , but i do n't think it will be like @entity35			0
it does n't particularly wind me up , but a number of supporters are wound up			0
' if you fast forward 10 years , i do n't think people will remember that			0
i think they 'll remember the trophies he won and the goals he scored			0
