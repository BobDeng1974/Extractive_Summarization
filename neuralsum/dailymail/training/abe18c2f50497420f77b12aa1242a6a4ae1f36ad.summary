he may have made history by helping @entity3 land on comet @entity4			1
but @entity8 @entity7 scientist dr @entity6 is hopeless at parking and finding his car in large multistorey car parks , according to his sister			1
she described him as ‘ brilliant , ’ but ‘ lacking common sense ’ just hours after this team at the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) guided the @entity3 lander the duck - shaped rock after a four billion mile journey			1
however , his sister has claimed that the scientist is not good at making small everyday life decisions or parking - and finding - his car in carparks dr @entity6 , 40 , is one most important people involved in the @entity7 mission and yesterday became a @entity36 sensation because of his unorthodox appearance , involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet , which he got in january			1
the father - of - two from @entity46 in north east @entity47 now lives in the @entity48 with his wife @entity49 and children @entity51 , 13 and @entity52 , 11			0
his sister @entity53 , 39 told @entity54 that he is a genius but is sometimes so indecisive when making real - life decisions that he is useless			2
‘ he gets so involved in everything that sometimes common sense goes out the window - like losing the car in the car park , silly things			0
‘ if you go out with him you end up going round and round looking for a car parking space ... he does n’t want to make decisions			0
’ his wife admitted that the scientist is terrible at following directions and has lost track of where he has parked his car on many occasions			0
while there was jubilation in mission control yesterday when @entity3 touched down on the comet ’s surface , @entity15 scientists are now concerned about the future of the probe after it was revealed that it is likely stuck in a cave on the surface of the comet - and it may also be on its side			1
the scientist was so positive that the mission to land on the comet would be successful that he got the triumphant moment of landing permanently etched on his body ( pictured )			2
dr @entity6 became a @entity36 sensation thanks to his flamboyant dress sense and colourful body art @entity15 scientists are concerned about the future of the @entity3 probe after it was revealed that the probe is likely stuck in a cave on the surface of the comet - and it may also be lying on its side			1
with limited access to sunlight , and only a maximum of 30 hours of charge in its battery , scientists now face a race against time to get useful data from the probe before it dies - or find a way to recharge its solar panels and keep @entity3 alive			2
if you look at the images we have at the moment , it looks like @entity3 is resting against a very irregular rock ’ , mission director @entity107 told @entity114			2
‘ there is some speculation about it being in a hole … honestly , we have no idea , because we have n’t seen all the images			0
‘ but what is more important is the attitude [ angle ] of the lander , and the clock is ticking for us to find this out			0
’ in a press conference in french @entity15 also added : ' we are in a kind of cave , not a very flat area			2
' and they said that the probe has access to 90 minutes of sunlight every 12 hours - which might be enough to keep it alive			0
with limited access to sunlight and only a maximum of 30 hours of charge in its battery , scientists now face a race against time to get useful data from the probe before it dies - or find a way to recharge its solar panels and keep @entity3 alive			2
experts are now waiting with baited breath for the results of critical tests but said @entity3 is receiving a good signal and has already sent an image back from the comet			2
scientists hope that by analysing the comet ’s surface , it will offer fresh insights into the origins of @entity157 and the solar system			0
dr @entity6 ’s sister revealed that the whole family is ‘ immensely proud ’ of dr @entity6 ’s part in the 25 year mission			1
his daughter sent him a message on @entity36 that reads : ‘ @entity168 ! you ’re famous ! haha how are you doing ? xx ’ to which the scientist replied : ‘ just want to come home n see you lot xxxx ’			0
he has become the poster - child of the ambitious mission after several video appearances wearing flamboyant shirts , showing off his tattoos			2
he was so sure that the mission to land on the comet would be successful that he had the moment permanently etched on his body in january			0
he told @entity181 : ‘ i 'm incredibly confident that we 're going to nail this landing			0
i 'm confident enough to have it drawn on my body			0
’ dr @entity6 , the son of a brick layer , was reportedly told to cover his tattoos at media events in the past , but his appearance seems only to have increased his popularity			1
@entity36 users praised dr @entity6 for being ‘ a proper cool scientist ’ and ‘ definitely not boring ’ after he appeared on the @entity15 live stream and @entity181 wearing a multi-coloured shirt emblazoned with illustrations of glamorous women , which he teamed with shorts , which showed off his tattoos			1
to convince his new team of his dedication , dr @entity6 promised that if @entity200 woke up from its hibernation , he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event			1
this video shows the creation of the tattoo one @entity36 user wrote : ' dr @entity6 is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt , sleeve tattoos			1
rad , ' while another said : ‘ @entity6 causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning			0
’ dr @entity6 studied at the @entity217 and @entity218 , winning a phd in space plasma physics he has worked at the @entity15 since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013			1
the role was a real change from his previous job , which was studying the physics of the northern lights , @entity223 reported			0
professor @entity229 , senior science advisor at @entity15 , who appointed dr @entity6 , said that he took a chance on the young scientist as he would have to come up to speed with the mission quickly and gain the trust of older experts who had been working at @entity15 for decades			1
to convince them of his dedication , dr @entity6 promised that if @entity200 woke up from its hibernation , he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event			1
in january this happened , and a school friend turned tattoo artist etched a reminder of the ambitious mission on his leg			0
in his profile on the @entity249 website , dr @entity6 says : ‘ the opportunity to work on @entity7 was huge and i can not begin to describe the excitement associated with this mission			1
it really is just so cool			0
’ @entity15 has successfully made contact with the @entity3 lander after it separated from the @entity7 spacecraft this morning at 08.35am gmt. it is now heading towards the comet and is expected to attempt to land on the surface at 4pm gmt. pictured right is @entity107 , @entity258 , celebrating making contact @entity7 has chased comet @entity260 – @entity261 through space for more than ten years in what has been described as ' the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever '			1
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles ( 30 km ) away from @entity268			0

dr @entity6 is the @entity23 at the @entity15
he helped made space history by helping @entity3 to land on comet @entity27
his sister has *decribed* him as ' brilliant ' but *bad* at making small decisions
he *trended* on @entity36 after a tv appearance yesterday morning , where he wore a colourful shirt and shorts , which showed off his array of tattoos
one tattoo shows the @entity3 lander touching down on the comet - although the probe has landed on its side in a cave , putting the mission in *jeopardy*
