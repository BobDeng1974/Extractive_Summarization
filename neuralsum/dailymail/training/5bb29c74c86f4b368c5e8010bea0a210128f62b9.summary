by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured attending the @entity2 in 1945 , ordered the @entity3 to be dispatched to @entity4 at four o’clock in the morning @entity6 ’s mother was ordered out of her home at gun point , along with her three sisters and all their neighbours in @entity11			1
forced to leave their possessions , they were herded into a school before being crammed on to railway containers and despatched thousands of miles away to @entity4			1
for they were @entity3 – and the people that did this to them 70 years ago were @entity21 soldiers , acting under orders from @entity1 to clear the @entity23 of all its original inhabitants whom he accused falsely of collaboration with the @entity28			1
nearly half died of disease , hunger or in the ‘ crematoria on wheels ’ , while mosques were destroyed and properties confiscated			2
these shameful expulsions were merely the most brutal chapter in a bloodstained history of @entity21 and @entity40 atrocities against the @entity3			1
now these blighted people – who returned only after the break - up of the @entity40 – find themselves trapped in the nightmare of confronting @entity21 forces once again			1
they are the most vocal opponents in @entity23 of the @entity21 invasion – and for people such as @entity6 , a friendly grandmother of seven , these are terrifying times			1
‘ this feels very scary – we have seen all this before , ’ she told me yesterday			0
‘ when my mother talked about what happened she always had tears in her eyes			0
now i am worried for my children and grandchildren			0
’ such fears are understandable for this 270,000 - strong @entity61 minority , which represents one in seven @entity63			2
they have lived in the region since arriving with @entity66 seven centuries ago			2
most of the rest are @entity21 , who started arriving after @entity69 annexed the peninsula in 1783			1
they have largely welcomed the intervention – but now tensions between the communities are growing as president @entity74 ratchets up pressure			0
@entity77 servicemen gather on the territory of their military unit - protecting it from unidentified troops			0
tartars are now terrified they will have to face @entity21 forces again , writes @entity0 pro-russian activists have been holding up pictures and collecting cash for the families of two people who died in protests last week			1
talk to them , and they soon start alleging @entity3 used tear gas and carried knives – claims that are far from proven			1
yesterday 200 @entity3 women held a demonstration for peace in @entity97 , a suburb of the regional capital @entity99			1
along with their children , they clutched balloons in the colours of @entity77 and held banners saying , ‘ @entity74 : our children are afraid of your protectors ’ and ‘ do not kill ’			0
afterwards , in a symbolic show of support , they took food to @entity77 troops blockaded by @entity21 forces in bases at @entity113 and @entity114			1
there has been hardly any other conspicuous opposition in @entity23 to @entity118 ’s power play			1
tartar leaders refuse to acknowledge the new ‘ puppet government ’ in @entity23 , which has been formed by pro-russian militants and is pushing hard for a separatist referendum			2
self - defence groups have been formed to protect communities , who have long complained of police harassment and economic discrimination			0
a graphic showing the percentage vote for @entity131 president @entity130 in the 2010 election tartar leaders have urged the community not to respond to @entity21 provocation , fearing this is precisely what @entity74 wants to justify his invasion			2
but one local journalist said they were well - organised and could get thousands on the streets of @entity99 within one hour			0
yet they accept they can not fight one of the world ’s best - equipped armies ; indeed , @entity3 are renowned for a record of non-violent resistance			2
instead they have appealed for help to the international community			0
‘ we are very worried because we are not safe and this could lead to war , ’ said a spokesman for the @entity151 of the @entity152 , their representative body			0
others put it more starkly			0
‘ if there is a conflict we will be the first to suffer , ’ said @entity159			0
‘ this could be the new @entity163			0
