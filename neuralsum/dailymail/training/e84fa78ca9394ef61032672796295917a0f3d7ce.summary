it has been an exercise in diplomacy and stealth – a careful negotiation of appearance and reality which can only be revealed now			0
over the past seven days the @entity12 , the law enforcement services of @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity9 , the @entity10 and sheriff ’s office have combined to mount an operation under intense scrutiny – with intense secrecy			1
and for the past seven days the assembled media have abided by the @entity12 ’s requests to maintain that secrecy and to leave unreported the movements of materials and manpower we have witnessed - to ensure that @entity22 , who had access to tv and internet in his underground bunker , did not learn of their plans or get spooked by the growing force around him			1
@entity12 agents built a mock bunker nearby the scene to work out how best to conduct the raid			1
military surveillance equipment - including a camera that was delicately inserted into the bunker - and personnel were used during the standoff			1
ready to go : these heavily - armed agents with the @entity12 's @entity40 gear up with equipment delivered in a @entity43 rental truck moving out : the federal agents were always at the ready and prepared to storm the bunker where little @entity46 was being held heavy equipment : the @entity12 brought in numerous trucks , as well as helicopters , bomb detectors and sophisticated surveillance equipment @entity53 correspondent @entity52 reports that defense secretary @entity54 personally approved the @entity12 using its gear and engineers during the operations			1
a citadel of surveillance has been erected – all unreported until now , all as negotiators hoped for a peaceful outcome			0
however , it was the @entity12 's elite @entity40 , and not @entity64 troops that , that stormed the bunker and recused five - year - old @entity46			1
within hours of survivalist @entity68 ’ shooting of school bus driver @entity22 and his abduction of the boy , the @entity12 became involved			1
with their arrival came an abrupt shut down of communications			0
safe : @entity46 , age 5 , is safe after he was taken hostage last tuesday by @entity22 and held in an underground bunker for several days dead : @entity22 , 65 , the hostage - taker , died in the @entity12 raid on his bunker on the first call to the scene on tuesday afternoon the local officers called upon assistance from neighbouring @entity86			1
an alarm went out to all local emergency services locally and , as one fire officer speaking to @entity90 , said ‘ it was like everything was lit up			0
then the @entity12 got involved and “ boom ” everything went quiet			2
’ for the first four hours on that first day a local police lieutenant spoke with @entity22			1
he lay on the grass and spoke down the pvc pipe that emerged from the ground as the only sign of the bunker beneath			0
as the situation dragged on , that pipe became the only means of passing supplies of medicine , toys and treats to the little boy below			0
local officers remained the ones who made the perilous trip through @entity22 ’s compound to deliver @entity46 ’s medicine – he suffers from adhd and mild autism – as , according to one @entity86 source , ‘ they figured that they ’d managed to walk the path there before without getting blown up so they might as well keep doing it			1
’ in truth , it seems unlikely that the @entity12 ’s reasoning was quite that casual			2
but they did fear that @entity22 ’s had rigged the bunker and the land surrounding it with explosives			2
as well as knowing that @entity22 had a gun , neighbours told officers that they believed he had pipe bombs			2
on the second day sniffer dogs were brought in trained in detecting explosives			0
the land was x-rayed and a decision made not to lower any sort of wire , or camera into the bunker as a result			0
among the first request made by @entity22 was that a reporter be brought in to tell his story			1
@entity90 has learned that his repeated and particular request was for ‘ four minutes on all the major tv networks ’ to tell what @entity149 described as ‘ a complex story			0
’ the side track leading to the small neighbourhood in which @entity22 lived and in which he dug out his final resting place , was closed off to all but residents who were checked in and out by guards			2
guarded : this is a glimpse of the property where @entity22 was holed up in an underground bunker he had dug himself eyes in the sky : helicopters circled the sky around the bunker as the @entity12 closed in on monday on saturday there was a marked increase of agency presence			1
two tactical vehicles arrived on the scene and parked in the dust across the road from the assembled press			0
the silver trailers bore the @entity12 emblem and initials			2
a large black mobile @entity178 was slowly driven up to the edge of the large barn at the crest of the hill behind which the bunker lay			0
heavily armed @entity184 were seen moving up on either side of that barn – tracking round the back and out of view			2
the impression as each day passed was of a man well and truly surrounded and , though @entity22 had access to television and @entity192 in his subterranean bunker , completely in the dark			1
as negotiators changed shifts , their handovers visible between 3 and 4pm each day , no significant news emerged other than the fact of their ongoing negotiations			0
far and wide : federal agents traveled to @entity9 from across the country , and @entity9 police came in from across the state working together : law enforcement officials from the @entity12 , the @entity207 and the @entity208 all collaborated on the standoff on friday evening a plane landed on the outskirts of the local airport and was met on the tarmac by a fleet of @entity215			1
by saturday morning those vans were parked up the sidetrack next to the barn			0
bit by bit as the net closed – as firepower descended and electronic surveillance watched – the official message , which was delivered with the knowledge that @entity22 was watching , was that authorities were grateful to him for caring for @entity46			1
but the moment they felt he no longer was , they were ready			0
for the first time in a long time @entity22 , disturbed and paranoid , may have believed he was in charge			2
but at 3.12 on monday afternoon that final delusion proved his undoing			0
special agent @entity235 continue to clear the scene and only after their work is done will evidence @entity239 move into process the scene .			0

@entity12 brought in its elite @entity184 and sophisticated equipment
secretary of defense @entity54 personally approved the use of military surveillance and personnel to help the @entity12 with surveillance
*suspect* @entity22 had *constant* access to tv and the internet
police and federal agents operated under veil of secrecy
@entity22 was killed and his hostage @entity46 , 5 , was feed during @entity12 raid
