the moon has been orbiting @entity1 for more than four billion years			1
but our planet ’s faithful companion may not be alone			0
a new object , dubbed 2014 @entity6 , has been found masquerading as @entity1 ’s ‘ second moon ’			1
the new ‘ moon ’ , which is in fact a 490ft ( 150 metre ) asteroid , takes about a year to orbit the sun and is close enough to @entity1 to look like its satellite			1
scroll down for animation a new object , dubbed 2014 @entity6 , has been found masquerading as @entity1 ’s ‘ second moon ’			1
the new ‘ moon ’ , which is in fact a 490ft ( 150 metre ) asteroid , takes about a year to orbit the sun and is close enough to @entity1 to look like its satellite			1
pictured is its elliptical orbit the peculiar object was accidentally discovered on july 29 by astronomer @entity25 of the @entity26 of @entity27			1
according to @entity28 writing in @entity29 , 2014 @entity6 has been travelling near to our planet for about 775 years and it will continue to do so for another 165 years			2
it has an elliptical orbit and takes around 364.92 days to circle the sun once , meaning the asteroid and @entity1 are in ‘ resonant orbits ’			1
this happens when two orbiting bodies exert a gravitational influence on each other due to their orbits being closely related			0
for instance , @entity42 and @entity43 are in an orbital resonance of 2:3			0
this means for every two times @entity42 goes around the sun , @entity43 makes three trips around the star			0
asteroid 2014 @entity6 orbits the sun in a similar timeframe to @entity1 , but our planet ’s gravity pushes it into an eccentric wobble			1
@entity57 has plans to capture an asteroid and bring it closer to @entity1 for astronauts to study			2
and in a series of new papers , which can be found here , the agency has revealed just how - and why - it might be done			0
@entity57 ’s ultimate goal is to send humans to @entity67 , and they say the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there			0
a number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission , which will involve redirecting an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it			2
@entity57 plans to launch an @entity69 robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with , capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade			0
the spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a ' @entity90 ' - one that orbits the moon very widely , coming quite close before extending out much further away			0
astronauts aboard @entity57 's @entity94 spacecraft , launched from the upcoming @entity95 ( @entity95 ) rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the mid- 2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon			2
looking up with powerful telescopes from @entity1 , @entity6 appears as though it is in orbit around our planet , moving backwards relative to the stars			1
a number of other space rocks have fallen into orbits that make them look as though they are circling the @entity1			0
like 2014 @entity6 , many of these take around one year to orbit the sun in elliptical orbits , according to @entity118 writing in the @entity120 blog			1
the most famous is @entity121 , a three - mile ( 5km ) asteroid that was discovered in 1986			0
however , it was n’t until 1997 that scientists uncovered its unusual path			0
our planet has also had a number of ‘ minimoons ’ , which are small asteroids that are affected by @entity1 's gravitational pull and orbit the planet , but for a much shorter timeframe			1
these minimoon are often only a few feet across , and each tends to do a stint of around a year in orbit - before resuming their previous lives as asteroids			0
scientists hope to one day ' catch ' a quasi-satellite which could offer a valuable sample of material largely unchanged since the dawn of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago			1
in 2012 , a team led by @entity147 at @entity148 calculated the probability that at any given time @entity1 has more than one moon			2
they used a supercomputer to simulate the passage of 10 million asteroids past @entity1			0
they concluded at anyone one time , there should be at least one asteroid with a diameter of at least one meter orbiting @entity1			2

the ' moon ’ is in fact a 490ft asteroid that takes a year to orbit the sun
it was discovered accidentally earlier this year astronomers in @entity189
asteroid is in ' resonant orbit ' with @entity1 and travels in an elliptical path
from @entity1 , @entity6 appears as though it is in orbit around our planet
scientists hope to sample material from one of these ' *semi-satellites* '
material could offer clues about how planets and solar systems form
