a judge described a teenage rape victim as ‘ extremely foolish ’ and ‘ unwise ’ for getting very drunk as he jailed the two men who attacked her			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , both 21 , raped the 18 - year - old student in an alley after leading her from a nearby nightclub in an ‘ inebriated ’ condition			1
earlier the young woman had been seen ‘ stumbling ’ around and ‘ throwing herself ’ at men inside the club , @entity14 was told			1
jailed : @entity4 , left , and @entity5 , right , both 21 , are beginning nine - year jail sentences for ' a rape of the most squalid kind ' after they attacked a woman they had just met on the dancefloor of a nightclub after her 50 - minute ordeal the victim was dishevelled , distressed and covered in blood , with cuts and bruises to her back			1
jailing both men for nine years , mr @entity28 said that the victim was ‘ extremely foolish , ’ commenting : ‘ she became so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation			1
’ but he also told the defendants : ‘ there should be no doubt what you did was still rape , and rape of the most squalid kind			1
‘ your victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated			2
but it was you , and only you , who deliberately took advantage of her condition ... to see what fun you could have with her			0
' it 's just lasses attention - seeking ' : what @entity4 , pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing , said of the victim after he was arrested by police ‘ it was you who decided to treat her body as a plaything on which to act out your sordid fantasies of having a threesome			1
’ the case comes at a time of huge controversy over the rape laws and the issue – which featured in the conviction of footballer @entity66 – of a victim being too drunk to consent			1
the court heard the woman kissed @entity71 and @entity4 , and @entity72 showed them ‘ leading her outside ’ within 15 minutes of meeting her at @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			2
@entity79 , prosecuting , told the jury the men saw her as ‘ an easy target ’ and ignored her pleas that she wanted to go back to her friends as they went outside			2
the pair bragged to a taxi driver about the ‘ threesome ’ as they left the scene last august and exchanged jokey texts about what they had done			0
one described the incident as ‘ funny as * * * * ’			0
abattoir worker @entity4 admitted downing more than a dozen pints of lager as well as a vodka and cola			2
@entity5 told police that he had had seven pints			1
the victim was later found to have blood alcohol levels that were double the legal driving limit			0
the jury convicted each man of a charge of rape , and @entity4 of a count of sexual assault			1
they were cleared of another rape offence			0
when @entity4 was arrested , he admitted having sex , but claimed it was consensual , and said : ‘ it ’s just lasses attention - seeking			2
’ @entity5 , a former sales worker who had been due to study law at university , later admitted having intercourse			1
he initially told police : ‘ i saw what went on , but i had no part in it			0
’ after the case @entity124 from @entity125 said the judge ’s comments about the victim being extremely foolish were ‘ unhelpful ’			1
but she added : ‘ the judge makes it clear that 100 per cent of responsibility for this crime is down to these two men			2
’ inebriated : @entity4 and @entity71 had been drinking for most of the day before going to @entity76 , pictured , a popular dance venue in @entity77 , @entity78 , where they met their victim @entity137 , of @entity138 which supports victims of sexual and domestic violence , said : ‘ the only person responsible for rape is the rapist			1
’ this week research by the @entity144 showed that more than a quarter of the public believe victims of rape or sex attacks are at least ‘ a little bit responsible ’ if they were drunk			2
among 16 to 19 - year - olds the proportion rises to one in three			0
last month the head of the @entity153 , @entity154 , said society must ‘ challenge ’ the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been ‘ drinking			0
’ the number of recorded sexual offences is at a 10 - year high , official figures show			0
in the year to march 2014 there were a total of 64,205 sex crime incidents across @entity167 and @entity168 , an increase of a fifth on the previous year			0
within that , the number of rapes increased 26 per cent to 20,745 incidents , while the number of other sexual offences increased 17 per cent fo 43,460 incidents			0
the @entity144 said the increases may in part be because victims are more willing to come forward after the high - profile prosecutions of public figures such as @entity181 and @entity182			0
' while some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the historical crimes reported as part of @entity189 , there is evidence to suggest that there has been a wider " @entity193 effect " , ' the @entity144 said in a statement			0
' this refers to an increased willingness on the part of victims of sexual offences that are not directly connected to @entity199 to come forward to report both historical and recent sexual offences			0

@entity4 and @entity5 used their victim ' as a plaything '
judge called victim ' foolish ' and ' unwise ' for getting extremely drunk
but told *guilty* men : ' it was you and only you who took advantage of her '
comments come amid debate over rape law following @entity66 case
women 's campaign *group* said that judge 's comments were ' unhelpful '
