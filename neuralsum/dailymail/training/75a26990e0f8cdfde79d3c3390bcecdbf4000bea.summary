by @entity0 published : 20:29 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 19 june 2013 during the doldrums of the football year , the @entity2 cheer squad has taken upon itself to spread joy and goodwill among football fans , with a video of themselves miming a cheesy pop song			1
the video comes after last year 's ' cover ' of @entity12 's ' @entity13 ' , during which the bikini - clad cheer squad mimed along to the song wearing , well , not much really			1
this year 's effort is more of the same , with the young women writhing around a beach in the @entity20 and miming the lyrics to @entity22 's ' 22 '			2
the video , like last year 's , was shot in the tropical locale during the cheerleaders ' photo - shoot for their annual calendar			2
passionate : the girls meant every word they mimed , most especially this one , who appears ' happy , free , confused and lonely at the same time ' in the swim : just a couple of @entity2 cheerleaders singing by the pool the girls have competition though - turns out this cheerleaders - miming - to - pop - songs - in - bikinis game is a cut - throat business			0
the @entity50 cheer squad has taken the miming and bikini concept and expanded it to include hamburger - eating , boxing and albino alligator - holding in the lush and swampy surrounds of @entity56			0
@entity58 babe : the @entity60 cheerleaders had some fun with their video later gator : this cheerful lass appears unperturbed by the dangerous prehistoric reptile she 's cradling in her arms the fun - loving cheerleaders also included funny glasses , dancing on a hoverboat and holding crabs in their video cover of @entity22 's song			1
in the inaugural battle for video - miming supremacy , @entity75 's @entity74 has pronounced the @entity50 cheerleaders the definitive winners for creativity , camera shots and organization			0
it remains to be seen whether other cheer squads will pick up the gauntlet thrown down by the plucky @entity2 and @entity50 cheer ladies this year			0
it 's also unclear whether or not the cheerleaders had convened to decide on this year 's cover or if both teams just have impeccable taste in music			1
stay tuned for more songs by other people being inexplicably mimed by attractive cheerleaders in the future .			0
