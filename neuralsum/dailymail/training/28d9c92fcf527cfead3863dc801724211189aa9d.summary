what started with a cheap shot four years ago will finally reach a deafening crescendo on saturday night as @entity3 defends his @entity5 light heavyweight title against @entity6			1
the warring pair will settle their differences in the @entity10 after months of verbal insults			1
and having come to blows last august in a disgraceful brawl , @entity3 and @entity6 clashed again on @entity14 as hotel security stepped in to calm yet another heated exchange			1
at friday 's weigh - in , meanwhile , @entity6 turned his back on @entity3 as they pair refused to face - off			1
they then traded final verbal insults at the fighters ' meeting			2
@entity6 , meanwhile , believes he has exposed @entity3 as two - faced ahead of their mouthwatering match - up			1
' i respect him as a champion but i do n't necessarily respect that he wears many faces , ' he told @entity47			2
' i think we need to see the real @entity3 and we 're starting to see that			1
' when he 's in public or on tv , he portrays a person he 's not really all the time			2
sometimes he can be rude to fans and with some of the things he 's said to me off camera			2
' when you wear that many hats , it starts to get confusing			2
' his emotions towards me are real			2
if you 're indifferent towards someone , it does n't matter			2
if you feel like you 're superior to that person , it does n't matter			2
but when you have genuine dislike for someone it 's hard to hide your emotions			2
because he has real - life animosity towards me , his real feelings are starting to come through			1
' the rivalry has been brewing since 2010 when @entity3 approached @entity6 backstage at @entity76 as @entity77 took on @entity78			1
@entity6 ( right ) kicks @entity79 in their @entity5 heavyweight bout at the @entity81 world champion @entity3 ( left ) demonstrates his kicking skills against @entity26 during @entity5 @entity3 ( left ) and @entity6 also faced off during a press conference at the @entity85 last august ' i reached out to him and told him i 'd beat him in a wrestling match , sarcastically , ' @entity3 explained to @entity47			1
' he got all bothered about it and when i walked away i felt very awkward ; i felt like it told a joke that did n't go down very well			2
' i thought it was over but a week later , on @entity93 , him and another wrestler tagged me in a conversation in which they were both insulting me , saying that i sucked at wrestling			2
' i realised the guys were serious and that not only did my joke not go down well but it became a reason for @entity6 to have beef with me			1
i read the tweets and that 's when i realised i did n't like him			0
a grown man could n't take me being sarcastic and he twisted it up in his mind to have a reason to dislike me			0
' @entity6 added : ' hes easily the person i 've felt the most animosity for , just because it 's been festering for so long			1
' it 's been a number of things over the course of time @entity3 and i have interacted			1
it 's not one situation that 's made him have the feelings he has or me the feelings i have			0
it 's a number of things that we 've experienced that 's made us get to this point			0
' i did n't see him as a rival at the time			0
i knew who he was and i was a fan of him			0
i 'd been watching him come up the @entity5 ranks			1
i did n't see him as a potential opponent until we started to interact with each other and i thought ok , at some point we 're going to fight			1
' is that going to affect how i compete inside the @entity135 ? not by any means			0
i 'm going to fight like a professional and in the way i need to fight			1
but in terms of outside the @entity135 , i 've never had an opponent who has gotten to me that way @entity3 has			1
' @entity3 pumps up the crowd during an open workout at the @entity85 on wednesday @entity6 ( right ) shows off his ground skills by attempting to submit @entity145 in @entity146 and while @entity3 acknowledges @entity6 's achievements to date , he believes he is dreaming if he thinks he can become a @entity5 champion			1
' he 's a dreamer , ' he said			0
' he has high hopes and goals but he has n't been able to achieve these things			0
he had a dream to be a national champion but he lost in the final			0
he had a dream to be an @entity158 champion and it did n't happen			0
now he has the opportunity to be a @entity5 champion and i do n't believe it 's going to happen			1
he 's a dreamer because he does n't have the heart to pull it off			0
' he talks so much because he 's trying to make people and himself believe in him			0
he speaks a good game but when push comes to shove i do n't think he has what it takes to be champion like me			1
' @entity3 has reigned as champion since 2011 and has made seven successful defences but @entity6 is convinced he is the man to end that run			1
' i match up well against him , ' he said			0
' there 's no secret formula to beating him , i just feel style for style i match up pretty well against him			0
' i think people will be surprised			0
anytime a guy is as dominant as @entity3 has been , we tend to hold him in such high regard that we think he 's unbeatable			1
but no - one is unbeatable			2
@entity6 ( top ) wrestles with @entity183 as he prepares for his shot at the light heavyweight title @entity6 raises his hands after taking @entity183 during an open workout on wednesday ' if @entity3 , after being as dominant as he 's been , gets beat , people will think , " wow , where has this guy come from ? " , because regardless of how good you are , they do n't expect you to be as good as him and be on the level he 's dominated for so long			1
' a poll among a handful of @entity5 fighters earlier this week backed @entity6 to shock the champion but @entity3 insists too much has been made of the challenger 's wrestling ability			1
' it 's not a wrestling match , ' he added			0
' he is a great wrestler but he was magnificent back in 2004 and 2008 when he wrestled in the @entity158			0
it 's been several years since he was at his wrestling peak and i 'm going to show that			0
i 'm going to show i can wrestle him			0
' yes he might be a little bit better of a wrestler than me at a wrestling tournament but it 's not a wrestling tournament ,			0
people are punching you and elbowing you and keeping you guessing			0
' i 've fought many wrestlers and i 've been able to mesmerise them and not allow them to do what they thought they were going to do			0
i believe i 'll do the same with @entity6			1
' he has a lot of confidence and it seems so simple when you 're coming up with a plan but when you 're in there it 's difference			0
my strategy changes mid fight and i 'll do something he did n't prepare for and pick him apart			2
' i 'm proven against guys like him and i believe he 'll be another victim			0
