@entity201 , defending , said the attempted murder offences were ‘ out of character ’ and occurred due to @entity1 ’s lack of maturity and his desire to show off to friends			0

detective chief inspector @entity218 , from @entity219 , said : ‘ this incident started after a minor disagreement between the two groups of men			0
the @entity16 footage demonstrates that @entity1 thought he would finish the argument by purposefully using a car as a weapon and deliberately driving into @entity31 and his friends			1
‘ the @entity16 footage gives an example of how fast he was driving the car and the impact it had with mr @entity31			1

‘ thanks to the information we received , we were able to arrest @entity1 and bring him to justice			0
