by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 06:37 est , 27 july 2013 expecting : @entity1 and his girlfriend @entity2 are to have a baby she has n’t got a @entity5 profile and she keeps her @entity7 page private			1
given that she has spent the last three years as a medical student , 23 - year - old @entity2 probably has little time for such inconsequential social networking – or simply values her own space			1
all that , however , looks destined to change after she fell into the plastic celebrity world of @entity1 – a man 17 years her senior – and became pregnant with his child			2
while @entity1 ’s fans have been quick to congratulate the pair , the @entity16 understands miss @entity2 ’s family have been ‘ left cold ’ by the thought that @entity1 – who has two children with former wife @entity22 – will now be a permanent fixture in the life of their only daughter			1
a friend of the 40 - year - old singer said although miss @entity2 ’s family like him they think he has ‘ a lot of baggage ’ and their daughter faces having her life turned into a tacky circus with every aspect laid bare for public consumption			1
a true king of downmarket reality tv , @entity1 provides constant updates about his life to almost 3million followers on @entity5 , and earlier this month launched the @entity45 online telling fans they can now watch him 24 hours a day			0
miss @entity2 , meanwhile , has mainly enjoyed an idyllic and quiet upbringing as a ‘ solid , middle - class girl ’ in a family home in @entity50			1
ironically @entity1 and miss @entity2 would never have met were it not for her surgeon father @entity52 , 55			1
he was the star ’s consultant during surgery for kidney stones in 2010 and , knowing she was a fan of his music , introduced her to him			0
the pair developed a friendship but did not begin dating until summer 2012			0
miss @entity2 has now deferred the final year of her medical course in order to concentrate on impending motherhood			1
new family : miss @entity2 pictured with @entity1 's daughter princess @entity63 the source said : ‘ her family thought it would just be a nice romance and that she would finish university and that as she matured it would run its course			1
they like @entity70 but this was not the path they had planned for their daughter – deferring university to have a baby with a man almost twice her age			0
‘ @entity70 sees @entity2 as a sweet girl and chose her because she has no interest in being famous and wo n’t emasculate him like his former wife			2
' @entity2 was n’t interested in his celebrity at all			2
but that could be the undoing of their relationship because in order to be with @entity1 you need to love the vapid and superficial celebrity world that he occupies			0
’ studies : miss @entity2 is pictured on her graduation day @entity1 has seldom been out of the limelight since being offered a role on talent show @entity92 as a teenager			1
a string of hit singles followed and in 2004 his status as a reality tv star was sealed when he entered hit @entity100 show i ’m a celebrity , @entity95 ! it was in the @entity104 jungle that he met @entity22 , real name @entity22			0
the pair embarked on a much - publicised relationship , marrying and having two children : princess @entity63 , six , and @entity109 , eight			0
their relationship played out for their fans on their reality tv programme and when they separated in 2009 @entity1 was given his own show			0
the eldest of five siblings , @entity118 and her brothers grew up in a property worth more than £ 1million in @entity121			0
friends now fear the student could be heading for a collision with @entity1 ’s formidable manager @entity125 , who helps secure his tv and magazine deals			0
the friend said : ‘ @entity2 ’s parents are not big fans of the world @entity70 lives in			2
’ another source however said @entity1 ’s family was not so different from @entity118 ’s			2
the source said : ‘ @entity1 ’s dad is an architect and his parents have been married for around 60 years with five children			0
‘ despite the pop star career , @entity1 has a lot in common with @entity2 and that is why they get on so well			1
‘ he has built up a great business outside of showbiz , and owns three properties around the world			0
’ a spokesman for @entity1 denied miss @entity2 ’s family were disappointed that she was with the star and said he and miss @entity2 ’s father had just spent two weeks on holiday together and they are good friends .			1
