it was the ' @entity2 ' @entity1 aircraft shot from the skies while delivering tanks and weaponry to the battlefield during the @entity7			1
now nearly 70 years after being shot down by a @entity10 fighter , experts have found the only surviving example of the @entity13 ' transport plane , 200ft underwater off the coast of @entity16			1
the @entity17 - the largest land - based transport aircraft from the @entity7 - was on its way to the @entity22 city of @entity23 from its @entity1 base in @entity16 when it was hit by a @entity27 fighter plane in july 1943			1
wreckage : the rusting wreck of the @entity13 was found by a small team of @entity31 divers off the @entity33 coast submerged : the 45 - tonne transport plane - found 69 years after it was shot down - was thought to be the biggest of its kind in the @entity7 discovery : divers had been looking for the wreckage of another plane when they found the @entity42 , a find described as being ' of great historical importance ' after being taken down by the long - range fighter plane , it plunged into waters off the @entity49 islands , an idyllic getaway island now popular with holidaymakers			1
but a small team of divers and amateur historians have since ' stumbled upon ' the wreckage hundreds of feet underwater , claiming the rusting @entity42 is amazingly still intact			2
capacity : 130 troops / 10 - 12 tonnes of equipment length : 28.2m ( 92ft 4in ) @entity61 : 55.2m ( 181ft ) height : 10.15m ( 33ft 4in ) maximum speed : 285km/h ( 177mph ) cruise speed : 218km/h ( 136mph ) climbing rate : 3.6m/s ( 710ft/min ) remarkably , divers found the wreckage while they were searching for another sunken plane			2
@entity69 , a diving instructor and photographer who took pictures of the wreck , told @entity75 : ' it was just by chance that we found it because we were actually looking for a different plane wreck			0
' we had understood that the @entity17 was in a totally different location so we were lucky to stumble on it			0
' it is in good condition â€“ it is almost intact , with the six engines still all in line			0
' other experts described the find as one of ' great historical importance '			1
@entity7 historians say they are aware of ' no other complete surviving @entity2 in existence			0
' there were an estimated 213 @entity93 made , with the transport plane 's first flight in 1942 , before it was retired in 1944			0
it could take a load of up to 12 tonnes , or 120 fully - equipped men , and could reach speeds of around 210km/h ( 130mph ) , though variants like the @entity100 could reach up to 285km/h ( 177mph )			0
only around 200 of the giant planes were ever produced , with the @entity42 's seeing action between 1942 and 1944			0
the @entity42 came into use due to the @entity1 ' demand for airlifting vehicles and weaponry overseas as part of the @entity110 ' plan to invade @entity111			0
massive : the @entity42 could carry up to 25,000lbs , or 120 fully - equipped men , and regularly carried tanks and weaponry to the battlefield the @entity42 recently found had been travelling from its @entity1 base in @entity16 to @entity23 in @entity22 when it was shot down over the @entity49 in 1943 @entity119 was loaded on to the enormous planes through double doors that formed the curved nose of the plane			1
the wartime discovery is the second in the space of three months , after divers found the wreckage of an @entity31 navy battleship , also off the @entity33 coast			1
experts found the @entity132 69 years after it was sunk by the @entity1 , in an incident which claimed 1,400 lives .			2
