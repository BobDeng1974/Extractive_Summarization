by @entity1 reporter published : 13:21 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 13:28 est , 30 september 2013 woman in charge : @entity4 started off her food industry career as a waitress at @entity7 to pay for college , but soon rose through the ranks and is now the president of @entity11 @entity4 , the 35 - year - old president of @entity11 , had an unlikely rise to corporate power			1
for 15 years @entity14 worked at @entity7 , starting off as a waitress and working her way up to becoming vice president			1
at first , the job was just to help pay for college , since she had to pay for her education herself			2
@entity14 had a humble beginning , growing up under a single mother who fed her family for $ 10 a week , mostly with canned food and frozen lasagna			2
so @entity14 took as job as a waitress at the sports bar chain 's @entity30 location			2
but the more she worked at @entity7 , the more it took her away from school at the @entity36 and her dream of becoming an engineer			0
soon she was filling in for managers , and eventually the company asked the then 19 - year - old @entity14 to help open a store in @entity43			2
after that , the company continued to ask her to help with other openings , first in @entity47 then @entity50 and two @entity49 states			0
' i came back to school and was failing because i had n't been there , ' she told @entity54			0
gut - buster : the @entity56 has 880 calories , 36 grams of fat and 59 grams of sugar			0
but despite complaints from nutritionists , @entity14 is determined to keep the recipe and size the same quick rise : @entity14 was hired by @entity63 in 2010 to be the chief operating officer of @entity11			1
two months after getting her mba , they promoted her to president @entity14 then transition from opening to stores to training employees at @entity7 headquarters in @entity74			1
by the time she was 26 , @entity14 had become a vice president all without a college degree			1
but a determined @entity14 changed that by enrolling in @entity80 's executive mba program			2
in 2010 , @entity14 left the company when she was hired by @entity63 to be the new chief operating officer of @entity11			1
moving up : before helping to open the @entity7 location in @entity43 , @entity14 had n't left the country let alone her home state			1
now she 's a certified world traveler , pictured above in @entity89 , @entity91 's @entity90 money maker : @entity93 is expected to reach $ 1billion in retail sales this year			1
above , @entity14 with her niece , left , and in @entity96 , right two months after she finished her mba , the company promoted her to president of @entity11			1
while some have questioned @entity14 's quick rise to power , she points out that she 's only ever had one male boss			1
since coming to @entity93 , @entity14 has helped the bakery chain expand outside of the mall food court through licensing deals			1
this year @entity11 retail sales will hit $ 1billion and that 's due in large part to her marketing strategy			1
now you can get versions of the @entity11 at @entity114 and @entity115			0
you can eat @entity11 cookies and taste the @entity11 flavoring in your morning bowl of @entity119			0
soon you 'll be able to buy @entity93 - flavored @entity121 k - cups for your @entity122 and add @entity123			0
cinnabon your life : @entity14 has helped expand @entity11 's business through licensing deals with other companies to use the @entity11 flavor ' the brand punches way above its weight , ' said @entity14			1
but @entity14 has also come to power at a time when there is increased pressure on food producers to help change @entity49 eating habits			2
the @entity11 is an infamously indulgent dessert and the classic roll comes in at a whopping 880 calories with 36 grams of fat and 56 grams of sugar			0
that 's the equivalent of eating two @entity143			0
' it 's almost pronographic , ' she says			0
' it 's just so over-the - top			0
' while @entity14 has considered changing the product to reflect a more health - conscious consumer , she decided in the end not to change a thing			0
market research also proved that while customers would n't eat the enormous @entity93 often , they wanted the option to have it when they wanted			0
that once - in - while indulgence had to be ' so worth it - which @entity93 is , ' @entity14 said			2
' it became obvious that it was not the route to go			0

@entity4 started her career in the food industry as a @entity7 waitress to pay for college
but she quickly rose through the ranks of the company and was a vice president by the age of 26
in 2010 , she left @entity7 to become chief operating officer of @entity11
within two months of getting her mba she was promoted to president
this year , @entity93 is expected to take in $ 1billion in sales , due in part to @entity14 's focus on licensing deals
