seeing any professional athlete up close and personal always makes you feel that bit more insignificant			1
but seeing 20 - odd @entity4 soccer players in the flesh makes you wonder if you are in fact a part of the same species			2
they are , quite simply , awesome - looking			2
@entity9 , the @entity10 star , is 32 but looks 10 years younger and more like a surfer dude than a defensive midfielder thanks to a fine head of dreadlocks			2
think @entity15 at @entity16 circa 1994			2
goalkeeper @entity17 has come a long way from his first club , @entity19 you were expecting @entity9 to finish each sentence with ‘ narly ’ but this is a player who can boast three appearances at last summer ’s @entity25 so he is to be respected			1
some of the younger members of @entity28 ’s experimental squad resembled @entity30 models just as much as strikers or defenders			2
but @entity17 , well , he definitely looks like a goalkeeper			1
the @entity39 native has come a long way from his first club , @entity19 , to reach the point where he is now first - choice with @entity42			1
not that he feels like a true no 1			1
‘ i do n’t know , i do n’t know if i ’ll ever feel like one , ’ the 30 - year - old said pitchside at @entity46			1
‘ being in the @entity48 , being with the national team , you are constantly trying to prove yourself			2
when you get complacent , that ’s when you lose the spring in your step			0
it ’s always about moving on			0
' for me , it ’s trying to prove week in week out that i am justifying the manager ’s selection			0
so for me , i do n’t necessarily look at myself as a no 1			1
i want to improve my own play and then justify the manager ’s selection			0
and you do that by playing well , making saves in any way you can			0
’ @entity63 refuses to take it for granted being no 1 for club and country he dislodged @entity67 at @entity68 and with his club - mate likely to feature in a much - changed @entity70 starting @entity71 , they will be on opposing sides			1
the competition for places has n’t soured the feeling between the two men			0
‘ you ’re fighting for playing time but our relationship has been very good , both on and off the pitch , ’ @entity17 insisted			1
‘ for me , i ’ve been very fortunate to work with him for so long now , his resume speaks for itself , what he ’s done , not only at club level but at international level			0
‘ it speaks volumes for him as a professional			0
’ and @entity92 ( there was always going to be a question about @entity92 ) , what ’s it like working with him ? ‘ obviously he ’s a passionate guy who wants to win so for the past couple of months now , working with him at @entity42 , he brings that intensity , brings that passion to training and into matches and that ’s what you want within a training ground			1
’ goalkeeper @entity17 and @entity104 head coach @entity28 , left , speak to the media @entity17 has certainly impressed his assistant manager at club level , so much so that @entity108 described the @entity4 as a ‘ real man ’ and one of the few ‘ personalties ’ left in the game			1
‘ yeah ! i mean , listen , football is a man ’s game , you have to be able to take the good with the bad and the bad with the good , ’ he continued			1
‘ i ’ve always said i ’m very fortunate to be in the position i ’m at , coming from @entity4 , starting in @entity119 and now being able to play in the @entity48 , week in and week out			0
‘ i ’m very lucky and you do n’t take any of that for granted			0
today is an another example of that , being able to represent your country is an honour			0
‘ so it ’s always nice when you hear kind words but at the same time you ’re always looking to get better and improve , and to help your team			0
’ spoken like a true pro.			0

@entity17 unsure whether he *'ll* ever feel like a no 1
the goalkeeper has been in *sterling* form for @entity42
@entity17 says he has a good relationship with @entity67
