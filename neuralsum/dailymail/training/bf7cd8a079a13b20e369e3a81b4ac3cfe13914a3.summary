between 200 - 300 earthquakes occur in the @entity38 every year though the vast majority are too slight to notice @entity38 earthquakes , particularly in @entity55 , are most often attributed to glacial rebound			1
until about 10 , 500 years ago much of the north of the @entity38 was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle			1
these rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted , causing occasional earthquakes in the process			0
the @entity38 is also subject to tectonic stresses caused by the expansion of the @entity68 , which is slowly pushing the entire of @entity70 to the east , and from the northward motion of @entity73 , which is pushing into @entity74 from the south .			2
