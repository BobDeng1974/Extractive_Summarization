by @entity0 worrying new study : @entity2 , director of the @entity3 and @entity4 at the @entity5 in @entity6 rates of autism in the @entity9 rocketed by nearly 30 percent between 2008 and 2010 and have more than doubled since the beginning of the century , according to a worrying new study from the @entity5			1
the condition now affects 1 in 68 @entity9 children - which in effect means that every grade in every elementary school in the country has an autistic child - which is an astonishing rise in numbers for a condition that was unheard of 25 - years ago			1
the study does not explain why the numbers have so dramatically risen , but much of the increase is believed to be from a cultural and medical shift , with doctors diagnosing autism more frequently , especially in children with milder cases of the condition			1
' we do n't know the extent those factors explain in terms of the increase , but we clearly know they do play a role , ' said @entity2 , director of the @entity35 at the @entity5 to @entity36			2
' our system tells us what 's going on			0
it only gives us clues as to the why			0
' experts have also made a link between parents who have children later on in life			1
however , @entity46 , the chief science officer for @entity47 said that he believes the problem needs to be confronted and that something in the environment may be causing the problem			0
the latest report by the @entity9 @entity5 , which looks at data from 2010 , estimates that 14.7 per 1,000 8 - year - olds in 11 @entity9 communities have autism			1
that compares with the prior estimate of 1 in 88 children , or 11.3 of 1,000 8 - year - olds , in 2008 , and 1 in 150 children in 2000 other experts told @entity36 that they were not surprised at all by the increase and said that numbers were only set to rise			2
they pointed out that in @entity66 , autism rates were 50 percent higher than the rest of the nation in 2000 and were still much higher in 2010			1
this suggests that national rates will only catch up to those in @entity66			2
' we ca n't dismiss the numbers			0
but we ca n't interpret it to mean more people are getting the disorder , ' said @entity77 , a psychologist at the @entity79 - @entity78 and the @entity80 in suburban @entity81 , @entity82 the @entity5 released the latest estimate thursday			1
the @entity6 - based agency said its calculation means autism affects roughly 1.2 million @entity9 under 21			1
two years ago , the @entity5 put the estimate at 1 in 88 children , or about 1 million			1
the cause or causes of autism are still not known			0
without any blood test or other medical tests for autism , diagnosis is not an exact science			0
it 's identified by making judgments about a child 's behavior			0
autism encompasses a spectrum of disorders , ranging from a profound inability to communicate and mental retardation to relatively mild symptoms in people with very high intellectual ability a child diagnosed on the autism spectrium must show deficits in three distinct areas : communications , social skills and typical behavior			0
roughly one - third of children in the @entity5 study also showed intellectual problems , but the other two - thirds showed above - average intelligence			1
thursday 's report is considered the most comprehensive on the frequency of autism			2
researchers gathered data in 2010 from areas in 11 states — @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity66 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			0
the report focused on 8 - year - olds because most autism is diagnosed by that age			0
the researchers checked health and school records to see which children met the criteria for autism , even if they had n't been formally diagnosed			1
then , the researchers calculated how common autism was in each place and overall			2
the @entity5 started using this method in 2007 when it came up with an estimate of 1 in 150 children			1
two years later , it went to 1 in 110			0
in 2012 , it went to 1 in 88			0
last year , the @entity5 released results of a less reliable calculation — from a survey of parents — which suggested as many as 1 in 50 children have autism			1
experts are n't surprised by the growing numbers , and some say all it reflects is that doctors , teachers and parents are increasingly likely to say a child with learning and behavior problems is autistic			2
some @entity5 experts say screening and diagnosis are clearly major drivers , but that they ca n't rule out some actual increase as well			1
' we can not say what portion is from better diagnosis and improved understanding versus if there 's a real change , ' said @entity2 , the @entity5 official overseeing research into children 's developmental disabilities			1
for decades , autism meant kids with severe language , intellectual and social impairments and unusual , repetitious behaviors			0
but the definition has gradually expanded and now includes milder , related conditions			0
the study showed significantly different autism rates by region , ranging from 1 in 175 children in @entity128 to 1 in 45 children in @entity66 , which could reflect access to healthcare and other factors one sign of that : in the latest study , almost half of autistic kids had average or above average iqs			1
that 's up from a third a decade ago and can be taken as an indication that the autism label is more commonly given to higher - functioning children , @entity5 officials acknowledged			1
aside from that , much in the latest @entity5 report echoes earlier findings			2
autism and related disorders continue to be diagnosed far more often in boys than girls , and in whites than blacks or @entity217			0
the racial and ethnic differences probably reflects white communities ' greater focus on looking for autism and white parents ' access to doctors , because there 's no biological reason to believe whites get autism more than other people , @entity5 officials said at a press briefing thursday			1
one change @entity5 officials had hoped to see , but did n't , was a drop in the age of diagnosis			2
experts say a diagnosis can now be made at age 2 or even earlier			0
but the new report said the majority of children continue to be diagnosed after they turn 4			0
' we know the earlier a child is identified and connected with services , the better , ' @entity2 said			0
the @entity248 issued a statement thursday , saying the nation needs to step up screening for the condition and research into autism 's causes			2
' it 's critical that we as a society do not become numb to these numbers , ' said dr. @entity259 , head of the group 's autism subcommittee .			0

as many as one in 68 @entity9 children may have autism , @entity9 health officials said on thursday
researchers at the @entity5 did not study why the rates were so much higher
some experts believe the higher rates reflect a heightened focus on autism by parents
