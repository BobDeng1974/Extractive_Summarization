@entity0 was left red - faced over @entity1 when its @entity3 service was infiltrated by hackers , and now its facing a similar problem			1
reports on a @entity8 website claim that a list of 1,800 @entity0 - owned @entity11 's usernames and passwords have been published online			1
with access to these details , a security expert warns that criminals could break into accounts , change settings and buy virtual items			1
the hack was reported by @entity21 , and many of the verified accounts ( selection pictured ) are believed to belong to @entity8 gamers			1
it is not known how the hackers got their hands on the credentials , but security analyst @entity30 wrote : ' possibilities range from phishing attacks , malware , or even a security breach ' the hack was reported by @entity21 , and many of the verified accounts are believed to belong to @entity8 gamers			1
it is not known how the hackers got their hands on the credentials , but security analyst @entity30 wrote on the @entity40 blog : ' possibilities range from simple phishing attacks , keylogging malware stealing players ’ details as they log into the game , or even a security breach at @entity11 itself			1
' let ’s hope it ’s not the last one - because the game has over 100 million registered users			2
' however , a @entity0 spokesman told @entity54 : ' we can confirm that no @entity57 service was compromised			1
' normal industry procedures for dealing with situations like this were put in place to reset passwords for the small number of affected accounts			1
' @entity11 was created in 2009			2
at the start of the game , a character is put into a ' virtually infinite game world			2
' they can then walk around different terrains , including mountains , forests and caves			2
players can also fly up in the air for a birds - eye view of the landscape			2
players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities			0

he added that when the company discovers lists gamertags , usernames and passwords posted online , it takes ' immediate action to protect customers by reviewing valid credentials and resetting account access when necessary			1
' based on the huge number of registered users , the hack is relatively small			2
but , as mr @entity30 pointed out : ' if unauthorised users exploited the exposed email addresses and passwords they could not only log into other people ’s gameworlds , but also download a full version of the game which normally sells for € 19.95 euros ( $ 26.95 or £ 17.95 )			0
' plus , once a cybercriminal has access to a person 's email address they could use it hack other accounts , send spam or spread malware			1
mr @entity30 additionally said there is no guarantee that the hacker who released this current list also does n't have more ' in their back pocket			0
' @entity0 bought @entity124 in september in a deal said to be worth $ 2.5 billion ( £ 1.5 billion )			1
the game is available on pcs , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , as well as games consoles including the @entity3 and @entity132			0
however , a @entity0 spokesman told @entity54 that no @entity57 service was compromised			1
although the number of released details is a small percentage of the game 's 100 million user base , mr @entity30 said there is no guarantee the hacker who released this current list does n't have more ' in their back pocket ' at the start of the game , a character is put into a ' virtually infinite game world			0
' they can then walk around different terrains , including mountains , forests and caves			0
players can also fly up in the air for a birds - eye view of the landscape			0
players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities			0
as a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials			0
more than 16,645,000 people have bought the game , so far , and it is an online phenomenon			0
