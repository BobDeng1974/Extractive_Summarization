a pill that blocks the action of a so - called ‘ love hormone ’ could be a new treatment for premature ejaculation			1
the medication – which was developed by @entity7 scientists - is being tested in a clinical trial starting this month			0
it treatment targets a hormone called oxytocin which is thought to encourage feelings of bonding , and is released in response to touch			1
studies show it also increases sexual arousal , and triggers ejaculation			1
the idea is that if oxytocin can be blocked , the moment of ejaculation can be delayed the new drug is a so - called oxytocin - antagonist , which means it stops oxytocin binding to cells in the body			1
the idea is that if oxytocin can be blocked , the moment of ejaculation can be delayed			1
it ’s estimated that nearly five million men in the @entity7 suffer from premature ejaculation			2
the condition means sexual intercourse only lasts a few minutes or even seconds , which can lead to low self - esteem , and relationship difficulties			0
for many men the condition is present throughout adulthood , but it can also be triggered by conditions such as diabetes , multiple sclerosis , high blood pressure , prostate disease and overactive or underactive thyroid gland			0
treatments include talking therapies , which are designed to help men develop better control of their ejaculatory reflexes , as well as medications such as anaesthetic creams that have a numbing effect			0
a type of antidepressant - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - have also been shown to work for some men as they are thought to reduce sexual arousal , although they may trigger side effects such as nausea , headache , insomnia , and dizziness			2
one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor has been designed specially to treat premature ejaculation			0
but the drug , called dapoxetine , is not suitable for men with heart , kidney and liver problems , and can carry side effects such as headaches and nausea			1
scientists behind the new treatment , which is manufactured by @entity78 , say their oxytocin - blocker may provide a viable alternative , and with fewer side effects			1
animal studies at the @entity84 - @entity83 in @entity85 , and published in the @entity86 , have shown that oxytocin blockers can delay premature ejaculation			2
now the drug is being trialled on 90 men aged 18 to 60			1
in the year - long trial , conducted at various centres in the @entity92 and @entity93 , the volunteers will take different doses of the drug one to seven hours before sexual intercourse			1
commenting on the trial , professor @entity97 , consultant urological surgeon at @entity98 said the drug may benefit patients , but cautioned it should be used alongside psychological therapies			0
premature ejaculation means sexual intercourse only lasts a few minutes or even seconds , which can lead to low self - esteem , and relationship difficulties he said : ‘ this drug is very interesting , and if trials are successful it could contribute towards treating this distressing condition			2
' but there is more to premature ejaculation than chemical imbalances , and there should always be some input from a psychosexual approach to help deal with relevant background issues that the patient may or may not be consciously aware of			0
’ meanwhile , doctors have developed a nasal spray containing oxytocin to treat migraine			0
in a new trial , patients will use the spray when they start to experience one of the excruciating headaches			0
the idea behind the drug , known as @entity127 and developed by @entity92 - based firm @entity128 , is that the drug travels through tissues in the nose to the trigeminal nerve , one of the main nerves in the face , which relays pain signals to the brain			1
the theory is that the drug interferes with these signals			2
small studies have suggested that the new oxytocin formulation is effective			0
in one trial , 42 per cent of patients had a significant reduction in pain two hours after using the drug , compared with 11 per cent of those in a control group			0
a trial with 240 patients is now underway in @entity93 and @entity150 .			2

treatment targets a hormone called oxytocin , which triggers ejaculation
called an oxytocin - antagonist , it stops oxytocin binding to cells in the body
theory is that by blocking the hormone , ejaculation can be delayed
drug is now being trialled in men aged 18 - 60 in @entity93 and the @entity92
