it was not feasible for us financially			2

let ’s not forget that for @entity2 it is not the first season but for @entity49 it is			1
so he will give him a fight and if @entity49 does n’t make it this year , he will give him a fight as well for next season			0
‘ i think everybody would agree @entity2 had a great season			2
he has found maturity that he did not have before			0
i believe his final ball is better , his personality on the pitch is stronger , the finishing aspect of his game is much better than before			0
‘ he can turn games when it ’s 0 - 0 and when it ’s tight			0
that ’s always a sign of top quality			0
