' shooter : @entity64 ( above ) killed a solider and opened fire on @entity5 before being shoot dead himself backing up her thoughts : @entity3 refused to back down after coming under fire on @entity7 ( above ) sorting things out : a short while later she composed a tweet trying to explain her thoughts ( above ) that 's when the tweets started rolling in attacking the 52 - year - old , who has never been shy about sharing her thoughts and beliefs			1
