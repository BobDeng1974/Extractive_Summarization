@entity0 my man of the year if you stopped the season right now , there would be four players in contention for player of the year : @entity9 for the purists , @entity11 for his power , @entity13 for his impact and @entity0 for his all - round game			1
for me , it would have to be @entity0			1
but it ’s time to forget the story around him			2
yes , he is a homegrown star , @entity21 ’s first since @entity20			1
yes , he plays like a fan on the pitch			2
but he is so much more than that now			0
he is a genuine , top quality talent			0
@entity0 races away to celebrate after he equalised in the second half at @entity28 @entity0 has scored 11 goals in his last 14 @entity21 matches , and four goals in his last two games			1
he managed just three last season it ’s hard to spot a weakness in his game			0
he takes up intelligent positions like his hero @entity38			0
he ’s got the strength to hold up the ball and hold off opponents			0
he can link up with team - mates or take the ball and run with it			2
he can shoot with either foot , hit them from distance or from close - range and he is outstanding in the air			2
he takes penalties , free - kicks and he works as hard as anybody on the pitch			2
@entity54 striker @entity11 ( left ) and @entity55 forward @entity13 ( right ) have been in fine form the big question for any young star is , can they do it in the big games ? just ask @entity63 and @entity64 whether @entity0 can			1
@entity21 fans are loving seeing ‘ one of their own ’ succeed , and there were six young players in saturday ’s starting @entity71 that the club have produced or helped develop			1
but it ’s @entity0 whose performances have dragged @entity21 into the @entity76 contention			1
that ’s why he ’s my player of the season so far			0
@entity54 midfielder @entity9 , celebrating scoring against @entity81 , has been outstanding for the @entity82 @entity21 academy graduate @entity0 roars in celebration after scoring his first derby goal on saturday city not so slick can @entity86 really be happy with how their season is going ? off the pace in the title race , just about in the @entity76 and out of the @entity90			1
for the squad they have , it ’s not good enough			0
yes , they have missed @entity95 , but at the start of the season people were ready to drop him			0
@entity86 ’s home form is far poorer than this time last year and they need a shift in mentality because they have to be switched on in every game			0
@entity103 is one for the future i spoke to @entity106 before his final @entity108 derby and he listed some of the most talented names at @entity111			1
on that list was @entity103			1
after his performance at @entity115 , you can see why			0
in what was a rather poor derby game , @entity103 ’s display was a bright spot			1
he was quick , sharp and desperately unlucky not to score			0
the shot he hit against the post was so pure that the ball barely moved in flight			0
@entity106 said @entity103 has a bit of @entity126 and @entity127 in him and that he could be one for @entity128 in the future			1
that ’s high praise indeed , though if @entity103 ’s career continues to blossom , i ’m sure he wo n’t be playing as a wing back for much longer			1
@entity103 of @entity111 competes with @entity135 and @entity136 of @entity137 on saturday @entity138 gets results away from the @entity141 , we had one of the results of the season in @entity145			1
@entity146 did n’t just beat their city rivals real , they completely thrashed them			1
it ’s not often you see @entity151 on the end of 4 - 0 scoreline , but @entity154 has created an incredible work ethic within his squad			2
they all work unbelievably hard for each other and play right on the limit of the rules , but that is how @entity154 likes his teams			0
he barks and snarls on the touchline and creates a frenzied atmosphere , and his players are desperate to please him — they even sprint when they are subbed off			0
it ’s like @entity154 has them all on a remote control			0
it ’s a unique style and i doubt it would work with a group of superstars , but it certainly gets results with @entity146			0
@entity154 celebrates a goal as his @entity146 side defeated @entity151 4 - 0 on saturday @entity54 have the ultimate warrior @entity178 has been a bit of a @entity54 hero recently			1
he scored the winner against @entity111 in that cup semi-final and ended the game with a boot full of blood			1
then he hits a stunner with his left at @entity188 to send @entity54 seven points clear			1
i think his left foot can be a bit of a swinger , but it did the business on saturday			0
he ’s not far off the @entity141 ’s top five goal - scoring defenders and when you consider how many games he ’s played , and that he does n’t take set pieces or penalties , it ’s an impressive record			2
@entity178 of @entity54 celebrates scoring the winning goal at @entity188 on saturday afternoon @entity203 wasted in midfield role i keep hearing @entity205 can do a job in midfield and that @entity208 can turn him into the new @entity209			1
@entity205 is a centre forward			1
that is his best position			0
nobody will convince me otherwise			0
he is @entity215 ’s best attacker and he should be up front affecting games			0
he has the ability to play in midfield , but that can happen in a few years ’ time			2
@entity220 wo n’t be picking @entity203 in midfield for @entity128 any time soon			2
@entity215 captain @entity205 attempts a pass against @entity222 at @entity223 on sunday i think @entity224 is taking the easy way out so he can play @entity226 and @entity227 up front and not upset anyone			2
but @entity203 ca n’t be enjoying it			0
it ’s easy for him to stroll around and ping passes but he should be banging in goals every week , not wasting his ability in midfield			2
do n't write off my @entity236 yet ... when my dad announced he was leaving @entity240 so he could have surgery , a lot of people assumed that was it for him			0
at 67 and after nine clubs as a player and manager , surely it was time to retire			0
do n’t count on it			0
why ? my dad is football mad			0
it ’s all he ’s ever known and when you have it in your blood it ’s hard to let go			0
his timing has always been bad but he loves the stress of management , so i would n’t be surprised to see him back			0
mum will be glad to have him out of the house , too ! @entity261 , in the dugout for @entity240 , resigned from the club earlier this month @entity264 's @entity141 number crunching 7 - @entity137 are having a hard time finding the net at the moment , and have scored just seven goals in their last 10 @entity141 matches - just two this year ! when you consider they did n’t manage a single shot on target against @entity111 until the 87th minute , it ’s not hard to see why			1
it ’s not all bad news though - they have kept three @entity141 clean sheets for the first time since november 2013			2
131 - after saturday ’s match , there have now been 131 @entity141 goals scored in @entity21 v @entity55 matches - no other fixture has seen as many			1
1 - @entity21 have lost just one of their last seven @entity141 home games against north @entity287 rivals @entity55 ( @entity288 4 , drawn 2 , lost 1 )			1
striker @entity289 of @entity290 celebrates scoring the opener against @entity292 on saturday 1999 - every goal scored in the match between @entity295 and @entity296 was headed — the first time all goals in a game of four or more were scored in this fashion since september 1999 ( @entity301 v @entity300 )			1
12 - @entity21 have won 12 points from goals scored in the final five minutes of @entity141 games this season - twice as many as any other side			1
36 - after finding the net against @entity292 , @entity290 striker @entity289 has scored at least one league goal against every current @entity141 side			1
4 - @entity86 have gone four @entity141 games without a win for the first time since november 2009			2
on the plus side , however , @entity313 ended a 36 - game run without a @entity141 goal on saturday .			2

@entity21 striker @entity0 scored twice to beat rivals @entity55 2 - 1
@entity103 impresses for @entity111 in the @entity108 draw at @entity137
@entity54 defender @entity178 keeps impressing for the @entity82
@entity205 has been *deployed* in midfield recently by @entity208
