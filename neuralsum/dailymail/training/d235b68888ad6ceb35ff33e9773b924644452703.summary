by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 chef @entity3 lost 6st in just over a year and transformed himself into a super-trim , super-fit athlete			1
at nearly 18st and clinically obese , @entity3 's self esteem was at a low ebb and he hated seeing pictures of himself			1
his job as a chef saw him surrounded by food and eating at least three to four times just during the working day			1
' my wife @entity19 and i both piled on weight in our late teens			1
we 'd started earning our own money and most of it went on takeaways and nights out			0
' getting a job as a chef did n't help			0
i spent my days picking at food and could easily eat three or four times a day at work			1
i was a lot less active than i had been when i was younger , too – and it showed			0
although happily engaged to @entity19 ( right ) , @entity3 's weight meant his self confidence was at an all time low @entity19 and @entity3 , pictured together recently , embarked on their weight loss journey together , with @entity19 losing over 3st before the wedding @entity3 and @entity19 were originally motivated to lose weight when they started planning their wedding ' on the one hand , i was really happy and secure with @entity19			1
on the other , my confidence had taken a real nosedive and i was very self - conscious about my size			0
i had to buy @entity50 clothes online and i hated seeing photographs of myself – there 's a picture of me at a wedding and i swear i 've got three chins			2
' around 18 months ago , @entity3 and @entity19 began planning our their wedding and decided it was time for them both to lose weight			1
but when @entity3 was persuaded to join a weight loss group with his fiancée , he was shocked to discover his constant snacking had caused his weight to rise into the clinically obese category - putting him at increased risk for a range of illnesses and conditions			1
' @entity19 suggested we join @entity71 and to say i was n't looking forward to it is an understatement			1
i thought it was somewhere only women went – no place for a young bloke like me ! @entity3 reached his target of 11st 5lb two days before his wedding , and the couple looked stunning on the day ' once i was eventually coaxed inside , i soon realised i 'd been completely wrong			1
i was n't the only man there and everyone was incredibly friendly			0
' discovering i was 17st 12lb – and clinically obese – was a proper wake - up call , so i was delighted when i lost 6lb in the first week			2
especially as neither of us could believe we were still able to eat so much			2
' the couple began to totally change their lives , overhauling their diet and incorporating exercise into their routines			1
more of @entity3 's story appears in the new men section in the october issue of @entity71 ' we soon got into the habit of planning our meals at the start of each week – one of my favourites is homemade burgers and chips made with low - calorie cooking spray and served with piles of fresh vegetables			1
we still have a night out or a takeaway once a week too			0
' after i 'd lost 3st , i decided to join a local gym			2
my first visit was like the first @entity71 experience all over again : i expected everyone there to be toned and intimidating			2
instead it was really welcoming			0
i started running , too – walking and jogging at first , then building up gradually until recently i completed a 10km race			0
' @entity3 found the weight dropping off quickly , despite continuing his job as a chef , and managed to lose an incredible 6st in the 18 months before his wedding			1
the biggest boost came when i went to see my gp a couple of months ago			2
when i walked in , he glanced from me to his computer screen and said , ' sorry – i think i 've got the wrong person			0
it says here you 're nearly 18st '			2
he was really impressed by my weight loss and agreed that i could stop using my asthma inhalers			0
a lot of people have commented on how hard it must have been to lose weight working as a chef			2
the difference is that i have the know - how to make healthier choices now			0
and when i check the food i 'm cooking , i just taste a small spoonful rather than eating loads			0
i reached my target of 11st 5lb two days before our wedding – a loss of 6st 7lb			1
@entity19 's lost 3st 7lb , too			1
even though we 've always been very happy with each other , we were n't happy with ourselves			0
' now we both have so much more energy and confidence			0
we 're excited about starting our married life together			0
' @entity3 's full story appears in the october 2014 issue of @entity151 , which features the title 's first ever men 's @entity152 ' and is on sale now in @entity71 groups and on newsstands			1
