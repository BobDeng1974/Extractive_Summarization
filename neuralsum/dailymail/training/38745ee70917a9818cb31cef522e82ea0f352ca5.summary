researchers have made an exact copy of a dinosaur fossil covered in plaster - without having to crack open its protective case			1
the technique , which uses a ct scanner and 3d printer , could help scientists analyse fossils in casings without risking damage to it in the process			1
scientists also hope the method will allow scientists to share replicas of fossils that are too delicate to be passed around			1
researchers have made an exact copy , pictured right , of a dinosaur fossil covered in plaster - without having to crack open its protective case , pictured left			1
the technique , which uses a ct scanner and 3d printer , could help scientists analyse fossils in casings without risking damage to it in the process researchers performed ct scans on the unidentified fossil with a 320 - slice multi-detector system			1
the different absorption of radiation through the bone compared with the surrounding material provided a clear image of a fossilised vertebral body			0
the @entity45 study also provided valuable information about the condition of the fossil , showing multiple fractures			2
it helped the researchers build an accurate reconstruction of the fossil with selective laser sintering - a technology that uses a high - powered laser to fuse together materials to make a 3d object			2
fossils are often stored in plaster casts , or jackets , to protect them from damage			1
getting information about a fossil often means breaking the plaster open , which can damage or destroy the fossil itself			2
@entity69 researchers studied the feasibility of using ct and 3d printers to non-destructively separate fossilised bone from its surrounding material and produce a 3d print of the bone			2
‘ the most important benefit of this method is that it is non-destructive , and the risk of harming the fossil is minimal , ’ said dr @entity76 , from the @entity77 in @entity78			0
dr @entity76 and colleagues applied the method to an unidentified fossil from the @entity88 , a major natural history museum in @entity78			2
the fossil and others like it were buried under rubble in the basement of the museum after a @entity96 bombing raid			0

the different absorption of radiation through the bone compared with the surrounding material provided a clear image needed to make the copy , pictured but museum staff had difficulty identifying some of the plaster jackets			0

after studying the ct scan and comparing it to old excavation drawings , the researchers were able to trace the fossil 's origin to the excavation , a major dig from 1910 to 1927 in a clay pit south of @entity123 , @entity69			1

dr @entity76 said that the findings come at a time when advances in technology and cheaper availability of 3d printers are making them more common as a tool for research			0
‘ the digital dataset and , ultimately , reproductions of the 3d print may easily be shared , and other research facilities could thus gain valuable informational access to rare fossils , which otherwise would have been restricted , ’ dr @entity76 said			0
‘ just like @entity164 's printing press opened the world of books to the public , digital datasets and 3d prints of fossils may now be distributed more broadly , while protecting the original intact fossil			1

the exact fossil copy was created using a ct scanner and 3d printer

after studying the @entity45 scan researchers were able to trace the fossil 's origin to a major dig from 1910 to 1927
method set to be used in the *future* to share replicas too delicate to handle
