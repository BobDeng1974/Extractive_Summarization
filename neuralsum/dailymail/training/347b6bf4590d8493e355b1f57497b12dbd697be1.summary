with less than a week of the transfer window to go , clubs will be trying to tie up deals to get the players they want			1
here @entity5 looks at 10 transfers all football fans want to see happen before the february 2 deadline			1
@entity10 - @entity9 to @entity11 - £ 12m the 29 - year - old striker has reportedly fallen out of favour with @entity9 coach @entity14 and wants a move away from @entity16			1
@entity11 sent scouts to watch the 1 - 0 win over @entity19 on sunday but @entity10 only played nine minutes after coming on as a late substitute			2
the only stumbling block to any potential move is the fact that @entity10 wants to play @entity25 football - something @entity11 ca n't guarantee			1
@entity10 ( left ) is available for £ 12million and was reportedly watched by @entity11 scouts on sunday @entity28 - @entity27 to @entity29 - £ 7m the 25 - year - old winger is wanted by @entity29 and @entity31 , as well as @entity32			1
@entity29 have asked but been told @entity28 is close to joining @entity31			0
however , the @entity34 club want to wait until the summer for a deal when the player is out of contract and @entity29 may be able to steal him away if they offer @entity27 enough money in the next week			0
@entity28 ( right ) is in demand with @entity29 , @entity31 and @entity32 keen on the winger @entity9 to @entity41 - £ 60m @entity42 is an admirer of the 20 - year - old centre back and @entity41 have asked about his availability			0
@entity41 value the @entity46 at £ 30m but @entity9 have told them to beat the £ 50m they paid for @entity50 from @entity51			0
with @entity41 's defence still adjusting to @entity55 's tactics and the race for the @entity25 heating up , the @entity52 may be tempted to put in a world - record bid for a defender to boost his chances of recording a successful first season at @entity62			0
@entity9 centre back @entity63 has been linked with a move away from the @entity16 champions @entity67 - @entity29 to @entity31 - £ 25m @entity31 like the 24 - year - old midfielder but will have to put in a mega offer to tempt @entity29 to sell a player @entity70 brought with him from @entity71			1
@entity72 were primed with a bid before january but realised it would take at least £ 25m and @entity31 have considered offering @entity74 and @entity75 plus money , but it still may fall short this month			2
@entity67 ( left ) is a transfer target for @entity31 but @entity29 do not wish to sell their man @entity81 - @entity80 to @entity82 - £ 1m the former @entity41 and @entity80 striker reportedly wants to leave @entity16 and return to the @entity84 due to a lack of playing time			1
the enigmatic 33 - year - old could provide the lift @entity82 need in their fight against relegation			0
@entity81 is handsomely paid in the principality but is wanted by a raft of @entity84 clubs @entity94 - @entity93 to @entity11 - £ 8m @entity11 have predominately focused on bringig in younger players but @entity97 is a fan of the @entity93 midfielder , who is refusing to sign a new contract			1
city are increasingly worried that the 29 - year - old may leave at the end of the season on a free and could be tempted to sell this january			2
reds target @entity94 ( left ) tries to hold off @entity106 's @entity105 during @entity100 's 2 - 0 @entity108 defeat @entity110 - @entity109 to @entity93 - £ 30m the former @entity51 man has blossomed since moving back to @entity112 , so much so that his international team - mate @entity113 has urged @entity100 to buy him			1
with their title challenge faltering , @entity114 has splashed the cash on £ 28m @entity118 but @entity119 will provide added creativity from midfield that @entity100 have been lacking			0
@entity93 are interested in former @entity51 man @entity110 , who is now at @entity109 @entity123 - @entity51 to @entity11 - £ 7m much of @entity11 's problems this season have stemmed from the mistakes of @entity127 in goal and they have been linked with a host of keepers this window			1
the 32 - year - old @entity123 's agent certainly has n't played down a move to @entity134 , but with @entity136 having already left @entity137 this month a deal looks more likely in the summer			2
@entity11 need a keeper and ca n't afford any more mistakes if they want @entity25 football next season , which may force them to act quickly			2
@entity123 looks helplessly on after conceding against @entity143 during @entity51 's 4 - 2 defeat on saturday @entity146 - @entity145 to @entity31 - £ 16m the @entity52 winger shot to prominence after an impressive @entity148 last summer and has also been linked with a reunion with @entity55 at @entity41			1
@entity31 are keen to sign the 20 - year - old before the end of the window , however , having missed out on him last year			0
@entity146 scores for @entity145 against @entity153 earlier this month @entity154 - @entity155 to @entity156 the @entity157 under 20 international is out of contract in the summer and has so far not signed a new deal offered to him by the club			0
scouts have been watching the 19 - year - old play for @entity41 's @entity164 and during his two loan spells at @entity167			0
@entity169 scouts saw him score against @entity112 and he has been recommended to serie a leaders @entity172			0
@entity155 have offered a new contract to their highly - rated teenager @entity154			0

@entity10 , @entity123 and @entity94 all linked with @entity11
@entity93 risk losing @entity94 for free if they do n't sell him this month
@entity31 want @entity146 and @entity67
@entity31 old boy @entity81 fancies a fresh crack at the @entity84
january transfer window closes on february 2
