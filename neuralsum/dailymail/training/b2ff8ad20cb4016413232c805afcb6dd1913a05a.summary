by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor the new foreign secretary @entity2 said @entity4 's relationship with the @entity5 was ' not acceptable ' @entity4 will vote to leave the @entity5 if @entity6 does not hand back powers to @entity8 , @entity2 said this morning			1
the new foreign secretary said the current relationship with @entity6 was ' not acceptable ' and needed to be overhauled before giving the public a say in 2017			0
but he added : ' if the offer by @entity16 partners is nothing , no change , no negotiation , i am pretty clear what the answer of the @entity4 people in that referendum is going to be			1
' mr @entity2 has previously said he would vote to leave the @entity5 under the current circumstances			2
the foreign secretary was asked whether he stood by his earlier position that @entity4 should vote to leave an unreformed @entity5			1
he said : ' the status quo is not in @entity4 ’s interest and we have to negotiate - the way we ’re doing this , if we have a @entity33 government after the next election , there will be a referendum in 2017 so the @entity4 people will decide			0
' the foreign secretary added : ' there has to be substantive renegotiation , substantive change in @entity16 , that addresses the concerns that @entity4 has , but also addresses the needs of @entity16 in a modern world and then we ’ll put it to the @entity4 people and they ’ll make the decision			1
' my job now is to pursue that renegotiation … when we get to the end of that process and we can see what is on offer , what is on the table , we will then make our recommendation to the @entity4 people			2
' i have n’t change my mind			0
if there is no change at all in the way @entity16 is governed , no change in the balance of competencies between the nation states and the @entity5 , no resolution of the challenge of how the @entity62 can succeed and co-exist with the @entity63 , that is not a @entity16 that can work for @entity4 in the future so there must be change , there must be renegotiation			1

' increasingly , across the @entity5 people are realising that @entity16 needs reform			2
' it needs reform to deal with the globalisation , the world economic situation , it needs reform to deal with the challenge of a @entity62 coexisting with the @entity63 countries in the world			0
and it needs reform to deal with @entity4 ’s specific grievances			0

@entity100 *cabinet* minister says there has to be a ' substantive renegotiation '
