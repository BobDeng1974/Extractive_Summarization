by @entity0 the heroics of the men who fought valiantly to take @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity6 beaches on @entity7 will never be forgotten but the stories of those who died are less well - remembered			1
now letters written by men preparing for @entity7 and who did n't make it home are to be brought to life in a poignant documentary made to mark the 70th anniversary of the landings			1
among the accounts to appear on @entity17 from @entity7 is the story of captain @entity19 , 38 , from @entity20 in @entity21			1
fallen heroes : rifleman @entity23 , left , was shot while captain @entity19 , right , was killed by a bomb ahead of the assault on @entity28 beaches , which would help @entity29 , captain @entity19 wrote to his wife of eight years with whom he had two young daughters , @entity32 and @entity33			1
' as you know anything may happen at any moment and i can not tell when you will receive this , ' he noted			2
' all the things i intended to say must be written			2
' the former insurance worker confessed to feeling nervous ahead of the battle but said morale was high			1
' i 'm not a dashing hero by any means but the influence of everyone around me and the confidence of all the troops has made me lose any early fear which i expected , ' he added			2
' whether it will last until the final moment i ca n't tell			2
i 'm sure anyone with with imagination must dislike the thought of what 's coming but my fears will be more of being afraid than of what can happen to me			2
' apprehension : many of the soldiers writing home confessed to being nervous at the thought of d - day the most moving parts of captain @entity19 's letters come as he tells his wife just how much she meant to him and how much he loved the life they shared			1
' you and i have had some lovely happy years that now seemed to have past at lightning speed but i , and i 'm sure you as well , can look back on them with some kind of contentment , knowing that in our love and need of each other , we have injured no - one , ' he said			2
' although i would give anything to be back with you , i have not had any wish to back down from the job we have to do			2
... ' although i would give anything to be back with you , i have not had any wish to back down from the job we have to do ' ' there is so much i mean to tell you , much of what you have heard before , but i mean it even more today			2
' i shall always be grateful to the powers above for having been able to be with you , to have been loved by you			0
i 'm sure i will be with you again soon and for good			0
give my fondest love to my @entity32 and my @entity98			0
' sadly captain @entity19 never made it home to his beloved family			1
instead , they were sent a telegram informing them he had been killed by a direct hit from an enemy bomb which fell on a dugout he was sheltering in on the beach			1
remember them : thousands of brave men from the @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity113 died on d - day another soldier writing home to tell his family how much he loved them was @entity121 farmer 's son , @entity119 , 22			1
' as usual there is n't much news but i am getting along fine and i 'm well , ' he wrote in a cheerful letter to his parents ahead of the attack on @entity129			1
' i suppose all the spring work on the farm is in full progress			0
so you still have n't had the veranda painted ? i guess i 'll have to get at it when i get back			0
' but he never made it home			1
although @entity138 survived the beach landing , he was shot down during an intense firefight further inland			0
brave : captain @entity142 kept a journal of his experience of @entity7 and capture by the @entity146 his mother received a letter from the regimental chaplain which explained : ' i am going to tell you the circumstances of his death , i think you would like to know them			1
' @entity23 ( and two others in his regiment ) went to the top of a hill next to the church , within a few minutes of their arrival they were heavily shelled by enemy artillery and all three were killed			0
' the chaplain then relates that when the bodies of the men were recovered , he and others in the regiment were moved to see they had been covered in flowers by @entity169 locals who were grateful to the soldiers for giving their lives to liberate them			1
as letters from the front line often took time to be sent , @entity23 's last letter to his parents actually arrived after they had received the news of his death			1
his parting words were : ' do n't you be worrying too hard about me			0
i 'm a pretty capable person , do n't worry about me			0
' meanwhile , @entity180 , 22 , a factory worker from @entity181 , wrote from the engine room of a air - sea rescue craft to his young wife @entity184			1
' i would like you to know just how i feel in this great adventure , ' he wrote			1
but he added : ' i 'm fully aware that you may never read it			0
you only will if i hand deliver it as it wo n't pass the censor			0
' happily for @entity184 , @entity180 was one of the lucky men who made it home and was able to deliver his letter to her in person			1
another lucky soldier was captain @entity142 , of the @entity199 of the @entity200 , who was married with two small children			1
' ... my love was with you when you needed it most , you have been very close to me this whole time ' he kept a journal of his experiences so he could share them with his wife @entity211			1
three days before d - day , not knowing exactly what lay ahead , he wrote : ' this morning this made me feel quite desperate â€¦ ' i felt a little empty			1
i am waiting so impatiently for news from you of yourself and my small sons , more than ever before in my life i am longing for you and if i am not able to send any letters at least i can write what i have to say in this little book and so express my emotions			1
' once ashore , he led his men in an assault on a wood , the brutality and panic of which he later described in harrowing detail			0
' suddenly an 88 got our range and up went our carrier in a deafening explosion with all our ammunition , knocking us all sideways			0
' there was nothing for it but to crawl - " @entity239 , " i shouted			0
and the next few minutes i felt were my last			0
' unto the breach : @entity112 troops wade ashore at @entity244 during the @entity28 d - day landings captain @entity142 was later declared missing in action and his family had an agonising wait to see if he had survived			1
but he had in fact been captured by the @entity146 - and never knew why they did n't shoot him when they had the chance			0
once the @entity252 were victorious , he was able to write to @entity211 and tell her that he was alive and well			0
she wrote back to him telling of her joy			2
' i was so lucky to have my anxiety relieved			0
i ca n't describe what this has meant to me , ' she wrote			2
' i have been to church to be thankful for this miracle			0
' my love was with you when you needed it most , you have been very close to me this whole time , let us say that is the ticket			0
' she added : ' my darling keep going , au revioir , god bless , i love you			0
' he eventually returned home in 1945 and the couple had a third son			2
during the @entity276 documentary , captain @entity142 's son returns to @entity169 to retrace his father 's footsteps			2
the show also uses archive footage and speaks to veterans who lived to tell the tale			0
one veteran , @entity283 , said : ' i was glad i was there and twice as glad to get back			0
it was an experience i would n't have liked to have missed because there were some good times as well as bad times			0
' if @entity17 from @entity7 will be on @entity276 thursday 5 june at 10.35pm			1
