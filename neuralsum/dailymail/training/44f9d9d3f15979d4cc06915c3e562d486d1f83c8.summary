by @entity0 published : 05:04 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 06:00 est , 6 june 2013 the world 's oldest tumour has been discovered in the rib of a @entity4 who lived around 130,000 years ago			1
scientists at the @entity7 took x-rays of the inch - long rib fragments - first found in the @entity11 rock shelters of @entity12 - and discovered parts of the inner bone were missing			1
following @entity15 scans the scientists discovered that this was likely to have been caused by soft - tissue tumour known in modern - day patients as fibrous dysplasia			1
scans found that a small part of the inner bone network was missing and had been ' eaten away ' by a soft - tissue tumour			1
this condition is called fibrous dysplasia fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with soft fibrous bone tissue			1
it can cause abnormal growth or swelling of the bone			2
although it can occur in any part of the skeleton the soft tumours are most commonly found in the skull , thigh , shin , ribs , upper arm and pelvis fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure			1
the disorder is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood			0
males and females of any race are equally affected			0
the bones studied by @entity7 university anthropologist @entity52 and his team were first excavated more than 100 years ago in @entity12			1
the site , known as the @entity11 rock shelter , in the north of the country held more than 900 @entity4 bones dating back from between 120,000 and 130,000 years ago			1
@entity52 wanted to scan the bones because many of them showed signs of trauma and marks that happened after the neanderthal had died			0
many of the 900 neanderthal bones found in @entity12 had evidence of trauma or possible bite marks			1
this scan taken during the 1980s by researchers in @entity73 has a white area of overexposure which was the first evidence that a tumour had ' eaten away ' the bone the detailed scans show exactly where the bone has been ' eaten away ' these marks suggest either cannibalism or burial rituals			1
researchers from the @entity85 took x-rays of the bones during the 1980s and published a book containing all the radiographs			0
one of the inch - long rib fragments was shown to have sections of bone that were ' burned out ' in the x-ray images			1
' burned out ' sections of x-rays suggest over exposure , and in the rib bones this overexposure was caused by missing bone in the inner part of the fragment			2
@entity52 used these images as a guide to take new , higher - resolution x-rays of the specimens			0
his team also scanned the bones using high - resolution @entity109 scanners that doctors currently use on modern - day patients			2
the @entity109 scan found that the ' spongy bone ' which should be on the inner part of the fragment was missing and may have been ' eaten away ' by a soft - tissue tumour			1
this type of tumour is seen in modern - day patients and is called fibrous dysplasia			2
fibrous dysplasia is an abnormal bone growth where normal bone is replaced with fibrous bone tissue			2
it can cause abnormal growth or swelling of the bone and although it can occur in any part of the skeleton , it is most commonly found in the skull , thigh , shin , ribs , upper arm and pelvis fibrous dysplasia is not cancerous but is rare and there is no known cure			2
@entity52 reported the findings in the journal @entity141			0
he told livescience : ' people of that time did n't live as long as they did today ; plus , there were n't very many of them compared to the @entity146 and people today			2
' finding evidence of tumors and evidence of cancers , is - i do n't know if i want to say " lucky " - but there is n't a lot of evidence for it			2
' it was previously thought that climate change and a reduction in tree cover forced early man to stand up , but now experts believe the rocky @entity163 landscape played a far more significant role describing the type of tumour that was found , @entity52 added : ' they range all the way from being totally benign , where you would n’t recognize them , to being extremely painful			1
' the size of this one , and the bulging of it , probably caused the individual pain			0
' previously the earliest known tumours were found in @entity146 mummies dating back 4,000 years so this discovery predates this find significantly			1
a study released earlier this month discovered that @entity4 lost out to homo sapiens in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt			0
the results showed that modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and @entity4 died out much sooner than was estimated			0
neanderthals had larger eyes than @entity187 but did not develop brain power in the same way			0
this meant that @entity187 were able to outsmart and ultimately outlive @entity4 who had to use their brains more for physical rather than mental needs neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans , according to new research			1
chemical analysis of a neanderthal child 's tooth reveal it was reared on mother 's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same period coupled with solid food			0
the change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the distribution of barium – a similar compound to calcium - in teeth enamel			0
this enabled dr @entity214 and colleagues at @entity216 in @entity217 to discover the early life diet of a 10 to 12 year - old child that lived in a cave in @entity223 around 100,000 years ago			1
the brains of @entity4 were the same size as those of modern man but more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger bodies			0
researchers from the @entity233 additionally found that early man began to walk on two feet because of rocky terrain and not climate change			0
the study found that our upright gait may have its origins in the rugged landscape of @entity242 and @entity243 which was shaped during the @entity245 epoch by volcanoes and shifting tectonic plates			0
@entity248 , human 's early ancestors , would have been attracted to the terrain of rocky outcrops and gorges because it offered shelter and opportunities to trap prey			0
but it also required more upright scrambling and climbing gaits , prompting the emergence of bipedalism .			0

rib is up to 130,000 years old and was found in a cave in @entity11 , @entity12
scientists scanned the bone and found evidence of a soft - tissue tumour
the earliest tumours previously discovered were found in 4,000 - year - old @entity146 mummies
