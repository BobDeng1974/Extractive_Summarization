by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 08:16 est , 19 december 2012 he is known as ' sir hairdryer ' for his habit of bawling football players out in the locker room			1

back to the classroom : sir @entity6 flew to @entity18 to talk to students at @entity17 and while his technique does undoubtedly involve a lot of shouting badly - performing players out , it also involves compassion and praise			1
' for a player - and any human being - there 's nothing better than hearing " well done " , ' sir @entity6 told the researchers			1
' those are the two best words ever invented in sports			0
' there 's no doubting his approach works			0

' challenge : sir @entity6 has had to change his approach over the years professor @entity54 and @entity55 worked with sir @entity6 for months to produce their study , entitled sir @entity6 : managing @entity7			1
it reveals his blueprint for planning the season , match - day rituals , the players he targets , keeping control of the dressing room and the mistakes he made			2
the study also shows how he prepares his team , the way he conducts his team - talks and how he changes a game 's direction at half - time			2
sir @entity6 said : ' players these days have lived more sheltered lives , so they are much more fragile now than 25 years ago			1
‘ i was very aggressive all those years ago			0
i am passionate and want to win all the time			0
but today i ’m more mellow			0
' and i can better handle those more fragile players now			2
there ’s all this hype about hairdryers and anger and so on			0
' you ca n't always come in shouting and screaming			0
' but there ’s another side to it , which is more in terms of how i have fostered relations with people and developed the team over the years			0
' his longtime secretary @entity91 told researchers : ' if someone knocks on his door and they have a problem , the first thing he does is turn the chair around and say " sit down , let 's talk "			0
sir @entity6 also visited @entity17 to take a class on management			1
he told the official college newspaper @entity103 : ' when you 're approached by an institution like @entity17 , you know you are dealing with top quality			0
' i had to consider that i was opening myself up to something i 've never done before			0
' but at this stage of my life , i felt that i 'm helping young people progress through their own routes to management , then ultimately that was an important and compelling factor for me			0
' the part of the discussion from which i learned the most about myself was when they were discussing the balance between ' fear ' and ' love ' in my approach to managing people			2
' if you look at my history , there 's all this hype about hairdryers and anger and so on			0
' but the students acknowledged another side to it , which is more apt in terms of how i 've fostered relations with people and developed the team over the years			0
' the @entity7 manager also gave an impromptu pep talk to the college 's american football team			1
head coach @entity141 said : ' they were expecting me to come in and given them the practice plan and in walks @entity6			2
