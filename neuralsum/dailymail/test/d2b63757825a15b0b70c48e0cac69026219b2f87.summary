for some expectant mothers , giving up alcohol or coffee for the duration of their pregnancy can feel a hardship			0
but one mother - to - be had to give up much more than that for the sake of her unborn daughter			2
@entity11 , from @entity12 , had to stop taking medication that enables her to move without pain as she suffers from a painful and crippling condition callled hip displasia			1
@entity11 and husband @entity18 tried for a baby for three years so when she fell pregnant , she did n't want to take any risks so stopped taking pain relief for her scoliosis and hip dysplasia symptoms the condition means the ball and socket joint of her hip has not formed properly , which causes pain when she moves			1
she also has scoliosis ( curvature of the spine )			2
due to her disabilities , @entity11 has to walk with a crutch around the home and uses a wheelchair when out and about			1
she also needs to take painkillers to give her some respite from the daily discomfort			0
but after becoming pregnant with a baby girl after three years of trying to conceive with husband , @entity18 , @entity11 chose to stop taking the drugs for the time she carried their baby			1
she made the brave decision even though the weight of her baby bump put extra strain on her joints			2
' i decided i would stop taking my painkillers when pregnant as there was n't 100 per cent proof it would all be okay for baby so i stopped to be on the safe side , ' she explained on @entity60 , which airs tonight on @entity61			0
@entity11 explains when pregnant that she 's prepared to forgo pain relief for the sake of her baby @entity65 was then delivered via caesarean section but @entity11 had hoped for a natural birth ' she 's so special and it took such a long time to get her , i do n't want to do anything to risk the pregnancy			1
' @entity18 , an it consultant , said he understood @entity11 's decision but he said he found it hard to see her suffering			2
' she wants to be a normal mother and do everything normally but because of her condition she 's not always able to , ' he said			0
' my admiration for her has grown , the pain she goes through daily has increased and got worse every day			0
coping with that without pain killers is a big thing			0
' ' the pain she 's going through on a daily basis has increased			0
' @entity11 , who has only 30 per cent mobility with her hips , said her problems began when she was a small child			1
' the pain started when i was quite young and i had the first surgery when i was five			0
' growing up i had a lot of hip pain and back pain and initially i did n't know what it was			0
as a teenager i had to wear a body brace which was difficult			0
' her mother @entity100 said : ' as a child she would never show when things hurt			0
you 'd ask how she was feeling and she 'd say " i 'm fine " , she would always cover everything up and tell you what you wanted to hear to make you feel better			0
' @entity11 's condition was diagnosed as a teenager and she has always been determined not to let her disability get in the way of her living a ' normal ' life			2
she works as an occupational therapist for the @entity113 , plays wheelchair tennis and wanted to be able to deliver her baby naturally despite her hip problems			1
despite her hip problems , @entity11 , pictured in hospital with @entity18 and @entity65 after her birth , had wanted a natural delivery but had to have a c - section as @entity65 was breeched adjusting to life as a mother with limited mobility means @entity11 has had a chairlift installed in her home the new mother is determined not to let her disabilities get in her way however , this was not possible in the end as her baby was in the breech position so she had to have her daughter , @entity65 , via a caesarean section			1
@entity11 said afterwards : ' it 's been a hard journey but well worth it			2
@entity11 has to allow changes she 's always resisted - such as having a chairlift installed in their home - to take place so she can better care for @entity65 with her physical limitations			1
@entity11 admits she 's always tried to do things for herself but she admits as a new mother , she has to accept more help for the sake of her daughter			1
following the safe arrival of @entity65 , the couple had an anxious six week wait to find out if she also has hip dysplasia as there is thought to be genetic link			1
those with hip dysplasia are five to ten times times more likely to have baby with condition and it 's more common in female and first - born babies			1
@entity11 and @entity18 return to hospital six weeks after @entity65 's birth to hear the good news that she does n't also have hip dysplasia as there is a genetic link the couple were delighted when a scan revealed @entity65 does not have the condition			1
however , if she did , the fact it had been detected early would mean doctors would be able to help her			0
this was something @entity11 was keen to pursue as her own late diagnosis contributed to the mobility problems she has now			1
' i 'm so pleased she does n't have to go through any of it , ' she said after hearing @entity65 's six week scan gave her the all clear			2
' if i have any doubts in my mind or as she 's growing up i will push for her to be checked again			0
' my @entity181 pregnancy is on @entity61 mondays at 9pm			0
