by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 11:28 est , 16 october 2013 miss @entity1 collided with a lorry outside @entity4 while she rode home the family of the first person to be killed on a ' @entity8 ' watched as the moment she was knocked off her wheels by a lorry was shown to her inquest			1
the parents , brother and sisters of @entity16 , 20 , wept as @entity18 footage was played showing the moment the @entity20 - born student died			1
coroner @entity21 warned the images were ' very very graphic ' as she prepared the @entity23 and the hgv driver @entity24 , who was at the wheel , for the emotional evidence			1
the family watched the @entity18 footage , taken from different cameras , showing @entity31 as she collided with a lorry outside @entity4 while she rode home to @entity34 , in east @entity35 , on july 5			1
she was cycling along one of the @entity35 mayor â€™s so - called flagship commuter cycle routes , though the section she was in provides no segregated space for cycling			1
the coroner had introduced the footage with a ' very strong warning ' that it shows ' @entity45 coming off her bike and i imagine it would be very distressing for her family '			2
turning to mr @entity24 , she added : ' i know this will be very upsetting for you too			1
' mr @entity24 , an hgv driver for about 22 years , told @entity52 in east @entity35 that he had been travelling at around 10 - 12mph in the slow - moving peak traffic at about 7pm			1
he was approaching the crossroads and the traffic lights were probably on red			0
there was scaffolding from building works at one side of the road			0
she was cycling along one of @entity35 's commuter cycle routes , though the section she was in provides no segregated space for cycling mr @entity24 told the inquest the first he knew of the crash was the sound of a ' tinkling or rattling noise which i thought was my mirrors catching the scaffolding			1
' he added : ' then i could see a young lady tumbling backwards off her bike			0
' his lorry was positioned ' squarely ' in the lane , the court heard			2
within minutes , an ambulance was at the scene and a bus driver and passers - by had stopped to try to help			2
miss @entity1 , who suffered a collapsed left lung , died of multiple injuries miss @entity1 , who suffered a collapsed left lung , was rushed to the nearby @entity89 but died of multiple injuries			1
asked by the coroner if in hindsight there was anything he could have done differently , mr @entity24 shook his head and said ' no '			1
asked if there was anything he could suggest to help with the safety of road cyclists , he told the court : ' possibly with the bicycle hire scheme - the @entity8 - they could give reflective clothing with the bikes for the riders			0
' on seeing the crash , bus driver @entity104 hit a special button in his cab which contacted the emergency services , he told the inquest			1
he noticed it was ' very narrow ' between the lorry and the scaffolding			2
' it did not occur to me that she collided with the lorry but she did seem to wobble slightly , at which point she fell backwards to her right side and into the lorry , ' he recalled			1
' i really feel there was not sufficient space for @entity45 to pass or attempt to pass the lorry			2
i think the gap was too small to go by the lorry safely			0
' asked by the coroner for some potential safety points , he suggested that perhaps roads should be kerbed off for riders at junctions , and high visibility clothes for them would also be helpful			0
investigating officer pc @entity132 told the inquest the front of the lorry collided with the rear wheel of the bicycle			1
miss @entity16 had been riding on the footpath before passing the scaffolding , possibly in a move to try to get past a bus			0
pc @entity132 said : ' @entity45 is coming down the passenger side of the lorry			0
the lorry has just started moving but she is moving faster and is able to move in front of the lorry			0
' their speeds , at some point , would be the same but the lorry is still able to go quicker and collides with the rear of the bicycle			0
' miss @entity1 's mother , @entity156 ( centre ) , pleaded for road safety for cyclists in @entity35 to be tackled ' now and quickly ' @entity18 of the dreadful moment the student came off her bike was played at @entity52 there would have been about 3.72 seconds in which miss @entity16 could have been spotted , according to @entity165			1
he went on : ' as mr @entity24 conducted his pre-movement check in the mirrors , @entity45 was riding on the footpath - at best she would have been on the very limit of his view			1
' with the other pedestrians at the bus stop and milling around , it would have been quite difficult for him to recognise her as a bicycle rider			0
' miss @entity1 's mother , @entity156 , pleaded for road safety for cyclists in @entity35 to be tackled ' now and quickly '			1
through an interpreter , she told the court : ' i do not reside here - i live in @entity20 - but i am speaking for people who still live and will be living in @entity35			2
' there were a number of factors that have come together			0
the accident did happen , but as @entity45 's mum i have seen the impact on all those people who cycle			2
' the accident @entity45 had was the straw that broke the camel 's back			0
' the problem with cycle lanes here in @entity35 is not a new problem			1
things have been asked by cyclists - if anything had been done , it has not been helpful to cyclists			0
' i have heard the clothing that cyclists wear and what @entity45 should have been wearing was discussed here			0
' what needs to be discussed is the provisions of lanes for cyclists			0
action needs to be taken			0
' today it is my family who is living in this situation and it is also the driver 's family too			2
significant action must be taken now and quickly			0
