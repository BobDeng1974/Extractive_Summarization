by @entity0 @entity1 expressed one final thought before leaving the @entity3 ’ dinner at @entity5 on tuesday night			1
‘ i ’ve got a good feeling about this one , ’ he said			2
good feelings abound at the start of the 143rd @entity9			1
there is hardly a big name in the sport who is not coming here feeling good about his game			2
after a slow start to the season , the stars are all flexing their muscles			0
@entity19 won in @entity20 in may			1
@entity21 has won his last two events			1
@entity23 was a classy winner of both the @entity25 and the @entity26 ’ @entity9			1
walking tall : @entity21 goes into @entity9 in great form having won his last two tournaments @entity29 has reached the summit of the game , @entity32 has triumphed in @entity33 while defending champion @entity34 looked like he made a breakthrough with his putting last week			1
there is no sport like this one for upsetting the odds but it will be a surprise if this major does not run close to form			2
this edition is due to begin with a blessed day , and every competitor will be looking to make a first - round statement given a forecast of virtually unbroken sunshine and a gentle breeze			0
nobody could quibble with the number of hours the @entity48 are showing but some spectacular rounds might be heading for home by the time they come on air at 9am			0
starting proceedings : @entity56 golfer @entity55 will get @entity9 underway with @entity57 @entity57 and @entity55 , for instance , are in the first group out at 6.30am			1
two years after pulling out of @entity9 with a sad case of the yips , @entity55 is more than capable of posting a score that could stand all day , as is fellow nice guy @entity57			1
‘ no problem for me getting up at that hour raring to go , ’ said @entity64 , the father of seven - month - old twins			0
‘ getting up at 5am is a lie - in for me			0
’ @entity68 , his playing partner @entity69 , and @entity19 are off shortly after the television coverage begins and will inevitably carry much of the early interest			1
given the forecast , it will be something of a surprise if @entity19 does not add to his impressive list of low first - round scores			1
as for @entity68 , who knows what might happen			1
would anyone be shocked if he shot 68 or 78 ? the suspense simply adds to the anticipation			0
eyes on the prize : @entity19 will tee off with @entity68 and @entity69 on thursday morning @entity68 has not won a major for more than six years but the 14 - time champion remains on pace , nonetheless , to catch @entity87 ’s total of 18 majors			1
the @entity87 also had 14 at the age of 38 and won his 15th at his 66th attempt			0
this is 38 - year - old @entity68 ’s 65th major , and he will play his next two on courses where he has won			1
yes , it remains close			0
and then there is @entity97			0
it is 45 years since an @entity64 won on @entity20 soil , when @entity100 unleashed his ‘ corking ’ drive of legend down the 18th hole at @entity104			0
@entity105 is here this week , and the 70 - year - old is as keen as anyone for the long wait to end			0
‘ given the form he is in and the fact he ’s a proven major winner , you ’d have to think @entity21 has a great chance , ’ he said			1
yet has he peaked too early , with his win in @entity115 and sumptuous illustration of links play at @entity118 last week ? @entity97 has certainly got the right attitude			0
‘ if i had n’t won last week i think this event would be a realistic opportunity for me to win , so i do n’t see how it is less realistic because i did win , ’ he said			0
‘ the goal for me is to trust my game , and give myself that opportunity			0
’ sure thing : @entity97 says he trusts his game following successive @entity129 victories ahead of @entity9 how poetic if he were to prevail here , on the same stretch of @entity20 coastline where he emerged , with his stunning performance in finishing tied fourth as a 17 - year - old amateur at @entity136			1
three wins in a row sounds such a tall order but maybe , just maybe , the 33 - year - old is about to complete an unforgettable milestone for @entity143 golf			0
the last time @entity9 was played at @entity146 it was won by the world no 1 , and what a contrast he makes with the current holder			1
when @entity68 turned up on sunday , 3,000 people showed up to follow him around			1
out on the links , @entity29 was an almost solitary figure			1
under the radar - as much as any man can be occupying top spot - is how @entity29 likes it but nobody is fooled			1
he is the favourite on merit			0
two years ago @entity29 led at @entity104 by four shots with four holes to play but still lost to @entity164			2
star : 14 - time major winner @entity68 ( centre ) has been mobbed by fans during his practice rounds @entity169 aims to roar once more ‘ it might not have been the finish i wanted but i left knowing i had the skillset to win an @entity25 , ’ said the gentle @entity170			1
‘ i had a chance to win last year as well and it makes you hungrier than ever to get the job done			0
‘ i am playing some of the best golf of my career so i should be taking advantage and giving myself a good chance			2
’ @entity29 has been here for a week already , developing a familiarity with the course under different breezes			2
‘ i just enjoy coming early , it ’s one of my favourite tournaments , ’ he said			0
under the radar : world number one @entity29 is looking to win his first @entity190 having come close in 2012 @entity191 aiming for prizes not points ‘ last week i got to play an open championship course when it was closed to everyone else			2
it ’s a real perk of the job			0
’ born a fortnight apart in 1980 , @entity97 and @entity29 will surely add to their total of one major apiece in the future			2
‘ this is our time , ’ is the mantra that binds these great friends tight			0
here at @entity146 , in the form of their lives , there is no time like the next four days			2
familiar foes : @entity29 ( right ) lost to @entity164 ( left ) in 2012 after leading by four shots with four holes to play			2

@entity68 , @entity19 and @entity21 ready to lead the stellar names charge at @entity9
@entity23 , @entity29 and @entity34 all in good form
the @entity25 begins on thursday at @entity5
