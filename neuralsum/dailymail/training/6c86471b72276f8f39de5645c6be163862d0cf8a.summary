by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 10:25 est , 8 march 2013 the parents of a toddler who was ' sent home to die ' have spoken of their outrage after the @entity5 refused to strike off the doctor who treated him			1
the health watchdog was today accused of having ' blood on its hands ' after it allowed emergency out - of - hours gp @entity11 to continue working			1
@entity14 was 19 months old when he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering inflammation of the colon in may 2011			1
tragic : @entity14 died of acute dehydration and kidney failure			1
his parents say the last doctor to treat him , out - of - hours gp @entity11 , ' effectively killed ' their son doctors sent him home three times in three days even though he showed clear signs of dehydration			1
the last person to treat @entity14 was dr @entity11 , who told his parents @entity29 , 30 , and @entity30 , 45 , their ' lifeless and unresponsive ' son had a virus			1
he advised them to go home and feed him rice and yogurt			0
two days later , @entity14 died in his sleep			2
an inquest last april condemned his treatment and said he died needlessly due to a series of failures and ' catastrophic ' errors by medical staff			0
and last week , a @entity5 investigation ruled dr @entity11 's conduct did not meet the standards required of a doctor and risked bringing the profession into disrepute			1
it also found that his standard of care fell ' below the expected level of a competent gp ' and concluded there had been ' a significant departure from good medical practice '			1
but despite the findings the @entity5 decided that @entity11 , @entity11 's actions did not fall seriously below the expected levels or care			2
they issued him with a formal warning - but did not suspended his licence or strike him off and allowed him to carry on practising as a doctor			0
missed opportunities : doctors sent @entity14 home three times in three days - even though he showed clear signs of dehydration angry : his parents @entity71 and @entity29 said the @entity5 has ' blood on its hands ' after allowing dr @entity11 to continue working @entity14 's mother branded the decision ' a disgrace ' and accused dr. @entity11 of ' effectively killing ' her son			1
mrs @entity78 , a bank worker , from @entity79 , @entity80 , said : ' i am beyond furious - the @entity5 have blood on their hands			0
' there were others responsible for @entity14 's death but effectively he has killed him			1
' his actions have lead to his death and the fact he has been allowed to carry on treating patients is disgraceful			0
' since the day @entity14 died he has been allowed to continue working as a gp			1
he has never apologised to us			0
' mrs @entity78 , who also has a seven - month - old daughter , @entity93 , said : ' we essentially took him in lifeless and unresponsive and the his attitude was to send him home to eat some rice and yoghurt			2
he did n't seem bothered at all - his attitude stank			0
' we have to relive this whole nightmare on a daily basis knowing nobody has been held accountable			0
he should have been struck off			0
' he 's been reported to the @entity5 before and it 's taken for somebody to die before any action is taken			0
dr @entity11 advised mrs @entity78 ( pictured with daughter @entity93 ) that @entity14 had a virus , and advised her to feed him rice and water			2
he died two days later the toddler had already been admitted to @entity108 twice in the previous six days , as he was so unwell ' but despite this and a two year investigation which found he had failed to examine @entity112 properly - this doctor can carry on treating patients			2
he has shown no remorse whatsoever			0
' we took this action because we did n't want any other families to go through the heartbreak that we did			0
' but now he has been allowed to keep his license - who is to say this could n't happen again ? ' the investigation also found an elderly patient had complained about dr @entity11 18 months before @entity14 's death			1
@entity125 , 67 , of @entity126 , @entity80 said he misdiagnosed a blood clot on her lung as an ear infection but no action was taken against him by the @entity5			0
dr @entity11 could not be contacted for comment today .			2
