' @entity26 awakening : the @entity1 thread asked users to spill the beans on what ' surprised ' them the most when they started living with their spouses one user described the process of ' ordering ' a bride from @entity8 or the @entity9 , where thousands of women are desperate to start a new life for themselves in @entity37 and the @entity38			1

' when a man becomes serious about a few women , he will want to purchase the girl ’s address to send letters and gifts			0
' addresses usually will cost between $ 10 [ £ 6.50 ] and $ 15 [ £ 9.80 }			1
a translator will also be needed for these letters which will normally add another $ 10 to $ 15 a letter			2
' several people submitted stories not about themselves but people they know , and almost all of them noted that the men ordered their brides because they struggled socially			1
booming : @entity69 ( pictured ) now boasts an online community of more than one million hopefuls face value : once a man has zeroed in on a woman he likes , he generally needs to hire a translator to communicate with her ' my father brought my mum at an auction in @entity83 a long time ago , it 's pretty weird and he was kinda a creepy guy so basically what you 'd expect , ' one stated			2
' i mean there 's a reason these kinds of guys end up getting mail - ordered brides			1

several men , who had presumably since split with their mail - order brides , noted that the sexual chemistry was lacking			1
' she would cook , clean , offer sex , whatever , ' one wrote			0
' pretty much what you want from your wife			0
but the passion , emotion , warmth , everything that makes a marriage actually work was lacking			0
' you could liken it to a gold digger but it was much worse			0
at least with a gold digger it is n’t painfully obvious , and you might actually convince yourself she likes some aspect of you			0
' another found the opposite			0
' the only thing i can think of is that she is very open about sexuality compared to most girls , ' wrote one man , a 35 - year - old who said he had cerebral palsy , and spent $ 22,000 [ £ 14,395 ] to secure his bride			1

' but then added : ' the biggest surprise was finding out that when his " wife " was sending money " back home to her family " , it was to her husband ( not " ex " ) and kids in the @entity9			0
' amid all the stories about disappointed grooms , there were a few sad accounts regarding the brides			2
one user wrote of a friend 's mail - order wife : ' [ @entity16 ] had a ridiculous amount of humidifiers in the home so that it could be more like where she came from			1
all she did was to sit in a chair staring at the wall looking very depressed			0
' another commented : ' there 's way too many cases in which those girls looking for a better life end up in bad stories of domestic abuse and even murder when those guys start realizing that the girls are way out of their league and they start to meet new people and making friends			0
