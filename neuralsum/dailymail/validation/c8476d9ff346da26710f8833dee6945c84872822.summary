from their heavy build and short limbs , to the shape of their skull and teeth , there are many ways that the anatomy of @entity10 differed to our own			1
now experts say that even a small bone in their ears are dissimilar to one in modern humans , raising the prospect that our extinct ancient relatives heard differently to us too			2
researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a @entity10 child , whose remains were discovered in @entity24 40 years ago			1
researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a @entity10 child , whose remains were discovered in @entity24 40 years ago to make the discovery			1
the entirety of the auditory ossicle is shown the remains from a two - year - old child , which are known as @entity33 8 , were discovered at @entity33 in the @entity34 , south western @entity24 , between 1970 and 1973			1
excavations at the rock shelter in south west @entity24 began in the early 20th century			2
they yielded the remains of female and male adults to provide scientists with the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in @entity10 , according to the @entity43			1
a total of eight individuals at all stages of life were purposefully buried at the site , including children and two foetuses			0
the skull of @entity52 is the most complete @entity10 skull ever found and includes traits such as the low , sloping forehead and large nostrils			1
the site yielded seven @entity10 skeletons ranging from foetuses to almost complete skeletons of adults , thought to be between 70,000 and 50,000 years old			2
over 40 years on , they are shedding new light on the anatomy of the extinct species , which inhabited @entity64 and parts of western @entity66 between 230,000 and 28,000 years ago			0
@entity67 , an @entity68 researcher at the @entity69 in northern @entity70 , produced a @entity72 computer reconstruction of the remains			1
his work , published in @entity75 , reveals another anatomical difference between the @entity10 and modern humans in the smallest ossicles of the body			1
among @entity33 8 ’s bones – including a skull , jaw , vertebrae , ribs and hand phalanges – is a very complete left temporal bone with an auditory ossicle inside – a complete stapes			1
neanderthals inhabited @entity64 and parts of western @entity66 between 230,000 and 28,000 years ago			0
a stock image is shown			0
the bone comes from a two - year - old of the extinct species the @entity33 site ( marked on the map ) yielded seven @entity10 skeletons ranging from foetuses to almost complete skeletons of adults the bone , which lies in the middle ear of humans and other mammals is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear			1
it is the most complete example in the @entity10 record			2
dr @entity67 made a computer model so he could virtually ‘ extract ’ the bone to study its shape closely			1
he found that the shape of the @entity10 stapes differs from our own , meaning they may have heard sounds differently too			1
he explained : ‘ we do not yet know the relation between these morphological differences and hearing in the @entity10			1
‘ this would constitute a new challenge for the future ’			0
female @entity10 did the household chores as well as hunting alongside males ( illustrated ) , according to a study which analysed their teeth female neanderthals did the household chores as well as hunting alongside males , according to a recent study which analysed their teeth			2
it suggests that women in the group were responsible for looking after furs and adjusting garments , while men had the task of improving stone tools			0
scientists at @entity137 ( @entity137 ) in @entity138 analysed 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 @entity10 found at sites in @entity70 , @entity24 and @entity142			1
the fossils in @entity70 dated back 100,000 years , in @entity24 50,000 years , and in @entity142 the ancient teeth were believed to be 44,000 years old			2
regardless of age , @entity10 had dental grooves			2
' this is due to the custom of these societies to use the mouth as a third hand , as in some current populations , for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat , for instance , ' said @entity157 , @entity137 researcher			0
but the study found grooves present in the female fossils followed the same pattern , and were different to those found in male individuals			0
' what we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men , ' said professor @entity157			0
' therefore we assume that the tasks performed were different '			0
the tiny nicks of the teeth enamel were also analysed			0
male individuals show a greater number of nicks in the enamel and dentin of the upper parts , while in female individuals these imperfections appear in the lower parts			0
it is still unclear which activities corresponded to women and which ones to men			0
however , the authors of the study note that , as in modern hunter - gatherer societies , women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of garments			0
researchers state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task .			0

bone was found among remains of a two - year - old @entity10 child
skeleton was among seven found in @entity33 , @entity24 , in the 1970s
@entity69 expert made a model of an ear bone
shows a morphological difference between @entity10 and humans
