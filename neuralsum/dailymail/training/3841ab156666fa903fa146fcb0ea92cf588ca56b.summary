when it comes to the @entity2 , no job is too big or too small			1
from catching crooks to cats stuck up trees , @entity2 can handle it all - usually			1
one cat - capturing - cop responding to a 911 call found himself needing the emergency services too			1
here kitty kitty : the stray cat was stuck up a tree in @entity14 , @entity15 when a passing police officer decided to help out after school drama : the double cat and cop rescue took place after school outside @entity22 213 in @entity14 , @entity15 the officer was trying to rescue a stray that had become stranded in a tree in @entity26 , @entity14			1
after climbing one branch too many , he ended up having to make his own 911 call , this time to the fire department			0
the officer found himself stuck up the same tree as the cat , just a little further down			1
the cop was trying to rescue the kitty across the street from @entity22 213			1
@entity15 's @entity36 : there are huge rivalries between @entity15 's fire and police departments			1
no doubt the cop involved here will be the butt of jokes for weeks to come ... @entity45 : the @entity47 slogan for the work that it does whether it be capturing criminals or cute kittys children at the school made their wishes known to the officer , ' you got ta get the cat ! you got ta get the cat ! ' they begged			2
' the cop went up after the cat			2
the cat went a little further out			2
so , the cop went further out and he got stuck			0
' said a source at the @entity2			2
leave it to @entity36 who arrived with the tools that this job needed from the get - go			2
an @entity36 tower ladder and bucket arrived to scoop up the cop and cat 30 feet up the tree and brought them both back down to earth , without so much as a scratch			1
the black and white cat appeared to be about a year old and was not wearing a collar , according to neighbour @entity77 , 19			0
another neighbour @entity78 , 22 , said students from the nearby school had just finished classes for the day and stopped to stare at the police officer and the cat			0
' it was kind of comical , ' he said			0
' they seemed to be enjoying themselves			0
there were no rude comments or anything			0
' the officer had lit a flare and set up cones on the ground underneath the tree before going up but onlookers ignored them as they gathered and gawked from the ground , said @entity78			0
no doubt the officer involved will be preparing to face some ribbing from his colleagues back at the station house - perhaps a job at ' special branch ' awaits ?			0
