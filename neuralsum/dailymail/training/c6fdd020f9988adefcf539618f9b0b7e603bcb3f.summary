it is bitterly frustrating that @entity1 are heading into another major tournament with an unsettled team and a squad beset by injuries			1
this has been going on for years , with @entity1 seemingly suffering a disproportionately high number of injuries compared with other major rugby nations			1
the question has to be asked : why ? is this bad luck or is there something at the root of the problem ? i believe it is the latter			1
@entity18 ( far left ) suffered a knee injury after falling awkwardly following a tackle from @entity21 @entity22 became the latest player to join @entity25 ’s lengthy casualty list @entity1 coach @entity25 is contending with a long injury list due to the amount of rugby being played there is no doubt player welfare and release periods before internationals have vastly improved compared with when i was coaching @entity1			1
but the game has also changed dramatically and players are suffering			2
differences in professional opinion between myself and senior medical people at the @entity40 over players playing when not 100 per cent fit - or needing a rest - was at the forefront of why i resigned , just months after winning the 2003 @entity45			1
more than a decade on , nothing has changed and i still hold this firm view - that , if there ’s any doubt over fitness , the @entity1 coach should have the final say on when @entity1 players play for their clubs			1
injury victim @entity55 ( left ) and @entity56 spoke at @entity57 as @entity1 trained on tuesday @entity58 ( left ) ad @entity59 will have to field an @entity1 side that has been patched up somewhat unfortunately , there were @entity40 people who were prepared to accept a compromise where - at best - the @entity1 doctor would liaise with the club doctor over when players played			1
looks fine on paper , but the game had changed			0
it was never going to work			0
it has resulted in the current situation where in every tournament @entity1 ’s squad is decimated by injuries			1
professional sport , especially rugby , is a brutal business and you just do not win by compromising over areas like this			0
this started in 1995 - 96 when the sport turned professional			0
the @entity40 had the opportunity to sign the best players on central contracts - it ’s what the southern hemisphere unions did and what the @entity88 and @entity89 have done			2
instead of acting decisively , the @entity40 allowed clubs to sign players and the opportunity was lost			2
@entity93 ( right ) is still not fully fit as he recovers from a shoulder injury @entity18 ( left ) and @entity55 will miss @entity1 's opening @entity96 match owing to injury i have no problem with club owners or directors of rugby wanting their players to play for their clubs			1
people like @entity106 at @entity107 , the @entity109 family at @entity110 and @entity111 at @entity112 have pumped vast amounts of personal wealth into the professional game and in many ways are the heroes of the sport , the men who have moved it into the modern era			0
club rugby is still so important			0
i ’m also not doubting the integrity of club doctors			0
they are not sending players out to get injured			0
having injured players is not in their interests			0
but are @entity1 and the clubs working together effectively enough to give our players the best chance of staying fit and healthy ? i ’d say not			1
@entity133 captain @entity132 ( left ) is in great form for his club and will comfortably slot in at blindside flanker despite losing @entity18 through injury @entity139 10 @entity138 was already a favourite to start at the moment there ’s ‘ @entity1 time ’ and ‘ club time ’			2
the players desperately want to play for @entity1 , it is the pinnacle of the game and they ’ll do anything to nail down their place , especially in a @entity45 year			1
equally though , they are loyal to their clubs and love playing for them , especially in @entity153			2
but players are under pressure from both sides			0
once they arrive in @entity1 camp , they are aware these chances do not come round often			2
then , when they return to their clubs , it ’s time to get to work again and they are eager to contribute			0
within this tug of war , the medical teams for club and country are under huge pressure to deliver players for selection			0
my concern is that there ’s too much emphasis , in both set - ups , to keep players going , week in , week out			2
@entity178 's @entity177 has an ankle injury which will rule him out of @entity1 's clash with @entity181 @entity55 walks away during his return to club side saracens last weekend in a 33 - 10 victory over @entity185 although players may ‘ technically ’ pass a fitness test , how often are they still rested to avoid any chance of further injury ? or rested to ensure they ’re available for an @entity1 camp - especially in a @entity45 year ? we ’ve seen with some of the recent stories on concussion in rugby in @entity198 ’s sister paper , the @entity199 , players do not always feel able to speak up about questionable practices			1
but it ’s vital players are allowed to speak out if they feel they are being asked to play when they are injured			2
players like @entity205 and @entity206 have been brave on this front and i ’d like to see current players do the same			0
with the best will in the world , this tough game will cause injuries			0
as @entity1 coach , you want your top players in big club games , just as long as they are fit			1
@entity181 captain @entity218 ( left ) and @entity1 skipper @entity219 ( right ) with the @entity96 trophy @entity1 head coach @entity25 is having to contend with a host of injury headaches some injuries , like @entity18 ’s , are unavoidable			1
but a lot of the injuries @entity1 ’s players are suffering are not one - off unfortunate events			1
we are seeing cumulative injuries brought about by wear and tear in one of the most physically - demanding sports			0
it is quite clear too many players are playing on with existing injuries and , in @entity45 year , that is not good enough			1
no country could suffer the number of injuries @entity1 are facing and consistently challenge the best in the world			1
part of the problem for @entity25 is that he still has n’t settled on his first - choice xv and that means none of his players know whether they should be prioritising @entity1			1
back in 2003 i was able to speak openly and frankly to the top 20 players in my squad and say , ‘ just look after yourself ’			0
@entity138 ( left ) had to undergo concussion tests after suffering a heavy blow during @entity112 's win on sunday @entity177 , a regular on @entity1 ’s blindside of the scrum under @entity58 , limped off injured on saturday i made it crystal clear that if i heard any of them were playing for their clubs with injuries , they were risking a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity and not only letting themselves down but also the team ... in fact , the whole country			1
at the moment we have only three or four players who are nailed - on starters and some of these are out of form			0
so what we have is the entire @entity1 squad out there smashing seven bells out of each other , desperate to prove their worth			0
@entity283 tight - head @entity282 has been called into @entity1 ’s training squad to replace @entity22 second row @entity285 is another player absent after injuring his knee while playing for @entity288 let ’s not forget rugby has changed beyond recognition over the past 20 years			1
it is now described as a ‘ collision ’ sport rather than a ‘ contact ’ sport and the hits players are taking are massive			0
they are warriors playing a sport vastly different to when i played the game			0
but without players there is no game and they need to be looked after better			0
that means not playing when injured and being given more time off between seasons to rest their battered bodies			0
@entity1 ’s players deserve better and so do the fans			2
the @entity96 gets under way next friday and @entity1 's squad has been devastated by injury ahead of their visit to @entity181			1
here is the lowdown on the walking wounded : backs @entity55 ( @entity319 ) : knee - doubtful for start of @entity96 @entity321 ( @entity319 ) : concussion - doubtful for start of @entity96 @entity93 ( @entity319 ) : shoulder - doubtful for start of @entity96 @entity18 ( fly - half ) : knee - out of @entity96 @entity324 ( full back ) : knee - out for season @entity327 ( @entity319 ) : groin - out for around a month forwards @entity330 ( @entity319 ) : ankle - out for around a month @entity332 ( @entity319 ) : neck - out of @entity96 @entity333 ( no 8 ) : leg - out for season @entity285 ( @entity319 ) : knee - out for 3 - 4 weeks @entity337 ( @entity319 ) : knee - out of @entity96 @entity22 ( @entity319 ) : neck - uncertain @entity177 ( flanker ) : ankle - uncertain			2

@entity1 are suffering from an injury crisis ahead of the @entity96
@entity342 seem to suffer a disproportionately high number of injuries
it is not just down to bad luck - @entity1 stars are playing too much rugby
players are turning out for their clubs when they are not fully fit
in a @entity45 year , it is *unacceptable* for @entity1 stars to play too much
