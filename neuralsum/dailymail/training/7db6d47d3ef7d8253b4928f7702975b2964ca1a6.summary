a cancer patient 's dying wish was granted recently when his discharge from the @entity3 was changed from ' undesirable ' to ' honorable ' after being kicked out in 1956 for being gay			1
since ' @entity5 ' was repealed in 2011 , an estimated 114,000 former - soldiers who were discharged from the military for homosexuality are eligible to have their records corrected			2
when 79 - year - old @entity12 was diagnosed with terminal cancer a year ago , he applied for an honorable discharge but still did n't know if he would live to see the day it was changed			1
celebrated service : @entity12 ( sitting ) was recently awarded an honorable discharge from the @entity3 at a ceremony in his apartment building			1

receiving an award ( left ) and taking books to a comrade in the hospital ( right ) that 's when activist group @entity29 stepped in			2
they got mr @entity12 @entity32 lawyer @entity31 to represent his case pro bono and the military expedited his request in just two weeks , instead of the normal six weeks to six months			1
at a recent ceremony held in his apartment building , two @entity3 in uniform came to congratulate mr @entity41 and hand him his new discharge papers			1
' i do n't have much longer to live , ' he said as he fought back tears , ' but i shall always remember it			0
' mr @entity12 was kicked out of the military when he was 22 , after three years of service			2
a fellow soldier whom mr @entity12 had spent off - duty time with had informed his commanding officer that @entity12 was gay and the officer believed it and processed the discharge			1
but the discharge did n't stop mr @entity12 from going on to have a successful career , at one point helping to construct @entity58			2
welcomed back : mr @entity12 was given a cap and the letter was read to him during the recent ceremony it did , however , keep him in the closet for many years and he still attributes his later success to hiding his sexuality			1
' i would n't be here today			0
i 'd probably be on the street , ' he told the @entity68			0
mr @entity12 finally came out to his family in 2005 when he attended a wedding with @entity71 , his partner of more than 20 years who has since passed away			2
' he 's been carrying this societal shame with him all these years , ' his niece @entity73 said			0
' we as a family had no idea the pain he had inside him			0
' @entity81 of the @entity82 was on hand for the ceremony and hopes mr @entity12 's case will lead others to get their records changed			1
movement : @entity81 of the @entity82 hopes mr @entity12 's story will inspire others to go back and change their discharges ' what happened today is that a dying man , his dignity was restored , ' mr @entity81 told @entity95			1
' he will die here knowing that he served his country honorably			0
you certainly ca n't right the wrong of six decades , [ but ] you can make it right going forward			0
and that 's what happened today , and that 's what we hope will come to thousands of @entity106 similarly situated			0
' the hundreds of thousands undesirably discharged from the military will also be eligible for benefits like @entity112 health care or home loans with an honorable discharge , but that was never the point of the change for mr @entity12 his lawyer said			2
' it was really overwhleming seeing @entity119 finally have his wrong righted , ' she said			0
' he is such a wonderful loving man , and he served with honor in the military and it was so important to him			0

a fellow soldier told @entity12 's commanding officer that he was gay and had him discharged
