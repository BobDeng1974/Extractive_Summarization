on the defence : @entity1 chief general @entity7 tells @entity14 's 60 minutes that the agency is only spying on fewer than ' 60 @entity5 persons ' as he denies claims it routinely listened into phone calls preserving their reputation : 60 minutes was granted unprecedented access to its secretive hq in a belated damage - limitation exercise in the wake of @entity21 's leaks ' @entity1 can only target the communications of a @entity5 person with a probable cause finding under specific court order , ' he said , referring to the secret @entity32			1
' today , we have less than 60 authorisations on specific persons to do that			0
' @entity7 challenged the view that the @entity1 was engaged in listening to the content of phone calls , but acknowledged that basic information of more than 300million phone records were collected			1
he said : ' there 's no reason that we would listen to the phone calls of @entity5			1
there â€™s no intelligence value in that			0
' there 's no reason that we 'd want to read their email			0
there is no intelligence value in that			0

damaging : another @entity1 chief , @entity58 ( pictured ) , told the program that @entity21 had effectively stolen the ' keys to the kingdom ' when he swiped more than 1.5 million top secret files worried : @entity58 said of particular concern was @entity21 's theft of around 31,000 documents the @entity1 official described as an ' exhaustive list of the requirements that have been levied against the @entity1 ' @entity58 , who heads the @entity1 taskforce in charge of assessing the impact of @entity21 's leaks , said the contractor possessed a ' roadmap ' of the @entity80 's strengths and weaknesses			1
he said of particular concern was @entity21 's theft of around 31,000 documents the @entity1 official described as an ' exhaustive list of the requirements that have been levied against the @entity1			1
' ' what that gives is , what topics we 're interested in , where our gaps are , ' said @entity58			0
' additional information about @entity5 capabilities and @entity5 gaps is provided as part of that			0
' the information could potentially offer a rival nation a ' roadmap of what we know , what we do n't know , and give them - implicitly - a way to protect their information from the @entity80 's view , ' the @entity1 official added			2
' it is the keys to the kingdom			0
' secretive operations : the @entity1 has made dozens of changes in its operations and computer networks to prevent the emergence of another @entity21 @entity58 said he would be open to the possibility of an amnesty for @entity21 , who remains exiled in @entity116 , if he agreed to stop further leaks of classified information			1
' my personal view is , yes , it 's worth having a conversation about ' a possible deal , said @entity58			1
@entity21 has been charged with espionage by @entity5 authorities for divulging reams of secret files			2
the former @entity1 contractor has insisted he spilled secrets to spark public debate and expose the @entity1 's far - reaching surveillance			2
but @entity7 rejected the idea of any amnesty for @entity21			1
' this is analogous to a hostage - taker taking 50 people hostage , shooting 10 and then say ' you give me full amnesty and i 'll let the other 40 go , ' @entity7 told 60 minutes			2
in all , @entity58 says @entity21 is likely to still be in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents as he waits in asylum in @entity116			1
top secret : a room known as the black chamber where the @entity1 's codebreakers operate meanwhile , the @entity1 has made dozens of changes in its operations and computer networks to prevent the emergence of another @entity21 , including potential disciplinary action , a top @entity1 official said on friday , as a @entity154 review panel recommended restraints on @entity1 spying			1
in the more than hour - long interview with @entity158 , @entity58 acknowledged the agency had done a poor job in its initial public response to revelations of vast @entity1 monitoring of phone and @entity166 data ; pledged more transparency ; and said he was deeply worried about highly classified documents not yet public that are among the 1.7 million @entity21 is believed to have accessed			1
he also stoutly defended the @entity1 's mission of tracking terrorist plots and other threats , and said its recruiting of young codebreakers , linguists and computer geeks has not been affected by the @entity21 affair - even as internal morale has been			1
' any time you trust people , there is always a chance that someone will betray you , ' he said			0
the @entity1 is taking 41 specific technical measures to control data by tagging and tracking it , to supervise agency networks with controls on activity , and to increase oversight of individuals			0
the @entity1 's hq in @entity193 , @entity194 : @entity58 said @entity21 's documents could potentially give rival nations a ' roadmap ' showing them how to protect their information from the @entity80 's view measures include requiring two - person control of every place where someone could access data and enhancing the security process that people go through and requiring more frequent screenings of systems administrative access , @entity58 said			1
after months of sometimes blistering criticism in the news media and by @entity215 and foreign governments , the publicity - averse @entity1 is now mounting an effort to tell its side of the @entity21 story			2
@entity58 , a 36 - year intelligence veteran who reportedly is in line to be the agency 's deputy director , joked that doing media interviews was ' a complete out - of - body experience for me			2
' he spoke to @entity158 on the same day that the @entity154 said it had decided to maintain the practice of having a single individual head both the @entity1 and @entity227 , which conducts cyberwarfare - an outcome the @entity1 leadership favored			0
separately , news reports late thursday said an outside review panel appointed by the @entity154 has recommended changes in a program disclosed by @entity21 that collects basic data on @entity5 ' phone calls - known as metadata			1
bargaining @entity237 : authorities say @entity21 still has 1.5 million classified documents in his possession the panel reportedly said the data should be held by an organization other than the @entity1 and stricter rules should be enforced for searching the databanks			2
@entity58 declined to discuss the panel 's specific recommendations			0
but he seemed to acknowledge that tighter guidelines for @entity1 eavesdropping were in the offing , saying that what is technologically possible ' has gotten ahead of policy			0
' @entity21 , who is living under asylum in @entity116 , disclosed a vast @entity5 eavesdropping apparatus that includes the phone metadata program ; @entity1 querying of internet communications via major companies such as @entity259 and @entity260 ; and widespread tapping of international communication networks			1
@entity58 made no apologies for what many see as overly aggressive @entity1 monitoring			2
he noted that the @entity5 government 's intelligence taskings to the agency run to 36,000 pages , and said its activities take place within a ' box ' of @entity5 laws and policies			2
' we 'll color in every square millimeter of that box , ' he said , implying the @entity1 will use its legal authorities to the fullest extent possible			0
the @entity1 's internal review has determined about 98 percent of the scope of the material that @entity21 had accessed , and officials have found no evidence that he had help either within the @entity1 or from adversary spy agencies			2
@entity58 said that when @entity21 was downloading the documents , @entity1 was ahead of other intelligence agencies in installing ' insider threat ' software that president @entity291 ordered in the wake of an earlier leak scandal involving the group @entity294			1
but installation of the software , which might have stopped @entity21 , was not complete			0
' @entity21 hit at a really opportune time			0
for him - not for us , ' he said			0
@entity58 said that most of the @entity21 material released publicly so far has been about @entity1 programs and partnerships with foreign countries and companies , rather than intelligence reports and ' requirements			1
' the latter refers to @entity5 government taskings to the @entity1 to answer questions about specific targets			0
that last category is what keeps him up at night			0
' those make me nervous because they reveal what we know and what we do n't know and they are almost a roadmap for adversaries			0
' no one at the @entity1 has yet lost their job over the @entity21 crisis , including at the @entity325 site where he worked			0
@entity58 said three people are under review for potential disciplinary action , but declined further comment .			0
