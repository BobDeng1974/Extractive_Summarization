it sat on a stark white block in a vast room that resembled a laboratory			1
i was at the @entity5 in the @entity7 borough of @entity8 , a spot dedicated to all things modern and avant garde			1
taking pride of place was a cluster of bottles , each of which contained dog fluff and a photo of the mutt it came from			1
‘ we ’re running a competition to find new talent , ’ explained the black - clad curator , brightly			2
‘ maybe i ’ll shave the cat next time i visit my parents , ’ i thought to myself			2
‘ if i stick the fluff in a bottle , it might just win			2
’ cultural revolution : @entity7 is in the throes of a cultural revolution - but @entity34 is still brilliant welcome , then , to @entity35 , a city that bears no resemblance to the version depicted in @entity39 and @entity40 and instead centres around a throbbing contemporary arts scene largely based in @entity42 and @entity8 - the latter the beneficiary of a recent gentrification programme			1
gone ( mostly ) are the rough tenements and in their place , a bustling network of shop - lined streets and some seriously classy bars and hotels			2
among the latter was the @entity54 , a stark block of a building decked out in the industrial - chic style so beloved of @entity59 hipsters			2
@entity60 , as it were			2
it was all a far cry from @entity62 where i had begun my trip , courtesy of an @entity67 wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of @entity71 and the spectacular @entity72 for up to seven days en route to @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 or , in my case , @entity7			1
although still on the global naughty step thanks to a calamitous economic meltdown in 2009 , the @entity62 capital shows signs of recovery – not least in the form of the revellers that lined the street outside the @entity87 , a gloriously @entity89 - looking place to stay , as i arrived at midnight following an evening flight from @entity59			2
the next morning , i dragged myself out of bed for a @entity93 - style cooking class at @entity94 where i learned to cook barley risotto and salt and pepper salmon – the perfect way , as it turned out , to fortify me for the dramatic scenery that came next			2
stunning : the @entity100 in @entity101 is a short hop from @entity71 @entity103 - inspiring : @entity104 is home to a row of geysers that fire boiling water and a sulphurous stench into the air covered with a thick layer of snow , @entity101 sits atop the fault line that separates the @entity115 continent from the @entity117 one and provides @entity62 with its volcanoes , geysers and geothermal springs			1
the site of @entity62 ’s first parliament , it ’s a short hop from @entity104 , where a series of geysers explode in a shower of boiling water and revolting sulphurous stench every five minutes or so			2
slipping and sliding on the ice , the first explosion caught me unawares and forced me to jump back			2
at the next one , i held my nerve , looking smugly round at the tourists who had been caught on the hop like i had been			0
then came a trip to @entity138 , a series of greenhouses filled with tomato plants and set next to a stable crammed with hairy @entity62 ponies			0
the glowing buildings were an odd sight , although the produce was second to none , but even that paled in comparison to the @entity149 – a bubbling pool flanked by a geyser and lit , on clear nights , by the shimmering green and purple glow of the @entity154			0
sitting there , watching them ripple , was truly magical			0
the next morning , it was off to @entity7 which , with its claustrophobic cluster of skyscrapers and determinedly chic inhabitants , was a very different prospect indeed			1
while @entity62 , like the rest of @entity89 , boasts an effortless flair for design and a natural cool , the @entity162 has clearly worked on it			0
beneath the too - cool - for - school surface , however , lies some old - fashioned @entity168 – not least in the all - american charm of the cheerful locals			0
looking cool : @entity172 , home to @entity173 among others , is awash with artisan bars new look : @entity8 has had a makeover , with tough neighbourhoods replaced with cool shops and chic bars among them are the staff at the @entity183 in @entity184 , who took a break from watching the @entity187 to ply me with burgers and fries as i arrived , dishevelled , following a five - hour flight from @entity71			1
the next morning , after an all - american breakfast of bacon and waffles , i left the chintzy charms of the @entity196 behind for a visit to @entity34 , the epicentre of @entity7 ’s cultural cool			1
a fabulous place set in a glass and steel building over several floors , it is crammed with modern art dating from the mid- 18th century onwards			0
@entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 are there in numbers , as are @entity211 and @entity212			0
@entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 dot its walls , as does some appalling stuff by the likes of @entity220 – avoid that and stick to the good bits on the third floor is my advice			0
carrying bags of @entity212 prints and a sunday morning sized @entity34 mug , we hopped into one of @entity7 ’s iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low - rise @entity172 , where another hipster favourite – craft beer – is taking hold			1
beneath the pub where we ate lunch was a small collection of stills , where a variety of types , including one containing raw oysters , was being brewed			0
it was all delicious and a pleasant change from the @entity244 usually found in @entity115 bars			0
@entity247 beer , artisan food and artisan art are all staples of @entity7 ’s burgeoning hipster culture , although to a cynical @entity254 like me , some of it felt a little try - hard			1
brilliant : the @entity256 is set to become a @entity7 must - visit - well worth going to a case in point is the play @entity261 , which made its début in @entity59 to critical rumblings and indifferent audiences but has become a real favourite in @entity7			1
set in a warehouse over several floors , the idea is that you walk in at an unspecified point in the play ( i managed to work out that it was a version of @entity273 but not everyone does ) and follow the actors around attempting to get a handle on the action			0
beginning in a wonderfully old - fashioned red - velvet lined bar , the action was compered by a chap with a @entity283 accent taken from the @entity285 school of acting , who showed us into a lift and provided us with @entity291 - style masks before throwing us into the thick of things			0
moving around the huge set , i walked into scene after scene and never really got much sense of the plot , although i did find myself becoming increasingly irritated with the hammy miming			0
indeed , so disjointed was @entity299 , $ 20 booklets explaining the plot were being flogged to theatregoers , who had already paid $ 80 to get in , on their way out			0
being unable to work out what it was all about is clearly a recurrent problem			0
luckily for those whose tastes do n’t stretch to baffling plays and bottles of dog fluff , @entity7 still has much to love			1
along with @entity34 , there ’s the brilliant @entity256 in @entity8 which takes you on a whistlestop tour through the @entity316 ’ lengthy cinematic history with the help of a cleverly curated selection of pieces , among them the creepy doll which found fame in the @entity324			1
then there ’s the bewildering selection of places to eat			0
in @entity8 alone , there ’s everything from @entity330 to @entity283 and everything in between - and nearly all of it is delicious			1
and of course , there are all those iconic sights : the slow - moving @entity336 , the @entity337 , the @entity338 and more			0
@entity35 might not be to everyone ’s taste but there ’s no shortage of reasons to love the @entity162 – pulsating art scene and a quirky taste in plays included			1
just do n't make me watch @entity299 again			0
