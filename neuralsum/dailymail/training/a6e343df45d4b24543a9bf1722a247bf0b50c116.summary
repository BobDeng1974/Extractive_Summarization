referees are not allowed to speak for themselves and they have n’t been since 2007 when they were instructed not to speak to the media despite the educational benefits that communication offers			0
now the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) have a credible speaker in their newly appointed technical director @entity6			2
on monday night , @entity6 was afforded an opportunity to talk us through how it feels to referee huge games and how difficult some decisions are , particularly in the biggest games			1
initially he wasted the chance to explain just how hard it is and how different it feels to referee the biggest @entity29 games by claiming that all games are treated equally			1
players will disagree and so do i. then he went on to clarify how referees view contact by one player to another ’s face , or at least above the line of the shirt as invading personal space and unacceptable when supporting the dismissal of @entity42 when playing for @entity14 against @entity43 two weeks ago			0
cue the set up and fast forward to @entity45 ’s reaction to @entity46 on saturday at the @entity47			0
the @entity18 production team left the clip frozen on @entity45 with the top of his head pushed into @entity46 ’s face with referee @entity53 looking straight at it from close up			1
the retired referee is now the technical director at @entity4 sky host @entity56 ( left ) talks to @entity19 as @entity6 and @entity20 watch on it had to be a red card from @entity6 ’s definition but instead of explaining how the enormity of the occasion , the desire to get through a massive game without a red card and inevitable controversy which led to @entity53 ’s mistaken tolerance , he chose to defend his former colleague			1
surely the right thing to say would have been that @entity53 was not afforded a slow - motion view or the freeze frame that @entity6 was left looking at			1
if he had it would have been a red card			0
the opportunity to educate and clarify was wasted			2
but here ’s the rub			0
@entity4 personnel feel duty bound to support their colleagues , their mates			0
rather than just clarify and be consistent there is a desire to ‘ cover ’ for the referee			2
clearly it is easier to criticise an assistant who missed a clear offside in the @entity87 vs @entity89 game			0
of course working in live tv is n’t easy but well within @entity6 ’s ability if his hands were not tied			2
i have huge respect for @entity6 and his refereeing cv ; i like @entity53 and think he is one of the best refs on the current list			1
however , as an independent voice i have to say that both men erred this weekend and one more understandably than the other			0
@entity102 's @entity45 was fortunate to escape a red card for this confrontation with @entity46 the @entity105 is held back by @entity106 as @entity45 squares up to him on saturday @entity46 says ' what the f * * * ' in the direction of @entity29 official @entity53 after the incident			1

@entity6 makes @entity17 appearance
@entity6 wasted chance to explain how hard it is to referee the biggest @entity29 games
retired referee felt need to defend former colleague @entity53
