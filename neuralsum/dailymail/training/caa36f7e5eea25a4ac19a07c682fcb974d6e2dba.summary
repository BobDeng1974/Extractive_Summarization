@entity1 head coach @entity0 hailed @entity3 's ' big , big potential ' after the @entity5 's late winner sealed a 2 - 1 victory against @entity7			1
@entity9 's deflected shot gave the hosts a third - minute lead , but the visitors equalised through @entity14 's superb free - kick , won by former @entity1 man @entity15 on his @entity7 debut			1
@entity14 's strike looked to have earned the @entity7 a valuable point , but @entity3 added a late twist when his placed shot from edge of the area went in off the post with two minutes remaining			1
@entity3 scores a late winner to help @entity1 secure a 2 - 1 victory over @entity7 @entity3 was recently named @entity26 for the second consecutive year it was the 22 - year - old 's eighth goal in the @entity29 this season			1
' i am happy for @entity32 , ' @entity0 said			1
' he is still young , but he has big , big potential			0

' his contribution is clear			0
i am happy because he is a very good guy , a good professional and a great player			0
' @entity0 hailed @entity3 's ' big , big potential ' after the @entity5 's goal sealed a 2 - 1 win @entity3 battles for the ball with @entity7 winger @entity42 who surges forward @entity1 , who climbed to fifth after the result , should have had a third goal in injury - time , but @entity48 's effort was wrongly ruled out for offside			1
@entity7 goalkeeper @entity50 had gone up for a corner and , as @entity1 broke with speed , @entity48 was still in his own half when the ball was played to him			1
' i think the referee and the linesman were a little bit confused about the rule , ' @entity0 said			2
' when the pass went to @entity9 , it was before he had got into the opponents ' half			0
' it was a quick action , maybe the referee was focusing on another part of the game , sometimes it happens to me			0
' it was difficult though because it was 2 - 1 and it could have decided the game			1
maybe i can be in a different mood about it now			0
' @entity7 debutant @entity15 chases @entity1 centre back @entity9 @entity73 rises highest to pip @entity7 striker @entity74 to the ball @entity0 added : ' @entity9 is upset because he does not have many opportunities to score and the action was like that of a striker			1
' it is difficult to understand why , but we are all human and we can all make mistakes			0
' @entity1 have earned 10 points this season with goals in the 88th minute or later and @entity0 believes those returns are down to his players ' fitness and never - say - die mentality			1
' our fitness is very good , ' @entity0 said			2
' the club believes that is very important - the sports science and medical staff have done a great job so far			2
' and also our mentality			0
in football you always need to believe			0
you need to be strong in your mind and you have to always believe it is possible to win the game			2
' @entity15 signed for @entity7 from @entity103 side @entity102 on a three - and - a - half - year - deal earlier this month @entity105 speaks to his new signing , who has 19 goals from 55 @entity110 caps @entity3 's decisive contribution ensured an unhappy return to @entity113 for @entity15 , who had previously scored on each of his club debuts			1
@entity15 struggled to make an impact against his former club before being substituted in the 74th minute , although the 32 - year - old could have won a penalty when he tumbled over @entity48 's planted leg in the first half			1
' he started brightly , he was sharp , ' @entity7 manager @entity105 said			2
' if he got the penalty and he scores we 're talking about a great debut			2
' the referee , though , did n't see what everybody else saw clearly			0
' he was looking for his chance and i played him a bit longer than expected			0
' he will get better and better and when he gets that first chance he will put the ball in the back of the net			0
' it was a good start and a great place for him to start playing for us			0
' @entity7 's free - kick specialist @entity14 scores his side 's opening goal at @entity113 @entity140 is powerless to stop the perfectly angled strike @entity7 remain 16th in the table , one point above 18th - placed @entity144 , who play @entity146 on sunday			1
' when the winning goal is so late , it hurts , ' @entity105 added			2
' but it is part of football , you have to be good until the last minute , not the 88th or the 89th			0
