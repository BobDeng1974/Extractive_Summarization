ms @entity6 , who is in the third year of her studies , suffers from the extremely rare mortuuequusphobia - the extreme fear of ketchup and tomato - based sauces			1
whenever i see it , i just start gagging and feel genuinely afraid for my life - my friends say i 'm condimental			1
' unsurprisingly , people tend not to understand , but to me it 's the worst thing in the entire world - it 's scarier than all the horror films rolled into one			1

@entity6 lives in fear of tomato ketchup dr @entity41 , a senior psychology lecturer at the @entity42 and author of the book ' @entity45 and @entity46 ' , said she was not at all surprised by ms @entity6 's unusual phobia			1
she said : ' i 'm not surprised , i have n't come across that particular one before but there are all sorts of weird and wonderful phobias			0
' i 'd use a programme in which you combine relaxation therapy , desensitisation and gradual exposure to the feared stimulus			0
' dr @entity41 said this involve teaching ms @entity6 the ' relaxation skills ' to cope with the anxiety she felt when exposed to ketchup , then creating a hierarchy of what scares her from least to worst - such as a picture of a tomato or a tomato bottle , or the sauce itself			1
finally , she would be gradually exposed to each of these images or products starting with the item which scared her the least			0
dr @entity41 added : ' she 'd learn to manage the stress that that produces			0
it 's like a ladder - you go up each rung at a time so she 's completely relaxed about the rung before			1
' it 's very , very effective as the client is motivated - they want to get it sorted and it can be treated very , very , successful			2
' speaking to student newspaper @entity86 , she said : ' i know it 's weird , but for me , looking at a bowl of tomato soup is like staring directly into @entity91			2
' i do n't mind brown sauce , i 'm fine with mayonnaise and soup is n't an issue for me - as long as it does n't contain tomatoes			1
' i 'm even not that bothered with whole tomatoes - it 's just when they 're all mushed up and evil that it makes me afraid			2
even baked beans are too much			0
' oddly , @entity6 has no idea where her bizarre phobia came from			1
she said : ' it 's not like i had a traumatic , tomato - related incident growing up			2
i never really liked it when i was a child , and then one day it just freaked me out and i started getting really scared of it			0
' one time i was out for a meal with a new friend and she did n't know about my fear			2
before i could stop her , she got this bottle of ketchup and dolloped it on her plate			2
' it splashed and some went on my top but even worse some went on my face			0
' i rushed home and threw the top in the bin , but i could n't throw my face away so i ended up just sitting in the shower and crying			0
i 'm more scared of @entity127 then i am of death			0
' barmaid @entity129 ( pictured ) has to sleep with the wardrobe opening away from her bed phobias can range from the unsurprising - such as the all - too - common fear of spiders - to the truly bizarre			1

@entity174 has shunned most other foods since she was three years old , despite her parents ' desperate attempts to improve their daughter 's diet			0
however , such phobias are not restricted just to the young - @entity181 , @entity183 mother - of - four @entity184 has spent the past 20 years dreading mealtimes because of her fear of metal cutlery			1
other unusual phobias to have been detailed in recent months include a fear of @entity190 , onions - and even an irrational phobia of certain noises such as chewing			1
and perhaps most remarkably , last year a man claimed to have a phobia of the @entity197 family			0
retail assistant @entity198 , from @entity199 , claims to break out in a cold sweat whenever he sees or hears the famous family and says the sight of a semi-naked @entity203 even makes him vomit with disgust			0
