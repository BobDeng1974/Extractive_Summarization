by @entity0 published : 18:34 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:28 est , 2 february 2014 fellow @entity3 on saturday debated the fallout over new allegations that gov. @entity6 made inaccurate statements about his knowledge of lane closures orchestrated by top aides as apparent political payback			1
some said the accusations could derail any hopes of @entity6 running for president in 2016 if he ca n't shake the scandal soon , while others were quick to express faith in the governor while discrediting his accuser and questioning his motives			1
a letter released friday by a lawyer for a former @entity6 loyalist who ordered the closures on the heavily traveled @entity26 said evidence exists suggesting the governor knew about the closings as they happened in september , which would contradict @entity6 's previous assertions			1
governor @entity6 will need to prove he did n't know about the lane closings if he wants to run for president the governor 's office has denied the claims by @entity37 , a former executive with the @entity38 and @entity39 who was among four people who lost their jobs in the scandal			1
reaction among top @entity3 on saturday appeared mixed , with most believing he could weather the storm but acknowledging the latest allegations hurt			0
' it 's not good for him , ' said @entity49 , a @entity3 operative who worked on former sen. @entity51 's 2012 presidential campaign and still has him as a client			0
' the longer the story goes on , the worse it gets for him			0
if this is still an issue a year from now , he 's going to have trouble pulling the trigger			0
... gov. @entity6 will have to think long and hard about running			2
' but @entity58 , a co-founder of @entity60 - based @entity59 and a staunch @entity6 supporter , expressed no such reservations			2
' i have complete faith and trust that the governor is telling the truth , and i continue to believe that he would be a superb president if he were elected in the future , ' @entity58 said			2
@entity37 , former @entity38 and @entity39 director of interstate capital projects and an ally of @entity39 governor @entity6 , said @entity6 knew about the lane closures @entity72 , a @entity73 - based @entity3 consultant , agreed that @entity6 's chances on a national stage wo n't be harmed so long as he has been honest about what he knew			1
' as long as he was telling the truth , he is fine , ' @entity72 said			0
' but if he knew about this , it brings him in directly and adds - potentially - dishonesty to the charges			0
' @entity6 , who has kept mostly to the sidelines during the run - up to this year 's @entity84 , which his state his hosting , received a smattering of boos and some cheers during a pre-game ceremony in @entity91 on saturday			1
he did n't appear affected by the crowd 's reaction during the @entity95 ceremony			2
as the new head of the @entity97 , @entity6 's priority this year is raising money for the party 's gubernatorial candidates around the country			2
@entity3 maintain that donors are staying loyal to @entity6 so far			0
' my donors are saying they believe what gov. @entity6 is saying			0
they 're giving him a lot of rope , ' said @entity110 , who leads the @entity112 's fundraising effort			0
gov. @entity6 made inaccurate statements during a news conference about the lane closures near the @entity26 , according to a letter released friday ' he 's not raising money for himself , ' @entity49 added			1
' if you 're a donor in @entity119 , you 're thinking about ( @entity121 ) @entity120 and not @entity6			0
' the head of the state legislative panel looking into the traffic jams said @entity37 's new allegations validate the skepticism committee members have expressed throughout the probe , an investigation @entity6 once referred to as the @entity124 ' obsession and some state @entity3 have called ' a witch hunt			1
' assemblyman @entity133 , a @entity134 , said he does n't know what evidence @entity37 may have but said it could be an email or document that fell beyond the date range called for in the original subpoena			1
@entity37 is among 20 people and organizations close to @entity6 who must comply with a new round of subpoenas by monday , though @entity133 said almost all the recipients have requested more time			1
when @entity37 , a former political blogger who has known @entity6 since high school , appeared before the legislative panel , he asserted his right against self - incrimination and refused to answer any questions			1
his lawyer , @entity151 , has said @entity37 would testify if granted immunity from prosecution			0
@entity37 has been identified as the person who ordered the lane closings			2
he resigned from a $ 150,000 - per - year job that he got with @entity6 's blessing because of the scandal			1
' any time you have disgruntled employees leave an operation you always wonder what 's going to happen , " @entity72 said			0
' you could see this coming			0
their lives have changed forever			0
' @entity6 will not be able to run for president in 2016 if he is proven as being dishonest			1

some *republicans* believe that if @entity6 ca n't shake the scandal soon that he wo n't be able to run for president in 2016
evidence revealed by former @entity6 loyalist @entity37 indicates @entity6 knew about the lane closures and that he lied
the governor 's office has denied the claims and some @entity6 supporters still believe that he will be able to run
