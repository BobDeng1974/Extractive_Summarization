fellow philandering president @entity32 came in third with 15 percent of the vote			2
@entity62 me yet ? : @entity0 are starting to think that @entity8 , pictured here in april , was n't that bad of a president after all , compared to @entity1 @entity37 is still the most beloved president in modern history			1
this december 1987 photo was taken while he giving a speech in @entity69 ' i believe that we will win ' : @entity1 hops on the @entity17 bandwagon to lead @entity57 employees in a soccer chant at the @entity74 of the @entity75 before yesterday afternoon 's match between the @entity0 and @entity77 @entity1 's favorability ratings were underwater in nearly every issue area @entity7 asked voters about except the environment			1

' would @entity18 have been a better fit ? more voters in hindsight say yes , ' @entity120 said in a statement			0
@entity125 friends : even young people , like the ones pictured at @entity1 's speech yesterday , say they prefer @entity37 to @entity1 @entity1 is pictured here yesterday greeting his fans at the @entity130 in @entity69 , where he gave a speech about the importance of funding transportation and infrastructure projects the @entity57 struggled to defend the president 's bad showing in the @entity7 poll when a reporter broached the subject this afternoon at press secretary @entity141 's daily briefing			1
asked if @entity1 still has ' the chops ' to call on the @entity0 people to support his crusade against @entity53 , @entity141 said , ' there 's no doubt that the president has the leadership and stature necessary to call upon the @entity0 public to rally around the kinds of ideas that are in the best interests of the country			1
' ' the president is going to continue to do that , ' he said			0
seemingly unphased by the news that @entity0 have said in every recent poll that they do n't agree with the direction in which @entity1 is taking the country , @entity141 went on to explain how the ' power ' of the president 's ' ideas ' would propel him forward , as would the ' power wielded by citizens all across this country			1
' @entity0 ' have within them , based on our system of government , the ability to bring pressure on their elected representatives to actually act in the best interests of the country , ' @entity141 said before changing topics			0
the @entity57 will find out soon enough if its instincts were correct			0
voters go to the ballot box in four months to elect a new @entity53			0
generic congressional polls taken in the last several weeks put @entity181 slightly ahead , but still within the margin of error			0
@entity117 are likely to keep the @entity57 , but the @entity184 , which is currently controlled by the president 's party , could go either way			2
even if republicans do n't win the @entity184 , but they keep the @entity57 as expected , the president 's agenda will continue to be stalled , making it difficult for him to rebuild the widespread support that ushered him into office .			0

sitting president @entity1 was cited as the worst @entity0 president out of the dozen men who have held the position dating back to 1945
former @entity46 actor @entity37 ranked first on survey - takers ' lists , followed by philandering presidents @entity36 and @entity32
