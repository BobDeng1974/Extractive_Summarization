it took 21 minutes of this game and 561 in the grander scheme of @entity5 football but , finally , @entity6 had a shot on goal			1
it trickled to @entity10 and it was neither effective nor impressive , but the point is that you ca n’t score if you do n’t shoot and it ’s not always easy to shoot if you ’re hidden in midfield			0
this was @entity6 playing up front for the first time in the @entity5 since @entity17 away on december 8			1
@entity18 will have been pleased			0
@entity19 smiles as he warms up before kick off despite being dropped to the bench against @entity21 @entity6 was played in his more favoured striking role during the defeat to @entity21 on saturday @entity24 celebrates with @entity6 after the @entity25 opened the scoring against @entity21 at the @entity27 @entity19 ? less so			1
he sat there on the bench , barely speaking but surely thinking			2
the experiment with the @entity32 has been a curious one			1
the process of recovery from the sort of knee injury that interrupted his career should not be underestimated			0
but who could have expected his time at @entity42 to have been so disappointing ? is there still patience in a striker who was once so brilliantly efficient but now has to prove he is more than damaged goods ? @entity42 's @entity19 walks off after being substituted during the @entity49 fifth round tie with @entity50 a frustrated @entity19 reacts to yet another missed chance during the game against @entity53 he can not argue that he has lacked chances			1
he started the previous three games – two in the @entity5 and against @entity50 in the @entity49 , alongside @entity6 , who scored – and did not make a dent			1
he was substituted against @entity50 after an hour			0
it ’s the latest in a line of numbers that simply do not add up for him			0
the headline figures are so well - repeated they are almost wired to the sub-conscious - a £ 6million loan fee , wages of £ 265,000			0
it is impossible for most to thrive against such vast numbers			0
but players of his calibre are supposed to			0
at the very least they do better			0
but four goals in 19 games – it is not good enough			0
and that is why he was on the bench			2
@entity19 speaks with referee @entity77 during the @entity5 match against @entity79 it will be fascinating to see what happens next			1
certainly , it looks hard to see @entity42 taking their option to sign the @entity32 permanently for £ 43.2million in the summer			1
@entity84 claim there is serious alternative interest , with or without @entity42 at the bargaining table			2
their vice-president @entity95 said this week : ‘ i am not worried for @entity19 , he is a world - class striker			1
if @entity42 decide not to take up the option at the end of the season , we have interest from other great clubs			2
’ for @entity42 , the conundrum still exists , not only of how to find form from this striker , but what to do if they ca n’t			1
@entity19 in action with @entity102 of @entity103 during the @entity49 fifth round match at @entity105 this performance was frequently poor			2
@entity6 is good enough to be versatile – a quality that rarely gets the merit it deserves			2
but he is best as a front man			0
did his place up front spark an improvement ? no. the team was poor and @entity6 was only a shade above the team ’s average			1
but where @entity19 so often darts and disappears , @entity6 still carries the aura of a threat			1
he looks for the ball , he does not hide			0
when his feet wo n’t dance , his mind does not give up			0
it was n’t worth much in this game			0
and @entity42 deserved no better			2
but whatever way @entity130 looks to solve the problems of this side , it appears increasingly unlikely that @entity19 will be the answer			1
@entity19 reacts after a missed chance during the league match between @entity42 and @entity136			1

@entity6 played up front for the first time since december 8
@entity19 again had to make do with a spot on the @entity42 bench
the @entity32 striker was an *unused* sub for the game against @entity21
@entity130 's side *succumbed* to defeat at the @entity150
