@entity0 and @entity1 are considering building a high - speed rail line thousands of kilometres from @entity4 to @entity5 that would cut the journey time from six days on the @entity7 to two			1
the project would cost more than $ 230bn ( £ 144bn ) and be over 7,000km ( 4,350 miles ) long - more than three times the world 's current longest high - speed line , from the @entity0 capital to the southern city of @entity13			1
the railway would be a powerful physical symbol of the ties that bind @entity4 and @entity5 , whose political relationship has roots dating from the @entity21 era and who often vote together on the @entity23			0
the new proposed high - speed rail line would cut journey time between @entity4 and @entity5 by four days the £ 144bn construction would mean trains would n't have to travel through @entity29 capital @entity30 there are various routes along the @entity7 that link @entity1 with the @entity33 they have strengthened their relationship as @entity37 criticism of @entity1 president @entity38 mounts over @entity39 and other issues			1
the two signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this week during premier @entity47 's visit to @entity4 in which @entity5 expressed interest in building a fast rail link between the @entity1 capital and @entity51 in the oil - rich @entity53 region , state broadcaster @entity41 reported			1
the 803 - kilometre line would be the first stage of the route to @entity5 , @entity41 said			1
at present , trains between the two run along the @entity7 that links @entity4 and @entity59 , before switching to a branch line heading south through the @entity29 capital @entity30			2
the trans - siberian route connects @entity4 with @entity5 - but takes at least six days to travel as well as cutting journey time between @entity4 and @entity5 , the service would miss out remote locations the current @entity65 takes six days between @entity5 and @entity4 relations between @entity0 and @entity1 are strong , so a new rail link is very much a possibility direct passenger trains between @entity5 and @entity4 went into operation in 1954 and there are still two services per week , @entity41 said			1
the new link would cut the train travel time from six days at present to under two days , the @entity73 quoted @entity76 , a tunnel and railway expert at the @entity79 , as saying			1
' if the funds are raised smoothly ... the line can be completed in five years at the quickest , ' he added			2
the paper cited a research report that put the cost of one kilometre of @entity0 - built fast rail at $ 33 million			1
in two days passengers will be able to take on board a whole new culture direct passenger trains between @entity4 and @entity5 went into service in 1954 the new rail link symbolise the unity between @entity1 and @entity0 ( @entity91 is @entity1 president @entity38 and @entity0 premier @entity47 ) the country has the world 's largest high - speed rail network , built from scratch in less than a decade , relying on technology transfer from foreign companies , including @entity100 's @entity99 , @entity102 's @entity101 and @entity104 's @entity103			1
its reputation was tarnished after a bullet train collision in july 2011 near the eastern city of @entity109 that killed at least 40 people and injured hundreds			0
but @entity0 is now keen to promote the export of its technology , and has been building high - speed rail networks in @entity115 and @entity116			1
the @entity118 route is an important one for trade as well as commercial there is no train which is named the @entity7			0
the @entity4 - @entity59 route is served by the @entity7 , whereas @entity4 - @entity5 routes are usually achieved by using a combination of sectors on different trains			2
all of the routes are working trains and travellers journey with locals , according to trans - siberian.co.uk			2
at 9,216km ( @entity4 - @entity59 ) it is the longest direct rail route in the world , and entirely within @entity1			2
the @entity4 - @entity5 route is shorter , at 9,001km			0
the original @entity7 was built from @entity4 to @entity59 on the orders of @entity138 despite the appeal of following the original route , in practice most people are dissuaded from @entity59 by three factors : poor availability of onward connections to @entity146 or return flights to @entity148 ; the greater tourism possibilities of @entity5 ( pop 15m ) compared to @entity59 ( pop 600,000 ) ; missing the chance to visit @entity29 en - route			0
the route more favoured today is from @entity4 to @entity5 on the historic @entity155 route and takes a week			0
the alternative @entity7 - @entity29 route via @entity30 to @entity5 saves 16 hours ( and 1,136km )			0
the route to @entity59 was built between 1891 and 1916			0
the ' first rivet ' was ceremonially hammered home by the future @entity159 , the last @entity160			0
under @entity162 rule he would later be taken to @entity163 as a prisoner on board the @entity7			0
the journey spans eight time zones			2
the @entity7 is longer than the @entity168 and @entity170 @entity169			0
since @entity1 and @entity29 use broad gauge railways while @entity0 uses the standard gauge , there is a break - of - gauge , meaning that carriages to or from @entity0 can not simply cross the border , and each carriage has to be lifted in turn to have its bogies changed			1
the whole operation , combined with passport and customs control , can take several hours .			0

current journey time on @entity185 takes six days
new plans will see journey cut to take only two days
@entity190 would show the strong bond that exists between the two countries
*distance* of line thought to be around 803 kilometres
@entity0 has the largest high - speed rail network
