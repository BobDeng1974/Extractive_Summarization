@entity0 is determined to claim a place in @entity2 next year after being given the perfect opportunity by @entity4 to prove himself worthy			1
for the first time the @entity7 - based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in friday 's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends			1
ordinarily in the past , @entity4 ' reserve has been nothing more than a spare part , stood on the sidelines whilst the race drivers completed their tasks			2
@entity0 will drive in every friday practice session for @entity4 this season this year , however , @entity4 have decided @entity0 will get a shot , and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too			1
every friday @entity0 will be behind the wheel - as was the case in @entity27 last week and again in @entity28 this week - his run - plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces			1
in @entity27 , @entity0 was only 0.6secs behind @entity33 at the end of @entity35 , a tremendous effort given it was @entity0 's first major outing at an @entity2 event			1
if @entity0 can continue to push , or even on occasion better the times of @entity33 and team - mate @entity41 , doors may open			1
' i want to be really pushing the race drivers			0
that 's the aim , ' said @entity0			2
' i 'm pretty much running on the same run plan as those guys			0
it 's not like we 've seen in @entity35 sessions before with other drivers where they have been on quali settings , engine turned up or low fuel			0
' this year there 's a direct comparison and i want to show why i should be racing next year			0
' unfortunately for last year 's @entity58 champion , his lack of competitive work outside of his duties with @entity4 may prove a hindrance			2
@entity0 drives during practice for the @entity64 last weekend the 24 - year - old from @entity66 would love to be keeping his hand in , but knows it is something he has to sacrifice to keep his @entity2 dream alive			1
' i want to race , but only if i get the right offer , ' added @entity0 , son of former @entity2 driver @entity71			2
' if i get a good offer to do something that would be a good career move for me then i 'd like to race			0
' it 's about keeping sharp			0
it 's the one thing i 'm missing this year			0
' i 'm loving working with @entity4 and being in @entity2 , but i 'd love to be racing as well , so if i get a good offer i 'd love to			2
' @entity0 , though , is not actively seeking further employment because of his commitment to @entity4 , adding : ' my main focus is all here and i 'm really busy anyway			1
' if something came my way then i would definitely consider it , but my main priority is @entity4 and i will not compromise anything i do here by racing elsewhere			0
' but if there is something that came along that could fit in with this then i 'd be happy to do it			0

@entity0 will drive in every friday practice session for @entity4
the bit is determined to seize his chance with the team
in @entity27 , he was only 0.6 seconds behind pastor @entity33
