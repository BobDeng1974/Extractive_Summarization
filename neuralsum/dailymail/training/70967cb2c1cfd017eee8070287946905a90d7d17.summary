by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:46 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 11 october 2013 firefighters in @entity3 and @entity4 are to stage a fresh strike in their bitter row with the government over pensions			1
members of the @entity10 will walk out for five hours on the night of october 19 in opposition to plans to force them to work longer			1
they argue firefighters can not be expected to continue answering 999 calls ' in their late 50s and into their 60s ' but ministers said the latest industrial action was ' unconstructive and unnecessary '			1
strike : firefighters will walk out for five hours next weekend in protest at changes to their pensions the @entity10 said members will walk out for five hours from from 6.30pm on saturday october 19			1
it follows a similar stoppage last month as the stand - off with the government escalates			2
@entity10 general secretary @entity27 said : ‘ we had hoped our first strike was enough to show @entity7 that firefighters could not be more serious about protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions			1
‘ no firefighter wants to strike , and it 's desperately disappointing that governments in @entity36 and @entity37 continue to deny reality over pensions costs and the need for a pension scheme that reflects the job firefighters do			2
age : @entity10 general secretary @entity27 said firefighters can not be expected to fight fires in their 50s and 60s ‘ firefighters simply can not be expected to fight fires and rescue families in their late 50s and into their 60s			1
‘ we hope this second strike will mean both governments will be willing to discuss the full range of concerns that firefighters and the general public have expressed			2
‘ however , more strikes can not be ruled out if that 's what it takes to protect public and firefighter safety from these ludicrous attacks			2
’ firefighters in @entity66 will not be taking industrial action following an offer on pensions from the @entity7 which the union said was enough to prevent a strike ‘ at the current time ’			1
the @entity10 argues that changes to pensions and the retirement age will see thousands of firefighters lose their job ‘ simply for getting older ’			1
the union also maintains that firemen and women pay some of the highest pension contributions in the @entity82 at almost 13 per cent of their salary , with further rises due next year			0
but the government accused the @entity10 of a rush to strike action instead of seeking a resolution to the dispute			1
fire minister @entity90 said the decision to announce another strike date is ' totally unconstructive and unnecessary '			1
he added : ' the fbu themselves have said that this dispute can only be resolved through dialogue , discussion and negotiation			0
' the firefighters ' pension scheme is one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector			0
' a firefighter who earns £ 29,000 , and retires after a full career aged 60 , will get a £ 19,000 a year pension , rising to £ 26,000 with the state pension , the government says			0
an equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much			0
mr @entity90 added : ' the firefighter pension age of 60 was introduced in 2006 and matches the police and armed forces			0
' any early ill - health retirements will see an unreduced pension			0
firefighter fitness is decided by local fire and rescue authorities so the union needs to work with them to resolve that issue			0
' we have informed the @entity10 that we will support that process with the conciliation service acas as required			1
' row : the latest walkout against government cuts ' is totally unconstructive and unnecessary ' , the government said fire chiefs moved to reassure the public that safety would not be put at risk			1
london fire commissioner @entity132 said : ‘ we are as prepared as ever to deal with this next round of strike action			2
it 's a shame that further action is being taken , but our contingency plan will kick in and we will be ready to deal with emergencies			2
‘ there will be 27 fire engines based at strategic points across @entity142 , ready to provide an emergency back - up fire service			0
they wo n't deal with minor incidents like bin fires or automatic fire alarms , but will attend serious emergencies like large fires and road traffic accidents			0
‘ once again , our advice is to take extra care to prevent fires at home			0
simple steps like ensuring your hob is switched off and cigarettes are properly extinguished can make all the difference			0
