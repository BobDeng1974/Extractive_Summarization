by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:27 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 22 october 2012 newsman : @entity3 , who has been at @entity4 since 1972 , will be the moderator during tonight 's debate in @entity6 , @entity7 the moderator in the third and final round of the debate slugfest between @entity11 and @entity12 may have a wealth of @entity15 charm , but do n't expect him to be soft with the candidates			1
millions of voters will be glued to the tube on monday night for the last presidential debate , and many are wondering if longtime @entity4 newsman @entity3 will steal the show as his fellow moderators have - for negative reasons			1
at 75 , @entity3 is only three years younger than @entity25 ’s @entity24 , who came under intense criticism for how he handled the first debate between @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity3 ’s career goes back to 1972 , when he became anchor of the @entity4 sunday night news			1
today , he remains the moderator of the network ’s sunday talk show @entity32			1
he is also the network 's chief @entity34 correspondent			1
it 's also not his first foray in the debate scene , as @entity3 was at the helm for the 2004 debate between president @entity41 and @entity42 , and in the 2008 event between president @entity11 and @entity44			1
on the debate agenda are @entity48 - @entity47 tensions , @entity49 , terrorism and the war in @entity52 - all subjects expected to come up monday in the 90 - minute encounter			2
although polls show the economy is of top concern to most voters , global affairs have cropped up as a key issue in the final weeks due to unrest in @entity62 , @entity63 and elsewhere			2
thanks to a bitter campaign rivalry , thriving partisan media outlets and the growth of social media , debate moderator is approaching baseball umpire on the scale of thankless jobs			1
@entity24 was criticized for not doing enough and @entity73 ’s @entity72 was ripped for doing too much			0
setting the stage : a worker adjusts the backdrop on stage in preparation for monday 's presidential debate between @entity11 and @entity12 the big stage : @entity82 students serve as stand - ins during final preparations for the debate one last debate : @entity12 and @entity11 , pictured during last week 's debate at @entity88 , will get together for the third and final time before @entity89 ' there are millions of people with their hands over their keyboards ready to analyze every single moment of what 's happening , ' said veteran tv journalist @entity96			1
' that puts even more pressure on ... it 's a no - win situation			2
' conservative columnist @entity100 called last week 's get - together at @entity88 on @entity102 the best presidential debate he 's ever seen			1
it did n't take long , however , for @entity106 @entity12 's supporters to go after @entity72			2
they said questions that she chose from undecided voters on immigration , gun control and equal pay for women played to president @entity11 's strengths			1
they were incensed when @entity72 , faced by two candidates in a dispute over what was said during a presidential address about @entity62 , corrected @entity12 by saying @entity11 had referred to an attack on @entity121 in @entity122 as an ' act of terror			1
' @entity72 also noted that others in the administration suggested for nearly two weeks that the reaction to an @entity129 video was a motivating factor in the attack			0
been here before : @entity3 moderated a 2008 debate between @entity11 and @entity44 experience : chieffer , center , also moderated a 2004 debate between then - president @entity41 and @entity136 challenger @entity42 radio host @entity137 called @entity72 's work ' an act of journalistic terror			1
' ' if there were any journalistic standards , what she did last night would have been the equivalent of blowing up her career like a suicide bomber , ' he said			0
the conservative @entity150 criticized @entity72 for having only one question on a foreign policy issue , even though this monday 's @entity3 - moderated debate is supposed to focus on foreign policy			1
thanks to a clock that airs on @entity73 's screen during the debate , some conservatives saw as a sign of bias that @entity11 spoke for 44 minutes , 4 seconds during the debate , compared to @entity12 's 40:50			1
this prompted @entity73 to count the actual words spoken by each candidate			0
the faster - talking @entity12 said 7,984 words and @entity11 7,506			2
criticism of @entity72 was a relentless post-debate topic on @entity169 , which knows @entity73 is n't popular among republicans in its audience			0
@entity172 : @entity3 , pictured left , chats with president @entity174 in the @entity175 conservatives on @entity169 and liberals on @entity178 offer an echo chamber for partisan complaints and have far greater prominence than they had even a decade ago			2
' i knew from the start , ' @entity72 told @entity1 , ' somebody is going to be unhappy no matter what you do			0
' @entity72 's bosses leapt to her defense : ' she had to deal with the tricky format , the nervous questioners , the aggressive debaters , all while shutting out the pre-debate attempts to spin and intimidate her , ' @entity73 @entity121 chief @entity187 said in a memo to staff			2
' she pulled it off masterfully			0
' even as each debate progresses , @entity198 is crackling with reactions			0
type in the moderator 's name in a search and the screen immediately fills with tweets			2
generally , it 's a dependable way to gauge how a candidate is doing			0
the harsher one party 's reaction to a moderator is , the tougher time their candidate is having onstage			2
' i 've never known the winning side to [ complain ] , ' said @entity214 , the former @entity215 and @entity73 anchor who is now a professor at @entity217			0
@entity24 was likened to a teacher who had lost control of the class during his debate			0
frustration against @entity24 boiled over predominantly among @entity136 like @entity223 and @entity224 who were witnessing @entity11 's admittedly poor performance in the first debate			1
the former @entity25 host said he essentially tried to get out of the way , asking general questions and letting the candidates go after each other			0
' i wondered if we needed a moderator since we had @entity12 , ' @entity11 's deputy campaign manager @entity232 said , even though her candidate talked longer			1
as in the second debate , @entity12 spoke more words			0
' hey , i was n't that bad ' : @entity24 , another journalism industry veteran , came under intense criticism for the way he he handled the first debate between @entity11 and @entity12 show of support : moderator @entity72 had the backing of @entity73 despite what her critics said one motive of the pre- and post-debate criticism is to ' work the refs , ' to let the moderators know that partisans are watching			1
if intimidation works , even on a subtle level , it can seep into their performances at a time when even modest advantages can make a big difference			0
during the second debate , @entity261 went so far as to count how many times each candidate and @entity72 interrupted one another			0
they found that @entity12 was interrupted 58 times and @entity11 43			2
the numbers came with little context , however , so it was n't clear how many interruptions were related to candidates exceeding agreed - upon time limits			0
leading the discussion : @entity3 has been at @entity4 since 1972 , and is the current moderator at the network 's sunday talk show @entity32 @entity72 's role in the @entity62 discussion also raised the issue of how much the moderators should be prepared to practice journalism while onstage			1
if you hear something factually incorrect or misleading , is it your duty to point it out to viewers , or is that strictly the candidates ' job ? for most viewers , the answer no doubt has to do with which candidate is being @entity290 let 's get this moderator 's job straight : craft sharp questions to get the candidates to talk , while being meticulously fair not to challenge one more than another			1
keep an eye on the clock so one candidate does n't get to hog the time			0
do n't be bullied ; be firm in forcing the candidates to move on			0
but be flexible enough to keep a productive discussion flowing			0
keep the focus off yourself			0
and do it all on live television before some 60 million people .			0

@entity3 has been with @entity4 since 1972 , and is the current moderator of the network 's sunday talk show @entity32
