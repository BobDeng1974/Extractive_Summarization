migrants will be banned from receiving any benefits until they have contributed to @entity2 , under government plans to limit access to handouts			1
@entity6 today announced the period for which @entity9 migrants can claim benefits is to be halved and recruitment agencies are to be banned from advertising jobs exclusively overseas			1
but work and pensions secretary @entity13 revealed plans to go even further to secure @entity16 agreement to stop benefits being paid to people who have not contributed to to the state , raising the prospect of handouts being linked to tax payments			2
in january , the government introduced rules that meant @entity9 migrants had to wait three months before they could claim out - of - work benefits – and then could only claim for a maximum of six months			1
today mr @entity6 said the claim period will be cut from six months to three months from november and applied to jobseekers ’ allowance , child tax credit and child benefit			0
the government will also stop recruitment firms from advertising @entity2 jobs elsewhere in the @entity16 without also doing so in the @entity2 – in @entity45			1
agencies have been accused of recruiting only foreign workers for specific shifts , for jobs such as fruit picking and hotel work , without even offering a chance to @entity2 citizens			1
but mr @entity13 said this was the limit of what the government could within @entity9 law , but ministers are pushing to go further			0
he said there was ' growing consensus ' with countries like @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 to limit access to migrants who have not contributed to the state			2
mr @entity13 told @entity68 's @entity69 : ' what we ’re working on with others in @entity9 [ is ] that there should not be a right to just enter a country and claim benefits unless you ’ve contributed			0
mr @entity13 told @entity68 's @entity69 : ' what we ’re working on with others in @entity9 [ is ] that there should not be a right to just enter a country and claim benefits unless you ’ve contributed			0
he said there was ' growing consensus ' with countries like @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 to limit access to migrants who have not ' so the eventual plan – and this is where we want to be and i think there is a lot of general agreement about this – is that people should have contributed to the system when they come in before being able to claim anything			1
' in addition to the crackdown on benefits , to highlight the government 's tough stance on immigration , @entity6 the home secretary @entity97 joined a raid on a property in @entity106 where illegal immigrants were thought to be living the government will prohibit recruitment firms from advertising @entity2 jobs elsewhere in the @entity16 without also doing so in the @entity2 – in @entity45 key measures announced today include : he said that under the last @entity115 government it was possible to claim housing benefit ' so their immigration policies did leave a very , very big open door			1
we ’re shutting that door , but we ’ve yet more to do '			0
on a visit to an immigration raid in @entity106 , mr @entity6 claimed the changes announced today will save the @entity2 taxpayer half a billion pounds over the next five years			2
during this morning 's raid , immigration officers found four @entity128 men aged between 27 and 31 , along with one minor , who all entered the country illegally			0
in the same house , they detained a @entity132 woman , aged 35 , who had overstayed her visa , while at a separate address was a 35 - year - old @entity136 visa overstayer who was in possession of a false @entity140 passport			2
a @entity142 spokesman said all of them have been taken to immigration detention pending removal from the country , apart from the minor , who is in the care of social services			0
the prime minister said the crackdown was the latest attempt to reverse a ‘ soft touch ’ approach adopted by @entity115 , who he accused of ‘ practically sending out search parties ’ for people to come to @entity2			1
he claimed so - called ‘ highly skilled ’ migrants allowed in under the last government had ended up ‘ stacking shelves ’			1
mr @entity6 said : ' let 's be clear - some people are coming here to work , some people are coming here to claim , some people are coming here pretending to be students			2
i have a very clear approach to this , which is , if you do n't have a right to be here , you will be sent home , you should n't be here			0
' people want to know that , yes , we have a fair legal migration system but , in terms of illegal migration , we will find you and we will send you home			2
' he added : ' we want an immigration system that puts @entity2 first and so what we 're doing today is a whole series of changes that says to people if you come here illegally we will make it harder for you to have a home , to get a car , to have a job , to get a bank account , and when we find you - and we will find you - we 'll make sure you 're sent back to the country that you came from			1
' during this morning 's raid , immigration officers found four @entity128 men aged between 27 and 31 , along with one minor , who all entered the country illegally mr @entity6 said the latest crackdown was an attempt to reverse a ‘ soft touch ’ approach adopted by @entity115 , who he accused of ‘ practically sending out search parties ’ for people to come to @entity2 mr @entity6 will also warn that some universities and colleges could lose their licences to recruit overseas students in a tightening of visa rules			1
ministers say a current 20 per cent tolerance threshold of student visa refusals that education institutions are allowed before losing their ‘ highly trusted ’ status is too generous			0
it is expected to be lowered to 10 per cent			0
other measures coming into force include attempts to rein in abuse of @entity221 – the right to family life – by migrants to avoid deportation			0
in future , judges will have to consider the @entity2 public interest too , mr @entity6 said			2
@entity115 's home affairs spokesman @entity229 said ' we have had reannouncement after reannouncement from the @entity232 but little in the way of firm action ' the government is also introducing a new system of ‘ deport now , appeal later ’ , designed to help the authorities remove foreign criminals – who will have to launch any appeal from their own country rather than delaying their departure with endless legal action			2
‘ under @entity115 , 2.5million more people came to this country than left			1
as @entity246 has admitted , they were practically sending out ' search parties ' for people to come here , ’ the prime minister said			1
‘ it used to be that @entity9 jobseekers could claim @entity251 ( jobseekers ’ allowance ) or child benefit for a maximum of six months before their benefits would be cut off , unless they had very clear job prospects			0
' we will be reducing that cut - off point to three months , saying very clearly : you can not expect to come to @entity2 and get something for nothing			1
’ shadow home secretary @entity229 said the government was failing on immigration despite mr @entity6 's promise to get it down to the tens of thousands			0
' we need less talk from the prime minister on immigration and more action , ' she said			0
' it 's almost a year and a half since @entity115 called for benefit restrictions on new migrants			1
in that time we 've had reannouncement after reannouncement from the @entity232 but little in the way of firm action			0
' behind the rhetoric , the true picture of this government on immigration is one of failure , with net migration going up , despite @entity6 's promise to get it down to the tens of thousands			0
' the government should get a grip and finally implement @entity115 's proposals to stop the undercutting of wages and jobs for local workers by the exploitation of low - skilled migrant labour , including banning recruitment agencies that only hire foreign workers and pressing for stronger controls in @entity9			1

recruitment agencies will be banned from only advertising jobs overseas
@entity246 says so - called ' highly skilled ' migrants ended up ' stacking shelves '
@entity115 ' practically sent out search parties ' for people to come to @entity2
