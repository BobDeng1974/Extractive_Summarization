our store managers use their common sense			0
dress code : customers without shirts and shoes are barred from entering @entity25 's @entity10 after complaints from other shoppers ' this kind of decision is made on a store - by - store basis and at the manager 's discretion as a result of a customer raising the issue with the team			1
' so it is often in response to issues that have been brought to us and the store has decided in this case to address them			0
' customers have been told of the new rules in a sign posted in the shop 's windows			0
belies and bare feet have both been barred from the @entity10 branch after the exposed flesh caused others ' embarrassment ' it says : ' to avoid causing offence or embarrassment to others , as well as for health and safety reasons , we ask that customers are appropriately dressed when visiting our stores			1
