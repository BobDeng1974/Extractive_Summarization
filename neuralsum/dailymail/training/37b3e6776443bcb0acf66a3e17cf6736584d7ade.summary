by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 11:42 est , 14 march 2014 the @entity3 administration has enlisted the help of the mothers of celebrities to encourage young americans to sign up for health insurance			1
the mothers of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 were all featured in a new ad released on friday by the @entity15			1
the ad comes as the march 31 deadline for enrolling in health insurance rapidly approaches , and young @entity7 have been some of the slowest to act			1
enlisting the moms : the @entity3 administration is trying to encourage young voters to sign up for heath care before march 31 so they avoid a tax penalty different look : mrs @entity23 is seen with her daughter @entity24 , who is an active @entity3 supporter , at an awards ceremony in 2008 in order for the @entity28 to function as it was designed , the administration banked on having a significant number of younger - and generally healthier - @entity7 enrol to help offset the costs of their elders			1
the latest report by the @entity33 revealed that only 25 per cent of @entity7 between the ages of 18 and 34 have signed up , and the economist estimates that 40 per cent would need to in order to allow the system to work			1
' @entity39 people feel invincible and until something actually happens , they will continue to feel invincible and unfortunately things do happen , ' said @entity42 , @entity10 's mother			2
this is the second video push aimed at young voters this week , as president @entity3 sat down for a mock interview with @entity46 on @entity47			2
@entity11 's mother @entity48 and @entity10 's mother @entity42 laughed about how their ' rambunctious ' sons and warned how people feel invincible when they 're young fun with their sons : mrs @entity48 accompanied @entity11 to the @entity53 earlier this month while mrs @entity42 is seen with @entity10 at a @entity55 game in 2009 that video took the viral route , with the president and the the @entity60 star trading barbs			1
today 's video went for the softer approach , with the moms reflecting on their celebrity children before they were famous			2
mrs @entity42 called her son ' rambunctious , mischievous , naughty ' and @entity11 's mother @entity48 painted the picture a bit more clearly by telling how he ' flooded the elementary school ' and ' would lie on top of my dashboard and literally not get up '			0
' seriously , do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown ? you need health insurance , it is imperative that you have health insurance , ' said mrs @entity48 , who recently accompanied her son to the @entity53			0
' taking care of yourself so your mothers can sleep after all they 've done for you is not too much to ask in my opinion			0
' @entity12 ' mom @entity81 said that because her daughter ' only had to hear a song once and she could play it so she never thought she had to practice '			0
gymnast or singer : @entity13 's mother @entity86 said that her daughter 's physicality as a child made her think she would be an athlete later in life close to mom : @entity13 brought her mother to a @entity94 event held in @entity95 in 2011 guilt trip : mrs @entity3 capped off the video by pointing viewers to @entity99 @entity13 's mother @entity86 said that her daughter was very active and started walking at 8 months and climbing out of her crib by her first birthday			1
' at one point i thought " well maybe she should be a gymnast , " ' ms @entity86 said			0
the video finished with @entity3 driving the point home			0
' we nag you because we love you			0
