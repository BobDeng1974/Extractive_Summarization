in a scathing report , the watchdog said airport bosses needed to ‘ get a grip ’ to ensure more passengers are never again failed by poor and inadequate contingency planning			1
the flooding fiasco should be ‘ a wake - up call for airports across the @entity56 ’ in tackling foreseeable disruption ’ , the @entity51 said			2

one said : ‘ many toilets , which were reliant on electronic flushing mechanisms , were out of action , @entity83 police had to step in to keep order amid the chaos and lack of loudspeaker announcements			2
@entity92 passengers @entity93 and @entity94 are quoted by mps in the report saying : ‘ as a result of @entity92 staff ’s unwavering refusal to speak to customers or provide any information in the terminal , we received no food or drink vouchers at any stage during our 11 hours at @entity5			1
’ had @entity92 informed them that their luggage was unlikely to be on the plane , ‘ we would have bought some essentials from the airport to relieve the stress and discomfort , ’ they said			2
dr @entity113 said : ‘ all this time no food was provided at any point by @entity22 ( 13 hours total )			0
’ @entity116 says : ‘ @entity117 failed at every stage to notify the public of what was happening			2
’ and @entity121 said they received no food or water : ‘ more shockingly , the washroom facilities were appalling			2
the toilets were a disgrace			0
they did not flush and the putrid stench was overpowering			0
’ even @entity130 peer @entity129 , caught up in the chaos spoke of ‘ distressed and crying and shouting children ’ and the ‘ massive queue to the only functioning loo			2
’ passengers wait in the departure hall of @entity5 's @entity137 as severe weather caused delays and cancellations to numerous flights passengers were left for up to 12 hours without heating , hot food or drink and just one toilet to access @entity147 tells mps : ‘ 19 hours without food or fluid ; 15 hours standing ; 15 hours without access to toilets ; 2 days lost holiday ; 2 nights lost sleep			1
’ many phoned relatives outside the airport to find out from news reports what was happening			2
@entity160 spoke of lost luggage , distress , and the ‘ joy of securing the last chicken ’ in @entity165 but noted : ‘ as far as we were concerned our @entity6 was cancelled			0
’ today the @entity167 thanked those passengers who wrote with their testimony			0
they said the main problems had been poor and often inconsistent provision of information about what was happening , lack of clarity about who was in charge , and a lack of basic facilities , such as toilets and drinking water			0
@entity6 plans were badly affected for thousands of people after storms across the @entity56 resulted in flooding and caused havoc at @entity5 passengers gave evidence to mps of the shocking conditions in which they were left for up to 12 hours without heating the committee welcomed a key conclusion from @entity196 s own review of the events on @entity198 which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals the chaos at @entity5 was compounded when airport bosses sought to switch passengers from the blighted @entity137 to the still - working @entity206 in a move that ‘ was not well tested			1
’ mps were particularly concerned the ‘ that contingency planning had not involved major airlines			0
’ launching the report today , the committee ’s chairman @entity211 , @entity130 mp for @entity213 said : ‘ passengers need accurate and consistent information , must be able to identify who is in charge during periods of disruption , and should have ready access to toilets and drinking water			2
‘ if our largest airports can not demonstrate they can look after passengers ’ interests in this way then the @entity224 must act			0
’ she added : ‘ passengers must also be promptly reimbursed for the extra costs they face as a consequence of disruption			0
' mrs @entity211 said : ‘ it was clear from evidence to this inquiry that there is considerable scope for airlines to ensure passengers are far better informed about their rights when flights are delayed or cancelled and how to enforce these rights			0
’ passengers need accurate and consistent information , @entity130 mp @entity211 said the flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport @entity250 the committee welcomed a key conclusion from @entity5 ’s own review of the events on @entity198 which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals , to focus on passenger welfare			1
the committee suggested that similar arrangements should also be put in place at other major @entity56 airports			0
@entity5 ’s own report into the chaos concluded in february that passengers were failed because airport bosses ‘ overreached themselves ’ and communications to passengers were ‘ disappointingly poor ’			1
the flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport ’s @entity137			1
but rather than cancel flights straight away managers tried to get as many people away as possible - by switching them to the unaffected @entity206			0
however , this merely added to the chaos			0
@entity5 non-executive director @entity280 said in own february report : ‘ on this occasion , the airport community overreached itself in seeking to maintain a close - to - normal flying programme on the day			1
mps demanded to know why the country ¿ s second - biggest airport had been unable to cope with flooding ‘ in doing so , while the majority of airport passengers flew that day , a very significant number of passengers endured poor levels of service and information before seeing their flights either substantially delayed or , ultimately , cancelled			1
’ mps had earlier accused country ’s second - biggest airport - owned by an @entity301 private equity @entity300 of failing to invest at @entity5 while making bumper profits			1
transport committee chairman @entity211 said the sorts of problems encountered by @entity5 should not have been unforeseen , unexpected or unprepared for : ‘ the problems that unfolded were not new and the whole event should be a wake - up call for airports across the @entity56 to improve their operational resilience			2
’ this was the scene at @entity314 on christmas eve amid chaos around the airport the report itself concludes : ‘ none of the issues discussed in our report is new			1
contingency planning , communications and passenger welfare were all covered in the @entity327 report into disruption at @entity329 due to snow in december 2011			0
, themes we then picked up in our 2011 report on the disruption to transport caused by snow and ice			0
’ it added : ‘ the @entity224 recently told us that it had already given the industry some guidance about what is expected in relation to oversight of operational resilience			0
’ mps said the @entity224 had told them : ‘ if the plans produced by airports over the @entity348 and @entity349 do not include all appropriate elements , we will use our licence powers to requite this to be remedied			0
