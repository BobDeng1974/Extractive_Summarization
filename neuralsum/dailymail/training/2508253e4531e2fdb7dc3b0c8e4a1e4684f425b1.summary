the @entity9 heard that @entity1 , 30 , who was bitter at missing out on a promotion , had phoned the @entity8 embassy in a bid to betray his country			1
he offered information about sailing dates and movements of @entity18 submarines that would have revealed the unique sound ‘ signature ’ given off by the @entity6 nuclear craft , meaning they could have been tracked around the globe			2
the court heard that @entity1 , who had been a communications engineer on nuclear sub @entity24 , rang the @entity8 embassy in november last year after what he said was a 12 - hour drinking binge			1
@entity1 , from @entity29 , said he had been disillusioned with the @entity3 because his promotion hopes had been dashed through defence cuts			1
but he was drinking heavily , had bouts of depression and had just been cleared of a rape charge			2
he asked for his training course for promotion to be deferred for a year but his absences without leave and conduct had led to a warning that he would be sacked if his behaviour continued , the court heard			0
two days after the phone call , he managed to get into a locked safe on board @entity24 and take three photographs of part of a secret code for encrypted information on his mobile phone			1
covert operations : @entity24 could have been compromised , had @entity1 actually sold secrets it was only through the vigilance of @entity55 officers who mounted a sting operation where they pretended to be @entity8 spies that national security was not harmed , said @entity59 , prosecuting			1
in an exchange of text messages , @entity1 had told one of the fake spies : ' i am disillusioned by my employers and i feel let down by them			1
think we can help each other , ' the court heard			0
he also texted : ' i am in the @entity3 and i am a bit p * * * * * off with them at the moment			0
' @entity1 pleaded guilty to breaching the @entity71 by gathering classified information and misconduct by meeting the supposed spies			1
the officer worked in the ' highly sensitive ' communication centre of nuclear submarines , and had served on three of the four @entity18 vessels in the fleet			0
after his arrest , he had been questioned about his motives			0
the officer called the @entity8 embassy saying he wanted to ' hurt ' the @entity3 after his hopes of a promotion were dashed mr @entity87 said : ' he explained that he was disenchanted with his work and he wanted to hurt the @entity3			1
' it had been explained to @entity1 that the two men , known to him as @entity91 and @entity92 , who he met at the @entity93 and who took him to a @entity96 hotel , were not @entity8			1
mr @entity87 added : ' the highly secret information was therefore contained			1
' although the actual damage caused proved to be minimal , that was not due to the defendant but to the skilful work of the secret service			0
' mr @entity103 , sentencing him at the @entity9 , said @entity1 knew what he was doing when he met the two men in january			1
mr @entity103 added : ' he did supply details of movements and operations carried out and to be carried out by nuclear submarines			0
' i am satisfied that in the wrong hands it was capable of affecting the operational effectiveness of nuclear submarines			0
' this is a very serious case			0
the defendant was prepared to betray his country and his colleagues			0
' the petty officer thought he was talking to two spies when he met the men in the @entity6 museum outside court , solicitor @entity122 read a statement on behalf of @entity1 which said : “ i am deeply sorry for the hurt and shame that i have brought on my family and loved ones			1
' prior to these events i gave the @entity3 11 and a half years of service and i deeply regret my actions and the effect they have had on the @entity134 and colleagues			0
' @entity136 , unit head for the @entity139 counter-terrorism division , said : ' this was a classic story of betrayal			0
' @entity1 was employed by the @entity3 to protect this country from potential threats to our security			2
instead , he pursued a course of conduct likely to put his country at risk			0
' we rely on the men and women of our armed forces to keep us safe			0
it is hard to imagine a greater breach of that role than @entity1 ’s actions			2
' the judge said : ' the photographs could , with other information , have led to the breaking of the code			1
' he added : ' the defendant made determined efforts to enter into an agreement to supply secret information to representatives of another country			2
' the reason he later gave for his actions was that he wished to get his own back on the @entity3 who he considered had treated him badly			0
' but the judge added : ' the objective evidence is that the @entity3 treated him well			0
' @entity178 , for @entity1 , read out a statement from him which said : ' i would like to apologise for the shame i brought on the @entity3			2
' he said @entity1 had been ' something of a blue - eyed boy ' until things began to go awry			1
the rape allegation led to a general collapse in @entity1 ’s behaviour .			2
