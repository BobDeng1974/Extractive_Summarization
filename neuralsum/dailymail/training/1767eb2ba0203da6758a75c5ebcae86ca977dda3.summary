' to have an actor pretending to be my father is an insult to the memories of his victims , ' says mother of two @entity9 - @entity8 @entity10 have ' let former colleagues down ' by being involved by @entity12 last updated at 3:45 pm on 2nd september 2011 the daughter of serial killer @entity14 branded actor @entity15 a ' hypocrite ' after he claimed he felt ' sullied ' and suffered nightmares while playing the murderer in a new tv drama			1
@entity9 - @entity8 , 47 , criticised the cast , programme makers and police for their controversial roles in @entity24 , a new @entity26 production about the murders of women and girls at 25 @entity30 , @entity10			1
she said : ' when an actor like @entity15 talks about being '' sullied '' by the role and talks of nightmares , you have to question their hypocrisy			1
' hypocrisy ' : @entity9 - @entity8 ( left ) who was raped and tortured by her father @entity14 , has criticised actor @entity15 for saying he had nightmares playing her father in a new drama ( right ) ' what of the victims who survived and all the victims ' families who have lived with this for more than two decades ? he has had but a glimpse of their world			1
' the mother - of - two slammed @entity26 for using the ' @entity55 brand ' in a ' global money - making exercise '			1
mass murderer @entity14 , 53 , hanged himself in @entity57 on @entity58 1995 as he awaited trial for 12 murders			0
his wife @entity61 , 57 , is serving a full - life term in @entity63 after she was found guilty of her part in ten murders including that of her 16 - year - old daughter @entity67 at @entity68 in 1995			1
the @entity26 drama is seen through the eyes of the ' appropriate adult ' @entity72 , who acted as an independent safeguard by sitting in on @entity14 's police interviews			0
ms @entity8 was raped and tortured by the @entity76 when she was eight and her mother @entity78 and sisters @entity77 and @entity67 were murdered			1
@entity80 condemned current @entity82 police chiefs for assisting @entity26 production staff , a decision which has concerned retired officers who worked on the @entity87 case and pledged to look after the victims ' families			1
she said : ' i believe that decision is pretty lame and the current regime should be ashamed of the position they have put the victims ' families in , and ashamed that they have let down former colleagues whose morality was , and remains , so resolute			1
' @entity26 have used the police input to advertise the validity of their research			0
it is questionable whether police resources should be spent helping a private enterprise that exploits the victims of crime for profit			2
' twisted : @entity108 and @entity61 at the wedding of their daughter @entity80 ( pictured left of her father ) @entity15 , who starred in @entity114 and @entity115 drama @entity116 , has previously said how he suffered ' pretty horrible dreams during the shoot where i 'm perched on a wall and @entity14 was trying to grab me and pull me down			2
' i was fairly determined not to let him get to me			0
i only did it for three weeks and it was a pretty intense , very dark three weeks			0
' ms @entity8 has been critical of the new , two - part drama throughout its making			1
she said : ' i 'm still unsure whether @entity26 and the actors comprehend the depth of our grief , but how could they ? i just ask that they spare a thought for the victims and their families when they pick up their pay cheques			2
' we live in an age of multiple tv channels , many of which regularly screen repeats			0
that means for the rest of our lives this programme will be re-run over and over			0
' whilst @entity15 moves on to his next role , another life sentence will start for all of the families			0
' ms @entity8 , who gave evidence against @entity61 at her trial , has refused to watch the first 90 - minute episode of @entity24 when it is screened at the weekend			1
monster : serial killer @entity14 with e daughters @entity80 ( standing ) and @entity155 she said : ' i find the whole idea of this production sickening , but i have tried to be balanced in my criticisms			0
' i have enough emotional and mental baggage and i do n't need an actor to haunt or further remind me of the crimes my father perpetrated			1
' many people think that it 's my perception there will be re-enactments of murder and gratuitous violence and that is why i am so disturbed			0
' my frustration stems from the resurrection of my father on screen , the re-enactments of dialogue between interviewing police officers and my father describing the circumstances surrounding my mother 's and sisters ' disappearances , their murders and his subsequent disposal of their bodies			1
' no doubt , the same treatment will be given to the other victims and the effect this will have on their families must be considered			2
' she added : ' i had n't spoken publicly for ten years until this drama was mooted			0
i have never put myself forward as a spokesperson for the victims ' families , and i never will			2
evil : @entity197 and @entity14 tortured , raped and murdered at least 12 young women at the @entity10 home ' maybe , as a member of the @entity14 family , i should n't have a view			1
all i can say is that i speak for my sanity			0
' it is indicative of our society that we have n't moved on from the voyeurism that surrounds the '' @entity55 '' branding and i suggest that @entity26 would n't have invested so heavily in '' the @entity209 '' without it			0
' i congratulate them for finding their angle , riding high on the back of mrs @entity72			0
they have walked a tightrope , balancing the validity and compassion for mrs @entity72 with the memory of the victims and their families ' grief - and they have opted to fall on the side of mrs @entity72			1
" i would ask people to put aside that voyeurism for just a few minutes and consider the victims of all such crime , their families and the life sentences they have to serve - without choice			1
' ms @entity8 , who was sexually abused by @entity108 and @entity61 and other men they brought to 25 @entity30 , managed to flee the family home when she was 15 in just the clothes she was wearing			1
she said : ' my mother @entity235 and my sisters @entity77 and @entity67 , are my heroes			2
i was an eight - year - old coward and i was still a coward when i ran away			2
' but my mother and siblings stood up to them and paid the ultimate price			2
to have an actor pretending to be my father and describing how he murdered and disposed of their bodies i find an insult to their memories because they were real people , not just a name on a page , who deserve a little more respect			1
' the mother of two described the lasting effect that the horrific experiences had on her own life			2
' there was no doubting the overwhelming sense of emptiness and loss			0
justice had been served and now it was time to try and pack away the memories of past and present , except it was not that easy			0
' there was little support available locally and the @entity270 just did n't know what to do with me and i am ashamed to admit that i attempted to take my own life on a number of occasions and i am lucky to be alive			0
' it would take years before i got the kind of counselling and professional support that i desperately needed			0
