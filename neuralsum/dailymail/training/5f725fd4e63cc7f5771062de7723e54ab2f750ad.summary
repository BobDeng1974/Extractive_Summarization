the holodeck was a refuge for countless stressed crew members on the @entity3 , allowing them to escape the isolation of space			1
now researchers in the @entity7 are hoping to bring @entity9 - style technology to future long - duration space missions in an effort help astronaut 's keep their sanity			2
the ' @entity14 ' will act as a source of refuge for astronauts , as well as a computerised therapist that will check on their mental health through a series of programs			1
escape plan : the system will use @entity24 , the virtual reality headset that @entity25 is developing , with the addition sounds and smells that could help change an astronaut 's mood @entity31 's @entity30 and innovation lab , or @entity33 , is currently creating the technology for the system with funding from @entity37			1
the system will use @entity24 , the virtual reality headset that @entity25 is developing , with the addition of sounds and smells that could help change an astronaut 's mood			1
it will ' trick the brain and make people feel as if they are in a variety of beautiful and calm settings , such as with their family at home or strolling on the beach , ' @entity31 professor @entity43 said			0
for instance , an astronaut 's virtual reality program could include photos and video of their spouse and children , images of a beach , sounds of waves crashing , odours of saltwater and suntan lotion and a fan to simulate ocean breezes			1

now researchers in the @entity7 are hoping to bring this @entity9 - style technology to future long - duration space missions in an effort help astronaut 's keep their sanity @entity76 , we have a problem : the system is designed to take care of an astronaut 's mental health and prevent arguments on board long duration missions to the outer solar system ' we will use state - of - the - art virtual reality technology to help with the effects of isolation , ' added @entity89 , the lead @entity33 designer and project manager on the project			1
imagine a miniature robo - surgeon sliding into your body through an incision in your stomach			0
once inside , the robot can expertly manoeuvre its way around the abdominal cavity , which has been filled with gas to make more room for work			0
it can then perform procedures such as an emergency appendectomy or perforate a gastric ulcer			0
this is the scenario being explored by @entity37 in the hope that risky surgical operations in space will someday become a routine matter			0
working in collaboration with @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117 , the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely - operated fist - sized robot doctor			0
the 0.9lb ( 0.4kg ) has two arms fitted with tools to hold , cauterise and suture tissue , while its head is a small video @entity127 camera feed is sent to a control station , where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks			0
' while this work is in an early phase , the minimal invasiveness of this approach could enable its use in remote locations such as on a moon or @entity142 colony , ' researchers wrote in a technical paper on the prototype			0
' we 're building all the new technology for this project and doing the interface and interaction design work from scratch			0
' @entity33 lab is porting the existing content to a @entity154 game and creating both the content and framework for the virtual reality component			1
' people have long thought that virtual reality can be therapeutic in addition to being used in gaming and entertainment			1
' to upgrade the existing content , the @entity164 system has been delivered for testing at the @entity168 ( @entity167 which is starting today in @entity169			1
a team of six members will spend eight months in simulated @entity142 habitat â€“ double the length of the previous longest @entity168 mission			1
the @entity31 team also plans to test the system in @entity177 , which is used as an analogue to long - duration spaceflights due to its isolation , length of stay and team composition			2
the current @entity164 system includes a suite of multimedia programs , including self - guided training on conflict and stress management			2
the program also offers a six - session , self - administered depression treatment program guided by psychologist @entity192 , a professor at @entity31 's @entity193 and a co-investigator on the project			0
astronauts currently have audio and video access to psychologists only when communication links are available			2
on longer missions like those to @entity142 , transmission delays will make real - time therapy problematic			0
computer - based treatment offers an autonomous way to address these important problems			0
the latest system allows astronauts to seek help confidentially on their laptops and monitors their mental health and conducts therapeutic sessions			1
the program is designed for astronauts , but it could also be adapted to treat people on @entity215			2
for instance , it could be used in rural areas where clinical help is limited or non-existent			0
the program is designed for astronauts on missions to places such as @entity142 ( artist 's impression pictured ) , but it could also be adapted to treat people on @entity215			2

the ' @entity14 ' will act as a source of refuge for astronauts
it will use @entity24 virtual reality headset as well as sounds and smells
it is being tested on the @entity168 simulation in @entity169 which begins today
the latest system also allows astronauts to seek help confidentially on their laptops and monitors their mental health with a virtual therapist
