the prime minister will claim in his speech to the @entity10 conference today that only the @entity11 will stand up for businesses that ‘ get wages in people ’s pockets and food on their tables ’			1
attacking the ‘ anti-business ’ agenda laid out by @entity20 leader @entity19 last week , he will insist that enterprise , not a larger state , is the answer to @entity2 ’s economic woes			1
prime minister @entity1 prepares his speech for his keynote address to the @entity10 conference in @entity28			2
he says the @entity11 will fight for businesses he will also make his frankest admission of the weaknesses of the @entity32 , saying it is clear @entity2 needs a strong majority government ‘ with a clear mandate ’ that is ‘ accountable for what it promises ’			1
he will say the ‘ great @entity10 mission ’ is to build a land of opportunity as the economy recovers			2
but attempts to focus on the improving economy were dealt a blow last night when cabinet minister @entity44 said the ‘ ordinary member of the public is n’t feeling much benefit ’ because earnings were not going up in line with prices			2
however , mr @entity1 insisted last night that @entity2 was ‘ going from rescue to recovery ’ , adding : ‘ the public understand the mess we were left ... they know we have been doing a rescue mission			1
' it is time for a government with a stronger mandate and a clearer accountability , so you know that what you get in the manifesto happens in government			2
@entity66 arrives at the @entity10 in @entity28 last night ‘ that means a @entity10 - only government			0
’ after last week ’s pledge from mr @entity19 to intervene in the energy market , cancel a corporation tax cut , to freeze business rates , make some firms pay a higher minimum wage and penalise those that fail to take on apprentices , mr @entity1 will seek to cast the @entity77 as anti-business			1
he will say : ‘ profit , wealth creation , tax cuts , enterprise are not dirty , elitist words , they ’re not the problem			0
they really are the solution because it ’s not government that creates jobs , it ’s businesses			1
‘ there is no shortcut to a land of opportunity			0
you build it business by business , school by school , person by person , patiently , practically , painstakingly			0
' and under - pinning it all is that deep , instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools , they will succeed			0
' this party at its heart is about big people , strong communities , responsible businesses , a bigger society – not a bigger state			1
‘ it ’s how we ’ve been clearing up the mess			0
so let ’s stick with it and finish the job			0
‘ our economy , our society , welfare , schools , all reformed , all rebuilt with one aim : to make this country a land of opportunity for all			0
‘ you do n’t help people by leaving them on welfare , but by helping them stand on their own two feet			2
why ? because the best way out of poverty is work and the dignity that brings			0
