former @entity1 senator @entity0 thinks president @entity2 , a fellow @entity3 , was re-elected in 2012 because he ' sucked less ' than former @entity5 gov. @entity4			1
the @entity7 straight - talker told @entity8 in an exclusive interview that @entity2 is n't up to the job of bringing liberals and conservatives to the table to rescue @entity1 's slowly choking entitlement programs			1
and @entity2 , he said wednesday in his @entity16 office , knew full well he was lying when he promised that the @entity17 would allow @entity1 to keep insurance plans they liked			1
' he had to know he was misleading the audience , ' @entity0 said quietly , recalling the newly minted president 's countless promises as @entity22 and the public debated his signature health insurance overhaul			1
not your typical @entity3 : former @entity7 sen. @entity0 opened up with @entity8 about his disappointments with his party and his president ' if you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan ' : @entity0 says many politicians suffer from ' self - delusion ' that makes it easier to lie to the public ' on the other hand , he may have said it so many times , ' he added , ' that the spell - checker was n't in the room – the spell - checker , the fact - checker – somebody who says , " excuse me , mr. president , but i hope you know this ... " ' @entity2 's infamous four - @entity46 pledges , @entity0 explained , never stood a chance of being fulfilled because there were ' a million people out there with policies that , for one reason or another , run short of the minimum standard			1
i mean , they bought something cheaper ! ' the @entity57 understood the numbers , @entity0 said , and republicans did a poor job of explaining the basics of the insurance industry to low - information voters			1
insurers , he said the @entity65 could have made clear , make money by ' not paying claims , ' and by making sure that ' 80 per cent of the people that are buying insurance do n't need it			2
... so i need young people to sign up			0
that 's what it 's all about			2
' the worst lie @entity77 told about @entity17 , @entity0 reasoned , ' is not " if you want to keep your health care plan ... " – the worst one is , " everybody deserves high - quality , affordable health care			1
" ' ' excuse me ? uh , i do n't know if you 've heard about the bell curve ? ' he snarked			0
' if i 've got 1,000 doctors , 100 are great , and 100 are not so good			0
' he outlined the shape of a bell curve with his hands , and then threw them skyward			0
' it 's absolutely impossible , ' he said			2
' and affordable ? forget about it			0
' @entity95 is best known for calling former sen. @entity96 an ' * * * hole ' in the @entity98 , and for calling @entity99 an ' unusually good liar ' @entity95 has kept his oar in foreign policy , helming the @entity103 for many years in @entity104 where he rubbed elbows with foreign leaders like @entity109 chancellor @entity108 ( @entity110 ) when the @entity17 met its most vigorous @entity65 opposition in late 2009 , the @entity1 economy was still floundering and the business community 's eyes were focused on gdp growth , not a new set of health - benefit mandates			1
' i would n't have done health care , ' @entity0 said			1
' i think the big mistake was ... to say , " whew ! we 've got the stimulus done , okay , the economy 's going to come bouncing back in 12 months – let 's do health care , " ' he explained			1
' only the economy did n't come bouncing back			0
' ' we 're teetering on the edge of going out of business through most of 2009 , ' @entity0 recalled			2
' and i think you need to just keep driving , driving , driving on the economy , and make it as bipartisan as possible			0
' life - long pol : in 1992 then - sen. @entity95 made an ultimately failed bid for the @entity77 presidential nomination that eventually went to @entity99 @entity2 compounded his rhetorical mistakes with political ones , he said , by agreeing to ditch a proposal allowing @entity1 to buy into the @entity138 system the way they would buy a policy from a private insurer			1
' " and now you want to do health care , " @entity0 imagined @entity77 pols telling @entity2 near the end of his first year in office			1
' it 's okay , you 're going to do health care			1
i have n't talked you out of it , mr. president			0
[ but ] do n't give on the public option			0
' even if the @entity17 law had died in @entity22 , he insisted , the politics of holding fast to the public option would have favored democrats since @entity138 is among the federal government 's most universally popular programs			1
' i would have been much better off campaigning saying , " my opponent does not want you to have the right to buy into @entity138 , " ' @entity0 mused			2
in his @entity165 days , the former @entity7 governor often stood out as the rare @entity3 who publicly lamented @entity1 entitlement programs ' seemingly unstoppable march to insolvency			1
' we 're robbing from the future to pay for the past , ' he told @entity8 on wednesday			2
' ' and we 're shoveling more and more money to people over the age of 65			0
' a lack of political will and a healthy dose of electoral fear , he said , has virtually guaranteed a climate inside the @entity180 where no one will take the first step toward cutting benefits or ratcheting up the national retirement age			0
' it 's the one thing " r " s and " @entity187 " s can agree on , ' @entity0 explained			1
' do n't screw with seniors			0
' @entity0 is a decorated @entity190 veteran who has grappled with issues of conscience : he once acknowledged that a @entity194 combat mission for which he was awarded the @entity195 caused the deaths of 13 to 20 unarmed civilians , most of them women and children the result , he said , is a set of financial chains clamped tightly on future generations			2
during an ill - fated 2012 run to recapture his old @entity206 seat , @entity0 totaled up @entity208 's spending on @entity138 , @entity209 , and the long - term care portion of @entity211 , and divided it by the number of @entity1 in the work force			1
' all workers , ' he insisted , ' including government workers ! and the source of their contribution is entirely tax money ! but take all of it			0
' the cost , he determined , ' is $ 15,000 per year , per worker			0
' once a politician ... @entity0 tried to win back his old @entity206 seat in 2012 , only to be beaten in the primary by @entity226 , who ultimately won the general election asked how to break the congressional logjam , @entity0 thought for a moment and said , softly , ' it takes a president			1
' is @entity2 that president ? @entity0 stayed silent but shook his head			1
' i 'm shaking my head " no , " ' he acknowledged , finally			0
' if he was up to it , he would have done it			0
he ca n't run for re-election			0
' another of @entity2 's failings , according to @entity0 , is an inflated sense of @entity1 ' appetite for programs to correct what the @entity57 calls ' income inequality , ' through new taxes and other income - shifting initiatives that transfer wealth from the rich to the poor			1
the president 's re-election 17 months ago was n't a mandate to conduct class warfare , he said			2
' after the 2012 election , what the president needed was somebody to say , " mr. president , i 'm thrilled you won			0
you stand for all the things i support			0
but honestly , you won this election because you sucked less than @entity4			0
" ' @entity1 , @entity0 believes , lost patience equally with the @entity65 and the @entity57 during the kabuki theater of fiscal cliff , congressional ' super committee , ' budget sequester and tense partial government shutdown			1
@entity2 stuck to his guns at the time , holding out for a ' balanced ' budget - gap fix that included new taxes on upper - income @entity1			1
' everybody since 1913 has had a mandate to raise taxes on the rich , ' @entity0 scoffed at his party 's leader			1
' this is n't something that you 've earned , something that 's unique			0
' @entity283 : as governor of @entity7 , @entity0 dated actress @entity285 for more than two years , telling reporters that she ' swept me off my foot ' ( he lost part of one leg in the @entity291			2
) @entity2 is n't the first president to make that kind of miscalculation – @entity0 calls it ' self - delusion ' – while in office			1
he joked that geneticists will one day soon ' find a base pair ' of genes that predisposes people to deception			0
and he predicted , half - seriously , that ' they 'll find another base pair which say that politicians have 25 per cent more capacity for – you call it lying , i call it self - delusion			0
' @entity99 , @entity0 once famously hinted , may have been that genetic trait 's @entity311 ideal			2
' he 's an unusually good liar			0
unusually good , ' the @entity7 said in 1994			0
he told @entity8 that he ' actually intended it as a compliment , ' although @entity99 ' did n't take it that way			2
' @entity2 's lies , he said , stem from the same human flaw			1
' that self - delusion moment comes in a single declaratory sentence , ' @entity0 said , which is , " if they just get to know me , they 'll vote for me			2
" ' ' it 's just self - delusion			2
... some of us are good at it , and some of us are bad			0

@entity0 , a two - term @entity327 in the ' 80s and ' 90s , is disappointed in the president for risking the health of the @entity1 economy over @entity17
' he had to know he was misleading the audience , ' he said of @entity2 's infamous ' if you like your health care plan ' deception
explains that an even bigger lie democrats tell is that ' everybody ' can get ' high - quality , affordable health care '
@entity2 , he says , lacks the *courage* to bring @entity77 and @entity65 together to save @entity1 entitlement programs from *bankruptcy*
' if he was up to it , he would have done it , ' @entity0 tells @entity8
