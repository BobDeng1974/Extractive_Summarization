by @entity0 the uproar over an @entity3 tv host who bragged about killing a defenceless lion before posing for a picture with its corpse may have persuaded many big game hunters to keep their heads down			1
but these bloodthirsty beauty queens have come out in support of the practice which was cast into the spotlight by @entity13 , drawing new attention to the popularity of hunting among women			2
@entity18 , 36 , and mother - of - two @entity19 , 39 , have shot more than 70 species - including lion , rhino and bears			1
they justified the actions of hunters , saying they are simply ' managing the herd ' @entity18 is a one time mrs @entity33 contestant and 2004 mrs @entity36 winner			1
despite travelling the world to hunt , she considers herself a conservationist @entity40 says she receives hoards of hate mail accusing her of being a self - gratifying killer , but she actually describe themselves herself as a ' true animal lover ' but despite receiving hoards of hate mail accusing them of being self - gratifying killers , the pair describe themselves as true ' animal lovers ' and say their kills help conservation			2
@entity19 , from @entity54 , said : ' you can be a hunter an a conservationist at the same time			1
people think you 're just killing stuff but if you do n't manage a herd then the whole of the herd will die			1
' we are taking care of the big picture			1
i feel the general public does n't realise that			2
' @entity19 , right , said she has been hunting since 2008 when her first kill was a black bear which she executed with one shot			1
@entity18 travels the world to stalk her prey , she is pictured in @entity75 having shot a stag , right this picture of @entity18 with an @entity78 she hunted and shot is reminiscent of the snap which @entity13 posted to global outrage @entity19 , pcitured with a 2000lbs buffalo , said she prefers to kill with a bow and arrow as it is more ' intimate ' @entity19 hunts with her family including her children , 14 year - old @entity88 , far right and and 11 year - old @entity89 , second from right the brunette has been hunting since 2008 and opened her account by killing a black bear with one shot			1
she said she felt ' on fire ' and instantly knew she wanted hunting to be part of her life and that of her two sons , @entity88 , 14 , and @entity89			2
@entity19 uses both a rifle and a bow - and - arrow to take down game throughout the @entity3 but prefers to use a bow as it is more ' intimate '			1
she added : ' i enjoy the challenge			2
i enjoy knowing the prize i 'm going after is out there and the excitement that goes along with pursuing it			0
' you feel so much respect when you walk up on an animal you have taken			0
you feel a connection to the animal , a very strong connection			0
' the pair are avid collectors of ' trophies ' and have houses full of their past kills which have been stuffed @entity18 has pictures with animals she has simply tranquilized for the photo opportunity			0
here she sits next to a sedated @entity122 she darted in @entity123 @entity18 hunted this @entity124 in the @entity125 , @entity126 @entity19 now has her sights set on being crowned @entity128 2013			1
the competition has been organised by @entity130 , from @entity131 , who has been hunting since she was 16			0
in that time she has killed more than 65 species across six continents and earned the world 's most prestigious accolade for a female hunter - the @entity138			1
the former mrs @entity33 contestant has shot in eight countries across @entity123 and killed a hippo , a @entity143 and darted a black rhino			1
but her ' most memorable ' hunt was shooting a male lion in @entity147 in @entity123			0
she said : ' i had n't planned on hunting lion but unexpectedly came across one and my professional hunter expressed urgency to react			0
i shouldered the rifle , shot and missed , encouraging the lion to run hastily into the forest ' @entity19 poses with a @entity156 which she hunted near her family home in @entity54 in on the act : @entity19 ' 11 year - old son @entity89 posing for a picture with his first hunt , a mountain lion , in @entity164 , @entity54 ' then a herd of angry elephants came out of the forest and charged with intention to kill us			1
this caused the lion to divert , granting me only a running shot			0
' i shouldered the rifle again and hit the lion by giving it a six - foot lead			0
it was a marvellous shot but the elephants were charging and we had to immediately react and so we shot in the air and shot at the ground to give them a warning and they stopped 20 yards away			0
' we went in after the wounded lion and he came running out of the forest to kill me			0
i shot and reloaded , shot and reloaded and the lion expired at my feet			0
' i was the first woman to kill a lion in that country and the celebrations were incredible			0
it was of significant importance to the villagers who 's cattle had been the target of such a beast			0
it was the hunt that shaped who i am			0
' killing runs in the blood for @entity19 , here she is seen posing with her first hunt , a bear , that got her into @entity208 and @entity209 record books at @entity210 in @entity54 ' intimate ' : @entity211 believes that killing an animal with a bow and arrow , which she is posing with above , gives her a greater connection to the beast she has executed @entity18 and @entity19 , who are both keen taxidermists and have huge trophy rooms , are no strangers to controversy - both in and outside the world of big game hunting			1
they say they are the targets of both anti-hunting protests and from male hunters who say that blood - sports are no place for women			1
however , @entity19 , who hunts primarily in the @entity3 , says she is doing nothing wrong and even donates her meat to food banks , while @entity18 says meat from her kills goes to the indigenous people			1
@entity18 added : ' wildlife abounds because hunters put money back into conservation			2
locked and loaded : @entity18 is less particular about how she kills her prey as she loads up a hunting rifle ahead of hunting indiscriminate : opre with a @entity244 , which is one of the 70 species she is estimated to have killed during her time hunting ' in foreign continents like @entity123 , we help to drill water wells for the natives and the wildlife			2
we help to build schools and medical facilities			0
we create jobs for trackers and skinners			0
' as hunters , we are providing the indigenous people with the protein they would n't have otherwise			2
nothing is wasted ; everything goes back into the circle of life			0
you can go on a photographic safari in @entity123 for $ 6,000 or you can take a big game hunting expedition for up to $ 125,000 - you do the math - who 's generating more money for the local economy ? ' she added : ' i see myself as the most important conservationist there is			1
hunters put back so much into the world 's great wildlife and make sure future generations can experience what our forefathers experienced			2
' beauty and the beast : @entity18 , pictured posing with a representation of a zebra , was once a winner of @entity288 and entered into the @entity290 beauty pageant wall of death : @entity26 considers herself a conservationist despite openly admitting to killing for sport			1

@entity26 and @entity19 are *prolific* big game hunters
between them , they have killed lions , rhinos and bears for sport
they claim they are conservationists who are ' managing the herd '
