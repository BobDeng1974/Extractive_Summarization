surgeons at the top hospital - which normally operates on those with only two legs - agreed to undertake the surgery for free			1
mr @entity11 was still left fearing the worst , however , when doctors said that operating costs of € 3000 ( £ 2,400 ) would still need to paid due to the specialist equipment used during the surgery			2
currently out of work , mr @entity28 was unable to foot the bill			0
but a charity , the @entity31 for the @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , soon came to the rescue , agreeing to pay 70 per cent of the bill and launching a @entity38 campaign to raise the rest			1

lots of them lead dogs ' lives			0
' he told @entity79 : ' on a personal level , i understand this man 's attachment to his dog and the fact that he wants to do everything to save it			0
but if you take a step back , you have to admit we live in a rather strange society			0

' without a care : the operation is usually only performed on humans but @entity1 's owner and @entity38 friends are hoping the operation will prove a success montsouris hospital in @entity4 , where @entity60 's ruptured artery will be treated			1
