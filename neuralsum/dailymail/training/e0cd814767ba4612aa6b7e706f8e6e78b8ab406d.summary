by @entity0 published : 12:47 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 17:02 est , 19 may 2012 miracle : @entity2 is enjoying life at nursery after a heart transplant two young girls were making new friends at nursery this week after spending months in hospital strapped to a life - saving artificial heart			1
@entity2 and @entity11 spent every hour of every day attached to the @entity12 at @entity14 's @entity13			1
their world was restricted by the 8ft of tubes and wires connecting them to the miracle machine			2
the youngsters ' own hearts had failed and @entity11 and @entity2 spent five and six months respectively rigged up to the contraption			1
it kept them alive by pumping blood around their body , while they waited for suitable donor organs to be found			1
the three - year - olds showed incredible determination to survive , with the risk of infection , blood clots or a fall ever present			2
their frightened parents spent up to 16 heart - wrenching hours a day by their side			1
@entity11 's dad @entity39 said : ' we were living from moment to moment			1
the journey begins , but you do n't know when it is going to end			0
' @entity2 's mum @entity45 , who left her other two children with their dad @entity47 and grandparents at home in @entity50 to be with her daughter			0
she told @entity52 : ' as a parent you try to give them a little bit of life , find ways to distracted her			2
' you have to be strong , you have to be there for your children			0
it is only when you come home that you realise what you have been through			0
' @entity2 and @entity11 , from the @entity66 area , arrived in cardiac intensive care in end - stage heart failure and were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy - a condition which did irreversible damage to their hearts and was thought to have been caused by a virus			1
@entity75 : @entity2 , 3 , spent months in hospital strapped to an artificial heart if they were struck down a few years earlier , the girls may not have survived , but advances in cardiothroaic care means doctors are able to stablise patients while they search for a positive organ match			1
@entity2 and @entity11 were up against a decline in donor numbers , with 167 adults and children on the waiting list compared to 124 a year ago and many parents reluctant to give up their child 's organs after they die			1
the girls ' parents allowed a tv crew to film them in hospital in the hope of encouraging more donors			0
the @entity99 documentary is on tuesday at 9pm			0
even with a donor match , @entity2 and @entity11 would not have survived long enough for a transplant if it was not for the @entity12 , which is the size of a small fridge and named after the @entity106 city where it is made			1
the machine moves air in and out of a pumping chamber and pushes blood back into the heart and around the body			0
a cannula is needed to be inserted into the patient 's heart during an operation lasting up to eight hours			0
@entity45 said : ' it took holly 12 days to realise she was no longer attached to a machine after her transplant			2
she stepped outside the room and said mam , i 'm outside on my own , what do i do ? @entity125 : @entity2 can look forward to making new friends thanks to doctors ' just keep walking , i said			0
and she walked so proudly down to the nurses ' station with her head held high and said , look at me i have no @entity12 ! i can walk on my own			0
' we will always be extremely grateful to the staff who helped us through the hardest time of our lives , but we will also be extremely grateful to the family of the donor who made that decision to donate their child 's organs			0
' but despite its life - saving potential , one in four children die waiting for a transplant			1
@entity11 suffered multiple infections and needed four chambers replaced due to clotting , one of which went undetected and caused a stroke			2
children on a @entity12 are given priority on the organ waiting list , with doctors able to transplant a heart up to three times the recipient 's body weigh - meaning youngsters can benefit from an adult 's heart			0
in january , three - month - old @entity160 in @entity161 became the youngest person ever to be treated with a @entity12			0
in december 2010 , two - year - old @entity163 was attached to a @entity12 at @entity13			2
he was kept alive by the artificial organ for 251 days - more than any other child in the @entity166 - before under going a successful heart transplant last year			2
life - saver : the @entity12 machine kept @entity11 and @entity2 alive survived : @entity2 and @entity11 were treated at @entity13			1

@entity11 and @entity171 were kept alive for five and six months respectively while they waited for a donor match
they were attached to the life - saving machine 24 hours a day
their parents spent up to 16 hours a day by their sides
