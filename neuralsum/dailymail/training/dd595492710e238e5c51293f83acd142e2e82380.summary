@entity0 got an early season reminder that even players ranked below 300 can be a handful , and that playing @entity4 is different to playing unofficial exhibition events			2
faced with the pressure of the year 's first @entity7 and an underrated opponent in @entity9 , the world no 6 had life made awkward for him by the unfacied @entity13 before coming through 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 in two hours and 13 minutes at the @entity14			1
the 27 year - old scot now faces @entity17 's @entity16 , who won his first match in five attempts at @entity20 by overcoming @entity22 @entity21 in five sets			1
@entity0 , who had swept all before him at non-ranking events in @entity26 and @entity27 prior to this , struggled to contain his frustration against @entity9 , who had nothing to lose after coming through the qualifying event			1
at times it looked as if he had been expecting an easier ride			0
however , he made clear that was not the case afterwards , saying , ' he made it very difficult for me , he played very aggressively and made it tough			0
i had never seen him play before or hit with him and that made it more tricky			0
he should n't be ranked where he is			0
@entity0 was made to work for his win and was pushed all the way in the third set @entity0 looked comfortable on his serve and did well to win in straight sets ' i have got a tough draw this year and it 's going to be quite a challenge			1
' the invective directed at @entity61 and his player box does not bode well , although he looked fairly sharp a lot of the time , despite having to fight back from being a break down in the third set			0
he won the subsequent tiebreak 7 - 3 and overall served and returned with purpose against someone who showed the strength in depth of the men 's game			1
@entity9 played far better than his world ranking of 317 suggested on the plus side , and if one is looking at what he and @entity61 have been working on during the off season , there seems to be a more deliberate ball toss on his serve and he moved particularly well wide to his forehand side			2
@entity0 was given the small honour of playing the first match ever on the revamped @entity39 , which now seats 7,500 and has been added to by what is proudly termed as the fastest closing roof in @entity17			1
@entity0 's coach @entity61 looked relaxed as the @entity87 no 1 progressed to the second round @entity0 's fiance @entity89 was there to watch her man from the courtside box @entity0 was backed by fans on the @entity94 however it was never likely to be able to show off that capability as it was bright day one of the @entity14 , albeit far removed from the scorching temperatures that marked the opening week twelve months ago			2
he will have been pleased to get off in straight sets and emerge from a match that presented him with everything to lose			0
there is no substitute for playing matches in the biggest events when the pressure is at its most intense .			0

@entity0 beat of @entity13 @entity9 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6
@entity0 was given a good work out by @entity9 who took him to a tie break in the third set
the world no 6 will face @entity17 's @entity16 in the next round
