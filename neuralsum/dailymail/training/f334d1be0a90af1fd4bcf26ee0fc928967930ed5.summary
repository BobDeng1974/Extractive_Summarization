the @entity16 group , who tackle illegal mooring and monitor river bylaws , made the proposal at their latest meeting			2
hostility : staff patrolling the @entity1 , famed for its punting , say they are now working in fear of attack @entity1 bailiff @entity28 revealed that he feels so unsafe that he lives in fear of knife attacks			1
the report said : ' the river bailiff has asked to be issued with a ' stab ' vest given the increase in hostility displayed towards staff			1
' city councillor @entity36 , a member of the @entity16 group , said : ' it was felt that , in terms of a duty of care to staff and to protect them , it was better to be safe than sorry			1
' it 's a sign of a sad time when we have got to think about providing such equipment for a guy who is just doing a job			0
' tensions : despite the idyllic scenery , there has been a worrying rise in antisocial behaviour on the river congestion : part of the antisocial behaviour problem has been the intense rivalry of competing punting companies trouble at the busy tourist attraction in recent years has included heavy congestion , sunken punts , vandalism and a tense rivalry between punt operators			1
fears were also raised over the loutish behaviour of punters , such as urinating in public			1
the meeting heard : ' a live - aboard boater complained a rowing eight came close to their vessel and one of the crew members stood up and urinated openly in front of them at breakfast time			0

' the crew found this very amusing			0
' river manager dr @entity86 is concerned that there is growing frustration between motorised boats and @entity11 's famous rowers			2

' a second report revealed a spate of boats deliberately being set free and house boats being burgled			0
it not only humans that have proved troublesome on the river in recent years			0
