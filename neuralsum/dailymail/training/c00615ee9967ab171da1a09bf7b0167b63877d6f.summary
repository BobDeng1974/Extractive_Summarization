by @entity1 reporter published : 14:55 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 14:56 est , 11 april 2012 the owner of an @entity5 , @entity4 strip - club shut down by city officials after allegations of prostitution and drug trafficking has been arrested for hiring hit - men to kill the local mayor			1
@entity13 agents apprehended 34 - year - old @entity14 after he allegedly contacted an intermediary secretly working with the bureau and promised to pay $ 10,000 each for the murder of mayor @entity18 and @entity20 attorney @entity19			1
reportedly furious that @entity18 and prosecutor @entity19 were blocking his attempts to re-open his @entity24 club , it is alleged that @entity14 , went to the go - between with the intention of having the pair killed			1
@entity24 men 's club co-owner @entity14 who has been arrested as the @entity13 investigates an alleged contract killing plot against the town 's mayor and a @entity20 attorney informing the intermediary that he wanted @entity37 nationals to commit the crimes and then return across the border , the strip - club boss had already had two phone conversations discussing the alleged crimes			1
meeting the person known as ' @entity43 ' at his home last monday , @entity14 checked to see if he was carrying a wire before he confirmed the contract killings			0
instead a sworn affidavit from the @entity13 middle - man provided the evidence needed for a @entity51 style raid on @entity14 at his up - market @entity53 home last monday			2
targeted : mayor @entity18 of @entity5 was allegedly the subject of a contract killing and had a $ 10,000 price tag on his head the unidentified intermediary ’s affidavit said that upon his final meeting with @entity14 he handed him photos and contact information for the people he wanted killed by the @entity37 hit - men he thought he was hiring			1
insistent on using a go - between , the affidavit quoted @entity14 as having given the killing of mayor @entity18 and @entity19 a lot of thought			1
‘ i ca n't just call up my dude and say go hit them , this is too high - profile , ’ said @entity14 in federal documents			0
the contract killing was apparently @entity14 ’s way of resolving a dispute between himself and @entity5 officials over the closure of his @entity24 club on 520 n. @entity82			1
both @entity18 and @entity19 had roles in the stalling of issuing a new license for the club which @entity14 agreed to close temporarily last year after 25 drug violations and 15 alcohol related violations had been logged since may 2008			1
‘ they just jacked me for a year of business and they 're trying to jack me indefinitely , when we had a deal , and they just reneged on it , ’ @entity14 said , according to the affidavit			0
claiming that he was set to lose up to $ 800,000 a year with the closure of the club , @entity14 is being held by @entity101 marshals and scheduled to appear at a detention hearing at 2:30 p.m on friday before @entity101 magistrate judge @entity103			2
officials attached to the case argue that @entity14 should remain in federal custody as he is a flight risk and because of the level of intended violence in the case			0
bone of contention : @entity24 club which has not had its licensed renewed and has been closed for year one of @entity5 ’s last businesses connected with the sex trade , @entity24 club was closed after a deal between the city and the state attorney general 's office			2
city officials named the popular club as rife with drugs , prostitution , aggravated assaults and other criminal activity			0
faced with a trial unless he closed last year , @entity14 was said to be furious that @entity5 police chief @entity126 planned to revoke @entity24 's license to operate as an adult business after @entity14 was accused of filing misleading paper work to the city and condoning sexual acts on the premises			2
attorney @entity19 who was involved in the case against @entity24 and had successfully closed it for a year one of the alleged contract ‘ hits ’ , @entity19 used the testimony of three @entity5 undercover vice-squad members and video clips to build his case			1
the original license @entity14 held expired on february 6 and despite the re-application @entity5 deputy chief @entity142 has still not ruled on the revocation following the drug , alcohol and sex charges			2
one clip being used in the case to remove @entity14 ’s license shows @entity14 himself having sex in the office as a manager sits a few feet away and three other video ’s show dancers rubbing themselves provocatively in front of customers			0
however , mr @entity14 ’s father @entity159 has refuted all charges brought against his son			0
‘ good lord no , ’ answered @entity159 as to whether he believed his son would have sanctioned two contract killings			0
the centre of controversy : @entity5 city officials had claimed that offences related to drugs , alcohol and prostitution had all taken place at the @entity24 club ‘ that is because as far as you can say he was looking forward to re-opening			0
‘ no , he certainly did n’t have any animosity , well , he was n’t happy about it but he certainly did n’t voice any desire to harm anyone about it that ’s for sure			0

@entity186 owner @entity14 stung by @entity13 in undercover operation
wanted to pay @entity37 contract killers to murder @entity5 mayor @entity18 and top @entity20 attorney @entity19
@entity14 blamed both for the continued closure of his popular strip - club which had *numerous* drug and alcohol violations against it
