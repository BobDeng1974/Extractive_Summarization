but mrs @entity6 was upset when the officer gave @entity8 a brutal evaluation of his life prospects , warning him he would ' have to work harder in life to gain people ’s respect ' because of his colour			1
she complained to police and the council about the comment , which she says was : ' because you are not a white @entity11 boy , you are going to have to work harder in life to gain people ’s respect and achieve high things , ' which she claims is racist			1
