by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:51 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 19 november 2013 an 11 - year - old boy found chained to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck is no ' sweet innocent kid ' and likely harmed the bird to provoke the bizarre punishment , his foster brother said today			1
the 20 - year - old , who did n't want to be named , said his adopted parents @entity11 and @entity13 provided a ' loving and caring home ' but the boy has severe psychological issues , including a history of being cruel to animals			1
he said his parents ' punishment , though he did n't condone it , was a last ditch attempt to control the child 's behavior and protect the rest of the household			2
he has been to counseling , he is on numerous heavy medications , but nothing has worked , ' the brother told @entity40			0
@entity13 , an emergency room nurse , and @entity11 , a social worker , have been charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury , false imprisonment and animal cruelty			1
the couple have been jailed and , at a brief court appearance monday , their bond was set at $ 500,000 each			0
the brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to ' shame the child			1
' ' there has to be something going on , between that child and that chicken , ' he said			1
' he either , one , did n't feed it and it died , or two , either he was out there harassing the chicken			2
he may have killed the chicken			1
this child has been known to be cruel to animals			1
' he said the controversial discipline was his father 's doing , as his mother , who would have put a stop to it , was n't home at the time			1
the brother explained the 11 - year - old , who had lived at the home since he was six , was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem , not because he was being mistreated			1
' he would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer , let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw , ' the man , who moved out of the home two years ago , when he turned 18 , told @entity40			2
' he has severe psychological issues			1
' charged : @entity29 was arrested and charged friday after a sheriff happened to stumble across the boy on the porch ' he was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then , throw the lunch box away and say he did n't have lunch for the day			1
' @entity99 deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment			0
but the brother insisted his parents cared for the children , all of whom are adopted except for the 11 - year - old			1
' everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused , that is not accurate			2
you ask all four of the children , they will say they lived in a loving and caring home , ' he said			1
the account contradicts claims from the 11 - year - old 's relatives who say they have tried for years to get @entity122 to look into the allegations of abuse			1
@entity125 were at the house early this week gathering the property 's remaining animals , including an estimated 75 fowl ( chicken , ducks , guineas and peacock ) three horses , three donkeys , two llamas , eight dogs and a hog			1
the news comes after it was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in @entity145 by his foster parents , who were preventing him from running away			1
police in @entity148 have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces - covered house would ' take your breath away ' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and , at one point , was ' purple with cold ' and ' looked pitiful '			1
alleged abuse : @entity30 , pictured , was also arrested and charged with numerous offenses of abuse @entity163 lives on land adjacent to that of the child 's foster parents			1
the pair also have four adopted children aged from eight to 14			2
all five have been placed in care outside @entity172 because @entity11 is a child protective services supervisor for that county 's @entity122			2
she has received extra charges of willful failure to discharge her duty			0
neighbor mr @entity163 said in late july or early august a boy came running to his home ' crying and panicking and said '' mister , can i have something to eat ? '' ' as mr @entity163 ' wife went to fix a sandwich , the other boys arrived			2
' they told me he was the newest one ( and ) said they were going to take him back , ' mr @entity163 told @entity188			0
this boy ' was real small '			2
' he looked the smallest one out of the bunch			0
... we just assumed he was kind of scared , ( being in a ) new house , new area , new siblings , ' said mr @entity163			0
@entity197 , who lives across the street , told @entity199 the five children ' dress like orphans ' and that the 11 - year - old boy ' looked pitiful '			1
another neighbor , who asked not to be named , said a boy appeared on her porch in may 2012 ' purple with cold , with no coat , saying he was hungry '			2
' when asked , he said he had no mother or father and did n't know where he lived , ' she said			0
the woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich			0
dead : this lifeless chicken was found around the neck of the foster child who was handcuffed to the porch of his home in @entity172 , @entity221 , on friday ' it did n’t take him 10 seconds to eat it , ' she said			1

when she told him she would take him home , she said , he answered : ' no. i want to stay here			0
' her daughter called 911 and a sheriff 's deputy came out , spoke with the boy , made a phone call , then told him she 'd take him home			2
' he did n't refuse			0
he just went with her			0
' the neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy had n't been missing more than 30 minutes			2

the smell took your breath away			0
' all the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and @entity269 said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza			0
squalor : authorities have described the @entity275 house as ' terrible ' , covered in feces , urine and garbage , and something ' you would n't want to walk through , much less live in ' disturbing : @entity11 , a child services worker , lives at this property with four adopted children and the 11 - year - old who was the only foster child authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy , who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property , saw the 11 - year - old handcuffed to the porch			1
he approached the house and was confronted by @entity13			0

according to @entity299 , one of the children opened the front door , releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy			0
by the time he had the dogs under control , @entity13 had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house			1

' it 's just shocking , ' captain @entity315 said on saturday			0
' it 's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner			0
' it is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy			1
@entity315 said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation .			0

@entity29 and @entity30 have been charged with *multiple* counts of intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury , false imprisonment and animal cruelty
their 11 - year - old foster child was found handcuffed to their front porch with a dead chicken around his neck on friday
but their 20 - year - old adopted son claims he grew up in ' loving and caring home ' and the boy suffers from severe psychological issues
he said the child had a history of being cruel to animals and probably hurt or killed the chicken , which led to the controversial discipline
