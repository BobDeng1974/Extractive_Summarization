men of the 1st battalion @entity1 were told while serving in @entity2 by @entity3 and @entity4 published : 19:34 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 18:29 est , 5 july 2012 the @entity5 will be left at its weakest since 1750 after @entity6 announced the biggest shake - up for a century			1
despite admitting troops ' morale was ' fragile ' , the defence secretary ploughed ahead with axing some of the most distinguished battalions – including those serving in @entity2			1
the plan will contribute to reducing @entity5 personnel from 102,000 to 82,000 – its lowest level in more than 250 years and just half the 163,000 servicemen it boasted during the @entity19 conflict			2
the number of @entity22 civil servants is as many as 80,000			2
about 50 are attached to the @entity44 the @entity40 on the front line			0
and hundreds of troops serving in @entity47 with the 1st @entity48 were informed they will be merged			1
the cull also hit the historic 2nd battalion the @entity25 , which traces its roots to the battle of @entity30 in 1879 , where seven of its men won @entity55 for their stand against the @entity36			1
in total , 17 major @entity5 units – some dating back more than 300 years – will be lost under the reforms , described by mr @entity6 as a ' vision for the future '			1
but top brass accused him of ' taking a risk ' with @entity35 's security while @entity67 said the reorganisation was a ' military gamble '			1
the 1964 film @entity27 , starring @entity37 as lieutenant @entity71 , dramatised the heroism shown by soldier at the battle iconic : @entity27 starred @entity75 ( pictured ) , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity37 and was narrated by @entity79 the @entity25 , which was created in 2006 by the amalgamation of the @entity81 and the @entity82 , can trace its history back to the defiant stand at @entity30 during the @entity85 – at which it won seven vcs			1
at the time – in 1878 – the unit was known as the @entity89 – or the @entity90			0
that historic regiment , which started life as @entity93 ’s in 1689 , became the @entity89 in 1881 and won many honours in @entity95 and the world wars			0
in @entity98 , the @entity89 ' museum tells the story of @entity30 along with an exhibition of all the @entity55 medals won by the regiment in its long history			1
in the @entity109 , the exploits of the 24th regiment , known by @entity106 as ' the @entity107 ' during the 1879 war are recorded , along with the events surrounding the defence of @entity30 by @entity112 of the @entity113 , the famous event recorded in the 1960s sir @entity75 film @entity27			1
the decision to axe the 2nd battalion means its 640 members based @entity31 in @entity32 face an uncertain future			1
the @entity22 said staff will be merged with the regiment 's @entity117			0
@entity123 mp sir @entity122 told mr @entity6 he would ' go down in history as the man who hammered the @entity5 '			1
the defence secretary announced the @entity5 2020 overhaul yesterday after postponing the cuts for four months			1
the @entity5 will end up at its smallest since 1750 , when it had 78,900 men			1
four infantry units will be disbanded – the @entity131 , which in an earlier incarnation won six @entity86 ' before breakfast ' at @entity134 , and the @entity44 the @entity135 ( @entity136 ) joining the 2 @entity25 and 2 @entity137			0
a fifth , the @entity139 , @entity140 the @entity141 , will be reduced to 120 soldiers performing ceremonial duties at @entity144 and @entity145			0
and critics blasted the decision to save all five @entity149 cap badges – which struggle to recruit enough troops – at the expense of @entity153 ones , calling it a ' shabby political fix ' to avoid handing a propaganda coup to @entity157 's pro-independence nationalists			1
two cavalry units will be lost when the @entity159 merge with the 9th/12th @entity159 and the 1st and 2nd @entity160 are combined			1
the @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 will also be cut			2
the first units will be axed next year			0
mr @entity6 said the changes were ' difficult and challenging ' but were needed to create a ' best - in - class @entity5 '			2
he defended the cuts despite admitting the @entity35 faced an ' increasingly uncertain world '			1

i understand the attachments of the regions and nations to specific units in the @entity5 and the justifiable pride they have in those units			0

while recognising and honouring the golden history , our first priority must be looking resolutely to the future			2

' this is n't just a smaller army , it 's also a less powerful @entity5 in a less influential nation			0
