@entity1 ’s @entity0 were tamed by @entity2 as their @entity4 campaign started with a chastening seven - goal thrashing on friday afternoon			1
four down within 18 minutes and five behind by the break , this was far from the positive start @entity1 wanted in the competition designed to serve as their main preparation for this summer ’s @entity13 defence			1
indeed , it was @entity2 who @entity1 defeated on penalties in last year ’s @entity13 final in @entity17 and they gained a handsome measure of revenge in @entity20 on a friday 13 horror show			1
@entity1 fell to an embarrassing 7 - 0 defeat against @entity2 at the @entity24 tournament @entity27 starlet @entity25 ( right ) scored a hat - trick for @entity2 during his side 's 7 - 0 win @entity1 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 ( @entity37 45 ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 45 ) ; @entity2 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 71 ) ; @entity43 ( @entity44 62 ) subs not used : will @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 booked : @entity34 @entity52 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity53 ( @entity54 55 ) ; @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 45 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 ) ; @entity64 ( @entity65 60 ) , @entity66 ( @entity68 - @entity67 ) , @entity25 subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 scorers : @entity64 5 ; @entity34 ( own goal ) 10 ; @entity62 13 ; @entity25 18 , 39 , 79 ; @entity78 70 @entity80 ’s side trailed inside five minutes when @entity81 ’s @entity64 was played through , held off the challenge of @entity33 and slotted the ball past goalkeeper @entity31			1
things got worse five minutes later when @entity31 , the @entity87 keeper , struck a clearance against his own defender @entity34 and watched as it rebounded back past him into the net			0
it was three to the @entity92 on 13 minutes when the lively @entity64 advanced down the right to the six - yard box and pulled the ball back to @entity96 man @entity62 to poke home			2
@entity1 were shell - shocked and conceded another shortly afterwards			2
once more , @entity64 burst forward on his right flank and crossed for @entity25 , who is on @entity27 ’s books , to volley in			1
the @entity0 at least gained their composure at this point and even started to create some openings of their own			0
@entity105 forward @entity104 got the better of two defenders before drawing a save from @entity92 keeper @entity53			0
on the half - hour , @entity108 ’s @entity43 set up @entity40 , of @entity109 , but his curling effort was pushed clear by @entity53			0
there was just enough time before the break for @entity2 to add a fifth and it was @entity115 again who capitalised			2
the second half was pretty academic , with @entity1 playing only for pride			0
but they could n’t get on the scoresheet and @entity2 added a couple more to really rub it in			0
@entity124 , on as a substitute , scored no 6 and @entity25 completed his hat - trick with an excellent free - kick in the closing stages			1
@entity128 , a 16 - year - old left winger , joined @entity27 from @entity129 last summer and has already featured for their under 18s in domestic competition and the under 19s in the @entity132			2
@entity1 will have to regroup quickly as they take on @entity133 in their second game on sunday afternoon .			0

@entity27 starlet @entity25 scored a hat - trick for @entity2
@entity1 were 4 - 0 down after just 18 minutes and five behind at the break
@entity2 exacted revenge on @entity1 after last year 's @entity13 final in @entity17
