@entity1 legend @entity0 would be disappointed to see @entity2 leave north @entity3 , and believes his troubled times at the club are down to @entity7 's refusal to play him as a striker			1
@entity2 has made just five starts for @entity1 this season since returning from a serious knee injury after seven months on the sidelines			2
and with @entity1 pursuing @entity13 and @entity2 's contract set to run out next summer , @entity0 is worried that the @entity16 could stand to lose a valuable player			1
@entity2 could be on the way out of @entity1 , and @entity16 legend @entity0 says that would be ' a shame ' @entity0 enjoys @entity2 as a player and hinted that he would like to see the winger stay at the club @entity2 started up front for @entity26 against @entity27 on tuesday but his appearances have been limited this year ' it 's a shame for him , and the fact that people are talking about him maybe moving on if someone else comes in makes me quite sad , ' he said			1
' i really like him at @entity1 but he 's got massive decisions to make in the next few months			0
' @entity0 also believes the @entity26 wideman , who was played in a central role for his country in @entity27 on tuesday night , should have been moved into a similar position for his @entity1			2
@entity2 's pace had seen him likened to the @entity16 ' record goalscorer @entity41 , who made a similar positional switch during his time in north @entity3 , but manager @entity7 has only briefly experimented with @entity2 as a striker			2
@entity41 was prolific as a striker for @entity1 after being moved inside from his familiar wide role @entity7 has only briefly used @entity2 up front , and @entity0 says it should have been persisted with @entity49 's @entity13 is an @entity1 target who also has his contract expiring in the near future ' i always believed @entity2 should have been a striker at @entity1 with his pace			1
i thought playing him on the right would last so long and then he would get moved inside , ' @entity0 told goal			0
i 'm not saying he 's the same kind of player as @entity41 by any stretch , but i thought @entity7 would move him inside			0
' i think that 's been to his detriment , because he would have learned a lot more about the game and runs he 'd have to make			0
i 've seen him finish very well when he gets into one - on - one situations			0
