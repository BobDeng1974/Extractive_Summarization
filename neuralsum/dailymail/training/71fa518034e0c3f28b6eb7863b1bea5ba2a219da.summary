by @entity0 , @entity1 qualifier @entity2 upset @entity5 second seed @entity4 to reach the fourth round at a grand slam for the first time in 15 years			1
the former child prodigy is now 32 but rolled back the years with a superb display of power hitting to knock out title contender @entity4 7 - 6 ( 8/6 ) 6 - 2			1
a title winner at 15 and @entity17 semi-finalist by 17 , @entity14 - @entity2 's burgeoning career was derailed by off - court problems			1
upset : @entity2 reacts to knocking out second seed @entity4 game over : @entity4 and @entity2 embrace at the net following their @entity5 third round clash in 1998 , she and her mother and siblings fled their native @entity25 for the @entity26 to escape father and coach @entity28 , who she alleges physically and verbally abused her from a young age			1
although she went on to have her great run at @entity17 in 1999 , beating @entity33 before losing narrowly to @entity34 , @entity14 - @entity2 's success petered out			2
financial problems limited the amount she could play and she contested only two professional matches between 2004 and 2006			0
but @entity2 was determined that her personal misfortune would not stop her playing tennis and in 2007 she began the long road back			0
she has battled away on the lower rungs of the tennis ladder , returning to the grand slam stage in 2010 after a gap of eight years			0
her best run until now came at @entity17 in 2012 when she beat @entity46 on her way to the third round as a qualifier			0
the result will be a major disappointment for @entity4 , who has enjoyed a brilliant season , reaching at least the quarter - finals at the other three grand slams and losing to @entity55 in the @entity57 final			0
there was also disappointment for @entity60 , who served for the match against @entity62 before losing a bizarre contest 6 - 0 0 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7/5 )			1
@entity60 came into the tournament with high hopes after a good run of form and had never lost more than three games in a set against @entity62 before			2
anguish : @entity60 served for the match against @entity62 before losing determined : @entity62 used all her experience to overcome @entity60 at @entity72 the @entity26 's radar was horribly off in the first set - she hit four winners and made 18 unforced errors - but she looked to have decisively turned the match in her favour in the second			2
@entity60 served for the match at 5 - 3 in the decider but could not force a match point and @entity62 came up with two fine points to clinch the tie - break , throwing her racquet into the air and then perhaps unwisely shushing the crowd			2
bizarrely it is the second time @entity60 has lost a match at @entity72 having lost the first set and won the second to love - she was also beaten by @entity89 in 2009			0
@entity14 - @entity2 will play @entity62 in the fourth round			0
it was a day of shocks , and another arrived on @entity93 where 17 - year - old @entity95 @entity94 knocked out sixth seed @entity97 6 - 1 7 - 5			1
teenager : @entity99 , 17 , caused a major upset by ousting sixth seed @entity97 @entity102 : @entity99 will play @entity103 in the fourth round after the @entity104 thrashed @entity105 on form : @entity107 defeated @entity108 after seeing off @entity109 the previous round in her first visit to the last 16 at a grand slam , @entity94 will play eighth seed @entity103 , who dispatched @entity114 ' conqueror @entity105 for the loss of one game			1
@entity107 followed up her victory over fourth seed @entity109 in round two by defeating 28th seed @entity120 6 - 4 6 - 3 .			0
