rings in fossilised pine trees have proven that the world was much warmer than previously thought - with measurements dating back to @entity4 how did the @entity5 grow grapes in northern @entity7 ? perhaps because it was warmer than we thought			1
a study suggests the @entity11 of 2,000 years ago experienced a lengthy period of hotter summers than today			2
@entity15 researchers used data from tree rings – a key indicator of past climate – to claim the world has been on a ‘ long - term cooling trend ’ for two millennia until the global warming of the twentieth century			0
this cooling was punctuated by a couple of warm spells			0
these are the @entity28 , which is well known , but also a period during the toga - wearing @entity5 times when temperatures were apparently 1 deg c warmer than now			1
they say the very warm period during the years 21 to 50ad has been underestimated by climate scientists			0
lead author professor dr @entity37 of @entity38 in @entity39 said : ‘ we found that previous estimates of historical temperatures during the @entity5 era and the @entity44 were too low			1
‘ this figure we calculated may not seem particularly significant , however it is not negligible when compared to global warming , which up to now has been less than 1 deg @entity48 ’ in general the scientists found a slow cooling of @entity51 over 2,000 years , which they attributed to changes in the @entity54 ’s orbit which took it further away from the @entity56 the study is published in @entity58			1
it is based on measurements stretching back to @entity4			1
the finding may force scientists to rethink current theories of the impact of global warming professor @entity37 's group at the @entity68 at @entity38 used tree - ring density measurements from sub-fossil pine trees originating from @entity71 to produce a reconstruction reaching back to 138 bc. in so doing , the researchers have been able for the first time to precisely demonstrate that the long - term trend over the past two millennia has been towards climatic cooling			1
professor @entity37 said : ' such findings are also significant with regard to climate policy , as they will influence the way today 's climate changes are seen in context of historical warm periods			0
’ the annual growth rings in trees are the most important witnesses over the past 1,000 to 2,000 years as they indicate how warm and cool past climate conditions were			2
researchers from @entity15 , @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92 examined tree - ring density profiles			0
in the cold environment of @entity71 , trees often collapse into one of the numerous lakes , where they remain well preserved for thousands of years			0
global cooling : it is the first time that researchers have been able to accurately measure trends in global temperature over the last two millennia the annual growth rings in trees are the most important witnesses over the past 1,000 to 2,000 years as they indicate how warm and cool past climate conditions were the density measurements correlate closely with the summer temperatures in this area on the edge of the @entity110 taiga ; the researchers were thus able to create a temperature reconstruction of unprecedented quality			2
the reconstruction provides a high - resolution representation of temperature patterns in the @entity5 and @entity118 periods , but also shows the cold phases that occurred during the @entity120 and the later @entity121			2
in addition to the cold and warm phases , the new climate curve also exhibits a phenomenon that was not expected in this form .			0

study of *semi-fossilised* trees gives accurate climate reading back to @entity4
@entity54 was warmer in @entity5 and @entity131 than it is now
