by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:37 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:39 est , 27 december 2013 a gene variant that appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in some people can be traced back to @entity7			1
a team of researchers in @entity10 and the @entity11 have conducted the largest genetic study to date in @entity14 populations			1
they discovered that people who carry a higher risk version of the gene are 25 per cent more likely to have diabetes that those who do not			1

the gene variant was found as part of @entity31 ’s ( @entity30 in @entity32 for the @entity33 ) study of 8,000 @entity35 , which sought to find a particular trait among individuals ’ genes			0
people who carry the higher risk version of the gene - @entity41 - thought to have been passed down by ancient ancestors - are 25 per cent more likely to have diabetes			1
people who inherited copies of the variant from both their patents are 50 per cent more likely to have diabetes , according to the study published in @entity51			1
@entity52 has been discovered in up to half of people with recent @entity55 ancestry , including @entity35 and around one fifth of @entity57			1
however , it is rare in populations from @entity60 and @entity24			0
the elevated frequency of this risk gene in @entity35 could account for as much as 20 per cent of the populations ’ increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes - the origins of which are not well understood			2

changing the amount of the @entity41 protein alters the amount of a type of fat implicated in the risk of diabetes			2
the findings of the study suggest @entity74 could be linked to the movement of a mystery metabolite that affects fat levels in cells - which can boost the risk of type 2 diabetes			0
‘ to date , genetic studies have largely used samples from people of @entity60 or @entity108 ancestry , which makes it possible to miss culprit genes that are altered at different frequencies in other populations , ’ said co-author @entity98 , an associate professor of medicine at @entity100 and an assistant physician at the @entity102 at the @entity103			0
‘ by expanding our search to include samples from @entity10 and @entity14 , we ’ve found one of the strongest genetic risk factors discovered to date , which could illuminate new pathways to target with drugs and a deeper understanding of the disease			2
' the researchers wanted to understand what they describe as the ‘ unusual frequency pattern ’ for the variant of @entity52 and partnered with @entity127 of the @entity128 to discover that the variant is found in a newly sequenced neanderthal genome			0
‘ analyses indicate that the higher risk version of @entity52 was introduced into modern humans through mixing with @entity7 , ’ according to the study			1
the researchers ' ultimate goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic pathway to find new drugs for treating diabetes			0
@entity141 , a medication that blocks the production of cholesterol in the body and is used to treat type - 2 diabetes , is pictured inheriting a gene from @entity7 ancestors is not unusual , as around 2 per cent of the sequences present in all modern humans outside of @entity24 were inherited from @entity7 who lived in what is now @entity60 and western @entity153 , between 400,000 and 30,000 years ago			1
however , scientists have only relatively recently realised the advantages and disadvantages of inherited genetic material from @entity7			2
@entity158 , of the @entity159 in @entity160 and co-author of the study , said : ‘ one of the most exciting aspects of this work is that we 've uncovered a new clue about the biology of diabetes			0
’ ‘ we are now hard at work trying to figure out what is being transported … and what steps lead to the development of type 2 diabetes , ’ he added			0
