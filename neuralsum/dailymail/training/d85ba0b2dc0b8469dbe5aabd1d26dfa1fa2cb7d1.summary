@entity1 's mother today spoke of her anger at @entity4 police after discovering that they had a chance to catch her daughter 's killer years before he murdered her			1
indisputable dna evidence has emerged that links @entity12 , currently serving a life sentence for the 2005 murder of 18 - year - old @entity15 in @entity16 , to a rape and two sex assaults in the @entity19 in 2003			1
a @entity20 was jailed for the crimes in 2005 without forensic evidence			1
his lawyer strongly believes he was wrongly convicted			0
tragic : @entity24 ( right ) has expressed her anger at the @entity4 police , who she believes could have apprehended @entity12 before he murdered her daughter , @entity15 ( left ) , if they 'd used dna evidence @entity24 says she is dismayed at the thought that if the @entity4 authorities had investigated the case more thoroughly , her daughter might still be alive			1
she told @entity34 : ' i am absolutely appalled			0
an innocent man has spent 11 years of a 16 year sentence in prison for a crime he did not do			1
' i feel very strongly that if the @entity4 authorities had done their jobs properly , my @entity40 would be alive			2
' he did not assault those three women in @entity4 - @entity40 's killer did			2
he is someone 's son and he is locked up for something he did n't do			0
' the man serving time for the attacks in @entity4 is 41 - year - old @entity50 der @entity51			1
he 's served 11 years of a 16 - year sentence for the crimes , despite forensic evidence linking @entity55 to the rape emerging almost eight years ago , after @entity57 sent his dna to police forces across @entity61			1
official documents – seen by @entity34 – show that @entity58 found on the @entity4 rape victim in an examination straight after the attack , match a dna profile for @entity55 on @entity57 's @entity68 database			1
dna evidence has emerged linking @entity12 ( left ) , serving life for the 2005 murder of @entity1 , to a rape and two sex assaults in the @entity19 in 2003 that @entity50 der @entity51 ( right ) was jailed for yet @entity4 authorities refuse to accept the miniscule 54 million - to - one chance that a dna profile from the sex attack did not match one of @entity55 supplied to @entity57 by @entity79			1
they have requested a fresh dna sample from @entity55 so more tests can be carried out - before they release @entity50			1
in april this year a @entity4 court sent an international letter of request to the @entity86 requesting a saliva sample from @entity55 to confirm the dna match as ' a matter of urgency			1
' in the event of @entity55 refusing to supply a profile , the court has asked that the @entity4 rape dna sample is run through the @entity95 to compare with genetic codes held on @entity55			1
but @entity50 's lawyers say they have heard nothing since then and @entity50 is now facing the prospect of another five years in a @entity4 jail for a crime he did not commit			1
@entity50 is now urging the @entity104 government to intervene and hand over the dna so his conviction can be quashed			0
@entity24 said : ' when the dna was found on @entity40 it was sent to @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity4 and all over			1
' if the @entity4 police and judges had done the same , they would have got him			1
' if they had done their work properly , they would have taken proper dna from the three victims in 2003 and done what we did			2
it gets me choked thinking about it ... even saying that thing 's name			0
' she added : ' i have campaigned so much about dna and the national database			0
to me , this is all about the dna			0
@entity55 was caught nine months after 18 - year - old @entity130 's murder when @entity58 taken from him after a minor pub scuffle was matched to the crime ' it can incriminate people but it can also eliminate people			2
' we are born with a birth certificate , we have a national insurance number and a passport number - why ca n't we all have our dna taken at birth too ? ' this would not have happened			0
my child would still be here			0
' @entity55 was living in @entity144 , on the @entity19 , when the @entity4 victim was raped in august 2003 in startling similar circumstances to @entity15 's murder in @entity16 , @entity148			1
@entity4 court documents , obtained by @entity34 , describe how in the early hours of the 10 august 2003 , two women were robbed and sexually assaulted in the street in @entity144 , southern @entity4			2
the attacker then carried on his crime spree – targeting a third female victim who was walking along the street in he @entity19 town at around 4:30am			0
he leapt on her , hit her several times before throwing her on the floor and raping her			0
the case bears chilling similarities to @entity55 's rampage on september 25 , 2005 - the night stunning blonde model @entity40 was stabbed to death and raped			1
after downing drinks and snorting cocaine with friends in @entity16 , @entity55 is believed to have attacked a female motorist and stolen her mobile phone			1
he then watched @entity40 being dropped home by her boyfriend @entity171 at around 4.10am before stabbing her in the neck and chest and having sex with her as she lay dead on her doorstep			0
@entity50 's lawyers say their client is innocent of the @entity4 crimes and was mistakenly convicted solely on ' inconsistent ' statements from the victims who identified him from photos			2
he was convicted solely on eyewitness testimony - no dna or fingerprints linked @entity50 to the crimes			0
it is believed @entity50 may have been the victim of mistaken identity as he bears a striking resemblance to the @entity55 – with the same brown curly hair and thick eyebrows			0
in 2007 , his lawyer in @entity4 discovered that @entity58 found on the rape victim ' was compatible ' with that of @entity55 's dna profile on @entity57 database			1
but despite years of legal wrangling , the @entity4 courts said they would not order a retrial or acquit @entity50 until they receive a saliva sample from @entity55 – so that his dna can be tested more throughly alongside the rape victim 's			1
@entity1 on her 18th birthday in @entity203 with boyfriend @entity171 so far @entity55 has not given this sample so @entity50 's last hope is that the @entity86 agrees to share @entity55 's dna profile from the @entity104 's national database with the @entity4 authorities			1
@entity50 's lawyer in @entity4 @entity210 , told @entity34 : ' we are waiting for the @entity104 authorities to answer to this request , meanwhile @entity50 is in prison for a crime that all the evidence shows he has not committed			2
i requested the suspension of the sentence to the @entity220 , which was not granted because the court did not accept my request			0
' the court in @entity144 , which is leading the case of dna and other proceedings , is working flawlessly , but we are in the hands of the @entity104 authorities , which are in no hurry to forward any dna testing of @entity55 to the @entity4 courts			1
' he added : ' this conviction was based solely on the statements of victims through photographic reconnaissance and recognition in the trial , without any evidence to dna or fingerprints on the scene			0
' despite the inconsistencies in the statements of victims and witnesses who claimed to have witnessed one of the assaults from a balcony , the court sentenced for these crimes			0
' @entity50 , meanwhile , said he has had to endure ' years of torment ' while serving his sentence in @entity252 prison , @entity253			0
a @entity20 charity named the @entity255 has been campaigning for @entity50 's release			2
@entity55 was caught nine months after 18 - year - old @entity40 's murder when @entity58 taken from him after a minor pub scuffle was matched to the crime			2
he was jailed for life and told he must serve at least 34 years behind bars			2
the chef was a serial sex offender and detectives have long believed he is responsible for more sex attacks and even murders			0
at age 16 he was charged with indecent assault after holding a woman a knifepoint and fondling her breasts			0
just a year later he was jailed for six months after attacking a mum - of - three			0
at his murder trial , a @entity274 woman gave evidence about how @entity55 had stabbed and raped her at her home in @entity278 , @entity109 in 1998			2
campaign : @entity24 wants the dna of every @entity104 citizen to be added to a national database as soon as they 're born the killer 's dna matches that left at the scene of a sexual assault in 2001 , where he is believed to have masturbated in front of a woman in a telephone booth			2
@entity55 has also been a prime suspect in one of the notorious unsolved murder cases in @entity109 - the @entity296 killings between 1996 and 1997 , as it is believed he was in the area at the time of the killings			0
the @entity86 has so far declined to comment on the case .			0

@entity24 has spoken of her anger over the work of @entity4 police
she said they missed a chance to arrest the man who killed her daughter in @entity16 in 2005
dna evidence emerged linking @entity12 to the sex assaults carried out in @entity4 in 2003
however , a @entity20 has spent 11 years behind bars for the attacks after he was jailed on eye witness testimony
@entity319 says forensic evidence would have led to @entity55 's arrest
