@entity1 technical director @entity0 has vowed his track squad will be ready for the @entity3 in two years despite playing second fiddle to @entity5 at the @entity6			1
since @entity8 ruled the velodrome at @entity10 they have slipped back , disappointing at the @entity11 in @entity12 while @entity5 were well ahead of the home nations in @entity14 - topping the medal table with seven golds and 20 in total			1
@entity20 's @entity19 team managed nine overall , with golds for @entity23 and @entity24 , as well as two wins for @entity26 and @entity27 in the para-sport tandem rides			1
top dog : @entity0 grabs a hold of sir @entity31 in the @entity32 in @entity14 it 's gold ! again ! @entity24 poses with her gold medal at @entity35 to add to her @entity37 double close : @entity38 ( silver ) and @entity40 ( bronze ) could n't quite beat @entity42 as home nations dominated the @entity45 tally was boosted by five medals for @entity47 , three for @entity49 and one silver for the @entity51 's @entity50 , but there was no escaping the formidable statement laid down by @entity5 and 11 - medal @entity54			1
@entity20 , though , has vowed to get his riders to peak performance for 2016			2
' ultimately there were some dominant performances from the @entity5 and the @entity54 which you would expect knowing the importance of this event to them , which i do being an @entity5 myself , ' said @entity20 , now heading up @entity1 since sir @entity66 stepped down			1
' but we know how to get it right			0
we 've been there and done that			0
' we came here to represent @entity19 and to win and i think , given where we were at this year 's @entity11 , we 've done @entity19 proud			1
' there are a lot of positives going forward , as well as some riders who did n't perform as well as they 'd have liked			0
' but there 's no doubt we will be ready			2
whether we 'll win in @entity3 , i do n't know , but we will be ready			2
' we have the ' @entity79 ' by january 1			0
from january we 'll really nail our focus on everything about @entity3 and from this competition we 've learned a lot			0
' i do n't feel like there is a lot we can criticise here			0
' not well : @entity86 said he was ' shattered ' and felt ' terrible ' after losing in the men 's sprint final unlucky : @entity19 's @entity86 could not beat @entity54 's @entity89 but settled for @entity6 silver the overall picture was lifted by @entity42 's thrilling points race gold on the final day at the sir @entity94 - heading up a @entity45 one , two , three in front of @entity49 ' @entity38 and @entity47 's @entity40			1
@entity20 denied the double @entity37 champion , who had been struggling with a kidney infection , had spared the squad 's blushes with her late success but was effusive in his praise for the 22 - year - old			1
' i would n't say it saved face , it just showed when it matters the great ones step up , ' he said			2
' expectation is one of the things that kills @entity24 at times			2
she finds it tough , she thinks the crowd expects			0
she was putting too much pressure on herself			0
' i just said to her " it 's all about @entity3 for you , have some fun "			0
gold : @entity19 's @entity23 came out on top in the 3,000m individual pursuit cycling final unbelievable : the 25 - year - old won an @entity37 gold in the women 's team pursuit and did so in @entity14 ' the different between @entity24 winning and losing is whether she is smiling or not			1
you saw that little girl bend her back down the straight and that 's the difference between good and great			0
' look at our big players ( double silver medallist ) @entity86 , @entity42 ... they 're not million miles away			2
' having them on board and heading in the right direction is good			0
' tough competition : the @entity5 and @entity54 have both outshone the @entity140 in @entity14			1

@entity54 also *bagged* 11 medals in the @entity32
