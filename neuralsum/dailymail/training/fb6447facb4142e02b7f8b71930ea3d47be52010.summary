@entity0 , 33 , from @entity1 in @entity3 's south east , conquered her battle with depression on the surface , there was nothing wrong with @entity0			1
she was 29 years old , had a supportive husband , two beautiful young children and an established career in the media			1
but every day ms @entity0 was fighting the desire to kill herself			1
she first realised something was seriously wrong when someone she knew committed suicide and her first thought was ' how did they do it ? ' ' then i started googling to find out more about how she had done it and i think that was the first time i thought " hang on @entity0 , this is not cool " , ' ms @entity20 told @entity26			1
' but there was something about that point , i was in such a dark place that i thought if someone else can do it i can too			0
' her husband @entity33 noticed ms @entity0 was different , but she was too ashamed to talk to him about her depression or tell him how extreme it had gotten			1
' i guess i did n't want to say it out loud , i felt like " what 's wrong with me , how can i even be having these thoughts ? " ' it had been six months of numbness , with ms @entity0 going through the motions at work and taking care of her children without really feeling present			1
then one day at work a little @entity47 chat icon popped up on her computer screen			2
the idea of leaving her young children without a mother was the only thing stopping her ' hey , how are you today ? ' it read			2
it was her friend @entity60 , who she had been close friends with in her early 20s , but had lost touch with since having children			2
at first ms @entity0 gave short , cheery but dishonest answers			1
' i 'm fine , ' she would reply			0
but ms @entity60 was persistent , and kept checking in with ms @entity0 every day			1
' it was pretty random , but if you ask her now she just says she felt like something was n't right , ' she said			0
eventually ms @entity0 ' replies became more honest			1
in the middle of her depression ms @entity0 ' old friend @entity60 asked her how she was out of the blue over @entity47 chat she lied at first , but they kept chatting and over the next four months ms @entity0 eventually told her friend about her suicidal thoughts ' because she was a chat icon it just felt safer , ' she said			1
' i think i just started saying things like , actually i 'm finding things a bit challenging , sometimes i just feel really flat and i do n't want to get out of bed			2
' before long she had become brutally honest , and would say things like : ' i want to die the only thing that 's stopping me is how it will affect my children '			2
ms @entity0 said up until that point , the idea of leaving her young children without a mother had been the only thing stopping her from acting on her suicidal thoughts			1
' my mum died of cancer when i was four , so i was very aware of what that feels like			0
' but one night , about four months after ms @entity0 and ms @entity60 first started chatting , she had a dark dream			1
@entity0 pictured with author and tv presenter @entity103			2
ms @entity0 is a radio host and tv presenter ' in my dream it was almost like i was making a strategy to commit suicide , ' she said			2
' something was there telling me " you can write them a letter explaining that mummy 's mind is sick "			0
' the next day , she spoke to ms @entity60 and told her all about it			2
' i was almost excited because finally i had a plan , and i had a way out , ' she said			0
with her friend 's support , ms @entity0 eventually sought counselling and conquered her battle with depression this was the most serious that ms @entity20 had ever been , and ms @entity60 knew it was time to take action			1
' she called my husband and booked me in to see someone , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' they were all things she was suggesting for ages but she just took the action			0
' ms @entity0 started seeing a counsellor , kept talking with her friend , and slowly her suicidal thoughts started to diffuse			1
' it takes a lot of energy to push through but i just kept pushing through , ' she said			0
' i guess with her encouragement i felt like i had a renewed determination			0
' i know it might sound weird but i know she had a lot of people praying for me , and it just slowly started to lift			0
' she started living a healthier , more active lifestyle and started choosing to banish negative thoughts from her head			0
in july 2012 , after more than a year of counselling , it was her 31st birthday and ms @entity0 was sitting at a caf√© with some of her closest girlfriends overlooking the beach at @entity156 when it struck her that she was feeling really positive and strong on the inside			2
' that was the first time i thought wow , i actually made it out , i might be on the other side , ' she said			0
now 33 , she is sharing her story ahead of @entity161 on thursday in the hope that she will inspire others who are battling with depression			1
' i actually want them to know that they can get better , that it 's not permanent , ' she said			0
' people say you 'll always struggle with it and i actually do n't believe that , i think you can get 100 per cent healed			0
' now 33 , she is sharing her story ahead of @entity172 on thursday in the hope that she will inspire others who are battling with depression she also hopes to inspire those who suspect a friend or relative is suffering from depression , because it was so important for her to have someone constantly checking in she also hopes to inspire those who suspect a friend or relative is suffering from depression , because it was so important for her to have someone constantly checking in			1
' once she cottoned on to what i was going through that she continued to follow up , ' ms @entity0 said			2
' now that i 'm out of it i feel like that was really clear and strategic , but at the time i was in such a cloud that i was n't really aware			0
' her advice is to simply start a conversation			0
' make it a safe space for them to be able to talk about how they 're feeling , ' she said			0
' and be patient , even though sometimes it can be frustrating			0
' eventually they will talk if you keep creating the space			0
