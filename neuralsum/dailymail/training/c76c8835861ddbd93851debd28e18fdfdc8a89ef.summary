@entity0 is used to being in nets - but @entity3 's no 1 is not usually kitted out in pads , batting gloves and helmet			1
the @entity8 keeper was pictured at @entity9 ( not that one ) on friday wearing cricket gear as he batted at a promotional event			2

@entity0 - who was a promising schoolboy cricketer - in the nets at @entity9 @entity19 talks to hart ( left ) and the @entity8 wicketkeeper in a @entity3 top or maybe he was trying on the protective clothing in preparation for facing the likes of @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 on sunday			1
earlier this week @entity0 said @entity3 have nothing to worry about despite their three - match winless spell			2
he said : ' this is one of those difficult patches we 've gone through many a time and as he pointed out , last season we had less points and were in a worse position ( at this stage ) and we won the league			0
