by @entity0 a woman who turned down a marriage proposal from a well - to - do suitor was shocked when he handed a bill of more than £ 115,000 for everything he claims to have spent on her			2
single mother @entity8 , 42 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , says she and 65 - year - old @entity11 were never romantically involved			1
but it seems he felt differently about their relationship , claiming she led him on to extract money from him to fund @entity18 classes , shopping trips and even cosmetic surgery			2
he says she led him on but she insists that the pair were never more than good friends a tearful mr @entity11 told @entity27 's @entity26 : ' this @entity8 has just destroyed every thought of humanity that i 've had for other people			1
' ms @entity8 met mr @entity11 four years ago when she began teaching him dance			1
the pair became good friends , with mr @entity11 taking her for dinner and visiting her home regularly			1
but things between them turned sour when he asked for her hand in marriage - and she turned him down			2
now he has handed her an itemised bill outlining every single penny he ever gave her or spent on her behalf , which amounts to a hefty au $ 200,000 ( £ 116,638 )			0
fully itemised : mr @entity11 claims he loaned ms @entity8 money to pay for things including @entity18 classes , shopping trips , dental appointments , tupperware , birthday parties and even a tummy tuck and breast implants ms @entity8 said things ' took a turn for the worse ' after rejecting the proposal from mr @entity11 mr @entity11 says the payments - of which he has kept careful records and include things like dental appointments , @entity59 and even birthday parties for her children - were all loans			1
and he accuses her of playing on his emotions to get more cash out of him			2
on one occasion , he claims , she asked him to lend her money she needed for emergency surgery			0
but when he went to visit her in the hospital , he found that she had got breast implants and a tummy tuck			0
ms @entity8 tells a different story			1
she insists that despite one loan of au $ 25,000 ( £ 14,580 ) , the rest was given to her out of kindness			2
she says much of the money he has asked her to return paid for unsolicited gifts , and she flatly denies asking him for the money for her cosmetic surgery			0
furthermore , she says that she worked as his office assistant for four years and never received a penny for her time			0
' at the end of the day things took a turn for the worse when i said no to getting married to him , ' she said			0
she believes his billing her for the money is his way of getting revenge for the rejection			0
@entity96 hearted : mr @entity11 met ms @entity8 when she was his dance teacher			1
now , he says , due to the stress and upset that she has caused him , he can never dance again whatever the truth , it is clear that mr @entity11 has been deeply hurt by what 's happened			1
he says that , because of all the stress it 's caused , he will never dance again			1
' i 've probably still got the ability within , physically			0
mentally i still have the ability , ' he said			0
' but , emotionally , it 's just not there any more			0

@entity8 says she and @entity11 were only ever good friends
but he says she led him on to get him to loan her more and more cash
now he says the stress of the ' break up ' means he *'ll* never dance again
