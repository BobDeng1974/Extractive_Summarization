when @entity1 arrives back at @entity2 for the first time in four years it is sure to be a bittersweet occasion for the former @entity6 captain			1
the memories will come flooding back of his five cup finals as an @entity11 midfielder that ended with the @entity11 players being showered in champagne and drenched in adulation			2
there was a time when @entity1 dreamed life would always be like this ; that his next trip to mount @entity21 would be to add to those two @entity22 and three @entity23 wins secured under @entity24			1
@entity25 midfielder @entity1 shoots at goal during a match against @entity28 last month yet those aspirations ended abruptly when the economics of the madhouse behind the scenes at @entity11 intersected with cold hard reality and @entity6 plunged into the financial abyss in 2012			1
when @entity1 returns to the city to skipper @entity36 in a friendly with @entity38 next wednesday night , he knows he could face a hostile reception from the @entity6 fans in the crowd who remain raw about the way their on - field leader walked out when the going got tough			1
yet with no clarity on what the future held for the club under @entity50 , @entity1 was one of several leading players who opted to move on rather than remain to usher in the new era under @entity50			1
while @entity1 takes no personal pleasure from vindication , time has shown his switch to high - flying @entity25 to be a shrewd move , as @entity6 have , by contrast , stumbled between alternating humiliations and crises over the last three years			1
and while the 30 - year - old would understands any animosity , he hopes the fans realise he was left with no other realistic choice			2
@entity1 ( centre ) lifts the @entity22 trophy after @entity6 beat @entity67 1 - 0 in the 2009 final at @entity2 ‘ i ’m really looking forward to the match against @entity38 , ’ said @entity1 , who won three @entity70 titles and was a @entity71 between 2008 and 2012			1
‘ i ’ve always wanted to get back up the road to catch a game but with the number of fixtures we have nowadays i have n’t managed			0
‘ i ’ve fond memories from the majority of my appearances at @entity2 and without doubt , i always hoped i ’d play there a few more times with @entity6			1
when you enjoy as much success as we did in finals , you clearly want to continue in the same vein			0
‘ we always seemed to do well in the cup competitions but none of us – whether you were a fan or a player – could have foreseen what would happen at the club			0
‘ when you play football , you do n’t really have your mind on anything else but with the publicity @entity6 get , we started to get away from that			1
‘ when the new people came in , we did n’t know who we were dealing with and there was no dialogue in terms of telling us which direction the club was going in			0
‘ we never heard from the new owners about how they wanted to take the club forward or what their ambitions were for the next four or five years			2
@entity1 ( centre ) goes flying after being fouled during @entity36 's match against the @entity112 last year ‘ we did n’t even hear how the next six months might pan out			1
there were no conversations had with us at all and it was an impossible situation for everybody			0
i did n’t ever get a phone call to say what the plans were or what the aims of the club were to try to progress			0
‘ i was the captain at the time so if i was n’t getting a call , it ’s fair to say i do n’t think anyone else would have been either			1
‘ it was difficult because nobody really knew what sanctions were going to be applied and if we were going to be relegated or not			0
we were put in a position where we had to make a decision on our futures without knowing what the future might hold in store			0
‘ we had to make choices without knowing anything and the biggest thing from the club was there was a lack of communication so we did n’t know which way it was going			0
‘ i ’m sure there will still be a few people who are unhappy with the way players left but we ’ve seen a lot of things unravel in the last couple of years			2
hindsight is a wonderful thing and everybody can now see the effect the new people had after they came in			0
‘ maybe the fans can start to see where we were coming from and how we looked at it a bit better because of that			0
’ @entity1 ( right ) celebrates with his @entity6 team - mates after the @entity11 club won the 2011 @entity23 final as @entity6 struggle , @entity1 has been a key player in @entity25 ’s challenge for a @entity165 place this season			1
he has tended to keep his own counsel on the thorny issue of @entity6 but when he joined @entity25 , technically as a free agent , he pushed succeeded for the @entity171 ’s club to pay @entity6 a fee			1
these days he just hopes the damage of three years of mismanagement at @entity11 can by repaired			2
‘ it is difficult to say anything in the media about it because you ’re never going to come across the right way in everybody ’s eyes , ’ the 71 - capped @entity175 said			0
‘ it was obviously a difficult situation at the time but whenever i played , i always gave 100 per cent and i loved my time at @entity6			1
‘ i ’ve got nothing but good memories of the fans , who were excellent with me and any supporters i ’ve met since have only been positive			0
‘ at the time , a lot of things were said in the heat of the moment but over time , i think people have been able to see we had to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families			2
@entity1 ( right ) poses with @entity6 manager @entity197 after winning the @entity198 for september 2011 ‘ for me , as an international player at 27 as i was then , i wanted to play at the highest level and i had to take everything into consideration			1
‘ as we did n’t have any real direction at @entity6 we were being made aware of , we wanted to know what was happening but got nothing			1
‘ when i joined the club at first , there was no need to have that conversation because we simply went into every competition looking to win it			0
the fans demanded that , as did the players , but things changed and i hope @entity6 can get back to that soon			2
‘ i ’ve always wanted to get back to @entity11 to see a game and if it was n’t for what happened , we could potentially all still be there just now			0
‘ it ’s not like we were all angling for moves			0
at the time , we had a great dressing room and had had a lot of success over a number of years			2
there was no real need for any of us to look elsewhere and it was really unfortunate things went the way they did			0
