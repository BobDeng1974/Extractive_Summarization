@entity0 are finally starting to dream of @entity2 after manager @entity3 claimed that his side is stronger than his @entity6 team which finished seventh			1
in the 2006 - 07 season @entity3 's @entity6 found themselves third by the turn of the year , but defeat to @entity9 on @entity10 was followed by another three games without a win and the team ended up finishing seventh			1
but the @entity0 boss considers the @entity0 side he has at his disposal is in a better position than that @entity6 team			1
@entity20 ( centre ) earned @entity0 a point against @entity23 last weekend @entity3 has led @entity0 to a top - four spot going into the busy @entity26 schedule @entity3 believes @entity0 are better than his @entity6 side that finished seventh in 2006 - 07 ' we were flying at @entity6 at that time and were very close to getting where none of us expected , ' @entity3 said			1
' the prospects we have now is that this is a bigger squad than that one and has more strength in depth than this one			0
it has not quite got the experience but we have a lot of strength in depth and in the deeper end of the squad we have a lot of good players to step in when needed			0
' that was not the case at @entity6			2
we had a strong 14 or 15 but nothing more than that			0
that is why it never lasted at @entity6 , sadly			2
' the 60 - year - old is not allowing himself to get too carried away with the club sitting in fourth going into the busy festive period			1
they host @entity55 on saturday then have tough matches against @entity57 and @entity58			2
@entity59 was @entity6 's leading scorer the season @entity3 led them to seventh with 11 league goals @entity20 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates after his goal brought his side on level terms @entity3 is refusing to get carried away by his side 's impressive start tot he season asked if maintaining a place in the top four was possible , @entity3 replied : ' we do n’t think that is the case at the moment – we ’ll cross that bridge when @entity26 is over as it can all change so quickly			1
' being a manager who predicts what might or might not be is very dangerous because you get times where you do n’t get beaten for six games like @entity81 and now he is back in losing form because of injuries , particularly with his goalkeeper			0
' likewise , @entity85 have lost five on the trot			0
there are swings and roundabouts in this game that is all so unpredictable			0
there is no good spouting off what you might or might not do because it might leap back and kick you right in the goolies			0

@entity6 finished seventh in 2006 - 07 under the *stewardship* of @entity3
@entity0 have exceeded expectation this season and are currently fourth
