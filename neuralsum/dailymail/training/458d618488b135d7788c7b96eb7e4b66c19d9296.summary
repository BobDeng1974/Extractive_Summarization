millions of @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 will be charged £ 10 to come to @entity3 , under plans set out by @entity5 to pay for extra border staff			1
shadow home secretary @entity7 said 1,000 extra border guards could be hired by charging 5.5 million visitors from 55 countries – including more than 2 million from the @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2			1
currently visitors from a host of friendly countries can travel to @entity3 to work , study or go on holiday without a visa			1
shadow home secretary @entity7 said @entity5 would introduce a £ 10 charge on millions of oversees visitors but @entity5 want to include these countries in the government ’s ‘ electronic visa waiver ’ scheme – a system of fast - track permission to enter the @entity3 – charging each visitor £ 10			1
currently only the @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 are covered by the programme – which allows visitors into @entity3 for up to six months			1
the @entity30 have today attacked the @entity5 proposal – claiming that bringing the @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 into the visa - waiver scheme would cost millions in unnecessary bureaucracy			1
the £ 10 charge is a similar sum to what the @entity0 charges @entity3 to go to the @entity37 on holiday			2
@entity5 said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to @entity3			1
regular increases in the cost of general visas since 2010 - from £ 68 to £ 83 - had not resulted in reduced visitor numbers from countries not benefiting from waiver arrangements , aides said			2
as many as 5.5 million travellers a year will be subject to the new fee - more than two in five of those from @entity0 , with @entity1 and @entity2 the next largest groups			1
mrs @entity7 said that , under a @entity5 government , 1,000 extra immigration staff would be recruited to protect @entity3 's porous borders ‘ @entity56 has got worse in the last five years , ’ ms @entity7 said in a speech			1
‘ under @entity58 , basic checks are just not being done , and that is undermining confidence in the whole system			0
‘ the number of people stopped and turned away at the border has halved			0
a smaller proportion of people absconding at the border are being found			0
and we recently discovered 175,000 failed asylum seekers may not be removed because the @entity70 has ' limited resources '			0
’ @entity58 has claimed @entity5 's visa - waiver charge would only hire 59 extra border guards she pointed to a ‘ serious and growing problem ’ of immigrants taking increasingly desperate steps to get to the @entity3 from @entity77 , including ‘ awful cases of young men camping by the roadside then leaping onto the wheel arches of passing lorries , only to be crushed and killed ’			1
addressing the wider issue , she said : ‘ too often the debate about immigration becomes polarised and unhealthy			0
‘ on the one hand we now have an arms race of rhetoric involving the @entity30 and @entity90 over immigration			0
@entity90 are exploiting peoples ' fears , fuelling anxiety and division , and @entity95 is racing to catch up			0
‘ on the other hand some people seem to think talking about immigration at all is a problem and they dismiss people 's genuine concerns			0
‘ both sides shout at each other			0
and most people do n't agree with either of them			0
‘ in a shouting match , sensible voices are sometimes not heard			0
that 's why @entity5 needs to set out practical reforms as part of a sensible debate on the changes we need			2
’ @entity5 wants to convert all visa waiver arrangements to the electronic version introduced this year for passport holders from the @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 for visa - free stays of up to six months			1
home secretary @entity58 said @entity5 's proposed charge would apply to only around 230,300 people , and could pay for only 59 border staff			2
‘ even before @entity7 's speech , this announcement has unravelled completely , ’ she said			0
‘ @entity5 are pretending they can hire 1,000 more immigration staff when their funding model would raise enough money for only 59 new staff members			2
and as their secret spending review contains plans to cut the @entity129 budget , they are being especially dishonest			0
‘ and what 's more , by relaxing the government 's immigration reforms , @entity5 would take @entity3 backwards and risk a surge in both legal and illegal immigration			1
‘ this disastrous policy launch shows @entity5 are n't remotely ready for the responsibility of government			2
