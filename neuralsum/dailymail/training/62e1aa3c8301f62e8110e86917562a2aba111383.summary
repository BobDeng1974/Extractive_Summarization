by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 18 july 2013 a former @entity2 police officer has lost his disability pension after footage emerged showing him wrestling and chasing monster trucks on a reality tv show			0
@entity8 started receiving monthly payouts of $ 5,808.61 - nearly $ 70,000 a year - in 2010 , claiming he had sustained a leg injury while working for @entity12 police			1
but doctors have now concluded that his disability no longer exists after @entity15 and the @entity16 discovered footage of him taking part in @entity21 's @entity20			1
and in yet another twist , it has emerged that the police officer was approved for the tax - free pension even though he had been indicted just one month earlier on receiving stolen goods charges			1
he claimed he had a leg injury but on the show he was filmed running and wrestling @entity8 resigned from the police force in october 2010 , three months after he was indicted			1
the charges stemmed from stolen jewelry he accepted while working at @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity41 , a gold - buying service which he co-owned			2
he was behind the counter when the thieves brought the loot to the store and @entity8 asked few questions before paying around $ 1,000 for the bag of jewelry , the watchdog reported			1
the day after the burglary , investigators went to the store to ask about the items and @entity8 denied the youngsters had been at the store			2
however , the store had been under surveillance by @entity41 police , who suspected burglars were using @entity63 's to get rid of stolen items			0
@entity8 promptly changed his story			2
a month later , @entity8 was indefinitely suspended from his police job , with charges against him including misconduct and untruthfulness			1
physical : @entity8 , left , is seen running and fighting in the show , which only had one series on @entity21 he was indicted by a grand jury on july 14 , 2010 on a charge of third - degree theft by receiving stolen property , which could have seen him locked up for five years in prison			1
but just a month before the indictment , @entity8 had applied for retirement and a disability pension , claiming he had injured his leg twice while on the job in july 2009 and january 2010			1
' i feel my injury will prohibit me from doing my job safely and at the level needed , it will put me or other officers in danger , ' @entity8 concluded , according to documents in his state pension file			1
the pension office did not know he was under indictment and he was granted the pension			2
the payout was a staggering two - thirds of his $ 104,555 annual salary , and it was to be paid to him , tax - free , for the rest of his life			0
as he was retired , all charges against @entity8 were dropped in september 2010			1
a year after he received his first payment , it emerged that he had been cast as a minor character in the reality tv show @entity20 , a one - season show about a repossession business			1
' fake ' : despite his appearance on the show , he was receiving nearly $ 70,000 a year for a leg injury questionable : the former @entity12 township cop received the state - paid , tax - free pension even though he had been indicted on receiving stolen goods charges and dismissed from the force clips of the men - one of whom was @entity8 ’s partner in the gold buying business - were recently posted to @entity119 and show him running and wrestling			1
he is seen chasing after a monster truck , pulling a man down from the driver 's seat , throwing him to the ground and climbing inside before driving off			0
when the video emerged , he was sent back to the doctor who originally examined him , and the doctor said @entity8 was no longer disabled			2
it was sent to the police and @entity132 's @entity131 who approved it 10 - 0			0
across the state , at least 5,300 retired police officers and firefighters are receiving disability payments			0
pension payouts total $ 198 million per year and soar by $ 20 million each year			1
' is this one in a million ? ' @entity140 , a member of the @entity142 board of trustees , asked during an interview with @entity144			0
appearance : @entity8 can be seen left in one episode of the show , which followed a repossession business fight : he is seen tackling a man to the ground - even though he said his leg was too injured for him to work ' no , i do n't believe this is one in a million			1
i think there are a lot of people out there who are using the system to fill their needs			0
' @entity8 's resignation remains in effect , according to @entity12 business administrator @entity162			2
' so he resigned with disciplinary charges pending , which happens , ' @entity162 said			0
' we do n't have to take him back … but he does n't have a pension anymore			0
' but in april , @entity166 , a friend of @entity8 's , told @entity15 that the reality tv show had been staged			2
' there 's no way that he could have ever been a police officer with the injury that he sustained , ' @entity166 said - but the board disagreed			0
' we had to stop his pension , ' @entity172 said			0
' otherwise , this would go on in limbo forever			0
and he would be collecting a pension , not being disabled and pretty much laughing at everybody			0
' @entity8 may appeal the decision to the @entity179 , a process that could take years .			0
