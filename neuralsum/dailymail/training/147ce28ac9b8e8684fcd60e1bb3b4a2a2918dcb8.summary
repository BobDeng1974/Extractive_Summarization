@entity0 , from @entity1 , is finally working again after five years out of work a 60 - year - old former electrician is finally working again after five years of unemployment and 547 failed job applications			1
@entity0 , from @entity1 , secured just one interview while he was unemployed , despite applying for hundreds of jobs			1
a string of rejections and the constant isolation began to take its toll on mr @entity0 and he developed severe depression			1
he said he began to ' hate the world ' and wonder if he would ever find work again			2
he said he got so fed up that he even applied to be the managing director of @entity16 ( @entity16 ) on one of his ' silly days '			1
but mr @entity0 has now found work with @entity19 , a firm based in @entity20 , @entity21 , which carries out security contracts around the south west			1
the 60 - year - old , who lives alone , said he is ' over the moon ' to be working again and said the new job has turned his life around			1
when he received his first pay packet , he also went out and treated himself to a steak - for the first time in five years			1
he said : ' my story shows you should never give up - keep plugging away because there 's always something round the corner			2
' now , i love every second of my job and i am so happy to be working			2
i get treated with respect , treated like a human being			2
i 've completely turned my life around and i love doing the job			2
' mr @entity0 had been working as an electrician for 30 years when he was made redundant			1
he had gone through brief spells of unemployment , but never more than around two or three weeks			0
but what mr @entity0 thought would be a temporary gap in his cv turned out to be a five - year wait for a job , during which he relied on his weekly £ 74 state handout			1
he said : ' it was tight			0
no matter what people say , you 've ca n't live on the dole			0
you might be able to survive , but you ca n't live			0
' i used to go out for long walks around @entity1 , because that 's all i could afford			1
i love fishing but i could n't even do that because i could n't afford a bus fare , or take all my equipment on the bus			0
' even going to the cinema was something i had to save up for			0
' although he began applying for electrical work , he soon began applying to do ' anything and everything ' around the @entity1 area			1
he could not apply much further afield because he did not have a car - and could not buy one because he did not have the money			2
mr @entity0 also believes his age and the fact he computer illiterate - something he has now remedied - were to blame for his employment struggle			1
he said : ' i 'd been an electrician for 30 years but because of my age i could no longer work at the same speed and i got made redundant , which resulted in me being unemployed for five years			1
mr @entity0 was referred to @entity83 , pictured , which finally helped him secure a job in security ' i felt so low - i could n't see a future			1
i applied for 547 jobs which resulted in only one interview			2
every advert said you must have a car			0
' you just feel so damn useless			0
it 's the being ignored that really drives you down			0
' the fact that nobody acknowledges the fact that you are even alive			0
but you ca n't give up - we 've all got to work			2
' ' it got the point where i thought this is how it 's going to be - i 'll go stir crazy			2
i think i became introverted and snappy			0
' for five years , apart from signing on , i did n't speak to people			0
i hated the world and myself			0
' mr @entity0 's luck changed when he was referred to @entity83 , a social enterprise which works across @entity109 and @entity110 to get people back into work			1
the group paid for him to get a new suit , shirt and tie and , after putting him on an employability course , secured his second interview in five years			0
@entity0 ( centre ) applied for 547 vacancies during his unemployment spell			1
he is pictured with colleagues @entity122 and @entity124 , both from @entity19 staff from @entity83 even drove mr @entity0 to his interview - which later became a solid job offer			1
he said : ' they were a tremendous help - i did an employability course and they helped me get my @entity133 badge			1
' they helped fund my suit , shirt and tie for interview			0
they also drove me to interview and i was terrified			0
' i could n't believe it when i actually got the job			0
@entity83 then helped me with a hire car until i had a couple of months ' wages and could buy my own car			1
' i could never have done this for myself			0
i think i was getting to the point of giving up and withdrawnig completely from society			0
@entity83 made me see everything in a different way			1
' mr @entity0 now works doing security and client and customer safety			1
the job could be based anywhere across the south west			1
he said : ' at the moment i am guarding an empty @entity159 listed building			0
i patrol the building , secure windows and doors , check security of the building and make sure no - one can get in			2
' every hour we do a patrol			0
' someone actually gave me a chance and so i am doing my best to repay them by putting in 120 per cent effort			0
i am getting a wage			0
' @entity170 , operations director at @entity19 , said ' he 's extremely smart , well mannered and has a good sense of humour			1
' he is calm , respectful and has good judgement , he always turns up on time and is good with customers			0
@entity0 knows how to speak to people with respect			2
' we are very busy so ultimately if we have people , like @entity0 , who really want to work that makes such a difference to us as a business			2
