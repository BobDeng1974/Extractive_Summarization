by @entity0 published : 20:17 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 06:27 est , 7 june 2012 a @entity2 leader has furiously accused the @entity3 of sensationalising a documentary about @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity7 , director of @entity8 of @entity9 , gave an interview for the @entity12 programme entitled ' @entity13 ' investigating racism at the upcoming @entity16 venues			1
footage from the documentary showing anti-semitic chants and racist monkey noises aimed at black football players prompted former @entity23 captain @entity22 to warn fans not to travel to @entity6 and @entity25 otherwise ' you could end up coming back in a coffin			0
' strong words : @entity7 , director of @entity8 of @entity9 , said he was ' exploited ' during the interview the programme also showed south @entity32 fans being attacked at one game and crowds giving @entity35 salutes at another			1
but mr @entity7 says he was ' exploited ' during the hour - long interview with the corporation as it ' completely disregarded anything positive said and aired only comments critical of @entity6 '			1
mr @entity7 , an @entity41 - born jew who has lived in @entity6 for 11 years , says the images used were also selective and other contributors misrepresented			1
he also alleges his suggestion that the broadcasters interviewed two @entity47 footballers , who play for local team @entity48 , about their positive experiences were rejected after being told ' it did n't fit their story '			0
' i am furious at the way the @entity3 has exploited me as a source ' , he said			2
mr @entity7 says the documentary misrepresented the views of two @entity47 footballers who play for local team @entity48 ' the interview lasted approximately one hour during which i emphasized that the small number of football fans in @entity6 engaging in anti-semitic and racist behaviour do not represent @entity6 society as a whole			1
' the organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of @entity5 for its own sensationalist agenda ; in doing so , the @entity3 has insulted all @entity6 people and done a disservice to the growing , thriving @entity2 community of @entity6			2
' @entity72 , one of @entity6 's two black mps , has also criticised the documentary , which first aired on may 28 and is repeated on the @entity75 , in a @entity6 magazine			2
he said : ' i believe that @entity6 is a tolerant country			0
very much on this matter has changed and continues to change for the better			0
' @entity6 have ever more opportunity to come into contact with foreigners - such as dark - skinned people - and that is better for them			0
recall that in the [ @entity6 general } election 30,000 people voted for me			0
do you need any other proof of the tolerance of @entity6			0
' warning : @entity22 has told @entity23 fans to stay away from the @entity90 violence : @entity93 - wielding @entity25 riot police wade into @entity95 fans during a match at the @entity98 stadium in @entity99 it comes as the @entity23 squad yesterday arrived at their tournament training base in @entity9 , south - east @entity6 , ahead of their opening match against @entity104 in @entity25 on monday			0
they are having to take a two - hour flight for the fixture in the city of @entity109			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' @entity12 strongly refutes mr @entity7 's allegation that it misrepresented his interview in the programme , @entity16 : stadiums of @entity115			1
' it was made clear to mr @entity7 that the interview was being carried out in the context of football related racism and anti-semitism in @entity6 and his contribution was clearly placed in this context in the film			1
the programme stated in commentary that he believes that most @entity6 happily accept other faiths but that football hooligans are yet to catch up with wider @entity6 society			2
' both the programme 's producer and reporter deny refusing the offer to interview two @entity47 footballers player in @entity6 because it did not fit the story , in fact they would have jumped at the chance of interviewing them			2
