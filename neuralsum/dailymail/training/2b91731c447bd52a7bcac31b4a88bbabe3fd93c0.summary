by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:47 pm on 27th january 2012 the family of a death row inmate who sent a letter to a local @entity6 newspaper boasting about his ' life of leisure ' behind bars says the convicted murderer is mentally ill and fabricating his living conditions and they offered another letter as proof			1
@entity15 , @entity17 's sister released a letter sent to her from her brother earlier this month that contradicts the recently published two - page boast of leisurely conditions behind bars , disturbing the family of his 17 - year - old murder victim			1
' i try to put on a ( nonchalant ) attitude for you guys but it is overwhelming and depressing to look at these walls and electric doors and bright lights 24 - 7 and digest the fact that i 'm never going to leave here until they murder me or i just die either way i 'm never leaving here alive , ' he wrote in the letter dated january 8 and published by the @entity37			1
differing views : family of death row inmate @entity39 produced a second letter by the convicted murderer that contrasts the felon 's previously flaunted life behind bars ' i 'm bored to death , ' he wrote her			1
' he signed it , ' @entity50 , @entity51			0
' ' i 'm so very sorry for any hurt or anger that was caused by my brother @entity15 's letter to @entity56			2
he is a very depressed man and in his hopelessness , he lashed out , ' his sister @entity57 said in a statement released along with the letter to the @entity37			2
when @entity15 's boastful letter was reported by the @entity56 this week , district attorney @entity62 told @entity64 that the father of murdered @entity66 called him in tears saying , ' he murdered our daughter , got the death penalty and now he 's just sitting in jail laughing at us ! ' hoping to prove otherwise , his sister published the second letter ' ... in order to try to reveal the truth about his mental and emotional state which was brought out at his trial			1
' life behind bars : @entity15 is waiting for his execution in @entity82 of @entity83 , @entity6 but in the meantime described his stay as a luxury , upsetting his victim 's family ' no person in their right mind thinks that living in death row is a life of leisure , ' his son @entity89 told @entity96 in response to the earlier week 's letter			1
' there 's no good explanation for why he wrote that except he 's mentally ill. ' in agreement , his sister also attested to @entity15 having a ' severe mental illness for over 35 years of his 50 years of life			1
he is not happy , he is not comfortable and he is not well			0
' these latest revelations are a sharp contrast from the letter where he describes life as ' ... a gentleman of leisure , watching color tv in the a / c , reading , taking naps at will , eating three well - balanced meals a day			1
' @entity15 ( left ) if accused of the murder of @entity66 ( right ) who was 17 at the time of her death his son agreed himself that letters sent to their family directly , as their only means of communication between them , express his pain and discomfort behind bars			1
' he talks about the four walls closing in , that the lights are always on and he ca n't sleep			0
death row is a horrible place for anybody to be , ' his son said			1
' he 's very severely depressed			0
he has told us that he 's depressed			0
he feels like it 's over for him			0
' taunting his victim 's family this week , @entity15 wrote : ' is the public aware that the chances of my lawful murder taking place in the next 20 years if ever are very slim ? ' @entity15 , 50 , was found guilty of killing the 17 - year - old girl in 2009 , a crime both his sister and son do not believe he committed			1
sentenced : @entity15 was sentenced to death in november for murdering the 17 - year - old girl in 2009 , as he 's seen here blowing his mother a kiss before leaving for death row during a police interrogation he admitted to killing two other women , though he now says that he was lying to distract authorities and cover up other crimes			1
' in every one of those confessions on all of those tapes , he was coming off a three - day crack binge			2
he had n't slept , he was drunk and highly intoxicated			0
he could barely hold his head up , ' @entity89 said			0
' he 's not a killer , ' his sister told the @entity37			0
' he did not kill those girls			0
' ' i am a man who is ready to except [ sic ] his unjust punishment and face @entity164 with a clear conscience unlike you cowards and your cowardly system			0
' kill me if you can , suckers			0
@entity171 ! @entity171 ! @entity171 ! ' he wrote this week to the @entity56			0
@entity15 was sentenced to death on november 18 for the murder of ms @entity66 and has been waiting in @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity6			1
his other alleged victims : @entity175 ( left ) had a 2 - year - old child at the time of her death , and @entity179 ( right ) was killed in 1992 in spite of @entity15 's declarations of grandeur , the conditions of @entity82 have been under a microscope in recent months since the prison warden resigned after the despicable treatment of prisoners with mental illnesses			1
@entity189 stepped down in november - coincidentally the day after @entity15 was sentenced - following the results of an investigation that showed mentally ill inmates being left unattended for weeks at a time and found in cells covered with human feces			2
the conditions in @entity15 's cell seem much more luxurious , however , and he boasted about his free government health care in the letter			1
i 'm housed in a building that connects to the new 55 million dollar hospital with round the clock free medical care 24/7			2
' the gloating letter is not the only one that @entity15 sent from prison which is due to be controversial			1
he also mailed an inflammatory letter to the @entity209 attempting to goad them into fighting for one of his alleged victims , saying that the state ’s justice system was playing racial favorites			2
in addition to ms @entity66 , @entity15 is thought to have killed to other women - @entity218 , 30 , whose burnt remains were found in @entity220 in 2009 and @entity179 , 30 , whose body found in 1992			1
ms @entity175 and ms @entity66 , who were friends and both had a history of drug arrests at the time of their death , were white and ms @entity179 was black			2
@entity15 wrote to the @entity229 civil rights group arguing that mr @entity62 is trying the cases of the two white women first for racially - motivated reasons			1
‘ i implore your great organization to pressure mr. @entity62 until he gives @entity236 her day in court in the interest of justice , ’ @entity15 ’s letter said			2
both of his letters display a flagrant disregard for the victims families and his lack of remorse			0
' i laugh at you self righteous clowns and i spit in the face of your so called justice system			0
the state of @entity6 has sentenced me to death but it 's not real , ' he wrote in the letter to the @entity56			2
@entity82 @entity82 was the first to be built in @entity6 , and was established in december 1884			0
it was built by inmates themselves and took 14 years to construct			0
though it originally cost $ 1.25million to build , construction costs have gone up over the past century , and a major renovation in the 1980s cost $ 28.8million			0
the prison holds 1000 inmates and provides work for the 700 members of staff			2
@entity82 serves as the state 's main execution chamber and houses all inmates on death row			1
on a lighter note , it has bible study classes , team sports and job assignments within in the prison for 260 prisoners			0
inmates can even take college correspondence courses through the prestigious @entity275 at @entity276 , which was most recently ranked number 29 in the country .			0

earlier @entity15 sent an open letter boasting of prison life with color television , air conditioning , naps whenever he *pleases* , and free health care
