he is back behind bars in @entity6 for deliberately moving to @entity7 to prey on more children a ' sadistic ' paedophile who was deported from @entity3 after he was jailed for rape was back behind bars in @entity6 today for deliberately moving to a seaside town to prey on more children			1
@entity2 , 77 , who left the @entity6 in the 50s , had been ordered back to @entity15 by a judge in @entity17 after he was jailed for 12 years in 1994 for abusing youngsters at his flat			1
but after landing in @entity20 last year , he decided to settle in @entity7 , @entity21 , because he knew there would be lots of children there - either on holiday with their family or living in the town			1
despite being monitored by police @entity2 soon ' disappeared ' from a house where he was staying which turned out to be the address of a charity			2
when @entity2 was eventually traced three weeks later it emerged he had gone to a church group offering teenage girls the chance to work for him canvassing his skills as a sewing machine repairer on a door to door basis			1
he also offered the @entity42 youngsters a place in a home he said he was buying			0
@entity45 obtained a @entity46 banning him from employing any children and also having no contact with youngsters unless in the presence of an approved adult			0
upon being served with the order , @entity2 told magistrates he would prefer go to prison			1
he shouted at the bench : ' i would rather go to jail now ...			0
i have to go to prison			0
' he then booked himself into a hotel asked if there were any children living there			0
he also returned four times to the home of a mother - of - four , in the hope he would find one of her children home alone			0
at @entity70 denied breaching the sex offender order claiming it ' breached his human rights ' as he had to tell police where he was living			1
but he was convicted and jailed for three years			2
passing sentence judge @entity76 told him : ' @entity77 , in my view , are an exceptionally dangerous man with nothing to lose			0
the seaside resort of @entity7 where @entity70 heard the ' sadistic ' 77 - year - old had moved to because there was a high concentration of vulnerable children ' you deliberately and flagrantly breached this order by a pre-meditated and wilful act of defiance			1
' when you landed at @entity91 you presented a very obvious and major problem to authorities			0
' you said you were going to live in @entity7 - the reason , i 'm sure , as you know is that @entity7 would have a large number of children present - holiday makers and families - and a high concentration of vulnerable children and young people			2
- judge @entity76 ' the police were gravely concerned yet you soon decided that you 'd had enough of being controlled and the police knowing where you were			0
' you gave them a new and false address and the consequences was that the police had no idea where you were			0
' i am sure that you deliberately gave the police a false address - the reason is that you wanted to commit further sexual offences to children and young children			0
' some of your @entity3 convictions arose when you ran a similar business to use it as an opportunity to meet boys and to have boys living with you			2
' police take the view that what you were doing on the streets of @entity7 appear to mirror your offences in @entity3			1
' @entity2 who left the @entity6 in the 1950s used his dual citizenship to live in a flat in the @entity17 suburb of @entity132 and took over a sewing machine repair business from another @entity134 in 1974			1
but he was arrested in 1993 after boys aged between ten and 15 claimed he had sexually assaulted them between 1980 and 1993			1

@entity2 has been jailed for three years			2
in his defence he had denied breaching a sex offender order claiming it ' breached his human rights ' as he had to tell police where he was living police who raided his property found child pornographic literature , photographs and films at the flat			1
@entity3 prosecutors said @entity2 's business was ' no more than a front ' used by him to lure the boys to his flat for his sexual gratification			1
@entity2 was initially found guilty of 16 sex charges including indecent assault and buggery and was jailed for 12 years in 1994			1
but two years later he faced another trial in @entity17 after another victim came forward to say he was abused in 1980 when he was just 11			0
during the second trial @entity2 denied all the offences and represented himself cross examining the victim in the witness box			2
it sparked calls for a change on the law in @entity3 about defendants being able to cross examine witnesses themselves			2
@entity2 was ordered to serve at least nine years in an @entity3 jail before paroled in 2008			1
@entity2 spent 18 years in custody in total and when jailed for the final time , a judge in @entity179 called him a ' sadistic , callous and most heartless human being '			1

he registered himself as staying at the address of a @entity7 charity but last june when police tried to trace him the charity had never heard of him and a nationwide manhunt began for him			2
he was arrested three weeks later in @entity7 town centre			2
the court heard @entity2 had been going to a centre at @entity190 where he pretended to have been sent from the @entity191 to offer employment to girls aged 14 and over to work as canvassers for him			1
he said girls aged over 16 could live at a house he was buying in @entity7 and he also set up a door - to - door sewing machine repair business			1
he repeatedly went to one house where two young girls lived four times - despite being told their household did not have a sewing machine			0
@entity2 , who defended himself told the hearing : ' every address i went to the police effectively had me illegally evicted			0
' they would be visiting every day and the landlords asked me to leave because they did n't want the police coming			0
' ' it meant that i would have to live on the streets			0
' i was forced to spend the night sheltering under the window of a disused house in the rain			0
' it was a matter of life and death as far as i was concerned			0
i did n't think i was breaking any law - i had a reasonable excuse			0
the order that was put against me was an impossibility			0
' the lifetime sexual offences prevention order will remain in place and it means @entity2 can not live anywhere in @entity15 and @entity226 without the premises being vetted by specialist sex crime officers first			2
@entity2 is the latest in a line of @entity6 - born criminals who have been deported here after being jailed in @entity3 for serious offences			1
