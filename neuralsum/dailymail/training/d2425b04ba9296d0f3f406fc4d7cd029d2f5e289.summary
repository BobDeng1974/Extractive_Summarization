by @entity0 for @entity1 weight - loss surgery can also reap positive effects on brain activity , new research suggests			1
the team of scientists behind the study also said there is evidence the operations could reduce the risk of alzheimer 's disease			1
they found the procedures can curb changes in the brain associated with weight gain and improve cognitive function involved in planning , strategising and organising			1
a new study by scientists in @entity23 has found evidence that weight - loss surgery can help improve brain function			1
they found gastric bypass procedures can curb changes in the brain that are associated with obesity bariatric surgery is generally used as a last resort to help people who are dangerously overweight			1
it involves either reducing the size of the stomach or shortening the distance food travels through the digestive tract - limiting the time it has to be absorbed			0
the procedures , available on the @entity42 , are known to be highly effective in cases of serious obesity			0
but they also appear to have a positive influence on brain activity , according to the new findings			1
a study of the impact of bariatric surgery on 17 obese women found it produced distinct improvements in mental functions linked to planning , strategy and organisation			1
professor @entity57 , from the @entity58 in @entity23 , said : ' when we studied obese women prior to bariatric surgery , we found some areas of their brains metabolised sugars at a higher rate than normal weight women			2
' in particular , obesity led to altered activity in a part of the brain linked to the development of alzheimer 's disease - the posterior cingulate gyrus			2
since bariatric surgery reversed this activity , we suspect the procedure may contribute to a reduced risk of alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia			2
' past research has shown that obese individuals are 35 per cent more at risk of developing @entity83 's than people of normal weight			1
the new research focused on a procedure known as a @entity89 gastric bypass ( @entity90 ) which combines the two types of bariatric surgery			1
brain scans and a range of psychological tests were used to assess its effect over a period of six months			0
results from the obese women were compared with those from a ' control ' group of 16 lean women who did not undergo bariatric surgery			0
the researchers also noted evidence the surgery reduced the risk of developing @entity83 's disease the scans showed that the excessive brain activity regarding sugar seen in the obese women disappeared after the procedure			1
six months post-surgery , brain metabolism levels were similar in both groups of women			0
in addition , bariatric surgery seemed to improve the performance of the obese women in a test of ' executive function '			0
this is the brain 's ability to connect past experience and current action , and is involved in planning , organising and making strategic decisions			2
other tests measuring various aspects of memory and thinking ability showed no change after bariatric surgery			0
the results appear in the @entity136 , published by the @entity137			0
professor @entity57 said : ' our findings suggest the brain is another organ that benefits from weight loss induced by surgery			0
' the increased brain activity the obese women exhibited before undergoing surgery did not result in improved cognitive performance , which suggests obesity may force the brain to work harder to achieve the same level of cognition			1
' dr @entity151 , head of research at @entity153 , the @entity155 ’s leading dementia research charity , said : ' although obesity has been linked to an increased risk of dementia , this very small study does n’t tell us whether weight loss surgery could prevent the condition			2
' this research involved people in their 40s and did not look at dementia , and we do n’t know whether the changes in brain activity seen in this study would affect a person ’s risk of developing the condition			1
' the people included in this research were severely obese , so it ’s hard to know how these results might relate to people whose obesity does not warrant this type of surgery			0
' continued investment in research is important if we are to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the links between obesity and increased dementia risk			0
' a better understanding of how factors such as obesity may affect our risk of dementia could give us important clues for preventing the condition			2
' in the meantime , research shows we can lower our risk of dementia by eating a healthy , balanced diet , exercising regularly , not smoking , and keeping blood pressure and weight in check			0

scientists in @entity23 found gastric bypass surgery can affect brain activity
found the operation curbed changes in the brain associated with obesity
they noted improvements in planning , strategising and organising
researchers also found evidence operation could reduce risk of @entity83 's
