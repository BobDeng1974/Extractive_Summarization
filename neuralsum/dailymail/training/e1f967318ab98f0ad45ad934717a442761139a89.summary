the photographer has visited @entity5 many times and has watched it grow in size and wealth			1
the 33 - year - old says there is an unspoken understanding that there are three different classes of people in @entity5 - the @entity23 , the expats and , at the bottom , the labourers who built the city			1
@entity14 explains that several workers have their passports seized at the airport and are forced to work extremely long hours in blistering heat for very little pay			1

right , workers are forced to clean themselves using spartan sanitation labourers seek to make extra cash at the weekends by setting up food stalls and trading with fellow migrants improvised fun : labourers enjoying a game called @entity114 , similar to billiards , which they built themselves gruelling : the labourers usually work 14 hours where in summer the temperature goes over @entity121			1
@entity123 tourists are told not to stay outside more than five minutes every evening , the hundreds of thousands of young men who build the city are driven to vast concrete wastelands to work these labourers are working on luxurious boats in a shipyard in @entity131			1
these boats are used mostly for tourism and can fetch $ 3,755,000 @entity14 explains : ' people come to this land to make their future and benefit from the huge investments in construction and oil			1
' there are many luxurious hotels and world - renowned structures which labourers have built over recent years			2
' the employer usually takes their passport as soon as they arrive at @entity146 and they are all sent to @entity15			0
' the labourers usually work 14 hours where in summer the temperature goes over @entity121			1
' conversely , it is usually advised for western tourists not to stay outside for more than five minutes in summer			0
' according to the government 's laws , work places should close down during this kind of temperature in order not to harm labourers and their health , but the government often does not even announce the right weather temperature			1
' harrowing : their accommodation is cramped , filthy , sweltering and often overrun with vermin			0
yet many ca n't leave the secret vegetable market within @entity15 is a cheap place for labourers to provide themselves with vegetable and fruits when @entity14 arrived he saw dozens of men sitting around the courtyard on broken furniture , cooking in dirty kitchens and stray animals skulking around			1
he added : ' the rooms are 12ft by 12ft with six beds and accommodate six to eight people			0
food is usually cooked using gas cylinders in terrible condition			0
' one of the @entity31 workers stopped me , took me to his room and showed me a sign he had written on some wood			0
it read : ' dear boss i am working in your company already 1 year , my contract was expired but i can not get my salary all 4 month less			0
i must go @entity31 soon , please pay for my money			0
' pleading : a @entity31 worker has written a message for his employer begging them to pay him and let him go home makeshift : using a broken mirror and stationed next to a bin , a barber sets up shop @entity205 labourers during their evening prayer			2
@entity14 believes that the stories of labourers are extremely important @entity209 , who enjoys a better standard of living than other workers , gets ready before heading out to work at a decoration company the expats who enjoy high incomes will likely never experience the dark side of @entity5 , where the labourers ' suffering is hidden from the media			1
@entity14 says he was so moved after seeing it for himself that he decided to create the photo series			1
he said : ' i did not try to get permission since these areas are restricted to the public and i was sure i would be unsuccessful since the @entity23 does not wish to show this aspect of their country			0
' so , i took pictures at night when it was much easier to hide from security			0
as soon as i started meeting labourers and getting to know them , i realised they were scared of me			2
' after a while one of the labourers who could speak @entity235 told @entity14 they were afraid he was from the government			1
devotion : labourers heading back to their rooms after evening prayer			2
the mosque inside @entity15 is one of the few well - maintained buildings @entity243 , 24 , has been working as cleaner for the past two years and lives with five roommates in @entity15 he added : ' most of the time i slept in my car and waited until it got dark so i could do my work			1
' in spite of his efforts , the photographer was arrested by security and questioned			2
' i pretended to be a lost tourist and the security wanted to report me to the police since the labourers ' area is forbidden to photograph			2
' they let him go			0
the @entity1 photographer hopes that this series will make people think twice about what goes on around them , and if they are moved by the suffering they might be encouraged to do something to help			2
' i think treating humans so cruelly is against their human rights and yet it still exists around us , ' he said			0
' i ca n't tell anyone what to think of the images , but i believe they speak for themselves			0
