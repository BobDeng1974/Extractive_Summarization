' just be yourself ' is what so many children and adults alike are told every day			2
but for some this is much more of a challenge than for others			0
' if you do n't be yourself , you 're going to be miserable for your whole life , ' is the advice that comes from 11 - year - old @entity9			1
@entity9 was born as a boy called @entity11 , but told her parents last year just weeks after she turned ten she felt as though she was stuck in the wrong body			1
in a documentary set to air on @entity17 's @entity16 on monday evening , she and her family have chosen to share their story to encourage others to speak out			1
because of this @entity9 's parents @entity27 , a social worker , and @entity30 , who runs their bed and breakfast , knew they had to act fast for the sake of their eldest daughter			1
' there was probably a couple of months where she ’d start a conversation with me saying i ’m just feeling weird , i do n’t feel right			0
she said ... i do n’t like my body , and i said well ... what do you you mean ? ' and she said			0
. i feel like i ’m a girl , i ’m in the wrong body , ' @entity9 's mother @entity27 told @entity16			1
' i just said to my mum that i did n't wan na be boy , i felt like a girl and that i ’m sick of living in this body , ' said @entity9			1
@entity9 ( right ) , with dad @entity30 , mum @entity27 and younger sister @entity50 , 8 , recently came out at school but says people treat her differently @entity9 is working with dr @entity53 , @entity54 at @entity55 , who says the support of a child 's family is critical to their wellbeing during such a difficult time ' it took three or four weeks to go through it but just see how upset she was , she would come home miserable ( and say ) " i do n't want to live " , ' her father @entity30 revealed , speaking of the many appointments and processes @entity9 had to go through			1
' she ... just whispered , i just ca n’t see what the future looks like for me			0
and that was awful ... i think for me that was the point where the confusion kind of melted away a little bit and you just sort of think well god , we ’ve only got one job here and this is to help her create a future that she can live with , that she can thrive in , ' mum @entity27 revealed			0
the other staggering statistics show that 30 percent of young children who don ; t get adequate treatment attempt suicide while 50 percent self - harm			2
more and more transgender children are presenting at clinics around @entity87 but experts put this down to children coming out earlier rather than hiding			0
currently there are two stages of medical treatments for children who are transgender , the first of which is puberty blockers			0
these are used so children are able to figure out what they would like to do in the future , giving them time to make a long term decision without any consequences			0
the 11 - year - old says people treat her differently when they find out she 's transgender but she just wants to feel like herself her dad @entity30 revealed how one day @entity9 came home and said ' i do n't want to live ' like this once they stop taking the blockers their body continues to develop as it would have , but if they choose to go ahead they are given cross changing hormones			1
however in what is already a trying time for these young people , they also need to be assessed by at least five doctors before they can begin any treatment			0
plus until recently families in @entity87 would have to go through court to get permission and access to these treatments			0
although puberty blockers can now be obtained without court consent , teenagers still have to get permission to commence the second part of treatment			1
however families are upset that these young people must still go to court to consent to the treatment			2
chief justice @entity135 shares this view , and is keen to see a test case go to the full bench of the @entity139 and then the @entity140 so that court need not be involved in the decision			1
currently teenagers have to go through court to access the second part of treatment , but families are fighting against this ' well look i 'd like to see the @entity140 have the opportunity to examine these kinds of cases , these gender identity cases and to decide whether or not the court has to be involved at all , ' she told @entity16			1
since coming out to her parents @entity9 has also come out at school , but said she has faced a lot of criticism and harsh words from her schoolmates			2
' sometimes people treat me differently when they find out i 'm transgender ... people being cruel to me it kind of tells you what not to do , ' she revealed in a preview of the program			0
@entity9 's doctor , dr @entity53 , paediatrician and clinical lead of @entity168 at @entity55 , said that the parent 's role supporting their children during such a difficult time is essential to their wellbeing			2
' i often hear stories of young people who are not supported by their family , or even outwardly rejected , ' dr @entity53 said			0
watch the full program monday evening on @entity16 , 8.30pm @entity17 .			2

at 11 years old @entity9 , born as a boy called @entity11 , *identifies* as transgender
she told her parents a year *ago* that she felt like she was stuck in the wrong body
her family have chosen to tell @entity17 's @entity16 their story in the hope of helping others
currently children have to go through the courts to get part of their treatment for **reassign*ment*
chief justice @entity135 wants to see a test case go through the @entity200 courts
this would mean teenagers and their families would be *spared* from having to prove their consent to *reassign* in court
