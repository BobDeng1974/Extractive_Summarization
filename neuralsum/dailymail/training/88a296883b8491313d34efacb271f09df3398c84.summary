by @entity0 , deputy political editor for @entity1 @entity3 mp @entity2 has clashed with commons speaker @entity4 commons speaker @entity4 was facing further questions over his authority today after his own staff allegedly railed against him in an expletive - ridden phone call to a @entity3 mp			1
mr @entity4 is under pressure over his attempt to parachute in controversial @entity12 @entity11 to become @entity14 ’s most senior official			1
but after a revolt by @entity17 the speaker announced a ‘ modest pause ’ in the appointment process			1
following mr @entity4 ’s u-turn he has faced a series of challenges in the @entity23			1
leading rebel @entity2 revealed today that he had been egged on by mr @entity4 ’s own parliamentary staff			1
he told the @entity28 magazine : ‘ i have had so many messages of support from junior employees of the @entity32 saying go for it , the speaker is a c * * *			2
’ the @entity3 mp added : ‘ i do n’t use language like that , but i do think he can be a bit of a knob			2
he does n’t inspire loyalty at any level it seems			0
’ the remarks came after mr @entity4 rowed with @entity3 mps in the @entity23 for a fourth day about the selection of ms @entity45			1
in tense exchanges , mr @entity2 said he had been told that head - hunters @entity47 were stopped from meeting the panel and presenting information about ms @entity11 , who was nominated by the speaker as the replacement for recently retired sir @entity53			2
the nomination , which must be confirmed by the @entity55 , has provoked a row about her qualifications to undertake the constitutionally sensitive role of head clerk advising the speaker on matters of procedure in the @entity32			2
on a point of order to the speaker , mr @entity2 said : ‘ under those circumstances , i wonder whether you might wish to put the record straight so the @entity32 might not be misled ? ’ mr @entity4 gave a lengthy reply , insisting : ‘ let me reiterate : i believe you to be incorrect			1
the panel , of which i was chair , was briefed about all of the applicants for the post of clerk and chief executive and i think you are quite wrong to say there was prevention of @entity78 giving information to the panel			0
‘ the panel made a judgment on the material with which it was provided , including a piece of information provided to it on the occasion of the second set of interviews			0
the panel made its own judgement on the basis of that information and did not see any need for a meeting			0
‘ i would also reiterate ... the individual , whose name you bandy around in the @entity32 , that of @entity11 , was indeed on the original list of proposed interviewees			2
you put it to me that she had not been ; i told you she had been - and i have one slight advantage of you in this matter			0
‘ that is , i was there and i do know , and you were n't and do not			0
’ mr @entity4 stopped mr @entity2 from intervening again with a further point of order - despite the mp , who has had long feud with the speaker , shouting from a seated position			1
mr @entity4 added : ‘ i hope you will be able to observe the normal courtesies that obtain in the @entity32			1
that is the end of the matter for today			0
’ @entity3 @entity113 however raised a further point of order , and questioned why deputy speaker @entity116 had been left off the selection panel			0
he was replaced by @entity119 mp @entity118 , whom mr @entity113 suggested could have a potential conflict of interest because of her role as chairwoman of the @entity124			2
commons speaker @entity4 is facing growing questions over his authority in the @entity23 but mr @entity4 said : ‘ in the selection of panels that make judgments of this kind , it is perfectly normal practice to vary the membership of those panels from one instance to another - there is nothing disorderly , irregular or particularly surprising about that			1
‘ secondly ... i thought when you raised the point ( about mrs @entity118 ) before it was a poor point and it has n't improved with time			0
there is no conflict of interest at all			0
’ he added : ‘ i think the @entity32 will agree i have set out the matters with crystal clarity			0
i have done so a number of times and i would hope people having had the point made to them a number of times would see it and acknowledge its veracity			0
’ the speaker then clashed again with mr @entity2 during a further point of order from @entity3 mp @entity158 , who spoke up in favour of mr @entity4			1
mr @entity2 was accused of heckling and was told by mr @entity4 : ‘ try showing some basic courtesy and manners of the kind the people who attend our proceedings would wish to hear			1
‘ you made your point and it was decisively dealt with by the chair			0
’ mr @entity4 has called for the historic role of @entity23 clerk to be split , arguing that the traditional qualifications of the clerk do not match up to the needs of managing the large staff and budget of @entity14			1
the £ 200,000 - a - year role has always previously been held by one person , appointed by @entity179 from the @entity55 to ensure independence and impartiality .			0

comes after rebel mps challenged the speaker for the fourth day in a row
