you might think seemingly endless sales would be guaranteed to tempt shoppers through the door			1
but high street retailers are boosting their fortunes – by scrapping them			0
@entity7 and @entity8 have called a halt to long - running promotions which fail to excite shoppers , replacing them with shorter events that have more impact			1
and both have announced revived figures since making the change			1
experts claim prolonged sales can devalue products and encourage shoppers to delay buying an item until it is reduced			1
high street chains , including @entity8 , are calling time on cut - price promotions that seem to go on forever figures show a third of all fashion purchases are now made in a sale or promotion , and there have been warnings that shoppers are being ‘ trained ’ not to buy at full price , undermining profits			1
in the past , retail analysts mocked @entity7 for being ‘ never knowingly not on sale ’ – a pun on the @entity38 slogan ‘ @entity39 ’			1
now , the department store has reduced its endless blue cross sales and promotions , which it admitted sometimes ‘ create noise but do n’t create value ’			1
@entity7 said that despite fewer sale events , feedback suggests customers now think the store is actually better value			2
the move follows similar cuts to the number of supermarket promotions			2
@entity54 ’s recently dropped some of its popular offers – including three for £ 10 on some meat and fish products – in favour of lower prices on more everyday items			0
in the past year , @entity7 has held 39 fewer sale days , meaning it spent a month less in a promotional period			2
it has also put more emphasis on ensuring pre-sale garments are ‘ better value ’ and that the ‘ first price is the right price ’ , cutting the cost of some menswear , womenswear and home goods			0
@entity7 said despite fewer sale events , feedback suggests customers now think the store is better value chief executive @entity76 said : ‘ it ’s not about ending promotions , but being more focused and removing events that create noise but do n’t create value			1
’ @entity8 also expressed a desire last year to return to being a ‘ full price retailer ’			2
chief executive @entity83 said this week : ‘ in the @entity87 , our strategy of reducing promotional and discount activity and returning to be a full price retailer has continued to stabilise margin			0
’ its latest @entity90 period sales lasted three weeks instead of an incredible eight weeks in 2013 - 14			2
@entity91 , of retail analysts @entity92 , said : ‘ there is a strong argument that the more sales you hold , the more you have to hold			0
consumers get used to the store always being in sale and hold out from shopping there until the next one			0
’ @entity103 , of retail analysts @entity102 , added : ‘ the model of continual discounting is damaging for a retailer , not least because it erodes margins and dissuades shoppers from purchasing at full price			0
‘ it ’s like a drug – the more a retailer does it , the more they have to keep doing it to generate a sales hit			0
‘ in some ways , unless it is part of a specific business model , constant discounting is a sign of failure			0
