by @entity1 reporter a farmer 's daughter who says she was left at home ‘ with a muck fork ’ while her sisters went out dancing has triumphed in her fight for a fair share of her family ’s £ 7million estate			1
@entity11 , 45 , who was nicknamed the ‘ @entity12 ’ , claims she was assured by her parents that she would ultimately take over the thriving farm and its pedigree milking herd			1
but following a row they began proceedings to evict her , while she began a legal campaign to secure what she said was her rightful share of the farm in @entity24			1
@entity11 won her legal campaign to secure what she said was her rightful share of the farm in @entity24			1
her parents have now seen their challenge against that decision dismissed at the @entity29 miss @entity11 won her case and yesterday a challenge by her parents , @entity33 , 75 , and @entity34 , 76 , was dismissed by the @entity29			1
@entity35 , sitting with @entity36 and @entity37 , said he hoped the family would now resolve their differences in relation to her entitlement ‘ without recourse to further costly and divisive litigation ’			2
miss @entity11 told the original hearing that she missed out on going to @entity47 dances with her two sisters , @entity49 and @entity50 , as a teenager because she had to stay at home to deal with her chores at @entity54			1
appeal : @entity56 and @entity57 have lost a challenge in the @entity29 after their daughter @entity11 won a legal campaign to secure what she claimed was her rightful share of the family farm her parents apparently told her that her patience would be rewarded			1
‘ they always told me that the farm would be left to me , ’ she told the hearing			2
‘ even on my birthday , when the other girls were having things , they would say , “ you will have the damn lot one day , it will all be yours ”			0
she claimed that her sisters once paraded through the poultry shed in their ball gowns while she prepared turkeys for @entity79			0
her father would regularly warn her ‘ not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg ’ if she complained about her treatment , she added			0
miss @entity11 claimed that until she reached the age of 21 , she was paid nothing at all for her work on the farm and , after that , there was a period when she was paid just £ 15 - a - day for milking the cows , although sometimes she received more			1
she was said to have a ‘ passionate interest ’ in the herd and , by 1989 , was the only daughter at the farm after her sisters began other careers			0
and , when she left to work elsewhere , her father was said to have begged her to return			0
although there was evidence that her parents had ‘ pinned their hopes ’ on @entity102 over the years , they became increasingly annoyed by her relationships with men			0
lord justice @entity35 said this concern was not so much the men involved but ‘ any children that they had and how that may impact upon their duties to keep the business in the family ’			0
‘ her mother referred to a string of men , to whom she referred as “ wretches ” , with kids behind them , ’ said the judge			0
despite their deteriorating relationship , miss @entity11 claims she was shown a draft will in 2009 that left the lion ’s share of the farm to her			1
however , her parents subsequently proposed to place the farm in trust for the benefit of all three sisters equally			2
family relations hit rock bottom in august 2012 during an altercation during which milk was thrown over @entity102 by her mother , and she and her father ended up entangled on the floor , where she bit her father ’s leg			2
@entity54 , near @entity137 in @entity24			1
@entity11 claimed she was promised the farm			2
she won a bid to secure a share of the £ 7million estate while her parents have lost an appeal against the decision it led to the legal battle in which @entity146 and mrs @entity11 sought to evict their daughter from the farm cottage , where she still lives close to her parents ’ farmhouse , while she fought for her share of the farm			1
at the original hearing , judge @entity154 ruled that miss @entity11 had relied on her parents ’ promises and thrown herself into working on the farm			1
she was thus entitled to a ‘ beneficial interest ’ in the business			0
dismissing her parents ’ appeal against the ruling , @entity35 described the dispute as ‘ in many ways a tragic case ’			0
‘ the bitterness between the parties was such that each had few , if any , good words to say about the other , ’ he said			0
‘ the fact remained , however , that between them they had over the years built up a prodigious @entity174 pedigree milking herd and a highly successful business			0
‘ it is greatly to be hoped that they might now be able to resolve such remaining differences as they have in relation to @entity11 ’s entitlement without recourse to further costly and divisive litigation			2
