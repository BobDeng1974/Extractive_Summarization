by @entity0 a young doctor who is dying of cancer has described how patients are ‘ dehumanised ’ by @entity5 hospitals			1
@entity6 said she had been left psychologically scarred after being told her cancer had spread by a junior doctor who did not even look her in the eye			1
the 32 - year - old also said that consultants and other staff referred to patients within earshot by their types of illness or bed numbers			2
before : dr @entity19 , pictured above on her wedding day with her husband @entity22 in july 2005			1
she was later diagnosed with sarcoma , a bone and muscle cancer dr @entity19 was diagnosed with sarcoma , a rare form of cancer affecting the bones and muscles , three years ago when she was just 29			1
at first , it was hoped the tumour was confined to her abdomen and could be removed by surgery			0
but she was later told it had spread and is terminal			1
describing the way the bad news was broken to her , she said : ‘ if you can put yourself in my position – i ’m 29 years old , i know i ’ve got cancer , i think it ’s confined to my abdomen so i ’m expecting to have an operation , maybe some chemotherapy and possibly a cure			2
' dehumanised ' : dr @entity52 , pictured again with her husband , said doctors would routinely refer to her as ' bed 7 ' ‘ i ’m in a side room			2
i can hear everything that ’s going on outside			0
i ’m in pain and alone			0
‘ a junior doctor comes to see me to talk to me about the results of the mri scan i ’d had earlier in the week			1
i ’d never met this doctor before			2
he came into my room , he sat down in the chair next to me and looked away from me			0
‘ without any warning or asking if i wanted anyone with me he just said , “ your cancer has spread ”			2
‘ he then could not leave the room quick enough and i was left in deep psychological distress			0
i never saw him again			0
i am a little bit psychologically scarred by that experience			2
’ despite her illness , dr @entity19 has continued to work as a registrar – a middle - grade doctor – specialising in elderly medicine at @entity78 ’s hospital , @entity79			1
she also gives speeches to medical professionals about improving care			0
addressing managers at the @entity84 in @entity85 yesterday , she said : ‘ coming to hospital is a really dehumanising experience			1
‘ you really do leave your personality and humanity at the doorstep and sometimes even your dignity			0
’ dr @entity19 also warned that , too often , doctors ‘ forget the patient ’			1
‘ i ’ve been referred to within earshot by several consultants as that girl with @entity98 ( desmoplastic small - round - cell tumour )			0
‘ within one sentence i ’d been reduced to just somebody with a rare cancer and nothing else			2
‘ i ’m much more than just a rare cancer , i ’m a wife , a daughter , an auntie – auntie to a new baby within a few months			0
’ she also said staff had kept referring to her as ‘ bed 7 ’			0
keeping on : dr @entity19 kept up her work as a registrar at @entity110 in @entity79 ( pictured ) after her diagnosis dr @entity19 wrote of her battle with cancer in the @entity114 in 2012			1
‘ some senior consultants see a patient ’s death as a failure on their part - but death is part of life , ’ she said			0
‘ and there has to be dignity in death			0
i have led crash teams , done chest compression , seen hundreds of people being resuscitated			0
it is not like @entity129 on television - it ’s brutal , undignified , a horrible process with only a small percentage surviving			0
why would a seriously - ill person want their body pummelled like that ? ’ speaking at the same conference yesterday @entity137 , the @entity5 executive overseeing controversial plans to harvest data from patients ’ medical records , defended the proposals as a means of identifying poor care			1
the report of dr @entity6 ’s speech at the @entity84 ( @entity114 ) omitted reference to her positive message , which is all about improving the @entity5			1
her ‘ hello , my name is … ’ speech , made at the most important healthcare conference of the year , was one of the most powerful i ’ve ever witnessed			0
her insights into what we must treasure and what needs to change in the @entity5 are as important as the views of @entity159 and @entity160			2
we want to ensure that voices like @entity6 ’s are heard : we had staff and patient voices throughout this year ’s conference			1
we ’re building on the dedication of both staff and the public towards the @entity5 , while working on areas we know we need to improve			1
@entity6 is a remarkable woman who has made a huge impression on the health service , both as a practising doctor and as a campaigner for improving care			1
in years to come , ‘ hello , my name is … ’ will be fundamental to the @entity5 , thanks to dr @entity6			1
@entity175 , chief executive , @entity84			0
