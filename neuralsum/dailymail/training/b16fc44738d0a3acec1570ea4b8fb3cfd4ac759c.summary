by @entity0 published : 21:36 est , 14 april 2012 updated : 06:45 est , 15 april 2012 @entity2 's new leader gave his first public speech sunday since taking power , portraying himself as a strong military chief unafraid of foreign powers as the army showed off what appeared to be a new long - range missile			1
@entity11 's lengthy speech - two days after @entity2 launched a long - range rocket in defiance of international warnings - took @entity2 gathered at @entity15 and before televisions across the country by surprise			1
his father , late leader @entity19 , addressed the public only once during his lifetime			2
calm and measured , @entity11 covered a wide range of topics , from foreign policy to the economy , as he spoke during choreographed festivities honoring the 100th birthday of his late grandfather , @entity2 founder @entity28			1
the rocket unveiled on sunday , which appeared to have several stages , was similar to the one that broke into pieces over the @entity35 shortly after liftoff friday , but was of a more overtly military design			2
address : @entity2 leader @entity11 speaks during a mass parade to celebrate founder @entity28 's 100th birthday in @entity42 on sunday uniform : @entity2 female soldiers attend a mass military parade in @entity42 's @entity15 to celebrate 100 years since the birth of the @entity2 founder @entity28 while it 's not clear how powerful or significant this addition to the @entity2 arsenal is - or whether it was a mock - up - it signaled that @entity2 will continue to build up its military despite the failed launch			1
although that launch was a huge , costly embarrassment , @entity28 's address sunday was seen by analysts as an expression of confidence by the young leader meant to show that he is firmly in control			1
@entity11 's words often mirrored what @entity2 regularly says in its state media , but there was symbolism in the images of the new leader , who is believed to be in his late 20s , addressing the country on state tv and then watching - and often laughing and gesturing in relaxed conversation with senior officials - as a parade of @entity50 troops and hardware marched by			1
outside analysts have raised worries about how the new leader , who has been seen but not publicly heard since taking over after @entity19 's december death , would govern a country that is building a nuclear weapons program and has previously threatened @entity81 and @entity82 with war			0
preparing to speak : @entity11 claps and smiles before giving his first public address as tens of thousands gathered in @entity42 's main square for meticulously choreographed festivities in honour : @entity11 , centre , waves to crowds today during the celebrations to mark the centenary of the birth of his grandfather , the founder of the world 's only @entity97 monarchy , ' eternal president ' @entity28 the speech was a good ' first impression for his people and for the world , ' said @entity104 , a @entity2 expert at @entity106 's @entity105			1
' he demonstrated that he can speak in public fairly well , and at this stage that in itself - more than what he actually said - is important			0
i think we might be seeing him speak in public more often , and show a different style than his father			0
' @entity28 emphasized in his speech the importance of strengthening @entity2 's defenses by placing the country 's ' first , second and third ' priorities on military might			1
however , he also made clear he is open to working with foreign countries that do not have hostile policies toward his nation , and said he would strive to reunify @entity2			0
' it 's a heartbreaking fact that our nation has been divided for more than 70 years , ' he said			0
' i will make painstaking efforts toward reunification			0
' legs : female soldiers march past the podium during the military parade in @entity2 today the female @entity2 soldiers keep stern faces as they line up in front of their leader great strides forward : female sailors and soldiers hold machine guns during the military procession today @entity28 also stressed the importance of national unity , calling his country ' @entity28 's @entity2 ' rather than @entity2			1
in recent days , the square bearing his grandfather 's name has been redecorated , with the @entity152 and @entity153 portraits that adorned key buildings taken down and replaced with long red banners vowing to defend the new leader ' to the death			1
' at the front are portraits of the two late leaders , @entity28 and @entity19			2
' that suggests to me that they want to let the country , and the world , know that this is a '' new '' country , ' @entity167 , a @entity169 professor who works frequently with top @entity171 and @entity2 officials , after watching the events in @entity42			1
' in his speech today , he said '' we have a second century of @entity175 ''			0
' the young leader also underlined his commitment to aggressively building the economy and improving the people 's daily lives , an approach backed up by a decision to promote two economists to key @entity185 posts earlier in the week			0
@entity2 has suffered decades of economic hardship following a famine in the mid- 1990s and the loss of aid from the @entity190			2
@entity11 's formal three - year succession has coincided with a push to improve the economy by employing modern technology			2
display : a @entity2 man stands on a rooftop near a @entity2 flag as fighter jets fly past during the procession today the aerial show of strength was designed to show @entity2 's military prowess , something @entity205 is keen to reinforce after the rocket flop last week @entity2 is in the midst of two weeks of celebrations marking @entity28 's birthday and the upcoming 80th anniversary of the @entity50			1
but it has also become a showcase of @entity11 's new era of leadership , with @entity28 giving the world a taste of his foreign policy by firing the rocket friday in defiance of outside criticism			1
in a surprise admission , @entity2 's state media announced hours later that the bid to send a satellite into space was a failure			2
condemnation abroad was swift , and the launch - using the same type of rocket technology used for firing a long - range missile - raised concerns that a nuclear test might be next			0
the finale in sunday 's military parade was the new long - range missile			1
military analysts in @entity106 and @entity236 said further examination is needed to determine whether it was a new intercontinental ballistic missile that @entity2 reportedly has been building			2
order : not a foot is out of step as @entity50 soldiers march during the massive celebration highly choreographed : @entity2 soldiers take part in the mass parade soldiers carry an image of @entity2 's founder @entity28 , whose centenary they were celebrating today ' dear leader ' : @entity2 soldiers carry an image of their late leader @entity19 during the mass parade in @entity42 the exact design could not immediately be confirmed by @entity50 officials			1
@entity256 , a @entity2 military expert at @entity106 's @entity257 , said the missile appeared to be new but strongly resembled the rocket used on friday and also the long - range @entity260 , which @entity2 first launched , unsuccessfully , in 2006			1
he said it probably has three stages but did not appear to be big enough to have the 15,000 - kilometer ( 9,000 - mile ) range needed to effectively attack the @entity171 , which would be the goal of an icbm for the @entity2			0
judging from the size of the soldiers in the background , its length appeared to be more than 30 meters ( 100 feet ) , which would also be about the same or possibly a bit bigger than the rocket used on friday			0
men in white from @entity2 's march just two days after a satellite launch timed to mark the centenary fizzled out embarrassingly when the rocket apparently exploded within minutes of blast off and plunged into the sea @entity2 soldiers march in front of flower waving civilians in a show of strength			1
but how leadership of the rogue state will fare in the coming years remains to be seen military pilots in blue goggles , matching medals and black boots shout as they march past the podium during the military parade today ' i do n't think this is a serious @entity266 , ' @entity256 said			0
' putting it on display has a psychological impact , and that would have been greater if friday 's launch had worked			0
but @entity2 has a very bad record with long - range missiles			0
it think this is more a propaganda ploy than a military advance			0
' a number of @entity2 at the parade said it was the first time they had seen the new missile			2
@entity11 said in his speech that the era when nuclear arms could be used to threaten and blackmail his country was ' forever over			0
' ' superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists , ' he said			0
@entity11 's speech was ' an expression of confidence , ' said @entity319 in @entity236			2
' @entity11 is trying to dispel lingering doubts about his grip on power			0

@entity11 called for strengthening late father 's ' military first ' policy before tens of thousands at @entity42 's main square
said he is ' *heartbroken* ' the rival *koreas* have been divided for decades , and ' will *cooperate* with anyone ' who wishes for reunification
