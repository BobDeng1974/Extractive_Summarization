by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 fell in the final round of qualifying at the @entity5 for the second straight year			0
the @entity7 number two has been in arguably the best form of his career and arrived in @entity10 at a career - high ranking of 131			0
he looked to have a golden chance to complete his set of grand slam main draw appearances against world no 205 @entity18 , but it was the @entity20 who came through 6 - 1 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 2			1
heading home : @entity23 's @entity2 suffered defeat in @entity5 qualifying to @entity18 @entity2 made a faltering start and comprehensively dropped the first set to the consistent @entity18			2
he fought back well in the second and they had played one game of the third when rain began to fall and kept the pair away from the court for two hours			2
it was an untimely break for @entity2 and he never got going on the resumption , throwing in a poor game to be broken for 3 - 1			1
in the stands : @entity23 @entity39 captain @entity38 watches @entity2 go out at @entity40 @entity18 was denied victory on his first match point by the umpire 's over-rule but took his second to clinch a deserved win and a spot in the main draw of a grand slam for the first time			1
it has been a disappointing qualifying tournament for the @entity7 players , with the other four entrants all losing in the first round			0
@entity2 must now hope for withdrawals from the main draw that would give him a chance of getting in as a lucky loser			0
@entity60 's @entity59 defied cramp and missed opportunities to defeat @entity63 and qualify for the main draw of the @entity5			0
it is the first time the 27 - year - old has come through qualifying at a grand slam and there was no shortage of drama on a packed @entity72 8 at @entity40 during his 0 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 victory .			1

@entity2 was beaten 6 - 1 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 2 by world no 205 @entity18 , of @entity20
the @entity77 fought back to level the match after dropping the first set
@entity2 never got going againt after a two - hour rain delay at the start of the third set
it means @entity86 is the only @entity7 player in the men 's singles draw at @entity40
