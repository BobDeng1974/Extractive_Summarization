by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:38 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 22 april 2013 @entity3 ’s housing crisis could be solved by the humble bungalow , according researchers at @entity7 ’s favourite think tank			2
planning rules must be torn up to encourage developers to move away from tiny box flats to investing in low level living , @entity9 said			1
but today it emerged that government reforms designed to stimulate the construction industry had actually slowed down the planning system			0
low level living : the popularity of the bungalow , like this show house in @entity22 in @entity23 , soared in the 1930s and 40s but just 300 - a - year are now built it is thought more single storey houses would persuade older people to downsize , freeing up more family homes and kick - starting the housing market			1
it could even stop people emigrating from the @entity3			0
almost a third of people say they would prefer to live in a bungalow but they account for just one in 50 of all properties across the country			2
four years ago just 300 bungalows were built in the @entity3			0
@entity9 believes planning rules which demanded at least 30 homes be built on every hectare of land made bungalows unviable			1
it calls for councils to lose control over granting planning permission , instead allowing local people to decide what can and can not be built in their town or village			2
residents could be more willing to support a wave of new bungalows , because they are less likely to impact on views			0
in 1923 the @entity55 featured a @entity56 , which took over a whole floor of the show the government 's attempts to shake - up the planning system have proven controversial			2
moves to allow homeowners to buold larger extensions without permission hit the buffers after opposition from @entity69 mps			0
now figures show that fewer planning applications have been given the go ahead since the coalition introduced its new @entity74			0
among developments of 10 or fewer homes , just 68 per cent were given approval within eight weeks in 2012 , down from 71 per cent in 2011			2
for larger developments it has fallen from 60 per cent to 57 per cent for the target of approval within 13 weeks			0
@entity83 ’s shadow planning minister @entity82 told the @entity84 : ' in reality planning applications are now taking longer to decide and , unsurprisingly given planning was never the brake on growth the government claimed it was , the economy is still flatlining			0
' following the government ’s botched planning reforms we have a situation in which many areas are unprotected by local plans , @entity83 ’s brown field first policy has been fundamentally weakened and key environmental protections are being ripped up			0
' we were sold all of this on the basis that it would speed up planning and boost the economy			0
' the bungalow has been a regular feature at the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 since it began in 1908 now the government is being urged to encourage developers to build more bungalows to inject demand into the housing market			1
the idea of using bungalows to solve a housing problem is not new			0
the term is thought to date back to 1659 , an anglicised version of a single - storey @entity120 hut called a ' bangala ' used to house @entity122 sailors			1
@entity3 's first bungalow was built by @entity124 who erected a lodge with @entity120 features in @entity127 in @entity128 in the 1860s			0
in 1882 pre-raphaelite artist @entity130 became one of the first people in @entity122 to die in a bungalow			0
they took off in the early 20th century in the @entity3 and @entity135 when they were adopted by the @entity137			0
fashionable for much of the first half of the century , they featured widely in the @entity55			0
bungalows became more popular in @entity3 after the @entity141 , with thousands of prefabricated properties built during and after the @entity143 to house returning soldiers and their families			1
they were updated with more stylish designs in the 1960s and 1970s , which have not dated well			0
a best - selling book in the 1970s was @entity150 , a self - build guide by @entity152			0
bungalows are said to be most popular in @entity154 , where up to 35 per cent of people say it is their dream home of choice			1
at the height of the 2007 financial crash it emerged that bungalows had held their value better than conventional houses			2
by june 2008 detached homes had dropped by 1.5 per cent and flats 2.9 per cent , but bungalows were down by only 0.6 per cent			1
older people who are reluctant to move out of family homes , even when children have moved away , could be persuaded to downsize to bungalows as a preferred way of living , the think tank believes			1
@entity173 , head of housing and planning at @entity9 , said ‘ what is needed is a grand bargain between the generations			1
‘ more homes , tailored to the needs of older homeowners , will help free up family sized properties for the younger generation			1
‘ it ’s unsurprising that many of our talented men and women are making new lives for themselves outside the @entity3			0
we must reform the planning system to get @entity3 building more homes			2
‘ this has to include more bungalows which will allow older people to downsize to a property that suits their specific needs			1
’ the new study - housing and @entity197 – points to a 2002 study which found that 30 per cent of people said they would like to live in a bungalow			1
‘ this preference is even stronger for older people , ’ the report added			1
the @entity204 noted : ‘ the majority of house buyers are unlikely to initially choose to live in higher density developments ... older people say they would prefer a bungalow			1
’ surveys by @entity210 also reveal bungalows to be @entity3 ’s ‘ happiest homes ’ , with people favouring the ‘ facilities such as security , cleaning and ease of use ’			1
the @entity9 report added : ‘ if thirty per cent of people ’s ideal home is a bungalow , and this preference is even stronger for older people , it make no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock			1
‘ older people currently living in large family homes might want to downsize to a bungalow , which is smaller and easier to maintain , as well as being on one floor and offering outside space			1
‘ there are huge numbers of spare rooms in homes older people are currently living in			1
what are needed are the homes that older people like and so would like to move into			1
‘ but planning policy prevents these homes from being built – and this is before we even begin to discuss the fact that higher land prices caused by our planning system would in any case mitigate against building bungalows			2
’ the prime minister 's official spokesman said he did not know if @entity7 's views on bungalows but insisted the government was committed to a raft of measures to boost the housing market			0
this @entity258 ' @entity257 ' from 1963 was designed to recast the bungalow as being at the cutting edge of modern living the @entity9 think tank believes a new wave of bungalows could help to solve the housing crisis , by encouraging older people who live in large family homes to downsize a spokesman for the @entity268 said : ‘ we are pulling out all the stops to get more homes built for all generations and we 're determined that good design will be the cornerstone of that			1
‘ our reforms are making the planning system much more accessible and by putting local decisions centre stage we are encouraging development that protects our countryside and responsible building			0
‘ the new neighbourhood planning powers we 've introduced ensure that local communities decide on the homes they want in their area			2
these changes are already paying off with a number of plans looking to provide more homes for the older generation			2
’ almost a third of people say they would prefer to live in a bungalow but very few have been built since the boom in the 1940s when prefabricated homes went up quickly bungalows are still popular on the @entity299 and in large parts of @entity154 the style of bungalows has been updated over the years , with many designed by owners as self - build projects last week the government was forced to u-turn on plans to overhaul the planning system			1
homeowners will keep the right to complain about neighbours ’ plans for large extensions			0
the move is a major climbdown after @entity7 last year promised ‘ fast - track ’ applications to kick - start the economy through building			0
property - owners were to be given the right to extend as far as 26ft without planning permission or opposition from adjacent families , but conservative and @entity326 backbenchers warned it would pit ‘ neighbour against neighbour ’			2
a revised scheme means homeowners will still have to notify their local council .			0

more single - story homes would encourage older people to downsize
@entity9 think tank hopes it would free up houses for families
just two per cent of properties are now bungalows
planning rules force developers to pack plots with dwellings
