a massive @entity1 satellite is expected to plummet down to earth monday - and no can predict with accuracy where exactly its debris is going to land			1
@entity1 's @entity7 , or @entity7 , was just 99 miles above @entity8 and dropping at a rate of 8 miles per day , operations manager @entity6 wrote in a status report posted on the @entity12 's website			1
‘ re-entry into the atmosphere ( is ) probably less than two days away , ’ @entity6 said			0
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) claims one of its sleek research satellites , dubbed the ' @entity17 of space ' has plummeted somewhere into the @entity19 the 1.2 - ton , $ 466million science satellite built by @entity22 and @entity23 engineers was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity8 's gravity , and now it is doomed by its force			1
scientists assemble the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet 's crust and mantle , among other projects			0
full name : gravity field and steady - state @entity38 launched : 17 march 2009 launcher : rockot ( with @entity44 upper stage ) by @entity45 launch site : @entity47 , @entity48 nominal life : 20 months cost : $ 466million orbit : about 161.5 miles altitude , polar , @entity52 - synchronous mass : 2,000lbs dimensions : 17.4 feet long , about 3.3 foot body diameter propulsion tank : 88.2lbs of xenon gas mission : measuring @entity8 's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution the arrowhead - shaped @entity7 ran out of xenon fuel on october 21 and has been steadily losing altitude since , tugged by @entity8 's gravity			1
the satellite was intended to orbit at 160 miles , but on saturday morning it hovering at just 105 miles			0
with its aerodynamic design featuring wings and tail fins , @entity7 has been called the ‘ @entity17 of space			2
’ most of the spacecraft will burn up as it blasts through the atmosphere , but up 25 per cent of the satellite is expected to survive re-entry and end up somewhere on the planet 's surface			1
@entity80 , senior science and technology editor for @entity81 , told @entity82 that earthlings have no cause for panic , but people should be ‘ a little bit worried ’ about the plunging pile of scorched space debris			0
‘ whenever you have one ton of hardware coming down , no one knows where , that 's not a good thing , ’ he said			0
with two - thirds of @entity8 covered by water and vast areas of sparsely populated land , the risk to human life and property is considered extremely low , the @entity12 said			1
rocket science : @entity7 is seen on show at the @entity107 @entity106 space facility before press day , on july 18 , 2007 space mission : @entity7 was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity8 's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution @entity80 explained that it is estimated that about 45 pieces of satellite debris , each weighing no more than 200lbs , will breach the atmosphere and land within a footprint of 190 square miles			1
‘ so a satellite would practically have to be aiming at your house to strike it , ’ @entity80 wrote in his friday @entity81 column			0
@entity126 : @entity80 , senior science and technology editor for @entity81 , said that earthlings should be ' a little bit worried ' about the plunging pile of scorched space debris due to constant changes in @entity8 's upper atmosphere , scientists can not yet predict where and when @entity7 will re-enter			1
satellites that are too bulky to bring down safely to @entity8 after they had served their purpose are sometimes boosted into one of the graveyard orbits more than 22,000 miles up , where they can hang around for centuries			2
for @entity7 , however , it was not a viable option because the satellite only has a small , weak ion engine on board			2
the last big satellite to fall back through the atmosphere was @entity48 's failed @entity150 @entity149 probe			0
the 14 - ton spacecraft re-entered in january 2012			2
in 2011 , @entity153 's 6.5 - ton @entity152 and @entity22 's 2.4 - ton x-ray rosat telescope re-entered			0
@entity156 , head of the @entity12 's space debris office in @entity22 , told the site spaceflight now that statistically speaking , it is 250,000 times more likely to win the jackpot in the @entity22 lottery than to get hit by a @entity7 fragment			1
about 100 tons of space debris falls to @entity8 every year , and so far there have been no reports of injuries of fatalities caused by extra-terrestrial scrap metal			0
in living color : in this handout image supplied by the @entity12 , a rendering of the variations in @entity8 's gravitational pull is shown as seen by the @entity1 's @entity7 satellite however , under @entity180 ’s @entity179 created in september of 1972 , should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry , the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable , @entity174 reported			1
the treaty , which has been ratified by 88 countries as of january 2013 , guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation			0
in the case of @entity7 , the satellite was launched from @entity48 , so that country would be on the hook for any damage .			2

gravity field and steady - state @entity38 , or @entity7 , was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity8 's gravity
@entity7 ran out of xenon fuel october 21 and has been losing altitude since
most of spacecraft will burn up , but 45 pieces weighing no more than 200lbs each are expected to survive
