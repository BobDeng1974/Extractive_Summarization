by @entity1 reporter published : 16:00 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 05:43 est , 21 july 2013 when a loved one needs help , perhaps during illness or long - term incapacity , stepping in to help is an instinct			1
six million @entity7 are carers to an adult , and every day a further 6,000 take on that huge responsibility			1
but where do carers find the help and advice they need when the often complex network of health and welfare services can be daunting ? to support them , the @entity16 has released a @entity17			1
here , in the first of three extracts from it , we explore the initial steps to becoming a carer ... providing a helping hand : six million @entity7 are carers to an adult , often a family member who suffers from a long - term health problem make caring a choice if your partner or parent needs care , your role as carer may develop gradually and unconsciously – but taking on the commitment ought to be an active decision			1
talk it over with family members and the person ’s doctor			1
consider how it will affect you and others in your household			1
it is important to discuss the situation with your family and make a decision together			1
you must consult the person needing care , too ; their approval will make your role in looking after them easier			2
know your rights it can be difficult to care for someone while also holding down a job , but most employees have statutory rights , including the right to request flexible working hours and unpaid leave in emergencies			1
your employer may offer you a sabbatical or part - time hours			2
anyone being cared for is entitled to a needs assessment ( also called a community care assessment ) to analyse their abilities and make sure they are safe			2
to arrange this , contact social services or the person ’s gp			2
helping hand : as thousands daily take on the job as a carer for an ill family member or relative , a manual has been released to help them get of the ground @entity85 most people needing care prefer to stay in their own home and familiar surroundings			1
an occupational therapist can advise how to make the environment safe and adapt the home			2
caring for someone from a distance is difficult but can be done – try to create an organised pattern of care that can be shared with other people			1
a telecare alarm system , which uses sensors around the home that will alert a call centre if the person has a fall , can reduce worry if someone lives alone			2
only move somebody in with you when you have fully thought through how well you get on , how your privacy will change and how much it will alter your lives			2
changed relationships the role reversal of caring for a frail parent can be distressing for both parties			2
similarly , becoming your partner ’s carer will change your relationship			1
it is normal to feel not just sad but angry and resentful because your future may not be the one you planned.caring for a friend or neighbour to whom you are less close can also feel awkward , especially if personal care is necessary			2
the most important thing in all scenarios is to find others to help , such as family members or social services			1
being uncomfortable can lead to resentment and harm the relationship			2

however short of time you feel , it is important you attend all your own medical appointments and keep track of your health			0
make sure you eat properly and that you get enough sleep			0
exercise can be combined with caring – find out about mobility scooters or wheelchairs if the person you ’re caring for ca n’t walk far			0
yoga and chair or floor exercises could suit you both and be done together at home			0
make sure you do n’t become socially isolated			0
set up a rota of people to visit you regularly and talk about your day and situation so friends understand better			1
