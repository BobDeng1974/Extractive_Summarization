i 've been romantically involved with several people who like them and each one of these relationships have ended badly			0
' my last boyfriend watched all of their shows and kept up with the celeb gossip surrounding them			0
he thought the @entity22 were fascinating			0
' at first , he found my fear funny and kind of cute			1
but over time , he wanted to talk about the @entity22 with me and of course , that 's not something i was really up for doing			1
' we had a big argument once when he demanded to watch the latest episode of ' keeping up with the @entity22 ' whilst i was with him			0

he explains , ' although my mates are supportive , they always make fun of my fear and play practical jokes on me			2
' once , my friend put a picture of @entity0 on his bathroom door so i could n't go to the loo all night			1
it was unbearable ! ' another time , one of my mates got drunk at a party and chased after me with a photo of @entity0 's ' @entity205 ' on his mobile phone			1
' they find it hilarious but they do n't realise how traumatic it is for me			0
i wish i was n't scared of the @entity22			0
' dr @entity210 , a @entity211 at @entity212 , says : ' it is unusual for someone to have this type of phobia			2
' the common phobias are social phobia , agoraphobia and fear of spiders , snakes or aircraft flights			1
' it is possible to develop a phobia of almost anything			2
there does not necessarily have to be a well - defined traumatic experience as there has been in this case			0
' usually the main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy			0
this helps the person unlearn the unhelpful thinking patterns which are causing them to get so anxious in the relevant situation			0
' the patient can be shown practical ways of reducing anxiety when it starts to occur			0
avoidance of the situation only makes matters worse and needs to be discouraged			0
' it is important that things are done step by step			0
for example therapy here might start with seeing a picture of the celebrity briefly and learning how to limit the anxiety it causes			0
watching a programme with the celebrity in it would be a task towards the end of therapy			0
' we only have a snippet of information here			0
depending on the full picture , it may be that an antidepressant is appropriate			0
antidepressants are all anti-anxiety as well so you do not necessarily have to be clinically depressed to benefit from one			0
' usually discussing the origins of a phobia is not useful			2
it is a bit like coming upon a car crash and studying the skid marks rather than helping the injured driver			0
this particular case is unusual			0
it sounds as if the patient â€™s own sexuality may be an issue and it probably does need to be discussed			0
