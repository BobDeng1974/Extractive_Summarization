by @entity0 published : 21:17 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 12:44 est , 29 november 2012 for many children the daily trudge to school is bad enough , but spare a thought for these youngsters and their parents as they make their way to lessons			1
pupils at the newly - opened £ 4million @entity11 primary school in @entity12 have to wade their way through a mud - bath because no pedestrian footpath was built			1
comparing it to the scene at the end of a rainy festival , parents have reacted angrily to the lack of a proper access route to the school			1
the primary only opened on monday and following heavy rain the track to the school has churned up making children filthy before they arrive and parents with buggies barely able to get there			1
@entity32 , three , looks down at her muddy shoes as she is walked down the path by her mother , @entity35 ' @entity36 ' : mother - of - two @entity37 , 31 , @entity32 , 3 and @entity39 weeks , make their way along a muddy path leading to the brand new @entity42 which opened on monday new : the £ 4million school only opened its doors this week , but already parents have hit out at the lack of pedestrian access for pupils and their parents mother - of - two @entity37 , 31 , said that taking her three - year - old daughter @entity32 to school for her first day today would be a nightmare			1
she said : ' it 's a mudbath , it 's like the end of a music festival			0
' there are people without cars who have to walk to school and they wo n't be able to get there			1
you need wellies and waterproofs it 's so bad			0
' you 've got no chance if you 've got a pushchair as well - the wheels would get stuck			1
' it 's a complete oversight			0
they spent all that money on the school but did n't think how people could get there			2
' tough terrain : mother @entity37 , pictured , says that her and three - year - old daughter @entity32 will have to don wellies and waterproofs to get to school the new school has been built with larger classrooms , a hall and forest school areas and dedicated food technology , music and science facilities			2
the move has seen two existing schools - @entity89 and the nearby @entity90 - merge to form a single primary			2
plans for the school were criticised when approved in october last year by the local highways authority and local ramblers who said that excessive car parking provision would encourage a dependence upon cars to get pupils to school			2
councillor @entity102 said that @entity103 are looking for a short - term solution to the problem			0
he said : ' we fully appreciate the concerns of parents about the current condition of the path that leads to the school and i have been working with officers in our countryside service , the parish council and the landowner to provide a short term improvement to the path that will help parents and children get to and from the new school safely			2
' @entity103 described pedestrian access to the school as being along a ‘ rural footpath ’			0
@entity11 is an ' @entity124 ' meaning that it is owned by @entity125 rather than the county council			1
the @entity125 acquired the land for the new school and subsequently the local authority supported the trustees through their planning application and gave some funding for the new build			0
the council said that a condition of the planning permission submitted by the trustees of the school to @entity138 ( the planning authority ) was to provide improvements to the footpath accessing the rear of the school and this work should have been completed by the applicant			0
@entity103 said a landowner , understood to be a garden nursery adjacent to the site , has now pledged to carry out improvements to the path			0
' like the end of a festival ' : the path , running alongside neighbouring nursuries , is the only pedestrian access to the new school site bigger : @entity156 cost £ 4million to build and has seen two smaller local schools merge			0

wheels of prams get stuck on walk to @entity11 primary school
@entity12 school only opened its doors for the first time on monday
