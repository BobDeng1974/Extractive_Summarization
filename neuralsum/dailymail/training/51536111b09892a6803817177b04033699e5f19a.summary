when two young ladies on a day trip to a @entity4 amusement park in 1915 threw their message in a bottle into the water , they probably never gave a second thought to someone finding their note generations later			1
yet just a day after it was revealed a diver from the state found the treasure 30ft down on the @entity18 bed , present - day descendents of the girls have now been found			1
@entity19 received a phone call on tuesday morning from her cousin @entity21 who had seen the story about their grandmother , @entity23 , who was 23 - years - old on the day the note was written			1
traveled through time : @entity23 , one of the young ladies who wrote the message in a bottle that was found on the bed of the @entity32 river @entity19 : the granddaughter of @entity23 received a phone call early yesterday morning from her cousin to tell her about the note that had been recovered from almost a century ago ms @entity23 was one of the two @entity38 girls who wrote a message nearly 100 years ago			1
she along with her friend @entity40 , who was 17 at the time , decided to commemorate their day out with their message in a bottle			1
the message read - ' having a good time at @entity48			2
' the note contained the girls names and their respective addresses			2
they tossed it into the @entity18 and watched it sink as both girls enjoyed the summers day visit to @entity58 on @entity59			2
' it ’s like she came back to life , ' @entity19 , 46 , of @entity60 , said			2
' it ’s exciting stuff			0
' mr @entity65 , 59 , of @entity66 said @entity23 had three sons and six daughters , of whom two daughters are alive and living on opposite coasts of the @entity71 there are nearly three dozen grandchildren across the country and he is now making it his business to get in touch with as many as he can find to inform them about the find			1
' i could n’t believe it , ' he said			0
' a part of me said , ‘ there ’s the old - school way of doing a text message			2
’ i thought it was pretty impressive			0
' ms @entity23 was born in september 1893 to @entity87 and @entity88 , as the youngest of nine children and married @entity90 , a saloon - keeper , just two years after her bottle - throwing day			1
she was a ladies ’ hat maker but the couple found time to have nine children - the youngest of whom is still alive			1
message in a bottle : nearly a century ago , @entity40 and @entity23 of @entity38 wrote a simple note as they enjoyed a day at a popular amusement park on @entity59 gone but not forgotten : they stuffed the message in a bottle , corked it and threw it in the waters of the @entity18 , where it sank to the bottom where it lay for 97 years to be discovered the bottle is expected to be donated to the historical society ’s museum on the island			1
' what ’s surprising is it was n’t yet completely silted over or dredged or an anchor destroyed it , ' @entity65 mused			0
' for that to be around that long and found is really , really incredible			2
' neither @entity21 or @entity19 , who is the 31st grandchild , recalled grandma @entity23 talking about @entity58 or leaving the message in a bottle			1
ms @entity19 said @entity23 had a ' really rich , interesting life ' and that she ' got chills ' when she read the incredible story of the bottle and the connection to her grandmother			1
' it just gave me goose bumps , ' she said			0
@entity23 was apparently a lovely lady who enjoyed green tea and fish , often cooking for the family at the summer house in @entity134			2
her grandma would come to her childhood home every holiday and often on sundays			0
unfortunately , @entity23 ’s youngest child who is still alive , is unable to appreciate the historical find because she has @entity141 ’s			1
hot fun in the summertime : @entity58 was an amusement park in @entity144 , @entity4			0
opened in 1897 , it closed in 1951			0
the writers of the message in the bottle had spent the day here a bygone era : @entity58 offered visitors an escape from the oppressive heat and humidity of packed , sweltering @entity38 in the summertime			1
@entity58 had picnic tables , a baseball diamond , swings and rides , as well as a casino and a dancing pavilion since hearing about this special ' tale across time ' , several descendants have got in touch with @entity167 , president of the @entity168			0
he set himself the task of finding the families of the original writers			2
the message from @entity23 and @entity40 was written in pencil on the back of a @entity177 deposit ticket			1
it even included the writers ' addresses on @entity181 and @entity182 , about nine blocks apart , in @entity38			2
thanks to the @entity186 and the @entity187 , several people have been attempting to connect the dots and he has received more than a dozen phone calls and emails in just 24 hours			0
most of the information has so far been about ms. @entity23 with very few leads on the whereabouts of ms @entity40 's decedents			1
the timing could n't be better however , because next month a special ' @entity199 ' event is going to be held on the island			0
@entity48 was a popular amusement park on @entity59 , but it closed in 1951			0
it was a favorite summer destination for @entity38 with a dance hall , amusement rides , bathhouse and swimming beach			0
this summers event will celebrate days from a bygone era when the famed @entity48 steamship docked daily at the park in the early 1900s , allowing passengers who boarded in @entity38 to enjoy all that the park had to offer			0
that message - ' having a good time at @entity48 ' - was found almost 97 years later by diver @entity217			1
' there ’s all kinds of people connecting the dots , ' @entity167 said			0
' i think it ’s wonderful			0
' heyday : this female reveller was just one of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who came to @entity58 before it closed in 1951 bringing in the crowds : steamships from @entity38 and @entity231 , @entity4 made frequent trips to @entity59 fun in the sun : rides ( left ) and swims in the river ( right ) were great summer activities for the visitors widely known : @entity58 was a popular tourist attraction until it closed in 1951			0

@entity23 was one of two girls aboard the @entity242 and wrote the note on june 30 , 1915
ms @entity23 went on to marry , have nine children and became a hat - maker
the message was still intact *inside* the bottle when found 97 years later
historical society has now managed to find descendents of the writers
