@entity0 is running for president , unless he 's engaged in a method - acting experiment to prepare for a movie role – as a senator who 's running for president by channeling his preacher father			1
at the @entity10 , the @entity9 @entity8 senator boomed a reaganesque sermon complete with g - rated jokes , scripture references – ' you shall know them by their fruits – and an altar call of sorts			1
' text the word " @entity19 " , ' he implored , to a specific number			2
it was an @entity22 - like organizing stroke that no one else at the saturday conservative cattle call thought of			1
but then no one else shouted with with consistency that occasional moments of normal volume were packed with whisper - like drama			0
love him or hate him , @entity0 is a powerful communicator			2
the @entity32 graduate has a debating award named for him there			0
he worked without notes and hired hands followed his departure from the stage by re-erecting the omnipresent teleprompter			0
he was one of only a few speakers who asked for it to be moved out of the way			0
' @entity66 bless the great state of @entity47 ! ' @entity0 practically exploded back once his applause calmed			1
@entity47 rep. @entity69 brought two dozen speakers to @entity71 for the one - day event , including firebrands @entity73 and @entity75 , and outsiders @entity76 and @entity78 , and perennial candidates @entity79 and @entity81			2
' @entity69 and i spent all week in @entity83 , ' @entity0 said of his @entity47 host			1
' so it 's great to be back in @entity52			1
' it 's an old joke , one that @entity0 has told for more than a year at public gatherings			1
but it was new to this audience			0
just like his constantly recycled story about what to do with the hated @entity93			2
' there are 110,000 employees at the @entity93 , ' he said saturday			1
' we need to padlock that building and put every one of those 110,000 on our southern border			1
' hallelujah : sen. @entity0 played religious fervor to the hilt in @entity71 on saturday , peppering his speech at the @entity10 with @entity104 - rated jokes the idea , he said , was to put illegal immigrants face to face with the thing @entity52 fear most – an army of @entity93 agents – and send them screaming back to @entity111			1
the senator knows his crowd , and he held them like a practiced sermonizer and let his @entity50 hang out			0
at the mention of @entity119 three - quarters of them applauded			0
' from the beginning of this country , ' @entity0 said , ' @entity66 's providential bessings have been on the @entity52			1
' he credited the almighty for beating the @entity124 , sewing @entity52 back together after a bloody @entity125 and defeating @entity126			1
'' when we stood up with @entity129 ... it was only with @entity66 's blessings that we saved freedom , ' he said , he torched the @entity132 for suing the @entity133 over their anti-obamacare civil disobedience			1
' if you 're litigating against nuns , as the @entity22 administration is , you 're probably doing something wrong , ' @entity0 snarked			1
and at the end of a story about how he helped organize 50 @entity142 pastors to stand with five others whose sermon notes were subpoenaed by the city government , @entity0 was a trumpet on legs			1
' @entity148 has no jurisdiction over the pulpit , ' he preached			0
' when you subpoena one pastor , you subpoena every pastor			0
' his biggest applause line – one that brought the crowd to its feet en masse , was a call to strip @entity52 citizenship from @entity52 who ' take up arms with @entity163 , ' the @entity161 terror army			1
but most of his stump material was in the vernacular of the church - going			0
his own redemption story involves his father , who abandoned him and his mother in @entity173 and moved to @entity142 alone			0
cruz the elder later found @entity66 and then returned to raise his son and regain his marriage			2
he 's now a pastor			0
he might also be the senator 's greatest political liability – his @entity179 – catnip for the political left			2
@entity142 , we have a problem : @entity185 @entity184 ( left ) , the senator 's father , has made statements in the past that could come back to haunt his son 's presidential ambitions the @entity47 event brought together two dozen big conservative names including @entity193 , @entity81 , @entity79 , @entity73 and @entity75 ( pictured ) ' socialism requires that government becomes your god , ' pastor @entity184 said in 2013 at a family summit			1
' that ’s why they have to destroy the concept of @entity66			2
they have to destroy all loyalties except loyalty to the government			0
that ’s what ’s behind homosexual marriage			0
' in 2012 he told a tea party meeting in north @entity9 that president @entity22 should be sent ' back to @entity213 , back to @entity214			1
' ' we have to unmask this man , ' @entity0 's father continued			1
' this is a man that seeks to destroy all concept of @entity66			2
and i will tell you what , this is classical @entity225 philosophy			0
@entity226 very clearly said @entity227 requires that we destroy @entity66 because government must become @entity66			2
' the senator 's flavor of this rhetoric is less blunt , more constitutional			0
' our rights , they do n't come from government , ' he said saturday			0
' they come from @entity66 almighty			2
' that 's his segue to ' abolish the @entity93 ' and reduce tax filings to ' a postcard			1
' and to tense foreign affairs			0
' you can not fight and win a war on radical @entity248 terrorism if you 're unwilling to utter the words " radical islamic terrorism " , ' he said			0
and those 9/11 hijackers ? ' they were n't a bunch of ticked - off @entity253			0

at the @entity10 , he boomed a reaganesque sermon complete with scripture references and an altar call – just send a text *message* !
@entity0 had spent all week in @entity83 , he told a @entity71 crowd , ' so it 's great to be back in @entity52 '
he said the @entity52 should close the @entity93 and post all 110,000 employees on its southern border – an army of tax agents to scare illegal immigrants
his biggest applause line was a call to strip @entity52 citizenship from @entity52 who ' take up arms with @entity163 '
@entity0 's father is a *controversial* preacher who advocated sending @entity22 ' back to @entity213 ' and said gay marriage is about abolishing @entity66 from the public arena
