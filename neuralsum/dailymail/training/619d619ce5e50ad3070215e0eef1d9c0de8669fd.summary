jockey @entity0 will replace a suspended @entity1 on the key @entity3 - period rides of @entity4 in @entity5 and @entity6 in the @entity7			1
@entity8 , who owns both @entity10 - trained geldings with wife @entity11 , confirmed he would be using @entity10 ’ no 2 rider and not searching for a big - name replacement after emotionally welcoming his resurgent @entity15 winner @entity14 thinking at @entity16			2
@entity4 is 10 - 1 for the @entity5 with sponsors @entity17 after winning the @entity18 at @entity19 and finishing second to @entity20 in the @entity21 at @entity22 while @entity6 is 8 - 1 second favourite to follow up last month ’s @entity24 win at @entity25 at @entity26 on december 20			1
@entity0 will replace suspended jockey @entity1 in two of the key @entity3 - period rides @entity1 is ruled out because of the 12 - day suspension he picked up at @entity30 on friday for taking the wrong course			1
@entity8 , who won the 2012 @entity32 with @entity4 when it was switched to @entity33 , said : ‘ i am very sorry for @entity1			1
he made a mistake but we are all human			0
we have a good jockey in @entity0 – he is a cracking rider			0
we will just have to hope the ground both suits @entity40 and @entity4			1
’ @entity8 punched the air as if he had won the @entity43 as he led @entity44 thinking to the @entity16 winner ’s enclosure			0
like @entity4 , 11 - year - old @entity47 , who had produced a career best steeplechasing performance when landing the @entity50 at @entity51 on his penultimate run , is riding on the crest of the wave being generated by the in - form @entity10			1
@entity8 , who saw his winner ’s brother @entity57 finish second on his @entity59 debut on friday , added : ‘ if we had only been able to solve @entity47 ’s breathing problem , which we have never done , he would have been exceptional			0
’ wishfull thinking made virtually all under @entity1 , jumping with real spring in his hooves , but he was arguably lucky			1
@entity64 - trained @entity63 had hit the front when losing all momentum under @entity67 at the last fence			2
@entity1 was given a 12 - day suspension at @entity30 on friday for taking the wrong course some bookmakers quote @entity14 thinking for the @entity5 but he is likely to have a ‘ long rest ’ and be brought back for a spring campaign			1
similarly , @entity43 quotes about @entity74 , winner of the @entity76 at @entity77 for trainer @entity78 and jockey @entity79 , seem equally redundant			0
@entity78 said his preference would be to go direct to the @entity25 in march to run in the shorter @entity81			0
returning @entity43 winner @entity82 did as well as could be expected with his third place behind @entity74 , finishing strongly over the inadequate two and a half mile distance			0
meanwhile , @entity86 presenter @entity85 will not be the only absentee from @entity51 on grand national day next year after preferring to cover the first televised woman ’s boat race instead in her much scaled - down role			2
@entity92 doubts he will let saturday ’s @entity94 winner @entity95 take his chance at the age of 14			0
his dual @entity5 winner @entity99 , however , has @entity51 on his agenda and is about ‘ six to eight weeks ’ off returning to trainer @entity101 as he recuperates from injury .			2

@entity1 is suspended for two of the key @entity3 - period rides
@entity107 will replace him in two races
@entity107 will ride @entity4 in the @entity5
he will also ride @entity6 in the @entity7
