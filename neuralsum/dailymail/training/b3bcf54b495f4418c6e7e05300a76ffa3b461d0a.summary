@entity1 's 2 - 1 extra time win over the @entity2 made them the eighth group winners to see off their respective runners up at the last - 16			1
it is the first time in the tournament 's current format that there have been no upsets at this stage - with all eight of the table toppers meeting in the quarter finals			1
here , @entity15 looks at how all eight made it through against the sides they showed as inferior both in the groups and in the first knockout round			1
last - 16 opponents @entity31 can give anyone a good game though and @entity35 were lucky to make it through on penalties			1
they have had to rely on the goals from @entity48 , who is now carrying an injury , to mask some questionable defending			0
@entity32 finished above @entity51 / beat @entity52 2 - 0 in the last - 16 arguably the tournament 's most impressive side so far			1
topped their group easily with nine points from nine available and then comfortably saw off a @entity52			0
but now though they face the tournament 's toughest task in the form of play hosts @entity35 on home territory			1
jumping for joy : @entity64 will be making an appearance in the last eight - watch out @entity66 together : @entity66 will be underdogs against @entity68 but that has suited them so far @entity68 finished above @entity31 / @entity70 2 - 1 in the last - 16 impressive starters in the group , @entity68 beat world champions @entity74 5 - 1 before seeing off @entity75			1
their win against @entity31 was almost a non-fixture before facing @entity36 in the last - 16 where it became much more difficult			0
late goals from @entity81 and @entity82 just about dragged the @entity83 through in normal time			0
@entity66 finished above @entity52 / beat @entity51 5 - 3 on penalties ( 1 - 1 draw ) in the last - 16 it 's fair to call the rest of the sides listed here ' favourites ' but @entity66 certainly have not been at any stage of the competition			1
just looking at group winners and runners up ignores their brilliant group finish above long - established nations @entity96 and @entity98			2
they then beat @entity51 on penalties after holding out with 10 men for almost an hour			0
yes ! @entity103 's fans celebrate their qualification in the streets of @entity106 after beating @entity107 super eight : @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 have all scored for the @entity112 @entity103 finished above @entity113 / beat @entity107 2 - 0 in the last - 16 the @entity103 have been experimenting with playing star striker @entity114 in the middle and wide - when they have favoured the latter they have often been devastating			2
@entity107 looked like they could cause the @entity103 to implode after frustrating them for long periods but their patience and firepower eventually made the difference			2
@entity125 finished above @entity2 / beat @entity126 2 - 1 in the last - 16 a battle with the @entity103 in the @entity128 now awaits after @entity125 saw off plucky @entity126 in the last round			1
they opened their campaign brilliantly with a big win over @entity133 but have since occasionally stuttered			0
the win over @entity126 showed some defensive frailties but when @entity111 is on top form they can be hard to stop , too			0
made it : @entity138 and his team - mates are down to the last eight we 're through ! @entity1 's players celebrate their win @entity143 finished above @entity107 / beat @entity113 1 - 0 in the last - 16 @entity138 has four man of the match awards from four games at this @entity147 - and that is effectively @entity150 's story so far			1
@entity138 scored four of their five goals in the group as they overcame @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity107 - and he then had to rescue them by laying out @entity159 's late extra time winner against @entity113			2
@entity1 finished above @entity126 / beat @entity2 2 - 1 @entity160 in the last - 16 the @entity22 have somehow won all of their games so far but arguably had their reputation tarnished			0
a lack of attacking football and the fact they have just spent a total of just 52 minutes ahead in all of their games has made them look unimpressive			0
but they showed against the @entity2 that they still have plenty of firepower , forcing @entity173 into a record 15 saves			0
they could potentially be coming into form at just the right time			2
@entity177 leave it late again			0

red devils are the eighth table toppers through to the quarter finals
first time it has *happened* since groups led *straight* to knockouts in 1986
@entity35 , @entity32 , @entity68 , @entity66 , @entity103 , @entity125 , @entity143 all force their way past against group runners - up too
@entity15 looks at how they all made it through to form the last eight
