@entity0 has demanded @entity2 launch surprise inspections in @entity3 of @entity5 border checks in a fresh escalation of tensions between @entity8 and @entity9			1
ministers want the @entity11 to make unannounced visits to assess the legality of border checks which have been blamed for long queues to enter and leave the @entity15			1
the row has been simmering since last summer when @entity5 suggested a £ 43.50 fee could be imposed on anyone wanting to cross the border with the @entity0 territory			2
in november , @entity11 inspectors found the checks were within the law and said @entity0 should work with @entity5 to bring down tobacco smuggling and other border crime			1
however , the @entity37 has raised doubts about the report because it was based on inspections agreed in advance with the @entity5 authorities			0
with the draconian checks still causing ’ significant ’ delays and hitting the local economy , @entity44 officials are being urged to travel to the border without giving @entity9 prior warning			2
‘ we want them to go back and carry out more inspections but without arranging it in advance , ’ said a government source			0
there is also growing anger in @entity57 over @entity5 ships making incursions into @entity61 waters			1
the number of unlawful incidents doubled from 229 in 2012 to 496 in 2013			0
figures released in response to a parliamentary question show the number of incursions into @entity61 waters has more than doubled in a year already this year from january to may there have been 185 incursions , latest figures show			1
as a result the @entity5 ambassador has been summoned three times to explain the aggression , most recently on april 2 this year			0
earlier this year a @entity5 warship had to be escorted off @entity0 territory by @entity79 's patrol boat , @entity80 , after it entered the waters near @entity3			1
@entity44 minister @entity82 is expected to travel to @entity3 within the next month to discuss the problem the boat allegedly used a fake name and call sign , and refused to leave by its own accord at it claimed it was in @entity5 waters , local media said			2
the vessel approached as @entity0 @entity93 personnel from the @entity95 's @entity94 were carrying out training jumps into the sea			0
government insiders suspect that the @entity5 aggression towards @entity3 is in part designed to distract attention from its domestic problems , including high unemployment and public anger at allegations of corruption			2
@entity44 minister @entity82 is expected to travel to @entity3 within the next month to discuss the problems			0
he has admitted that the government is ’ concerned ’ about the impact that border delays are having on businesses in both @entity5 and @entity3 ' the delays imposed by the @entity5 authorities at the border with @entity3 continue to have a significant impact , resulting in significant changes in behaviour at the border : visitor arrivals in @entity3 are down and vehicle traffic has fallen , ’ he said in response to a parliamentary question			1
’ since the beginning of the disruption last summer , the government has raised this issue regularly with the @entity11			0
’ the @entity0 government has sent a dossier on the border delays to @entity5 ’s director general for @entity130			1
it has also asked the @entity11 to ’ make follow - up visits to monitor the continuing delays ’ , mr @entity82 added			0
’ we continue to request that the @entity11 urge @entity5 to act on their recommendations and return border checks to reasonable and proportionate levels			0
