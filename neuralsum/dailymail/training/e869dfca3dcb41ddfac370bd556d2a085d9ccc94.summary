when her mobile phone was stolen , @entity0 thought she would never see it again			1
that was until she logged on to the internet and saw someone had been taking selfies – using her handset			2
the poser , a pouting brunette who bears an uncanny resemblance to the victim , had apparently not realised the phone was programmed to automatically upload photos to miss @entity0 's online account			1
after sharing the pictures with her friends – along with a request to ' find this tramp ' – miss @entity0 has managed to track the woman down and pass her name to police			1
after accidentally getting into an unlicensed taxi , she promptly fell asleep			0
when she woke , her handbag – containing her house keys , driving licence and @entity23 – was missing			0
the taxi driver insisted miss @entity0 did not have the bag with her when she got into the cab in @entity43 , @entity44			1
but she reported the theft to police the following day			2
a week later , on @entity46 , she noticed new photos appearing in her @entity26 account of a striking brown - haired woman			1
incensed , miss @entity0 posted them on @entity51 with a message asking her followers to help her ' find this tramp '			1
@entity0 , pictured left and right , had her phone stolen from a taxi in @entity43 and she reported the theft to police the following day			1

miss @entity0 , from @entity63 in @entity64 , said : ' i was with friends when we saw loads of selfies of this woman coming through			1
' i thought ' what the hell ? ' at first , we laughed and thought it was quite funny			0
she posted loads of photos of her earrings , which we thought must have been a @entity33 present			0
but then i thought ' she should n't get away with this '			0
' i 'm quite angry that i 'm now left with an @entity79 , while she has my lovely @entity79 5c			0
' i decided to share it on @entity51 and have had hundreds of responses – including from @entity82			2
' then someone who knew the woman in the photos got in touch and told me who she was			0

using a feature on the social networking site , she found out the selfies were taken at the @entity98 shopping centre in @entity43			0
miss @entity0 , whose phone was worth around £ 500 when she took out the contract eight months ago , added : ' she now knows i 'm trying to track her down and she 's taken the selfies off @entity51 and changed the settings so you can no longer see her location			1
' implying the woman might be planning to flee the country , she added : ' i saw friends on her @entity51 ( page ) had posted ' i hope you have your passport ' after i shared her photo			2
' miss @entity0 said the incident had left her worried about travelling alone			2
