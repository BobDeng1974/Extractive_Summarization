the law replaces capital punishment with a sentence of life without parole			1
' with the legislation signed today , @entity4 has effectively eliminated a policy that is proven not to work , ' @entity3 's office said in a statement			2

a mistake can not be reversed if an innocent person is put to death , the statement added			0
five other states - @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 - have repealed capital punishment since 2007 , according to the @entity47			1

multiple states had bills pending to abolish the death penalty but it was unclear which might be the next to overturn it , @entity50 said			1
among possible contenders is @entity111 , where the single - chamber legislature turned down a repeal bill in march by one vote			0
the @entity116 @entity115 this week moved to speed up executions by sending to governor @entity119 reforms designed to keep condemned inmates from spending decades on death row			0

@entity135 , a political analyst at @entity70 's @entity136 , said @entity3 's progressive stance , including the death penalty repeal , could help him if he decides to run for president in 2016			1
