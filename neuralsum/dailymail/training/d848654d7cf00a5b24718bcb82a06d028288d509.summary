shock : our ability to deal with a financial crisis may reduce as we get older our ability to make sound financial decisions peaks at 53 and then declines , a study claims			1
academics at @entity9 said cognitive performance declines in the mid- 50s because we lose our ability to solve new problems			1
it also warned that by the time pensioners reach their 80s , half will have serious cognitive impairment which renders them unable to make good financial choices			1
there was bad news for the young too – they may also struggle to make an important decision about their money because they do not have the financial knowledge acquired through experience			2
it follows a recent study by the @entity30 which found that one in five over- 55s could not choose the better deal from two financial products			2
separate research by the @entity35 found men ’s memory remained stable until they reached 60 to 64 , after which it declined			1
@entity39 , the government ’s older workers champion , who also studied at @entity9 , claimed the latest research was ageist			1
‘ everybody is different so there is no point in making stereotypes , ’ she told the @entity42			0
‘ there are plenty of people in their 80s who are still very mentally capable			2

@entity78 , at @entity72 , said that people should plan what to do with their nest egg in their 50s when their mental capacity to manage money is in a ‘ sweet spot ’			0
there are no products that allow this kind of forward - planning yet .			0

@entity9 academics said performance declines in mid- 50s
half of those in their 80s have serious impairment to financial decisions
it follows separate research finding *similar* trend in men over 64
