the sight of millions of stars would be enough to humble most people - never mind experienced photographer @entity3 , who made a six - hour round trip to capture this incredible panorama of the @entity6 on a bitterly cold night			1
dressed in a thick jacket and boots , the 42 - year - old drove from his home in @entity11 , to @entity12 off the @entity13 just after 1am on a mission to capture something very special			1
there he set up his @entity17 , complete with a wide - angle lens , and took eight carefully - planned shots which he digitally stitched together after he returned home at 7am - to a full day 's work in his other job as a web designer			2
the conditions had to be just right - with clear skies , low tides , no moon and winter conditions - before he could take his eight images which he painstakingly stitched together as the @entity6 emits so little light compared to factors like streetlights , the moon and the glow of sunset , the freelance photographer had to plan his photo carefully			1
' an image such as this requires lots of variables to be in place including the right time of year for the @entity6 to be seen off the east coast , ' he said			0
' it was a bitterly cold night , ' said mr @entity3 ( pictured )			2
' i needed a big winter jacket , winter trousers , big boots , gloves , hat and of course my flask of coffee ! ' ' this tends to be during february through to mid may - any later with the early rising sun , you get to much ' sun ' pollution in the night sky at around the time you 'd expect to see the @entity6			1
' no moon , as the moon sheds too much light into the night sky and of course clear skies			1
' on the night of his visit in march , he figured out the moon would be setting at 3.30am - just in time for the @entity6 to rise			1
then there was the tide - with its famous @entity75 which can be seen in the background , @entity12 is detached from the mainland and could only be reached via a narrow causeway when the water was low , at 2am			1
and lastly , there was his one - year - old grandson , who mr @entity3 put to bed and left with the rest of his family before creeping quietly out of the house			1
' it was a bitterly cold night , ' said mr @entity3			2
' i needed a big winter jacket , winter trousers , big boots , gloves , hat and of course my flask of coffee ! ' he set up his camera on a tripod and using a head torch , he cast light on the upturned fisherman 's boats in the foreground for his 28 - second exposures - something which drew some unwanted attention from the police			0
an officer crossed over to the island and questioned him			0
' i guess a strange man stood out by the boat sheds with a head torch is a bit suspicious ! ' he said			0
' he was suitably impressed when i showed him a couple of the images from the back of my camera			0
' he added : ' at 5.30am after packing up , i headed back home - stopping off at @entity117 for a well deserved breakfast and cappuccino , eventually arriving back home at around 7:30am - ready to start a regular day 's work ! ' i did n't even look at the images on the @entity123 until around lunchtime , at which point i was bouncing with joy over what i 'd captured			0
' streetlights could not be avoided entirely - the yellow light to the left of the award - winning shot is from the town of @entity134 , while the right hand side shows @entity136			0
but mr @entity3 said : ' i ’m utterly over the moon with the final images and people ’s reactions have been extremely complimentary			2
' it ’s been my best - selling piece of work to date			0
the image really comes to life when you see it as a large , high - quality print			0

@entity3 , 42 , put his one - year - old grandson to bed before driving out to the @entity12 of @entity12
conditions had to be just right - with the moon setting , stars rising , clear skies , low tides and winter weather
