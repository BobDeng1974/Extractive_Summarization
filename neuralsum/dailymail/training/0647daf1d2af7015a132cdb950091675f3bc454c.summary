the doe , which had been swallowed whole by the monster gator , was likely 3 years old and weighing more than 100lbs , according to the @entity21 taxidermist			2

the clan have brought their scaly catch to mr @entity8 to skin and stuff it so it could ultimately be put on public display			0
the taxidermist laid out the gargantuan gator measuring 70.5 inches around the stomach on the floor of a large work shed and cut open its midsection , which turned out to contain the badly deteriorated deer corpse			1
@entity59 told @entity60 the dead doe had no hair , owing to alligators ’ powerful stomach acid , but much of the cartilage and all four hooves were intact			1
the taxidermist , who performed the so - called necropsy on the gator at the request of biologists , estimated that the reptile must have wolfed down the doe about a week before its fateful encounter with the @entity75 family			1

‘ i 've looked at the stomach contents of a lot of alligators and have never seen a squirrel in any of them , ’ he told the newspaper			0
@entity98 speculated that the animals may have fallen into the river during a storm and ended up in the gator ’s maw			0
other items that @entity8 discovered while rummaging through the contents of the slain gator 's belly included bones from a water bird ; skull plates from other deer ; big rocks ; molars from a small cow , and a heaping portion of greenery			1

the beast was captured by five members of the @entity11 family near @entity139 early saturday			1

@entity11 said her crew went through the full range of emotions as they first staked the animal , before battling it , then killing it and finally struggling to take it back to shore			0
and the fierce gator did n't go down without a fight			0
after the family got some large hooks into the gator , @entity11 aimed her 20 - gauge shotgun at the ‘ sweet spot ’ behind the alligator 's eyes			1
that 's where she was told to aim during a mandatory training class for @entity6 gator hunters			2
she pulled the trigger , but the gator 's head was too far beneath the water 's surface			2
‘ all it did was make this gator mad , ’ @entity11 told @entity60			2
‘ @entity176 had taken hold at this point			0
" the gator surged forward and towed the 17 - foot boat and its five passengers across the creek at a startling speed , the hunters said			0
the towing continued until the boat crashed into a tree stump in the creek , sending the crew spilling on top of each other			0
eventually , @entity11 got another shot			0
‘ he came up just as calm as he could , ’ @entity11 told @entity60			0
‘ when i pulled the trigger this time , water just exploded on all of us			0
’ they tied the gator to one side of the boat and hugged the opposite side so it would n't tip over as they made an hour - long trek back to their truck			2
when they finally got the beast back to dry land , he was so big that he crushed the winch system normally used by @entity210 and @entity212 biologists			0
