in her @entity28 diary she reveals how she was weighed down by her rucksack , filled her gloves with snow and put her crampons on wrong			0
her ' strikingly handsome ' guide @entity119 exclaimed at her incompetence : ' it is a * * * * * * * joke , @entity2			2
' @entity121 of @entity123 's sister has been signed up as a columnist by @entity126 magazine , but readers have complained her first offering - an @entity129 feast - was difficult to prepare she and @entity0 have more in common than ties to the @entity131			0
both are high profile columnists , @entity0 earning a reported £ 250,000 - a - year from the @entity134 while @entity2 was recently signed up as a recipe writer for @entity126 magazine			1
