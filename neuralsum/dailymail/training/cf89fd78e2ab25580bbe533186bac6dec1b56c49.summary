adding to their distress was the fact that the @entity3 government ' changed the stories every week ' , with the couple first told he was killed in a @entity7 air strike on a mosque			2
the couple wants to know what proof the government has that their son was a member of @entity18			0
' everything the government is saying , it 's all hearsay , there 's never been one ounce of proof given to us by any department of the government to prove that he was or he was not a terrorist , because they do n't want to , ' mr @entity36 said			0
mr @entity12 's step - father @entity36 ( left ) and mother @entity61 , from @entity19 in @entity23 , say they ca n't get closure until the @entity3 government gives them more details about their son 's death ms @entity61 wants to know exactly how her son died			1

the documents show confusion over whether @entity100 , a joint @entity3 - @entity16 muslim convert who was killed in the same drone strike as mr @entity12 , was also linked to @entity18 with one document saying mr @entity100 was only ' probably ' associated with the group			1
another document says the pair were members of @entity18			0
mr @entity12 moved to @entity7 in 2011 , three years after converting to @entity21 following a troubled past			1
