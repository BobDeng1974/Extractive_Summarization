at some point during our journey , it occurs to me that holidaying with two boys under two , a husband who will have to abandon us after a couple of days for a business meeting , a sleep - deprived couple with a 12 - week - old baby and one bouncy bachelor is not wise			2
@entity14 airport does not help			1
it is dirty , cramped and hot			0
the car hire area is awash with irate parents , screaming children and lashings of eau d’armpit			0
then an accidental circuit of the entire @entity14 ring road does not add to our general joie de vivre			1
on @entity14 's doorstep - but you 'd never know : @entity27 boasts hilltop citadels such as the lovely @entity29 but if anything can soothe frazzled nerves , it is the sweeping lawns , cool interiors and extraordinary calm of @entity36			1
villa specialist @entity37 has some splendid properties on its books			0
but this one - an 18th - century farmhouse in @entity27 - is glorious			1
it ’s awash with pale greens , creams and soft yellows			0
none of these are colours you would ever think of putting together - and yet they are so pleasing to the eye , we all want to rush home and start redecorating			2
outside , we find lawns , roses , fig trees drooping with fat weeping fruit , a discreet swimming pool			0
all of it is utterly and splendidly isolated , in a clearing on top of a hill , up a long rutted track and through a 250 - hectare forest ( a bit @entity65 at night )			2
the owners have even left us firm instructions to shut the gate , to keep the wild boar out of the swimming pool			0
@entity27 , bordering @entity70 and @entity71 in the north and @entity73 in the south , is n’t a trendy part of @entity76			1
@entity77 does n’t have a villa here			0
not a bad spot to while away a week : @entity80 stayed at the splendid @entity36 what you do see is real @entity76 hanging out their washing , drinking amazingly good cappuccinos outside petrol stations , doing their weekly shop and commuting to work in the medieval city of @entity88			1
possibly even popping to the thermal springs at @entity90 for a dip on the way home			0
there ’s much to do , too ; a relief , because a baby - heavy week in a villa needs breaking up with the odd outing to prevent cabin fever			2
toddler time : the villa was a great base for a holiday with @entity80 's two sons ( both under two ) for one member of our party , a daily trip to the spectacular cheese counter at the supermarket in @entity110 is enough to keep him happy			0
never has one man bought and consumed so much burrata — a delicious combination of mozzarella and cream that means ‘ buttery ’ in @entity76			1
by his third visit , the manager is rushing out to greet him , and buyers are dispatched far and wide to find richer , creamier burratas			0
for those who are more cultural - minded , @entity14 is an easy possibility , just 60 miles away			1
but if , like us , you ca n’t face the ring road again - even for a glimpse of @entity129 and a quick pizza - then the fortified hilltop town of @entity124 is a great alternative			1
only 30 miles away , and a hop and a skip from beaches and endless gelaterias , it ’s also reputedly @entity76 ’s oldest city , founded by the @entity138 in the 12th - century @entity139 it is largely unspoilt by tourism , and boasts the most magnificent necropolis imaginable			1
here , more than 6,000 graves are cut into the limestone , at least 200 of them painted with jaunty scenes — supposedly to make the dead feel at home when , as was firmly believed , they awoke in the afterlife			0
vast banquets , naked servants , sexually explicit acts and extraordinary revelry - they give more than a taste of the @entity138 ’ brilliantly naughty lifestyle			2
in contrast , our own revelries at @entity36 seem a little tame - though i doubt even the @entity138 could have challenged us over the consumption of burrata mozzarella			2
@entity163 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity14 from @entity164 and @entity165 , from £ 78 return			1
@entity167 ( 020 7563 7902 , www.cvvillas.com ) offers a week at @entity36 , sleeping up to ten , from £ 2,385 to £ 4,655 .			0

@entity27 is the @entity76 region which surrounds the national capital @entity14
it is far less known to @entity174 visitors than the likes of @entity70 and @entity71
the *picturesque* hilltop town of @entity124 is a must - see stop for tourists
