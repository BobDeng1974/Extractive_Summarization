while racism is thought to be rife in the @entity5 @entity4 states , a new ' hate map of @entity1 ' reveals prejudice to be common elsewhere			1
the map suggests that the coal region and rust belt in the @entity4 , along with the @entity10 , have now become the most racist areas of the @entity4			1
the rust belt straddles the upper northeastern @entity4 , the @entity13 , and the @entity15 states , while the coal region is found in @entity17 and the spine of the @entity19			0
the map revealed that clusters of racism appeared in areas of the @entity24 , @entity26 's @entity25 , and a large portion of @entity28			1
racism ( in red ) in the @entity31 states , along with @entity32 , were two of the most surprising discoveries for the researchers racism is rife in the coal region in @entity17 and the spine of the @entity19 , according to the map			1
racism is also common in the ' rust belt ' which straddles the upper @entity4 , the @entity13 , and the @entity15 states			2
the map revealed that clusters of racism appeared in areas of the @entity24 , @entity26 's @entity25 , and a large portion of @entity28			1
racism in the @entity31 states , along with @entity32 , were two of the most surprising discoveries for the researchers			1
searches for n * * * * r are less frequent in regions west of @entity53			1
the map based its results on @entity56 â€“ a technique previously used by data scientists to understand how racism may impact @entity61 's electoral chances , according to the @entity62			1
' @entity64 data , evidence suggests , are unlikely to suffer from major social censoring , ' @entity68 data scientist , @entity69 , wrote in an earlier paper			2
he added that @entity64 searchers are online and likely alone - both of which make it easier to express socially taboo thoughts			2
asking someone about racism in a traditional survey rarely works , says @entity69 , because people may lie , and often , racism can operate on a subconscious level			0
as part of the study , researchers at the @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity68 looked at searches containing the slur n * * * * r. they found that it was searched for frequently , as often as , for instance , ' economist , ' ' sweater , ' and ' @entity96 '			1
the map revealed that clusters of racism appeared in areas of the @entity24 , @entity26 's @entity25 , and a large portion of @entity28			1
racism in the @entity31 states , along with @entity32 , were two surprising hotspots for racism			2
searches for n * * * * r are less frequent in regions west of @entity53			1
the researchers on the @entity111 paper found that racist searches were linked with higher death rates in black communities			1
' results from our study indicate that living in an area characterised by a one standard deviation greater proportion of racist @entity64 searches is associated with an 8.2 per cent increase in the all - cause mortality rate among @entity125 , ' the authors wrote			1
the map looks strikingly similar to a recent a map of racist tweets made by researchers at @entity130			2
students studied 150,000 geocoded tweets sent out between june 2012 and april 2013 containing 10 pre-selected hate words in three categories : racism , homophobia and disability the map looks strikingly similar to a recent a map of racist tweets made by researchers at @entity130			2
students studied 150,000 geocoded tweets sent out between june 2012 and april 2013 containing 10 pre-selected hate words in three categories : @entity135 , homophobia and disability			0
researchers discovered 41,306 tweets containing the word n * * * * r , 95,123 referenced ' homo ' , among other terms			2
while racism may appear rife in the @entity4 , a separate study found that overall , @entity152 countries are the most accepting of other cultures			0
the data came from the @entity155 , which measured the social attitudes of people in different countries			0
below are results of the countries that are the least tolerant : 40 % + ( of individuals surveyed would not want a person of another race as a neighbour ) @entity165 , @entity166 30 - 39.9 % @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 20 - 39.9 % @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , the @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 tweets that included the slur n * * * * r , were not concentrated in any single region in the @entity4			1
instead , there are a number of pockets of concentration , including @entity192 , where 31 users sent out 41 tweets referencing the word , and @entity196 , @entity197 , where there were 22 tweets containing the slur			2
perhaps the most interesting concentration comes for references to ' wetback ' - a derogatory term used for illegal @entity206 immigrants			0
most tweets containing the offensive term came from several parts of @entity53 , which surprisingly are not even close to the @entity206 - @entity4 border			0
while racism may appear rife in the @entity4 , a separate study found that overall , @entity152 countries are the most accepting of other cultures with @entity215 , the @entity216 more tolerant than anywhere else			0
the data came from the @entity155 , which measured the social attitudes of people in different countries			0
the country with the highest proportion of ' intolerant ' people who wanted neighbours similar to them was @entity166 , where 51.4 per cent of the population would refuse to live next to someone of a different race			0
@entity230 was @entity165 with 43.5 per cent			0
racist views are strikingly rare in the @entity4 , according to the survey , which claims that only 3.8 per cent of residents are reluctant to have a neighbour of another race			0
