@entity1 prosecutors are investigating claims that organs were illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research			1
the bodies were then reportedly buried as paupers in a @entity24 , @entity10 this is despite no ' proper ' efforts having been made to locate relatives and obtain their consent , prosecutors told the @entity30			1
prosecutors launched an investigation last november after family members complained they had not been contacted before their loved ones were buried in @entity24			2
they discovered 3,000 people possessing documents clearly identifying them could have been illegally buried in mass graves , marked only with numbers , as paupers over the past 15 years			1
in these cases , the deceased had died in the street or a public hospital - and their bodies had not been reclaimed by relatives within 72 hours			2
the organs were allegedly sold for research purposes despite no ' proper ' efforts having been made to locate relatives ( file picture ) shockingly , some of these bodies may have been buried with few - if any - organs , say prosecutors			1
the @entity9 , run by pathology teachers from one of @entity1 's most prestigious universities , says it has since improved its procedures , but denies any illegal activity			0
however , during their inquiry , prosecutors were told by two witnesses that organs had been illegally taken from unidentified bodies and sold for medical research			1
they currently have no material proof to back up the allegations			0
dr @entity67 , the @entity9 's director , told @entity68 that the service operates ' within the law ' and has no legal obligation to locate relatives of bodies taken to its premises			2
he said the deceased are ' generally ... buried intact ' , adding : ' there are specific situations in which organs are used , but always with the purpose of being used for research			2
' but where patients ' bodies are not claimed , that does not happen			0
' dr @entity67 said the service now collects detailed information about bodies - including photos of the deceased and their fingerprints and tissue fragments - before passing it on to the police			0
in 2010 , hundreds of thousands of @entity96 were caught up in an @entity98 blunder that saw organs being taken from dead patients and used without their consent			0
donors who expressly stated they did not want certain body parts taken after their death had their details changed so their records showed any of their organs could be removed			0
more than 21 bereaved families were contacted by health officials to be told the disturbing news that tissue was mistakenly taken from their loved ones			0
the error , which affected 800,000 people , happened when details concerning the body parts that donors do not want to be removed was deleted from the @entity117 .			0
