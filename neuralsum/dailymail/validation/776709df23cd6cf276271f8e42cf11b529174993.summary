the classic advice was given to me first by no less a figure than @entity3 — then aged 90 — at one of her bizarre lunches to launch yet another romantic novel			1
she was busy rattling off a roster of men who had proposed to her over the decades , when she broke off and fixed a skinny guest with her gimlet eye			1
‘ after 40 , ’ she told me , ‘ a woman has to choose between her face and her figure			1
my advice is , keep a lovely , plump pretty face , and stay sitting down			1
as she got up again and started working the room , distributing souvenir gold - leaf acorns from her garden and finishing the list of long - deceased suitors — the object of her remarks , a skinny fellow journalist , scowled and fiddled with her lettuce			1
i — past 40 by then — smiled my chubbiest , most complacent smile			1
it ’s not often my tribe get our bums and faces validated over those of grumpy glamazons			1
in @entity48 's ( pictured in the 1960 's ) memoir she merrily admits to putting on more than 2st over the past 15 years now , that face - and - figure tip has been reiterated by @entity20 , former model , actress and @entity55 nominee , whose memoir @entity57 will be published soon			1
in it , 68 - year - old @entity20 merrily admits that over the past 15 years she has put on more than 2st			1
‘ i am a champion eater			2
no carb is safe , ’ she joshes			2
food is fun , she believes , and it is ridiculous and sad that her contemporaries either starve or vomit in secret to stay stick - thin			2
@entity20 sounds a riot , just the girl for a grand night out			1
she also sounds — and here ’s the key — confident and sexy			2
none of that weird , skeletal , @entity70 or @entity71 vibe for her , nor that gristly , hard - body @entity73 look , all abs and biceps			1
oscar nominee @entity20 ( pictured ) is confident , sexy and fun , despite putting on more than 2st over the last 15 years her brand of femininity , which is shared by domestic goddess @entity79 , is a bounce and a grin , a wink and a cuddle			1
the buxom woman ’s image may not suit the gay - dominated fashion industry or the anxious self - hating celebrity circuit , but children ( and , frankly , most men ) gravitate towards the comfortable female form			2
both have an entirely natural instinct to bond with a female who seems fun , comfy , confident and able to enjoy her food			2
@entity20 and @entity79 's healthy , curvy figures differ from the tiny frames of celebs such as @entity71 ( pictured ) and @entity70 indeed , scientists lately delighted us with news that the particular sort of fat on the female backside is rather special			1
it is vital for the formation of the healthy foetal brain in pregnancy			2
so any cheek from your teenage offspring , and you can riposte : ‘ your brain is made out of my bum ! @entity115 ! ’ before the health - police start pursing their lips , i hastily say that by ‘ buxom ’ and ‘ comfortable ’ i absolutely do not mean obese			2
there is a clear line to be drawn between the chub of the healthy and vigorous middle - aged and the vast jelloid spread of the clinically obese			2
domestic goddess @entity79 ( pictured ) has a curvy figure and a healthy face , she shares her fun , comfortable brand of femininity with former model @entity20 this is not about those sad whale - forms who wheeze and waddle and risk diabetes ; who ca n’t fit in train or plane seats			1
of course , serious obesity needs help , or in the last desperate resort , gastric - band surgery			2
but that is quite different from the 2st - above - model - weight which @entity20 is talking about			1
we all know perfectly well when we are ladling on the lard in the wrong places : if sensible , we take action			2
there are times — post-pregnancy , doing double - duty as a working mum or just imprisoned by sedentary work and depression — when women ( and men ) cross the line			0
but we do know inwardly when that point is			0
that is quite different , though , from the neurotic , bulimic daily anxiety of struggling to be unnaturally thin , too skinny for your natural metabolism			0
of course , some wiry women stay very slim all their lives without giving it a second thought			0
it can be very annoying for cautious eaters to see these lucky freaks piling into the pies with no apparent effect			0
others enjoy engaging in such ferocious sports that they rarely put on an ounce			1
actress @entity70 ( pictured ) sports a skinny , skeletal figure , similar to that of @entity71			1
but @entity177 says there 's nothing wrong with some extra weight and curves but what about the rest of us ? as long as we walk our 10,000 steps a day , eat lots of veg , swim or bike or @entity191 and can nip upstairs and sprint for a bus , there ’s no problem with a bit of extra round the bum			1
or in having ( shock ! ) a stomach which is not concave , or thighs which occasionally meet			0
the upside , as @entity200 and @entity20 remind us , is that a woman ’s face does n’t become haggard so quickly ; her skin stays peachy and she wo n’t have that mean , cool , pinched , starved - weasel look so common on the social pages			1
rather , she exudes a contented , cheerful aura of enjoying life			0
she does not carry the quivering paranoia of one who is frightened of knives and forks , or sit with an agonised , tense expression in restaurants sipping mineral water and pretending not to be hungry			0
that ’s what makes many happy , rounded , smiling women attractive			0
the morbidly obese are n’t confident — how could they be ? but neither are those for whom every morsel , every pinch - of - an - inch , every dress size above 8 is a source of self - loathing			0
they have been conditioned to think they have no real right to take up space , and must keep a vulnerable adolescent skinniness all their lives			0
we can see here one memorable movie scene where @entity236 has her curves on display as she arrives at a garden party dressed as a bunny a lovely moment in the @entity243 movie is when she is counting calories and someone says : ‘ do n’t you need 1,200 or something just to live ? ’ and she realises it had never occurred to her before that food was actually necessary			0
it was , to her , just a reprehensible addiction			0
but you ca n’t go cold - turkey on food , so what you need is a cheerful relationship with it and your body			0
and if , as life goes on , some of nature ’s bounty settles as padding on your healthy active body , so what ? it ’s certainly nobody else ’s business			0
one of the most irritating eras in journalism was when @entity269 was first married , long before she blotted her copybook			0
the papers sneered ‘ @entity276 ’ and laughed at her broad - bottomed , bouncing shape , so far from @entity275 ’s fragile , bulimic slenderness			0
however , young @entity70 was active : a rider , a black - run skier , a sexy , larky happy girl			0
nothing wrong with her except an unfashionable shape			0
has she looked better , happier , jollier in her skinnier after - years ? i think not			1
papers were cruel to brand active @entity281 ' ( pictured ) in response to her broad - bottomed , bouncing shape so hurrah for @entity20 and her rollicking attitude to life			1
i find myself humming an @entity287 ditty we used to sing in the pubs of @entity290 , with the chorus : ‘ for she ’s a great big shtout lump of an agg - er - i - cultural @entity287 girl			0
she neither paints nor powders and her figure is all her own … ’ the last line rises triumphantly with a cry of ‘ the full of your arms of @entity287 love — is @entity298			0
whoopee ! ’ and i will bet @entity298 had a gorgeous , peachy , @entity287 face and the comfiest of backsides			0

former model @entity20 admits she has put on 2st in 15 years
many skeletal celebs end up looking haggard and starved
here , @entity177 offers her more *balanced* view towards eating
