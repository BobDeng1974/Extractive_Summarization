' that 's fine , ' she said			0
' this is a little shocking because of the number of babies that were killed , ' judge @entity40 added			0

investigators believe @entity7 is the mother of them all based on what she has told them but have ordered dna tests to make sure that 's the case			2
@entity7 's three daughters — one teenager and two young adults — also lived in the house			2
it could take weeks to get the results , @entity97 attorney @entity40 said			0
questions : @entity7 's youngest daughter , who is in junior high , was born during the same time period when she murdered her other babies and it is not clear why she was spared ( an unidentified person pictured above at the family home on monday ) ' how can you have a baby and not have evidence and other people know ? ' asked neighbor @entity111			1
' you ca n't plan when a baby is going to come			0
just the thought of somebody putting a baby into a box is a heartbreaker			0
' investigators believe @entity76 and @entity7 were together when the babies were born , but do n't believe he was aware of the killings			1
@entity40 said @entity7 is the principle suspect , but did n't rule out more arrests as the investigation continues			2
police declined to discuss whether @entity76 or the three daughters have been interviewed			0
under investigation : police were called to the house on sunday after her estranged husband found one of the dead babies after following a ' pungent ' smell in their garage breaking it down : many of the contents of the house were seen strewn across the front lawn on monday ( pictured ) as police continue to investigate the case heartbreaking : @entity7 and her estranged husband had three daughters together and some items from their childhood were seen on the family 's lawn as the investigation continued monday @entity76 pleaded guilty in federal court in 2005 to two counts of possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine , according to court records			1

' @entity166 said the couple married young , and @entity7 never worked except for a short stint at a grocery store			2
horrible job : an unidentified man was seen going in and out of the @entity54 house on monday the three daughters who were living in the house were good young women who have turned out remarkably well considering their father has been in prison , @entity166 and @entity111 said			1
@entity76 's parents have played an influential role in their upbringing , especially the youngest , who is still in junior high			0
@entity111 said she 's puzzled about why @entity7 would have killed the babies , especially considering her youngest daughter , now a young teen , was born during the decade @entity7 told authorities she killed the other babies			1
' why was one of them saved ? ' @entity111 said			0
most women who kill their children do so by neglect and or on purpose , such as @entity191 , the @entity192 woman who drowned her five children in her bathtub in 2001 , said @entity195 , a psychology professor at @entity197 's @entity196			0

thin : @entity7 , seen in this 2010 photo with two unidentified individuals , has reportedly admitted to giving birth and strangling or suffocating all of the children between 1996 and 2006 what she did : @entity7 has been charged with six counts of murder , but it is unclear why she has not been charged with seven since that many bodies were found @entity195 said the concealer is typically a teenager who does not repeat the act			1
' these are usually girls who are 17 , get pregnant , become scared to death and do n't want to tell their parents , ' said @entity195 , who has written about mothers who kill their children			0
' they 're not 30 - year - old women who can go have an abortion			0
' to combat this , all states , including @entity3 , have safe haven laws that allow women to drop off unwanted newborns to authorities with no questions asked			2
the mother can remain anonymous as long as the child has not been subject to abuse or neglect			0
in coming days , defense attorneys for @entity7 are likely to closely examine her background to search for any evidence of mental illness or a family history that would help explain the alleged killings , said @entity242 , who represented @entity243 at her criminal trial			2
defense attorneys also will try to determine whether @entity7 sought an abortion and if she told anyone about her pregnancies — all in hopes of understanding actions that otherwise appear incomprehensible , @entity242 said			2

is there a rational motive ? ' he said .			0
