by @entity0 @entity1 opened in @entity2 on tuesday , with the number of security guards on the city 's streets increased from 1,200 to 1,300 to protect students from violence			2
another $ 10 million from the state will mean 600 more workers will be lining the streets within the next several weeks children and parents made their way past security guards whose bright neon vests served as a reminder of the city 's efforts to combat crime			1
@entity20 walks her son @entity21 to school along a safe passage route as @entity1 community watch person @entity24 stands guard today it comes a year after hundreds more ' @entity29 ' workers were hired to keep children from harm , an infusion of city money has allowed @entity2 to increase the number of workers			1
the city is also raising from 93 to 120 the number of schools with @entity29 routes , said @entity37 , the chief safety and security officer for the @entity1			1
parents welcomed the sight of the @entity29 workers			1
' i like them on every corner , the police , too , ' said @entity46 , who was walking her five - year - old daughter , @entity47 , to school , the girl sporting a new @entity51 backpack and @entity53 shoes			0
' you feel a little safer			0
' the first day of school did not receive nearly as much media attention as last fall , when mayor @entity59 's shuttering of some 50 schools before the school year began sparked concerns that some students would be at increased risk of violence because they were required to cross into rival gang territories			0
the last school year ended , according to the school district , without a single student being seriously injured along any of the @entity29 routes while guards were on duty in the nation 's third - largest city			1
@entity75 and her son @entity76 walk a safe passage route along 63rd street on @entity76 's first day of kindergarten on tuesday in @entity2 @entity46 , left , and her daughter @entity79 walk a safe passage route along 63rd street on @entity47 's first day of kindergarten in @entity2 at the same time , a number of factors this year — from troubling crime statistics to the upcoming mayor 's race — will ensure that the program remains under a microscope			2
on tuesday , a day after the police department reported that the number of shooting incidents had climbed in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year , one mother said she worries that violence might erupt from the crowded street corners and bus stops she must negotiate to take her two young sons to school every day			2
' there 's no telling who 's out there , ' said @entity20 on her way to a train that she will ride with them for more than 20 blocks to their school			0
similar concerns were voiced by @entity107 , who was walking his nine - year - old son to nearby @entity109 , almost exactly a year after officials at the school took the unusual step of responding to shootings in the area and a gang member 's funeral by rushing students and staff off the property as soon as classes ended for five days			0
school children walk a safe passage route along 63rd street on tuesday in @entity2 school children walk a safe passage route along 63rd street as crossing guard @entity125 stops traffic tuesday in @entity2 ' i make sure i walk him ( because ) i know about the streets , what happens , ' @entity107 said			1
some worry that the city is not doing enough to keep students from harm , particularly students who must leave for school early in the morning , well before the @entity29 workers take their posts less than an hour before classes begin			1
last december , a 15 - year - old girl who left her home before dawn to get to a school on the city 's @entity144 was beaten and raped less than a half block from a @entity29 route			2
' she had to get to school earlier than the @entity29 ( workers ) were on duty , ' said state rep. @entity150 , who said he will push to use some of the $ 10 million from the state to extend the guards ' hours			1
all this could pose a political risk for @entity59 , who is up for re-election next year			0
his most - talked - about potential rival , @entity158 president @entity157 , has criticized @entity59 for closing neighborhood schools and dubbed him the ' murder mayor ' because of the city 's violence			0
any violence that occurs on a student 's walk to and from school could become fodder for @entity170 — or any other opponent — to use against @entity59 , whose popularity has fallen over the last year			0

the state has spent another $ 10 million to increase the number of guards
' @entity29 ' workers were hired to keep children from harm on their way to and from school
the number of safe passage routes will also increase from 93 to 120
