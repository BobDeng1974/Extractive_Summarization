many pensioners have annuities linked to @entity2 - scrapping it could have cut £ 10,000 off a pension over 20 years by @entity5 published : 18:12 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 11 january 2013 pensioners and savers were the big winners yesterday following a shock decision by the @entity10 not to scrap a key measure of inflation			1
in a move described by one expert as ‘ a mess ’ and ‘ a fudge ’ , the @entity10 said it will continue to produce the retail prices index method of calculating inflation even though it is inaccurate			1
it did reveal plans to publish a new measure of inflation , but this will not be used as a benchmark for any significant purpose			0
pensioners and savers were the big winners yesterday following a shock decision by the @entity10 not to scrap a key measure of inflation this means that @entity2 will continue to be used to calculate a huge number of things which affect the lives of every @entity31 , even though the @entity10 admits that it is not a reliable measure and is consistently higher than it should be			1
many pensioners have annuities which are linked to @entity2 and scrapping this link could have cut £ 10,000 off a pension over 20 years , experts had warned			1
the interest paid on certain index - linked investments is also linked to @entity2			2
but the fact that @entity2 will continue to be used to calculate price increases – such as for water bills and train fares , as well as the interest students pay on their loans – is likely to trigger huge political embarrassment and fury among consumers			2
in a move described by one expert as ' a mess ' and ' a fudge ' , the @entity10 said it will continue to produce the retail prices index method of calculating inflation even though it is inaccurate yesterday the @entity55 called on the government to switch to the new index , known as @entity2 , as a step towards getting rail fares ‘ under control ’			1
and @entity61 , senior economic adviser to accountant @entity63 ’s @entity62 , said : ‘ the @entity10 has come to a real fudge which does n’t solve anything			0
‘ what was already a mess has now become messier			0
’ he said the calculation of the @entity2 index is ‘ fatally flawed ’			2
@entity2 was introduced in 1947 and uses a way of working out average prices known as the @entity74 method			2
every country , including @entity76 , which used to adopt this method has scrapped it , apart from @entity78			0
@entity2 will begin to be published in march and uses the alternative @entity80 ’ method from which the @entity81 in the index title is derived			2
the method is named after @entity84 economist @entity80 who died in 1882 and proposed a different way of calculating indexes			0
but @entity2 will continue to be used for the interest on @entity89 ’ index - linked savings certificates in which some 905,000 savers have more than £ 25billion invested			1
@entity91 , the @entity92 , yesterday admitted that @entity2 ‘ does not meet international standards ’ and that ‘ @entity2 uses a better method ’			0
but the @entity95 said yesterday it will continue to use @entity2 for index - linked gilts , although @entity97 , economic secretary to the treasury , hinted that this policy might change in the future			1
pensioners should welcome this brave decision @entity103 , analysis among those who will be regretting the @entity10 determination to stick with the old formulation will be the chancellor @entity108 it is a long time since a decision against change had such a big impact on all our lives			0
a brave ruling by the national statistician @entity91 to leave the formula for the calculation of the retail prices index ( @entity2 ) unchanged has been given an enthusiastic welcome by financial markets and pensioner groups			1
it had been feared that @entity123 would cave in to political pressure for a new modern approach to @entity2 that would have lowered the measure of inflation , the level of annual increases to state pensions and therefore the bill to the exchequer			2
but when it turned out the opposite was the case , the price of @entity78 government stocks or gilts , which offer returns linked to inflation , climbed sharply and people dependent on state pensions or in company schemes also required to uprate each year by the retail prices index , can breathe much easier			1
if the @entity10 had chosen to replace @entity2 with something based on a more modern statistical formula then the annual increase in these pensions could have been cut by as much as 0.9 per cent a year			2
by holding the line on @entity2 , at a time when faith in pensions and the savings culture has been undermined by constant tax changes and government interference , @entity123 has struck a rare blow for stability and the independence of the statistical service			0
a change in the retail prices index at present might have destroyed the nation ’s faith in @entity162 does not mean that the @entity10 ruling will be regarded as an unalloyed success for everyone			1
one consequence is that utility and rail prices , that are currently set on the basis of a formula based on the retail prices index , will increase more speedily than would otherwise be the case			1
paradoxically , some elderly people could be particularly affected by this in that fuel bills tend to eat up such a large proportion of their disposable income			0
he @entity10 has , however , built itself an escape route			0
it plans to create a new measure of retail prices , @entity2 , that includes the same items as in the current retail prices index , but is calculated using a different mathematical formula			1
this will be published alongside the old @entity2 and , if divergence is significant over several years , the pressure for a new approach may become too much to withstand			0
among those who will be regretting the @entity10 determination to stick with the old formulation will be the chancellor @entity108			0
a change to a less generous measure of inflation would have saved the government an estimated £ 3billion a year in the interest it pays on index - linked gilts and other products			1
another group likely to be dissatisfied are companies locked into supporting final salary pension schemes that are adjusted upwards by @entity2 each year			0
at a time when the government is constantly changing inflation adjustments , for everything from benefits payments to pensions and wages in the public sector , the chief statistician has seen off the governor of the @entity210 sir @entity209 , the politicians and some of the experts .			0

pensioners and savers will see the benefits after the @entity10 not to scrap a key measure of inflation
it will continue to produce the retail prices index method of calculating inflation even though it is inaccurate
many pensioners have annuities linked to @entity2 - scrapping it could have cut £ 10,000 off a pension over 20 years
