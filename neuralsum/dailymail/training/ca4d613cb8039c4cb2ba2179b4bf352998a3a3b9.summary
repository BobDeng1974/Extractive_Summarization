by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 08:59 est , 15 december 2012 an eight - year - old girl with a football - sized facial tumour is to have pioneering surgery before it strangles her			2
the rare growth first appeared when @entity6 was four - and - a - half , and she twice underwent surgery in her home country of @entity8 to remove it			1
however , each time the bone tumour has grown back more quickly and it now weighs 4.4lbs			1
she is pictured ( right ) after her second operation in september 2011 in @entity8 since then @entity6 has lost sight in one eye due to the swelling and her teeth are being pushed out of place			1
fibrous dysplasia is a rare bone disease that destroys and replaces normal bone with @entity22 ( scar - like ) tissue			1
as the bone grows , the softer , fibrous tissue expands , weakening the bone and making it more prone to fractures			2
one or more bones can be affected and it can vary in severity			0
mild cases usually cause no signs or symptoms and develops during the teens			0
more - serious cases of fibrous dysplasia may result in bone pain and deformity and are more common in under - 10s			1
there is no cure for fibrous dysplasia			2
treatment focuses on treating signs and symptoms			0
the bone lesions may stop when the child reaches @entity48 / @entity47 now she will undergo a pioneering surgery at the @entity50 in @entity51			2
@entity53 experts will attempt to remove all of the benign tumour using the latest technology before reconstructing her face			1
the 15 - hour operation was made possible by @entity53 charity @entity59 , who flew @entity6 and her mother @entity61 , 30 , from @entity8 to the @entity53 for treatment			1
@entity63 , director of @entity59 , said : ' this is a massive operation undertaken by some of the best surgeons in the world			0
' we hope to be able to remove all the infected bone tissue which will save @entity6 's life and give her back her sight			1
' using advanced diagnostic and mapping techniques our doctors were able to pinpoint precisely the size and depth of the tumour			0
' without treatment there would be no hope for @entity6 , but thanks to the generosity of our patrons and the expertise of our surgeons , she has a chance			1
' @entity6 has @entity86 - a bone disease that destroys and replaces normal bone with fibrous bone tissue			1
mrs @entity6 says over the years she has watched her daughter 's face become almost unrecognisible			1
@entity6 stands outside @entity91 in @entity51			2
she flew to @entity51 with her mother for surgery thanks to the charity facing the world @entity6 and @entity61 the mother - of - three said : ' in the beginning it was like a small piece of bone sticking out of her face			1
' i thought it would eventually disappear - but it continued to grow			0
after the first operation the tumour grew back in just two months			0
' since then it 's taken over her face			0
i ca n't bear to see her like this but she 's been so brave about it			0
' following surgery the schoolgirl will be sedated and moved into intensive care - estimated to cost around Â£ 65,000			0
all surgeons involved are giving their time free of charge and @entity59 are paying for all of @entity6 and @entity61 's living cost - but are entirely dependent on public donations			2
each year facing the @entity119 help up to eight children with extreme facial disfigurements from all over the world			0
the charity was founded in 2002 by two craniofacial surgeons @entity125 and @entity126 after mr @entity125 met a young girl in need while volunteering in @entity129			0
