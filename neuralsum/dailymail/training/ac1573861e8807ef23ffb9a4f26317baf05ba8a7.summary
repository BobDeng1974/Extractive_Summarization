by now , the incident is passably familiar			2
the ruck had concluded , there was a small skirmish , and without warning , @entity4 of @entity5 and @entity6 smashed his elbow into the side of @entity11 ’s jaw			1
the @entity13 player collapsed , and @entity4 was sent off			1
at which point , certain characters in rugby union began to behave extremely foolishly			0
@entity17 , who is @entity5 ’s defence coach , declared that @entity4 was ‘ integral to our culture , ’ which says something for their ‘ culture ’			1
@entity24 , @entity4 ’s colleague for club and country , rallied his depleted forces with a fraudulent cry of ‘ @entity29 ! ’ but worse by far was the reaction of @entity31 , the club ’s director of rugby			1
he thought the whole affair was ‘ disappointing ’			0
he ‘ did n’t think there was any malice in it , ’ and he criticised @entity11 for going down ‘ pretty easily ’			1
in summary , he declared : ‘ it ’s a tough game , and @entity4 plays to the edge			1
you wo n’t change @entity4			2
’ he added : ‘ i ’m not saying that what he did was right			0
’ @entity5 hooker @entity4 wassuspended for three weeks by the @entity43 for a wild elbow @entity4 's incident came during a flare - up between @entity5 and @entity13 players during the first half @entity4 's elbow was caught by the @entity50 who reported the violence to the referee such a short statement to contain so much specious tosh ! there was the elbow thrown without ‘ malice ’ , the casual defaming of the stricken @entity11 , the macho garbage about rugby being ‘ a tough game ’ , the acceptance that the player is beyond reform , and that wonderful euphemism ‘ competitive ’			1
belatedly , he realised the ridiculous figure he was cutting and added the risible rider : ‘ i ’m not saying that what he did was right			0
’ now the ‘ competitive ’ man he was defending has a certain amount of ‘ previous ’ : a 26 - week ban for eye - gouging in 2007 , eight weeks for biting in 2012 , two weeks for punching in the same year , and 11 weeks for verbally abusing a referee in 2013			0
@entity4 now has another three - week ban to add to his wretched tally , the lenient sentence apparently partly due to his plea of guilty			2
in fairness a not - guilty plea might have provoked laughter in court			0
@entity4 is now available to play in the @entity87 , if the @entity6 coach @entity88 decides to select him			1
to his great credit , @entity89 has never lost touch with the grass roots of the game in schools and clubs			0
he is uncomfortably aware that many parents are deeply concerned about exposing their children to the physical dangers of a sport with an increasingly thuggish reputation			0
he is also aware that he has a responsibility to the game which far outweighs all other considerations			0
@entity89 has the chance to fulfil that responsibility by informing @entity4 that he has played his last game for @entity6			2
i dearly hope he takes it			0
@entity11 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) have words after the incident , as the @entity13 man is seen to by a physio referee @entity112 ( left ) had no choice but to show @entity4 a straight red card for his antics @entity5 hooker trudges off despondently after being sent off for his vicious elbow			1

@entity4 was sent off against @entity13 last weekend
@entity4 smashed his elbow into the side of @entity11 ’s jaw
but the @entity5 player will be available to play in the @entity87
@entity88 should take the opportunity to drop him
