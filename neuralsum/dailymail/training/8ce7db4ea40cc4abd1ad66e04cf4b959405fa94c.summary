by @entity0 wind turbines and solar panels have often been touted as the solution to the growing energy crisis , but could the answer really lie in the movement of water and air ? that ’s what one company based out of @entity11 thinks - @entity13 has recently been given permission to build a giant downdraft tower			1
known as the @entity17 , it would stand nearly half a mile ( 0.8 kilometres ) tall and generate as much power as the @entity19			1
the patented structure is comprised of a tall hollow cylinder with a water injection system near the top and wind tunnels containing turbines near the bottom the tower works by spraying water in at the top , making air heavy and causing it to fall , which causes 120 huge turbines to turn at the bottom			1
at peak operation , during a particularly sunny day , the tower can apparently produce 1,250 megawatt - hours - roughly equivalent to the power output of wind turbines spread over 100,000 acres			1
but the main advantage of this system , according to the company , is that it can run day and night and it does not rely on particular weather , such as wind or sunshine , to operate			0
downdraft technology is not entirely new , but the company claims they have an innovative new patent that makes it more feasible			0
one of the biggest drawbacks was the sheer size and cost of attempting to construct such a tower			0
but now they have been given permission to begin the funding and operation of the project in @entity61 , @entity62			1
the company also hopes to export the technology to other countries including @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity68			0
water is sprayed in at the top of the structure , which stands 2,250 feet ( 685 metres ) tall , almost twice the height of the @entity73			1
this causes hot air to become heavy , and it then falls through the tower			1
at the bottom of the tower are 120 turbines , with the ability to circulate 2.5 billion gallons of water			2
as it falls through the tower the air reaches speeds of up to 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) per hour			2
this runs the turbines and produces power , some of which is used to pump water back to the top			2
the exterior of the tower could also have ‘ wind vanes ’ that would capture wind and use it to produce additional electrical power			2
this makes it , according to the company , the first ‘ hybrid solar - wind renewable energy technology ’ on the market			0
the system can run 24 hours a day , but it does require large amounts of water			0
it also needs to be in an environment with hot air , which is why the @entity62 desert is ideal			1
one possible stumbling block could be the cost of the project , which is estimated to be about $ 1.5 billion ( £ 890 million )			0
however , @entity17 have been granted preliminary funding by @entity112 , which should make the project feasible			2
on their website , the company outlines their goal of eventually building multiple towers and providing a new source of renewable energy			0
‘ @entity119 will be constructed on location using conventional materials , equipment and techniques , associated industries , as well as local workers in the surrounding town or city , ’ they write			0
‘ each location will benefit significantly from the creation of professional manufacturing , construction and transportation jobs , in addition to having a high efficiency energy resource close by – providing clean renewable energy at a cost more favourable than nuclear plants with no negative impacts to the environment			0
’ at peak operation , during a particularly sunny day , the tower can apparently produce 1,250 megawatts per hour - roughly equivalent to the power output of wind turbines spread over 100,000 acres and about the same as the @entity19 in @entity144 ( pictured )			1

permission has been granted to build the @entity17
this huge structure will be based near the city of @entity61 , @entity62
the tower is half a mile tall and will be built in the *middle* of the desert
to generate power water is sprayed in and ' heavy air ' is circulated
this can apparently produce as much power as the @entity19
