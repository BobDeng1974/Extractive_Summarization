@entity0 launched the chemical attack which killed hundreds of people because he ' lost his nerve ' in a moment of panic and worried that @entity6 would fall to rebel troops , according to new intelligence			1
in a telephone call which was tapped by @entity13 spy chiefs , a senior @entity10 commander told the @entity15 embassy in @entity16 that @entity18 's president intended to tilt the balance of power towards the regime in the battle for control of the country 's capital			1
however , it appears that the chemical attack backfired , as it looks set to prompt a major intervention from @entity28 and @entity29 troops aimed at crippling @entity0 's military capabilities			1
@entity31 today spoke out to demand that the world take action against @entity18 , saying that the international community ' can not be silent ' over the use of chemical weapons			1
@entity53 today announced that it is sending a missile cruiser to the eastern @entity55 to enforce the country 's interests in the volatile region			1
pope @entity59 also entered the fray , attempting to slow the march to war by summoning ambassadors from all over the world			0
the call from a @entity10 leader about the chemical attack , in which he described the move as ' a big mistake ' , was intercepted by @entity13 's @entity71 intelligence service and reported by @entity73 magazine			1
the revelation has led the country 's top spies to agree with the @entity28 intelligence assessment that @entity0 was indeed responsible for using chemical weapons in the attack on august 21			1
@entity81 president @entity80 said that following a ' thorough analysis ' , the regime must have been the perpetrator , and the government is the only actor which possesses chemical agents such as sarin			0
vote : mr @entity31 , pictured with @entity90 's prime minister @entity89 , is facing a debate in @entity92 meeting : mr @entity31 with his national security team at a breakfast summit with @entity90 officials the @entity81 believes that the use of sarin may have been meant as a deterrent against rebel forces , but that the military used too much of it by mistake			1
' the new information from the @entity81 could become important in the coming days , ' @entity73 said			0
' thus far the @entity28 has only noted that after the attack , intelligence agencies had intercepted internal government communications indicating concern about a possible @entity108 inspection of the site			1
' the telephone conversation intercepted by the @entity81 could be an important piece in the puzzle currently being assembled by @entity114 intelligence experts			2
' despite the findings , @entity13 is unlikely to join any military action by the @entity44 after both @entity117 and her main election rival ruled out an attack			1
@entity120 also seems certain to stay away from the front line of any conflict after @entity124 's government was defeated in a vote in the @entity126 last week			1
war : children stand around in the rubble of a building apparently destroyed by @entity0 's forces strike : the @entity44 is expected to launch military attacks on @entity18 within the next few days by contrast , mr @entity31 is expected to win the support of the @entity92 after leading figures from both the @entity138 and @entity139 parties came out in support of intervention			1
speaking in @entity142 as he travelled to the @entity144 summit in @entity145 , mr @entity31 insisted that it was essential to strike against @entity0 over the chemical attacks			2
' in the face of such barbarism the international community can not be silent , ' he said at a press conference			0
' failing to respond to this attack would only increase the risk of more attacks and that possibility that other countries would use these weapons , as well			0
' the president defended his decision to intervene once @entity0 crossed the ' red line ' of using chemical weapons , saying that it was vital to uphold ' international norms '			2
defiant : @entity47 has warned the @entity44 against intervening in @entity18 and igniting a regional conflagration ' that was n't something i made up , ' he said			1
' i did n't pluck it out of thin air			0
there 's a reason for it			0
' the international community 's credibility is on the line			2
@entity28 and @entity92 ' credibility is on the line , because we give lip service to the notion that these international norms are important			1
' he also suggested that @entity47 might be persuaded to change his mind on supporting @entity0 's government			1
' i 'm always hopeful , and i will continue to engage him , ' mr @entity31 said			2
' ultimately , we can end deaths much more rapidly if @entity53 takes a different approach to these problems			2
' speaking alongside @entity90 prime minister @entity89 , he concluded : ' the moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing			0
' summit : world leader will soon be meeting at the @entity193 in @entity145 , pictured banquet : the leaders will dine tomorrow at the @entity196 the @entity29 parliament is today set to debate a possible military response , although the vote is considered much less important than in @entity120 or the @entity28 because of president @entity201 's large majority and relative freedom of action			1
' if you want a political solution you have to move the situation , ' foreign minister @entity204 said this morning			0
' if there 's no sanction , @entity0 will say , " that 's fine , i 'll continue what i 'm doing			2
" ' adding to the tension in the eastern @entity55 , where @entity213 and the @entity28 test - fired a missile yesterday , @entity53 today ordered a missile cruiser to take over its operations in the region			1
the ship , named @entity220 , will be joined by a destroyer from @entity53 's @entity222 and a frigate from the @entity224			2
' @entity226 is heading to the @entity227 , ' a military source told the state news agency			0
' in approximately 10 days it will enter the east @entity55 , where it will take over as the flagship of the naval task force			0
' @entity53 is @entity0 's most powerful global ally , and has consistently opposed @entity114 intervention in @entity18 's long - running civil war , calling instead for negotiations to reach a diplomatic solution			1
attack : a boy who survived the chemical attack on the eastern suburbs of @entity6 two weeks ago mr @entity47 suggested in an interview yesterday that @entity53 would support a @entity108 resolution on military strikes if @entity0 is proven to have carried out the chemical attack			1
however , he insisted that it would have been ' ludicrous ' for the regime to draw the opposition of the international community by using banned substances such as sarin			0
' from our viewpoint , it seems absolutely absurd that the armed forces , which are on the offensive today and in some areas have encircled the so - called rebels and are finishing them off , that in these conditions they would start using forbidden chemical weapons while realising quite well that it could serve as a pretext for applying sanctions against them , ' he said			0
' if there are data that the chemical weapons have been used , and used specifically by the regular army , this evidence should be submitted to the @entity267			0
' and it ought to be convincing			0
it should n't be based on some rumours and information obtained by special services through some kind of eavesdropping , some conversations and things like that			0
' votes : presidents @entity31 and @entity201 have both submitted to lawmakers ' debates on @entity18 the @entity53 president said he was sorry that mr @entity31 had cancelled a one - on - one meeting which was due to precede the @entity144 summit			1
' president @entity31 has n't been elected by the @entity28 people in order to be pleasant to @entity53 , ' he said			1
' and your humble servant has n't been elected by the people of @entity53 to be pleasant to someone either			0
' we work , we argue about some issues			0
sometimes one of us gets vexed			0
but i would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems			0
' one country which is likely to support any @entity114 action is @entity302 , one of the leading regional powers , whose prime minister said today that he would join an international coalition designed at reining in @entity0			2
authorities at the @entity308 , which has been outspoken about attempting to avoid war in @entity18 , have asked all ambassadors in the city - state to attend an audience with the secretary of state tomorrow			2
it is the first time that the whole diplomatic corps has been summoned since 2003 , when @entity316 attempted to prevent the invasion of @entity318			0
@entity308 spokesman @entity319 said the @entity320 would put the @entity322 's position on @entity18 clearly			1
the summons was ' a very infrequent and significant even ' , he added			0
@entity59 has already announced a day of peace for @entity18 on saturday , ' the meanings and purpose ' of which will be explained at the conference of ambassadors , the official @entity325 newspaper the @entity324 explained			2
in an impassioned plea for peace during his angelus prayer on sunday @entity59 said his heart was ' deeply wounded by what is happening in @entity18 and anguished by the dramatic developments which are looming '			0
@entity18 's civil war has been raging for two and a half years , since @entity0 started cracking down on protests inspired by the revolutions in @entity340 and @entity341 , and has killed more than 100,000 people			1
it was revealed this week that more than 2million @entity18 had been forced out of their homeland by the fighting , with the vast majority ending up in @entity16 , @entity302 or @entity346 .			0
