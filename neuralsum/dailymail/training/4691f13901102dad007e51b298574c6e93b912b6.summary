the fetish model from @entity11 claims the steel boned tight - laced corset helped her to overcome shyness @entity3 , who studies fashion , said : ' growing up i just loved the exaggeration of styles and the beautiful costumes that comic book characters would wear and that led to the aesthetic that led to tight - lacing			1
' i like that they wore their personalities externally			0
' i do understand their measurements ca n't ever possibly be achieved because they would break			0
' i think it 's interesting how fabric and thread can just easily manipulate the body to do such an extreme silhouette though			0
' growing up , @entity3 was a tomboy , and says that corset training has helped her to overcome childhood shyness			1
she said : ' as a little girl i was very shy and i loved the way comic books portrayed the characters			0
@entity3 has been waist - training with a corset for seven years			1
her middle now measures an incredible 16 inches she continued : ' i liked that @entity50 is actually @entity50 but when he puts on the batsuit it allows him to become this vigilante			0
' he was the same person but the different outfit allowed him to channel a different side of himself			0
' i 've always loved how certain pieces of garments gave you permission to let out certain parts of you			0
' so i think that 's what tight lacing does for me , i wanted to become my own super hero villain			2
' but waist - training is not without it 's problems and @entity3 does struggle with some physical tasks			1
@entity3 was inspired to start waist - shrinking after becoming obsessed with cartoon characters like @entity14 as a child @entity3 pictured around the age of sixteen with a friend at school in @entity11 was incredibly shy as a child she said : ' the corset can be restrictive when going up the stairs and you ca n't carry too many heavy things because you could hurt yourself			1
' i actually did hiking in my corset and that 's very dangerous			2
' i also played soft ball in a corset once , that was an interesting feeling , but i do n't go to the gym in a corset - that 's really dangerous because i do weight lifting			1
' but if i do want to do something extreme , i do n't limit myself			0
if i have to be out of my corset , then i 'm out of it			2
' @entity3 works as a fetish model , here she is pictured in some of the clothing that she wears on the job @entity3 's corset is unsuitable for any exercise or heavy lifting but despite the limitations , @entity3 has no plans to hang up her corset , despite facing some negative comments online			1
she said : ' i get mixed reactions			0
' some people really love it , some people really hate it , but i always did it for myself - i did n't really do it for people 's reactions			2
' i love modifying and its often mistaken that modification is being a means of not loving yourself but i modify because i can , because it 's fun			0
' people say that it looks unnatural , but i have big bright blue hair - what part of me screams that i want to be like everybody else ? '			2
