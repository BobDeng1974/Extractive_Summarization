by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 2 april 2013 the world 's first solar - powered plane is capable of soaring through the skies without a drop of fuel - even after the sun has set			1
the unique design of the @entity9 - @entity8 - which has a wingspan greater than a @entity11 747 yet weighs less than some family cars - means it can absorb enough energy during daylight hours to continue flying through the night			2
the daring @entity16 inventors behind the aircraft are currently getting ready to fly across @entity18 in the @entity9 in preparation for their long term goal ; a solar - powered flight around the world			1
preparatory technical flights are now underway ahead of the @entity36 mission , due to get underway on may 1			0
the timing of each leg of the journey will be dependent on meteorological conditions , but the aircraft is scheduled to make stopovers in @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 in @entity46 , and @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 , @entity50 , before carrying on to @entity51 and @entity33			0
mr @entity29 and his co-pilot mr @entity31 will be using the stopovers as they make their way west to east to raise awareness of renewable energy			0
the duo hope to complete a round the world flight powered solely by the light of the sun by 2015			2
in order to do so they need to create a solar - powered plane that can continue to operate in cloudy weather			1
despite its considerable achievements , the @entity9 - @entity8 is vulnerable when flying in inclement weather conditions			0
record : the team are hoping to complete a round the world flight in the solar - powered plane , seen in a hangar in @entity73 last week , by 2015 ' pioneering spirit ' : @entity29 , left , and @entity31 , right , standing beside their @entity9 - @entity8 at @entity75 in @entity73 the @entity9 already holds the record for the longest flight by a manned solar - powered plane , after managing to stay in the skies 30,000 ft above @entity16 for more than 26 hours			1
it soars through the sky using four propellor engines powered by some 12,000 solar cells attached to its vast wings			0
solar - powered : the @entity9 - @entity8 is powered by four electric motors and designed to fly day and night by saving surplus energy from its solar cells in high - performance batteries early successes : @entity29 , left , and @entity9 's ceo and pilot @entity31 are seen celebrating after successfully landing the prototype aeroplane in july 2010			2

pilots preparing to attempt flight across @entity18 in solar - powered plane
*details* of planned route across the @entity18 have been *revealed*
hope to fly @entity102 around the world by 2015
plane has bigger wingspan than 747 - but weighs less than some cars
