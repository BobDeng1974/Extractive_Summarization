@entity0 is preparing to launch a range of imacs with @entity3 in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales			2
the firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its @entity10 software called @entity11 , and news @entity12 next month			1
the new @entity12 are set to use a thinner design similar to the @entity15 and include a @entity17 fingerprint sensor			1
the @entity12 is expected to have a 9.7 inch screen , while the new version of the ipad mini will have a 7.9 inch screen , @entity25 earlier reported , citing people familiar with the matter			1
the @entity12 are expected to have a thinner , curved design similar to the new @entity15 6 , and a @entity17 fingerprint sensor			1
@entity0 is also believed to be working on a larger ' @entity34 ' for release next year with a 12.9inch screen			2
' a new line of imacs with ultra high - resolution @entity39 is in late testing stages within @entity0 , according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer , ' said 9to5 @entity10 ' while the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design , which was introduced in 2012 , it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved @entity53 antennas , ' it says			2

the first thing that strikes you about @entity11 is that there is less to look at			0
gones are the bells and whistles , the fake leather and other distractions of previous versions			0
instead , what you have is , without doubt , the best looking operating system ever seen			0
@entity0 's obsession with detail is clear , and when combined with high high resolution retina display of the firm 's latest laptops , the difference is incredibly obvious			1
even the tiny details , such as a new font @entity0 designed , give everything a crisp , uncluttered feel			0
menus also now have a transparent feel , giving the system an almost glass - like feel as you move windows around			0
although @entity92 is not yet available so we were unable to try out the call and ' handoff ' features , the new notification centre on screen gives a real sense that the @entity15 , @entity12 and @entity10 are now one system , system than three separate gadgets			1
the @entity11 software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their @entity10 - even if their @entity15 is in another room			1
notifications can carry over from your @entity15 , and the ' today ' view mimics that @entity15 users are used to			1
also surprisingly useful are the upgrades to @entity111 , the @entity10 's search system			0
searching now shows you information from @entity115 pages , and you can even search the web without having to open a seperate browser window - although it does @entity118 rather than @entity119			0
you can also do basic sums , and even currency conversions form the spotlight window , and even show you cinema times if you search for a film - a real timesaver			0
the mail app has also been updated , with a new ' markup ' feature that lets you easily draw on images - which is great fun to play with			1
surprisingly for what is still a test piece of software , @entity11 also feels incredibly fast and snappy			0
as well as being the best looking os we 've ever seen , @entity11 really does give a glimpse into the future of @entity0 , where all your devices work together seamlessly - as long at they are made by @entity0			0
@entity139 the @entity11 software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their @entity10 - even if their @entity15 is in another room			2
the software has also been overhauled with a new ' flat ' look , and can search the web without having to open a browser			0
the software is the first to be overseen by @entity0 's sir @entity150 , who was recently given responsibility for the design of both hardware and software at @entity0 .			0

retina screens already used in @entity157 , @entity12 and @entity159 laptops
expected to be launched alongside new @entity12 with @entity17 fingerprint sensors
will allow users to easily edit and create @entity165 *hd* video
