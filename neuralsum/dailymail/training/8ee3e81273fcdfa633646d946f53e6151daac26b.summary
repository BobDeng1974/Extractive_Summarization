' at one time i could touch a newspaper as long as i knew i could wash my hands thoroughly afterwards , but now i ca n’t even look at them			1
' she added : ' i do n't like the feel of them - if i touch a newspaper it feels like my skin is crawling , and i ca n’t stand the smell , which i think is quite strong and distinctive			1
' if i see a newspaper flash up on tv , i have to physically turn away			2
' mrs @entity3 , whose children are grown up , suspects the root of her fear lies in uncomfortable memories from her childhood			1
she said : ' when i was a child , my mother hit my father over the head with a newspaper			1
she did it in a playful , friendly way , but it worried me			0
' i became afraid of newspapers gradually over the past 25 years			0
at first i hated it when the newsprint rubbed off on my hands , feeling as if my hands were very dirty , meaning i would have to wash them			2
' today , i just think newspapers feel horrible			0
' mrs @entity3 , who has a sign on her door asking for newspapers not to be delivered through her letterbox , said she winces when she catches her son , @entity73 , 29 and daughters @entity75 , 24 and @entity76 , 19 , enjoying the daily news			1
