after weeks of audition news , @entity0 has beat out a dozen other black comediennes to land a coveted spot on @entity4			1
@entity4 creator @entity5 decided to break tradition and hire a new cast member mid-season after facing criticism that his show lacked diversity for going six straight seasons without a woman of color			1
a spokesman at @entity15 confirmed @entity0 's hire on monday			1
a stand - up comic , @entity0 is also an alumna of @entity19 , the improv comedy troupe founded by former - snl star @entity20			1
she currently acts in the online web series ' @entity22 '			0
@entity0 will make her debut during the january 18 episode , which will be hosted by @entity25			1
@entity0 's competitor @entity37 was one of the many critics of the show 's lack of diversity , going to far as to write a scathing essay on the @entity46 responding to a comment from black cast member @entity48 who said the show often auditions black females but finds they 're never ' ready '			1
@entity37 pointed to the show hosted by @entity53 in november , saying perhaps it was the white male dominated @entity4 writing room that was n't ready to handle black female characters			1
' the @entity4 writers showed what they could do with a " ready " black actress : pigeonhole her			0
they took an @entity62 - nominated actress and made her play a nagging girlfriend ; a sassy eye - rolling assistant ; and a rage - filled @entity66 beauty queen , ' @entity37 wrote			2
' why ca n't they create interesting and funny characters outside race ? how long will it take the snl writers to learn that black is not a punch line ? ' rumors that a new player might be added to the cast started last month , when @entity77 reported that auditions were held earlier at the @entity80 theater for black female comediennes in @entity82			1
the rumor was confirmed by @entity4 's creator and producer @entity5 who told the @entity85 that a black female cast member will join the cast in january - the first time @entity5 can remember adding a cast member mid-season			1
man behind the curtain : @entity5 started auditioning black comediennes last month ' @entity93 told we 've seen about 25 people , ' @entity5 told the @entity85			1
' a lot of people we saw are really good			0
hopefully we 'll come out of the process well			0
' @entity5 also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was initially hiring for the current season this past fall			2
he saw the two women during a performance in @entity103 , but their performances were n't as strong when they were invited to @entity32 for the final auditions			1
' then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized , it looks a different way , ' he said			0
that 's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season			1
@entity5 says he ca n't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of the season , but says he has added players in march or april to get them into the last episodes of the season			1
while many have criticized the show for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady @entity123 , @entity124 or @entity125 , @entity5 says that has nothing to do with his hiring decision			2
' that 's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you do n't judge comedy that way			2
versatility is what we look for			0
' this will be the first time since 2007 that @entity4 has had a woman of @entity142 - @entity141 heritage on the show			2
four black women : in its nearly 40 years on the air , @entity4 has hired just four black women			0
the first was @entity148 , right , and @entity149 , left , spent the 1985 - 86 season on the show no more : after @entity153 , left , left the cast in 1995 , there would n't be another black woman until @entity30 in 2000			1
@entity156 left in 2007 and there has n't been a black woman on the show since the two current black cast members - @entity48 and @entity161 - were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag			1
as a result , there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season , excepting the episode which was hosted by @entity53			2
' snl ' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975 , including @entity30 who is biracial			0
done : cast member @entity48 announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women			2
he had played the likes of @entity182 ( right ) , @entity183 and @entity184 in the past ' it 's not like it 's not a priority for us , ' @entity5 said in an interview with the @entity190 in early november			2
i 'm sure it will happen			0
' news of the invitation - only auditions that have been taking place in @entity82 and @entity103 broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet			1
actress @entity200 said she was ' honored ' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance			0
' it was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but , if you stay ready you ai n't got ta get ready and we were ready ! , ' she told @entity207			2
' i can share that we all entered the @entity80 theater backstage having no idea what to expect			0
i had no clue who was apart of the showcase			0
of course my comedienne friends ( @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 ) were there			0
and some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that i had never met , ' she said			0
it 's happening : @entity4 's creator @entity5 confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this january following reports that a ' secret ' audition were held earlier this month in @entity82 ( those asked to audition pictured ) @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 also auditioned according to @entity236			1
' we were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness , ' ms @entity200 said			0
' we were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot			0
we even held hands prayed after the showcase			0
the show was also sold out			0
it was packed to the max. ' the timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high - profile departure of cast member and head @entity257 , who will leave in the @entity259 to host @entity260 when @entity261 goes to @entity262 .			1

the stand - up comic 's hire was confirmed by a spokesman at @entity15 today
she beat out @entity270 winner @entity35 and sketch - comic @entity37 in the final round of auditions
@entity0 will make her debut on the january 18 episode of the show , which will be hosted by @entity25
the search for a new cast member started early last month with auditions in @entity82 , @entity103 and @entity32
show creator @entity5 does n't usually add cast members mid-season but decided to break tradition after facing criticism over the show 's lack of diversity
