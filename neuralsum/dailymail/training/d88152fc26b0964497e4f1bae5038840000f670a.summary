that might sound fanciful – and even scary – but scientists at a @entity9 firm say they are now just two years away from making it happen			1
the inventors , at @entity14 spin - off company @entity12 , have already created a desktop ‘ disease breathalyser ’ which is proven to work			1
now they are miniaturising their technology further , to create a small add - on device that simply slots into the base of a mobile			1
@entity12 co-founder @entity21 says : ‘ to make a standalone hand - held device , or a module that attaches to a mobile phone , is as little as two years away			1
it ’s just a question of getting the investment			1
’ the firm – set up a decade ago by three engineering graduates – started out making machines to help oil firms detect contamination , and @entity34 anti-terror agencies pick up traces of explosives			1
but 18 months ago @entity37 - born @entity21 decided to take the firm into the medical arena after his girlfriend @entity40 , the mother of their four - year - old twins @entity43 and @entity44 , was diagnosed with colon cancer			2
she was only 34 at the time			2
‘ @entity40 was taken into hospital with stomach pains , ’ @entity21 says			2
‘ that day , she had emergency surgery			2
we then found out she had stage 4 colon cancer			2
’ he read up on statistics for the disease , which hits 40,000 people in @entity9 every year , and was shocked by how much early detection determines survival – and how hard diagnosis can be			1
‘ if it ’s detected at @entity61 , the chances of survival are 90 per cent , ’ says @entity21 , 35			2
‘ at stage 4 , it drops to six per cent			2
’ the couple married a year ago – @entity40 is currently undergoing more chemotherapy – and @entity21 began looking at how @entity67 ’s know - how could identify diseases earlier			1
at the heart of the technology is a fingernail - size microchip that can be programmed to ‘ smell ’ whatever chemical is of interest			0
it can pick up chemicals at incredibly low levels – at parts - per - trillion concentrations			0
this makes it ideal for detecting what @entity21 calls the ‘ telltale chemical fingerprints of disease ’			1
these ‘ markers ’ can be exhaled in breath , or passed in urine or faeces			0
over the past year , @entity67 ’s desktop ‘ @entity91 ’ device – which looks like a chunky @entity89 with a breathalyser tube – has been tested on a number of different markers for disease			1
slightly larger : a standard police breathalyser used to detect alcohol levels researchers at @entity98 used it to discriminate between healthy people , those with the bowel condition colitis , and those with colon cancer			1
rather than breath , they have been checking for certain smelly chemicals in urine vapour			0
the trial has been a success			0
@entity21 adds : ‘ with colon cancer , markers are generated at the very early stages			0
’ that raises the possibility of replacing the @entity116 ‘ faecal occult blood test ’ – which relies on people collecting stool samples and sending them off in the post			0
‘ people do n’t like doing the test and it ’s not very accurate , ’ notes @entity21 , who will be speaking at the @entity121 summit in @entity122 on tuesday			0
the current test throws up too many false alarms , meaning that many people have colonoscopies to check for tumours or polyps , when none exists			0
this procedure , which involves a metal tube being inserted up the anal passage , carries a small risk of serious complications and is also expensive			0
‘ the hope is our technology will give us a screening tool that has better diagnostic accuracy , so fewer people will be sent for unnecessary colonoscopies , ’ says @entity21			1
tests on urine will probably stay in the consulting room			0
but it ’s possible we will be using mobile breathalysers to check for other deadly diseases , such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder			1
@entity12 has just won @entity116 funding to test if its technology can detect lung cancer by ‘ smelling ’ patients ’ breath			0
and last month , @entity34 researchers suggested their own ‘ electronic nose ’ was as good as mammography at detecting breast cancer			0
liver disease and kidney failure are other areas being looked at			1
but do people want their mobiles to detect a killer disease ? should n’t that information always come from a doctor ? @entity21 admits the best place to receive such news may always be the doctor ’s			1
nonetheless , he says : ‘ i think in the future people will want more information about their own health			0
and there are lots of diseases where early detection matters			0
’ @entity21 will be speaking at the @entity121 summit at 30 @entity180 , @entity122 , on tuesday , april 29 .			0

@entity9 inventors ' two years away ' from developing mobile breathalyzer
@entity67 has already created a working desktop ' disease breathalyser '
now they hope to soon have one which had be added to a mobile phone
