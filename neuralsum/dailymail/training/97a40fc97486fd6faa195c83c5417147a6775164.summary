@entity0 was deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs when @entity3 - linked militants stormed a @entity5 diplomatic facility in @entity6 , @entity7 and killed four @entity5 @entity9 officials conspired to prevent an internal @entity10 from seeing damning documents after the 2012 @entity6 terror attack which made then - secretary of state @entity13 look bad , according to a former senior diplomat			1
a picture has emerged of a weekend boiler - room operation in which employees were instructed to sift through boxes of documents and ' pull out ' anything that might make @entity22 or her close associates look bad in the wake of the terrorist murders of four @entity5 including the ambassador to @entity7			1
@entity0 , a former deputy assistant secretary for @entity29 affairs , claims he was scapegoated after the raid by militants acting with @entity32 , an @entity33 terror faction linked with @entity3			1
he told @entity34 , a news outlet operated by the conservative @entity36 , that a room in the basement of the @entity9 was converted to a makeshift document review center on a weekend , supervised by @entity22 confidants			1
' i was not invited to that after - hours endeavor , but i heard about it and decided to check it out on a sunday afternoon , ' @entity0 said			0
inside , says @entity0 , employees – including one who reported to him – were busily covering up information that suggested higher - ups were responsible for the lax security at the @entity5 diplomatic outpost in @entity7			0
days later , @entity32 held two days of open - air rallies and parades including 30 fighting battalions in the city 's main square			0
speakers warned of ' assassinations ' that would come			0
@entity22 – the @entity77 's front - runner in the 2016 presidential sweepstakes – and others at @entity9 have been criticized for denying repeated requests from ambassador @entity81 for more security officers , including some that came after these events			1
. @entity0 was one of four officials officially saddled with responsibility			0
he was later cleared of wrongdoing			0
he was , however , placed on indefinite leave , with pay , while the @entity9 investigated			0
struggling to clear his name , @entity0 met with an agency ombudsman who he says told him , ' you are taking this all too personally , @entity0			0
... it ’s not about you ; it ’s about @entity13 and 2016			2
' @entity99 president @entity98 , whose organization has dented the @entity103 administration 's @entity6 armor with a series of @entity106 lawsuits , told @entity107 that ' @entity0 ’s disclosures are no surprise to those of us who know the @entity113 ' penchant for illicit secrecy			1
' ' the @entity6 cover - up was and is about protecting two presidential campaigns – @entity103 ’s 2012 reelection campaign and @entity13 ’s nascent 2016 campaign , ' @entity98 said			1
' our ambassador and three other @entity5 personnel die in a terrorist attack and the number one concern at @entity124 is protecting @entity13 ! first we have the supposedly missing @entity126 emails and now we may have missing @entity6 documents ? ' in may 2013 the @entity128 interviewed @entity130 president @entity129 , who said disciplinary action meted out to diplomats like @entity0 creates ' a feeling that foreign - service officers often end up as scapegoats when scandals rise to congressional or public attention			1
' @entity0 told @entity34 that the weekend cover - up was held in a basement room at @entity9 headquarters			1
he witnessed senior @entity22 aides overseeing the process of employees poring over boxes and stacks of documents			0
one of the worker - bees was an office director , his subordinate , who was recruited to help without his knowledge			0
' she told me , " @entity153 , we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [ @entity157 ] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light " , ' she allegedly told @entity0			0
@entity32 , the terrorist group that laid waste to the @entity5 diplomatic outpost in @entity6 , held two days of threatening parades and rallies a few months earlier and called for ' assassinations ' -- leading to questions about why security at the compound was lacking ' what difference , at this point , does it make ? ' @entity22 famously snapped in a 2013 @entity172 hearing when confronted with the tall tale that an anti-islam @entity175 video , not a terror plot , sparked the death and destruction in sept. 11 , 2012 @entity0 said that when he asked her to explain herself , she responded that ' those are our orders			2
' the seventh floor of the @entity9 is the showplace level that houses @entity22 's office and those of her closest aides			2
the agency 's official @entity10 tasked with investigating the @entity6 attack never interviewed @entity13			1
a month after the deadly military - style assault , the panel 's leaders demanded to see documents that could help explain what happened			2
top leaders of the of the @entity9 ’s @entity196 were instructed to gather anything and everything that could help			0
those documents , @entity0 told @entity34 , were boxed up and put in the basement room where @entity22 insiders would later screen out the most damaging information before giving the @entity10 the rest			1
he called the investigation ' at best a shoddily executed attempt at damage control , both in @entity207 and on @entity208			0
' @entity9 spokesman @entity209 calls @entity0 's accusations ' totally without merit			2
' but @entity213 @entity212 rep. @entity212 , who will serve on a special congressional committee empaneled to investigation the deadly @entity6 episode , told the news outlet that @entity0 's charges ' are as serious as it gets , and it ’s something we have obviously followed up and pursued			1
' ' i 'm 100 percent confident the @entity222 is going to dive deep on that issue			2

an @entity10 demanded documents related to the 2012 @entity6 terror attack but the most *important* details were kept from them
former deputy assistant secretary says weekend boiler - room *scramble* ' separated ' papers that might *reflect* badly on @entity13
he was scapegoated , he claims , and told by a @entity9 's ombudsman : ' it ’s not about you ; it ’s about @entity13 and 2016 '
@entity103 administration says charges are ' totally without merit ' ; congressman says special @entity6 committee will ' dive deep '
