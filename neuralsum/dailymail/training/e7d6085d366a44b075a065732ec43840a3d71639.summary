@entity0 has denied @entity2 ’s accusation that he had bragged about deliberately crashing into him at sunday ’s @entity4 @entity3 , saying his recollection of their chat was ‘ very different ’			1
while @entity0 made his first reaction to his title rival ’s claims , the @entity9 management were busily applying sticking plaster to their battered team and their conficting stories in an attempt — probably successful — – to avoid punishment for the incident			1
@entity0 and @entity9 were all responding to the most explosive moment of the 2014 formula one world championship			1
it took place over two floors of the @entity9 motorhome — the glistening , portable team hospitality area — in the @entity28 paddock an hour - and - a - half after the race			1
simultaneously , on the first floor , @entity2 was ... briefing the press			2
@entity0 , unsmiling but composed , described their second lap crash as a ‘ racing incident ’ , while @entity2 , careworn and emotional , revealed @entity0 told him in a meeting minutes before that he had deliberately caused the accident which ended the @entity60 driver ’s race			1
@entity0 finished second to extend his championship lead over @entity2 to 29 points			1
responding to @entity2 ’s claims in what he described as one of ‘ the more difficult ’ of his regular video blogs released late on monday afternoon , @entity0 said : ‘ i have been told what @entity2 said in the press and the way he has stated his version of events			1
‘ my view of events is very different			0
but it is better that i do n’t now give all the details of my opinion			0
i hope you respect that			0
i prefer to keep it internal			0
’ booed : @entity0 was jeered when he took to the podium to claim his second - place prize in @entity4 ' gutted ' : @entity2 was left distraught for his team after the contact with his @entity9 teammate @entity0 sombre : @entity0 , pictured , and @entity2 gave press conferences on separate floors after sunday 's race 1 @entity88 ( @entity89 ) 2 @entity0 ( @entity9 ) 3 @entity90 ( @entity91 ) 4 @entity92 ( @entity93 ) 5 @entity94 ( @entity95 ) 1 @entity0 - 220 2 @entity2 - 191 3 @entity88 - 156 4 @entity96 - 121 5 @entity90 - 110 a @entity9 spokesman said their drivers will take part in a sponsor event in @entity101 on wednesday as planned			1
they are expected to see each other briefly			0
but back to @entity28 on sunday night			2
moments after @entity2 made his claim , a @entity9 insider confirmed his recall of @entity0 ’s admission as ‘ broadly correct ’			1
however , in an attempt to defuse the situation before the governing @entity109 might have become involved , @entity9 changed tack			2
their new , refined position was outlined in private briefings and summed up in the on - the - record words of @entity114 , the de facto team principal , who said : ‘ they agreed to disagree in a very heated discussion , but it was n’t deliberately crashing			2
‘ @entity0 felt he needed to hold his line			2
he needed to make a point			0
he thought it was for @entity2 to leave him space and that @entity2 did n’t leave him space			2
ripped : @entity2 limps into the pits with a torn - up rear - left tyre after the incident on sunday in @entity4 change : @entity0 did n't escape damage and had to have his right front - wing endplate replaced in the pits it was deliberately taking into account that if @entity2 moved it could end up in a crash			1
’ as of last night , the @entity109 had not formally asked @entity9 for an explanation			0
if they intervene at all it will be low - key and private , in keeping with the style of @entity109 president @entity136			0
that contrasts sharply with the previous regime of @entity139			0
under his aegis , the @entity109 would doubtless by now have written to @entity9 demanding an explanation of @entity2 ’s claims			1
the @entity109 were heavily involved in 2007 when @entity2 and @entity96 fought for the title , only to lose to @entity92			0
one incident that year was similar to the upstairs - downstairs press conferences in @entity28			1
it came when @entity2 and @entity96 sat in front of the media minutes after the @entity150 had prevented his team - mate from doing a final qualifying lap at the @entity153 @entity3			1
@entity2 was a ball of fury			0
@entity96 ate a pear feverishly			0
that rivalry ended — amid the wider furore of @entity159 — in @entity96 leaving @entity160			0
so how can @entity9 cope with their troublesome twosome ? it appears to be a near helpless situation			0
too much enmity has built up through a season of niggle — arguably because of a lack of firmness from , and respect for , the @entity9 bosses			0
evidently , their drivers ignore instructions			0
@entity114 has said he will think what censure they can impose on their drivers in future			0
but will they really listen ? it seems likely to be a dirty fight of mutual distrust up to the final race in @entity182 , with only self - preservation governing the pair			2
and i suspect that when the season ends , one of them — probably the loser — will seek a new team			0
upset : @entity2 was visibly shaken after a meeting with @entity0 , who is claimed to have admitted guilt april 6 : during the third race of the season in @entity196 , @entity2 cuts across @entity0 , almost causing a crash			1
@entity0 appeals to the team over radio , saying ' tell him that was not on ! '			0
the @entity60 driver holds on to win the race , with @entity0 second			2
may 11 : in @entity204 @entity2 switches engine modes without the team 's permission to hold off @entity0 and win the race			1
may 24 : qualifying for the @entity209 sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint			0
@entity0 crashes while on course for pole , denying @entity2 the chance to set a quicker time			1
@entity2 alleges the crash was deliberate but the @entity218 is cleared of any intent			1
@entity0 wins the race from pole			2
august 24 : the two drivers collide on lap two in @entity4 , with @entity0 later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash			1
@entity224 wins as @entity0 hits @entity2			1

@entity0 denies @entity2 's claim that the @entity218 bragged about their crash which forced the @entity33 to retire from the @entity4 @entity3
@entity0 *wrecked* @entity2 's race after the @entity218 's front right - wing endplate hit the @entity33 's left - rear tyre to cause a *puncture*
@entity2 claimed @entity0 told him he did it on purpose after the race
@entity2 : ‘ i was *gobsmacked* . he ( @entity0 ) *basically* said he did it on purpose . he said he could have avoided it . he said he did it to prove a point '
@entity0 said his recollection of their *post-race* chat was ' very different '
drivers gave press conferences on separate floors of @entity9 motorhome
@entity0 finished second in @entity28 to extend lead over @entity2 to 29 points
a @entity9 spokesman said the pair would be present at sponsor event in @entity101 on wednesday despite the fall - out from the crash
