@entity0 was the biggest @entity2 name in @entity3 for many years and says rugby league star @entity4 has ' zero point one chance of making it but yes he can make it '			1
and if he does , the former @entity9 defensive end believes @entity4 can look forward to a $ us3million annual salary			1
' are the odds against him , yes they are			0
is it going to be difficult , yes , but if anyone can a super athlete like him can , ' @entity0 said			2
opportunity came knocking when he was spotted by @entity3 scouts playing rugby for the @entity2 @entity23 side in 1981 ' he ( @entity4 ) is an inspiration , we should support him because what he 's trying to do takes big balls , ' says @entity0 ' he 's walking into the most intense complex explosive game anywhere in the world at the age of 27 but i just think this country needs more people that decide life starts when you get out of your comfort zone , ' the former @entity3 star added			1
' he 's an inspiration , we should support him because what he 's trying to do takes big balls			0
' can he do it ? yes he can , you got ta believe , you know			0
' @entity2 athletes have transitioned from @entity45 to @entity18 , from soccer and rugby union to @entity3 and even track and field - but never from rugby league to @entity3			1
@entity4 would be blazing a trail not unlike @entity0 , who became the first local rugby union player to make the transition			1
@entity52 now spends much of his time on the public speaking circuit - but still has personal and business interests in @entity18 - he says special teams would suit the former @entity58 player			1
@entity0 was offered a scholarship to play college football and would go onto the @entity3 with the @entity9			2
@entity0 played five years of college football and five years as a professional @entity0 says @entity4 faces two big challenges			1
firstly , dealing with the @entity65 psyche who will see him as potentially taking a position away from one of the locals and secondly , being able to play on synthetic surfaces ' they would have him straight away , like punt return , keep it simple for him , ' he said			1
' and he 'd be great at it and then possibly a fullback position that blocks for the running back or even a running back , but he 's gon na have to be quick because they 're all like him over there			1
' @entity0 has urged @entity4 to find out everything he can and learn from those who have blazed the trail before him			1
his two biggest challenges , he insists , are dealing with the @entity65 psyche who will see him as potentially taking a position away from one of the locals and training on synthetic grass			1
' as an outsider , i had to earn it and fight for acceptance by some who thought i 'd stolen a place meant for an @entity65 , ' he said			2
' that 's always going to be there , at the end of the day if he earns that respect as i did , it 's a long road with that respect			2
' and preparing himself for the different surface of synthetic grass , he should be talking to me number one , i know a lot about both issues and i 'm here to help			2
' he ( @entity4 ) can earn 2 to 3 million a year @entity65 , easily			1

the @entity2 is wearing a number 69 jersey ( third from the right in the second last row ) ' he 's got to get as much knowledge about what he is trying to do and that 's about the athletic application and study of the game , he needs leads for the teams , has he got somewhere to go			0
' this is a superstar of @entity2 sport migrating over to my sport , if i can help i will be happy to			0
i will enjoy watching this			0
' life starts at the end of your comfort zone and being afraid of not having a go and @entity2 needs to get behind him and it 's inspirational for all of us to hear this			0
' he can earn 2 to 3 million a year @entity65 , easily			1
yes it 's zero point 1 chance of happening , the guy 's nearly 27 but i think the guy is the most humble bloke , has a good head on his shoulders and a lot of things going for him			0
