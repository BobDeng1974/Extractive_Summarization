a so - called early version of the @entity1 has gone on public display for the first time in 400 years - as experts revealed they have established a link between it and one of @entity9 's finest country homes			1
a group of historians claim @entity12 painted the work , dubbed the ' early @entity1 ' , more than a decade before his masterpiece portrait and depicted the same @entity17 merchant 's wife			1
it was unearthed before the @entity19 but lay hidden in a @entity21 bank vault for 40 years , while a consortium carried out secret tests before unveiling it in 2012 - though many experts still insist it was one of a litany of inferior copies			1
it was already known that it was bought from a @entity58 aristocrat in 1913 by @entity9 art dealer @entity59 , who kept it in his studio in @entity62 , south west @entity63 , before selling it to @entity66 @entity65 in the 1960s			1
before that , however , the painting 's journey was a murky one			0
now the foundation claims it has identified strong evidence that the @entity58 home where the painting was bought in 1913 could be @entity76 - one of @entity9 's finest elizabethan mansions now run by the @entity78			1
the claim , seen by the @entity81 news agency , would fit if true			2
the @entity83 family which owned @entity85 fell on hard times and secretly sold their possessions just before the @entity19 , leaving the manor in 1911			2
in 1915 the house was taken over by future foreign secretary @entity90 , and it was later put up for sale in 1929			0
by 1931 it was so dilapidated that it was being valued ‘ for scrap ’ at £ 5,882			0
diaries kept by @entity59 - who tried several times unsuccessfully to have the painting authenticated - were lost , but the researchers say the brief references which remain to the house indicate it was @entity85			0
illustrious history : according to the @entity81 news agency , the researchers have linked the painting for the first time to @entity76 , a grand @entity105 in @entity58 now run by the @entity78			1
its owners fell on hard times just before the work emerged in 1913 grand : appropriately enough , the manor - used to film @entity112 - now houses 60 works on loan from the @entity115 now that the house has been restored , it was used as a filming location for the 1995 version of @entity112 starring @entity120 and @entity121 , and its @entity126 houses more than 60 @entity123 and @entity124 portraits on loan from the @entity115 in @entity63			1
the @entity1 researchers also say they have traced the portrait 's history before its possible arrival at @entity85			0
in a communication passed to @entity81 , they said they had found references to a painting called @entity1 - the @entity135 name for the @entity1 - in an art exhibition in @entity137 , @entity58 , in 1856			1
the painting , which was sold to a silver dealer two years later , also featured in a document declaring that young @entity58 noble @entity141 owned a work by @entity12 called @entity1 , which he probably bought on a visit to @entity17 around the 1780s			1
@entity147 - based auctioneer @entity145 , the @entity41 's vice president , said : ' we feel these latest discoveries and new scientific analysis just carried out leave little doubt that it is @entity12 's work			0
' the vast majority of experts now either agree with us or accept that there is a strong case for our thesis '			0
gallery : a visitor compares the two at the world premiere exhibition of the so - called early work , which was unveiled today in @entity49 detail : the ' early work ' ( pictured in @entity49 ) has undergone x-rays and ultraviolet light tests , and been compared to @entity12 's geometry the painting is claimed to show a younger @entity43 , the @entity45 merchant 's wife who is the subject of the slightly smaller @entity1 painting which now hangs in the @entity39 in @entity171			1
the @entity46 says it was probably left unfinished by @entity12 in 1505 , before being completed and handed to @entity1 's husband the following year			1
that would make it more than a decade older than the better - known @entity1 , which was unveiled in 1517 before passing into the hands of the @entity135 royal family and , later , international legend			0
the alleged earlier painting has been subject to x-rays and ultraviolet light scans to establish its age , and has been compared to @entity12 's techniques - including his use of geometry in his famous @entity187 sketch of 1490			0
they say it lacked a specific glazing technique which @entity12 developed in 1508 , and which was used in most of his paintings after that date			0
it has earned the seal of approval , at least partially , from modern experts including @entity198 historian @entity197 , art historian @entity199 , research physicist professor @entity200 and professor @entity201 , one of the most influential living experts on @entity12			1
reputation : the @entity1 ( right in 2005 ) was painted by @entity17 master @entity12 ( left ) and is now the world 's most famous portrait tourist attraction : visitors strain their eyes to see the real @entity1 - which has been stolen and defaced in the past - through @entity39 security not everyone is convinced the painting is a real work by the @entity17 master			2
there were several contemporary copies of the @entity1 , and historians have often suggested the so - called early version is just another one			2
and although the @entity21 - based @entity41 is described as being not for profit , its entire aim is to study the painting - which is now owned by an anonymous ' consortium ' , so it is difficult to establish who would benefit financially if it was declared a genuine @entity12			2
one of the leading doubters of the painting 's authenticity in 2012 was @entity232 art history professor @entity231 , who was instrumental in identifying a major work by @entity12 in 2010			2
although he had not personally seen the painting - also known as the @entity235 after @entity59 's studio - he said two years ago : ' the @entity235 mistranslates subtle details of the original , including the sitter 's veil , her hair , the translucent layer of her dress , the structure of the hands			2
' the landscape is devoid of atmospheric subtlety			0
the head , like all other copies , does not capture the profound elusiveness of the original			0
' he also said the @entity62 version was painted on canvas , and @entity12 's preferred choice was wood .			0

' early @entity1 ' on display for first time since 2012 unveiling after it lay hidden in @entity21 bank vault for 40 years
several experts claim it is a true @entity12 , and today linked it for first time to @entity76 in @entity58
they say @entity124 manor is where art dealer @entity59 bought it before @entity19 as owners ran out of money
