by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 11:51 est , 19 march 2012 children whose mothers use crystal meth during pregnancy will be more prone to anxiety , depression and moodiness in later life , scientists have revealed			1
so - called ' meth babies ' are also more likely to weigh much less when they are born and suffer from drowsiness and stress in their formative years			1
researcher @entity13 said the combination meant they were at higher risk of developing serious behavioural problems than other children			1
study : children whose mothers use crystal meth during pregnancy will be more prone to anxiety and depression but while there was certain similarities to ' crack babies ' , whose mothers consumed crack cocaine while pregnant , ' meth babies ' could be in greater danger			1
this was because , she said , meth has a strong effect on the brain and is therefore more likely to have longer - lasting effects in children			1
the first study to look at methamphetamine 's potential effects was conducted by @entity40 's @entity39 and published online today in @entity41			0
government data suggests more than 10million @entity43 have used meth , with around one per cent of users being pregnant women			1
poison : @entity47 is the street name for methamphetamine , the most hyper - charged member of amphetamine family which is usually smoked through a pipe weight : the average size of babies whose mothers use crystal meth ( left ) and those who do not ( right ) this means there are 100,000 pregnant women snorting , swallowing or injecting the highly addictive euphoria - inducing drug across the @entity43 @entity61 , head of the @entity63 's behavioural division , said the research was ' groundbreaking '			1
street name for methamphetamine - hyper - charged member of amphetamine family @entity68 , white crystalline powder - but some forms have strong ammonia smell , because of solvents used to make it increases arousal in nervous system : pumps up levels of norepinephrine and dopamine at low doses boosts alertness and blocks hunger and fatigue ; higher doses causes exhilaration and euphoria ; very high doses cause agitation and paranoia physically increases heart rate , blood pressure and body temperature anxiety , emotional swings , and paranoia are common psychological effects of chronic use overdose is a huge risk : symptoms include fever , convulsions , and coma death can result from burst blood vessels in the brain ( triggered by spikes in blood pressure ) or heart failure @entity109 tends to last 4 - 12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days , eat very little and in heightened state of arousal but because the study is a first , the results should be viewed cautiously and need to be repeated , he said			2
a total of 330 children , from aged three to five , were tracked in the @entity119 and @entity120 , areas where meth use is most common			2
mothers were recruited shortly after giving birth in @entity125 , @entity126 ; @entity127 , @entity128 , and @entity129 , @entity130			0
they were asked about prenatal meth use and newborns ' stools were tested for evidence of the drug			0
effects in children exposed to the drug were compared with those whose mothers did not use meth			2
both groups were high - risk children , with many living in disadvantaged homes			2
mothers or other caregivers completed a widely used checklist asking how often children showed many kinds of troublesome behaviour			0
at three - years - old cores for anxiety , depression and moodiness were slightly higher in meth - users ' children			1
these differences persisted at age five			0
the older children who had been exposed to meth also had more aggression and attention problems similar to @entity163 , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder			1
mothers were asked about symptoms , but not if their children had ever been diagnosed with behaviour disorders			0
more than half of the mothers who had used meth during pregnancy also used it afterwards			0
these women also were more likely to use other drugs during and after pregnancy and to be single mothers			0
but the researchers said accounting for those differences and others in the two groups ' family lives did not change the results			0
research : this table compares characteristics in mothers and children who have been exposed to meth ( left ) and not exposed ( right )			0

100,000 women in @entity43 are consuming crystal meth during pregnancy
their children are more likely to suffer from drowsiness and stress
at much higher risk of developing serious behavioural problems
