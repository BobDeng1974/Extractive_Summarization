a celebrity doctor known as ‘ @entity1 ’ has played a key role in getting @entity3 to the start line for sunday ’s @entity5			1
‘ i was close to pulling out , ’ she admitted			1
‘ there was definitely a point i was worried because i thought , “ @entity8 , if i ca n’t run for 45 minutes , i ca n’t get round a marathon ”			1
’ instead @entity3 turned to renowned @entity11 doctor @entity10 , who has worked with the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
world record holder @entity3 said she ' was close to pulling out ' of the @entity5 on sunday but @entity10 , who has worked with @entity13 , has made sure @entity3 will race despite a very public split with @entity19 coach @entity18 last week , @entity10 joined an @entity21 foot surgeon , orthotics specialists in @entity23 and physiotherapists at @entity25 to make sure @entity3 will reach the start line for her final competitive marathon on sunday			1
the 750,000 who are expected to pack the 26.2 - mile course from @entity32 ’s @entity31 to @entity33 will not witness a @entity3 of 2003 vintage			1
her world record time of 2:15:25 still stands 12 years later but the 41 - year - old will be nowhere near that mark this time , setting off with the good club runners rather than the elite women			2
finishing the race will be a victory of sorts for her after fearing a degenerative injury to her foot would rule her out			2
‘ i was in @entity50 and training was going well , ’ she said			0
' but because the trails are pretty rocky out there i tweaked my achilles			0
i went down to @entity56 ( her training camp in @entity59 ) and it snowed there so i did a couple of runs on the treadmill			0
maybe because it was harder on the treadmill my achilles started to get really sore			0
’ sunday 's @entity5 will be @entity3 's final competitive marathon of her career celebrity doctor @entity10 ( left ) , known as ‘ @entity69 ’ , recently @entity11 giants @entity19 the turning point came four weeks ago while on a run in the park near her home in @entity75 with daughter @entity76 , eight			1
‘ she was on her bike and it ’s quite hilly so i was more impressed that she kept up			0
' from that day , i ’ve been able to gradually increase it and get back , with ice buckets after every run , and i ’m just really grateful to everyone who has helped me			0
‘ if i was being competitive i would have pulled out five weeks ago			2
but i ’ve just been there so many times and this time i just thought it does n’t matter if i run it in three hours or 2:45			0
‘ i ’m almost there and i ’m hoping my body will remember a little bit once i get running			0
