top gear star @entity0 has revealed how @entity2 allegedly told @entity4 officials to stop the crew entering the country as they tried to flee from an angry mob upset over their car ’s @entity9 number plate			1
the 54 - year - old @entity12 presenter claims the @entity14 country tried to stop their quick getaway so that @entity0 – along with the show ’s fellow stars @entity17 and @entity20 – could be arrested			1
however , @entity2 ’s plan was thwarted when the @entity4 officials refused to succumb to the request – instead letting the crew into the country where they were able to safely fly back to the @entity26			1
they claimed it was a reference to the the 1982 @entity41 conflict @entity0 said the number plate was a coincidence and was not meant as a reference to the @entity45 a @entity47 car which was used by @entity29 presenter @entity20 is pictured with smashed windows after being pelted with stones by angry @entity45 veterans as the crew tried to make their way through the country the drama unfolded when the @entity29 convoy was attacked with rocks , sticks and pickaxe handles as it made its way through the country during filming for a special edition of the @entity12 motoring show			1
angry locals hounded the crew after the @entity65 was driving arrived into the country with the @entity68 plates – which locals have claimed referred to the 1982 @entity41 conflict			1
@entity0 said he was forced to hide under a hotel room bed with his co-stars as an armed mob rampaged after them and shouted : ‘ this is a mafia state , best you do as you 're told '			1
they were eventually forced to flee @entity2 under police escort – three days earlier than planned - as the furious thugs tried to ' kill ' them			1
they faced a gruelling six - hour journey to the @entity4 border in a collection of hired 4x4s , trucks and the three ' star ' cars that the crew had planned to use in the ‘ car football match ’ for the show			1
they eventually made it to a remote border post where there was not even a road , but a river , and boarded a tractor to cross the water into the neighbouring country			2
the presenters ' cars were left by the side of the road in @entity2 before they fled across the border to @entity4 @entity0 's damaged @entity65 bearing the @entity68 plate , which locals took to be reference to the 1982 conflict the @entity29 crew came under attack from a group of angry @entity45 veterans the crowd was incensed by the number plate - h982 @entity68 - on the @entity65 driven by @entity0 the attack took place in @entity113 , on the southern tip of @entity2			1
the crew later fled over the border to @entity4 however , the presenter said it was at this point on friday night that they faced difficulty crossing into @entity4 when the @entity2 ordered that they were stopped			1
he told @entity122 : ‘ after they [ the crew ] crossed a river into @entity4 , they spoke to the local official who said his opposite number in @entity2 called him and told him to chuck our guys out , back into @entity2			1
‘ their plan was to then arrest the crew for entering the country illegally			2
‘ luckily for us , we ’re really popular in @entity4 and they love the @entity26 so the official refused			1
in fact his direct quote was , “ i told them , f * * * k you ! ”			0
’ @entity0 described him as a ‘ real hero ’ and also praised the police officers who escorted the film crew safely into @entity4			1
@entity0 ( pictured after landing at @entity145 ) said the number was a complete coincidence @entity0 took to @entity148 upon returning to the @entity26 to clarify that no offence was intended to be caused however , he also accused the @entity2 of taking advantage of their visit for ' political capital ' and said the violent protest was ' state - organised '			1
‘ the more i think about this , the more i ’m convinced we were set up by the local government , ’ he added			0
the controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the @entity12 received it for filming , a spokesman for the show said			1
the h at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991			2
@entity68 , the last three letters , represent where the vehicle was first registered			2
in this case it was @entity170 in @entity171			0
the numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the @entity174			0
@entity65 confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at @entity29 , but from a private owner			2
it is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £ 80			0
plates beginning in @entity182 or q - @entity183 registered vehicles - can not be transferred			0
motorists can not transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger			2
his comments come as it emerged that he may have broken driving laws by switching number plates on the grey 1991 @entity65			0
photographs show how the crew swapped the number plate from the controversial @entity68 to @entity197 after the abuse started			1
however , the replacement plate is allegedly already licensed to another vehicle – a white 206 @entity65			0
it means @entity0 could have breached driving regulations as the @entity174 said it is an offence to drive a car ‘ in this country or abroad ’ under a plate other than the one assigned to the vehicle			1
the @entity208 reported that the @entity12 planned to ask the @entity29 crew about the registration plate used but ‘ not in an investigative way ’			1
earlier , @entity0 took to @entity148 to confirm that he , along with the rest of the @entity29 team , had not meant to cause offence with @entity68 plate			1
he wrote : ' the number plate was a coincidence when it was pointed out to us , we changed it			1
' and these war veterans we upset			0
mostly they were in their 20s			0

someone could have been killed			0
' this was not a jolly jape that went awry			0
for once , we did nothing wrong			0
' we had planned a good ending for the show			0
but thanks to the government 's foolishness , it 's now even better			0
