what @entity1 did in @entity3 and @entity4 managed here will do much for the culture @entity0 is trying to create as new @entity8 coach			1
they will inspire their team - mates with their discipline , character and application , just as @entity14 inspired me with the way he batted to save a @entity17 in @entity18 and in his famous battle with @entity20 at @entity21			1
this is an era in which @entity8 are losing players to the easier option of the @entity25 and it is understandable because of the money that can be made there			1
why should n’t they cash in ? @entity4 ( right ) celebrates reaching his century for @entity8 in second test but @entity4 has taken the difficult road			1
it is all well and good going off and having a bit of a hit and giggle but he will take a lot more satisfaction from the way he has taken on the moving ball in a demanding test match			2
these are the types of innings you remember when you retire			0
he will remember his duel with @entity45 , the way he saw off a newish ball and how he took the attack to @entity49 on the first evening			1
he did finally fall to @entity50 after a loose shot but by that time @entity4 had grafted his way to 103			1
that is what you get in test cricket			2
this is far harder than going off towards the end of your career and enjoying an @entity25 sunset			0
i never played in an easy test			2
there is no easy option during five hard - fought days and that ’s why this game gives you far more satisfaction than you will ever get over 50 or 20 overs			2
it gets me down to hear people saying ‘ was n’t @entity3 boring ’ or ‘ these pitches are just too dead and the cricket is slow ’			0
the @entity49 won in the dark of @entity76 was remembered for years because it was the ultimate conclusion to three hard tests			1
the same could happen here			0
i can see a lot of our @entity49 side of 2000 in this @entity8 team			1
we could not become a winning side straight away			0
@entity8 batsman @entity84 grafted his way to 103 against @entity49 in the second test we had to stay in games , instil a bit of pride and discipline before we could think about being positive and that ’s what @entity0 is trying to do here			1
the first step is to take @entity17 into five days and once that is achieved then @entity8 can think about moving on and hopefully keeping their best players			1
the seven days we have had so far in this series may not have satisfied those who prefer their gratification instant but i have enjoyed it			0
this is not to denigrate @entity102 or what we saw at the @entity104 but there is something fulfilling about seeing a match go to the fifth day as in @entity3 , with @entity49 bowling 130 overs and trying to find different ways to take 10 wickets			1
we live in a modern world of instant news where test cricket seems something of a throwback but there is still great satisfaction to be taken from a slow burner			2
@entity45 was admonished by umpire @entity120 following clash with @entity4 i find the mental side of test cricket to be unparalleled			1
to be @entity124 , for instance , getting a duck in his first innings after waiting to get back in for 18 months			0
then he has to spend the best part of two days fielding and sweating on a pair			0
you ca n’t replicate that in any other form of the game			0
someone like @entity135 has to tackle a technical issue , having been found out by opponents , and has the mental battle to overcome it			0
there is the physical challenge of a bowling attack spending all that time in the heat trying to bowl a side out and then having to go through it all again			0
in @entity102 you can have a bit of a slog , edge through the slips for four to get you off and running and then get caught on the boundary which is supposed to happen in the short game			0
i thoroughly enjoy the different attractions of limited - overs cricket			2
but test cricket is what players will be remembered for			2
even in the modern world .			0

@entity4 will inspire team - mates with discipline and application
