the family of @entity8 enjoy the views of the @entity10 in @entity11 , while protecting themselves from the local grizzly bears			1
the den is so high up the mother had to have a quick break as she climbed the cottonwood tree before she was reunited with her cubs			1
@entity18 for heights : these bears have taken a leaf out of a bird 's book and have made themselves a nest 65 feet up a tree and the cubs could hardly contain their excitement as their mother approached them after climbing to the nest in the tall tree			1
and the photographer , @entity30 , who lives just 30 minutes from the park , was delighted when he captured this unique moment			1
the 52 - year - old said : ' when their mother finally came back to the den - the cubs were really excited - they wanted her milk			1
taking a break : the cubs climbed up the tree quicker than their mother who stopped and looked around pause : the den is so high up , the mother had to have a quick break as she climbed the cottonwood tree before she was reunited with her cubs ' i was very lucky to have captured this moment because it was my first trip to the den and i was delighted that they were out that day			2
' there are a lot of grizzly bears that live nearby , but the high den protects them from an attack and the photographer was pleased that they came out			2
he added : ' they made the den because it protects them from other bears			2
' there are a lot of grizzly bears nearby , but they can not climbs trees so the den is very safe for this family of bears			0
' i only saw the mum leave the den. the two cubs wanted to follow her but the tree trunk was too thick for them - they could n't get down from their nest			0
' the cottonwood tree is perfect for their den because it is really tall and hollow so they can easily transform it into a nest			0
' mother bear : the cubs could hardly contain their excitement as their mother approached them after climbing to the nest in the tall tree view from above : the mother bear with her cubs in the den high up in the tree at the moment , the den is the perfect size for the family of three , but if they get any bigger it could be a bit of a squeeze			0
mr @entity30 , who spent five days taking the photos , continued : ' the den can accommodate the mother and her two cubs			0
' if the cubs were more than a year old three bears would be too tight			0
' the mum and cubs were very cute - it was a heart warming scene - it made me realise that @entity8 are very good climbers			0
