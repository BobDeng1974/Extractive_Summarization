by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 02:28 est , 17 december 2012 famed for their grumpy , solitary lifestyles , socialising has never been known as a priority for rhinos			1
but new footage shot in @entity7 has revealed how the black variety of the animal enjoy regular night - time liaisons involving kisses , cuddles and a level of social interaction previously unknown in the species			1
thanks to the latest high definition night vision cameras , scientists are now able to observe the animals in the dark for the first time , and have observed a boisterous personality trait that rarely appears during the daytime			1
affection : two black rhinos were caught on camera greeting and sharing an intimate moment in the darkness of the desert partying ? : the gatherings revealed a level of social interaction previously unseen in black rhinos , who are normally grumpy in the daytime in footage captured for sir @entity40 ’s latest @entity39 wildlife series , @entity7 , 50 animals were revealed to be gathering in groups of up to 16 each night			1
@entity42 , who was the scientific adviser for the film crew , told the @entity44 : ' for us to see this happening at night is extraordinary			2
it seems to be happening every night and we could see different individuals coming and going each night			2
' this has n’t really been documented or seen before			0
we thought the extent of their social interaction was individual males wandering around and searching out females to mate with			0
' ready for action : a black rhino arrives early at a secret watering hole , to join a midnight gathering of sometimes 15 or so other rhinos the documentary revealed romance was not dead to the breed , with the animals coming together to rub noses , play together and communicate using a range of sounds including high pitched squeaks for calves , and loud bellows by the older adults			1
in a sophisticated attempt to win the attention of a female , a young male picked up a pair of antelope horns with his own horns and gave them to her			0
but the solicitation ends badly when the female snubs his advances by pretending to go to sleep			0
mr @entity42 added : ' what is so touching is that there is a whole side to them that we were not aware of and had not been able to record before			0
' previously the crews could only use the light of the moon to observe the rhinos at night , but the cover of darkness meant the goings - on of their social engagements stayed secret			1
there are two types of @entity100 rhinoceros – black and white , the latter being more common and more sociable during the day			1
the shot had to be delayed for a year while a camera that could work with almost no light was being developed			2
it enabled the crew to observe that the eyes of the rhinos were wide open			2
the exact location of filming will not be revealed due to the threat of poachers			0
on tape : a black rhino at a secret location in the @entity116 , where new technology was used to observe the creatures at night the sequence is part of a landmark new series profiling @entity7 as never before caught on film			2
other scenes show eagles catching giant bats on the wing , lizards stalking their prey on the backs of lions , antelope - hunting monkeys and a nail - biting giraffe fight			0
breath - taking : the documentary shows fog lingering over the mountainous dunes , supplying the desert with precious moisture left : featured on the programme was an aerial view of @entity141 desert dunes - showing the vaporous fog which provides just enough moisture to allow life to exist			0
right : desert giraffes living in the dry ephemeral river valleys of the @entity141 , where water is a scant resource aggressive : the programme also featured two @entity100 lions competing for dominance remote : only found in the @entity152 , @entity153 , these blind catfish are some of the rarest on the planet captured : a shoebill stork chick was filmed in the nest for the first time			1
the birds proved very difficult to find and crews researched them for six months journeying : a family of elephants cross the parched plains of @entity165 in the shadow of @entity167 swarming : eight million straw - coloured fruit bats fill the sky above a tiny patch of forest in @entity172 , @entity173			0

scientists *excited* to catch black rhinos in midnight gatherings in @entity100 watering hole
the animals have never before been seen socialising in groups
new high definition cameras which function with nearly no light made the discovery possible
