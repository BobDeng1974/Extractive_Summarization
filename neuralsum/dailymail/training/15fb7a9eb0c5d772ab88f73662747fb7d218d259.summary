after the anxiety of the first day @entity0 settled comfortably into the @entity2 with a cramp - free , drama - free passage into the third round			1
under the glare the @entity8 lights and in a gusting wind the former @entity6 champion made light of a useful challenge from @entity15 qualifier @entity13 to win 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in one hour and 46 minutes			1
it was a satisfactory evening all round for @entity0 as his first scheduled seeded opponent , powerful @entity19 lefthander @entity18 , was knocked out 6 - 3 in the fifth set by @entity22 @entity21 , the world number 96			1
he and @entity0 have not played each other before			2
@entity0 later bounced back , though , in his mixed doubles opener as he and @entity49 fought back to beat @entity50 and @entity51 3 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 13 - 11			1
bouncing back : @entity39 got over his men 's doubles exit with victory in the mixed doubles the same could not be said of the @entity55 and @entity13 , who go back to the days of @entity57 junior tournaments , since when one has scaled the heights and the other carved out a journeyman ’s living			2
@entity13 is a decent enough player to give @entity0 a good workout and very decent for a world number 235 but lacked a weapon with which to hurt him			1
@entity0 was too solid in the strong breeze on a cool evening in @entity67 , and despite the wind his serve was considerably improved from what it was against @entity71 , and there were no signs of the physical problems that sent him into spasm against the @entity76			1
' the start was tough in the conditions and we both struggled early on but we had some fun points in the second and third sets , ' said @entity0			0
' it ’s always special playing on this court , i ’ve loved it since i first came her at 15			0
i struggled in my first match but i pulled up okay tonight			0
' @entity21 is a very flat hitter and a big hitter and he ’s dangerous , it will be a tough match			0
' @entity0 has had some big nights on @entity91 but in truth this was not one of them , with much attention centred elsewhere on packed @entity97 17 , where 15 year - old @entity99 @entity98 was playing			2
ab fab : @entity0 was back to his best beating @entity13 to reach the third round of the @entity2 support : @entity0 's girlfriend @entity104 watches from the stands as her man books his place in the next round approval : coach @entity110 applauds as her charge @entity0 puts in an impressive performance tumble : @entity15 's @entity13 falls to the ground as he is knocked out of the @entity2 the 2012 champion began with an ace , in contrast the double fault with which he kicked off on monday , and from thereon put in a controlled performance with no angst - filled outbursts in any direction			1
his movement , always a barometer of his game ’s overall health , was excellent			0
@entity13 held his own until the eighth game when two break points were created			0
the first was saved by a 131mph ace but on the second he hit a forehand long			0
@entity0 sealed the set after 27 minutes with a 128mph ace of his own			2
the @entity55 was cranking up his returns and that aggression brought an immediate break at the start of the second with the @entity139 , who was playing with no pressure and after winning four matches here , losing five games on the trot			0
a pleasing aspect of the @entity0 game was his ability to lob his onrushing opponent , and he went two sets up by clinching a second break at 5 - 3			1
the former @entity6 champion briefly got into trouble at 2 - 2 in the third , when he saved three break points from 0 - 40 down			0
the @entity15 then saved six of his own in the eighth game , often with precision serving , but @entity0 made no mistake the next time and broke to love to seal his passage through			1
an evening devoid of much incident was doubtless exactly what he wanted			0
