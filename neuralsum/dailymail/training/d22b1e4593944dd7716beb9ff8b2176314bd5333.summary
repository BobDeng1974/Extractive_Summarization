labour leader @entity0 today warned than 1million voters have disappeared ahead of the election			2
he blamed the government for making changes to the voter registration system which means hundreds of thousands of young people have lost their ' sacred democratic rights '			1
but @entity9 's general election handbook , sent to candidates across the country , tells them not to bother with families where no - one has ever voted and instead focus on people who might want mr @entity0 in @entity15			1
labour leader @entity0 blamed the government for making changes to the voter registration system which means hundreds of thousands of young people have lost their ' sacred democratic rights ' @entity9 has calculated that almost one million people have dropped off the electoral register in the last year as a result of what the party says was the ' hasty ' way the government introduced individual voter registration - intended to reduce electoral fraud - without proper safeguards			1
it says that many of the missing voters are young people - in part due to the decision to end the block registration by universities and colleges of students living in halls of residence			2
university cities and towns such as @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 have all seen five - figure falls in the numbers of registered voters , according to @entity9 , while in @entity55 the numbers are down by almost 100,000			0
@entity9 's @entity56 advises candidates on which houses to target when knocking on doors mr @entity0 promises to lead a ' national mission ' to ensure young voters were able to hold the coalition leaders to account on may 7			1
in a highly - critical speech , mr @entity0 said : ' this government has betrayed young people			1
having broken their promises on tuition fees to young people , having failed to build the economy that will work for them , having short - changed their future , this is @entity74 and @entity76 's final insult to young people			1
' they are sitting by and watching hundreds of thousands of young people in our country lose their sacred democratic rights			1
we will not allow this scandal to happen and no right - thinking person should either			0
' but the handbook sent to labour candidates warns against ' watsing too much volunteer time ' on people unlikely to vote			2
it states : ' the only people you should not be prioritising are those who live in a household where : â€¦ no - one has ever voted , no - one has a postal vote , no - one has turned 18 since 2010 and no - one has moved in since 2010			0
' activists are also told to steer clear of homes when people plan to vote @entity100 or have ' formally asked us never to contact them again '			2
@entity9 's attack on the electoral roll numbers has also been rubbished by the @entity104			1
an @entity104 spokesman said : ' it has always been known that some areas with large student populations would initially see a fall in the number of students on their register and that extra effort would be needed to ensure as many as possible are on the register before the april 20 deadline			0
' electoral registration officers all have detailed plans in place to target areas with high student populations			0
this work will continue right up until the registration deadline			0
' the guidance recommends that activists do not prioritise households where no - one has ever voted @entity126 mp @entity125 said that many of the ' missing ' student voters would still be on the electoral roll but would have previously been registered twice			0
' @entity9 must have forgotten they began the policy of individual electoral registration while they were in government and still support it in principle , ' he said			0
' instead of scaremongering , @entity9 should be working with their own local authorities to ensure that the large amount of money available is spent helping people , particularly students , register to vote			1
' @entity139 , deputy chief executive of the @entity140 , said : ' it 's good to hear @entity0 join the chorus of voices warning about the number of people in danger of falling off the electoral register			2
while it was sensible to move on from the victorian - era system of household registration , there have been real concerns about making the switch so close to an election			0
' it 's now the duty of everyone concerned , including central government , local authorities , the voluntary sector and all the political parties , to find those missing millions and make sure they do n't lose out on their most basic civic right			0

@entity0 to warn thousands of young people will miss out on voting
blames changes which mean individuals must register to vote themselves
*claims* hundreds of thousands have lost their ' sacred democratic rights '
but @entity9 's election handbook tells activists to ignore *non-voters*
