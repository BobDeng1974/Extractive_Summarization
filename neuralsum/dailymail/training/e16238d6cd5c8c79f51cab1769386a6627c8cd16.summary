for years , pilots flying into combat have jammed enemy radar to confuse or sneak up on their opponents - and it turns out moths do this too			1
hawkmoths in @entity7 have been found to emit sonic pulses , generated by rubbing their genitals on their abdomens , in response to the high - frequency sounds created by bats			1
bats use this echolocation to pinpoint , with great precision , the location of its prey , but the pulses are thought to ‘ jam ’ these signals to confuse and disorientate the mammals			1
these pulses are designed to respond to high - frequency sounds created by bats ( right )			1
bats use echolocation to pinpoint , with precision , the location of prey , but the pulses are thought to ‘ jam ’ these signals to confuse the mammals ‘ bats and moths have been engaged in aerial warfare for nearly 65 million years , ’ explained assistant professor @entity36 from @entity37			1
‘ this arms race has produced a suite of counter-adaptations in moths , including bat - detecting ears			1
‘ one set of defensive strategies involves the active production of sound ; ultrasonic replies to bat attack have been shown to startle bats , warn the predators of bad taste and jam their biosonar			1
’ pilots typically use radar jamming and deception during warfare			0
aircraft emits radio frequency signals designed to interfere with nearby radar equipment			2
in the case of electronic jamming , the pilots block the receiver with electrical energy signals			0
mechanical jamming devices , instead , reflect radar energy back to the radar			0
this tricks the rival pilot into thinking the target is somewhere else on its scope			0
it is thought the hawkmoths sonic pulses act in a similar way to mechanical jamming on the bat 's ability to pinpoint their prey			1
in the @entity86 footage , the bat is shown attempting to grab the moth , before missing			2
professor @entity36 , alongside co-author @entity88 from the @entity89 , have been studying this behaviour in @entity91			0
by tethering a hawkmoth to a wire , and releasing a bat into a controlled environment , the team were able to track the movements and sounds of both using cameras and high - definition microphones			1
it was previously known that tiger moths exhibit a similar defensive strategy - using tymbals , a vibrating membrane located on the thorax - but this genital technique was the first time it was observed in hawkmoths			2
slow - motion videos revealed that males make the noise by grating modified scraper scales on the outside of the ‘ claspers ’ against the abdomen			2
these claspers , or genital valves , are typically used to grab females during mating			0
however , it is thought that females also produce ultrasound in response to an echolocation attack			2
they appear to pull part of their genitalia towards their bodies , so the genital scales also rub against their abdomens			0
the study is published in @entity132 , a journal of the @entity134 , and footage of the moths and bats in action features on sir @entity140 ’s upcoming @entity139			1

while females appear to pull part of their genitalia towards their bodies , so the genital scales also rub against their abdomens			0
a recording of the signal is pictured top ‘ this is just the first step toward understanding a really interesting system , ’ professor @entity88 said			0
‘ @entity155 has been focused on porpoises , whales and dolphins			0
we know some insects produce the sounds , but this discovery in an unrelated animal making ultrasound , potentially to jam the echolocation of bats , is exciting			1
’ hawkmoths are among the fastest and most proficient flying insects , and more than 1,400 species can be found worldwide			0
their long proboscis , or mouthpart , makes them important pollinators and many plants may only be pollinated by hawkmoths			0
this recording shows the hawkmoth responding to playback of a bat echolocation attack			0
hawkmoths are among the fastest and most proficient flying insects , and more than 1,400 species can be found worldwide ‘ we think hawkmoths are a primary food source for bats because none appear to be chemically defended , which is why they have evolved anti-bat ultrasound strategies , ’ professor @entity88 continued			1
‘ @entity178 have evolved different ways of avoiding bats - i ca n’t even explain how amazing the system is , it is just fascinating			2
’ @entity189 of the @entity191 series details the evolution of flight and also reveals how flies perform acrobatics in mid-air , how dragonflies use four wings , and how hummingbirds are able to fly sideways			0
the series starts 7pm , @entity201 , @entity202 and in @entity203 on @entity204			0
‘ the story of evolutionary flight is one i ’ve always wanted to tell in @entity209 , ’ said sir @entity140			1
‘ it ’s a wonderful subject and a very exciting project but technically it is a huge challenge , especially in @entity209			0
’ @entity189 of the @entity86 series details the evolution of flight and also reveals how flies perform acrobatics in mid-air , how dragonflies use four wings , and how hummingbirds fly sideways			1

hawkmoths create sonic pulses by rubbing genitals on their abdomens
these pulses respond to the high - frequency sounds created by bats
bats use echolocation to pinpoint , with great precision , the location of prey
but the pulses are thought to ‘ jam ’ these signals and confuse the mammals
footage of the moths features in sir @entity140 ’s @entity86 series
