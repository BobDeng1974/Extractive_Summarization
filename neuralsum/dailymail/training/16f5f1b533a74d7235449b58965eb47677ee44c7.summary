we feel so stupid : how could my wife and i have been conned out of more than £ 7,000 by one phone conversation ? the answer is that the scam was brilliant in design and execution			1
it began with a phone call after dinner on a friday night			1
my wife answered the phone and the caller announced herself as ‘ dci @entity14 of the @entity16 ’			1
the inspector was polite and matter of fact			1
she asked my wife if she had been in the @entity20 on @entity21 that day or the one in @entity22 ? my wife replied that she had n’t			2
deception : the fraudster pretended to be @entity15 and used a clever technical trick and ' brilliant ' acting skills to con her victims but @entity28 reported that someone had bought expensive items from these stores using my wife ’s debit card — and the transactions had been within four minutes of each other			1
anyone who knows central @entity38 knows it is almost impossible to get from @entity21 to @entity22 in such a short time — something was definitely amiss			2
the inspector then broke the news that someone had cloned my wife ’s card and was using it to make major purchases			1
panicked by this information , my wife called me over to the phone and asked me to speak to @entity28			1
the inspector explained that the @entity16 had been monitoring @entity20 , conscious that the launch of the latest @entity53 would make it a target for criminals			1
‘ do you have all your cards with you ? ’ she asked			1
‘ are you sure ? ’ yes			2
in the background i could hear hubbub that made me think of tv ’s @entity64 or prime suspect : the faint sound of people chatting , the sense that @entity28 was at one desk and other detectives were hard at work on the case , too			2
having established that neither my wife nor i had been to the @entity20 , she asked if i had noticed any strange transactions on my cards			1
trick : the con - artist instructed the couple to phone but stayed on the line so the call went straight back through to her ‘ but we ’re worried , ’ said the inspector			1
‘ we think all your cards have been compromised			1
it may be that someone has hacked into the @entity87			2
we need to block all the cards now			1
’ inwardly , i shivered			2
does this mean identity theft ? ‘ yes , it could be			2
you ’ll need to take part in a police investigation later			2
but we need to block your cards first			1
’ immediately , i was suspicious			2
why would she want all our cards ? was @entity95 who she said she was ? how could we know she was really working for the @entity16 ? her answer turned us from cautious sceptics into credulous fools			1
‘ call 999 and check me out , ’ she urged			1
i put the phone down , picked it up again and dialled 999			1
the dialling tone was normal , the phone rang and the response was as prompt and efficient as a law - abiding citizen could wish for			1
which service did i want ? the police			2
i ’ll put you through			0
when a constable picked up the phone , i asked : ‘ do you have a @entity15 @entity14 of the @entity111 ? ’ ‘ yes , i ’ll connect you			1
’ @entity28 picked up the phone — her identity verified			1
in fishing parlance , we were hooked — and were about to be sunk			0
‘ we can have your cards blocked immediately , ’ said @entity95 to reassure us			1
‘ new cards can be delivered to your house in three working days , or five for the foreign cards			1
but first we ’ll need your pin numbers			0
’ that should , of course , have rung alarm bells			0
how many times have we all been told , ‘ never , never give your pin number to anyone			1
your bank will never ask for it ’ ? we hesitated — and this is where @entity95 scored again			1
‘ do n’t tell me the codes , ’ she said			0
‘ tap them into the phone and they will be sent straight to our technical team			1
’ and so , stupidly , but trusting that the digital wizardry was in our interest , we did			0
and , as we later discovered , using specialist technology , she recorded the numbers			1
con : the scam depended on the couple believing the woman when she said their cards had been cloned by this time , we had been on the phone for at least an hour , in a state of shock and growing despair over the hassles that apparently came with @entity153 theft			1
@entity95 kept reassuring us that all would be well			1
‘ are you ok ? do you have enough money for the weekend ? we can get you emergency funds of £ 300 delivered to you by 3pm tomorrow			0
we ’ll debit it from your @entity160 account and i ’ll call you again tomorrow at noon			2
’ it was all so comforting			0
her manner was solicitous , reassuring and practical			0
when i asked my wife to pour me a glass of wine , @entity28 heard me on the other end of the phone			2
she laughed and said she could do with one , too — but not on duty			0
stressful call : the couple were completely taken in and their shock and despair grew as the conversation went on and when she said she would send a courier round to pick up our compromised cards , it seemed so reasonable			1
‘ put them in a sealed envelope inside another envelope , and do n’t tell the driver what it ’s for			0
we ’ll contact him ourselves			0
’ almost as if we had been hypnotised , we did as we were told			2
‘ the driver ’s on his way			0
he ’ll be with you shortly			0
’ he was and , within minutes , as we later discovered , our accounts were being plundered , mostly , it seems , by withdrawals from atm machines at @entity195			0
meanwhile , @entity95 kept me on the line , supposedly keeping us abreast of the activities of the criminals who had cloned our cards			1
‘ there ’s been a withdrawal in @entity38			0
we ’re watching the @entity204			0
’ on and on it went , as my wife and i became increasingly tired and desperate , but @entity95 kept us hanging on , saying : ‘ do n’t put the phone down			1
’ i realise now , of course , that this was to stop us ringing the banks of our own accord			0
at around midnight , my wife collapsed into bed , but @entity95 kept me on the phone until 1.30am			1
i had been speaking to her for two - and - a - half hours			0
to say we slept badly is an understatement			0
we tossed and turned , fretting about the money being siphoned out of our accounts			0
breakfast and the cold light of day brought me to my senses			0
‘ perhaps , i should call 999 again , just to check , ’ i thought			2
' hypnotised ' : the couple did everything ' @entity226 ' asked of them after they were taken in by the con the operator who answered was annoyed			1
she told me my case was not an emergency and i should dial 101 for my local police service			2
with mounting anxiety , i explained that i had dialled 999 the night before and that my call had been put through to an officer			2
‘ we have no record of a call , ’ she said			2
‘ ah , hang on a moment			0
i ’ll talk to a colleague			0
’ and then , with the help of bona fide officers , the truth about the scam was revealed			0
it all hinged on a clever technical trick			1
quite simply , if you put the phone down , but the other party does not , they stay on the line			2
even if you dial a new number , you remain connected to the original caller			0
so when i dialled 999 , it went back to ‘ dci @entity14 ’			0
she must have had an accomplice posing as the emergency services operator and , as easy as that , we fell into their trap			0
hi - tech : specialist technology allowed the fraudster to record the pin numbers as they were entered into the phone the @entity268 , responsible for card security , says there has been a three-fold increase this year in incidents of this scam			1
in the first quarter of 2012 , an estimated £ 750,000 was lost			0
in total , we lost around £ 7,000 of our savings			0
the police — the real police — have been sympathetic and tell us that the con is targeted at the well - to - do and the elderly who may not be as techno - savvy as younger account holders			2
mercifully , most of the money has since been credited back to us			0
the banks conceded we were victims of an understandable gullibility			0
initially , only @entity288 bank @entity287 failed to reimburse us , but eventually ( after an anguished protest on my part ) , it , too , paid up			0
naturally , my wife and i feel embarrassed and a little sheepish at having been fooled so easily			0
in our defence , i can only say that the woman who played ‘ dci @entity14 ’ was a brilliant actress and this particular bit of financial con - artistry was new to us			1
we are lucky the damage done was n’t permanent and that most of the money has been returned			0
others may not be so lucky			0
i may feel shame - faced about having been so easily deceived , but let my gullibility be a very modern cautionary tale to others .			0

the con began with phone call from woman claiming to be an inspector
' @entity95 ' told the couple someone was using cards to buy items
she said the card had been cloned and was being used to make purchases
@entity318 rested on clever technical trick , specialist technology and acting skills
