by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:04 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:49 est , 13 december 2013 children of the 80s will remember the classic , and sometimes infuriating , childhood game of @entity7			0
it involved moving a pinball over an obstacle course of steps , swings and slides and remains popular today			0
but now a group of @entity16 enthusiasts have created an amazing modern - day version complete with escalators , robotic hands and even a pneumatic ramp			1
each section is made from an individual ' module ' with various motorised arms , scoops , lifts , escalators , robotic hands and corkscrews that transport the balls from one module to another each module should have an ‘ in ’ basket , and should move balls to the next module 's ‘ in ’ basket			1
this basket should be at least 10 studs wide , by 10 studs long and high , with an 8x8 opening			0
the ‘ in ’ basket should be built onto the left - hand side of a module , and the output should go to the right			2
each module should be able to accept balls at an average rate of 1 per second and balls can be passed one at a time , or in a batch of fewer than 30 balls			2
called the @entity58 , the mechanical device is said to contain around 11,000 bricks and is made up of modules submitted by various members of a @entity25 @entity16 fan club			1
one of the largest stretches was built by 22 - year - old @entity64 from @entity65			2
he built 17 of the modules using around 3,000 bricks			1
it took him almost 600 hours to build , and his modules include a ball factory followed by a zigzag stair and lift			1
a pneumatic ramp scoops the balls into a cup and the balls are then thrown towards a miniature basketball hoop			1
the action is so precise that the majority of the balls go through the hoop			0
a mechanical train then picks these balls up and moves them to a spiral lift before a mechanical plastic fork scoops the balls from the lift puts them onto a moving step			1
a belt conveyor then moves the balls to the next module			1
other members who contributed to the construction include @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 also contributed modules			2
a mechanical train then picks the balls up and moves them to a spiral lift , pictured , before a mechanical plastic fork scoops the balls from the lift and puts them onto a moving step			2
a belt conveyor then moves the ball to the next module the modern - day @entity113 works in a similar way to the 1980s @entity117 game @entity7 , pictured @entity64 has been building with @entity16 since he was a child and said during a @entity119 - a documentary series that interviews @entity16 fans on @entity122 : ‘ since i was little i ’ve always like watching @entity16 that move			1
i like the movements that look like robots			0
’ a great ball contraption or ( @entity22 ) is a machine which moves small balls from one module and passes them to another module			2
it is based on the @entity131 , which is a contraption that performs a simple task in a complex way , usually involving a chain reaction of events to take place in order to perform this task			0
@entity16 enthusiasts around the world make @entity22 and there are even rules			0
for example , each module should have an ‘ in ’ basket , and should move balls to the next module 's ‘ in ’ basket			1
this basket should be at least 10 studs wide , by 10 studs long and high , with an 8x8 opening			0
other members that contributed modules to the construction include @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 one of the largest stretches was built by 22 - year - old @entity64 from @entity65			1
he built 17 of the modules and used around 3,000 bricks			1
this section shows the balls being flung through a mini basketball hoop using pneumatic arms the ‘ in ’ basket should be built onto the left - hand side of a module , and the output should go to the right			1
each module should be able to accept balls at an average rate of one per second and balls can be passed one at a time , or in a batch of fewer than 30 balls			0
@entity64 continued : ‘ when you start building @entity22 it ’s very hard to come up with your own original creation			0
i think you should start by copying other people ’s modules			0
that way you can learn faster			0
you should n’t think about it too much , you should just start moving your hands and building			0
you will make mistakes but eventually you ’ll get it to work			0

the machine was built by members of the @entity24 in @entity25
@entity191 spent 600 hours building his 17 modules
a total of around 11,000 bricks were thought to have been used
pneumatic arms , robotic scoops and conveyor belts move the balls around
