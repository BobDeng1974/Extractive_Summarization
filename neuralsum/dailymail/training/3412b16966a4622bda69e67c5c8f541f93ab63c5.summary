by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 12:08 est , 26 july 2013 scientists looking at charged particles in space have discovered particle hurricanes surrounding @entity5			1
these highly - charged particles are part of something known as the @entity10 belts , which are two concentric rings encircling the @entity5 and held in place by a magnetic field			1
since the @entity10 belts were first discovered in 1958 , astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration			1
the acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belts			0
since the @entity10 radiation belts , pictured in this artist 's impression , were discovered in 1958 , astronomers have been trying to identify how the high - speed particles make their way into the belts			1
two @entity31 probes have now proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds the @entity10 radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around @entity5			1
they are kept in place by the planet 's magnetic field			0
the belts range from an altitude of 1,000 up to 60,000 kilometres above the @entity5 's surface			2
the radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are			0
the belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist @entity10 from the @entity53 while aboard the first @entity55 space mission			1
one theory suggested the particles were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside			0
the second suggested that particles were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within			0
@entity31 sent probes up to track the behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds			1
data from @entity31 's twin space probes suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local acceleration , similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of warm ocean water on @entity5			1
this theory explains why the belts change shape - because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions			0
space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the high - energy radiation belts that circle @entity86 and @entity87 , as well as around @entity89 - like stars			1
the belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist @entity10 from the @entity53 while aboard the first @entity55 space mission			1
researchers believe that the electrons contained within the rings of radiation had travelled from the @entity5 's magnetosphere - an area of space around the planet in which charged particles are kept in place by the planet 's magnetic field			2
they thought that as the particles drifted closer to @entity5 and the magnetic fields became stronger , they would travel faster and settle into a ring - shaped orbit			2
however , this type of acceleration process would take weeks and only applies to belts that change and grow gradually			0
in the 1990s , satellites discovered that the energy and shape of the @entity10 belts was changing much faster than first thought			2
this led to a second theory which suggested that charged particles do n't come from the magnetosphere , but instead are caused when electric fields within the belts tear electrons from nearby atoms and accelerate them in the process of tearing them from their source			2
in 2012 , @entity31 launched two @entity127 , pictured , that could simultaneously study the belts from different angles			0
following a solar storm which blew most of the belt 's electrons away , the two probes recorded a 1,000 times more electrons developed over a 12 - hour period			0
scientists believe that this proves that the electrons must develop from within the belt in august 2012 , @entity31 launched two @entity127 that could simultaneously study the belts from different angles			2
following a solar storm which blew most of the belt 's electrons away , the two probes recorded a jump of 1,000 times more electrons over a 12 - hour period			0
scientists believe that this proves the electrons must develop from within the belt , and are not collected over time			0
@entity148 from the @entity149 in @entity150 - authored the study			0
he told nature journal : ' we have in this one event been able to really distinguish between the different ways that particles can be accelerated			0
the radiation belts were the first discovery of the space age and it â€™s just really exciting with the @entity10 probes to have seen right to the heart of the process			1
' physicist @entity164 of the @entity165 in @entity166 added : ' if [ local acceleration of energetic particles ] occurs in the heart of the @entity5 's @entity10 belts , it also probably does so in the more intense radiation belts around @entity87 and @entity86 and even in planets around magnetized stars beyond the @entity175			1

the @entity10 radiation belts were discovered around @entity5 in 1958
@entity31 sent probes up to explore how the particles inside the belts behave
*latest* research proves that the belts create their own particles and do n't just trap particles that travel nearby
