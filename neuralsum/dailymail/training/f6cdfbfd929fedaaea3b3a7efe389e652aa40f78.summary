despite his current role as the head of a terror organisation that has brought rape and massacre to vast swathes of the @entity17 , @entity10 's tutors describe him as a ' well behaved ' student			1
the certificate - which addresses @entity10 by his real name @entity24 - goes on to detail his talent for mathematics and love of geography at @entity29 for boys , the latter of which perhaps helps to explain the brutal expansionist policies of his self - declared caliphate			1
despite his progress in certain subjects , @entity34 failed his final year in 1990 at the age of 18 or 19 and was forced to resit his exams - almost certainly alongside younger students			1

he performed far better in some subjects than others , however , soaring ahead with a 98 per cent average score in maths , 90 per cent in geography - but only 57 per cent in @entity8 , meaning he only scraped a pass grade by just seven per cent			1
interestingly for somebody who now speaks in an elaborate and difficult to master classical @entity79 whenever delivering his radical sermons , @entity2 was a fairly average @entity79 student at school , scoring an 81 per cent pass grade			1
the @entity29 for @entity54 certificate calls @entity34 by his real name @entity24 , although it does not use his tribal suffix @entity58			1

friends of @entity34 have previously told of how he was a talented footballer , with one former team - mate even describing him as the ' @entity144 of our team '			2
he was also remembered as a shy and unassuming young man who was interested in religious studies , before his radicalisation to a dangerous extremist			0
since rising to power within the @entity3 , @entity34 's brutal thugs have shocked the world with their sadistic and savage murder of thousands of people in @entity5 , @entity156 and @entity157			2
the terror group - believed to have more than 30,000 soldiers - have revelled in posting graphic images and videos of murders including beheadings and burning victims alive			2
