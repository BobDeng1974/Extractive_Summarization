by @entity0 published : 15:50 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 17:04 est , 14 january 2014 a rogue detective has been jailed after he illegally searched his own force 's database and tipped off a convicted drug dealer about raids and arrests			1
@entity8 , 31 , passed crucial intelligence to 33 - year - old @entity10 from @entity12 computers for more than seven years			1
police today declared that ' no police officer is above the law ' after @entity8 was jailed for 28 months			1
@entity17 cop : former detective @entity8 ( left ) has been jailed after he leaked vital information about raids and arrests by @entity22 police to @entity10 ( right ) , a convicted drug dealer @entity23 heard the detective , from @entity25 , @entity22 , joined the force more than 10 years ago and first leaked data to @entity10 in april 2005 while he was on trial for supplying drugs			1
he was repeatedly ' tasked ' by @entity10 to make the illegal searches and pass information on the drug dealer and his criminal associates			1
the illegal checks continued up until @entity8 was discovered in march last year when police raided the home of a crime suspect			1
there they seized a mobile phone containing a text message which , via another phone , was traced to a mobile used by @entity8			0
the text message was about police raids and was so accurate , it could only have been provided from confidential police systems			0
searches : @entity8 used the it systems of @entity12 , pictured , and was discovered through a text messages on a criminal 's phone ( file photo : none of those pictured were accused of wrongdoing ) anti-corruption officers were able to prove the message originated from a phone attributable to @entity8 and was sent when he was on duty and using a police computer work station			1
at first the former detective admitted his checks were not for legitimate police business - but claimed they were ' out of curiosity ' , or to check whether what @entity10 was telling him was accurate			2
at the start of their friendship @entity8 said the checks were conducted to ensure he was not associating with a criminal and he claimed not to have sent any confidential or sensitive information , or anything @entity10 would not already have known			1
@entity8 was investigated by his own force @entity12 , whose @entity79 headquarters are pictured but @entity8 later admitted conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office in court			2
he was sacked by @entity12 for gross misconduct on august 29 last year and was jailed in october			2
his case could not be reported until now because @entity10 was facing a drugs trial			0
@entity10 , from @entity87 , @entity79 , denied conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office but was found guilty and jailed for 28 months			1
for the drug dealing offences , he was handed an extra 10 years ' jail			0
superintendent @entity93 from @entity12 ’s @entity94 said : ' police officers take a vow to serve the public and uphold the law with fairness , integrity and impartiality			1
any that fall short of those standards , or who abuse their position , will face disciplinary action , the prospect of criminal prosecution and potential dismissal			0
' no police officer is above the law			0
@entity8 was a rogue officer who believed he could discretely pass information to a friend in the criminal fraternity - but we have a dedicated team of anti-corruption officers whose job is to uncover any misconduct			2
' as soon as @entity8 was suspected of acting improperly an investigation was launched that resulted in his arrest and suspension from duty			0
he was subsequently sacked by the chief constable at an internal hearing , following his guilty plea in court , and has now been jailed			0
' his police career is over and he faces the prospect of having his police pension seized ; he ’s rightly paid a very high price for these breaches of trust and position			0
' police said an application to seize all or part of @entity8 ' police pension is under way , with the final decision on how much to confiscate being taken by the home secretary			0
' no officer is above the law ' : the headquarters of @entity12 in @entity79			2
