cardinal @entity11 said sorry as it was revealed that he must resign now rather than wait until his 75th birthday , which falls next month			2
in a statement the @entity17 , 74 , said : ‘ looking back over my years of ministry : for any good i have been able to do , i thank @entity14			2
for any failures , i apologise to all whom i have offended			0
’ the @entity21 instruction follows allegations made by three un-named priests and one former priest who say that they were subjected to ‘ inappropriate ’ approaches by the cardinal 30 years ago			1
the complaints were made to the @entity21 ’s representative in @entity28 early last month – before pope @entity29 announced his resignation , but after @entity31 had made known to @entity32 that he wished to resign ‘ in view of his 75th birthday ’			1
the sudden departure of the cardinal leaves the church grappling with the implications of a new sex scandal affecting its senior leadership and denies @entity6 @entity5 any influence on the voting when 116 cardinals gather to elect @entity29 ’s replacement next month			1
the affair intensified the sense of intrigue and conspiracy that has grown around the @entity49 since @entity29 made the surprise announcement of his own decision to quit on february 11			2
the dramatic move to become the first @entity8 in 600 years to resign has provoked intense speculation both on what influences may have been at work on @entity29 and on what role he will play after he stands down			2
a @entity21 adviser in @entity59 said the @entity11 resignation was ‘ shocking and sad ’ but ‘ unsurprising ’			0
cardinal @entity11 ’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks			0
the vehemence of his public stand against same - sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby			0
his immediate departure was set out in an announcement from the @entity59 church yesterday morning			0
cardinal @entity11 said : ‘ approaching the age of 75 and at times in indifferent health , i tendered my resignation as @entity86 and @entity4 to pope @entity29 some months ago			1
’ he added that he had been ‘ happy to know ’ that on november 13 last year the @entity8 had accepted his resignation , but that it would take effect at an unspecified later date			0
position : the archbishop was the head of the @entity5 in @entity59 and the @entity6 's senior priest senior church figures are expected to go at 75 , but the @entity21 often allows leeway of a year or two			1
following news of the sex scandal over the weekend , the @entity8 gave @entity31 no choice			0
‘ the holy father has now decided that my resignation will take effect today , 25 february 2013 , and that he will appoint an @entity103 to govern the @entity104 in my place until my successor is appointed , ’ @entity31 said			2
the decision means he will no longer travel to @entity32 as planned to take part in the conclave that will elect the next @entity8 in march			1
the @entity17 said in his statement : ‘ i thank pope @entity29 for his kindness and courtesy to me and … i wish him a long and happy retirement			1
‘ i also ask @entity14 ’s blessing on my brother @entity115 who will soon gather in @entity32 to elect his successor			1
i will not join them for this conclave			0
i do not wish media attention in @entity32 to be focused on me – but rather on pope @entity29 and on his successor			1
’ saying mass in @entity4 : cardinal @entity124 in his role as @entity6 's most senior @entity5 @entity31 , who on sunday missed a mass in @entity127 in @entity4 that had been intended to celebrate eight years of @entity29 ’s papacy , has contested claims of inappropriate behaviour made against him			1
the claims were made to the @entity132 , the @entity21 ambassador in @entity28 , @entity132 , in the week before the announcement of @entity29 ’s resignation on february 11			1
according to the @entity137 newspaper , one former priest claims @entity31 made an inappropriate approach to him in 1980 , after night prayers , when he was a seminarian at @entity141 , @entity141			1
the man , who is now married , says he resigned as a priest when @entity31 was first made a bishop			0
he said in his complaint : ‘ i knew then he would always have power over me			0
it was assumed i left the priesthood to get married			0
i left to preserve my integrity			0
’ in @entity32 : the cardinal had been due to travel to the @entity21 to take part in the forthcoming papal conclave a second statement from another priest says he was living in a parish when he was visited by @entity31 , and inappropriate contact took place between them			1
a third man said he had had to deal with ‘ unwanted behaviour ’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after some late - night drinking			1
the fourth complaint came from a priest who said the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact			1
retiring : pope @entity29 delivers his blessing during his last @entity171 noon prayer from a window overlooking @entity173 at the @entity21 yesterday a @entity21 adviser in @entity59 , professor @entity175 of @entity176 , said : ‘ the resignation of @entity31 as @entity178 and @entity4 , within a month of the date on which his formal resignation would normally have taken effect is both shocking and sad			1
‘ given the nature of the accusations , however , and the publication of them over the weekend , ahead of the formal abdication of @entity29 later in the week , it is unsurprising that he has taken the decision to resign			2
’ professor @entity175 , added : ‘ @entity17 could not but be mindful of the problems that would follow given the inevitable press interest created by the accusations , and he would not want that burden to fall upon the @entity5 and the @entity8 at what is obviously a critical moment in the life of the @entity5 community			0
' the departure of the @entity17 leaves the five million faithful in @entity6 without a representative when the new @entity8 is chosen			0
it will mean that the number of cardinals with the power to vote in the conclave for @entity29 ’s successor is reduced to 116 , with at least one other withdrawal a possibility between now and the opening of discussions in the @entity21 next month			1
there are some 750,000 catholics in @entity59 who would have been represented by the @entity17 as @entity178 and @entity4			2
more than four million @entity5 in @entity212 and @entity213 have no voice in the talks and no vote in the final reckoning because there is no qualified cardinal among their leaders			0
cardinal @entity221 , who stepped down as @entity223 in 2009 , is 80 , and so too old to join the voting bloc of cardinals			0
he will , however , travel to @entity32 to take part in advisory talks			1
his successor as archbishop of @entity230 , the most reverend @entity229 , has yet to be awarded a cardinal ’s hat more than three years after taking over as leader of @entity5 in @entity212 and @entity213			2
some observers believe this is because @entity29 has been suspicious of what he sees as liberal tendencies among @entity212 bishops			2
another cardinal is under pressure to follow @entity11 out of the conclave			0
@entity242 , former archbishop of @entity243 , who is being urged to step down by lobby groups who accuse him of covering up sex abuse by priests			2
the conclave may now begin around march 10			0
the @entity8 ’s resignation takes effect on thursday evening this week , 28 february			0
