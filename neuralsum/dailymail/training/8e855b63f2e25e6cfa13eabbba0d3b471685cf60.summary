an @entity1 fan spent 40 hours and £ 700 getting a huge tattoo of the show inked across his body , only for @entity5 to be misspelt			1
police officer @entity6 , 29 , from @entity7 , south east @entity8 , had the black and white design featuring the cast of the @entity12 comedy show etched onto his right ribcage over the course of two years			1
the tattoo also depicts the show 's famed logo , and signs for @entity1 , where the characters live , and @entity5 - which takes its name from the slang for stolen or knock - off goods			2
only @entity1 fan @entity6 , 29 , spent 40 hours and £ 700 getting a huge tattoo of the show inked across his ribcage , only for @entity5 to be misspelt ( ringed ) on the tattoo , the street , which features heavily in the closing credits , is misspelled ' @entity31 ' - although mr @entity6 is adamant its spelling is open to interpretation			1
' i did lots of research and other people have tattoos of " @entity31 " , as well as " @entity5 " or " @entity39 " , so i do n’t think it ’s wrong , ' he said			0
the official lyrics of the chorus of the closing theme to the long - running sitcom cite the dodgy market lane as ‘ @entity5			0
’ as well as the spelling error , mr @entity6 has to contend with the fact his girlfriend @entity48 , who is mother of his two children , hates the show because she does not think it is very funny			1
mr @entity6 has to contend with the fact his girlfriend @entity48 ( left ) , who is mother of his two children , hates the show because she does not think it is very funny ' i started getting it done two years ago - it ’s my favourite show - every episode is a classic , ' said mr @entity6			1
' @entity48 hates it though , and she thinks it ’s rubbish			0
' but i ’m covered in tattoos so she ’s got to get used to it , i suppose ' mr @entity6 's @entity6 ’s huge inking is meant to portray the show 's central characters , but some unsympathetic observers have suggested that many of the images are so distorted they look like different people			1
according to one person who saw a picture of the tattoo online , @entity70 looks like greasy car salesman @entity74 from the @entity76 sketch comedy , whereas @entity77 looks like the actor who plays @entity79 , @entity78			0
mr @entity6 , who is leaving the @entity80 after ten years to become a taxi driver , added : ' i do n’t care what people think of it , i love it and that ’s the main thing			2
' the last bit i had done was the writing			0
' it was painful but worth the effort			0
' mr @entity6 loves the tattoo , which features characters from his favourite programme			2

@entity6 , 29 , had the design etched on his side over course of two years
but @entity5 has been spelled @entity31 on the tattoo
police officer mr @entity6 *insists* the spelling is open to interpretation
his girlfriend @entity48 is not a fan of the @entity12 comedy show
he says she has ' got to get used to ' his new tattoo
