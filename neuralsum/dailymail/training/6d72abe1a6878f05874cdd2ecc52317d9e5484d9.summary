by mail online reporter the @entity1 has blocked the donation of a teen suicide victim 's eyes because he was gay , it has emerged			1
@entity9 ' @entity8 ' , @entity5 , 16 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , committed suicide in july 2013 after enduring more than 18 months of ridicule when he was outed as gay			1
before his death he had registered as an organ donor			0
after his passing , a 14 - year - old boy was able to receive his heart , but his eyes have been rejected from donation because of the @entity1 rule saying men who 've had sex with men in the last five years should be ' ineligible ' for donating certain tissues because of the ' risk factor ' of their behavior			1
the @entity1 's policy is a leftover from when the @entity49 crisis was at its peak , and is part of an overall ban on blood from homosexual men			1
as the @entity56 reports , blood donation is held to even stricter standards , saying men who ' at any time since 1977 ( the beginning of the @entity49 epidemic in the @entity61 ) are currently deferred as blood donors			0
' this is because ' a history of male - to - male sex is associated with an increased risk for exposure to and transmission of certain infectious diseases , including @entity70			0
' the @entity1 insists such a hardline stance is required , as there is a ' documented increased risk ' of infections like @entity70 been transmitted and that are heightened when ' associated with male - to - male sex and is not based on any judgment concerning the donor ’s sexual orientation			1
' @entity5 's mother @entity40 has called the policy preventing her son 's eye donation ' archaic ' but critics call the policy archaic			2
' we think it ’s time for the @entity1 to take a serious look at this policy , because it ’s out of step with peer countries , it ’s out of step with modern medicine , it ’s out of step with public opinion , and we feel it may be legally problematic , ' ; @entity94 , a bioethics law professor for @entity95 told @entity96			2
@entity94 argued the ban was contradictory as it only banned men who had sex with hiv - positive women or prostitutes for a single year			0
and last summer , the @entity102 voted to end the ban			0
but the regulations on tissue donation are more nebulous than the blood bans			2
a homosexual man 's vital organs - such as the heart , liver , and lungs - can be donated as long as the recipient knows their origins and signs a waiver			1
however , the @entity1 classifies eyes as human tissue , which is banned from use if the donor was a sexually active gay man			1
@entity5 's liver , lungs , kidneys , and heart have all been successfully donated because in those cases as long as the recipient gave consent with knowledge of the risks and counseling , organs are allowed to be donated however @entity5 's eyes were rejected because @entity40 could not confirm whether he was sexually in the years before his death			1
@entity5 's friends said he had struggled with bullying for years before he was outed as gay , having been teased over a cleft lip and for being half @entity136			2
' he 's different , ' best friend @entity137 told reporters after @entity5 's death			0
' he does n't add up to what they 're used to			0
' @entity40 says she 's appalled by the regulations			0
' it is just silly that people would n’t get the life - saving assistance they need because of regulations that are 30 years old , ' @entity40 said .			0

@entity9 ' @entity148 , 16 , killed himself in 2013 after being *mercilessly* bullied for being gay
@entity5 *requested* his organs be donated
his heart , liver , and lungs have all found homes , but @entity1 regulations on donating tissue from gay men are *prohibiting* his eyes from being donated
@entity1 classifies eyes as ' tissue ' which can only be used if the donor was not sexually active
