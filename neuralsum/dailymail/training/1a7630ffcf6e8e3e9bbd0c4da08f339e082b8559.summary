mr @entity21 told @entity28 radio : ' we will not give in			2
the spirit of ' @entity31 ' means the right to blaspheme			0
' we will not give in otherwise all this wo n't have meant anything			0
a @entity36 banner means you have the right to criticise my religion , because it 's not serious			0
' we have never criticised a jew because he 's a @entity41 , a @entity19 because he 's a @entity19 or a @entity42 because he 's a @entity42			2
' but you can say anything you like , the worst horrors – and we do – about @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity19 , because behind the nice slogans , that 's the reality of @entity1			1
' @entity49 and @entity50 chose the publication as the target of their attack last week after it repeatedly published cartoons of @entity3 , which some @entity56 find deeply offensive			1
the magazine once renamed itself ' @entity59 ' , claimed to be guest edited by the @entity3 and carried the cover slogan ' 100 lashes if you do n't die laughing '			1
their offices were burned down after a petrol bomb attack in 2010 , believed to be connected to the images , though on that occasion nobody was hurt			0

on the day after the attacks staff first confirmed there would be a magazine this week , saying it would take submissions from cartoonists around the world			2
the issue will be translated into 16 different languages , though the remaining illustrators have admitted it has not been easy pulling the publication together			1
@entity98 , a @entity31 cartoonist , said : ' we 're getting by			0
we are having less nightmares			0
we are trying to put a magazine together and find some calm and inspiration , it 's not easy			0
' we are down to a skeleton staff since last wednesday as you might have noticed but we 'll try our best			2
' for freedom : since the attacks on @entity1 's offices last week millions of people have come forward to support the magazine 's right to blaspheme , coining the slogan @entity107 en masse : more than a million people took to the streets of @entity117 yesterday as part of a solidarity march to show support for the magazine and the principle of free speech mr @entity6 , an outspoken proponent of the right to free speech , died on wednesday along with some of @entity127 's most revered cartoonists and magazine contributors			2
the dead included @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			0
according to witness reports , @entity49 and @entity50 burst in to the paper 's morning conference , then called out the names of the contributors they were looking for before pulling the trigger			1
since then millions have taken to @entity145 , posting messages of support along with the tag @entity107			0
millions took to the streets of @entity127 yesterday in solidarity marches waving banners that bore the slogan , while @entity154 and @entity155 wore @entity31 badges to last night 's @entity157			0
