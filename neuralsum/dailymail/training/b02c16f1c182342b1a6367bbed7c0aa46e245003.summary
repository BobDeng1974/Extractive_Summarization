the web search giant has come under fire recently after it was revealed it slashed more than £ 200million from its @entity16 tax bill last year using an elaborate structure			1
despite making sales of £ 2.6billion , taxpayers were left to fund the shortfall after @entity3 contributed just £ 6million to government coffers			2
the @entity23 company also faces charges of unfairly skewing search results to boost its own services above those of rivals , and of failing to take tough enough action with websites that promote illegal content			1
in addition @entity3 has been lambasted by child protection campaigners after its claims to have put effective safeguards on access to porn were called into question			2
but @entity1 , the company 's @entity16 policy chief , who was previously a senior policy adviser to @entity40 , insisted yesterday that @entity3 has been unfairly maligned			1
she used a wide - ranging meeting with the @entity42 to say : ' i genuinely think we make a substantive contribution … we obey by all the laws in the country and other countries we operate in			0
' it ’s not the case that we ’re the bogeyman [ of the internet ]			0
on the one hand we are seen as disruptive			0
on the other hand we are making [ other companies ] money			0
' mps were not pacified by her remarks , and described @entity3 as ' public enemy number one '			1
@entity61 , @entity62 mp for @entity63 and @entity64 , told @entity65 that @entity3 ’s stance on tax avoidance had angered ' honest , decent tax payers '			1
he said : ' it reflects how @entity70 was behaving on the phone hacking			0
they [ @entity3 and @entity70 ] are far too influential and powerful these days			2
' it emerged recently that the internet giant avoided paying $ 2billion of tax worldwide			2
the boss of @entity3 sparked outrage last week as he said that he was ‘ very proud ’ of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £ 200million from its @entity16 tax bill last year			1
mps on the influential @entity83 last month slammed the group ’s methods as ‘ immoral ’			0
@entity3 chairman @entity86 said he was ' very proud ' of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £ 200million from its @entity16 tax bill last year but when asked about the arrangement which saw the group funnel billions of pounds to @entity93 , a renowned tax haven , the company ’s chairman @entity86 said : ‘ it ’s called capitalism			1
’ mr @entity86 , who is estimated to be worth £ 4.6billion , said : ‘ we pay lots of taxes ; we pay them in the legally prescribed ways			0
‘ i am very proud of the structure that we set up			0
we did it based on the incentives that the governments offered us to operate			0
‘ it ’s called capitalism			0
‘ we are proudly capitalistic			0
i ’m not confused about this			0
’ ms @entity1 repeatedly told @entity82 it was ' way above my pay grade ' to comment on mr @entity86 's remarks			1
she said that @entity113 has been accused of illegal activity , unlike @entity3 , which has been investing heavily in combating piracy , taking down illegal links and tweaking search results to ensure that pirate websites appear further down search rankings			1
the news comes as the @entity121 set @entity3 an ultimatum yesterday after it was accused of intentionally manipulating its search results to harm competitors			1
the @entity121 have given it a month to come up with detailed proposals to resolve a two - year investigation into complaints that it used its power to block rivals , including @entity131			0
the @entity121 's antitrust chief , @entity133 , delivered the deadline in a meeting with @entity3 executive chairman @entity86 in @entity137			1
if it fails to address the complaints , the world 's most popular search engine could face a lengthy battle			2
if found guilty , it could mean a fine of up to 10 percent of its revenue , or $ 4 billion			0
it emerged recently that the internet search giant avoided paying $ 2billion of tax worldwide @entity133 said in a statement : ' since our preliminary talks with @entity3 started in july , we have substantially reduced our differences regarding possible ways to address each of the four competition concerns expressed by the @entity156			1
' on the basis of the progress made , i now expect @entity3 to come forward with a detailed commitment text in january 2013			2
' @entity3 has also come under fire recently for ' failing to stop easy access to porn ' despite tweaking search results in the @entity23 to hide x-rated images			1
the internet giant had changed its programming after earlier criticism so as to make x-rated pictures more difficult to find			0
but a trial carried out in the @entity23 by the @entity171 revealed that such images were still easily available			2
entering the word ' porn ' in a search on @entity3 brought up hundreds of x-rated pictures			1
the result brought into question @entity3 's claim that users in the @entity23 would have to be more specific if they wanted to view porn			1
the changes had affected users in the @entity23 only			2
those in the @entity16 do not at present have the supposedly improved programming and there is no timetable to bring it in .			0

mps described @entity3 as ' public enemy number one '
