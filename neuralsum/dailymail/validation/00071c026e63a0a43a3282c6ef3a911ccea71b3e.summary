@entity0 : @entity2 computers were compromised by intruders thought to be working from inside @entity4 the @entity2 , already beset with allegations that it has n't kept a tight enough leash on its officials ' email accounts , shut down some of its unclassified email servers on friday in order to clear out what sources say was a rash of malware inserted by foreign hackers			1
cybersecurity officials at @entity17 believe @entity4 hackers are to blame but described the breach of their networks only as ' activity of concern			2
' the @entity2 did its best to handle the problem quietly , making no announcement during the regular daily reporters ' briefing on friday and issuing a subdued statement 21 minutes before the end of the work day			0
@entity30 reported that the cyber intrusion is one of the most serious in the agency 's history			2
but @entity2 framed it as a ' planned outage ' and a routine ' upgrade ' to its digital security systems , blocking its employees from sending outside emails and shuttering their web browsers for an unspecified stretch of time that could last for days			0
' as a part of the @entity2 's ongoing effort to ensure the integrity of our unclassified networks against cyber attacks , ' spokeswoman @entity44 said in a statement , ' the @entity2 is implementing improvements to the security of its main unclassified network during a short , planned outage of some internet - linked systems			1
' ' @entity57 continues to closely monitor and respond to activity of concern on our unclassified network			0
such activity is something we take very seriously			0
' nothing to see here -- @entity65 ... @entity2 spokeswoman @entity44 downplayed the damage , saying that a ' planned outage ' was in the works @entity70 : hackers inserted malicious code into nonclassified computers at the @entity2 , leaving tech experts no choice but to shut everything down and clean it up ' there has been no compromise of any of the @entity2 's classified systems , nor of our core financial , consular , and human resource systems , ' @entity44 claimed			0
' the recent increase in news reports regarding cyber incidents reflects that the @entity2 is among a growing list of public institutions and private industries facing an increasing number of sophisticated cyber threats			0
' this is n't the first such outage to hit @entity94 's diplomatic nerve center : the same kind of event happened once in november when the @entity2 carried out what it called an ' upgrade ' following an october cyber attack			1
two @entity2 employees told @entity101 that they could n't reach websites from their office computers during the dinner hour on friday , and confirmed that no emails were going in or out other than interdepartmental messages			0
hackers have run roughshod over computer servers in the executive branch of the @entity94 government in recent years , targeting the @entity111 on a regular basis			1
in october , following an outage covering much of the @entity115 , @entity111 press secretary @entity113 told reporters it should ' not be particularly surprising ' that ' there are many people around the world who would love to gain greater insight into the activities of the @entity94 government by collecting information from the @entity111 network			1
' many did find it surprising , however , to hear @entity113 acknowledge that the computer infrastructure of @entity129 is ' subject to daily cyberattacks , or at least efforts to infiltrate it			0
' the @entity133 , the @entity134 and the @entity135 were all involved in an investigation , with insiders telling news organizations that – as with friday 's @entity2 trouble – @entity4 hackers were the most likely suspects			1
in august 2014 a cybersecurity firm discovered that @entity4 hackers had stolen 1.2 billion user names and passwords in a series of @entity147 heists affecting 420,000 websites			2
and a months - long sustained cyber attack on @entity150 last summer also originated in @entity4 , security officials believe , and may have also targeted as many as nine other banks			1
could it be ? @entity4 's government is still angry at the @entity156 administration for imposing tough eceonimc sanctions on the nation 's oligarchs following president @entity161 's annexation of @entity162 at least 83 million bank accounts were affected , mostly belonging to consumers but includnig about 7 million commercial customers as well			1
hackers got access to customers ' names , addresses , phone numbers and email addresses			0
saparately , the @entity133 offered a $ 3 million reward last month for information leading to the capture of a @entity4 hacker believed to be behind the electronic theft of $ 100 million from @entity94 bank accounts			1
@entity179 is accused of deploying a ' botnet ' – a hijacked super-network of personal computers controlled remotely without the owners ' knowledge – by spreading malicious software through spam emails			0
the @entity133 described @entity179 's technique last year as ' an extremely sophisticated type of malware designed specifically to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects			2

not the first time @entity94 's diplomatic nerve center has been compromised
@entity111 also had sustained cyber attacks last year
