by @entity0 deputy liberal leader @entity1 has flagged a possible end to the budget impasse by declaring the @entity4 should be prepared to compromise on key measures which are blocking its move through a hostile @entity8			1
the @entity10 administration has struggled to win the necessary support since it was delivered by @entity12 back in may and senior ministers have begun sending strong signals that ' adjustments ' will be made			2
however , @entity1 would not go as far as detailing what those changes could be			0
among the biggest stumbling blocks have been the proposed $ 7 gp co-payment , family benefit changes and university reforms			1
' that 's what negotiations should be ; finding constructive ways to work together to achieve the over-riding necessity of fixing the budget line , ' ms @entity1 added			2
prime minister @entity10 ( left ) and his treasurer @entity12 ( right ) have been urged by @entity4 colleagues to water down the budget to try and convince a hostile @entity8 the @entity39 proved so unpopular that @entity10 's standing as preferred prime minister dropped to historic low levels immediately after it was unveiled , along with a battering to the @entity4 's primary and two - party preferred support			1
finance minister @entity46 , who was the other man spotted by cameras enjoying cigars with @entity12 after the budget was delivered , agrees with a growing number of disgruntled @entity4 colleagues			1
where there 's smoke there 's ire			0
back in may , treasurer @entity12 and finance minister rejoiced in the @entity39 delivery with cigars but a hostile @entity8 has cut short those celebrations ' we are realists			1
we do know that the @entity60 parties only have 33 senators in the @entity8 , ' he told the @entity28			0
' we need six cross-bench senators or others to join with us to pass legislation in the @entity8			0
' it was always obvious there would have to be an adjustment here , an adjustment there , if we wanted to get some of those budget measures through the @entity70			2
' health minister @entity71 has indicated one of the most contentious reforms , to establish a $ 7 gp co-payment , could be altered			1
he believes talks with the cross-benchers have been ' productive '			0
' i 'm hopeful that the government can do a deal in relation to the @entity82 co-payment , because there 's certainly a lot of optimism from the senators - that 's my assessment , ' he told @entity87			0
independent @entity89 senator @entity88 ( right ) has all but dashed the hopes of senior government ministers like @entity71 ( minister for health ) that there 's reason for optimism the @entity39 will get through with ' amendments ' only			2
the senator says only ' major change ' will win his support for all the optimism from @entity4 ranks that adjustments could win the necessary support , a few words of warning have been delivered by key independent senator @entity88			1
in fact , he has made it clear that only major changes will win his backing			0
' when the government talks about an adjustment here , an adjustment there , it reminds me of going to the chiropractor - whereas , in fact , i think this budget needs some general anaesthetic and some radical surgery , ' he told @entity121 .			0

the deputy liberal leader flags compromises with all other parties
an *increasing* number of @entity4 colleagues are disgruntled and want the harshest budget measures watered down
$ 7 gp co-payment and family benefit cuts among the biggest stumbling blocks
@entity1 *insists* negotiations will need to take in all parties , ' including @entity25 , @entity26 and cross-benchers '
@entity46 , the finance minister and other man in the *post-budget* cigar smoking images with @entity12 , agrees ' adjustment ' is needed
senior ministers are optimistic alterations will win support but key independent senators have all but dashed those hopes , *insisting* only ' major change ' will get through
