by @entity1 reporter published : 10:45 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 21 november 2013 a former @entity3 aide who spent decades climbing through the ranks in @entity5 has revealed how the @entity6 was run by men who drank bourbon at all hours , had sex with secretaries and accepted thousands of dollars in bribes			1
@entity12 worked first as a page in the @entity3 , transferring phone calls and keeping track of vote counts , but grew his role so that he ended up being former president @entity19 ’s closest aide			1
@entity12 was eventually arrested for theft and tax evasion in 1967 , but he has now opened up to @entity22 about the lawless manner that dominated @entity5 at that time			1
the spy who loved me : president @entity29 allegedly had an affair with @entity31 ( right ) , the wife of a @entity28 army officer based in d.c. @entity29 feared she was a spy and would reveal their affair , so he had her deported strange bedfellows : then - congressman @entity35 ( seen here in 1966 ) also reportedly had an affair with the same woman and fbi director @entity39 had recordings of their time together investigators : @entity39 allegedly used the tape to blackmail @entity45 ( right ) who was a member of the @entity47 investigating president @entity29 's death because @entity39 wanted to know what they found out his most salacious revelation came about presidents @entity29 and @entity45 , who allegedly had affairs with the same @entity54 woman - who was later believed to be a spy			1
@entity12 knew @entity31 because she was the wife of a @entity28 army officer stationed in @entity5			1
she was ‘ as pretty as @entity60 ’ and the trappings of marriage did not stop her from making herself known to the president			0
‘ she really loved oral sex ... she went to the @entity62 several times			1
and president @entity29 called me and said it ’s the best head - job he ’d ever had , and he thanked me , ’ @entity12 said to @entity22			1
@entity31 was sent to @entity65 by the @entity67 leaders in @entity68 who hoped that she would befriend powerful politicians and report back			0
she went to @entity28 and married air force @entity70 who then moved with her to the @entity65			2
she began working as a hostess at the @entity73 , a salon for male politicians that was organized by @entity12			2
as part of her role there , she arranged prostitutes and went on dates with some of the men herself - which clearly led to influential connections			0
her alleged dalliances did not stop at the @entity62 , as she also had relations with then - congressman ‘ jerry ’ ford from @entity89 , who went on to become president after @entity91 resigned			1
@entity45 ’s relationship with ms @entity31 allegedly took place during his time on the @entity47 where he was tasked with investigating president @entity29 ’s assassination			2
the affair was used against him by @entity99 director @entity39 who was frustrated that the @entity47 was not sharing their findings , ‘ so , ( @entity39 ) had this tape where @entity35 was having oral sex with @entity31			1
you know , his wife had a serious drug problem back then … @entity39 blackmailed … @entity45 to tell him what they were doing , ’ @entity12 said			2
@entity107 and dealer : these salacious revelations were made public by @entity110 ( seen in 1964 ) who rose through the ranks in @entity5 and became a close personal aide to president @entity19 for @entity12 , that was crossing a line that should not be crossed , even in such a rule - averse atmosphere			1
‘ that ’s the reason i do n’t like him			0
it ’s just a misuse of authority , ’ @entity12 said			0
one use of power that did n’t seem to bother @entity12 was the fact that then - attorney general @entity29 had ms @entity125 deported back to @entity28 because he was afraid of word of his brother ’s affair with the possible @entity67 spy would leak after his death			1
the @entity132 affairs were far from the only instances of sexual impropriety that @entity12 revealed during his lengthy interview			2
he told of how @entity138 @entity137 senator @entity136 was having an affair with his secretary and asked @entity12 to have a page go ‘ buy him some rubbers ’ , and how senator @entity144 from @entity145 would use his role organizing a hearing about high school delinquency to prey on the youngsters who testified			2
‘ ( @entity144 ) had a bad alcohol problem and he also had a very bad record of wanting to go to bed with every woman he ever met			0
he got some of these young kids testifying , you know , before his @entity157 or something and then he could n’t wait to go to bed with them , ’ @entity12 said			0
‘ senator ( @entity161 ) @entity160 was a publicity hound			0
he was a very , very bright man , but he was another one — like senator @entity163 — he was a sex maniac			1
one of the postmen went in and caught him on his couch having a sexual affair with a @entity169 lady			0
he could n’t wait to come and tell me			0
’ power broker : @entity29 ( right ) reportedly called on @entity19 ( left ) to use @entity12 's connections to assess various vote counts and to see how he could pass different initiatives like @entity175 and the @entity176 the aura of free love was certainly helped by the endless streams of alcohol that went at all hours			1
@entity12 recalled how @entity181 and aides would regularly convene in offices with fully stocked bars - like that of @entity186 leader @entity186 who displayed a clock on with every number replaced with a ‘ 5 ’ so that no matter what time of day it was , it was always acceptable to drink			2
similarly , it was an unspoken understanding that votes in the @entity3 could be bought and entire towns could be given a price when it came to national elections			0
mixing business and pleasure : @entity12 was eventually jailed for tax evasion and theft ‘ it made my job much easier because a man that you have helped when he is running for his life , and he ’s run out of money , and you send him $ 50,000 , boy he is grateful …			0
we had no rules , ’ @entity12 said			0
in one instance , @entity12 was shocked to learn that a @entity138 senator from @entity213 - who should have supported president @entity29 ’s @entity175 program - had struck a deal with doctors in his home state who were opposed to the proposal and then bought off at least one fellow senator for $ 200,000			1
even getting president @entity29 in office cost a pretty penny , as @entity224 - a top aide to @entity29 ’s @entity138 rival @entity223 - revealed that the @entity228 man ’s family paid up to get him into the @entity62			1
‘ @entity230 , until his dying day , said that @entity223 would have defeated @entity29 … had it not been for that massive cash old man @entity232 [ @entity29 ] bought the election with , ’ @entity12 said			1
once in office , @entity29 clearly revelled in the role as @entity12 recalled a time the two of them were walking through the back offices of the @entity3 : ‘ we had these sofas and chairs , and there ’s the mirror where … @entity29 said , “ @entity244 , why did you make me so beautiful ? ” ’ in spite of the alcohol and ethical abuses that appear to be rampant in the 1950s and 1960s , he said that one way that the ‘ good old days ’ truly earned the title was because @entity249 and @entity138 worked together			2
@entity12 said that though his relationship with @entity19 ended poorly , still believes that the @entity254 president should be credited with one of the most important achievements in recent history			2
‘ when i see my @entity169 friends , i tell them , “ you go say a little prayer for @entity19			0
” because i said , “ the @entity176 made us all equal			0
” the only way in hell that senator @entity265 ever got elected president was because of the @entity176			0
i said , ‘ it ’s the greatest thing that ’s happened to our country , ’ @entity12 said .			0

@entity12 , a former aide to @entity19 has revealed how @entity5 was full of drunk , *philandering* politicians in @entity29 's era
