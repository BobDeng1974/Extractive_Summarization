by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’ hopes of winning four straight games as @entity6 manager have been boosted by news that @entity8 is approaching match fitness			1
few players embodied the up - and - down tenure of sacked @entity6 boss @entity12 better than @entity13			1
the @entity15 striker has struggled with injury all season and was not expected to play again this term after injuring his knee last month			1
but no sooner had @entity12 left than @entity13 was back in training at @entity37 and now interim manager @entity3 is refusing to rule out a return for the 30 - year - old this weekend against @entity40			1
asked about a return to action for @entity13 , @entity3 said : ‘ we ’ll just have to wait and see how he goes this week			1
he came back last friday and he trained well			0
‘ he just needs to work on his fitness now so , yeah , he looked great			0
’ @entity6 are continuing their talks with @entity35 manager @entity47 this week as they look to replace @entity12			2
the official line is that the club are talking to other candidates , but @entity51 remains the stand - out option and agreement could be announced by the end of the week			2
the future is orange ? @entity13 's national coach @entity47 ( @entity22 ) is expected to take over at @entity6 man hug : the @entity35 striker had a special relationship with sir @entity60 after joining @entity6 there were suggestions in @entity35 last night that one sticking point may be the size of the coaching entourage he wishes to bring to @entity66			1
@entity6 , though , said privately last week that they were willing to be flexible on that matter			0
the @entity15 @entity68 are understood to want the situation clarified so their plans for the summer ’s @entity71 are not too badly affected			0
@entity6 are sympathetic but can not afford to make an appointment without considering all candidates — a mistake they appeared to make when giving @entity12 the job after sir @entity60 ’s retirement			0
homegrown : many @entity6 supporters would like to see @entity3 get the job permanently just like old times : @entity3 has brought @entity80 ( r ) back in to coach at @entity66 jump for joy : @entity83 celebrates scoring in the 4 - 0 win against @entity86 - @entity3 ' first game @entity3 won his first game in charge 4 - 0 against @entity86 on saturday and has winnable games against @entity40 on saturday then @entity89 a week tonight , before a trip to @entity91 on may 11			1
the @entity92 being in charge has seemingly already lifted the atmosphere and reserve goalkeeper @entity94 offered an insight as to what the 40 - year - old has brought to the dressing room in his new role			0
writing in a newspaper in @entity102 , @entity94 said : ‘ some might question whether it can work to go from being a team - mate to the manager from one day to the next			1
‘ normally i have my reservations , but @entity3 ’ case is another matter			0
‘ @entity3 has always held a kind of professional distance to his team - mates			2
‘ he opened his mouth when it was relevant and people have always listened			0
@entity15 of class : @entity13 will be hoping to replicate the form that helped @entity6 win the title last season cut from the same cloth : @entity3 bears managerial similarities to @entity60 , according to @entity94 ‘ the parallels with sir @entity60 are striking , and it is clear that @entity3 has been learning from the most awe - inspiring football manager			1
‘ his last speech before the team went on the pitch before the match against @entity86 was spine - tingling in a way that i have only experienced from sir @entity60			0
‘ it probably sounds rather naive and impetuous but to me we are dealing with a new @entity132			0
’ @entity134 assistant manager @entity133 has ruled himself out of a return to @entity66 as @entity51 ’s deputy .			2

@entity13 could return to play under @entity3 after *recovering* from injury
@entity15 was expected to be *sidelined* for rest of the season
the striker 's national coach @entity51 is expected to take over from @entity12
@entity94 has backed @entity3 to continue after a rousing team talk
