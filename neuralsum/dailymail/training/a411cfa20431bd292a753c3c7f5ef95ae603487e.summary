@entity7 apologised for putting out a guidance note which told solicitors to draw up sharia wills that give male heirs double the amounts inherited by women			1
pictured : the @entity20 of @entity21 in @entity22 @entity23 , president of the professional body for solicitors , said : ‘ we reviewed the note in the light of criticism			1
we have withdrawn the note and we are sorry			2
’ the guidance , issued to lawyers amid deep controversy in the spring , was seen as a major advance for sharia law			1
the religious legal code is seen by critics as discriminating against women and running contrary to basic principles of @entity42 law			0
it told solicitors drawing up wills for @entity47 clients who wanted their estates distributed according to sharia rules : ‘ the male heirs in most cases receive double the amount inherited by a female heir of the same class			1
‘ non-muslims may not inherit at all , and only @entity47 marriages are recognised			0
’ the guidance said divorced husbands or wives can not inherit under sharia rules , and instructed lawyers : ‘ you should amend clauses which define the term children or issue to exclude those who are illegitimate or adopted			1
’ inheritance law allows people to leave as much as they like to whoever they like in their wills			1
but the @entity7 came under heavy criticism after issuing the advice			2
the organisation , which operates firm equality rules , was seen as encouraging its members to collude in discriminating against women and others who are disadvantaged under sharia law			0
inheritance law allows people to leave as much as they like to whoever they like in wills ( file picture ) mr @entity23 said : ‘ our practice note was intended to support members to better serve their clients as far as is allowed by the law of @entity42 and @entity87			2
’ the @entity88 , which had been pressing the @entity7 to withdraw the advice , said it welcomed the decision			2
director @entity91 said : ‘ this is an important reversal for what had seemed to be the relentless march of sharia to becoming @entity21 law			0
' until now , politicians and the legal establishment either encouraged this process or spinelessly recoiled from acknowledging what was happening			0
‘ this is particularly good news for women who fare so badly under sharia law , which is a non-democratically determined , non-human rights compliant and discriminatory code			0
’ @entity106 rulings are made by an estimated 85 tribunals attached to mosques throughout the country			0
the decisions made in them have no force in @entity42 law , but operate on a voluntary basis , with all parties agreeing to be bound by rulings			0
@entity42 courts often rubber stamp sharia court decisions			0
in divorce cases , for example , a judge will in many cases examine documents and forms submitted after a decision in a sharia tribunal and declare the divorce official in @entity42 law sharia law has gained growing respectability , particularly on the political left , since 2003 , when the then archbishop of canterbury @entity129 said @entity21 courts might recognise sharia tribunals and that official acceptance of sharia ‘ seems unavoidable ’ .			0
