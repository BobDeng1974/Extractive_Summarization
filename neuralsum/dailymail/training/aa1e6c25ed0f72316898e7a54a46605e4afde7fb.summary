by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 16:12 est , 29 august 2012 a growing number of young women are seeking vaginal rejuvenation according to experts			1
the hour - long procedure which was originally popular with patients suffering from incontinence or a sagging of the vaginal canal following childbirth , is now more widely used for cosmetic purposes to either to enhance the appearance of the genitalia or boost sexual satisfaction			2
while the average age of those requesting the surgery is between 30 - 45 some doctors are concerned the trend is causing teenagers to become increasingly ' misled or confused ' about what is normal			1
media influence : this june @entity23 , one of the stars of a reality show on @entity26 called @entity27 , underwent vaginal laser rejuvenation while the cameras rolled ' it 's really concerning , because [ the trend ] is really reaching younger ages , in their teens			2
' i heard of a mother taking in a 16 - year - old and 11 - year - old wanting to get it done			1
it 's just not right , ' dr @entity38 , a @entity39 , gynecologist , noted in an editorial in the june issue of the journal @entity43			1
critics believe it is yet another service aimed at women pursuing an impossible ideal of physical perfection , and surgeons say the majority of patients have been influenced by internet pornography and the media industry			2
one patient said she looked at ' a few @entity55 here and there ' before opting for labiaplasty dr. @entity59 who trained as a gynecologist and reconstructive surgeon , and now calls himself a ' medical tailor , ' specializes in surgery to reshape a woman 's private parts			1
on average he performs as many as 180 labiaplasties a year to cut back the skin flaps surrounding the vaginal opening			2
there are two main types of procedure available : @entity73 @entity74 by all measures , @entity59 has thrived on his expertise and along with his partner dr. @entity77 , now has practices in @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
in 2011 more than 2,140 @entity83 women underwent vaginal rejuvenation , according to the @entity85 while the @entity86 put the total at almost 5,200 in 2010			0
experts note such figures do not include the many procedures done by gynecologists			0
and last year , according to @entity92 figures the demand for genital cosmetic surgery in the @entity95 rose five-fold over the course of a decade			1
' more women today are concerned about the aesthetics of their private parts			0
' the concept of beauty has extended from having the right looking cheeks to the right looking genitals , ' dr @entity100 told @entity106			1
the growth comes despite a warning from the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) in 2007 that strongly questioned the medical validity and safety of female genital cosmetic surgery which can cost between $ 2,500 and $ 12,000			1
one of the major concerns is that many surgeons fail to explain risks , such as infections , scarring , pain and the loss of the very sensations some patients seek to enhance			0
' none of these procedures have proven effectiveness , and there is potential for harm , ' dr @entity38 added			1
however many patients are more than happy to proceed with surgery , even when warned of the dangers , as they are sold on the idea of having a ' designer vagina '			2
' even when women are told of potential complications , like insensitivity of the clitoris ... they still may be unstoppable if they have the notion that they need a younger - looking or more perfect or more desirable vulva , ' said @entity139 , a psychologist specialising in women 's issues			0
@entity142 , 36 , who did not want to use her last name , said she was unhappy with the way her genitalia looked and opted for labiaplasty			0
' one side was longer than the other side			0
... it was something that bothered me			0
' she said her boyfriend was not involved in her decision , but she did ' look at a few @entity55 here and there			0

doctors *report* children as young as 11 seeking surgery
' the concept of beauty has extended from having the right looking cheeks to the right looking genitals , ' says dr @entity100
