she 's famous for her poise but even @entity3 @entity2 , 42 , could n't help taking a step back when confronted with an angry - looking bull during a visit to a farm show			1
and the enormous beast was n't the only one to leave her with ruffled feathers			0
an @entity12 horse that shied while being gingerly petted by the royal also had her reeling back to safety			1
by contrast , husband @entity16 , 46 , appeared to take a shine to the horse although even he looked a little on the nervous side while holding the bull 's lead rope			1
taking a step back : @entity2 takes cover behind husband @entity16 as they get close to a bull during a fair not a fan : @entity2 jerks back in alarm after the @entity12 horse she was petting shied and tossed its head happily , the 6ft 5 " monarch soon had beasts of a smaller size to contend with and was spotted towering over a flock of sheep while enjoying a chat with their owner			1
@entity2 , meanwhile , went outside to meet the crowds waiting outside the venue in @entity39 , a town in @entity42 's southern @entity41 region , where she was soon busy with selfies			2
she also had a close encounter of an altogether more amenable kind , when she plucked a young well - wisher out of her mother 's arms for a cuddle - much to the family 's delight			0
the trip to the @entity52 in @entity39 was a far cry from yesterday 's business , which saw the @entity42 royal couple welcome president @entity55 of the @entity57 and his wife to @entity42			0
@entity57 ' presidential couple were welcomed at the @entity60 in @entity61 as they began a state visit to @entity42 with a formal reception			0
gingerly does it : @entity2 gives the horse a nervous pat.			2
. but @entity16 appears to be enjoying himself enormous : even 6ft 5 " @entity16 looked a little nervous during his close encounter with the huge bull much less frightening : @entity16 looked animated as he got involved in a discussion about sheep @entity2 , who opted for a businesslike grey suit and white shirt for today 's visit , was glamorous in a cerise @entity77 dress for the event			1
@entity16 , meanwhile , was dapper in a navy suit with a pink tie that matched his wife 's ensemble - a trick he repeated in @entity39 with a suit that came in an identical shade of grey to @entity2 's			1
the @entity42 royals have had a busy schedule to contend with of late , with a visit to @entity89 last week followed by a series of engagements at home in @entity42			0
earlier this week , the couple enjoyed a rapturous reception as they arrived at the @entity95 in @entity96 ahead of a reception with academics			0
it is n't the first time the couple have spent time with academics in recent weeks , with a visit to meet @entity42 intellectuals working in @entity89 included in their @entity107 trip at the end of last month			0
the visit , which saw @entity2 reunited with her old friend @entity110 , saw @entity16 make a speech at the @entity112 in which he called for @entity42 to be given a temporary seat on the @entity114			2
big improvement : @entity2 beams as she 's introduced to a baby girl by her family during the visit to @entity39 cuddle from a queen : a young well - wisher gets a hug from @entity123 - much to her family 's delight much better : @entity2 stops to pose for a selfie with a well - wisher during a walkabout in @entity39 all smiles : @entity2 , clearly relieved to be away from the animals , posed for several photos during her walkabout			2

@entity2 kept a safe *distance* - and @entity16 - between her and the bull
she was also left reeling when an @entity12 horse she was petting shied
@entity16 , meanwhile , looked much more at ease with the farm animals
