by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 search crews have reportedly located the black box from missing @entity5			1
@entity7 radio station @entity6 tweeted the discovery , citing aviation expert @entity9 had revealed the flight recorder had finally been found after more than a month of being missing			2
prime minister @entity11 , who is in @entity12 , said he is ' very confident ' the signals detected were from the black box from @entity5			1
' we have a series of detections , some lasting for quite a long period of time			0
' we 're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade			1
we 're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires			2
' i really do n't want to give any more information than that at this stage ... as a sign of respect to the @entity12 people and their families			0
' speaking from @entity56 , @entity12 , mr @entity11 said today 's discovery was a huge step in solving the mystery			1
' this is probably the most difficult search in human history , ' he said			0
' among tragedy , however , there is hope			0
' we are confident we know the position of the black box to the nearest kilometre			1
' but confidence in the position is not the same as recovering the wreckage from more than 4.5km beneath the sea and finally determining all that happened on that flight			0
' the fact that mr @entity11 has reportedly used the word ' confident ' suggests that searchers are finally convinced that weeks of scouring the @entity20 might now have resulted in the discovery of the missing @entity80			1
mr @entity11 has indicated he will first need to brief the @entity12 because most of the 239 passengers were from that country			1
relatives have complained in the past of not being kept informed of progress in the search			0
a fifth ' ping ' from the black box of missing @entity5 was detected by a surveillance plane conducting an acoustic search yesterday , @entity25 officials said			1
the latest signal was picked up by an @entity25 p - 3 orion aircraft , with on - board instruments tracing it to the same area where two pings were heard this week by @entity25 ship @entity24			1
more signals : a handout image released by the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) shows the search area in the @entity20 , @entity102 of @entity25 , where 15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight mh370 more than a month after it disappeared a map from @entity100 shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight mh370 air chief marshal @entity29 , who is co-ordinating the search in @entity7 , said on thursday : ' the acoustic data will require further analysis overnight but shows potential of being from a man - made source			1
' earlier he said the discovery by @entity24 was ' further encouraging ' news in the search for @entity5			1
he said the detection , on tuesday afternoon , was held for about five minutes and 32 seconds , while the second was held for about seven minutes			2
' yesterday 's [ tuesday 's ] signals will assist in better defining a reduced and much more manageable search area on the ocean floor ' he said			1
despite what mr @entity29 described as ' further encouraging findings ' he said that the underwater vehicle ' @entity130 21 ' , which can ' sniff out ' objects deep in the ocean , would not be launched until the search area could be narrowed			2
' i believe we are searching in the right area , but we need to visually identify aircraft wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of @entity5 , ' he said			1
' i 'm not prepared to confirm anything until such time as somebody lays eyes on the wreckage			0
' however , @entity145 captain @entity144 said the detections indicate the device emitting the pings is somewhere within about a 12 - mile radius			2
that would still equate to a 500 square mile chunk of the ocean floor - an area that would take the @entity155 sub between six weeks to two months to canvas			2
data analysis of the first two detections at the weekend has shown they were consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder , said the air chief marshal			0
the @entity25 @entity164 based at @entity165 in @entity166 , on the @entity168 coast south of @entity169 , concluded that the two detections were from a source that was not of ' natural origin ' and was ' likely sourced ' from specific electronic equipment			1
mr @entity29 , pointing out that his optimism had risen since sunday , warned that a lot of silt could complicate the search , which is being boosted by a sonar buoy and a modified @entity180 aircraft to co-ordinate with @entity24			0
' it 's important for @entity24 to collect as much data as possible ahead of deploying @entity130 21 , ' he said			0
' the reason we want to do that is there 's no second chances			0
' the pings detected by the @entity25 defence vessel @entity24 's pinger locator in the search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in the southern @entity20 may now not be released the towed pinger locator ( @entity195 - 25 ) on the deck of the @entity197 detected two signals which were thought to be from a black box transponder , but further analysis has shown the signals may have no connection with @entity5 the @entity155 21 submarine drone , which will be used to scour the seabed for @entity5 once the search area in narrowed down further , is hosited on board the @entity197 after buoyanct testing he warned that the recently - detected signals have been much weaker than the original signals detected - ' so that means probably we 're either a long way from it , or in my view , more likely , the batteries are starting to fade and as a consequence the signal is becoming weaker			1
' he added : ' so we need to , as we say in @entity25 , make hay while the sun shines			2
' @entity24 , he said , would be looking to pick up more transmissions that would help to better pinpoint where the signal was coming from			0
once the search area has been narrowed , ships and aircraft could then find something in ' a matter of days , ' he suggested			2
he continued to express optimism that searchers were closing in on the plane 's final resting place , despite what he believed were signals from dying batteries			2
@entity155 21 , takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator , which is pulled behind the boat at a depth of 3,000 metres			0
a @entity180 @entity243 is seen parked on the tarmac after returning from a search mission for debris from missing @entity5 yesterday @entity248 confidence of @entity250 commodore @entity249 ( pictured , right , with search chief @entity29 last month ) of the recorded pings being from missing @entity5 has now waned the sub 's sonar can scan only about 100 metres and it can ' see ' with lights and cameras only a few metres			1
the maximum depth it can dive is 4,500 metres , and some areas of the search zone are deeper			0
search crews are also contending with a thick layer of silt on the sea floor that can both hide any possible wreckage and distort the sounds emanating from the black boxes that may be resting there , said mr @entity249 , who is helping to lead the search			0
captain @entity144 said : ' it 's certainly a man - made device emitting that signal and i have no explanation for what other component could be there			1
' i 'm an engineer so i do n't talk emotions too much			0
but certainly when i received word that they had another detection , you feel elated			0
' you 're hopeful that you can locate the final resting place of the aircraft and bring closure to all the families involved			0

*unconfirmed* reports have surfaced that @entity5 's black box has been found
@entity25 prime minister @entity11 said he is ' very confident ' the signals are from @entity5
latest signal picked up in area where other pings have been heard
it was detected by an @entity25 p - 3 orion surveillance aircraft
' shows potential of being from man - made source ' - @entity25 official
possible black box signals heard for several minutes earlier this week
