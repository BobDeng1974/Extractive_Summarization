@entity1 world of engineers who worked on @entity3 , the giant @entity5 satellite project in 15 years 20 satellites were launched snapping vast areas of the @entity8 and @entity9 by @entity10 last updated at 3:37 pm on 26th december 2011 for more than a decade they toiled in the strange , boxy - looking building on the hill above the municipal airport , the building with no windows , the building filled with secrets			1
they wore protective white jumpsuits , and had to walk through air - shower chambers before entering the sanitized ' cleanroom ' where the equipment was stored in the building in @entity26 , @entity27			2
few knew the true identity of ' the customer ' they met in a smoke - filled , wood - paneled conference room where the phone lines were scrambled			2
when they traveled , they sometimes used false names , the @entity10 reports			2
now declassified : an image released by the @entity37 shows an engineer next to a satellite control section from the @entity3 program which brought back precise images from abroad at one point in the 1970s there were more than 1,000 people in the @entity26 area working on ' @entity46			1
' though they worked long hours under intense deadlines , sometimes missing family holidays and anniversaries , they could tell no one - not even their wives and children - what they did			1
they were engineers , scientists , draftsmen and inventors - ' real cloak - and - dagger guys , ' says @entity60 , 78 , with a hearty laugh			1
he is sitting in the food court at the @entity63 , where a group of retired co-workers from the former @entity66 gather for a weekly coffee			2
@entity70 now and hard of hearing , they have been meeting here for 18 years			1
they while away a few hours nattering about golf and politics , ailments and grandchildren			0
but until recently , they were forbidden to speak about the greatest achievement of their professional lives			0
' ah , @entity3 , ' @entity81 says , gleefully exhaling the word that stills feels almost treasonous to utter in public			1
it was dubbed ' @entity84 ' and it was considered the most successful space spy satellite program of the @entity87 era			1
from 1971 to 1986 a total of 20 satellites were launched , each containing 60 miles of film and sophisticated cameras that orbited the earth snapping vast , panoramic photographs of the @entity8 , @entity9 and other potential foes			1
the brains behind the project : former @entity3 workers , from left in top row , @entity97 , @entity60 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity81 , and @entity100 , seated at center , hold declassified documents old times : @entity60 listens as @entity97 describes the camera on the @entity3 secret spy satellite			1
the men meet and chat about their lives - but until recently were unable to talk of the secretive work they carried out the film was shot back through the earth 's atmosphere in buckets that parachuted over the @entity115 , where @entity118 @entity117 planes snagged them with grappling hooks			0
the scale , ambition and sheer ingenuity of @entity84 was breathtaking			0
the fact that 19 out of 20 launches were successful ( the final mission blew up because the booster rockets failed ) is astonishing			2
so too is the human tale of the 45 - year - old secret that many took to their graves			0
@entity3 was declassified in september			1
finally @entity60 , @entity81 and others can tell the world what they worked on all those years at ' the office			1
' ' my name is @entity138 and i built spy satellites for a living , ' announced the 64 - year - old retired engineer to the stunned bartender in his local tavern as soon as he learned of the declassification			2
' it was intensely demanding , thrilling and the greatest experience of my life , ' says @entity138 , who was hired straight from college and was one of the youngest members of the @entity3 ' brotherhood			1
' he describes the excitement as teams pored over hand - drawings and worked on endless technical problems , using ' slide - rules and advanced degrees ' ( there were no computers ) , knowing they were part of such a complicated space project			1
the intensity would increase as launch deadlines loomed and on the days when ' the customer ' - the @entity167 and later the @entity117 - came for briefings			0
on at least one occasion , former president @entity169 , who was then @entity167 director , flew into @entity26 for a tour of the plant			0
engineer : @entity97 holds a stained photo of himself standing next to a shipping container for a spy satellite memories : @entity81 , left , and @entity60 , right , reminisce about their work throughout the 1970s			2
the operations were so secretive , workers were not even allowed to tell their families what they did though other companies were part of the project - @entity186 made the film and @entity189 built the satellite - the cameras and optics systems were all made at @entity66 , then the biggest employer in @entity26			1
' there were many days we arrived in the dark and left in the dark , ' says retired engineer @entity197 , 70			0
he recalls the very first briefing on @entity3 after @entity66 was awarded the top secret contract in 1966			1
looking around the room at his 30 or so colleagues , @entity197 thought , ' how on @entity202 is this going to be possible ? ' one thing that made it possible was a hiring frenzy that attracted the attention of top engineers from around the north east			2
@entity66 also commissioned a new 270,000 - square - foot building for @entity3 — the boxy one on the hill			1
waiting for clearance was a surreal experience as family members , neighbors and former employers were grilled by the @entity217 , and potential hires were questioned about everything from their gambling habits to their sexuality			0
eyes in the skies : a film canister from the @entity3 program is parachuted to @entity202 before it is picked by a plane for recovery shrouded in secrecy : a satellite transporter near the @entity231 in @entity26 , @entity27 ' they wanted to make sure we could n't be bribed , ' @entity60 says			1
clearance could take up to a year			0
during that time , employees worked on relatively minor tasks in a building dubbed ' the mushroom tank ' - so named because everyone was in the dark about what they had actually been hired for			2
@entity243 , 76 , spent six months in the tank			0
when he was finally briefed on @entity3 , @entity243 , who had worked as an engineer on earlier civil space projects , wondered if he had made the biggest mistake of his life			1
' i thought they were crazy , ' he says			0
' they envisaged a satellite that was 60 - foot long and 30,000 pounds and supplying film at speeds of 200 inches per second			2
the precision and complexity blew my mind			0
' several years later , after numerous successful launches , he was shown what @entity3 was capable of — an image of his own house in suburban @entity265			1
' this was light years before @entity267 , ' @entity243 said			2
' and we could clearly see the pool in my backyard			0
' according to the @entity37 , a single @entity3 frame covered a ground distance of 370 nautical miles , about the distance from @entity274 to @entity275			1
early @entity3 averaged 124 days in space , but as the satellites became more sophisticated , later missions lasted twice as long			1
catching up : former @entity3 program worker @entity100 , right , discusses the project at a mall in @entity26 , @entity27			1
at first , some of the men thought the precise task would be impossible recounting : from left , @entity97 , @entity81 , @entity60 and @entity100 remember the hours they spent on the project that became so significant - yet remained secret - during the @entity87 ' at the height of the @entity87 , our ability to receive this kind of technical intelligence was incredible , ' says space historian @entity292			2
' we needed to know what they were doing and where they were doing it , and in particular if they were preparing to invade @entity300			0
@entity3 created a tremendous amount of stability because it meant @entity5 decision makers were not operating in the dark			1
' from the outset , secrecy was a huge concern , but it was impossible to conceal the launches at @entity310 in @entity311 , and aviation magazines made several references to @entity84			0
in 1975 , a @entity315 television piece on space reconnaissance described an @entity318 world , where @entity5 and @entity8 intelligence officials knew of each other 's ' eyes in the sky ' - and other nations did , too - but no one confirmed the programs or spoke about them publicly			1
@entity66 was considered a prized place to work , with good salaries and benefits , golf and softball leagues , lavish summer picnics ( the company would hire an entire amusement park for employees and their families ) and dazzling children 's @entity338 parties			0
the city 's mayor , @entity26 , only discovered that his father had worked on @entity3 when he was invited to speak at an october reunion ceremony on the grounds of the former plant			1
his father , @entity346 , also a former mayor , was too ill to attend and died a few days later			0
the painstaking work was carried with the aid of slide - rules and advanced degrees in the pre-computer age ' learning about @entity3 makes me view him completely differently , ' @entity346 says			1
' he was more than just my dad with the hair - trigger temper and passionate opinions about everything			0
he was a @entity87 warrior doing something incredibly important for our nation			0
' for @entity361 the ceremony was bittersweet , too			0
not only did she learn about the mystery of her late husband 's professional life			0
she also learned about his final moments			0
' all these years , ' she said , ' i had wondered what exactly had happened ' on that terrible day in 1987 when she received a phone call saying her 53 - year - old husband , @entity370 , a contract negotiator , had suffered a heart attack on the job			2
at the reunion she met former co-workers who could offer some comfort that the end had been quick			0
standing in the grounds of her late husband 's workplace , listening to the tributes , her son and daughter and grandchildren by her side , @entity361 was overwhelmed by the enormity of it all — the sacrifice , the secrecy , the pride			0
' to know that this was more than just a company selling widgets ... that he was negotiating contracts for our country 's freedom and security , ' she said			0
