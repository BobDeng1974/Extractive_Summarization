@entity4 , 11 , suffers from a rare disease that makes her look 80 and will likely not live past 15			1
she was given the donation from @entity7 ( @entity8 ) in 2010 so she could go for a once - in - a - lifetime trip to swim with dolphins			1
blasting his actions as ' callous and despicably devious ' , the judge at @entity25 jailed @entity12 for three years			1
the court heard @entity13 , who has @entity28 , was selected by her local biking club in @entity30 to receive a year 's worth of charity money to go on her dream holiday			1
at every event she attended , she was accompanied by her father @entity12 , who claimed her mother @entity36 , his ex , was ill or busy			1
when they were finally presented with the money in december 2010 he told organisers to put the cheque in his name to book the trip			2
plight : @entity4 , 11 , suffers from the ageing disease @entity28 and is unlikely to live past 15 betrayed : her mother @entity36 knew nothing about the donation until after her ex-partner had used it but two months later , @entity13 and her mother attended an event at the club - and when organisers mentioned the money , she knew nothing about it			1
distraught , ms @entity4 told @entity56 : ' knowing he stole from her killed me inside			1
to me it 's the same as abuse , and it 's heartbreaking for @entity13 to know he has ruined her wish			0
' defending his actions , @entity12 told the jury he was saving the money in his mother 's safe for @entity13 's funeral			1
a fatal genetic disease , @entity71 accelerates the appearance of ageing			1
it is commonly referred to simply as @entity28 , the @entity76 word for ' prematurely old '			2

children with @entity28 are born looking healthy and start showing signs at 18 months			1
symptoms include stunted growth , hair loss , weight loss , wrinkled skin , stiff joints , and heart disease			2
sufferers commonly die of heart disease at an average age of 13 years old			2
but when police approached his parents , they said they had not seen their son for four years			2
he then claimed to have buried the thousands of pounds in his garden			0
again , police found nothing			0
@entity102 , @entity8 social secretary , said : ' it is disgusting			0
we never had any reason to suspect him			0
' we met @entity13 in 2009 and we were really moved by her situation			0
we heard she wanted to go to @entity17 so planned a year of events - fun runs , curry nights , quiz nights ... anything			1
' a lot of the members put a lot of their own money into it			0
' @entity12 brought @entity13 to every event and told us her mum , @entity118 , was ill. how would we know he was lying ? he seemed to be looking after her fine			2
' on the final day , a 60s themed charity @entity121 , we gave her a big cheque for £ 3,500 , and he asked us to put the name @entity125 on it			1
' we had n't heard anything so in february when @entity13 's mother came to the club we asked her about their plans			2
it turned out she knew nothing about it			0
' it is disgusting , a really sad sad case			0
' presentation : this is the moment @entity13 and @entity12 were presented with the cheque at the biking club party organisers said @entity12 seemed doting when he and @entity13 's sister @entity142 ( left ) came to the event shaken by the experience , the club now refuses to sponsor any individual cases			1
' it is really sad			0
there are so many people that need help that we want to help , but this has scared our members			0
' how do we know where our money is going ? we want to get the money back and pay for the trip ourselves , but it does n't look like we can			0
it is just really , really sad			0
