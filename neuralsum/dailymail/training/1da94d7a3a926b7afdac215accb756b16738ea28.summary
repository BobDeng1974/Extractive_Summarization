brave : dr @entity9 secretly hid @entity24 in his cottage near @entity13 to save her from being sent to a death camp like @entity27 , in occupied @entity28 , pictured , guarded by armed nazis but the family of the heroic doctor - the first @entity32 ever to be recognised for his bravery in such a way - say they want nothing to do with it			1
' if any other country offered to honor @entity9 , we would have been happy with it , ' said @entity40 , the wife of @entity9 ’s great - nephew			0
' but not from @entity8			0
i do , however , respect @entity43 as a religion , and i respect @entity2			0

born in 1901 in @entity47 , in what was then @entity10 and is now @entity49 , to an @entity10 father and a @entity52 mother , he went to @entity13 in 1922 - 11 years before the @entity29 came to power - to study medicine			0
in 1938 the @entity54 , intended to remove @entity2 from all spheres of public life , were enacted against him when he was banned from his medical practice because racial quacks said he was not considered ' @entity59 ' - the term nazis used to denote those they considered unworthy of equal status with @entity52			2

dr @entity9 hid 21 - year - old @entity24 , a family friend , at a cottage on the outskirts of the city , and provided her relatives with medical care against the strict instructions of the @entity88 high command			1
after @entity24 ’s relatives admitted to @entity91 interrogators that he was hiding her he arranged for her to hide at an acquaintance ’s house			2
@entity24 and four family members eventually escaped to @entity8			1
' the @entity91 knew that dr @entity9 was our family physician , and they knew that he owned a cottage			1
he managed to evade all their interrogations , ' @entity24 , later mrs @entity97 , wrote after the war , according to @entity11 ’s citation			2
' dr @entity9 did everything for me out of the generosity of his heart , and i will be grateful to him for eternity			1
' @entity11 painstakingly tries to recognise the bravery of all non-jews who risked their own lives to help others			2
perhaps the most famous of the @entity16 heroes is @entity112 , the @entity52 industrialist immortalised in the @entity114 film @entity113 who saved almost the entire @entity2 workforce of his factory in @entity118 , @entity28 , from death in the gas chambers			0
the late dr @entity9 's family refuse to accept the certificate , shown here by @entity124 , an official at @entity8 's @entity126 memorial dr @entity9 's family in @entity10 reject the award because it comes from @entity8 - based @entity11 , which remembers those who risked their lives to save @entity2			1
