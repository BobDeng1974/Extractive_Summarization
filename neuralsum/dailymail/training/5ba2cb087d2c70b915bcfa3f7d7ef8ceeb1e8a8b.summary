this is the stunning optical illusion that appears to make a building at one of @entity5 's busiest tourist districts hover in mid-air			1
to passers - by , it looks as though a section of the historic market building in @entity11 has broken free from its foundations and is floating unaided , high above them			1
but in reality , the display , which imitates the architecture in the area , is a complicated piece of technical wizardry which took months to create			2
it seems as though the 184 - year - old market building has been torn off and is levitating with a large gap between the broken ' stone ' walls , pillars and doors			1
the 12 - metre - long sculpture has been made from a steel frame and a type of expanded polystyrene called filcor			0
it is understood to have taken 500 hours to paint using special digital techniques and was designed to resemble the existing architecture in the area			1
the structure itself has been going up since the weekend using cranes , a number of trucks and cherry pickers			0
the 12 - metre - long sculpture has been made from a steel frame and a type of expanded polystyrene called filcor			0
it is understood to have taken 500 hours to paint using special digital techniques and was designed to resemble the existing architecture in the area although it is his most ambitious project to date , it is not the first piece of trickery mr @entity24 has created			1
in the past , using similar techniques , he appeared to have turned a house upside down in @entity122 , @entity5 the illusion of it floating is created by a four - tonne counterweight strong enough to support the top half of the structure as it hangs over the bottom half finishing touches : men on cherry - pickers work on the upper levels of the artwork , while another man stands on top of the green stall that acts as a counterweight a couple try to work out how the building appears to float in mid-air			1
take my @entity21 but do n’t steal my @entity23 and will be on display in @entity143 until october 24 the illusion of it floating is created by using a heavy counterweight strong enough to support the top half of the structure as it hangs over the bottom half			1
a steel beam is hidden inside the green market stall to the side of the building and this is attached to a steel platform and a 12 - metre cantilever			2
although it is his most ambitious project to date , it is not the first piece of trickery mr @entity24 has created			2
in the past , using similar techniques , he appeared to have turned a house upside down in @entity122 , @entity5			0
under construction : workers in hard hats and hi - vis jackets work through the night on the work of art , layering plaster on the outside to make the stone columns feel real perfection : a man checks the paintwork finish on the building , which was designed to exactly match the architecture in the area and enhance the illusion as if by magic : workers busy themselves creating the optical illusion , while part of the steel supporting beam attached to the green wagon can be seen , right he told the @entity185 : ' you ca n't tell the difference between the fake and the real thing , to touch it , to see it			1
' as long as as many people enjoy it as possible , that 's my aim			0
it 's a logistical minefield that you have to navigate to get to a fun conclusion			0
' i did n't get into art for that , but that 's what i do			0
' take my @entity21 but do n’t steal my @entity23 and will be on display in @entity143 until october 24			0
the art of illusion : how artist ' melted ' one house and appeared to turn another building upside down @entity24 's latest project in @entity11 is just his latest venture in messing with archaeology with mind - bending results			1
in october last year the @entity215 - based artist created a project in @entity217 called from the knees of my nose to the belly of my toes , which featured the facade of a derelict house appearing to slide off and into the front garden			2
the property had recently been purchased by @entity226 after sitting empty for more than 11 years , and mr @entity24 persuaded ten companies to donate £ 100,000 in materials and resources to make the project a reality			2
melting away : in october last year mr @entity24 also created this installation in @entity217 , called from the knees of my nose to the belly of my toes abandoned : the house had recently been purchased by @entity226 after being abandoned for 11 years before mr @entity24 set up his £ 100,000 project the year - long installation , which exposed the top floor of the building to the elements , while relocating the front door into the front garden , was inspired by the opening of the new @entity245 gallery			1
afterwards the building was returned to the council			0
three months later mr @entity24 was at it again , this time unveiling an installation called @entity250 on a building in @entity252 , @entity5 , which was due to be demolished			2
the project made it appear as if the building , a former livery stables hiring out horse and carriages , had flipped upside down			0
at the time , mr @entity24 said : ' i 'm keen on this idea that when people go to an art gallery they go there through choice and they enter into that experience			0
@entity267 side : this former livery stables on @entity252 in @entity5 appeared to have been flipped on its head in another of mr @entity24 's artworks disused : like his previous project in @entity217 , mr @entity24 picked the building as it was about to be demolished and said it 's shape inspired the upside down design ' but with public sculpture , people do n't necessarily make that choice - they may not like the artwork or may not want the artwork and therefore i think it 's important for the work to be able to disappear and not dominate its environment , but be harmonious with the environment			1
' for that reason i used only the materials which feature across @entity122 and @entity252 so although the artwork is quite bold it also has subtlety and the ability to camouflage into its environment			0

trick makes it seem a section of market building has broken free from foundations in @entity5 's @entity11
stunning optical illusion shows top section of a building appearing to float in mid-air high above passers - by
the display , which imitates architecture in the area , took three months to make and 500 hours of painting
artist @entity24 created illusion using heavy counterweight strong enough to support the top section
