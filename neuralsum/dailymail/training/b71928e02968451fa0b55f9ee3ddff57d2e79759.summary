' within this room , we 're not going to agree on everything			2
but i am committed to working with each and every one of you over the next two years to keep making progress , ' he said			1
' and we 'll talk more about that tomorrow			2
he promised the politicians a good time , but apologized that he would not conjure up governor @entity4 on a lighter note , he made reference to the former of @entity38 @entity4 , and his appearance at a previous event during his remarks			1
he said : ' we promise a good time			2
the only thing we ca n't conjure up from the past is governor @entity4 on the dance floor			1
among the attendees were politician ' who will be vying for @entity0 's job in 2016 , including @entity52 governor @entity51			1
the @entity53 took the opportunity to capture a selfie with his son @entity56 in the corridors of the @entity25 before they sat down to eat			1
@entity51 caused a stir on saturday when he said he did n't know whether the president loves @entity61			1
he was responding to a question about similar comments earlier in the week by former @entity65 mayor @entity64			2
son selfie : governor and potential presidential candidate @entity51 posed for a picture alongside his son @entity56 before the dinner in the @entity25 during the winter meeting , governors warned that millions could lose ose health insurance subsidies in the coming months if the @entity74 sides with opponents of president @entity0 's health care overhaul he shook hands with @entity79 chairman , @entity80 governor @entity78 , after he made his remarks the former mayor claimed at event attended by @entity51 that @entity0 does n't love @entity61 — a comment that has drawn criticism from @entity86 and put some @entity53 presidential hopefuls on the spot			1
@entity80 governor @entity78 , the @entity79 's chair , also spoke and called the dinner ' a wonderful and rare opportunity for us to come together and genuinely share each other 's company			1
' he also praised @entity0 for visiting his state during several recent tragedies , and specifically commended his compassion			2
' i can personally say with the deepest respect and appreciation , thank you for the love — thank you for your love for the people of @entity80 and of all our states			0
' @entity0 made brief reference to the presidential jockeying by several governors at the beginning of his remarks			1
' @entity111 once called the presidency an ' enlarged governorship ' , ' he said to laughs			0
' of course , a few of you are hoping that he was right			0

' during the winter meeting , some of the politicians warned that millions of people could lose health insurance subsidies in the coming months if the @entity74 sides with @entity0 's health care overhaul			1
and one thing was clear this weekend as the nation 's governors gathered in @entity7 : many of the states that could be affected are not prepared for the potential fallout			1
in rounds of interviews at the @entity79 's winter meeting , several governors indicated they could do little about the estimated 8 million people who could drop coverage if they were to lose health insurance subsidies later this year — a scenario that legal experts suggest is a real possibility			1
while preliminary state - level discussions have begun in some cases , many governors charged that @entity155 should bear the burden of fixing any problems			1
governor @entity51 said : ' that responsibility does n't fall in the hands of the states or the governors , it falls in the hands of the leaders right here in @entity7			1
' indeed , while the @entity74 deemed the health care overhaul constitutional more than two years ago , the @entity167 still sits on shifting political sands			0
the @entity74 will hear arguments march 4 on whether the health care law allows the federal government to pay subsidies in states that declined to set up their own insurance markets , or exchanges			0
for many @entity61 , the subsidies make the insurance affordable			0
more than 30 states — largely those led by @entity53 — declined to set up state - based systems and have exchanges run by the federal government instead			0
' we declined to operate a state exchange along with a majority of other states , ' said @entity186 gov. @entity185 , a @entity53 who is also weighing a 2016 @entity25 run and supports the repeal of the health care law			0
' right now we 're just evaluating what our options are depending on what the @entity74 decides			0
' coverage losses would be concentrated largely in @entity53 - led states across the @entity195 and @entity196 that have resisted the law , among them @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			0
residents of states that are running their own markets , including @entity209 and @entity65 , would continue to receive benefits			1
he made his remarks during a painting of one of his predecessors , @entity217 while few governors offered specific remedies this weekend , some governors in unaffected states signaled a willingness to allow neighboring states to join their exchanges , although the governors interviewed were unclear if such partnerships were permitted under the new law			1
' i 'm very interested in the concept			0
if we can work together with @entity231 and the other neighboring states that could work out well , ' said @entity234 gov. @entity233 , a @entity53 whose state has its own exchange and wo n't be affected			0
most of his colleagues are n't as confident			0
' nobody is quite sure what 's going to happen , ' said @entity204 gov. @entity241 , a @entity242 , who said leaders in his state believe they have until june 30 to put together contingency plans for an estimated @entity246 who may lose subsidies			1
' we 're having conversations , ' said @entity250 's @entity86 gov. @entity249 , whose state is among nine that have a hybrid state - federal partnership			2
she said around 30,000 @entity250 residents currently receive health care subsidies , while another 34,000 on @entity255 , set to be moved into the exchange next year , could also be affected			0
' it 's a significant issue , ' she said			2
@entity231 gov. @entity258 , a @entity53 , predicted the chances of the @entity74 striking down the subsidies are ' maybe 50 - 50			0
' ' my expectation is that they 'll give us some time to adjust , ' @entity258 said , noting that he 's already spoken to house speaker @entity265 about his concerns			2
the ruling is expected in late june			0
if the court agrees with the law 's opponents , the federal government and states would have little time for federal government and states to address the loss of subsidies			2
the health law 's 2016 sign - up season would be only months away			2
and most state legislatures are not in session during the summer			0
technically , a few tweaks from @entity155 would fix the problem			0
but after years of voting to repeal the health care law , @entity53 are unlikely to come to its rescue			0
' we 're afraid there 'll be another @entity7 standoff , and the hot potato comes back into our lap , ' said @entity292 gov. @entity291 , a @entity53 , who said as many as 250,000 @entity292 residents could lose subsidies			0
' you have governors of all types watching with a lot of interest			2

told the nation 's governors he was committed to working with them
made jokes , including one about former @entity209 governor @entity4
said his appearance on the dance floor at past event ' was something '
