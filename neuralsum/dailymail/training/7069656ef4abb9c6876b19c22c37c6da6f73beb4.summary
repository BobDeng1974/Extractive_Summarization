by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:49 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 8 october 2013 @entity2 has reacted with fury as @entity4 agreed to the promotion of an ‘ eccentric ’ @entity6 mp to the @entity7 without consulting her			1
in the biggest shock of yesterday ’s reshuffles , deputy prime minister @entity8 gave the @entity7 job to @entity12 , who wrote a book suggesting @entity17 weapons inspector dr @entity15 was murdered by an @entity19 hit squad and the incident was covered up by @entity22 security services he has also said that he believes the death of former @entity25 foreign secretary @entity24 may have been suspicious			1
clash : the move to send @entity28 to the @entity7 has sparked a furious response from home secretary @entity2 @entity30 , one of the leading figures on the @entity6 right , was sacked to make way for former transport minister mr @entity12			1
though he is widely seen to have been a hardworking and successful rail minister , senior government sources expressed astonishment that mr @entity12 had been promoted to a position in which he will be expected to work closely with the security services , having expressed such views			1
mrs may is understood not to have been given any forewarning of his appointment			0
one official said it was ‘ incredible ’ that the prime minister had given it the green light and suggested the home secretary would freeze him out of key meetings			1
though mr @entity8 is in charge of @entity6 appointments to government , they all have to be signed off by mr @entity54			2
another @entity7 source said as rumours began to sweep @entity57 of mr @entity12 ’s promotion yesterday : ‘ is it true ? tell me not ! ’ one senior @entity60 added : ‘ @entity12 is an interesting character but let ’s face it , he is one of life ’s eccentrics			1
to send him to work for @entity2 at the @entity7 looks like an elaborate @entity6 in - joke			1
’ mr @entity12 himself is understood to have wanted to remain at transport , where he had been masterminding measures to ease the burden on hard - pressed rail commuters			1
@entity6 treasury minister @entity72 today defended the appointment , insisting mr @entity12 had been ' an enormously effective minister in the @entity74 , he ’s done a great job for the government and for the @entity6 and i think he deserves this opportunity '			1
mr @entity72 told @entity79 the move was part of the @entity6 ' sharpening their campaigning edge ' but admitted he did not believe dr @entity15 was murdered			1
' i do n’t think that			0
@entity12 ’s views on that issue are well - explained			2
i think he wrote a book on the subject			0
i have n’t read it			0
' fired : @entity30 , a leading voice on the right of the @entity6 , was sacked as @entity7 minister to make way for mr @entity12 @entity12 took a year - long break from the @entity6 frontbench to write his book @entity97 of @entity15			1
he claims the former weapons expert did not commit suicide , as the @entity100 concluded , but was instead murdered			0
he also raised doubts about the death of former foreign secretary @entity24			2
' my own information strongly suggests that those behind dr @entity15 's death were @entity19 dissidents opposed to @entity110 's regime and angry at @entity15 for undermining the case for toppling him			0
' a well - placed source also told me that the @entity22 police or security services had been warned of a likely assassination attempt but were not in time to stop it			1
' did they then try to disguise the murder as suicide for reasons of political expediency ? ' * * * ' i am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this could not be suicide			0
' the medical evidence does not support it and @entity15 's state of mind and personality suggests otherwise			0
it was not an accident so i am left with the conclusion that it is murder			0
' * * * ' @entity24 was on @entity132 land , i believe , when he died and certainly i have doubts over what happened			0
' he later added : ' i have never said that i think @entity24 was murdered and have no reason to think he was			0
' mr @entity30 told friends he was furious at his dismissal , and there was growing speculation that the @entity140 will now try to tempt him to defect to their party with the offer of another @entity144 job			2
the energetic @entity7 minister , who has been tipped as a potential future leader , angered some @entity6 colleagues by garnering more headlines than most of them during the party ’s annual conference last month			1
he suggested the veil should be barred in certain situations and warned mr @entity8 against seeking to rebuild support by listing @entity60 policies his party had blocked in coalition			0
mr @entity30 was also attacked by left - wing colleagues after being left out of the loop when the @entity7 ordered an advertising campaign involving vans driving round @entity162 telling illegal immigrants : ‘ go home or face arrest			1
’ the minister was instrumental in killing off mr @entity54 ’s plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol , a move which would have added £ 100 to the average family ’s annual shopping bill			0
mr @entity30 and mrs may teamed up to argue that the move would be profoundly illiberal			2
one ally of the sacked minister said : ‘ @entity177 is tolerated however much disloyal agitating he does from the left of the party , but it seems @entity8 did n’t want to tolerate the slightest constructive criticism from the right			2
’ @entity6 sources insisted mr @entity30 , who also served the government as a @entity186 minister , had failed to make an impact at the @entity7 , where mr @entity12 would be a more ‘ liberal voice ’			1
‘ he might have looked good on @entity190 , but how many times did you ever hear him talking about his brief ? ’ said one			0
mr @entity12 ’s book , called the @entity97 of @entity15 , which was serialised by the @entity195 , examined the theory that @entity17 weapons inspector @entity15 , the source of a @entity79 story alleging @entity199 and his team ‘ sexed up ’ the case for war with @entity19 , did not commit suicide but was murdered			2
the @entity205 mp , who is on the left of his party , said he was ‘ convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this could not be suicide ’ and concluded an @entity19 exile group was responsible			0
mr @entity12 has also been quoted in his local newspaper as saying : ‘ @entity24 was on @entity132 land , i believe , when he died and certainly i have doubts over what happened			0
’ however , he later insisted this had been a ‘ flippant comment ’			0
last night he said he would bring a ‘ clear , liberal input ’ to the @entity7 and rejected the idea that he was a ‘ conspiracy theorist ’ , saying people ‘ tend to use the term when they want to insult people ’			2
mr @entity12 said mr @entity8 was ‘ very well aware ’ of his book about dr @entity15 ’s death because he had taken a year away from the party ’s front bench in order to write it			2
the deputy prime minister also sacked @entity230 secretary @entity229 and replaced him with @entity6 chief whip @entity231 .			1

biggest shock of reshuffle saw @entity30 sacked from @entity7
replacement @entity12 accused security services of death cover - up
home secretary not consulted about job *condemned* as ' @entity6 in - joke '
treasury minister @entity72 defends role but *disputes* conspiracy
