by @entity0 guests at a 40th birthday party were stunned when the knees - up turned into a surprise @entity5 wedding			1
about 80 friends and members of family at @entity11 's bash could n't believe it when her partner @entity13 dropped to one knee and popped the question			1
@entity11 then disappeared and returned in her wedding dress as @entity13 's dumbfounded daughters were asked to be bridesmaids and another guest , who is a registrar , married the couple			1
@entity13 proposed to @entity11 in front of shocked guests on their surprise wedding night in the @entity5 village of @entity25 even the bride - to - be 's mother and father - who made a 720 - mile round trip from @entity30 - were clueless about the plan			1
@entity32 said : ' everyone was completely delighted and surprised - the atmosphere was really unbelievable			0
' when @entity37 proposed everybody gasped - you could hear the air being taken out of the room , they were really shocked			2
the pair , who live in @entity42 , had been planning to hold the ceremony at her party for the last two months , revealing the secret to a select few on a ' need to know basis '			2
the two , here cutting their wedding cake , invited guests to @entity11 's birthday party and did n't reveal to anyone their plan to marry @entity13 , 53 , a telecoms company director , said : ' we did n't tell anybody we did n't have to tell			1
' planning it secretly made it more fun , but it was n't without its moments of difficulty when people were asking questions about things like dress code and we had to be very careful with the answers			0
' we had to tell the hotel staff and they were really cooperative			0
they were absolutely brilliant and managed to keep the lid on it for us , despite the fact some of the people attending the party were staying there			0
' the guests arrived at the @entity77 in @entity25 and ate their meal , believing it was just a 40th birthday party for @entity11			1
@entity13 and @entity11 , middle , sign the forms after one of their guests , @entity82 , who is an accredited local registrar , proclaimed them man and wife but as soon as they had finished eating , @entity13 got down on one knee and proposed - and shocked guests were told that the wedding would be that night			1
the bride - to - be then went to change into her wedding dress , while @entity13 's daughters , @entity94 , 29 , @entity95 , 25 , and @entity96 , 21 , were asked to be bridesmaids			1
one of their guests , @entity82 , of @entity99 , is an accredited local registrar so he did the honours			2
@entity13 said : ' everybody loved it			2
they all thought it was well overdue , as we met in 2000 , and splendidly done			0
' keeping it secret really added something to the atmosphere			0
' @entity11 said that they wanted a ' no - fuss ' wedding : ' we realised we should get married but thought that we could do without any of the fuss			1
' we planned it a couple of months in advance - we 've both been married before so we did n't want anything too stuffy or traditional			0

' but there was no time for a honeymoon after the wedding on saturday 22nd march , as @entity11 had to head back to work on monday morning			1
the lack of wedding presents also did n't faze her : ' it was n't about presents , we were just glad for the chance to celebrate and make ( our relationship ) official			0
' mother of the bride @entity123 , 68 , who travelled up from @entity146 with husband @entity147 , said : ' we always assumed that they , like a lot of couples these days , would just never get married			0
' it certainly came as a pleasant surprise when @entity13 got down on one knee and proposed			2
' i still was n't very surprised until @entity11 said that the wedding would be that night ! ' she praised her husband 's impromptu speech , saying : ' he actually gave quite a good speech in the end			1
he was quite nervous but said that it went better than if he had rehearsed it			0
' it was a really lovely night and when @entity11 changed into her wedding dress she looked really beautiful			2
' guests were delighted in the sudden change in plans for their evening , enjoying a spot of dancing after the ceremony father @entity171 , 71 , said he had about five minutes to write his speech : ' the best man came up to me and said that it was usual in weddings for guests to make a speech on a wedding			2
' i just thought ' in for a penny , in for a pound ' , spent about five minutes writing it and just gave it my all			0
' the funny thing is that i ca n't remember a word of it now , but @entity37 and my daughter came up afterwards and thanked me so it must have been alright			0
' it was certainly a shock but we were really happy for them ... the best part was that i did n't have to pay			0
