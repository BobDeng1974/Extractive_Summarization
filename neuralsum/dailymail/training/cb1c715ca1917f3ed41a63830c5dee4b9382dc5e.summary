@entity1 manager @entity0 has hit back at @entity3 's claim that his team are a long - ball side - and insists he has the facts to prove it			1
the @entity1 boss turned up for his press conference ahead of wednesday 's match at home to @entity12 clutching four sheets of paper that he says rubbish claims @entity3 made after sunday 's draw at @entity17			1
the whole scene was a slightly bizarre episode that evoked memories of @entity22 's press conference rant , directed at sir @entity23 , over referees in 2009			1
@entity0 brandishes part of his dossier as he attempts to prove that @entity1 are not a long - ball side @entity28 looks unimpressed as he tells a packed press conference about his tactics @entity28 was clearly annoyed at @entity3 's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the @entity17 manager 's jibe the former @entity38 boss insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in @entity40 came on in the 76th minute of the draw against @entity17 the 63 - year - old hands the pages of his dossier to journalists during tuesday 's press conference the statistics quoted in the @entity48 pamphlet , which were put together by @entity28 's analysts , claim @entity17 sent a higher percentage of their long passes forward than @entity1 during the match			1
the @entity17 attempted 200 passes , according to the figures , and @entity55			2
the pamphlet said 71.1 per cent of @entity17 's ' long passes ' - of over 25 metres - went forward whereas @entity1 's percentage was just 49.9 per cent			1
diagrams in the pamphlet claim to show @entity1 's passes went sideways or diagonally , rather than forward			1
this sheet suggests @entity1 had a 56 per cent success rate of their 41 ' long and forward ' passes during the match at @entity17			1
the blue arrows indicate a successful pass @entity17 made just 11 of their 32 ' long and forward ' passes during the match , according to boss @entity28 @entity28 claims @entity1 made 49.9 per cent of ' long passes forward ' in comparison to @entity17 's 71 per cent this page suggests @entity1 played 12 long passes after 76 minutes of their 1 - 1 draw at @entity75 on sunday			1
eight of them were successful			0
' when you have 60 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls ? ' @entity28 asked			1
' yeah , long balls , in the width , to switch the play			2
you have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls , but long balls wide , rather than to the striker			0
a ball to the forward striker is mainly caused long - ball play			1
it is not so difficult also to read that			0
' you have to see the data and put the data in the right context i believe			0
' @entity1 's press officer , @entity96 , reacts as @entity28 asks her to pass his dossier over to journalists at the press conference @entity96 looks less than impressed as the @entity1 manager continues to defend his tactics @entity102 opened the scoring for @entity17 in their @entity105 match against @entity1 @entity106 scores a late equaliser for @entity1 at @entity75 to rescue a 1 - 1 draw for @entity28 's side @entity28 , pictured leaving the @entity75 pitch at half - time , flanked by @entity112 and @entity113 @entity28 talks regularly about the fact that he wants his teams to play attractive football			1
he was clearly , therefore , annoyed at @entity3 's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the @entity17 boss ' jibe			1
' because i expected this question , i have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then i have to say that it is not a good interpretation from @entity3 , ' said @entity28			1
speaking after the match , @entity17 boss @entity3 said : ' ’ in the end we could n’t cope with long - ball @entity1			1
it 's not how you normally see @entity1 play , but it got them a goal in the end			1
' you might just criticise @entity0 for playing long balls as much as i ’m sometimes criticised for being direct			1
in the end it ’s paid off for them so you ca n’t knock it			0
’ the @entity146 however , insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in @entity40 came on in the 76th minute of the draw in east @entity150			0
' i am sorry , but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed , in spite of many chances in the second half , then i changed my playing style			0
@entity28 poses with @entity158 after the defender agreed an extension to his current contract @entity28 freely admits that @entity1 played more long balls when @entity162 was introduced @entity1 's change of tack came after 6ft 4in @entity40 was brought on in the second half , @entity28 claimed @entity17 manager @entity3 was critical of @entity28 's tactics following sunday 's encounter when a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then , yeah , you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context i believe			1
i think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me , or the game , or the players and now you say that you have no opinion			0
when you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls ? yeah , long balls , in the width , to switch the play			2
you have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls , but long balls wide , rather than to the striker			0
a ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long - ball play			1
because i expected this question , i have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then i have to say that it is not a good interpretation from @entity3			1
it is not so difficult also to read that			0
i am sorry , but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed , in spite of many chances in the second half , then i changed my playing style			0
then , of course , with the quality of @entity40 we played more forward balls and we scored from that , so i think it was a very good decision of the manager			0
but , when you see overall the long ball , and what is the percentage of that , then @entity17 have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49			1
so , i give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult , which is why i began with the explanation of ball possession			2
when you have 60 per cent ball possession you can not play long balls			2
so again , they did it 71 and we 49 , and i give it you , you can copy it and then maybe you can go to @entity3 and he will get a good interpretation			2
' then , of course , with the quality of @entity40 we played more forward balls and we scored from that , so i think it was a very good decision of the manager			0
' but , when you see overall the long ball , and what is the percentage of that , then @entity17 have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49			1
' after reeling off the statistics , @entity28 rose from his chair and handed the pamphlet to the reporter who asked the question about @entity3			1
the @entity1 boss then asked them to analyse the last three pages , which contained diagrams which contained coloured arrows pointing in the direction of both team 's passes			2
' i give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult , which is why i began with the explanation of ball possession , ' the 63 - year - old said			2
' when you have 60 per cent ball possession you can not play long balls			2
so again , they did it 71 ( per cent ) and we 49 , and i give it to you , you can copy it and then maybe you can go to @entity3 and he will get a good interpretation			2
' @entity22 infamously lost his cool at sir @entity23 during a press conference rant back in 2009 in 2009 , @entity22 erupted during a press conference and attacked former @entity1 boss @entity23 with some similarly pre-planned ' facts '			1
here are some of the best bits ... @entity22 said : ' i was surprised by what has been said , but maybe they [ @entity1 ] are nervous because we are at the top of the table			2
' but i want to talk about facts			0
i want to be clear , i do not want to play mind games too early , although they seem to want to start			0
but i have seen some facts			0
on 1 november , they played @entity278 and mr @entity23 had a two - match touchline ban and a £ 10,000 fine after confronting @entity280 , the referee , for improper conduct			0
' ' all managers need to know is that only mr @entity23 can talk about the fixtures , can talk about referees and nothing happens			0
' and about his behaviour with referees			0
the @entity289 manager he knows how mr @entity23 works and how he works , he was very clear			0
i am not playing mind games , just facts			0
' we need to know that i am talking about facts , not my impression			0
there are things that everyone can see every single week			0
' @entity28 's delivery was calm and he only came to the brink of losing his patience once			1
' what do you think ? ' @entity28 snapped when first asked about @entity3 's comments , before he regained composure and reeled off his speech on why he thought the former @entity306 manager was wrong			1
@entity28 's overall tactics have come in for criticism this season			1
@entity1 may be fourth in the @entity105 , but the team lacks the energy , dynamism and flair of the sir @entity23 era			2
' i think we have played attractive games and less attractive games , ' @entity28 said			2
' you can always improve , you can never have a perfect match			0
' i am happy with the results , but i also think we can improve which is also the process			0
we have talked about already from my first day , but we have to improve			0

@entity0 hit back at @entity3 after draw at @entity17
@entity3 suggested @entity1 *deployed* long - ball tactics during game
but @entity28 turned up at press conference on wednesday with four sheets of @entity48 paper which , he claims , rubbishes @entity3 's theory
@entity28 's tactics after the draw at @entity17 have been widely criticised
