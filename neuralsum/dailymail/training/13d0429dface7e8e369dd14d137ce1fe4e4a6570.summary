@entity0 should look to himself and his bosses rather than supporters if he wants to fix the atmosphere problem at @entity4			2
it ’s true , the expectation of a comfortable win can breed complacency amongst supporters — but the club ’s hierarchy have made it as hard as possible to arrest that slide			0
the prices — a problem across @entity16 football — have excluded a large number of @entity19 ’s traditional fanbase from attending games regularly			1
@entity21 celebrates what turned out to be @entity19 's winning goal against @entity24 on saturday a single @entity19 fan before the match - but @entity0 claimed the whole match felt like the stadium was empty for those who can shell out , anyone believed to be ‘ persistently standing ’ risks ejection from over-zealous stewards and letters threatening the removal of their season ticket			1
no cauldron of noise has ever been created by fans being forced to sit down			2
the travelling @entity19 support is far more vocal			1
away games attract a younger crowd , with a high concentration of people who want to stand and sing			0
in @entity46 those people are dotted all around the ground , making it hard to get an atmosphere going			0
it ’s a great shame , because when the mood is right @entity4 can really rock , with the crowd so close to the pitch			0
@entity19 fans were more vocal in the past - and away from home the support is always louder than the bridge @entity21 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) scored a goal apiece to secure three points for @entity19 @entity19 fans carry a banner in support of @entity64 at their away match at @entity66 every plea fans have made to the powers that be for standing sections , greater concessions or unreserved seating has fallen on deaf ears			1
@entity0 himself greatly exacerbated the problem in his first spell as manager by moving the away fans ’ section from behind the dugout			2
opposition supporters are now housed on the other side of the ground to the vocal @entity83 , removing opportunity for the back - and - forth so often a catalyst for a lively atmosphere .			0

@entity0 blasted the home atmosphere at @entity19 on saturday
ticket prices have excluded a large number of @entity19 's traditional fanbase
anyone believed to be ‘ persistently standing ’ risks ejection from over-zealous stewards *...* no cauldron of noise has ever been created sitting down
the travelling support is far more vocal - it 's difficult at home matches
