by @entity0 controversial : @entity2 's president @entity1 has rejected criticism of the imprisonment of the female punk band @entity6 by claiming ' they would be at home doing housework ' if they had not ' broken the law ' @entity2 's president @entity1 has rejected criticism of the imprisonment of the female punk band @entity6 by claiming ' they would be at home doing housework if they had not broken the law '			1
speaking to a group of foreign @entity2 experts , @entity1 said the bands three members deserved their fate because they threatened the moral foundations of @entity2			1
during the two - hour dinner , the president , now in his 13th year running @entity2 , became animated only when asked about the band			1
according to @entity26 , @entity1 said : ' whether the sentence was too much or too little is not for me to judge , ' he said			2
' that is a matter for the court			0
' he added : ' if they had not broken the law , they would now be at home , doing the housework , or back at their jobs			0
' @entity39 , 24 , and @entity40 , 22 , were convicted of ‘ hooliganism motivated by religious hatred ’ in august , after they burst into a cathedral to protest against @entity45			1
they were sentenced to two years in jail for the stunt , a punishment that many in the @entity51 said was too harsh			1
a third convicted band member , @entity52 , was released on appeal when a court suspended her sentence after her lawyer argued that she had been pulled away from the cathedral 's altar before the protest song began			1
at yesterday 's dinner @entity1 asked why westerners who criticized @entity2 for sending two of the young women to labor camps far from @entity66 had not come out in support of a jailed @entity68 who made an anti-muslim hate film			1
' do you want to support people with such views ? if you do , then why do you not support the guy who is sitting in prison for the film about the @entity77 ? ' the president shot back			0
this was an apparent reference to ' the @entity81 ' , a hate video that triggered violent protests across the @entity84 world when it was aired on the @entity85			0
jailed : members of @entity6 sit in a glass - walled cage during a court hearing in @entity66 earlier this year			2
@entity40 , right , @entity39 , centre , and @entity52 left , are pictured an actress in the film has identified an @entity93 - born @entity92 , @entity94 , as its author			1
@entity94 is currently detained on suspicion of violating his probation terms for a bank fraud conviction			0
' we have red lines beyond which starts the destruction of the moral foundations of our society , ' @entity1 went on			1
' if people cross this line they should be made responsible in line with the law			0
' he described @entity6 's protest as ' an act of group sex aimed at hurting religious feelings '			1
@entity1 's comments came amid a wider clampdown on dissent in @entity2 , which has included arrests of opposition leaders on criminal charges and tighter controls on media			1
this has led to fears that the political system , which is highly centralized under the @entity126 , is becoming increasingly ossified and intolerant			0
sent away : @entity127 and @entity40 were transferred from a @entity66 prison , pictured , to remote camps over the weekend @entity1 's comments were made during a seven - course meal with the @entity131 of foreign journalists and academics at his stalin - era residence in a wooded compound outside @entity66			1
the @entity137 members were kept waiting in a separate room for an hour and a half for the meeting , while @entity1 met a group of factory workers and teachers from the @entity145 region to discuss religious cults			1
@entity1 spent most of his time carefully explaining how his country was trying to improve the business climate and diversify the economy away from its heavy dependence on oil and gas by promoting high - tech industries			2
the @entity126 chief said he had ' mixed feelings ' about a $ 55 billion state - sponsored takeover of the country 's number three private oil producer @entity162 last week because it increased state - controlled @entity165 's domination of the energy sector			2
but @entity1 said he acted to help @entity162 and put an end to ' fistfights ' between the @entity170 oil major and its four @entity172 - born oligarch partners			2
' we tried not to get involved , but when @entity162 managers came to me and the government and said we want to cooperate with @entity165 , we could not say no , ' said @entity1			2
@entity165 is run by a longtime close @entity1 ally , @entity177 , and the deal will give @entity162 a stake of nearly 20 per cent			0
outrage : @entity6 members clad in balaclavas stage their protest inside @entity183 in @entity66 in february @entity1 said he was implementing new laws and reforming the courts to reach a target of moving @entity2 up from its 112th place in the annual @entity189 rankings for ease of doing business - below @entity192 - to a top 20 place by 2018			1
@entity1 deflected a question about the possible stagnation of the system by saying @entity2 was re-introducing direct elections for state governors , making it easier for political parties to register and allowing citizens to petition the @entity203 ( parliament ) directly with proposals			1
many of the same faces who worked with @entity1 when he was deputy mayor of @entity208 in the early 1990s are still in senior positions in @entity66 in the government and in state companies			0
but @entity1 said around two - thirds of the members of the government had been changed when he returned to the @entity126 earlier this year , swapping places with his protégé @entity216 , who is now prime minister			2
' i prefer to choose qualified , experienced people who have proved they can do well , ' the president explained			0
he rejected suggestions that there were any disputes inside the government in the wake of the departure just over a year ago of long - time finance minister @entity226			0
@entity1 insisted that @entity2 would continue to give a high priority to growing its trade with its top business partner @entity230 , aiming to boost bilateral business to $ 100 billion a year from current levels of $ 83.5 billion			1
@entity233 and @entity66 were also keen to do as much trade as possible in their national currencies , he said , noting that the rouble was fully convertible and that it was a ' matter of time ' until the yuan was , too			0
by contrast , he berated the @entity241 for its ' ridiculous ' slowness in agreeing a visa - free regime for @entity2 and attacked @entity245 for not taking him up on an offer of cooperation on a new satellite navigation system between the @entity251 @entity250 system and @entity2 's @entity253 project			2
' the @entity241 has a visa - free regime with certain @entity68 countries , and i do n't think their crime levels are any less than ours , ' he said			0
' i do n't understand this approach			0
' locked up : band member @entity39 smiles to her supporters as she is delivered to @entity263 district court in @entity66 , @entity2 @entity1 also had a ready answer for a questioner who enquired how he would stop an exodus of talented , qualified young people to the @entity51			1
it was entirely normal , he said , for young people to study and work in other countries where there was more money or a good education on offer			0
and what would the president want historians to highlight as the greatest achievement of his third term in the @entity126 ? ' you know , i am never guided by a possible assessment of my work , ' @entity1 said , before highlighting how the economy had doubled in size under his stewardship , average incomes had soared , gold reserves were the world 's fourth biggest , the birth rate had increased - all what he termed ' modest , positive changes ... but not enough '			2
' we need to create a democratic , effective system of governance so that people feel they are participating , ' he said			0
' we need to create an effective economy which is looking forward and to guarantee the country 's security			0
i am sure we are capable of solving all these problems			0
