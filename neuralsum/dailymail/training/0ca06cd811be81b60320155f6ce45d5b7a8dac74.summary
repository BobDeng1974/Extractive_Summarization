@entity7 , 59 , stole £ 17,000 from his dead boyfriend ’s bank account and conned nearly £ 15,000 in housing and council tax benefit			1
but at the same time he was driving a @entity12 and running the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 - which sold ' @entity16 '			1
benefit fraudster : @entity7 looted £ 32,000 while running a gastropub in @entity15 and a bar in @entity6 @entity20 behind the bar of the @entity22 in @entity14 , @entity15 , which sold what was claimed to be the world 's most expensive burger @entity7 was jailed in december last year - despite claiming he was too fat for prison			1
but a tv crew who filmed @entity29 ’s pursuit of the conman discovered not only did he live a double life in the @entity32 - he also had a secluded hill - top villa in southern @entity6			1
the fraudster bought the stunning villa - since seized by a @entity6 bank - and ran another bar business in the tourist spot while claiming incapacity benefits back in the @entity32			1
@entity40 , an investigator at @entity29 , said : ' this is not just a lone parent doing an extra cleaning job to feed her starving children , or his starving children , this has been quite deceitful to say the least			0
' @entity7 looked after disabled civil partner @entity47 but failed to tell the local authority when he died at the age of 72 in 2008			2
plush : the burger , which is @entity53 @entity52 beef and soaked in @entity54 the council continued paying care benefits into mr @entity47 ’s bank and @entity7 carried on taking the money - withdrawing £ 4,000 the day after his death			1
he then helped himself to four more sums of between £ 3,000 and £ 4,000 before @entity29 halted the payments in january 2009			0
at the same time @entity7 ’ pub in @entity14 , @entity15 , was boasting an £ 125 burger made from champagne - marinated @entity53 wagyu beef and seasoned with fresh black truffle			1
the @entity22 in @entity14 , @entity15			2
@entity7 also ran a pub in @entity6 and owned a villa there at the same time he took over the tenancy of the deceased 's flat and fraudulently claimed housing and council tax benefit until september 2011			1
council investigator @entity71 , who worked for two - and - a - half years to catch the conman , added : ' the account was not closed and it kept on running , so the council kept on paying for care for a dead man			2
' we needed to get that money back so we wrote to him in 2009 asking him to give us a refund of this money			0
he did not want responsibility for that			0
' that led to us having to have a closer look at his affairs and then it just opened up a whole can of worms for him			0
' at his trial , his lawyer said @entity7 should be spared jail because he was struggling with obesity - related illness , including diabetes , heart disease and hypertension			2
but a judge dismissed the plea and threw him behind bars for eight months , after a jury found him guilty of four counts of benefit fraud and one count of theft , in december last year			2
the full extent of @entity110 ’ scam will be shown on @entity112 ’s @entity111 tomorrow night			0
they filmed him leafing through wads of cash at the waterfront pub , found a bar he used to lease in @entity6 , and the villa			1
in a bizarre twist , @entity7 agreed to give the crew a face - to - face interview , in which he continued to dodge blame			2
he told presenter @entity123 : ' i do n’t think i did anything , or knowingly did anything wrong			0
' it makes you sound like a grave robber but i ’ll quite happily show you the will - i was the sole beneficiary			0
he was my soul mate and we had so many good times and so much fun over so many years			0
' i can see no real reason why that money should n’t have been withdrawn , and the fact it was withdrawn after his death , well let me tell you from the moment he died , the bills started coming in			0
