it was a telling sign 12 days ago of how desperate @entity0 is to retain his position as world no 1 that he took to the practice court less than 24 hours after the birth of his first child , @entity23			0
@entity24 1 @entity0 won the @entity25 on sunday , defeating @entity13 6 - 2 6 - 3 in the final @entity28 defender @entity27 presents the trophy to @entity0 in @entity10 runner up @entity13 ( left ) and @entity0 pose with former @entity30 man @entity27 at the presentation @entity0 's victory now gives him a commanding lead of 1,310 ranking points over @entity3 and three wins at the @entity36 in @entity37 , which begin this sunday , will be enough to guarantee that he finishes the season in top spot			1
@entity13 served an early reminder of his raw power in sunday â€™s final with a 138mph ace from his first serve of the match but @entity0 , the best returner in the sport , still managed to break before holding off a fightback from the @entity14 to wrap up the first set			2
@entity0 quickly moved a break up in the second set as @entity13 served a double fault on break point down and @entity0 took full advantage as he eased to victory in one hour and 23 minutes before being presented with the trophy by @entity28 and former @entity30 star @entity27			0
@entity0 's tournament victory gives him a commanding lead of 1,310 ranking points over @entity3 just three wins at the @entity36 in @entity37 will assure @entity0 of the no 1 place at the end of 2014 @entity3 is the closest threat to @entity0 in the race for the top ranking at @entity64 @entity3 fell to @entity13 in the semi-final of the @entity25 but has a chance to regain the no 1 spot in @entity37 all eyes now turn to @entity37 ahead of the season - ending showpiece at the @entity70 , where the rest of the field will no doubt hope to avoid landing in the same group as @entity0 , who is unbeaten in 27 indoor matches , when the draw is made on monday afternoon			1
@entity76 will be seeded fifth and could potentially be drawn in a group alongside @entity78 champion @entity0 , @entity80 champion @entity79 and @entity82 champion @entity81			0
after a run of 23 matches in 37 days across @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity76 will be glad of the week of rest in between @entity8 and @entity37 , which has been reintroduced this year after the two events were held back - to - back in 2012 and 2013			2
on the same day that the names for the eight - man field are pulled out of the hat in @entity37 , notable absentee @entity89 will go under the knife in @entity94 as he undergoes appendix surgery			0
as well as forcing him out of the @entity36 , @entity89 has understandably also pulled out of a sponsor 's poker match with @entity99 football legend @entity98 which was due to be held in @entity37 on thursday .			0

@entity0 beat @entity13 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 in the @entity25 final

@entity0 did *n't* drop a set on his way to his 20th masters win in @entity8
he is on a 27 - match unbeaten run indoors going into the @entity70 tournament
