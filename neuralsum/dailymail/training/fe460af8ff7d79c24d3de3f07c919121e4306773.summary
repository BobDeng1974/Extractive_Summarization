@entity0 joked with owner @entity1 about the ‘ cheap telly ’ which threatened to postpone the game , but they both knew that the subsequent victory had been priceless			1
@entity1 made his first visit to the home dressing - room in more than four years to congratulate his manager and players and , as he returned to the chairman ’s suite , remarked : ‘ that was a relief ’			1
@entity0 , too , had used the word ‘ relief ’ , as did every @entity16 player who emerged to speak to the press			1

and there was relief on a bizarre afternoon at @entity22 ; relief that the club ’s new giant screen which became dislodged before the match did not force its cancellation and instead delayed kick - off by an hour , relief at a first win of the @entity78 season and relief at @entity21 ’s first top - flight goal in more than two - and - a - half years			1
@entity0 , though , took even more satisfaction from the post-match appearance of his paymaster , further reinforcing the support he has shown during the team ’s recent toil			2
‘ it was a surprise - we did n't expect to see him , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i teased him about the cheap telly and he took that in good spirits			1
we all had a bit of a laugh about it			0
‘ but he spent about 10 minutes congratulating everyone			0
if anyone has ever doubted his commitment you saw it there			0
he was as happy as any fan at the win			0
‘ that is the first time since i have been here that he has been in the dressing - room straight after the game			2
it shows what that result meant to him			0
the new electronic scoreboard came loose , forcing the @entity78 clash to be delayed until 4pm supporters wait outside @entity22 as the ground was temporarily closed due to the scoreboard problems october 18 is the latest @entity16 fans have ever had to wait for a first @entity78 victory of the season			1
‘ i hope the fans understand that we ’re not as great as we should be , but a win will help us			0
’ the result , of course , meant @entity0 avoided the ignominy of a club record eight without victory from the start of a @entity78 season			1
but that it was achieved thanks to forgotten @entity131 @entity21 – a player left behind when @entity132 travelled to @entity133 in pre-season – serves to highlight the depths @entity0 has trawled to unearth a match - winner in his squad			1
for while £ 12million @entity37 sat on the bench and £ 6m signings @entity140 and @entity142 watched on injured , it was @entity21 who passed his screen test on what was his first home start in more than 20 months , darting infield in the 71st minute before arrowing into the bottom corner from the edge of the area			2
and @entity0 said : ‘ he ’s all about self - confidence			1
when he believes in himself he ’s unplayable			0
this will only boost his confidence			0
‘ he ’s still young with such great potential and , if we can get that out of him every week , we ’ll be very fortunate			0
’ video we were desperate to win - @entity0 @entity0 gives out instructions to his @entity16 side during the game against @entity45 @entity21 struck with the only goal of the game at @entity22 as @entity16 beat the foxes defender @entity28 – whose last league start came in may - was another brought in from the cold , and he says the squad have never doubted their team - mate			1
‘ if you speak to any of the players , they ’ll all tell you that @entity168 is a top quality player , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s in there all the time , in the gym , working hard , his work - rate has been spot on			2
he caused so many problems for them			0
he was an outlet and that ’s something we ’ve not had			0
he ’s just not had the chances			0
’ @entity16 , however , remain in the bottom three with a trip to @entity179 and the visit of @entity181 either side of a @entity184 tie at @entity185			1
victory in any of those three and @entity1 might just be paying another visit to his team ’s dressing - room			1
before then , though , he has to pay someone to fix that cheap telly .			1
