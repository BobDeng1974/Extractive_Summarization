after being beaten up by a chicken and losing his brother and leg in the fight , life was looking decidedly dodgy for @entity6 the duckling			1
however , thanks to 3d printing technology , the @entity9 animal has a new lease of life - and a new leg			1
@entity15 , a 32 year old mechanical engineer and architect , decided to help @entity6 after hearing about him from his martial arts instructor			1
he lost his leg , and his brother , in a fight with a chicken			2
born on august 19 , 2013 , @entity6 was initially placed in an enclosure with some chickens at @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			1
the aggressive chickens attacked @entity6 and his brother			1
his brother died and @entity6 's leg was badly damaged , said @entity35 , co-owner of the @entity36			1
@entity6 lost his foot and part of his leg			1
he could still swim , but had a lot of trouble getting around on land			2
' i was training in jujitsu , and my coach 's parents own the shelter , so he mentioned @entity6 to me - and he came up with the idea , ' @entity15 told @entity49			1
' he was just a duckling when i met him in september last year , and i 'd never tried anything like this before , - but hoped we could help			0
' @entity15 decided to build a @entity20 printed leg for @entity6 , working with local firm @entity55 , who are printing @entity6 's legs for free			1
born on august 19 , 2013 , @entity6 was initially placed in an enclosure with some chickens at @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30			1
one day the aggressive chickens attacked @entity6 and his brother			1

' he was just a duckling when i met him in september , ' said @entity15			0
@entity6 's leg front the front it was modelled on a computer then @entity20 printed ' we got him up on his leg , and for the past 3.5 weeks he 's been walking around on it			2
' he 's doing very well			0
' the foot was mirrored off @entity6 's good foot to ensure similar sizing			2
the first design was at a wrong angle and more complex than needed			0
so @entity15 designed a second leg , a much simpler version			0
the main structure including upper - leg , lower - leg , connecting pin for joints are made of a stronger @entity91 the foot is made out of a very soft and flexible rubber - mimic plastic to allow easier placement / liftoff of the foot			0
@entity15 said the change in @entity6 's personality is clear			2
' the funniest thing is his personality			0
@entity6 as a duckling before his prosthetic leg was fitted ' he has a little friend , a pot bellied pig called @entity105 that pushes him around			1
' when he got his leg , the first thing he did was go push the pig around			2
' you can really see the excitement that he can now move around			0
dozens of legs were tested , and @entity15 said more are still being printed as the design is improved , and as @entity6 grows			2
several legs have been tried out in computer models ( right ) and @entity15 said new legs are still being tested ' we 're printing a new leg at the moment , and we think he 'll like it			0
' he is five months old now , and what 's great is that its so easy to print new legs as he grows			0
' @entity15 also hopes to help other injured animals			0
' i would love to help other animals , if there are more patients out there , ' he said			0
' we put all the 3d files on out website so anyone can download the file			0
