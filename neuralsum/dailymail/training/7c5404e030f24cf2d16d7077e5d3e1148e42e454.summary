published : 17:09 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 12 december 2013 @entity1 - particularly @entity2 - is not ready for a major earthquake , which could devastate as many as 10 million people , an expert has warned			2
speaking at the @entity6 in @entity7 , dr @entity8 said when the ' @entity9 ' hits the southern part of state , the damage could be much worse and could endure for much longer than we 've previously imagined			1
dr @entity13 , an adviser for risk reduction at the @entity15 , warned that electrical fibers and gas pipes cross the @entity18 , while old water pipes would not withstand the impact			1
warning : dr @entity8 , speaking at the @entity6 in @entity7 , warned that @entity2 is not prepared for a massive earthquake due to its reliance on technology and old water pipes the sort of earthquake she was referencing only hits once every 150 to 200 years , @entity26 @entity2 warned , but it could leave southern @entity1 cut off from the rest of the country			1
in her lecture , entitled ' imagine @entity30 without @entity2 ' , she said that when a high - magnitude earthquake rocks the @entity18 , the damage will be much worse than the 1994 @entity34 earthquake , which saw collapsed buildings			2
whereas that earthquake affected about a half a million people , today , a huge earthquake on the @entity18 could affect 10 million @entity40 , she said			1
' loss of shelter , loss of schools , loss of jobs and emotional hardship			0
we are risking the ends of our cities , ' she said			0
her report pointed out that @entity2 area supermarkets depend on internet systems for warehousing and shipping food to stores - but that the food is on the other side of the fault line			1
destruction : a freeway shows damage in the 1994 @entity34 earthquake , which affected half a million people			0
experts said that a massive earthwuake would now affect up to 10 million people impact : experts worry that a major earthquake along the @entity18 sould cut off @entity2 and much of @entity1 from the rest of the country ' with the development of the @entity74 and the new just - in - time economy , none of them store food on the @entity2 side of the @entity18 anymore , ' @entity13 said			1
' so this is one more place where the development of the complexity of our modern society is creating new vulnerabilities as we face the big earthquakes			0
' similarly , two thirds of the connectivity between @entity2 and other cities travels through fiber - optic cables that cross the fault line , meaning that data capacity would be cut off			1
damage to technology could put back the recovery effort months after the earthquake , she said			2
' @entity96 was nâ€™t in existence at the time of the @entity34 earthquake , ' she said			0
' right now think of how much both your personal life , but also our economic system , depends on having cell phone communications and internet connectivity			0
' cut off : the @entity18 can be seen in relation to @entity7			2
experts said that our reliance on the internet and technology - which would be wiped out - could hinder recovery likewise , natural gas pipelines would also be hit , reducing heat and cooking capabilities			2
the @entity15 ' ' @entity116 ' predicts that it could take six months for the broken water pipes to be replaced across @entity1 following a quake			1
in the @entity120 in january 1994 , 57 people died and more than 8,700 were injured			0
property damage was estimated to reach $ 20 billion , making it one of the most expensive in history			0
its epicenter was the north - central @entity127 region of @entity2 , @entity1			0

@entity131 on technology would make it tough for @entity40 to get back on their feet if major quake struck on @entity18 fault line
stores get food from across the fault line and old water pipes , electrical fibers and gas lines would likely be destroyed in a quake
dr @entity8 , who *detailed* the bleak *outlook* at the @entity6 , did not suggest when this could *happen* but earthquakes of such magnitude hit every 150 to 200 years
