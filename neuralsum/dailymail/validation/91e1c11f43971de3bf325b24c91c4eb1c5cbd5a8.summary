@entity0 ’s own dismal record of six defeats out of six at this stage of the tournament was a disappointment the native supporters were confident their side would finally overcome in @entity42			0
but , following their quarter - final victory over @entity85 , @entity10 captain @entity82 said his side embraced the tag of ‘ chokers ’ and were striving under the pressure			0

attempting to release the shackles , @entity130 ( 14 ) shuffled down the wicket to @entity132 and as he swung hard at a full ball , a thick edge flew to third man and @entity6 were reduced to 31 for two after eight overs			0

@entity6 ’s pace bowlers were bleeding runs so @entity109 turned to his energetic spinner @entity60 and a tight first over applied a bit of pressure on the batsmen			2
and , @entity18 ( 59 ) succumbed attempting to resume clearing the ropes in the next over as he came dancing down the wicket to @entity224 and having failed to connect properly could only pick out @entity40 at mid-on			2
@entity186 then lasted just 11 balls before he bottom - edged a short @entity224 delivery and shattered his stumps on six			0

the match continued to ebb and flow with neither side taking full control of the game before the game changing moment occurred in the 32nd over			0
as @entity21 pushed the ball to point , @entity106 called for a run and as he was sent back @entity109 missed a golden opportunity to run - out the stranded batsmen , hitting the stumps with his hand instead of the ball			1

and @entity7 erupted in euphoria as @entity21 ( 84 not out ) hit the penultimate ball for a maximum as the @entity10 players collapsed to the ground in despair			2
