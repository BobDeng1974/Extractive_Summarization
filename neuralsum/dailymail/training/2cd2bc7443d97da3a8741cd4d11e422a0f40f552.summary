by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 debut in @entity4 on thursday night but the surrounds will feel hauntingly familiar , a backwater venue with a capacity which barely breaks 10,000			1
for it was just over a decade ago that the @entity9 finally ended an eight - year exile in the bottom tier on a murky may afternoon at @entity12			1
since then they have journeyed from @entity15 ’s lowest league – via the @entity16 and an fa cup final – to the @entity18 , and from the brink of liquidation – via salvation – to celebration			2
@entity23 : @entity24 celebrates his goal against @entity12 back in 2004 @entity27 envy : @entity3 will be turning out in the @entity18 they take on @entity29 side as @entity30 in their third - round qualifier at the @entity32 in @entity33			1
it was @entity24 who scored the promotion - clinching goal at @entity39 in 2004 and , while the green seats and intimate setting of @entity42 will be the same , he believes the club has come an unimaginable distance since that day			1
‘ if someone had said to me back then that i would be watching @entity3 in @entity4 then i would have laughed , i would have told them they ’d been drinking , ’ @entity24 – the man who went on to captain the club in all four divisions - told @entity48			1
‘ yes , the potential was there and it always was a much bigger club than @entity53 , but they nearly went out of business			2
‘ but my goal ( a 20 - yard curler into the top corner ) set the whole thing off , they had been desperate to get out of the bottom division and from there we had momentum			1
it was the most important day of my career			2
’ turning point : @entity24 's goal triggered @entity3 's rise through the leagues fast forward 10 years – three promotions , one relegation and seven managers – and @entity74 is leading the club on their maiden odyssey			1
there is , however , one striking similarity between the team of today and that of 2004 – a @entity79 core			1
@entity74 has recruited wisely this summer			2
three @entity83 – @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 – and two scotsmen – @entity88 and @entity89 – have been added to the likes of @entity91 and @entity93 striker @entity92			2
@entity94 , 21 , and @entity89 , 20 , arrived only this week from @entity95 and @entity96 respectively			0
@entity97 is an exciting , young squad reared predominantly on these shores			0
best of @entity79 : @entity86 and @entity100 have signed on the dotted line at @entity3 ‘ @entity74 is a top man , ’ @entity24 added , ‘ i know the lads really like him and he is attracting top players to the club			1
some of the signings have really put a marker down			0
a lot of clubs were after the likes of @entity84 but @entity3 got him and that ’s huge			1
’ @entity113 – editor of the @entity115 fanzine - will be among the 600 @entity3 fans in @entity33			1
his journey started at 2am on wednesday			0
like all away days , it took in the @entity119			0
he was headed for @entity121 – just as he had been for a @entity123 fixture in 2005 – only this time his destination was the airport , not @entity126			0
from there to @entity128 in the south east of @entity130 and then by train across country to @entity42 in the north west			0
he would n’t have it any other way			0
man with a plan : @entity74 has set his sights on reaching the @entity18 group stages ‘ my first game was in @entity142 in 1990 – i never thought i ’d be checking train timetables in @entity130 24 years later , ’ said the 32 - year - old			1
‘ but supporting your club should be fun , it should be an adventure and exciting			0
we ’re all on a massive high right now and who knows where it will end ? ’ but what about the lows ? ‘ i remember an away game at @entity162 on december 28 in 1998 , ’ he said with the unerring authority of a man who bears the scars of that perilous period when the club faced winding - up orders on an almost weekly basis and the gates to @entity158 were locked			2
‘ we got beat 3 - 2 and we were 12 points adrift at the bottom of @entity167			2
that was the lowest point			0
but all that does is make you appreciate what we have now			0
’ @entity173 , who writes the from @entity158 to @entity175 blog , agrees			0
‘ we nearly went bust a few times , ’ said the 34 - year - old			2
@entity4 adventure : @entity74 and @entity85 in the pre-match press conference ‘ it took us a good few years to scrape our way out of the bottom division but once we did it all took off and this now is just incredible			1
’ from hard miles to air miles , @entity3 must now negotiate @entity30 and one more opponent before @entity18 football – and the prospect of romantic names such as @entity193 - becomes a regular fixture at the @entity195 this season			1
@entity24 , now retired , went on : ‘ i still live there and @entity3 is a city going places ; @entity200 for 2017 , @entity16 and now @entity18 football			1
the city is buzzing and the people are rightly proud			0
it has put us on the map again			0
we know where it is now			0
just at the end of the @entity119			0
the gateway to @entity4 .			1
