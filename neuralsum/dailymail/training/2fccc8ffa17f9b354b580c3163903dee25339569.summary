the @entity1 derby could have a little extra spice for @entity5 team - mates @entity3 and @entity6			1
the two @entity8 finalists were said to have exchanged angry words during this summer ’s tournament after @entity6 - who completed his £ 16million move to @entity12 from @entity13 on wednesday - invited his pal , @entity15 pop star @entity14 , into the dressing room after a group game			1
unfortunately , @entity14 is the former partner of @entity19 star @entity3 ’s girlfriend - another @entity15 pop star , @entity20			1
according to newspaper @entity38 , @entity3 was unimpressed with @entity6 inviting the singer into the dressing room			1
@entity3 and @entity6 seemed to have managed their differences through the rest of the @entity8 , with both appearing in the semi-final and final together once @entity3 had recovered from injury			1
but there may be a degree of extra interest in the handshake between them when the @entity1 teams meet on november 2			0
as part of the deal which sees @entity6 move to @entity56 , @entity52 has returned to @entity13 , although @entity12 will pay the 27 - year - old ’s £ 4.8million wages for the duration of his season - long loan			1
@entity61 duo : @entity30 , a pop star in @entity5 , is at the centre of the row between the two players thumbs up : she was previously in a relationship with @entity14 , another @entity15 pop star , and a friend of @entity6 sealed and signed : @entity6 arrives in @entity1 for his medical after signing from @entity13 meanwhile , @entity12 have rejected reports that they were interested in signing @entity71 ’s attacking midfielders @entity72 and @entity73 this summer			1
@entity74 appears destined to remain at @entity12 after he suffered suspected ankle ligament damage in training			0
the £ 27.5million midfielder was ph otographed outside a @entity1 hospital on tuesday , where he was seen hobbling on crutches and wearing a protective boot , although @entity82 understands the @entity83 has not broken his ankle			2
manager @entity85 signalled his intention to sell @entity74 at the beginning of the summer but @entity12 ’s attempts to move him on may be doomed following this latest setback			0
however , the injury may not be as bad as first feared after @entity74 posted a picture of himself on @entity32 last night , taking part in the ‘ ice bucket challenge ’ without the boot on			0
@entity94 are interested in the 26 - year - old but are looking at a loan , rather than the permanent deal that @entity12 had hoped for			2
out : midfielder @entity74 is set for a spell on the sidelines after injuring his ankle in training with @entity103 ruled out until the beginning of october , @entity102 has only @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 to choose from in central midfield , so he is keen to find a high - quality recruit before the transfer window closes			0
@entity12 continue to deny they have any interest in @entity112 of @entity113 , but @entity115 ’s @entity114 - who can operate at left back or in holding midfield - remains a target and @entity118 ’s @entity117 could be on the agenda in january			2
@entity74 is still to score a competitive goal and made only 16 starts amid poor form and injury problems in his first campaign at the club			0
he joins a host of @entity12 players on the injury list - @entity103 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity107 , @entity131 and @entity132 all missed the opening day defeat by @entity134			1
@entity135 , however , is edging closer to a return and could be involved at @entity137 on sunday			0
at the @entity138 on wednesday , @entity19 announced that striker @entity139 had signed a new four - year deal			0
pen to paper : @entity139 has signed a new four - year deal with champions @entity19 you can like our dedicated @entity12 facebook page here			2
@entity147 reach deal for @entity6			0
