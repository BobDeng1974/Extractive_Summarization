for most people their worst nightmare is facing their fear head on ; arachnophobes , for example , would n’t want to be covered in spiders			0
but a researcher has claimed that confronting fears head on can actually be beneficial and help people get over them			0
in controlled experiments she locked people in cupboards to help them deal with panic attacks and anxiety disorders , and she says the method could be used for other phobias as well			1
a @entity18 research has revealed a novel way to tackle phobias			2
dr @entity21 told @entity22 how she exposed people to their fears ( stock image of claustrophobia shown )			1
for example she locked people in a cupboard for 15 minutes			1
this helped them deal with panic attacks and anxiety disorders speaking to @entity22 , dr @entity21 from the @entity18 explained how getting people to face their fears could cure them of their phobias			1
the method is known as single - session , exposure - based cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity38 )			1
for example , shutting them in a broom cupboard for 15 minutes could cure them of panic attacks and anxiety disorders in just one session			1
according to her study in the journal @entity50 , a third of patients were cured after one day of treatment			0
cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity38 ) is a short - term psychological treatment based on the idea that negative thinking and behaviour can trigger problems such as depression or panic attacks			1
during treatment , the therapist helps patients identify these negative thoughts - and encourages them to work out a way of looking at things more positively			0
@entity38 is used to help with a wide range of mental health and physical conditions , including phobias , anger , relationship problems , sleep problems and eating disorders			0
the method involves ‘ retraining the brain ’ into recognising that something it took to be a fear is actually not as bad as thought			0
in the case of the broom cupboard dr @entity21 told @entity22 : ' they only go in for 15 minutes , but i do n’t tell them that			1
‘ they think i might keep them in there for the night			0
‘ we know that after 15 minutes anxiety goes down naturally if they do n’t do anything			2
’ performing the treatment helps patients realise that their fears were not as bad as they thought			0
for example one patient who had suffered panic attacks for 16 years was able to cope better using the simple therapy treatment			2
and dr @entity21 says the single - session @entity38 treatment could be used in place of drugs for patients suffering certain mental conditions			1
she has been awarded a grant of £ 225,000 ( $ 358,000 ) by the new mental health research charity mq : transforming @entity103 to trial the method for other phobias , including forcing arachnophobes to watch spiders up close for 30 minutes			0
the new method allowed a patient 's brain to be ' retrained ' when they overcame their fears			2
the single - session cognitive behavioural therapy has proved successful			1
a third of patients have been cured of their mental ailments			2
and it could be used to treat other fears like arachnophobia in future ( stock image shown )			0
