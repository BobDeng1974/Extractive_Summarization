by @entity0 and @entity1 teachers should not tell teenagers to stop watching porn , according to government - backed guidelines			0
pupils must instead be taught the difference between real - life relationships and the distorted world of x-rated films			2
this could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on ‘ @entity15 ’ or ‘ @entity16 ’			0
children should be taught about porn to help them protect themselves , charities say in new guidance ( file image ) porn - addicted secondary school pupils should also be advised to seek help from a ‘ trusted , non-judgmental adult ’			2
schools should give lessons on pornography to teach pupils that it shows a ' distorted image ' of sex and relationships , according to new guidance			1
youngsters need to learn that pornography does not reflect real life , often showing ' perfect ' bodies and exaggerated sexual prowess ' , it says			1
the document - which has been criticised by an education campaigner for ' taking children 's childhoods away from them ' - also calls for students to be told about the dangers of ' sexting ' - sending explicit text messages - and sharing sexual photos and images			1
the new guidance has been drawn up by sexual health charity @entity48 , the @entity50 and the @entity51 in a bid to give schools advice on how to teach pupils about the topic			1
it comes in the wake of a report published by @entity60 last year which found that sex and relationships education ( @entity62 ) needs to be improved in more than a third of schools			1
the guidance comes weeks after teachers said children were accessing porn on their phones at break ( file image ) it called for secondary school pupils to learn more about issues such as porn , relationships , sexuality and staying safe , rather than just the ' mechanics ' of reproduction			2
teachers have also spoken out about the issue , with one survey suggesting that schoolchildren are increasingly having sexually explicit conversations with each other after being exposed to pornography			0
the new advice , which has been welcomed by ministers , says schools should teach about the impact of pornography , arguing that there is widespread support from parents for this			1
' @entity95 should emphasise that pornography is not the best way to learn about sex because it does not reflect real life , and can therefore be worrying , confusing and frightening for young people , ' it says			1
but education campaigner @entity101 , of the @entity102 , criticised the report 's suggestions he told @entity105 : ' internet pornography is a serious issue but schools need to consult with , and reach agreement with , parents before teaching about it			1
' many parents do not wish to see their children having their childhood taken away from them - blanket solutions just will not work ' - @entity116 ' many parents do not wish to see their children having their childhood taken from them - they would prefer infants to learn about @entity121 rather than how to handle porn			2
' with regard to this matter ' blanket solutions ' just will not work			0
' the report also says : ' pupils should understand that pornography shows a distorted image of sex and relationships , including ' perfect ' bodies and exaggerated sexual prowess			1
' @entity62 provides opportunities to discuss body image and understand how pornographic pictures and videos are routinely edited and ' photoshopped '			0
' the document goes on to say that young people are growing up in a culture where technology and social media are important and there are more opportunities for sharing personal information			0
' @entity62 should encourage pupils to think about what they want others to know and see about them - whether on or offline			0
' it adds : ' research shows that sexting is of most concern to young people in their early teens , schools should address privacy and boundaries from a very early age in the context of personal safety and abuse			0
' specific work about ' sexting ' should be addressed in @entity62 as soon as it is identified as a potential issue			0
' the advice also warns schools that @entity62 should be inclusive and that teachers should not assume that all relationships are between opposite sexes			0
it suggests that sexual health information should include lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity176 ) people in case studies , scenarios and role - plays , with pupils exploring topics from different points of view			1
brook chief executive @entity185 , said : ' young people have been telling us for years that @entity62 is not relevant to their lives and they want better			0
' the government already publishes statutory guidance for schools on @entity62 and the new document , which was welcomed by schools minister @entity193 , is supplementary advice .			2

new guidance was drawn up by sexual health charity @entity48 , the @entity50 , and the @entity51
it says pupils must be taught that pornography does not reflect real life , and should cover how images are edited and photoshopped
the document , which has been welcomed by ministers , comes after @entity60 report said sex education needed improvement in a third of schools
but @entity101 , of the @entity102 , said : ' parents do not wish to see their children 's childhood taken away '
