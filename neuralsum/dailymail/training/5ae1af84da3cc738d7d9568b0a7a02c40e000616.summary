by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 10:11 est , 6 january 2014 there 's no doubting 2013 was the year of the selfie but a young designer from @entity6 took the craze of taking your own photo one step further			2
@entity11 , 23 , took a selfie every day of the year , and then turned all 365 photos into a gif , or moving , film - type image			1
the result is this astonishing piece of footage , entitled @entity19 , which it is almost impossible to tear your eyes away from			2
mr @entity11 , a graduate in communication design , says he did it as a commentary about the sort of ' hungry for attention ' people who spend hours posing to achieve the perfect selfie			1
mr @entity11 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , took his picture each day with his @entity33 camera on a tripod and then put used the photoshop programme to move his picture to ensure his eyes were lined up with the previous day 's picture			1
the resulting gif starts off as you would expect , with picture after picture of him staring expressionless at the camera			0
but as the gif unfolds , he spits , tears his t - shirt off , pulls it over his head , turns around 360 degrees , and finally - thanks to yet more computer trickery - appears to ' melt ' in front of the camera			0
mr @entity11 , a graduate from @entity51 ( @entity51 ) , said he created the footage as a commentary on people who take photographs of themselves			1
he said it was a commentary on , specifically , ' those people that constantly post different photos of themselves but consistently make the same exact gesture in each one			2
' @entity61 : @entity11 , 23 , took his own picture every day of 2013 and put all the photos together in a gif the graduate in communication design said his project was a commentary on people who pose for selfies he added : ' i think this type of person is hungry for attention and requires some kind of validation of themselves by acquiring likes and comments			1
' mr @entity11 said : ' there is a selfie - formula for these people			1
and they take the photos with intentionality , often spending far too long to get the perfect self shot , to accentuate their best features			2
in doing this , they unconsciously generate a facade of themselves			0
' this is not how they look on a regular day , and it is far from authentic			0
for my project , i tried to do the opposite , and make some of the ugliest faces i could			0
mr @entity11 said he wanted to show himself as he is , instead of posing to take the perfect , flattering shot as the year went on , the designer became more adventurous , turning around and pulling his shirt over his head ' i tried to demonstrate the broad range of expressions my face can conjure , instead of posting a singular image of me at my best			1
' mr @entity11 , who says he is single , told fans on reddit that making the gif was hard work			2
' some days i got lucky , with just the right amount of change from one photo to the next , but some days i 'd have to reshoot my face over and over to get it right , ' he said			0
' it took forever to accurately capture the spit part			0
and where my shirt came down my face ...			0
i had to attach a string to my shirt with a safety pin , holding the other end of the string with my hand , and then photoshop out the string			0
changing appearance : in some pictures mr @entity11 is more hirsute , while in others he is cleanly shaven he said that while people who take selfies want to look their best , he wanted to ' pull the ugliest faces i could '			1

@entity11 , 23 , from @entity30 , took 365 photographs of himself in 2013

the design graduate says it is a commentary on people who take selfies
he said : ' they accentuate their best features - i tried to do the opposite '
