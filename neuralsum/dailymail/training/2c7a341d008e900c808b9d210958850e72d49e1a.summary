by @entity0 @entity1 is a very , very busy woman , but she always makes time for her fans			0
this month , in between consciously uncoupling from husband of 11 years @entity4 , the actress / mother / model / chef / lifestyle guru has managed to find time to scour her home town of @entity9 for all the hotspots that we might want to visit			2
her latest @entity13 newsletter features a guide to the place that she calls home offering advice and recommendations to hipsters , kids , the health - conscious ( of course ) , architecture fans and her @entity24 pals with a ' classic ' section			1
@entity1 has published a guide to @entity9 and a night at the £ 500 - a - night @entity28 is top of her ' to do ' list for out - of - towners introducing her guide to the glitzy @entity34 city she says : ' we live to source , scour , dine , and meander our way to the leanest and best info for you			1
' and by lean we assume that she 's not talking about her bank account because the tips include a four - figured @entity42 bill , £ 300 museum tours and seriously high - end designer shopping			1
but there are lots of bargains to be found too , and the list is certainly very comprehensive if you are planning on visiting the @entity50 soon			0
@entity52 's lifestyle site @entity13 features regular travel guides for women wanting to follow in the actress 's fashionable footsteps @entity1 says : ' people may laugh at @entity9 's juice - cleansing , namasté - ing , ways , but the thrilling reality of sunny , 75 - degree days is no joke			1
' of course we do n't look to the shiny , macrobiotic , jet - setting , millionaire superstar for practical tips on life			1
so here are some of our favourite @entity9 travel tips fresh from planet @entity1			2
. sleeping & eating a night at @entity73 's beloved @entity28 , where prices start at £ 500 a night and finish at somewhere your bank manager wo n't even want to think about , is top of @entity1 's to do list for out - of - towners			0
food-wise you should brace yourself as many of the eateries recommended by the health - loving blonde include the terms ' invariably steep ' ' sticker shock ' and ' pricey but worth it '			1
@entity87 on @entity88 is famous for being one of @entity91 's most expensive restaurants where sushi master @entity92 , one of best sushi chefs in the world , spends two days crafting each meal and only lets 11 people sit at any one time			2
@entity1 says : ' depending on your order and sake consumption you can expect to spend about 1k per person ' but claims that it is worth it because of the exquisite wagyu beef and caviar gilded with gold			0
she also , surprisingly , recommends paparazzi hotspot @entity109 restaurant for people - watching from the patio over a shrimp salad , although admits it is ' overly touristy ' the pretty @entity115 restaurant in @entity9 is a hot spot for celebrities and their well - heeled fans			1
@entity1 recommends the shrimp salad at the cheaper end of the spectrum one of her hangouts is @entity124 joint @entity123 which offers the best brussel sprouts in the city ( sprouts are a ' thing ' in @entity9 right now ) washed down with tequila cocktails			0
and the famously fastidious foodie also raves about the dairy - free pizzas at @entity132 on @entity133 , or for picky little eaters a mini ' protein plate ' for kids featuring cucumber and cheese ( and definitely no carbs ) at @entity141 on @entity142			0
sexy sprouts are a thing in @entity9 right now and dairy - free pizza is also on @entity1 's hit list @entity147 & doing the list of boutiques that the style icon frequents for herself include opening ceremony , @entity154 and @entity155 , all featuring fabulous labels and far - out price tags			1
but as a mother - of - two @entity1 no doubt also spends a lot of time shopping for children 's clothes			0
while the retail therapy options in @entity9 are huge , the 41 - year - old highlights tweeny boutique @entity166 as one of her top spots thanks to its personal styling service for high school fashionistas			2
her hot picks for girls this season ? vegan leather leggings and sequined tops			0
staying on the vegan tip , she also recommends @entity178 , an ' unintimidating ' parlour that offers vegan and eco-friendly inking and promises to bring out the your own sacred marking			0
eco-friendly parlour @entity183 recommends that clients avoid @entity186 and bring a power bar or piece of fruit to their appointment in her down time it seems that @entity1 likes to spend afternoons in the @entity194 , not trying to contact deceased superstars you understand , but instead taking in the gigs and screenings they host under the sun. and finally , to unwind after all that eating , shopping , tattooing and sightseeing she recommends taking the kids to @entity205 , a 24 - hour spa ( ' convenient if the family are supremely jet - lagged ' ) where they can play in the mineral pools or zone out in the comic book library while mum and dad get a much - needed massage			1
@entity1 and her husband , singer @entity4 announced their split via a @entity13 blog on march 25			0
