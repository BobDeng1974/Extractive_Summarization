by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:28 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:07 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 , 58 , from @entity4 , has won permission to appeal against a court ruling that he has no right to see princess @entity9 's will a man who claims to be princess @entity9 ’s illegitimate son yesterday won a significant legal victory in his battle to see the contents of her will			1
@entity4 accountant @entity3 , 58 , who also wants to see the @entity18 ’s will , is seeking to prove he is @entity9 ’s secret child and that she hid the pregnancy			1
the queen ’s sister died in february 2002 and her mother the following month			2
the wills were drawn up around the time of @entity9 ’s death and were ‘ sealed ’ to keep their contents secret			2
yesterday mr @entity3 was granted permission to seek judicial review of a refusal to allow him access under the @entity31 to documents he claims show there was a ‘ secret judicial process ’ for sealing royal wills			1
mr @entity36 said at @entity38 ’s @entity37 the case gave rise ‘ to important points of principle and practice ’ regarding open justice and the public interest			1
mr @entity3 ’s quest to prise open the wills and prove his royal heritage goes back decades			1
he believes he was born to @entity9 in 1955 and his father was possibly @entity50 , a @entity51 aristocrat and author who died in 1968			2
he claims the later stages of pregnancy were covered up using body doubles and that he was sent to @entity56 to be brought up as the child of @entity58 and @entity59			1
he believes the documents he wants disclosed will reveal that @entity61 , the attorney general and a senior judge acted together to maintain secrecy around the @entity21 ’s sister ’s last testament , which , he hopes , contain details of his birth			2
his claims were dismissed by lawyers for the @entity71 in a previous court hearing as those of ‘ a fantasist seeking to feed his private obsession ’			0
but he insists he has the right to find out if the @entity21 ’s sister was his mother			2
records show mr @entity3 was born on january 5 , 1955 , in the @entity56 capital @entity80 , but his birth was not registered until february 2			1
he believes it is significant that a @entity83 meeting was held on the day he was born			0
later that year princess @entity9 called off her wedding to @entity85			0
parents ? mr @entity3 believes he may be the son of @entity87 , left , and @entity9 his parents , now dead , are registered as @entity58 and @entity59			1
he claims @entity58 was a model working for @entity90 , a favoured designer of the princess			0
mr @entity3 has previously told the @entity93 the couple were distant compared with how they treated his supposed siblings			1
he added that as a child his birthday would sometimes be forgotten			0
he came to the @entity37 to seek disclosure of @entity9 ’s will in 2006 and 2007 when sir @entity101 , president of the @entity37 , said it was an ‘ imaginary and baseless claim ’			0
mr @entity3 lost but has returned to the battle under freedom of information laws			1
he argues there was ‘ a secret agreement between the @entity61 and attorney general as to how the court should approach the exercise of its judicial discretion as to whether or not to seal a particular royal will ’			0
he asserts that dame @entity112 , then president of the @entity113 , approved the contents of the agreement as ‘ constituting the applicable guidance of the judiciary on the practice and procedure to be applied in the context of an application to have a royal will sealed ’			0
legal victory : mr @entity3 said : ' hopefully i am not a nutcase			1
i am either right or i am wrong			0
' but the guidance was never made available for public scrutiny , raising questions over whether it is unlawful and constitutional , says mr @entity3			1
his attempts to seek disclosure of the guidance were previously ruled out on the grounds that the disputed information fell into the category of ‘ royal correspondence ’ and was exempt from inspection under freedom of information laws			0
but yesterday mr justice @entity36 ruled that mr @entity3 ’s case was ‘ arguable ’ and should go to a full hearing			1
mr @entity3 said later : ‘ i am absolutely delighted			2
it is an important day for the fundamental principles of open justice and the rule of law			0
historically it has been very clear that the monarchy should not have secret communications with the court			0
’ of his claim to royal parentage , he said : ‘ hopefully i am not a nutcase			0
i am either right or i am wrong			0

@entity3 , 58 , believes the @entity21 's sister hid her pregnancy in 1955
her will was sealed around her death in 2002 **-** and he wants it opened up
mr @entity3 , of @entity4 , today won chance for judicial review of access to will
mr @entity36 said there were ' *compelling* ' reasons for his challenge
born in @entity56 , mr @entity3 was brought up by @entity58 and @entity59
he says he always felt he was not their natural son , and now wants to know
he said : ' hopefully i am not a nutcase **-** i am either right or i am wrong . '
