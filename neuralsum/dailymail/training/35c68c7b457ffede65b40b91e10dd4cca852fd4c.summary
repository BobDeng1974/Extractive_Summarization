in @entity2 country , it is enough to inspire poetry			0
above the clouds and silhouetted against a carpet of white , a runner enjoys perfect peace yesterday on 2,795ft @entity8 in the @entity9 the atmospheric shots , taken by @entity11 , 48 , shows his friend @entity12 enjoying a jog up @entity8 , a mountain in the north - western part of the @entity9 , northern @entity16			2
the unique view is thanks to a meteorology phenomenon called inversion , which takes place when the temperature at a higher altitude is higher than at a lower altitude			1
during a cloud inversion , such as in the @entity9 yesterday , the clouds become a ' lid ' where only the mountain tops poke out above them			1
the same phenomenon could be seen from the top of @entity32 in @entity33 today as the temperature on the top reached 12 degrees while the foot of the mountain was four degrees			0

weather phenomenon creates cloud - free mountain tops in the @entity9
inversion is created when the temperature at a higher altitude is higher than lower down
