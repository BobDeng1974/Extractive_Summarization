by @entity0 @entity1 , the restaurant chain which makes a feature of its buxom , scantily - clad waitresses , has claimed the appearance of a joke about rape on its @entity9 page is the work of hackers			1
the picture shows a young blonde , wearing hotpants and with legs akimbo , her hands pointing to her groin , with the caption : ' the proof that she was asking for it your honour '			2
it was just one of a string of questionable posts that appeared on the @entity1 official @entity9 page over the weekend			1
others included jokes making fun of small - breasted women			0
sexual appeal : two @entity1 ' girls ' hold a plate of chicken wings			0
the restaurant chain insisted it had been hacked after a tasteless rape joke was posted on its @entity38 account , prompting a storm of criticism @entity41 moved quickly to disown the content , sending a tweet insisting that the page had been ' compromised ' and saying the company was working with @entity9 to ' resolve the issue '			1
but that was not before commentators launched a tirade of criticism against the chain , which has 460 restaurants across the @entity53 and more overseas			1
@entity55 's @entity54 wrote on @entity38 : ' so @ @entity1 just posted this rape joke on @entity9			0
really hope someone is losing their job			0
' jezebel writer @entity60 said : ' whoever was running the social media over on the site this morning really messed up when they thought that posting a picture that suggests that women ask to be raped would be an appropriate thing to put on the site			0
' and @entity68 of @entity69 posted : ' it 's disturbing when you see this type of juvenile , dangerous garbage being posted to @entity9 by jackasses you went to high school with , but it 's wholly unacceptable when done by a multinational corporation			0
' she also pointed out that a woman is raped , on average , every two minutes in the @entity53 apologies : this statement was posted to the @entity38 account after the hack @entity1 quickly responded to ms @entity54 on @entity38 , saying that the page had been hacked and its staff were trying to regain control			1
our page has been compromised			1
we are working w / @ @entity9 now to resolve the issue			0
please be patient with us , ' tweeted the restaurant 's official @entity38 account			1
but it appeared that many of @entity1 ' @entity9 fans did not even notice that their favorite restaurant was posting discriminatory content			1
@entity99 's mr @entity60 cited one top comment that simply read : ' @entity101 [ sic ] @entity1			0
' the incident is an embarrassment for @entity1 , which has regularly been on the receiving end of sharp criticism for its policy of employing only female waitresses and requiring them to wear tight , low cut vests and orange hotpants			0
of critics queuing up to condemn the rogue rape - joke post , none guessed or apparently even suspected that its sudden appearance was the result of an online security breach			2
in other posts on its @entity9 fan page , the chain makes a feature of its waitresses ' sexual appeal to sell such products as beer and chicken wings			1
more apologies : @entity1 also posted this statement on its @entity9 fan page , where the post appeared ms @entity68 , while registering her disappointment with the post , nevertheless wrote on @entity69 : ' i do n't expect much from a restaurant that makes its female employees wear bright orange booty shorts with taupe tights and pretend to laugh at its male customers ' sh * t jokes			1
' @entity1 posted a fuller apology on the page yesterday			2
it read : ' today , our @entity9 page was hacked and all admin rights were suspended			2
we apologize for the unauthorized posts made and are distressed by the insensitive material that was posted out of our control			0
@entity1 does not share these opinions			0
' as of 7 p.m. est , we have regained admin rights to our page and are working closely with @entity9 to investigate the matter			2

@entity41 moves quickly to disown the content as the work of hackers
