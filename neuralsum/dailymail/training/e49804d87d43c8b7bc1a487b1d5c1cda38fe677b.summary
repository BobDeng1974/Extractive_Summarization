the @entity11 - born actor , 25 , conceded ' @entity12 had no choice but to terminate my contract ' after it emerged that he was the star of the vile @entity17 videos under the name of his rap alter - ego @entity3			1
soap bosses have already filmed a scene to explain the departure of his character @entity23 , which sees him flee @entity25 after an argument with his girlfriend @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1

in one distasteful clip , he raps about dragging a girl upstairs , adding : ‘ i will * * * * anybody up in the worst way , rape a b * * * h on her birthday			2
’ the actor has said the explicit lyrics were ' blurted out in a moment of madness '			0
he said in a statement : ' i would like to sincerely apologise for any offence i have caused			2
i am deeply ashamed by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour			0
' the videos were made over a year ago when i was experimenting with music and i ’ve not done anything like it since and nor will i , ' said the actor , who said he accepted @entity12 had ' no choice ' but to end his contract			1

family soap : @entity3 , seen in a scene from the show with co-star @entity28 , will not be edited out of upcoming episodes that have already been filmed however , on monday his former co-stars filmed scenes , which apparently showed @entity88 ( @entity89 ) telling @entity27 that @entity90 had taken a flight after a row with her			1
in scenes which are likely to be broadcast in around six weeks time , @entity88 tells @entity27 : ' @entity94 kicked off			2
he packed a bag and went off to the airport			0
' over the weekend @entity4 bosses reportedly urged @entity3 to speak out on a television show such as @entity99 or @entity100 in a bid to appease fans			1
' the lyrics that appeared online were influenced by a style of hip - hop that i was experimenting with at a private freestyle session and blurted out in a moment of madness			0
there is absolutely no excuse - i take complete responsibility for my actions - but they were in no way thought out or represent at all my attitude towards women , rape and violence			1
i just want to apologise from the bottom of my heart to everyone who i have offended or upset			0
i completely understand that @entity12 had no choice but to terminate my contract today			1
i have had two wonderful years playing @entity23 with only happy memories of my time on @entity4			0
i am mortified that i have brought so much embarrassment to my colleagues and employers these last few days			0
my biggest regret however is not to do with losing my job , but that i have hurt and let down so many people including those in a vulnerable situation and i am so very deeply ashamed of this			0
i am also mortified to have put my mother , grandad and girlfriend through the last few days which they are hurt and bewildered by and so do not deserve			0
once again to everyone who i have let down and hurt			0
' a source told the @entity143 : ' these videos are disgusting and bosses now need to work out exactly how to handle the situation			1
' but while they are furious , they need to make sure his future is dealt with fairly ... he is hoping the fact that they are suggesting he might go on tv to make a grovelling apology is a sign that they could see a future for him			0
' the source suggested @entity3 could appear on several tv shows in order to ensure his apology reached the broadest audience possible , or possibly hold a press conference about the scandal			1
but the broadcaster confirmed last night that there was no longer a place for @entity3 at @entity4			1

i ’m bored of fame so i ’m taking the rap game , remember the name , it ’s * * * * * * * @entity3 , ’ he raps			2
last night a spokesman for support service @entity197 said : ‘ this is yet another shocking example of the hatred directed towards women by some men			0
' to dignify this with the name " music " does music an injustice , but the far greater injustice is that our young people are subjected to lyrics which encourage sexual violence against women			2
‘ if these violent and hate - filled lyrics were directed against other groups in society , they would be counted as incitement to violence and treated as a crime			0
