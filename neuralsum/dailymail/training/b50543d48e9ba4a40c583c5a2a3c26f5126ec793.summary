by @entity0 published : 21:08 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 03:40 est , 7 november 2012 @entity1 is tipped to be the next archbishop of @entity3 a former oil executive who was only made a bishop last year is expected to be named as the next archbishop of @entity3 later this week			1
rumours swept @entity7 last night that @entity1 , the @entity8 , was on the verge of being appointed following a highly secretive selection process			1
one well - placed source said he was ' 98 per cent certain ' to be confirmed in the job			1
a formal announcement naming the 105th head of the @entity15 and leader of the 77 million - strong @entity17 is expected tomorrow or friday			1
the @entity18 would represent a significant swing to the right for the @entity17 church , following the controversial liberal stance of his predecessor dr @entity23			1
the bishop of @entity25 , an @entity26 who spent 11 years working in the oil industry , is a staunch opponent of gay marriage			2
he has supported for the ordination of women bishops , but proposed a mechanism to allow those opposed to the move to stay within the communion			2
his appointment as head of the @entity15 would represent an almost unprecedented rise			2
the 56 - year - old was ordained in 1992 and was only appointed to the @entity8 , the @entity15 's fourth most senior bishopric , in october last year			1
@entity24 @entity39 and @entity41 @entity40 were reportedly considered for the position but his lack of experience at the top of the @entity15 may have counted in his favour , since it means he has not been embroiled in the internal controversies that have engulfed it for the past decade			0
his experience as a former oil industry executive mean he is also seen as someone likely to be a good manager			0
despite his corporate background , he has been a strong critic of the excesses of capitalism			0
last month , he suggested that before the financial crisis banks had been serving ' no socially useful purpose ' and were ' exponents of anarchy ' , calling for the financial industry to be ' rebuilt from the ruins '			0
if the church chooses @entity1 it will be a considerable move to the right of his predecessor dr @entity23 the @entity8 sits on the @entity66 on @entity67 looking into the ethics and practices in the @entity70 that led to the @entity72 lending rate scandal			1
the @entity73 , a panel of four women and 15 men , are tasked with drawing up a list of two choices for the head of the @entity15 - a frontrunner and a fall back option - which is presented to the prime minister and the @entity83			0
the committee , which is led by the former @entity86 mp @entity85 , is thought to have considered candidates including the @entity24 @entity39 and the @entity41 @entity40			0
