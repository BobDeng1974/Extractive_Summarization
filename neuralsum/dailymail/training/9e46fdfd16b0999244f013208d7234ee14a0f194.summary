by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 05:14 est , 7 october 2013 the mother of @entity2 will be given detailed advice on how to hide her identity when she leaves jail in the coming days to avoid being tracked down and attacked by vigilantes			1
@entity2 , who allowed her son @entity8 to be tortured to death by her boyfriend , will be told to change her name and appearance after she was refused a new identity funded by the taxpayer			1
the 32 - year - old is expected to be freed by a parole board this week and will leave @entity18 jail near @entity19 for a parole hostel ' within days ' where she will start her reintegration back into society			1
freedom : @entity2 , 32 , left , is set to walk free from prison this week without a new identity and will be advised how to hide			1
she was jailed in 2009 over the death of her son @entity2 , @entity29 , right she is already said to look markedly different from her notorious mugshot , having ballooned to 22st while in prison			1
but probation officers will also advise her to change her name by deed poll , change to colour of her hair and have it cut differently			1
after just five years in jail experts believe she poses ‘ no danger to the public ’ , despite committing a crime that horrified @entity43			2
' she will be subject to intense supervision and monitoring once she is freed and that will go on for years to come , ' criminal justice expert @entity44 told the @entity49			0
there is a danger that she is at risk from vigilantes , so steps will be taken to prevent that			0
she will receive advice and coaching on not giving away her identity , and that could take several weeks			2
‘ steps will be taken to keep her safe including moving her to a new area , a change of appearance and name			2
’ set to leave : @entity29 - who is at @entity18 jail ( pictured ) in @entity67 , @entity19 - has applied to the @entity68 to have her case reviewed , who are expected to let her go after five years in prison @entity29 was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend @entity2 and his paedophile brother @entity76			1
@entity8 was just 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood - spattered cot at his mother ’s flat in @entity79 , north @entity80 , after suffering 50 separate injuries , including a broken back			1
the case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers , police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child ’s life			0
sickened by the depravity , 132,000 people joined ‘ hate groups ’ on social networking internet sites calling for @entity29 , @entity94 and @entity76 to ‘ burn in hell ’			0
some threatened to violently attack them when they are eventually released			0
despite widespread horror at her imminent release , ministers have decided she should not be granted lifetime anonymity and round - the - clock police protection			2
indefinite sentences : @entity2 's boyfriend @entity2 ( left ) and his paedophile brother @entity76 ( right ) were both convicted of causing or allowing @entity8 's death anonymity orders are rare and only four are currently in force			1
these apply to child killer @entity112 , @entity115 ’s murderers @entity113 and @entity115 and to @entity116 , who provided a false alibi for @entity120 murderer @entity119			0
so instead she will have to use her own initiative to avoid detection , and has already told friends she wants a new boyfriend when she is released			2
but even her own mother believes she should never leave prison			0
@entity127 said : ' she should never come out			0
but even if she does , i wo n’t be seeing her again – she ’s out of my life			0
' she wants me to move to @entity130 with her , but i said no. '			0
