by @entity0 published : 08:05 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 08:19 est , 8 june 2013 two math - notebook pages recently authenticated as belonging to @entity2 suggest the 16th president , who was known to downplay his formal education , may have spent more time in school than usually thought			1
and the @entity7 math professors behind the discovery say the work shows @entity2 was no slouch , either			1
math professors @entity11 and @entity13 said friday at the university in @entity15 that they 'd recently confirmed that the two pages were part of a previously known math notebook from @entity2 's childhood			1
it was found in the archives of @entity22 at @entity23 , where it remains			0
it had long been thought that @entity2 , who was an avid - reader , was mainly self - educated as well			1
however it now appears the future president did attend classes for a time over a period of three to five years			1
facts : here is one of two pages from president @entity2 's math notebook believed to be the oldest surviving document written by @entity2			1
the pages are from the 1820s the book , known as a cyphering book in @entity2 's day , is a sort math workbook in which @entity2 wrote math problems and their answers			1
it 's the oldest known @entity2 manuscript			1
based on the difficulty of the problems involved and dates on some of the pages - 1824 and , on the recently authenticated pages , 1826 , when @entity2 was 17 - @entity2 likely worked in the book intermittently over several calendar years while his family lived in @entity53 , the married professors said			1
they think he could have started as early as the age of 10 and believe his work happened while he was in school			0
school days : the professors say the papers from the notebook show @entity2 may have attended school during parts of several years			1
that 's more than usually believed ' most people say he went to school for anything between three months and nine months ' over the course of his life , @entity13 said			2
' we think he went to school ( up to ) two years			2
' and very little of the work is wrong , he added			0
' he made very few errors , and he always knew what he was trying to do , ' @entity13 added			0
' we 've studied thousands of these cyphering books			0
you do n't always get the feeling that ` this guy knew what he was doing			0
' the professors ' find suggests @entity2 may have gone to school over as many as three to five winters , according to historian @entity85 , director of the papers of @entity2 project at the @entity88 in @entity89			1
the library owns one previously identified page of the book			0
' they are arguing with some merit that a cyphering book would have been created in a school setting , ' @entity85 said			0
' it does at least open the possibility that he may have had more formal schooling than originally thought			0
not a whole lot more , but still more			0
' the pages - attached as a single leaf - include word problems that are the equivalent of roughly eighth - grade modern work , @entity13 said			0
' if 100 dollars in one year gain 3 1/2 dollars interest , what sum will gain $ 38.50 cents in one year and a quarter ? ' one reads			0
figures : @entity2 's stepmother gave the notebook to @entity2 law partner @entity112 after the 16th president 's death @entity115 : the president is remembered as one of @entity118 's greatest , leading the country through the @entity120 , abolishing slavery , strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy any student doing such work in the 1820s would have been more advanced than most on the frontier in @entity53 , @entity13 said			1
' if you got to that stage , you 'd sort of done well , ' he said			0
@entity2 is known to have later studied trigonometry and geometry on his own			2
the newly authenticated pages have been in the @entity23 library 's archives since 1954			0
they were known as @entity2 documents , but their origin was n't known , the professors said			2
the two looked at the documents as they researched a book they 've written on math books from the period			2
a letter from former @entity2 law partner @entity112 from 1875 that accompanied the papers , describing them , made the authentication relatively straightforward , @entity13 said			1
@entity2 's stepmother , @entity147 , gave the cyphering book to @entity112 after @entity2 's death , and @entity112 then gave them to other people , @entity85 said .			2

two new pages from the 1820s have been found to add to the math notebook believed to be the oldest surviving document written by @entity2
document may show @entity2 was better educated than thought with the future president attending school during parts of several years
