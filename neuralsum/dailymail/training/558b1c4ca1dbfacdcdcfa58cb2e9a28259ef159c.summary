by @entity1 reporter published : 11:39 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 12:07 est , 3 january 2014 there 's another quirk in the @entity7 administration 's new health insurance system : it lacks a way for consumers to quickly and easily update their coverage for the birth of a baby and other common life changes			2
with regular private insurance , parents just notify the health plan			2
insurers will still cover new babies , the administration says , but parents will also have to contact the government at some point later on			1
right now the @entity24 website ca n't handle such updates			1
and the system 's wiring for some vital federal functions is n't yet fully connected			2
it 's not just having a new baby that could create bureaucratic hassles , but other life changes affecting a consumer 's taxpayer - subsidized premiums			2
the list includes marriage and divorce , a death in the family , a new job or a change in income , even moving to a different community			0
such changes affect financial assistance available under the law , so the government has to be brought into the loop			1
at least 2 million people have signed up for private health policies through new government markets under president @entity7 's overhaul			1
coverage started wednesday , and so far things appear to be running fairly smoothly , although it may take time for problems to bubble up			1
@entity73 secretary @entity72 calls it ' a new day in health care ' for millions of @entity35			0
insurers say computerized ' change in circumstance ' updates to deal with family and life developments were supposed to have been part of the federal system from the start			0
but that feature got postponed as the government scrambled to fix technical problems that overwhelmed the health care website during its first couple of months			1
' it 's just another example of ` we 'll fix that later , ' said @entity93 , an industry consultant who said he 's gotten complaints from several insurer clients			0
' this needed to be done well before january			0
it 's sort of a fly - by - night approach			0
' ' we are currently working with insurers to find ways to make changing coverage easier while we develop an automated way for consumers to update their coverage directly , ' responded an administration spokesman , @entity106			0
a dec. 31 circular from the @entity108 addressed the problem			1
in questions and answers for insurers , the government said that the federal insurance marketplace will not be able to add a child until the system 's automated features become ' available later			1
' it does not provide any clue as to when that might take place			0
babies can not yet be added : the government needs to get involved because tax credits and other financial assistance can change the federal marketplace serves 36 states through @entity24 and call centers			1
the @entity130 agency , which runs the government 's other major health programs , is also responsible for expanded coverage under @entity7 's law			1
the question - and - answer circular says parents with a new baby will be told to contact their insurer directly ' to include the child immediately ' on their existing policy			0
after the federal system is ready to process changes , parents will have to contact the government to formally bring their records up to date			2
mr @entity106 said parents will be able to add a new child to their policy for 30 days			0
having a baby could increase a family 's monthly premiums , but it could also mean that the parents are eligible for a bigger tax credit to help with the cost			0
under some circumstances , it could make the child or the family eligible for @entity157 , a safety - net program that is virtually free of cost to low - income beneficiaries			0
' add it to the list that shows @entity24 is not done , ' ms @entity161 said .			1

the problem stems from the @entity24 website being unable to handle such requests
such changes affect financial assistance available under the law , so the government has to be involved
the government has said the feature will become available later , but not given a time frame
