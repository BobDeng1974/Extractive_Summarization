families will start to feel they have more money each month , @entity0 will claim today as he urges @entity3 to ' celebrate ' low inflation			1
the chancellor will use a speech to claim the cost of living could start to fall within months after inflation dropped to a record low of 0.5 per cent			1
a supermarket price war and falling petrol prices means the @entity13 rate of inflation is at its lowest point for almost 15 years			1
a rise of 0.5 per cent means an average basket of goods which cost £ 100 in december 2013 had risen to only £ 105 last month			2
economists said that the continued plunge in the oil price means inflation is likely to fall further and that brief period of negative inflation was ' not entirely out of the question '			2
this would mean that average prices are falling , making life cheaper for most people			2
at the same time wages have started to rise , up 1.6 per cent in october , well ahead of falling inflation , which means people are better off in real terms			1
in a speech tonight to the @entity50 , mr @entity0 will say : ' of course we will always remain vigilant to ensure that inflation is low for the right reasons			2
' but we should not confuse this welcome news for @entity3 's households as a result of falling oil prices with the threat of damaging deflation that we see in the eurozone			2
' rising real incomes , a recovery spreading to all parts of our economy , and family budgets that can stretch that little bit further - let 's celebrate these effects of low inflation , not fear them			1
' latest figures show that wages were up 1.6 per cent in october , well ahead of falling inflation @entity73 falls in food and transport costs were the biggest drivers in the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent , the @entity76 said here are five key questions about the fall in inflation : why is inflation so low ? the key drivers are falls in fuel and food costs			1
these are caused by tumbling oil prices , which are at their lowest level for nearly six years , and fierce supermarket competition , which has resulted in negative food and drink inflation for six months			1
is it good news ? ultra-low inflation means the cost of living is barely rising , so wages give households more spending power than they would have			1
experts say this should spur spending , boosting the economy and cheering voters ahead of the general election in may			0
what might it mean for interest rates ? policymakers tackle rising inflation by raising interest rates , so low inflation should push back the timing of any hike in rates , which have been held at 0.5 % for nearly six years - easing the strain on mortgage borrowers but spelling more pain for savers			1
is there any downside to falling inflation ? negative inflation , or deflation , could potentially lead to a spiral of falling prices in which consumers postpone purchases and firms cancel investment			1
if wages then fall repayments on loans such as mortgages would become less affordable			0
what might happen now ? economists predict inflation will continue to fall to new record lows of around 0.2 % and some say there is an outside chance of a brief period of deflation , though the path is hard to predict given the volatile nature of oil prices			1
in addition to food and petrol bills falling , gas and electricity bills barely rose last month unlike last year when the @entity151 came under fire for large price hikes			1
the fall in inflation will ease pressure on household budgets as it boosts real - terms pay as well as pushing further into the future any need to raise interest rates			0
the @entity163 ’s governor @entity162 said inflation was likely to ‘ drift a little lower ’ in the coming months , admitting that deflation is ‘ possible ’			0
he insisted that interest rates would ‘ move up over the next couple of years ’ – but economists say they are unlikely to rise before 2016			0
mr @entity162 said : ‘ by and large , these figures are good news in the short - term for @entity3 households			0
‘ [ it ] means your pound is going to stretch further			0
the issue is to make sure this does n’t become more generalised ... a little bit of inflation is good for the economy			0
’ the drop will trigger a letter of explanation from mr @entity162 to the chancellor , because it means inflation is more than 1 per cent off the @entity185 per cent target			1
mr @entity0 will add : ' the low inflation we see here in the @entity3 - driven as it is almost entirely by external factors such as the oil price - is much more welcome than in the eurozone where inflation has been very low for some time and is now negative			2
' there the debate has understandably turned to the dangers of deflation - the risk of a self - reinforcing spiral where economic activity falters , consumers defer purchases as prices fall and nominal debt burdens become ever harder to manage			0
' mr @entity0 suggested the @entity207 's ( @entity207 ) inflation target could be changed so it is obliged to take action when inflation is below 2 per cent - as well as above it			0
' in the @entity3 our system is well equipped to deal with negative inflation shocks just as it dealt with the surge in commodity prices in 2010 and 2011 , ' he said			2
' a few months of very low or even negative inflation , driven mainly by external factors , does not in and of itself mean that we run the risk of deflation			0
' core inflation , which strips out those factors , remains relatively stable and indeed rose slightly in the data			0
' even more importantly , expectations about future inflation remain well anchored and the latest data show that earnings growth is accelerating not slowing down			0
' @entity229 's shadow treasury minister @entity230 said : ' plummeting global oil prices are the reason why the rate of inflation is falling here in @entity3			1
' but wages continue to be sluggish and the squeeze on living standards since 2010 means working people are £ 1,600 a year worse off under this government			0

@entity21 drops to 0.5 % , the lowest level since may 2000
supermarket price war and falling petrol prices trigger drop inflation
with wages rising , family incomes should go further each month
