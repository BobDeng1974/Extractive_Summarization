managing to capture the elusive @entity0 is a feat in itself			0
but three natural wonders all in the one photograph ? that certainly makes for spectacular picture			0
@entity7 photographer @entity6 got the @entity0 , the @entity8 and an erupting volcano all in one shot during a recent trip to @entity12			1
the aurora - chaser , from @entity14 , @entity15 , was at @entity16 when he photographed the @entity18 volcano erupting on october 21			1
the eruption is @entity12 's largest in over 200 years and is still going on today			1
three for one : a @entity7 photographer captured the @entity0 , the @entity8 and an erupting volcano in one shot another photo showcases the whole milky way with northern lights dancing in the starry sky with its rare red colour visible			1
@entity6 , 42 , said : ' i started shooting auroras and night sky about two and a half years ago			2
' i shot my first aurora picture in january 2012 from @entity14 in @entity7 where i live and from that time i have been chasing them regularly			2
i could not believe to get such an amazing show of wonders , i was so lucky			0
' the photographer captures the lights purely as a hobby and works full - time as a self - employed structural engineer			2
otherworldly : @entity6 encountered the triple - threat phenomenon at @entity16 in @entity12 chasing the sky : @entity6 shot his first aurora picture in january 2012 from @entity14 in @entity7 , and has been chasing them ever since explosive : the current @entity18 volcano eruption is @entity12 's largest in over 200 years he said : ' most of my aurora shots are taken from @entity15 on the far north of @entity7 , where i live but i did two photo expeditions to chase northern lights in @entity12 and other countries			1
' i picked @entity12 because it 's easy to get there from @entity7 and in case of bad weather or poor aurora activity you always have an option to shoot remarkable and raw @entity12 landscape instead			1
' i knew the volcano was erupting			0
i thought i might be able to photograph the @entity8 as well as the volcano but i never imagined for the cloud to break and release the glorious dancing lights			0
' mesmerising : spotting aurora corona , a converging spectrum of colours , is a rare event @entity6 added : ' every aurora display is unique			2
the most exciting thing is seeing aurora corona , a converging spectrum of colours , but that does n't happen too often , especially in @entity7 which is too far south			2
@entity6 took the most recent shots on a trip to @entity12 which he has just returned from			1
his images have won astro - photography competitions around the world			1
he said : ' i 've never considered myself as the world 's best in capturing the lights , but some people have suggested that i am one of the leading photographers in that field			0
leading the way : the 42 - year - old structural engineer is considered one of the world 's best aurora photographers award - winning : @entity6 's images have won astro - photography competitions around the world talent : he was born and educated in @entity94 and has lived in @entity7 for more than ten years options : @entity6 favours @entity12 as if there is bad weather or poor aurora activity , there is always @entity12 landscape to shoot ' i am never completely happy with my work and always see space for some improvement			1
' on his recent trip the photographer shot a time lapse of the aurora showcasing its lights sweep across a bay			0
he said : ' shooting the lights is n't simple			0
it depends on the aurora activity and its brightness			0
' @entity6 was born and educated in @entity94 and has lived in @entity7 for more than ten years , currently living in the town of @entity14 in @entity15			1
he added : ' the exciting experience will stay with me for a long time , it was truly amazing			0
