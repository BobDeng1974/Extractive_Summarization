by @entity0 @entity2 is in danger of sleepwalking into a split from @entity5 unless the @entity7 campaign shows more ‘ hunger ’ , a cabinet minister has warned			1
@entity9 , the @entity10 , cautioned that the @entity12 campaign was gaining momentum and could win the 18 september referendum			1
his warning came after a weekend when the no camp was thrown into self - inflicted turmoil on the key issue of whether an independent @entity2 could keep the @entity19			1
more hunger : @entity9 , the @entity21 , warned that @entity7 campaigners could lose because they are less passionate than the nationalists polls have also narrowed in recent days , with the nationalists whittling the pro-union better together campaign ’s lead down to just five points			1
mr @entity9 , a @entity21 , told the @entity29 ’s @entity28 that the @entity12 campaign ‘ have got an unprecedented war chest to pour into this campaign ’			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve got to realise what is coming and as a consequence we ’ve got to get our arguments in place and our campaign as sharp as theirs			0
’ the @entity41 campaign suffered a blow after an unnamed senior minister was quoted in the @entity44 as saying that an independent @entity2 could be allowed to keep the @entity19 if it agreed not to remove the @entity46 nuclear deterrent from its base in @entity48			1
there was speculation that the minister was @entity52 , the defence secretary			0
much of the no campaign ’s argument for why @entity2 should stay in the @entity7 has been built around it not being allowed to keep @entity19 if it opts to go it alone			1
@entity2 first minister @entity58 seized on the admission , saying : ‘ all this bluff and bluster about not sharing @entity19 is a campaign tactic , a negotiating position , something to scare the natives up in @entity2			2
’ he ruled out any deal that would let the @entity7 keep nuclear weapons in @entity2 in exchange for a currency union			1
mr @entity9 said that well - funded independence campaign could spend its way to victory , and had an advantage because its supporters are ' defined ' by the issue			1
more support : mr @entity9 said more figures from the @entity78 should rally around better together leader @entity79 ( left ) , who are the official opposition to the nationalists , led by @entity58 ( right ) speaking to the @entity82			1
he said : ' we 're never going to match them for the spend , but in terms of the hunger i think we have to match them for just how badly we want this			0
' he said that though he was not ' expecting to lose ' , a victory for the nationalists was ' not impossible '			0
' for nationalists this is the issue that defines them , whereas for a @entity78 supporter , a @entity97 or a @entity98 , this can be an issue you care about but is not one that defines you			2
' so that is where we need to work harder at motivating our people in a way that their people come ready motivated			0
' you have in @entity79 a first - rate campaign head , but i would want to hear and would expect to hear a wider range of @entity78 voices coming into the debate as it gets closer to polling day			1
' a government minister has allegedly said @entity2 could keep the pound after all in exchange for housing the @entity7 's nuclear arsenal			1
the unnamed minister , quoted by the @entity119 , said ' of course ' there would be a deal struck over the pound if @entity2 votes for independence , hinting that it could be used as a bargaining chip in a deal to continue housing nuclear submarines in the @entity130			2
he said : ' there would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a @entity12 vote with many moving pieces			2
the @entity7 wants to keep @entity46 nuclear weapons at @entity48 and the @entity137 wants a currency union - you can see the outlines of a deal			2
' however , both the @entity142 and the @entity143 has denied such a deal could take place			0
@entity2 first minister @entity58 said negotiations on the pound would not include the @entity46 nuclear deterrent , to which he said the @entity142 was ' unambiguously opposed '			2
he said : ' our opposition to nuclear weapons is not a campaign tactic or a negotiating position			0
' of course there will be negotiations around the currency zone but they wo n't concern nuclear weapons , they will be about debt levels			0
' chancellor @entity160 and treasury secretary @entity161 also denied that a deal over the pound was possible			0
in a joint statement they said : ' the @entity137 are proposing to divorce the rest of the @entity7 but want to keep the joint bank account and credit card			0
' the @entity7 would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country and its banks			0
@entity174 would n't pass it , and the people would n't accept it			0
any suggestion to the contrary is wrong			0

@entity2 secretary @entity9 gave warning over @entity7 campaign
@entity182 supporters could be ' too late ' to beat well - funded @entity12 supporters
called on @entity78 in particular to increase support for preserving @entity7
