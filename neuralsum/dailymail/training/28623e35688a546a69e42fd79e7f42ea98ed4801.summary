@entity0 looks destined to leave @entity1 next summer after he revealed there is no prospect of his future being resolved			1
@entity0 , like @entity5 , can start talking to foreign clubs in 31 days about joining them on a @entity8 at the end of the season			1
but whereas @entity15 are in talks with their captain about a new deal , @entity0 ’s situation is drifting			1
the full back is clearly still committed to the cause — ending up with stitches in his head after diving in to score the winning goal — but has accepted that the end may be near			1
@entity15 's @entity0 strikes late with a header to give his side a vital 1 - 0 victory over @entity27 at @entity1 @entity15 have not made any contact with him about extending his terms and @entity0 , who has attracted interest from @entity31 , insists that he will not be pleading for a new deal			1
‘ i want to play for a club that wants me , ’ said @entity0 , who moved to @entity33 from @entity34 for £ 17.5million in 2009			1
‘ i ’ve seen some stuff that i have been offered half the money i am on			2
i have n’t been offered anything			0
‘ time goes very quick			0
i ’ve enjoyed my time here , the majority of the six years			0
there have been some good times , some bad times			0
but if i have n’t got a contract , i ca n’t stay			2
it does play on your mind but you have to be professional and do your best			0
i respect my team - mates more than anyone			2
@entity0 celebrates scoring the vitally important winner with a thumbs up to the @entity1 crowd late on ‘ i ’m not going to go crawling to anybody			1
they know where i am and they know the situation			0
there were minor talks at the end of last season but nothing that i could accept or reject			0
‘ i do n’t worry about things that i ca n’t control			0
all i can keep doing is my job			0
whatever will unfold will unfold			0
it ’s not my business to talk to other clubs			0
i ’m concentrating on winning for @entity15			1
i want to respect my contract and that ’s what i will do			2
’ this has not been an easy season for @entity0			1
with @entity76 constantly chopping and changing his defence , his form has dipped and he has lost his place in the @entity80 squad			1
@entity0 is congratulated by his @entity15 team - mates but needed treatment after taking a hit while scoring that has led to him becoming a target for supporters ’ frustrations			1
there were a number of growls on saturday when he made a mistake in the third minute			2
aside from that @entity0 did little wrong and followed up bravely after @entity93 ’s effort struck the woodwork			1
‘ it hurts a lot less when the ball hits the net , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ when @entity93 headed it , i thought it was going to hit the bar , so i just kept going			0
we fought hard and i would have been very upset if we ’d only drawn			0
’ @entity76 sprinted down the touchline and celebrated the goal with supporters			0
behind him , his assistants and @entity15 ’s substitutes vaulted from their seats			1
@entity76 reflected : ‘ there was a feeling of elation , probably a mixture of relief			0
@entity15 captain @entity5 looks on from the bench during the first half after being rested for the match @entity117 denies @entity76 rift ‘ we ’ve got to make slow steps			2
the scrutiny was on us in a big game against a tough side but we came through it very well			0
’ @entity27 will consider themselves unlucky			2
on another day @entity125 would have scored rather than hitting the post			2
‘ there was n’t any real momentum behind @entity15 ’s play and we dealt with that quite easily , ’ said @entity27 manager @entity127			1
‘ we let ourselves down			0
we had three or four defenders and ( @entity0 ) reacted quicker than we did when it bounced off the bar			2
’ @entity15 manager @entity76 looks cheerful after his side secured a late win at @entity1 against @entity27			1
