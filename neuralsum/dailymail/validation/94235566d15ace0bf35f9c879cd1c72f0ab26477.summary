at a time when few women would leave their houses alone , @entity0 braved war , floods and male scorn to complete arduous solo journeys in @entity8 and the @entity9			1
from 1894 to 1897 the @entity11 explorer trekked across @entity12 while it was with war with @entity14 , documenting the lives of the men and women she met through detailed written accounts and a collection of vivid photographs			1
some of her incredible journeys , published in her 1899 work in the @entity25 and @entity26 , are now the subject of a new book by @entity29			1
' @entity0 did n't become famous as a travel writer until she was 44 - at that time women just did n't have careers as writers			1
and it was n't until she was 60 that she discovered photography			1
' in her book , @entity50 charts @entity0 's three years spent travelling in @entity12 and reprints her stunning photographs of @entity12 daily life gradually being infiltrated by @entity55 clothing and customs			1
@entity0 turned to writing as a way to make money for her and her unmarried sister born in 1831 the daughter of a clergyman , as @entity50 writes : ' the adventuress who travelled and rode in all weathers , exploring remote and dangerous regions , was writing about a life in sharp contrast to the one originally envisaged for her			2
' the intrepid @entity70 woman started writing in 1854 when she travelled to @entity8 to mend a broken heart			0
but it was n't until 1875 that she found fame with an account of her experiences in @entity76			0
bird was on her way home from an ill - fated trip to @entity81 when she fell in love with the islands			0
she initially wrote extensive accounts of her escapades to her sister , and decided that writing would provide a much - needed income for the unmarried pair			0
on her return , @entity0 embarked on her publishing career and her candid accounts of her travel became instant bes - sellers , and she has n't been out of print since			2
@entity50 writes : ' as a respected international traveller her views were sought by prime ministers , ambassadors and the newspaper men of the day			0
' her books were engaging , accessible and entertaining and she opened up a world of travel to the armchair explorer			2
' despite saying she was too old for arduous journeys , @entity0 travelled 8,000 miles during an extended trip to @entity12 , travelling on horseback and in carts , by boat and in a sedan chair , using her newly acquired camera and photographic skills to document her journey			1
she traversed the country , from @entity115 ( @entity115 ) to @entity116 and from one end of the @entity25 to the other as well as venturing into @entity119 and @entity14			0
@entity0 was 60 - years - old when she discovered photography , and developed all her prints herself in her letters home to her sister , @entity0 tells how she loved everything about the process of photography in 1894 she set off from @entity125 to the @entity9 unaware she was travelling into the @entity126 between @entity12 and @entity14 over control of @entity119			1
she was deported from @entity119 on a @entity14 steamer with no money and luggage and only the clothes on her back and was forced to take refuge in @entity12			2
there she experienced a flood on the @entity136 and risked her life helping drowning villagers in terrific storms before succumbing to malaria			0
she then broke her arm when the cart she was travelling in overturned just miles from the house of the missionary who was to take her in			0
confined to the town of @entity146 ( @entity146 ) by her injuries , she spent time getting to know the missionary doctors and photographing their patients , many of whom suffered from leprosy or the effects of opium addiction			0
@entity0 's account of her travels was hailed by one reviewer at the time as ' one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of late nineteenth century @entity12 ever written ' as well as the scorn of her countrymen , @entity0 also had to contend with the hostility of the locals who were not used to seeing a foreigner , let alone a foreign woman , travelling her photographs of this time show pagodas and palaces as well as the mean back streets and the ravaged faces of disese sufferers			1
while travelling in the @entity12 interior she managed to avoid the plagues of rats and other vermin by suspending her clothes and boots on the tripod of her camera			2
she adopted @entity12 dress as the tight fitting , tailored clothes she was used to were considered offensive by the local population			2
in her book , @entity50 charts @entity0 's three years spent travelling in @entity12 and reprints her stunning photographs of @entity12 daily life gradually being infiltrated by @entity55 clothing and customs @entity0 's legacy is her iron will and her determination to never give up in the face of adversity , says @entity50 however she did not quite escape the curiosity or hostility of the locals who were not used to seeing a foreigner , let alone a foreign woman , travelling			1
@entity50 writes : ' overnight halts were a problem because of the stir she created by her arrival			0
this could range from curiosity to extreme hostility â€“ from holes drilled through the walls of her room followed by whispering and giggling , to a full - blown riot with shouts of " foreign devil " , " @entity213 "			0
' she also received the scorn of her countrymen , with archaeologist sir @entity216 writing to her publisher 's son : ' i must say i think the woman must be devoid of all delicacy and modesty who could travel as she did , without a female attendant among a crowd of dirty @entity227 muleteers and others			0
' however @entity0 's account of her travels was hailed by one reviewer at the time as ' one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of late nineteenth century @entity12 ever written			1
' in response to sir @entity216 criticism , @entity50 writes : ' not bad for an account of a journey " undertaken for recreation an interest solely " or " but to satisfy her curiosity and love of travel "			0
' and what about @entity0 's legacy ? ' never give up ! and do n't think you 're ever too old to do anything , ' @entity50 tells us			1
' if you want , it 's possible to have a new career at 60			0
