a taxi driver has been ordered to pay compensation to a passenger who was left with severe brain injuries after he jumped out of the moving car			1
@entity5 , now 27 , was on his way home from a night out in @entity8 , @entity9 , with his girlfriend in a taxi driven by @entity12 , 56 , five years ago			2
mr @entity12 , a former soldier , had mistakenly believed mr @entity5 was planning to ' do a runner ' and decided to drive him back to the rank in a bid to teach him a lesson			1
but when mr @entity5 objected , the driver continued on for almost a mile , leading him to jump from the vehicle while it was travelling at more than 20mph			2
he suffered devastating brain injuries , developed epilepsy and now requires round - the - clock care from his mother			0
mr @entity5 ' family , from @entity8 , took driver mr @entity12 to the @entity25 ( pictured ) , where a judge ruled he had unlawfully imprisoned his passenger mr @entity28 ' family , from @entity8 , took mr @entity12 to the @entity25			1
there , mr @entity29 ruled the driver had unlawfully imprisoned mr @entity5 , who was therefore entitled to damages			1
the exact amount of compensation is yet to be decided - but is set to be around 50 per cent of what the family had requested and thought to be ' hundreds of thousands of pounds '			0
speaking on behalf of the family , lawyer @entity37 said : ' this was a terrible incident in which @entity5 suffered a very severe brain injury leaving him needing care for the rest of his life			0
' the latest judgement agrees that @entity5 is entitled to a settlement to provide specialist rehabilitation and care which will help maximise his progress			0
' mr @entity5 , who was 23 at the time of the incident , had gotten into the taxi with his girlfriend @entity52 at @entity54 taxi rank in @entity8 to his home in the @entity57 area , according to high court documents			1
in a police interview , mr @entity12 said he had become suspicious after hearing ms @entity52 joke that the couple were not going to ' do a runner '			2
deciding the issue of liability , the judge said mr @entity12 mistakenly decided mr @entity5 was not going to pay the fare on november 2 in 2010 , adding there was no basis for him to think so			1
the driver had decided to take mr @entity5 back to the rank to cause him as much inconvenience as possible			1
mr @entity5 , who found himself being unlawfully driven off by a stranger into the night , decided he should try to escape			2
mr @entity29 said : ' the end result is that the claimant decided to jump out of the taxi at a dangerous speed			0
i do not know why he did this			0
' it may have been that he misjudged the speed and thought it was safe to do so , but the true motive will never be known			0
' he said had mr @entity5 jumped out when it was stationary at lights there would be no permanent damage			1
mr @entity5 had gotten into the taxi at the @entity54 rank in @entity8 ( pictured ) in 2010 with his girlfriend ' i have broadly accepted the evidence of the defendant and therefore find that his intention was not to do anything other than to return him to the rank where he would be released , ' he added			2
' this is the kind of conduct which creates a significant risk to life and limb as this case demonstrates			0
' the judge said it was a ' stark and unattractive choice ' to decide between the two - and concluded there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the damages payable to mr @entity5			1
he was also entitled to a further Â£ 250 for unlawful imprisonment			0
lawyers representing mr @entity5 said the incident left him with ' devastating ' brain injuries and he is now being cared for by his mother @entity108			2
speaking at the time the claim was lodged with the @entity25 , @entity37 , said : ' whilst he has undergone extensive treatment and rehabilitation , he has developed post-traumatic epilepsy , headaches , fatigue , suffers social and behavioural problems and has no sense of taste or smell			0
' he is reliant on 24 - hour care from his mum and is unable to work			1
' both sides were given permission to appeal and a further hearing will determine the amount which mr @entity12 will have to pay .			0

driver @entity12 , 56 , thought passenger was planning to ' do a runner '
so he decided to take passenger @entity5 him back to the taxi rank
mr @entity5 jumped out , sustaining head injuries , and now needs 24 - hour care
judge rules mr @entity5 was unlawfully imprisoned and will now get damages
