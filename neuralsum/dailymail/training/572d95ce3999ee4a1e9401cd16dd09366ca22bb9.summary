one of the most tumultuous years in @entity1 cricket history ended with another batting collapse and an admission from @entity4 that he could have ‘ no complaints ’ if the selectors sack him as one - day captain			1
@entity9 have lost yet another 50 - over series – and they are losing their credibility			1
the sight of @entity4 standing his ground as he waited for the third umpire to confirm that @entity15 had caught him cleanly at slip felt like a fitting coda to an often hapless tour			2
it was the desperate act of a captain ill - suited to a form of the game in which @entity9 – whose 89 - run defeat here condemned them to a 5 - 2 loss – are in danger of being cast adrift			1
@entity9 's hapless players watch the presentations after the 87 - run defeat by @entity32 in @entity33 @entity4 endured an awful tour with the bat and as captain ( he only led @entity9 to one win in the series ) @entity40 waves as he walks off after his last ever one - day international on @entity43 soil @entity32 's captain @entity44 holds the series trophy after his side easily beat @entity9 on saturday , barring a late change of heart , the selectors will name @entity4 as their leader at next year ’s @entity50			1
and if that is confirmed , the @entity51 will stand accused of sleep - walking their way to disaster			0
@entity4 insisted he retained his appetite for the job , even if he has not been able to produce the runs or the results			2
‘ we ’ll find out in a couple of days ’ time whether i will be doing it , ’ he said			0
‘ i think we can surprise people at the @entity50 , but we ’re going to have to play better than we have here			2
‘ no one ’s got any divine right to play for @entity9 at all , and my performances this year in the one - day game have n’t been good enough			1
i ca n’t have any complaints if the decision went against me			1
‘ it ’s tough when you lose games of cricket and do n’t score runs			2
but i ’m still hungry to do it			0
whether the selectors still think i ’m the right man , we ’ll wait and see			0
’ the details of this fifth and final defeat of the series do not make happy reading			0
@entity32 racked up 302 for six , thanks to 101 from @entity82 and a 26 - ball 54 from @entity83			1
then , with the exception of the excellent @entity85 , @entity9 made a predictable meal of their chase			1
@entity88 and @entity89 fell early to aggressive shots , but @entity4 ’s 32 in 49 deliveries made for painful watching			2
almost lbw first ball , he was dropped at slip on one , and nearly bowled off an inside edge five runs later			0
a slog - sweep for six off @entity97 was a punchy retort , but @entity4 then got away with an edge off seamer @entity100 that flew between keeper and slip			1
soon , another edge off @entity104 was snaffled by @entity15			0
@entity4 did n’t want to go			1
of course he did n’t			0
but as he lingered , awaiting the inevitable judgement of @entity106 , he looked like the loneliest man in @entity33			2
@entity15 plays a classic cover drive on his way to 28 from 31 deliveries the veteran batsman gestures to the crowd after being clapped off during his final international in @entity32 @entity40 gets on the front foot and whacks one through the legside @entity32 opener @entity82 gets down on one knee to play his trademark ' @entity120 ' shot the hosts ' captain @entity44 plays a reverse sweep as @entity32 head for a big score @entity82 plays the ball through the offside ( left ) and salutes his century by pointing to the sky @entity82 jumps for joy after reaching three figures in @entity33 @entity132 hits a six as @entity32 pile on the runs in the final 10 overs of their innings @entity83 was also part of the hosts ' onslaught at the end , bludgeoning his way to 50 for all managing director @entity143 ’s talk of the progress @entity9 have made this year from the lowest of bases – and in the case of a few players he has a point – they have lost eight of the 11 bilateral series played either partially or completely in 2014			1
and that does n’t include the @entity153 , where they were humiliated by the @entity155			0
only the 3 - 1 @entity157 win over @entity158 can be looked back on with much pride			0
the rest has been middling to poor – and worse			0
this performance belonged in the last category			0
@entity9 will reason that they are closer to knowing their @entity50 team than they were when they arrived in @entity32 : @entity88 , @entity164 , @entity85 and @entity165 have all enhanced their reputations			1
but @entity169 , out for four as he pre-meditated a sweep , is sinking fast , @entity167 looks tired , and @entity170 had a quiet tour			0
@entity89 has been messed around by the selectors			0
@entity88 is bowled by @entity82 from the first ball he faced in a woeful start by @entity9 @entity4 watches as the ball goes through the covers as he tries to get @entity9 back on track @entity9 captain cook wears an anguished expression after being dismissed for 32 @entity100 celebrates dismissing @entity164 during another dismal innings for @entity9 @entity40 successfully appeals for the wicket of @entity169 , who was given out lbw after a review @entity167 skies one on the offside but is caught on the cover boundary @entity85 top - scored for @entity9 , again doing well with the bat in a losing cause @entity165 of @entity9 is bowled comprehensively by @entity97 as his stumps go flying for @entity190 and @entity191 it may be time to say goodbye , though @entity193 is young and talented enough to qualify for an au revoir			1
this , though , was no way to convince an increasingly sceptical @entity1 cricketing public that their team will have a prayer at the @entity50			2
@entity32 , energised by a crowd who were cheering on the final one - day appearances on home soil of @entity15 and his fellow legend @entity40 , outplayed @entity9 in every department			1
the pair even combined to take the last wicket : sentimentally thrown the ball by captain @entity44 , @entity15 had @entity209 stumped by his old buddy			0
these sides will meet again during the @entity50 at @entity212 , where @entity32 will hope to capitalise on an 8 - 4 winning record against @entity9 in one - dayers this year			1
you would n’t bet against them			0
as @entity4 said : ‘ it ’s been a hell of a year			2

@entity9 lose one - day international series 5 - 2 after falling in @entity33
@entity82 scored a hundred as @entity32 *posted* 302 for six
@entity85 top scorer for @entity9 with *80* as they were all out for *215*
@entity4 said he ' ca n’t have any complaints ' if dropped as @entity228 captain
on saturday , @entity4 is likely to be named @entity9 's @entity50 skipper
