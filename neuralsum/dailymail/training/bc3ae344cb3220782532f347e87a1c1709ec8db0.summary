a five - year - old girl who was born with legs ‘ like a frog ’ has taken her first steps thanks to special splints			1
@entity5 suffers from a rare condition that caused her to be born with almost no muscle in her legs and arms			1
her parents were told she would die during birth after scans showed that her limbs were dangerously twisted			2
her parents ( @entity19 and @entity20 , pictured ) were told that she would spend her entire life in a wheelchair but thanks to special splints she has taken her first steps despite being encouraged to have a termination , they refused to give up hope on their daughter			1
they were told that if she survived she would probably need to use a wheelchair her whole life			2
however , @entity5 has now taken her first steps using leg - straightening splints after an operation to stretch her muscles			1
her mother , @entity34 , 42 , said : ‘ when she was born , her legs were curled up and her feet back - to - front			1
she looked like a little frog			2
‘ her arms were bent and her hands were twisted outwards			2
i feel terrible saying it , but it was incredibly disturbing			0
@entity5 's condition was picked up at her mother 's 20 - week pregnancy scan			1
doctors advised @entity19 , and husband , @entity20 , to have her aborted because they feared she would not survive birth ‘ but i remember saying : " my daughter is going to walk , run and dance			2
she ’s going to do everything other children do ”			0
‘ i was not going to accept what they were saying but it has n’t been easy			0
i was close to giving up			0
‘ if you ’d told me a year ago my daughter would walk unaided i would think you were utterly mad			2
‘ she has overcome so many hurdles in such a short space of time			0
’ @entity5 ’s condition was picked up at her mother ’s 20 - week scan , leaving mrs @entity5 and husband @entity20 , 50 , from @entity64 , @entity65 , devastated			1
the full - time mother said : ‘ we were utterly blown apart			2
i had two images in my head - a little white coffin and a child in a wheelchair			1
she spent much of her first few years of life with her legs in plaster but this failed to enable her to walk so she was referred to @entity77 for further treatment arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a collective term for a large number of different syndromes characterised by non-progressive , joint curvatures that are present at @entity87 the condition is present , the muscles in the baby 's limbs tend to be partially or completely replaced by fat and fibrous @entity91 condition is present in about one in every 3,000 babies and is usually detected before @entity94 options include physiotherapy , splinting and surgery			1
‘ i was determined to carry on with my pregnancy though			0
‘ @entity20 and i coped with it very differently			0
he found it very hard to talk about it			0
‘ i went out and bought baby clothes of all different ages because i just refused to accept what they were telling me			2
it was my little act of defiance			0
’ @entity5 was born a week early by caesarean section and doctors diagnosed her with multiple arthrogryposis , a congenital condition that causes curved joints			1
the condition affects about 260 babies in the @entity114 every year			2
after four days in hospital , @entity5 was discharged and allowed home			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ what ’s meant to be an amazing time , was pretty horrific			1
‘ people were coming round saying congratulations but we found it difficult to respond positively			0
‘ i went into “ mum ” mode			0
i fed her , washed and dressed her but really i was just going through the motions			0
’ at five - weeks - old , doctors put @entity5 ’s legs in plaster in an attempt to straighten them			1
@entity5 spent six week with her legs in full - length plaster casts before she was fitted with splints			1
she also had surgery to stretch her leg muscles but after three years , they realised it was having no effect and she was transferred to @entity140 ’s @entity77 , where she underwent surgery			1
she was put in plaster from her hip right down to her feet for six weeks before doctors fitted full length splints			1
they were designed to keep her legs straight but she still could n’t walk			2
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ our physiotherapist gave us a special ride - on horse to help her get around			1
‘ she loved it and called it @entity153			0
it gave her that little bit of independence for the first time in her life			0
we ’d always had to carry her before			0
@entity5 became so distressed every time her parents put the splints on that they nearly gave up			1
however , when they tried them for the last time she took her first steps using a push - along dog for support @entity5 is now waiting to see a specialist about her arms but is looking forward to being able to take part in her first school sports day @entity5 is now able to take part in a stage school play at the family 's local theatre ‘ every morning , i ’d try to put her splints on and she ’d scream her head off			1
she ’d beg me not to put them on			0
‘ she did n’t cry , she sobbed			0
it was heart - wrenching			2
‘ @entity20 could n’t do it because he found it too upsetting			0
‘ i remember thinking whether i did n’t know if i could do it anymore			0
i was questioning if i was doing the right thing			0
‘ i decided to give it one more try and if she did n’t walk , i ’d leave it			2
my daughter would be in a wheelchair like the doctors said			2
’ to her mother ’s amazement , @entity5 took her first steps with a push - along dog the next day			1
and now , she ’s progressed to walking unaided			0
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ she was very wobbly but she did it			1
i showed her teachers the video and they cried			0
‘ she walked to school every day last week			1
we had to leave early but i do n’t care			0
‘ it ’s absolutely incredible what she ’s achieved			0
she loves showing people that she can do it now			0
‘ she ’s taking part in her first sports day this week and is in a stage school play at our local theatre			1
all the things i hoped for are becoming a reality			0
’ the couple , who also have a son , @entity213 , seven , and two - year - old daughter , @entity214 , are now waiting to see a specialist about how to flex @entity5 ’s arms			1
@entity5 's parents ( also pictured with son @entity213 , seven , and daughter @entity214 , two ) say that their daughter has taught them to overcome challenges mrs @entity5 said : ‘ she is the most beautiful child you will ever know			1
‘ it has been difficult but she has taught me and our family how to overcome and push through challenges			0
’ mr @entity228 , chief executive of a drug and alcohol intervention service , said : ‘ when @entity5 was born i really struggled as i just did not know how to cope			1
