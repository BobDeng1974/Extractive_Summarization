by @entity0 true @entity1 should applaud their former manager @entity2 as he takes his place in the away dug - out at @entity4 today			1
that is what @entity6 , @entity7 ’s captain under @entity2 when they played @entity9 football in 2005 , believes			1
realistically , though , @entity6 knows the old bear pit of a stadium will be at its most raucous and partisan today as they get ready to ‘ welcome ’ not one but three former @entity7 icons , who walked out on them to join the detested @entity17			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity2 cracking jokes ahead of the game warm welcome ? @entity2 returns to @entity4 for the first time as @entity17 manager on sunday old boys : @entity24 ( @entity25 ) and @entity26 will also be going back to their former club @entity7 if the sound levels will be loud for @entity2 , they will be off the scale when @entity24 and @entity26 walk down the tunnel in red			1
both managers are n’t even bothering to ignore the animosity that will exist			0
@entity2 pointed out that sir @entity35 used to pull @entity24 out of @entity7 games because of the abuse he got			1
@entity38 , who beneath his butter - would n’t - melt demeanour quite enjoys the jousting , has not helped @entity26 by indicating the £ 27million @entity42 would not be able to get in the current @entity7 team			1
ouch ! fall from grace : @entity24 used to be pulled out of @entity7 games by @entity35 because of the abuse new kid on the block : @entity24 celebrates scoring for @entity7 against @entity49 in 2004 @entity7 fans have been debating all week whether they should cheer or boo @entity2 , weighing up 11 years of good service against the ‘ treachery ’ of joining @entity17 and then trying to take @entity26 and @entity53 with him			1
the game is important in pure football terms , too			0
@entity7 need three points to keep in touch with @entity58 in the race for fourth			1
having been hammered by @entity60 and @entity61 , defeat at @entity4 will feel like another nail in @entity2 ’ coffin			1
the league table currently shows he has taken @entity17 from first to seventh			2
amid the bedlam , @entity6 — a hugely - respected figure at @entity4 who played 269 games in eight years and then served on the coaching staff — hopes @entity2 ’ positive contribution to @entity7 will not be forgotten			1
‘ the vast majority of @entity7 fans are good football people			2
they understand the game and will appreciate the hard word @entity77 put and the legacy he left , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ knowing them , they would n’t understand why he left because they love @entity7 so much			2
they would be devastated to think he saw @entity17 as a step up			2
they do n’t ! legacy : former @entity7 captain @entity6 insists true @entity1 will applaud @entity2 ‘ @entity7 is my club and i ’d love to think true @entity1 would all applaud @entity77			1
but if i ’m honest , maybe it wo n’t be that way			0
i think it will be mixed			0
’ @entity6 has himself had a turbulent first season in management , sacked by @entity89 after just 13 games before celebrating promotion to the @entity92 with @entity93 as their assistant - manager			2
from experience , he knows just how good @entity2 is			2
‘ first of all , he is a great coach			0
that is the most important thing , his knowledge of the game and the information he has , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ he is really detailed , interested in how other teams to play			0
his attention to detail is very good			0
at times , we walked out the tunnel feeling we ’d played the game already , we knew what the opposition was going to do			0
‘ he left no stone unturned , we had video meetings that could go on for an hour			0
it was all about planning for all eventualities			0
it was a thoroughness that stood the team in good stead – you just felt prepared			0
poisoned chalice ? things have n't gone according to plan since @entity2 agreed to replace @entity35 ( @entity25 ) hands off ! some @entity7 fans were angered by @entity2 pursuit of left - back @entity53 ( @entity25 ) ‘ i think @entity17 know that and i would expect him to be there in 12 months			1
he gets to the heart of things quickly			0
‘ we had a really sticky start under him at @entity7 and @entity125 was probably under pressure to make a change because the fans were n’t happy			2
‘ but he stuck with him and i genuinely have no doubt if @entity17 do the same , he ’ll get it right			2
his over-riding character trait is single - mindedness			0
i ’ve not seen it to that extent in anyone else			0
’ for all @entity6 ’s plaudits , @entity2 knows he has to show he can win big games as @entity17 boss			1
perhaps the most damning statistic of his @entity17 reign so far is that the team have managed to win only six points from a possible 33 against the @entity146 ’s top six			2
final farewell : @entity2 waves to supporters during his last game in charge at the club staying power : @entity2 has awarded @entity24 a new contract , despite his falling out with @entity35 @entity2 tried to distance himself from the shadow of sir @entity35 by awarding @entity24 a five - year deal when @entity35 wanted him out			1
now , he is going to trust @entity24 in a fixture @entity35 sometimes felt was too much for the player			0
@entity24 , a boyhood @entity7 fan , joined @entity17 in 2004 despite once claiming ‘ once a @entity159 , always a @entity159 ’ , has regularly received abuse at @entity4 and @entity35 left him out of a game there in 2010			1
‘ i know @entity24 ’s relationship with the @entity7 crowd was something @entity166 felt at times and took into account , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but @entity24 is a different player now			0
he ’s got maturity , just signed a new contract and is due to go to the @entity171			0
‘ if ever there was a player ready to play in any game it would be @entity24 , with the age he is , the time of his career , what he is capable of			1
he is about to be one of @entity182 ’s leading players in the @entity171 and you ’ll be expecting him to stand up , so i ’ll expect him to stand up and be seen at @entity4 on sunday			0
’ for the first time , @entity24 may have to share the billing as primary hate figure in an opposition shirt – with @entity7 fans disgruntled by the way @entity26 forced a deadline day move			1
@entity38 has n’t made things any easier for the @entity42 he thinks he got a good deal by selling @entity26 and signing @entity193 international @entity194 from @entity195 for less than half the price , £ 12.5million			1
not missed ! @entity38 claims that @entity26 would no longer get into his @entity7 team indeed , he does n’t believe @entity26 would get in his side , who start the day in fifth place , nine points ahead of @entity17 despite slipping up in midweek against @entity202			1
‘ you ’re looking at @entity194 , @entity207 , @entity208 — where would fellaini fit in ? ’ said @entity38 , all good fuel for the @entity7 faithful waiting to bait their former idol			1
‘ in football you move on so quickly			0
i ’m just so happy with the squad that we have			0
it ’s incredible to have that mixture of youth and experience			0
it looks like this side has been playing together for the last five years			0

@entity2 returns to @entity7 for the first time as @entity17 boss
@entity223 will be given a warm welcome by true @entity1 , says @entity6
@entity24 and @entity26 will also be *unsure* of their *reception*
@entity38 insists @entity26 would n't get in the current @entity7 side
