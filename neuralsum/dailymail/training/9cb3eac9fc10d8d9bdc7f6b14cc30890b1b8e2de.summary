a boy who grew up suffering daily abuse at the hands of his own mother has shared his horrific story			1
@entity5 ( not his real name to protect his identity ) , from @entity8 , said he received so many broken bones and serious injuries as a boy that he knew all the names of the nurses at his local hospital			1
he was so abused he thought daily beatings were a normal part of growing up			1
he explains : ' for as far back as i can remember my mother was violent towards me			2
i was physically assaulted virtually every day of my childhood			2
if i got through a day without being hit to the floor or in pain from a slap then it was a good day			2
i thought it was normal to live the way i lived and to be punished the way i was punished			2
for my 11th birthday she put both my hands on the table and broke each finger with a hammer			1
' another time she pressed a hot iron into my back			2
she told me she was punishing me for things i 'd done wrong but i think she used to get a kick out of being abusive to me			2
the worse and more in pain she made me feel , the happier she seemed to be			2
' despite @entity5 regularly being hospitalised due to his injuries , his mother 's violence was not uncovered because she was ' an expert liar ' and @entity5 was too afraid to tell the truth			1
he said : ' my mother would have an excuse for every injury ; she was an expert liar			1
on one occasion , my mother told the nurses that i 'd busted my head open by riding a bike down the house stairs			1
the truth was that she threw me down the stairs and a bike on top of me but i stayed silent because i did n't think anyone would believe me			1
' when we had visitors to the house , she 'd put on a loving mum act			2
she explained my bruises and broken limbs to family as me being clumsy			2
people believed her because she was a pillar of the community – she was well liked and very popular			0
no one could see behind the façade			0
' @entity5 's biological father left when he was born and his mother had a succession of boyfriends who were also abusive			1
@entity5 recalls : ' growing up i had five different surnames as my mother moved from relationship to relationship			1
all the men in my mother 's life were the same – they had alcohol problems and would physically assault my mother and me when they were drunk			1
' my mother blamed their behaviour on me and i would get an extra beating off her to punish me for what they 'd done to us			2
if they smacked her , she would smack me			0
i was like her personal punching bag and i think she took out the frustrations of her life on me			0
' as well as physical violence , @entity5 was also subjected to emotional abuse which made him feel worthless			1
horrific childhood : @entity5 suffered physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his own mother ( picture posed by model ) ' my mother told me her life was ruined the day i was born , ' he said			1
' she said that everything that had gone wrong in her life was my fault and that she wished she had killed me when i was a baby			0
' the emotional abuse was cruel and constant			0
if i was n't being shouted and screamed at and called a mistake then i was being ignored			0
i was never shown any love			0
' @entity116 is meant to be a magical time for children but for @entity5 , it meant more emotional trauma and violence			1
he said : ' my first memory , when i was around four or five years old , is from a @entity116 morning			0
i was made to sit and watch my older sister unwrap her presents and then i was told i did n't have any presents to unwrap because i did n't deserve any			0
i was sent upstairs to spend christmas day alone in my room without any food			0
' another @entity116 morning she slammed my head in the fridge door , breaking my nose			0
' @entity5 has shared his shocking story as new figures released by the @entity134 's @entity133 this week have revealed that calls to their counsellors increase in december			1
in december 2013 , their trained counsellors carried out almost 23,000 counselling sessions with children and young people on a huge range of subjects			2
the most common reason for contacting @entity133 was family relationship issues – anything from worries relating to parents separating to arguments with family members and wanting to leave home			1
in the same period , more than 1,600 children and young people contacted @entity133 feeling suicidal - a disturbing 38 per cent increase compared to december 2012 - and there was a 36 per cent increase in counselling sessions on the subject of low self - esteem and unhappiness			1
in addition , in december 2013 , @entity133 counsellors handled 776 counselling sessions where children mentioned feelings of loneliness , isolation or exclusion			1
@entity133 also reported a 24 per cent increase in the number of counselling sessions on christmas day compared to december 2012 , speaking to one child every four minutes on average			1
the new figures coincide with the launch of the @entity134 's @entity174 appeal to ensure its @entity133 service is able to offer support and hope to the thousands of children and young people expected to make contact this december			1
life line : @entity5 said speaking to @entity133 counsellors pulled him back from the brink of suicide ( picture posed by model ) it was this service that helped @entity5 and convinced him not to take his life when he was at his lowest ebb			1
he recalls : ' i called @entity133 for the first time the day after my 14th birthday			1
someone had visited my school and given a talk about how @entity133 could help people going through abuse			1
i called four times before i was able to speak			0
i was so afraid of my mother finding out and what she 'd do to me			2
' with @entity133 i heard a reassuring adult voice who was n't going to hurt me			1
i told them what my mother had done to me that day and they listened to me and did n't call me a liar			1
i cried for about 20 minutes in that telephone box because for the first time in my life , i was told that what was happening to me was wrong			0
' he added : ' i 've always wanted to say thank you to those voices on the other end of the phone			0
they do n't know it , but without them , i would n't be here now			0
i know how close i came to ending it all – @entity133 was the only thing that pulled me back			1
' my message for a child or young person going through what i went through is please know that you 're not alone			0
talk to someone and get help			0
do n't go through it on your own because with help from other people , your abuse can be stopped			0
' @entity5 finally became free of his wicked mother when he left home at 16 and joined the navy			1
now 32 , he is now married with a daughter and is determined to put his past behind him			0
he said : ' i do n't like looking back on my childhood			0
i 've tried to forget my past and what my mother did to me			2
every tattoo i have covers a scar she gave me			0
the tattoos cover burn marks , surgical scars to repair broken bones and old wounds			0
i have over 30 tattoos on my body – i would rather see a tattoo than a scar			0
' i 'm not in contact with my mother or other family members anymore			2
my family is now my wife and daughter who have shown me what love is			0
i 'm determined to give my daughter all the things i did n't have growing up			0
i make sure that every saturday is our day where we spend time going out to museums or playing together			0
through my daughter i feel like i 'm having my childhood again , i 'm trying to make up for lost time			0
