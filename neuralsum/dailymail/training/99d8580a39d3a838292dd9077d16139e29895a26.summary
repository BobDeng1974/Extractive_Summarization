by @entity1 reporter published : 12:43 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 26 june 2013 the budget for the @entity6 railway linking @entity7 to the @entity8 has increased by nearly £ 10 billion because of the addition of a tunnel to plans , the @entity3 has told @entity12			1
ahead of an expected rebellion by conservative mps , @entity13 said the £ 42.6billion budget also included a large contingency fund			1
the original budget had been about £ 33billion			1
the government argues the highly controversial @entity6 will help to bridge the @entity21 divide by cutting journey times and fuelling economic growth in the @entity8 and @entity21			2
the budget for the @entity6 railway has increased by nearly £ 10 billion to more than £ 40 billion partly because of the addition of a tunnel to plans , the @entity3 has told mps it hopes the first stage of the project , between @entity7 and @entity31 , would start in 2017 and finish in 2026			1
the second stage , to @entity33 and @entity34 , would be completed by 2033			2
@entity6 has previously said the tunnel would run between @entity38 and the eastern edge of @entity40 , the @entity36 reports			2
original plans involved using the existing @entity42 to @entity31 railway line before running under the @entity44			1
the first phase is now budgeted at £ 21.4 billion and the second phase at £ 21.2 billion , and includes a £ 12.7 billion contingency fund across the scheme			1
mr @entity13 said : ' i will be writing tomorrow to the chairman of @entity6 to set a target price for the delivery of phase of the project			2
that is £ 17 billion at 2011 prices			1
this takes account of the design and environmental changes to improve the scheme			2
' there was the point in relation to the @entity65 - a contingency was allowed and actually the price of the @entity65 came in below the price that had been set by the government			1
' while i expect the final costs to be lower than those i have just outlined ... this is the right way to plan the project			2
' the increased costs are a reflection of changes to the route , including a tunnel under the @entity44 at @entity31 , and an increased contingency fund			1
the revelations came as mps debated the @entity82 ( @entity84 ) @entity83 at second reading , proposals which pave the way for the development and planning of the line and allows spending by the @entity92 to get the project up and running			1
@entity13 said the £ 42.6 billion budget also included a large contingency fund mr @entity13 said : ' it is very important we are seen as being able to compete with other countries in the global race to attract businesses to this country			1
' i am going to be very open with the @entity103 and put all this into the ( public ) domain ... i want to be as open as i possibly can			2
' the @entity3 faced a series of questions from his own benches about compensation and mitigation for the scheme and said he had ' respect and understanding ' for objections			1
but he defended the project as being essential for @entity117 ’s future growth			0
' the easiest thing in the world for the government to do would be not to build @entity6 , ' mr @entity13 said			0
' but the cost of doing that would be huge			0
it would be a cost in jobs - our modest estimates are @entity6 will create and support 100,000 jobs , while the group of core cities predict @entity6 will underpin 400,000 jobs , 70 per cent of them outside @entity7			0
' it would be a cost in prosperity - some estimates suggest @entity6 will add over £ 4 billion to the economy even before it is open and the line is estimated to provide around £ 50 billion worth of economic benefits once it is up and running			1
' if we do n’t go ahead with @entity6 , there will also be a cost in lost opportunities for the towns and the cities in the @entity8 and the @entity21			2
' i ’m not prepared to put up with a situation where you can get to @entity149 on a high speed train line but not to @entity31			0
where you can get to @entity153 on high speed trains but not to @entity155			0
to @entity156 but not to @entity34			0
' we can not afford to leave the economic future of our great cities ... to an overcrowded 200 year old railway			0
' conservative mp @entity160 ( @entity161 ) questioned the cost - benefit analysis of the @entity6 project , given the increased costs			1
intervening , she said : ' could you explain what the £ 12.7 billion of contingency will do to the benefit - cost ratio , because certainly during the consultation period , it was always made clear the £ 32 billion was the absolute maximum and contained a vast sum for contingency ? ' mr @entity13 explained : ' i would point out the amount of benefit - cost ratio ( @entity177 ) is reckoned to be 2.5 - i also point that @entity177 does tell us some things but it does n’t tell us everything			1
the government argues the highly controversial @entity6 will help to bridge the @entity21 divide by cutting journey times and fuelling economic growth in the @entity8 and @entity21 ' for instance , @entity177 on the @entity186 ) line was a lot lower than it is for @entity6			0
actually , if the @entity185 had not been developed , a lot of the development we now see down in @entity191 would not have taken place			0
that brought a huge amount of investment into the area and into the country			0
' @entity199 mp @entity198 ( @entity200 ) urged the @entity3 to commit to publishing receipts for expenditure under the @entity83 before @entity12 today			1
the @entity82 ( @entity84 ) @entity83 does not green - light spending on the main project but allowed for ' preparatory expenditure ' by the secretary of state			0
mr @entity13 said he was committed to transparency and parliamentary scrutiny but said he could only look at ms @entity198 ’s request , rather than agree from the outset			0
mr @entity13 said the coalition was considering a number of compensation schemes for residents affected by the planned rail line , including a possible ' property bond '			0
@entity117 businesses would benefit from the projects , he added			0
' on building @entity6 we also need to ensure that we make the best use of @entity117 skills and workers , ' said mr @entity13 , adding that 97per cent of @entity225 contracts had been awarded to @entity117 - based companies			0
he said : ' from 2017 , @entity6 will create 19,000 engineering and construction jobs			0

@entity230 increased to £ 42.6billion and includes large contingency fund
the original budget had been about £ 33billion , @entity3 said
