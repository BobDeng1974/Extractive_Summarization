a former drug addict has helped kickstart @entity2 's newest religious craze - a church where worshippers pretend to get high and worship @entity5 in ' drunken glory '			1
@entity7 preaches to a congregation of thousands via bizarre @entity10 rants , in which he encourages followers to act drunk in order to commune with @entity14			1
the charismatic religious leader insists that ' there 's no high like @entity18 ' - and he has replaced alcohol and crystal meth with snorting frankincense			0
the strange new ' church ' was started in the @entity2 by preacher @entity44 , but has now spread across the @entity45 to @entity46			1
mr @entity44 has travelled the world holding meetings at which worshippers giggle , shout and even writhe on the floor in an apparent state of intoxication			2
' we 've been taught in the church that if it feels bad it 's good , and if it feels good it 's bad - but that 's the opposite of the truth , ' he said			0
' human beings are made for pleasure			0
' watch the documentary : leader : mr @entity7 started taking drugs as a teenager but has since had a religious epiphany home : this is the house in a rundown area of @entity68 where the preacher has set up his ministry surreal : a screen grab of the website where mr @entity7 broadcasts rambling video sermons one of his most prominent converts was mr @entity7 , who started taking drugs as a teenager due to his traumatic childhood			1
he claims he was kidnapped twice by his father following a bitter custody battle between his parents , and lived in 24 different states while growing up			0
the situation became so desperate that his father ended up telling police that @entity7 had attacked him , in an attempt to have him arrested so he would have to stop taking drugs			2
while in rehab mr @entity7 had a religious epiphany , and he then set up @entity89 to promote his message			1
inspiration : the movement was started by @entity44 , pictured , a well - known evangelical preacher experience : the scene at mr @entity44 's meeting in @entity97 , where he encouraged the congregation to act drunk ecstasy : worshippers in @entity97 holding their hands to the air and swaying at mr @entity44 's meeting he took over a former crackhouse in @entity68 , @entity106 and invited followers to move in with him and his wife @entity108			1
' mostly the people who live in our house are ex-druggies , ex-alcoholics , ex-prostitutes , ' mrs @entity109 says - and in the documentary , many of them have the demeanour of people who are high on drugs during the preacher 's sermons			0
in fact , however , the only times they take narcotics are when they snort imaginary cocaine or smoke invisible marijuana			1
mr @entity7 has also replaced his former drug habit with frankincense and ' diamond oil ' , home - made and entirely legal concoctions which he believes help bring him closer to @entity5			0
snorting : mr @entity7 now takes frankincense because of its bilbical associations smoking : one of his followers pretending to toke on a @entity139 figurine like a spliff gathering : mr @entity7 with a number of his followers all pretending to drink and take drugs the priest spreads his message by releasing several videos a week on @entity10 , in which he rants at the camera while his followers cackle with laughter in the background			1
in the @entity36 documentary , he is shown comparing religion to narcotics , saying : ' if you have some really good drugs , you know you do n't keep those to yourself , you got ta find people to do them with , and we 've found the perfect drug - getting high on @entity14			0
' while mr @entity7 's ministry was inspired by mr @entity44 , the two have grown apart following a disagreement about the difference in their preaching			2
trip : the worshippers are pictured at a bowling alley where they acted as it they were intoxicated lounging around : two of mr @entity7 's giggling followers relaxing at his home ' they teach weird stuff , ' mr @entity44 said			1
' like you have sex with @entity5 , like you eat gold dust to make you glow like a lightbulb			0
' i 've just seen a lot of people get caught up in a lot of weird things , and they 've lost their freedom			0
' however , mr @entity7 says that his former mentor is simply envious of his success , and scared of losing his position as leader of the movement			2
and he insists he will not stop at @entity10 videos and a modest house - in the future , he says , he wants to take over a mansion and own his own television channel .			0

@entity7 took drugs as a teenager but had a religious epiphany
now he has taken over a @entity68 crackhouse where he films @entity10 sermons and takes imaginary cocaine with other former addicts
his mentor @entity44 is spreading the ' drunken glory ' to @entity46
the pair have fallen out because @entity44 fears @entity7 is too ' weird '
