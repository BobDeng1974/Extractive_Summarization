by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 07:21 est , 29 october 2012 while @entity3 has focused on huge amounts of explosives or spacecraft on a kamikaze mission to deflect asteroids , @entity2 expert say the reality could be a little simpler - and stranger			0
researchers believe a very pale asteroid would reflect sunlight , and say that over time , this bouncing of photons off its surface could create enough of a force to push the asteroid off its course			1
however , asteroids are made of dark rock - so the team proposed using a large space based paintball gun to coat it with white paint			1
experts have developed several theories to deflect asteroids , the latest being using space launched paintballs to alter their course if timed just right , researchers say pellets full of paint powder , launched in two rounds from a spacecraft at relatively close distance , would cover the front and back of an asteroid			1
this would , more than doubling its reflectivity			2
researchers found the combination of the initial force from the pellets would bump an asteroid off course , and over over time , the sun ’s photons would deflect the asteroid even more			1
however , researchers estimate that it would take up to 20 years for the cumulative effect of solar radiation pressure to successfully pull the asteroid off its @entity54 trajectory			1
@entity55 , a graduate student in @entity57 ’s @entity56 , says if timed just right , pellets full of paint powder , launched in two rounds from a spacecraft at relatively close distance , would cover the front and back of an asteroid , more than doubling its reflectivity , or albedo			1
the initial force from the pellets would bump an asteroid off course ; over time , the sun ’s photons would deflect the asteroid even more			2
@entity55 ’s paper detailing this unconventional strategy won the 2012 move an @entity70 , sponsored by the @entity71 ’ @entity72 , which solicits creative solutions to space - related problems from students and young professionals			1
@entity55 presented his paper this month at the @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80			0
the challenge put forth by this year ’s @entity71 competition was to identify novel solutions for safely deflecting a near - @entity85 object , such as an asteroid			1
scientists have proposed a wide variety of methods to avoid an asteroid collision			2
some proposals launch a projectile or spacecraft to collide with an incoming asteroid ; the @entity95 is currently investigating such a mission			2
other methods have included detonating a nuclear bomb near an asteroid or equipping spacecraft as ' gravity tractors , ' using a craft ’s gravitational field to pull an asteroid off its path			2
@entity55 ’s paintball strategy builds on a solution submitted by last year ’s competition winner , who proposed deflecting an asteroid with a cloud of solid pellets			2
@entity55 came up with a similar proposal , adding paint to the pellets to take advantage of solar radiation pressure — the force exerted on objects by the sun ’s photons			0
the unique idea would use a space based version of a paintball gun to fire pellets at an asteroid researchers have observed that pressure from sunlight can alter the orbits of geosynchronous satellites , while others have proposed equipping spacecraft with sails to catch solar radiation , much like a sailboat catches wind			1
in his proposal , @entity55 used the asteroid @entity138 as a theoretical test case			0
according to astronomical observations , this 27 - gigaton rock may come close to @entity85 in 2029 , and then again in 2036			0
@entity55 determined that five tons of paint would be required to cover the massive asteroid , which has a diameter of 1,480 feet			1
he used the asteroid ’s period of rotation to determine the timing of pellets , launching a first round to cover the front of the asteroid , and firing a second round once the asteroid ’s backside is exposed			0
as the pellets hit the asteroid ’s surface , they would burst apart , splattering the space rock with a fine , five - micrometer - layer of paint			1
from his calculations , @entity55 estimates that it would take up to 20 years for the cumulative effect of solar radiation pressure to successfully pull the asteroid off its @entity54 trajectory			0
he says launching pellets with traditional rockets may not be an ideal option , as the violent takeoff may rupture the payload			0
instead , he envisions paintballs may be made in space , in ports such as the @entity176 , where a spacecraft could then pick up a couple of rounds of pellets to deliver to the asteroid			0
@entity55 adds that paint is n’t the only substance that such pellets might hold			0
for instance , the capsules could be filled with aerosols that , when fired at an asteroid , ' impart air drag on the incoming asteroid to slow it down , ' @entity55 says			0
' or you could just paint the asteroid so you can track it more easily with telescopes on @entity85			1
' so there are other uses for this method			0
' computer generated simulation shows an asteroid striking the @entity85 - something the new research could avoid			0

@entity57 researchers found that coating asteroid in paint could affect its reflectivity , altering its course
