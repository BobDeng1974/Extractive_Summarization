@entity0 was handed the chance to take a massive leap from the periphery of @entity5 's one - day squad on sunday to become their @entity7 opener in place of @entity9			1
@entity10 , the new @entity5 one - day captain , confirmed here in @entity12 that it is the veteran @entity0 who will be given the first opportunity to claim @entity9 's place ahead of the more expansive @entity17 when @entity5 begin a one - day tour that will culminate with the @entity7 here next month			1
@entity0 , who averaged 45 in 38 matches as @entity9 's opening partner over the last two years , will open in sunday night 's first warm - up game ahead of a triangular series against @entity24 and @entity25 here against a @entity28 team along with @entity29			1
@entity0 looks set to open the batting for @entity5 with @entity29 at the @entity7 in february @entity0 chats to @entity5 batting coach @entity31 during saturday 's nets session in @entity12 @entity0 partnered @entity29 in a practice match on saturday , giving the clearest indication yet that the pair will open ' the top three in the first game will be @entity29 , @entity0 and @entity38 , ' said @entity10 ahead of his first match officially in charge			1
' the first opportunity goes to those guys			2
all three look in great form			0
opportunity lands with them and we 'll see how they go			0
' there will be disappointment among many supporters who want @entity5 to replicate the aggressive cricket seen more readily among one - day opponents and are hoping that @entity9 's sacking would provide a prolonged chance for @entity17			1
but @entity10 clearly echoes the view of the @entity5 coaches who want to marry experience with the younger more explosive talents in the @entity5 top order and are simply replacing the out of form @entity9 with @entity0			1
' belly is a class act , somebody we 've looked to for a long time to score a heavy weight of runs , ' said @entity10			1
' he 's pretty key at the top of the order			0
' @entity10 was appointed captain in a last - gasp move by the selectors when @entity9 ran out of chances to regain the form which he displayed in one - day cricket when he first took over from @entity75			1
@entity0 's one - day career had looked in jeopardy but he was given a late reprieve after @entity9 's sacking ' it 's been interesting , ' said the @entity81 of his early days at the helm			1
' it took a bit if time to settle in but it 's a huge honour to captain your country running into a @entity7			2
it 's a massive opportunity given the side we have , which is brilliant			2
it 's great to finally get started			0
' cookie was the first person to message me once i got the news , which sums up the guy			0
i 've had a great relationship with @entity9 over the last number of years when he 's been captain			1
he 's been fantastic to me			0
it is unfortunate the way it ended but it is the decision that 's been made			0
' @entity10 does not believe there will be a great change in captaincy style			2
' i do n't think it will differ in a huge amount , ' he insisted			0
' there will be certain things @entity9 will do that i would n't just because it is his character and mine			2
' when i 've captained in the past i 've tended to strip things back to the basics keep things as relaxed as possible because things can conjure up into high - pressure situations and you want guys to be at their best when they make decisions			0
@entity123 ( right ) is in a battle with @entity125 and @entity126 to be @entity5 's third seamer @entity128 ( right ) and @entity129 are certain to take two positions leaving one more up for grabs ' over the last seven or eight months i think we 've seen a considerable change in the method that we 've used both batting and bowling			0
that will continue to go in the same direction and guys will be encouraged to play with freedom			0
' @entity142 's offer to play against @entity5 for the @entity145 prime minister 's @entity143 in wednesday 's second warm - up game , presumably made tongue in cheek , was officially dashed on saturday when @entity149 was called up to replace the injured @entity150			1
@entity142 made his offer while playing for @entity152 in the @entity153 and @entity10 added : ' i think it was a very ambitious offer			2
it 's a hugely prestigious game , for the prime minister 's xi to give an opportunity to somebody who is not @entity145 is pretty ambitious			1
' when sides tour @entity5 and we put out @entity162 teams we give opportunities to our youngest and best			0
i do n't think it would have spiced up the game at all if @entity165 had played			0
it does n't really bother me			0
' @entity166 one - day captain @entity10 ( left ) does not believe there will be a big change in captaincy style @entity10 confirmed in @entity12 it is the veteran @entity0 who will be given the first opportunity to claim @entity9 's place			1

@entity166 one - day captain @entity10 confirms in @entity12 that @entity0 will be given the first opportunity to claim @entity9 's place
@entity0 averaged 45 in 38 matches as @entity9 's opening partner over two years
@entity0 will open in sunday night 's first warm - up game
