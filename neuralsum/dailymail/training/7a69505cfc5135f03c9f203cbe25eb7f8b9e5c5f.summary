in an apparent sign that the family were attempting to return to normality after their embarrassment , @entity11 , 18 , climbed into her car to head to school on thursday while her mother @entity19 climbed into a separate vehicle			1
they were followed by her father @entity22 and a younger sibling			2
@entity11 returned to the @entity25 home with her tail between her legs on tuesday night after a judge took a very dim view of her lawsuit demanding her parents pay child support , college tuition and other expenses last week			1
her parents had claimed that their daughter ran off in october to stay with friends because she refused to abide by rules they had put in place , including to stop dating her boyfriend			2
last week , the judge said @entity11 had given her mom and dad , @entity22 : ‘ the proverbial f you ’			1
' have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent ? i do n’t see it in my house , ' family division judge @entity68 said			1
he also warned he must consider the ' slippery slope ' where ' we open the gates for a 12 - year - old to sue for an @entity76 , a 13 - year - old to sue for an @entity77 … what about a 15 - year - old asking for a 60 inch tv ? ' ' happy families ' : the @entity49 family headed out for the school run on thursday morning school run : @entity11 's father , @entity22 , and sister headed out from the home separately on thursday morning stress : the judge who dismissed the case said the ordeal had affected her younger siblings back to the books : @entity11 also requested a legal guardian following the case - but it was denied despite the mother and daughter 's attempt at playing happy families on thursday , @entity11 's attorney had requested a court - appointed legal guardian for the girl - which was promptly denied			1
' just a few days ago , @entity11 indicated she could not go back home with her parents and she required a promise of some financial assistance going forward , ' attorney @entity104 wrote			1
' now , after speaking with her mother yesterday , she said she is waiving her complaint and is receiving no promises or consideration in return			0
' but she said @entity19 and @entity49 should now be responsible for paying for a legal guardian for their daughter , who had branded her parents abusive , the @entity114 reported			1
' a psychologist certified that the parents are abusive			0
school faculty certified that the parents abuse the child , ' @entity104 wrote			2
reconciliation : @entity11 has apparently come to her senses and returned to her parents ' home after their very public falling out after she took them to court to pay for her when she ran away back home : @entity11 's parents have welcomed her back to their @entity128 , @entity4 home ( pictured last week ) but family division judge @entity68 - last week refused an emergency order to require the couple to pay - denied the application			1
on wednesday afternoon , the lawyer representing @entity11 's parents held a press conference confirming that the family was reunited on tuesday evening , but would not say what had sparked it			1
' my clients will be known for this for quite some time ... as far as my clients are concerned it 's over , it 's done , ' attorney @entity140 said			0
' @entity143 's back home			2
' ' this is a long process , it 's only the beginning , ' he said according to the @entity148			0
' this is a private matter			0
it should have never been brought to the court 's attention			0
it should have never been brought to the public			0
' mr @entity140 added that the family wishes for the matter to remain private from now on , but felt the pressure to address their reunion in case it came out later			0
speaking out : @entity140 , the attorney who represented @entity161 and mrs @entity11 in the ordeal , spoke about the reunion wednesday at a press conference welcoming her back : @entity19 and @entity49 , seen during the court hearing , have apparently reached a settlement with their daughter but her lawyer said that no financial incentive was given ' her return home is not contingent on any financial and / or other considerations , ' mr @entity140 said in an earlier statement released wednesday			1
' they 're not athletes , they 're not actors			0
they did n't ask for this attention ... please respect the @entity181 's privacy			0
it 's ancient history , it 's done ... this is a happy situation			0
' he said that while they are happy that it is now resolved , their two other children have been affected			0
' nothing good can come from this , ' mr @entity140 said			0
the ordeal is not entirely over , however , as the judge scheduled an april court date to consider the over-arching question of whether the @entity196 are obligated to financially support their adult daughter			0
judge @entity68 read an expletive - laden and vicious voice message left by @entity11 to her mother , in which she said : ' i wan na s * * * all over your face '			1
' spoiled ' : the judge in her case was one of @entity11 's most vocal critics asking how it had come to this emotional : both @entity22 and @entity209 began crying in the courtroom as their lawyers defended their actions , explaining that they had to enforce their rules with their often rebellious child in shocking legal documents submitted to the court , the honor - roll student said her parents ’ behavior contributed to her developing an eating disorder at a young age and saw her weight plummet down to 92 pounds			1
she also said that her father had an ' inappropriate affection ' for her			0
a @entity227 investigation cleared mr @entity49 of any claims of abuse , with @entity11 's parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion she was just ' spoiled '			1
but she argued that since her parents have a combined yearly income of between $ 250,000 and $ 300,000 and she is entitled to $ 654 - a - week in child support			0
her parents have also refused to pay $ 6,000 owed in school fees for her @entity237			2
her parents claim their daughter ran off to stay with friends when she turned 18 because she refused to abide by rules they had set down , including to stop dating her boyfriend			2
friend in some kind of need : @entity11 was seen with her friend @entity246 , whose family took her in and paid for her legal fees starring each other down : @entity49 and @entity11 exchange tense glances during their day in court but the judge clearly took a dim view of the lawsuit			1
he said : ' what kind of parents would the @entity196 be if they did n’t try to set down some strict rules ? ' i 'm not going to put myself in anyone 's shoes , he 's ( father @entity22 ) trying to raise a child			2
it 's clear to me all the positive qualities @entity11 obviously has , in terms of sports and academics , but i ’m not going to step on a father for how he tries to get his child on the right tracks when she has obviously come off the tracks , to put it mildly			1
' when summing up later he denied all immediate financial claims , including monthly maintenance , private school payments and legal fees			2
through the hearings , it was revealed that she previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the @entity282 dance because he thought she was drunk			0
trying to excuse the suit : the 18 - year - old has offers to attend several colleges and is an accomplished cheerleader and lacrosse player who hopes to one day be a biomedical engineer princess : @entity11 even accused her mother of being the cause of her bulimia , claiming that mrs @entity11 had called her ' porky ' and ' fat '			1
mrs @entity49 because she tried to help , @entity11 developed a ' hatred ' towards her bragging : @entity11 was heard bragging by teachers that she had a bottle of @entity300			2
they searched her car , did n't find any and the teacher who hauled her into an office was convinced she was drunk senior tutor @entity306 spotted @entity11 out in the parking lot with a group of boys – including her boyfriend @entity310 – and thought they were acting suspiciously			2
earlier in the evening @entity143 , now 18 , had apparently been heard loudly boasting that she had @entity300 , a brand of vodka			0
her pleas for immediate financial assistance were denied in a hearing at @entity317 on tuesday , but judge @entity68 set a trial date for april 22			1
@entity11 ’s controversial legal battle is being funded by the father of her best friend , millionaire lawyer @entity321			1
the @entity196 believe he is enabling their daughter 's behavior and encouraging her to take the matter to court			0
throughout the trial , she was living in her friend 's large mansion in @entity329 , @entity4 .			0

the parent 's lawyer said that it was ' not contingent on financial considerations ' and that her younger siblings were affected by the case
@entity11 , 18 , had sued her parents for money to pay for tuition after moving out and accusing them of verbal abuse and *sexual* *inappropriateness*
