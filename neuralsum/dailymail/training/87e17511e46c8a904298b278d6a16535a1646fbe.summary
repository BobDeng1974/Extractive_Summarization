the @entity0 approved a proposal by one of the largest real estate developers in the city to build in a ' poor door ' , or a separate door for residents living in affordable housing to enter their building			1

another 219 units will face the river			0
a spokesman for the @entity60 confirmed that the agency had approved @entity14 ’s application for the @entity45			1
despite the approval of this application , the @entity12 reports that @entity66 president @entity65 vowed to reject future developments with separate entrances			2
