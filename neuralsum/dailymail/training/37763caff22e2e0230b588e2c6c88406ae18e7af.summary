by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 3 may 2013 the failure of the @entity3 to reform hardened criminals was exposed last night in official figures			1
more than 200,000 offences including burglary and robbery were committed last year by criminals who had previously been under probation supervision			1
@entity11 said the figures exposed the ' @entity13 ' of crime and pledged to improve rehabilitation of offenders			1
the justice secretary is expected to announce radical plans within days which would see private companies and charities taking over probation services			1
more than 200,000 offences were committed by criminals who had already gone through the system it is expected that firms will be given cash incentives if they are able to help criminals turn their lives away from crime			1
mr @entity11 said : ' these figures just go to show the depressing @entity32 of crime and re-offending			1
reoffending rates have barely changed in a decade , and it 's clear we need to do things differently			0
' i 'm going to be setting out soon the government 's plans for how we intend to do just that , by better rehabilitating offenders so that they do n't just carry on committing crimes and leaving more victims in their wake			2
' @entity11 during a visit to @entity48			2
the justice secretary has condemned the figures in the year to september 2012 , some 208,699 crimes were carried out by criminals who had previously been supervised by the @entity3			1
the offences included 69,000 violent crimes , 4,300 robberies and more than 20,000 burglaries			2
they also committed more than 10,000 sex crimes , and 45,000 theft offences			0
currently probation officers handle all offenders after their release on licence who have served a year or more in jail			0
mr @entity11 is set to extend this to those serving less than a year			1
the @entity69 ' union , @entity70 , has condemned the plan , which will see large swathes of its work outsourced			0
it says it will lead to the effective demise of the 105 - year - old service			0
it also argues the moves could pose a risk to public safety			0
serious violent and sexual offenders and those who pose the highest risk to the public will remain under control of the @entity86			0
@entity87 , director of the @entity89 think tank said : ' by the time criminals go to prison they 've usually committed a string of serious offences			2
so it 's no surprise the probation service is failing to wave a magic wand and completely change hardened criminals			2
' ' what does work is tougher sentencing			0
too many politicians are unwilling to consider longer prison terms but they protect the public for longer and have much lower reoffending rates			0
