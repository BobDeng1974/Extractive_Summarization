a college student from @entity1 was waiting for @entity2 to deliver some weightlifting equipment he had ordered - but instead he received a government drone			1
the shocking discovery was made monday by @entity8 user @entity6 , who promptly took to the online forum to share photos of what he found inside the @entity2 parcel			1
the box delivered to the engineering student 's doorstep contained wings , a control panel and a card stating that the items were federal property and should be returned to a @entity24 ( @entity24 ) office at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
special delivery : an unsuspecting college student got a @entity2 delivery containing a @entity32 drone , which was property of the federal government incomplete set : the box was one of eight containers carrying parts of the drone used for environmental observation pricey video game : the parcel contained a control panel used to operate the drone from the ground the box came with this card explaining that it was federal property that came from a @entity24 office at @entity25 ' i think i just got a drone in the mail			1
' the unsuspecting recipient wrote in a @entity8 post that quickly went viral			0
when the student called @entity2 about the package , he was allegedly told that because his name and address were on the box containing the equipment , the drone was his to keep , if he so chose			2
‘ in all fairness , the @entity2 guy that delivered it said it was part 2 of my package , so i genuinely thought at first , that it was part of the weight lifting bench set i ordered , ’ the student said			2
‘ not sure if that will protect me from the government though			0
’ another @entity8 user , who described himself as an @entity75 war veteran , identified the drone as a @entity32 unmanned aerial vehicle , @entity72 reported			1
the soldier said the @entity24 drone features high - definition thermal camera , a range of nearly 13 miles , and if handled improperly , its rotors could easily cut off a finger			2
‘ the thing will take a beating ! ’ the soldier wrote			0
‘ do n't play chicken with this thing , i 've seen one go half way through a car door			0
’ when fully assembled , a @entity32 unmanned aircraft like the one seen in this picture is worth about $ 350,000 @entity24 spokesman @entity93 later confirmed that the machinery that was mistakenly brought to the home of the college student was indeed a @entity32 drone worth about $ 350,000 when fully assembled , which had been shipped in an eight - box set from @entity26 to @entity99 in @entity100			1
but somewhere en route from @entity27 to @entity100 , one of the boxes containing drone parts allegedly got mislabeled and went missing			2
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity105 has released a statement confirming the delivery snafu			0
she added that the shipping company , which delivers nearly 17million parcels each day , was working to recover the drone from the @entity8 user and ship it to the sanctuary as intended			2
@entity105 said she suspects a label became displaced from a package ordered by the student and wound up on the @entity24 box shipped out last thursday			1
@entity2 is still investigating exactly what happened to the package			0
@entity6 has revealed himself as somewhat of a drone enthusiast , calling them an ' awesome tool			0
' he told the @entity122 that he was especially eager to return the unmanned aircraft to @entity24 because it was meant to be used in the observation of marine life and migratory birds			2
point of departure : the $ 350,000 unmanned aircraft was shipped in eight boxes from @entity25 in @entity26 last week mistaken identity : @entity2 says that the name and address label from a box containing the student 's weightlifting bench may have somehow ended up on the box containing the drone on tuesday night , @entity2 staff reportedly picked up the box with the @entity32 wings and control console , and it is said to be on its way to the @entity100 nature preserve now			1
according to @entity24 , the @entity32 drone is a ‘ flying camera ’ that researchers use to ‘ spy on nature , ’ the @entity144 reported			1
the hand - launched aircraft comes with 5 - foot wingspans , a 5 - megapixel camera and can fly for two hours at speeds up to 55mph and altitudes up to 10,000 feet , according to @entity154			0
the @entity8 user admitted that he should not have posted photos of the drone online before contacting @entity24 , and said he was glad the situation was resolved without him being led away in handcuffs , or ‘ dead , ’ as he wrote half - jokingly in response to other users ’ quips			1
‘ generally , i was an idiot , ’ the student wrote			0
‘ but i 'm a lucky idiot , who currently is n't serving jail time			0
even so , i really do n't think hypersensitive government equipment would be shipped through @entity2 , let alone get delivered to a civilian			0

@entity8 user @entity6 , an engineering student from @entity1 , got a @entity2 box with his address containing drone *blades* and control panel

@entity2 suspects a label from a box containing student 's weightlifting bench somehow wound up on the drone package
