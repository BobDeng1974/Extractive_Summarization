by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 21:40 est , 11 february 2013 @entity2 's former executioner who put 62 people to death over a 17 - year career has now become the state 's most vocal opponent of the death penalty			1
@entity9 , who carried out executions until 1999 , began speaking out against the practice after he came within hours of putting an innocent man to death - and after he himself ended up in jail for a crime he says he did not commit			1
he now believes that the death penalty is at odds with his religious convictions , and notes that the crime rate in his state actually went up when the death penalty was re-introduced in 1976			1
' from the 62 lives i took , i learned a lot , ' he told the @entity26			0
a changed man : @entity9 , pictured , was once the state executioner in @entity2 and put 62 people to death over 17 years			1
he now vehemently opposes the death penalty @entity9 started working as a @entity30 after losing his job at a tobacco factory and in 1976 , before @entity2 re-instated the death penalty , he was asked to join the ' @entity34 '			1
even though the job did not pay more , he agreed to join as he vehemently believed those who killed deserved to die			1
when he was 14 , he had witnessed a man break into a party and randomly shoot a teenage girl dead - and in the subsequent years , he would think of this killing before he carried out an execution			1
he also reasoned that because murderers knew there was a death penalty in the state , he was not committing homicide			1
' i could consider those people on death row as a suicide , ' he told the @entity51			2
old life : @entity9 is pictured left after he joined the @entity53 in the 1970s killing machine : @entity9 shows the electric chair system that was used to execute inmates before @entity2 started using lethal injection			1
he executed 37 people by electric chair over the next 17 years , he executed 37 @entity61 inmates by electric chair and 25 by lethal injection - although he had no formal medical training			2
his first execution was in 1984 , when he put @entity66 - one of three brothers who carried out a seven - month killing spree in @entity69 in 1979 - to death			2
before the death , @entity9 prayed with @entity66 and then focused on the mechanics of the execution			1
but that night , he could not sleep			0
' you are not going to feel happy , ' he told the @entity26			0
' you feel for the condemned man ’s family and the victim ’s family			2
you have two sets of families that are losing someone			0
' but @entity9 went on to become one of the nation 's most prolific executioners ; the 62 men he put to death accounted for around 11 per cent of all the people executed across the country in those years			1
secret life : @entity9 , pictured left with fellow guards , kept his job secret from his wife for 20 years workplace : he worked at the @entity96 in @entity69 , pictured , which has since closed since the death penalty was re-instated in the @entity99 in 1976 , the state has put more people to death than any other state , besides @entity103			1
a total of 110 inmates , who were all convicted of capital murder , have been executed since 1982			1
( @entity103 has executed 491			0
) but statistics reveal there has been less support for the death penalty in @entity2 in recent years			1
it has had fewer death sentences in the past five years than any period since the 1970s			1
@entity114 , who was executed on january 16 after asking to die so that he would not kill again , was the first execution in 18 months			2
this is compared with 1999 , when the state put 13 people to death in a single year			1
in recent years , as the death penalty has become less of a key political issue , prosecutors have felt less pressure to recommend death penalties			1
instead , the state has brought in sentences of life without parole , giving juries and prosecutors a different option			2
the number of death sentences across the country reached record lows in 2011 and 2012 - down 75 per cent since 1996 , according to the @entity136			2
five states have outlawed capital punishment in the past five years : @entity139 ( 2012 ) , @entity140 ( 2011 ) , @entity141 ( 2009 ) , @entity142 ( 2007 ) and @entity143 ( 2007 )			2
in that time he kept his job a secret from his loved ones			2
for 20 years , even his wife was unaware that she was living with a professional killer			1
yet despite his belief that murderers knew what they were getting themselves into , he said ' crime went up '			2
his belief in the justice system was also shaken when he came within hours of putting an innocent man to death in 1985			1
@entity158 was sentenced to death after admitting to the rape and murder of a 19 - year - old mother			2
but he had an iq of 69 and in police interviews , many of his answers failed to match up with the facts of the case			0
just days before he was due to be executed , lawyers secured a stay based on doubts about his part in the killing and in 1993 , dna evidence confirmed he was not the killer			0
he was eventually cleared and pardoned , making him the first person on @entity2 's death row to be exonerated by dna evidence			0
' if i execute an innocent person , i ’m no better than the people on death row , ' @entity9 told the @entity26			1
he added that he wondered how many of the men he killed were innocent , and blamed the justice system and its juries for allowing it to happen			1
' you 're the @entity99 people , ' he told @entity191			0
' you sentenced a guy to be executed			0
you give him a trial , then you send him to me to be put to death			0
' then later on you [ say ] that this guy was innocent			0
you did n't put him to death			0
so you might suffer a little			0
i 'm going to suffer a lot , because i performed the job			0
' despite his reservations , he continued to work as @entity2 's chief executioner into the 1990s and rose to the rank of captain in the @entity53			0
inmates : @entity9 ' first execution was of @entity66 , left , in 1984 for a string of brutal murders in @entity69			2
@entity9 also came within hours of executing @entity158 , right , who was later found to be innocent fears : @entity9 , pictured with images of his family , said he wonders how many innocent people he killed but in 1999 , he was charged with money laundering and lying to a federal grand jury ; authorities said he bought a car with a friend knowing that the funds came from drug dealing			1
@entity9 , who maintains his innocence , was convicted and forced to resign - and his distrust in the justice system was confirmed			1
he spent four years behind bars and immersed himself in the @entity225			0
he soon realised that what he had done as executioner was not compatible with @entity229 ' teachings of forgiveness			0
' this was @entity232 ’s way of waking me up , ' he said			0
he does not regret his former work as he believes @entity232 put him in the role for a purpose , and took it away for a purpose			0
' @entity232 said do n't worry you go out and save souls			0
you took 62 but you can save millions , ' he said			0
last view : an electric chair stands in front of the witness box in the basement of the @entity96 in @entity69 in august 1982 after the state reintroduced the death penalty after his release in 2004 , he found work as a truck driver and started attending @entity251 for @entity253 meetings			1
he joined their board in 2009 and started delivering speeches across the country about his experience and his new outlook on the death penalty			0
in 2010 , he gave an emotional testimony at a state legislative hearing on a bill seeking to extend the death penalty to accomplices in murders - and he helped to defeat it			2
' the people who pass these bills , they do n't have to do it , ' he said after the hearing			0
' the people who do the executions , they 're the ones who suffer through it			0

@entity9 served as state executioner from 1982 until 1999
he kept his job hidden from his wife for 20 years
accepted the job as he believed killers deserved to die , but his opinion changed when he came within hours of putting an innocent man to death
when he was himself convicted for a crime he says he did not commit , he lost complete faith in the system
