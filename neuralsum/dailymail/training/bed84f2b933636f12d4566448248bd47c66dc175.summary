the discovery has triggered a debate about whether it should now go on show in tribute to @entity16 , 21 , her brother @entity17 and other members of the @entity20 resistance group			1
after @entity10 rose to power he decreed that so - called traitors and other opponents of his regime should be executed and ordered the construction of 20 guillotines , more usually associated with revolutionary era @entity28			0
the device used to kill the @entity31 was found in the basement of the @entity33 in @entity34			1
back in 1943 @entity16 and @entity17 , 24 , were distributing anti-war leaflets at the @entity36 when they were caught by the custodian , @entity37 , who informed the @entity38			1
