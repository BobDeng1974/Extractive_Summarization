if @entity1 truly is past it , then @entity0 must have felt like he stepped into a time machine and travelled back a few years last night			1
by the end of the first game , the 23 - year - old had already seen his huge serve broken			1
by the end of the second set he looked like a broken man			1
thirty - three minutes later he was out of the gentleman ’s singles , the uprising of youth obliterated by one of the oldest swingers in town			2
what happens next , in a @entity18 final against @entity19 , remains to be seen for a man one month shy of his 33rd birthday			1
what can be in no doubt is that those directing @entity1 towards pasture will need to take a break			1
perhaps they need a lie down			2
a record eighth title here , a notion that seemed increasingly implausible this time a year ago , is now one match away			2
‘ i 'm unbelievably thrilled to be in another final , ’ he said			1
‘ i was very pleased the way i played because it was always going to be a difficult match against @entity0			1
‘ the fun for me is being able to do it , at this age , with a family , with the team i have			2
we have a great relationship			2
i know so many people over time now on the tour , so being here , doing this , is something i really , really enjoy			2
‘ i am extremely happy			2
i will try to enjoy it as much as i can			2
the first final was special in 2003 and it has been a thrill ever since			1
to get another chance is great			2
@entity19 and i have had many great matches			1
’ if his win yesterday , and indeed his wider revival in 2014 , proved anything it is that while the old back might not be what it once was , the maestro with four children in tow can still play a handy tune			1
record : @entity1 admitted winning @entity18 for an eighth time would top his career achievements down low : @entity0 attempts to return to @entity1 during the pair 's semi-final clash star : @entity85 actor @entity84 ( centre ) was in the royal box to enjoy the men 's semi-finals on friday of course , the obituaries were premature in the extreme and , by extension , a measure of context is needed when rating the scale of his comeback this year			1
by his own admission , 2013 was ‘ difficult ’ ; woeful in the minds of most who saw some of the defeats			0
he had a serious back injury and his lowest haul of titles since 2001 – one			0
his ranking fell to eighth			0
worse still , in the two years since he won here there has been a spreading of the opinion that the mounting losses would damage his legacy			0
a ludicrous sentiment but a popular one			0
‘ i do n't even remember when my last @entity37 final was , ’ @entity1 joked last night			1
certainly , this is no fairytale			0
he has been too good for too long to count as a true outsider , particular with grass under his feet			0
but it is an astonishing achievement and one given greater stature by the numbers that show only eight slams have been won by fathers since 1990			0
none have been won in that time by a father of four			0
victory : federer waves to fans and acknowledges their support on @entity133 respect : the pair shake hands following @entity1 's semi-final victory on friday evening down : @entity0 takes a tumble during the semi-final defeat out on @entity133 then again , @entity1 is the man who has made an estimated fortune of £ 140million by breaking records			1
yesterday he took a step to more by breaking serves			0
this was a win that owed much to experience and a keen sense for when @entity0 was vulnerable			1
at the slightest sign of weakness , @entity1 ran away with the game			1
his three breaks of serve – twice to 15 points and once to 30 – were notable against a man broken only twice in five previous matches			0
the first break came in the opening game			0
@entity0 walked with his head down to the chair , picking at his strings ; @entity1 strutted , brushing back his hair , calmness personified			1
he never looked back in taking the opening set 6 - 4 in 34 minutes			0
at that point , there were no smiles , unlike thursday when he traded high - fives with some of the hundreds who watched him practice on @entity169			0
there was simply that single fist salute so familiar to those who saw him dominate this competition for a decade			0
there was another when he broke at 4 - 4 in the second and at the same stage in the third			0
@entity0 , close to the front of the ‘ new wave ’ of men ’s tennis , was left shaking his head			1
‘ @entity1 is the guy that 's done a lot of things that do n't seem possible , ’ he said			1
‘ a lot of people could have , and have , written him off in a lot of ways			0
but you knew he was capable of this run			0
’ it ’s not over yet .			0

@entity1 through to @entity18 2014 final after straight sets win against @entity0
@entity196 star will play no 1 seed @entity19 in the final on *sunday*
