@entity7 of the @entity8 needed more than 15 helpers to drag the giant sea creature with eyes the size of half dollars to shore on sunday			1
staffers at the institute are calling it the discovery of a lifetime			0
' the last oarfish we saw was three feet long			1
' because oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep , sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied , according to @entity8			2
the obscure fish apparently died of natural causes			0
tissue samples and video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the @entity38 , @entity38			0
science instructor @entity39 spotted something shimmering about 30 feet deep while snorkeling during a staff trip in @entity43 at @entity23 , about two dozen miles from the mainland			1
an illustration of @entity47 's @entity46 , circa 1850 , the giant fish that inspired tales of sea serpents			2

the longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet , however , the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds			1
like the equally mysterious giant squid , the oarfish would go on to enchant fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters			2

' i am pushing to bury it and wait for it to be naturally cleaned so that we can then take the skeleton and articulate it and have it on display , ' said @entity27			0
' that is what i hope will happen .			0
