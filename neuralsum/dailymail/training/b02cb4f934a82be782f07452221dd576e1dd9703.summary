a luxury interior design shop has sparked outrage by advertising six full - time jobs which did not pay a penny in wages – and claiming more than 150 people still applied			1
campaigners have reported the 35 - hour - a - week ‘ internships ’ at @entity10 ’s @entity9 boutique , which sells £ 400 lights , £ 500 cowhide rugs and £ 200 stone ornaments , to government investigators amid concerns they may have been illegal			1
yet the firm ’s founder insisted the hours were fair because ‘ we all have 168 hours every week ’ – including the ones in which people sleep - and attacked the ' hypocrites ' who exposed her scheme			1
campaigners reported the adverts on @entity32 to @entity33 the six placements , each six months long and requiring the ‘ employees ’ to work 35 hours a week for free , were advertised last month on the classified adverts site @entity32			1
three of the employees would have worked from home while the other three would work from a rota which involved starting at 9am , five days a week			2
the only expenses to be paid were for travel , despite the interns designing products , drawing up technical plans and meeting suppliers and tradesmen			2
if all 5,460 hours of work were paid for at the minimum wage for over- 21s , they would total more than £ 34,000			1
the adverts were first spotted by @entity10 - based artist @entity54 , who wrote to complain – but claimed he received an ‘ eye - wateringly rude ’ reply from the firm ’s founder @entity56			1
shocking : the adverts on @entity32 , which have since been taken down , said candidates would start at 9am for five days a week and work full - time for six months without any pay			1
the internships are no longer on offer posting the exchange on @entity65 , he said she wrote : ‘ i fully expect you to proof [ sic ] to me that you can actually be an asset to my business before i invest seriously in you with a full time contract			0
‘ i deliberately place unpaid intern positions precisely to sort out the mediocre ( you ) who will never apply , from the formidable			0
‘ you will never go far with your present mindset			0
150 cvs now in , from as far as @entity79 , and counting			0
’ when contacted by a student newspaper in @entity10 , ms @entity56 insisted her employment practices were not illegal or immoral			1
she initially told the student : ‘ we do n’t believe that working 35 hours per week does in any form disadvantage students from poorer backgrounds because we all have universal access to 168 hours in every week of the year			1
' upmarket : the boutique , which sells £ 400 lights and £ 500 cowhide rugs , defended its decision on @entity65 her comments sparked a ferocious backlash on @entity65 and the adverts were later removed			1
the firm said the internships would no longer be offered , adding : ' should we wish to explore them at all , it will be within the realm of university established graduate work experience programmes , under their terms and conditions , to avoid any further misunderstandings , offence or outrage			1
' but ms @entity56 defended her logic - and attacked the ' hypocritical ' students who exposed it			2
she claimed ' the cvs keep coming ' , telling @entity113 : ' we were merely responding to students , graduates and universities increasing demand for voluntary work experience internships , which must be , by the university 's own terms , necessarily full time and six months , since internships are now compulsory in many university degrees throughout @entity124			2
' hence the hypocrisy in the story			0
the same students who have been outraged by @entity9 will be complaining to their universities about the lack of internship opportunities in the market , and pressing for closer collaboration between university and employers			2
' @entity135 , the president of @entity137 's @entity136 , condemned the adverts			0
he told @entity113 : ' even worse than offering up these positions which are clearly full - time jobs , and borders on illegal practice , is the downright patronising response from the company involved			2
tall order : the adverts asked for people who were already highly proficient with graphic design software last year the government launched a clampdown on top firms who were using unpaid interns to fill jobs			0
officials wrote to 200 firms – some of which were believed to include household names – which could be fined , ‘ named and shamed ’ and even prosecuted if they were failing to pay workers the national minimum wage			0
the @entity162 announced the new crackdown amid fears that interns are being exploited and made to work for free in effectively full - time , paid occupations			2
employment minister @entity167 ( above ) said : ‘ far too many young people have been exploited on long - term unpaid internships			2
anyone who is a worker is entitled to be paid at least the minimum wage , including if they are an intern			0
’ ' students work incredibly hard for their degrees , and make an invaluable contribution to all sorts of employers and organisations once they ’ve graduated			0
' to denigrate all those who , quite rightly , refuse to work a full - time job for no pay , is simply offensive			0
' the campaign group @entity182 has reported the adverts to @entity33 , which will be duty - bound to investigate whether they are illegal			1
campaigns manager @entity185 told @entity113 : ' unless you meet one of a small number of exemptions ( such as a charity ) then if you ’re doing real work , you should be paid for it			0
' so if you ’re expected to work full - time , have set responsibilities and are contributing value to the employer ’s business , it ’s highly likely that you qualify as at least a " worker " and have a right to at least minimum wage			0
' in this case , there are a long list of duties and responsibilities for each position so we have reported these adverts to @entity33 for investigation as they potentially breach the law			1
the group is pushing for a change in the law so all unpaid internships longer than four weeks would be automatically illegal			0
mr @entity185 added : ' at the moment , the law just is n’t clear enough to help businesses or interns get this right			0
' an @entity33 spokesman told @entity113 : ' we look into every allegation that 's passed to us , but we ca n't comment on individual cases			1
