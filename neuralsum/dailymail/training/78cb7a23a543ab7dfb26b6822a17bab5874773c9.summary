by @entity0 a summer that has belonged to @entity2 can reach another benchmark at the @entity4 this week			2
never before have @entity2 golfers won three majors in a row but who would bet against @entity9 or one of his gifted cohorts seizing the @entity4 and completing a glorious triumvirate in the space of just nine weeks ? it ’s all rather ironic , of course , that it could happen here at @entity16 , the place where so many bathed with smiles now had faces that were tripping them up when they left the venue of the @entity23 in 2008			1
now the scene of @entity2 ’s greatest disappointment this century is set to be the place where they complete their summer of supremacy			2
in may , @entity45 won the flagship event on the @entity47 and @entity9 the equivalent in @entity2			1
in june , @entity45 won the @entity49 and @entity50 the first of two big tournament victories in a row on either side of the @entity55			1
then , last month , the @entity9 era began at @entity57 and continued with his stunning success at the @entity59 on sunday			2
the @entity9 era ? rory himself might be keen to play down such talk but not his mentor , @entity62			2
normally one to steer clear of hyperbole , even the great man could n’t help himself			0
‘ @entity9 is so gifted he could win between 15 and 20 majors if that is what he decides he wants to do , ’ he said			1
@entity69 efficiency : @entity45 has won the @entity70 ( left ) and @entity49 ( right ) this year @entity71 : @entity9 has won three tournaments already this year and is looking for a fourth @entity73 highlights no wonder they say all the best things come in threes			1
@entity9 ’s @entity49 success meant he became the first @entity2 golfer in the modern era to win three different majors			1
now he ’s trying to win three events in a row to make it three @entity2 majors in succession			1
it ’s an awesome task , of course , to win three successive tournaments , particularly when two of them are majors			2
@entity91 pulled it off in 2006 and @entity93 in 1971			1
but if anyone in this age can do it , it ’s surely @entity9 , who has got his head down and is a man hell - bent on a mission			2
at a time when his driving , by common consent , is setting new standards , @entity9 finds himself on the longest par - 71 course in major championship history			2
that ’s going to have him licking his chops , is n’t it ? the big thing for @entity9 is whether he can take advantage and hole the birdie putts , like he did at @entity113 and @entity114			0
if he can do that , then he ’s certainly got the mental strength to complete this feat that comes around once in a generation			0
@entity119 : @entity9 clenches his first in celebration after winning the @entity122 last month yet so many @entity2 are at the top of their games right now that the sternest opposition could well come from the men who will be standing by his side at @entity128 next month			1
@entity129 and @entity130 must have almost forgotten what it ’s like not to be on a leaderboard			0
the former played well here in that @entity23 defeat six years ago , winning three points out of four including a singles success against @entity138			0
he ’s also due a dose of fortune after getting the wrong end of the luck of the draw at @entity122			0
@entity130 played poorly at the @entity41 and is not a fan of the course			0
but let ’s hope the man who has just finished runner - up for three events in a row can keep the negative thoughts at bay			0
would anyone seriously begrudge him a major after the tumultuous journey he has been on ; the countless near - misses against the likes of @entity159 , and the despair he felt two years ago at the masters when he said he was n’t good enough to win one ? there ’s more , of course			0
@entity45 had a forgettable july after the highs in may and june but sounded like a man ready to return to his gold standard			1
any other year and @entity169 ’s victory in the @entity170 in june and high finishes at @entity122 and the @entity30 would be worthy of more comment			0
glory ? @entity174 's @entity50 has won twice already this year and will look to add another in @entity16 so close : @entity130 has come within inches of winning several tournaments recently what about two @entity2 who have had quiet summers but who would be fearless if they were in contention ? will this be the week @entity182 or @entity183 join the party ? contrast all this joy with the sense of despondency gripping the @entity42 game			1
@entity91 has somewhat miraculously shown up but to what end ? @entity190 is off somewhere trying to sort his life out and @entity192 is so troubled by a neck injury he had an epidural last week and would n’t be here if he was n’t the defending champion			0
perhaps @entity138 , who signed off from @entity114 with a 62 , can lift the gloom , but it must be @entity198 , the one bright @entity42 spark this summer , who has the best chance			0
his majors record so far this year reads : tied fifth at the masters , and tied second at the @entity49 and @entity122			1
the man with the best chance of disturbing the @entity2 hegemony , however , might well be the man @entity9 has just usurped as world no 1			1
@entity209 @entity208 , like @entity129 , was desperately unfortunate with his @entity49 draw			0
he only finished five shots behind @entity9 at the end , all of which and more could be put down to the markedly harder conditions he played in			0
a marvellous summer then , one in which @entity208 and the leading @entity2 have eclipsed the @entity42 to such an extent they ’ve been locked out of the top five in the world rankings			2
a third successive major , and a notable feat in a summer full of them for @entity2 golf , has never looked more inviting			0
@entity223 : @entity182 is among the @entity2 with a chance of winning the @entity42 @entity47 this week down under : @entity209 @entity208 is the most likely @entity225 to lift the trophy in @entity16 this week			1

@entity2 golfers have never before won three majors in a row
@entity42 @entity47 is at @entity16 , the venue where @entity2 lost the 2008 @entity23
@entity45 won the @entity49 in june and @entity9 the @entity49 in july
@entity45 and @entity9 both also won @entity42 and @entity2 's flagship event this year
@entity50 has also won during the last nine glorious weeks for @entity2
@entity9 is already first @entity2 in modern era to win three different majors
@entity91 and @entity93 won three events , with two majors , in a row
@entity245 is looking to do that at the tender age of 25
