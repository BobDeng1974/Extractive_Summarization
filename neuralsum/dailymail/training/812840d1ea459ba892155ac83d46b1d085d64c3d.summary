obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat - busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gaining weight , a new study has revealed			1
scientists found a specific bacterial family passed down form generation to generation was more common in the guts of lean individuals			1
lab tests showed a strain of that bacteria prevented people gaining weight when it was transplanted in mice			0
genetics influence whether we are fat or thin by shaping which types of microbes thrive in our body , the study found			2
obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat - busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gain weight , a new study has revealed the breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity - related diseases on an individual 's genetic make - up			1
associate professor @entity32 at the @entity33 and genetics of @entity35 said : ' up until now , variation in the abundances of gut microbes has been explained by diet , the environment , lifestyle , and health			1
' this is the first study to firmly establish that certain types of gut microbes are heritable - that their variation across a population is in part due to host genotype variation , not just environmental influences			2
' both genetic variation and the composition of gut microbes have previously been linked to diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity , putting sufferers at greater risk of heart disease , stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels			1
the relationship between genetic variation and the diversity of gut microbes has been difficult to establish			0
past studies of twins failed to reveal an effect of genetic variation on the diversity of gut microbes			0
the @entity35 researchers suspected past studies included too few pairs of twins			1
as a result they sequenced the genes of microbes found in stool samples from 416 pairs of twins			2
they found an abundance of specific types of microbes were more similar in identical twins , who are genetically the same , than in non-identical pairs no more similar than ordinary siblings , other than sharing environmental influences in the womb			1
the findings demonstrated that human genes influence the composition of gut microbes			0
the breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity - related diseases on an individual 's genetic make - up , the team at @entity35 believe			1
file picture the type of bacteria whose abundance was most heavily influenced by human genetics was a recently identified family called christensenellaceae			0
members of the health - promoting bacterial family were more abundant in lean individuals , than those who were obese			1
mice that were then treated with this specific bacteria strain gained less weight than those that were not treated with the microbes			0
the team believe their findings could pave the way for a microbe that prevents obesity in humans			0
prof @entity32 said : ' our results showing that bacterial abundances run in families may be useful for disease risk prediction			2
' the microbiome is also an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation			0
by understanding the nature of our association with these health - associated bacteria , we could eventually exploit them to promote health			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity139 .			0
