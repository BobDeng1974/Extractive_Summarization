@entity0 have had a £ 2million bid rejected for @entity3 left - back @entity2			1
the highly - rated 20 - year - old is out of contract in the summer and has been attracting interest from a number of @entity9 clubs			0
@entity2 has made more than 100 appearances for the @entity12 side and said earlier this month that he was ready to move to a big club			2
@entity2 ( right ) has been linked with a number of @entity9 clubs as well as @entity15 the 20 - year - old believes he is ready to make a move to a bigger club ‘ i do n’t think 20 is too young or too old to move from @entity3			1
i ’m a @entity15 fan and obviously the @entity9 is one of the best leagues in the world , ' @entity2 said			0
‘ that ’s my dream - you want to reach as high a level as you can and if i can get to the @entity9 that would be brilliant			0
@entity24 , who recently appointed former @entity3 manager @entity26 , are also interested in the 20 - year - old full back			1
@entity2 has already made more than 100 appearances for the @entity3 first team meanwhile , the @entity0 have approached @entity30 about making @entity32 's move a permanent one and have been quoted a whopping £ 12m for the right back			1
the @entity35 under 21 international is on a season - long loan at @entity37 and has impressed manager @entity38 with his performances and attitude but a permanent deal will be difficult to seal at that price			0
the 22 - year - old has made 20 appearances already this season as opposed to 22 in the whole of the last campaign with @entity30			0
@entity30 defender @entity32 has been in impressive form since joining the @entity0 on loan @entity32 , pictured with @entity50 , joined @entity0 on a season - long loan deal @entity38 believes two or three extra additions will shape his squad into regular top - six contenders and the purchase of @entity32 would not only be good continuity but prove a good investment for the future			1
however , @entity0 will struggle to meet @entity30 's demands			2
they will reassess their budget in the summer and hope that @entity32 can also push for the move .			0
