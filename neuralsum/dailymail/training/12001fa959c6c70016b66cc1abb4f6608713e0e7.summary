by @entity0 last updated at 9:43 am on 26th december 2011 this hungry toddler wandered off from his parents and ate his way through a three - tiered wedding cake as it was about to be served at a wedding reception			2
@entity8 's parents @entity6 and @entity9 discovered him scoffing down the sponge which was due to be served to around 100 guests as dessert at a working men 's club in @entity14			1
the two - year - old suffers from a rare genetic condition called @entity17 which leaves him with an insatiable appetite because his brain is not able to recognise that he is full			1
stuffing his face with cake : @entity8 eats his way through the three - tier sponge at a wedding reception in july after wandering off from the other guests			1
his rare condition means that he is unable to help himself @entity6 , 45 , and @entity9 , 51 , have to carefully monitor his food intake and have even put locks on the kitchen cupboards as left to his own devices he could potentially eat himself to death			1
mother - of - six @entity6 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , said she was horrified when her son disappeared and she discovered him scoffing the cake			1
' it was a friends ' wedding			2
he was in his walking frame and he went missing , she said			2
' he went walking off somewhere			0
i said to my husband , " where has he gone ? " we went searching and there he was sat stuffing himself with wedding cake			0
' he 'd somehow got himself up on to the seat and then the table where the cake was			0
you ca n't do anything but laugh though because he 's not being naughty			0
' @entity6 found out that @entity8 had @entity17 after he was born eight weeks premature via emergency caesarean			1
horror : @entity6 , 45 , and @entity9 , 51 , were embarrassed to discover that @entity8 was eating the wedding cake			1
however , his mother @entity6 said her little boy can not help himself			1
the couple have learnt sign language as they help him combat his disabilities he also suffers speech and mobility problems and his parents have had to learn sign language to help him communicate			0
@entity6 said : ' we got given a sheet with all the symptoms on it and i started crying but @entity9 was really good and said it does n't matter what he has , he 's our boy and we should be thankful that he 's here			1
that really helped having that support			0
' he 's got a short tongue and a high pallet so we do n't know what we will be able to understand when he starts to speak sentences			0
' @entity8 has just started at nursery and his parents are worried that he will start taking food from the other children without realising that it is wrong			1
@entity6 said : ' as he gets older it will become more difficult to keep him away from food			1
' he already knows where the cupboards with biscuits are so we have to put tags on the handles so he ca n't open them			2
hungry : @entity8 , 2 , eats some raisins			2
he is affected by @entity17 which hits just one in 20,000 people ' i have heard that a lot of @entity96 often take food from others , but again it 's not malicious - they do n't realise it 's wrong			1
' he 's more demanding now because we have to watch him 24/7			0
we have to occupy his mind all the time			0
he always wants more , so i have to steer his mind away from food by distracting him			0
' i have to do physio because he would just sit and do nothing so we have to motivate him to do something so that he builds up his muscles			0
' @entity108 , chief executive of the @entity109 said that sufferers have a lot of difficulties keeping their weight under control			0
' @entity17 is a very cruel syndrome - not only are you driven to eat but you require fewer calories , so in order to maintain a healthy weight you have to be quite strict			1
' the condition comes with other complications			0
often you will have severe learning difficulties			0
some do manage to live with the challenges presented with the constant urge to eat , but it is a day - to - day battle			2
