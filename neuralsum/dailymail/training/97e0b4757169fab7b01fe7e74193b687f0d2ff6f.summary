by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 04:11 est , 11 august 2012 the @entity2 's f - 35 fighter jet programme has been plagued with problems and spiralling costs			1
but this week , the @entity2 was keen to put the aircraft 's troubles to one side to launch its first weapons test - using an inert bomb with no target			1
the test marks something of a step forward in the programme , which may yet be axed to reduce the $ 1.4trillion @entity16 deficit			1
current @entity2 plans call for buying some 2,443 f - 35s for the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 through to the mid- 2030s at a cost projected to top $ 396billion ( £ 254billion )			1
in february last year the @entity2 said the price of each fighter jet could rise to a staggering $ 304.15million ( £ 194.8million )			1
wednesday 's test checked the jet could actually release a bomb from its carriage systems and path away from the aircraft but did not check for targeting			1
' the targeting aspect will come further down the road , ' said @entity44 , spokesman for the f - 35 integrated test facility at @entity46 , @entity47			1
he declined to say when however			0
the event , which was captured on film , is one of thousands being tested this year and starts the ' validation ' of the ability to drop precision weapons on the ground and in the air , the command added			2
dogged by problems : in february last year the @entity2 said the price of each fighter jet could rise to $ 304.15million ( £ 194.8million ) the @entity60 is the short take - off and vertical landing ( @entity63 ) variant of the @entity65 aircraft			1
it has just two - thirds of the @entity69 's fuel capacity in order to make room for its vertical flight design			0
unlike other f - 35 designs , the b aircraft has no landing hook			0
instead , it sends jet thrust straight downwards during vertical take - offs and landings			2
captain @entity81 , director of test for the naval versions , said in the statement : ' while this weapons separation test is just one event in a series of hundreds of flights and thousands of test points that we are executing this year , it does represent a significant entry into a new phase of testing for the f - 35 programme			2
' the @entity2 this year postponed production of 179 f - 35s until after 2017 , stretching out development and testing to curb costly retrofits			2
but the latest restructuring , the third such major revamp , has added 33 months and an extra $ 7.9 billion to the development plan			0
last year the commandant of the @entity20 general @entity104 defended the programme and said there was ' no plan b ' if the plans were axed			2
he said at the time : ' to do the things that our nation requires of this @entity20 , we need this airplane			0
so i do n't speculate : " will it make it through probation ? " i 'm absolutely confident it will			0
' hundreds of additional f - 35s are expected to be purchased by @entity16 friends and allies , including eight co-development partners - @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and the @entity130			0
the @entity65 , also called the @entity65 , is designed to replace a range of fighter , strike and ground - attack aircraft , including the @entity135 , the world 's most widely used fighter jet			0
now watch the @entity65 in action			0

current @entity2 plans for jet programme projected to top $ 396billion
@entity2 dropped 1,000lb inert bomb over @entity34
trial was carried out to see if jet could drop bomb from carriage but did not test for targeting
