by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:06 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:53 est , 18 december 2013 when you ’re holding a christening , there are plenty of things to remember – but surely an important one is ensuring the star of the day is buckled up on the way to church			1
however , lord @entity12 ’s four - month - old daughter @entity11 was carried on the lap of her mother @entity14 instead of in a car seat , an offence that can carry a £ 500 fine			1
lord @entity12 ’s father prince @entity18 was also spotted driving to the christening with his wife @entity20 and their daughter @entity21 in the back seat – neither of whom were wearing seatbelts			1
risk : lord @entity12 's four - month - old daughter @entity11 was carried on the lap of her mother @entity14 instead of in a car seat embarrassingly , prince @entity18 is patron of the @entity30 and last week handed out prizes for his acclaimed international road safety awards scheme at the @entity33 in @entity34			1
the royals were spotted on the way to the christening at the @entity38 at @entity39 of @entity40 , who is 42nd in line to the throne			1
@entity44 – who gave birth at the @entity47 @entity46 in @entity48 on august 15 – is based in @entity49 as she pursues her acting career			2
another royal baby in 2013 : lord and @entity14 with their daughter , @entity11 , in the @entity55 at @entity39 following her private christening the 33 - year - old most recently appeared in last year ’s @entity56 , a mini-series by @entity59 creator @entity58			1
last night @entity60 , president of the @entity61 , said : ‘ you could be kind by suggesting as this couple live in @entity49 they may have come to @entity65 and not been able to find a child seat for their car			0
that has happened to me when i have hired a car abroad and it is a frightening experience			0
new regulations governing the use of child car seat came into force in september 2006 it was announced then that the standard fixed penalty for not using a child restraint is £ 30 but if the case goes to court the maximum fine is £ 500			0
seat belts must be worn by adult passengers who are classed as 14 and over			0
the law states that children must be seated in a child or booster seat to protect them adequately from road accidents , up until they are 12 years old or 135cm tall			0
it has been revealed , however , that over a quarter ( 26 per cent ) of parents do not know this law , and 26 per cent have used a seat that does not fit properly			0
almost half ( 47 per cent ) have foregone the use of a seat when in a vehicle other than their own , such as a taxi or friend ’s car , and 27 per cent have used a seat that would not be recommended by safety experts , such as a second hand model			0
one in 20 parents admitted they have never used a child or booster seat			0
‘ however , the laws are clear and are in the @entity108 - and the @entity61 view is that a child in a car is far safer being held in a proper car seat or child restraint			2
‘ that goes for all members of the public and irrespective of whether you are royalty			0
’ @entity12 ’s wife @entity14 - who gave birth to her daughter at the @entity47 @entity46 in @entity48 on august 15 - bases herself in the @entity49 to pursue her acting career			1
car child seats and seat belts must also be used in @entity49 by law - but the ages of when children must be restrained does vary in different states			2
in the @entity65 the maximum fine which can be imposed by a court for not wearing a seat belt or similar restraint in a car is £ 500			2
the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) charity has a website relating to the use of child care seats which states : ‘ failure to wear a seat belt or failure to ensure that a child passenger uses an appropriate child restraint or wears a seat belt according to the legal requirements described above , could affect any claims against your motor insurance cover			0
‘ you could also face civil proceedings for damages , if you failed to safely carry someone else ’s child			0
but of course the most serious penalty of all could be that you or a passenger loses their life ! ’ others seen not wearing belts at the christening included @entity14 ’s mother - in - law princess @entity18 and her daughter @entity21			1
car safety charity @entity163 has recently warned parents that 700 children under eight years old are killed or seriously injured in road accidents each year , but that the use of a child or booster seat can greatly reduce the risk of a fatality			0
support : @entity14 said her husband lord @entity12 was ' very brave ' during the labour as she ' just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head ' @entity178 , deputy chief executive of @entity163 , said earlier this year : ‘ it ’s vital that parents , carers and of course the wider driving public understand how best to protect children on roads , and its worrying to find common misunderstanding about child car seats			1
we recommend parents always use a correctly - fitted suitable child or booster seat until a child is 150cm tall			2
’ on monday @entity194 wore the same @entity196 lace christening gown as @entity197 of @entity198 who was christened at the same venue in october			2
on that occasion the young @entity201 was seen in his car seat both arriving and leaving @entity39 - and he was famously carried by @entity204 in a car seat when he left hospital shortly after being born			1
many hospitals have a policy which will not allow them to discharge a new - born baby unless parents can show they have a car seat installed in their vehicle			2
proud grandfather : prince @entity18 arrived with his wife and daughter @entity214 , pictured			1
embarrassingly the @entity216 is patron of the @entity30 the @entity217 refused to comment on the matter			1
the awards are said to ‘ recognise achievements and innovations which will improve road safety			0
’ according to his awards website ‘ all road users are asked to identify those whose initiatives make our roads safer and nominate them for an award			0
’ embarrassingly for the prince the last awards ceremony and @entity232 was held less than a fortnight ago			1
