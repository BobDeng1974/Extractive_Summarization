a vulnerable elderly man who died in the midst of a care home scandal can not be named on the orders of public officials , the @entity0 can reveal			1
the 85 - year - old died less than 48 hours after being evacuated from a home that was suddenly closed after an inspection found filthy conditions , untrained staff and old people confined to a narrow area of the building			1
but his death and all details about it have been kept secret by the @entity16 , the local council , the register office which keeps death records , and the coroner who is supposed to investigate questionable deaths			2
evacuation : the man who died , whose details are being kept secret , was among those removed from @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , during the night critics have questioned how it is possible for an individual supposedly under the care of the state to die in secret with the public prevented from knowing his name , let alone the circumstances in which he died			1
the incident has provoked anger among @entity40 , watchdogs for the elderly , and civil liberties groups			0
one mp said : ‘ if he was killed by the state you would expect the people involved to try to cover it up			1
’ the concern over the death of the 85 - year - old , comes at a time of deepening alarm over the use of secrecy in the court system , and the spread of secrecy over deaths in particular			1
in the @entity28 care home incident , both the coroner ’s office – which said there was nothing suspicious about the death – and the register office responsible for recording it cited the @entity68 as a reason they could not identify the dead man			1
the @entity68 does not extend to cover information about the deceased			1
the home was shut following an inspection by the @entity77 ; it ordered it be immediately closed after discovering an ‘ overpowering ’ smell of urine and that staff had not undergone safety checks , and because of a broken lift , some of the 25 residents were confined to the top floor of the building the incident came after the sudden closure of the @entity26 nursing home in @entity27 , @entity28 , following an inspection by the @entity77			1
the regulator gave the home , which was run by @entity93 and his wife @entity94 , a clean bill of health in january			2
however , earlier this month it ordered immediate closure of the home after discovering an ‘ overpowering ’ smell of urine and that staff had not undergone safety checks			1
because of a broken lift , some of the 25 residents were confined to the top floor of the building			0
the residents were moved out of the home after dark , with the assistance of social workers , in a chaotic operation in which some were left in their pyjamas on one of the coldest nights of the year			1
families were notified only hours before			0
the 85 - year - old was moved to @entity114 nursing home nearby			1
the only public record of what happened to him next has been released by @entity119 , which said an ambulance and a response car were sent to the @entity114 home just after 5.30am on december 11			2
this was less than two days after the evacuation of @entity26			1
@entity126 director @entity125 spoke briefly to say that a man moved from @entity26 had died			1
scandal : the home was run by @entity93 and his wife @entity94 , pictured above all other aspects of the death remain secret and none of the authorities involved have been willing even to identify the individual			1
the @entity136 and @entity137 , one of whose hospitals accepted the 85 - year - old , said they would not name him			1
@entity143 , whose social workers supervised the @entity26 evacuation , and which funds the coroners ’ office and supervises the register office , declined to identify the man who died while in its care			1
@entity154 register office , responsible for recording the death , also declined to identify him			2
an official said : ‘ due to data protection we need to fulfil certain criteria in order to locate your record			0
the criteria would be a date of death , a name and a place of death			2
’ the @entity169 , which is in charge of registration procedures , backed up the refusal to identify him			0
chief responsibility for establishing that there are no suspicious circumstances to the death lies with @entity28 coroner @entity178			1
mr @entity178 has decided no inquest into the death is required and that the public do not have a right to know the name of the man who died			1
an official said during inquiries by the @entity0 that the @entity68 was ‘ part ’ of the reason			1
mr @entity178 ’ office said yesterday : ‘ we would n’t give you the name			0
if an inquest has happened we would , but as it ’s not an inquest we wo n’t			0
it ’s for the family ’s privacy			0
we do n’t give out names			0
it ’s as simple as that			0
’ the secret death of a vulnerable elderly man following severe state intrusion into his life provoked widespread concern			1
the residents were moved out of the home after dark , with the assistance of social workers , in a chaotic operation in which some were left in their pyjamas on one of the coldest nights of the year @entity215 mp @entity214 said : ‘ if you do not release the name of the individual nobody can know if it was a natural death or not			1
if he was killed by the state you would expect the people involved to try to cover it up			2
’ dr @entity224 , the government ’s older workers ’ champion , said : ‘ we must not keep sweeping these things under the carpet			0
’ she called for an investigation into the death by the @entity77			2
the civil liberties campaign group @entity231 said : ‘ when a vulnerable person dies in care , there is a legitimate public interest in knowing what happened			2
in whose interest is it to keep such things a secret ? ’ the @entity28 case comes against a background of concern over the suspicious death of 13 - month - old @entity245 in @entity246 two years ago			1
despite a long - running police investigation , an inquest in october revealed no more than the girl ’s name , and a high court judge has ruled that details of her death must continue to be kept secret after a request from social workers			2
the @entity257 said yesterday that it was up to local @entity16 agencies to choose whether they wanted to name patients			0
the @entity261 and @entity262 declined to comment			0
under attack , a right to know enshrined for 800 years the public interest in proper investigation of deaths has been established for more than eight centuries			0
under this principle , no deaths can be recorded without the public knowing how they happened and being reassured that there was no criminal activity or neglect			0
but our right to this information seems to be under attack			2
in recent years , even the names of people who have been the subject of supposedly open inquests have been kept secret			0
a death is reported to the coroner when a doctor suspects it may have occurred in suspicious circumstances , was sudden or unexplained , or was due to neglect			2
other reasons include an accident or a suicide			0
rule 11 of the @entity294 ( inquest ) rules 2013 states that inquests must be held in public unless there are national security concerns – a category that @entity303 ministers had wanted to widen			0
in 2012 , the government drew back from plans to allow more inquests to be held in secret because of @entity215 opposition			0
coroners are supposed to abide by the principle of open justice , which means they should make public the steps they have taken to assess a particular case			0
but earlier this year , @entity318 coroner @entity317 refused to reveal the name of a man into whose death he conducted an inquest			1
the man , whose death was found to be related to drink and drugs , was identified only as @entity325 mr @entity317 said : ‘ he has a highly unusual surname and it is my decision not to make public the surname of the individual			2
’ he added that he did not want any children to be put at risk			0
another death that has remained shrouded in secrecy is that of a 13 - month - old girl , @entity245 , in @entity246 in december 2012			1
her inquest – which was meant to examine the circumstances of her death – revealed nothing to the public about what happened			0
a police inquiry is continuing			0
if a coroner closes a case after deciding an inquest is not needed , the law is less clear on whether the details should be public – but in theory the open justice principle still stands .			0

@entity26 nursing home in @entity27 was closed earlier this month
