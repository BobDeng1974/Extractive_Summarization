@entity2 's first @entity1 game of the season against @entity4 rivals @entity5 could set fans back as much as £ 77 for an adult ticket , causing uproar among @entity2 fans			1
saturday 's opener at @entity11 , kicking off at 3pm , has been classed as a @entity13 fixture , with the cheapest ticket for members £ 50 and non-members £ 55			1
in stark contrast , @entity17 , who finished just three points below the @entity2 in their first season back in the @entity1 , are charging a flat price of £ 16 around the ground for their first home fixture against @entity26 's new club @entity25 on sunday august 24			1
supporters believe the increase in the multi-billion pound tv deals , including the @entity1 media deal worth £ 5.5billion , should allow for a decrease in ticket prices			0
@entity49 , chief executive of the @entity41 , said : ' nine out of 10 fans think football 's simply too expensive			0
' there 's always the odd deal that clubs can quote to play it down , but the truth is supporters tell us they think tickets cost too much			0
' table : prices for first two weeks of fixtures ( red indicates highest and lowest price ) bang for buck : @entity2 are the most expensive for home and away fans , while @entity17 represent the cheapest paying for what ? many feel @entity2 's style of play does not warrant such prices , despite being a @entity4 club @entity2 are charging juniors £ 41 in @entity76 areas of the ground , while @entity17 fans under 15 can go for as little as £ 5 for the @entity80 fixture			1
the most expensive ticket for the @entity5 game is £ 75 , with a £ 2 booking fee for all purchases			1
despite the expected difference in @entity13 and @entity80 prices , @entity2 fans are already disgruntled at having to watch what some of the faithful regard as poor football			2
@entity2 won just seven of their 19 games at home last season in the top flight , scoring 25 goals			0
but the club do offer incentives for fans throughout the term , particularly for juniors			0
six ' kids for a @entity103 ' fixtures are named in a season , as well as earmarking one game where under 16s can attend for free			2
however , the prices have caused anger on social media , with football fans wondering how a side that struggled in the @entity1 last season can charge supporters so much			0
@entity114 ( @ adieleahy ) , who voiced his concerns to @entity2 co-chairman @entity116 on @entity117 , said : ' @ davidgold if you really are serious about making football affordable how come you keep raising the prices ? more & more fans priced out ! ' @entity123 ( @ @entity124 ) added : ' how can west ham charge £ 70 to the game against spurs ? would n't mind but we do n't even play football ! @entity130 ! ! @ davidgold			1
' @entity131 ( @ { griffina71 ) said : ' i took my son to watch @entity134 last year return flight and ticket cost £ 6 less ! ! ! ! ' not content : @entity2 endured a tough season last term , with @entity140 under pressure from fans affordable : in contrast , @entity17 are offering adult tickets for £ 16 for all @entity80 games at the @entity147 venue : the @entity147 saw @entity1 football return last season , with @entity17 finishing 16th with it costing £ 35 to become a member at @entity11 , the ticket prices for non-members could discourage new fans from deciding to attend @entity2 games at short notice			1
@entity5 is a @entity13 fixture , alongside the visits of @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			2
eleven other @entity1 clubs are listed as @entity168 fixtures , costing as much as £ 55 for members and £ 60 for non-members , while the @entity172 match at @entity11 is graded as @entity80 , priced £ 20 to £ 30			1
fans across the @entity1 have a right to feel disgruntled about ticket prices for the highest category games			0
hull themselves charge adults £ 50 , seniors and young adults £ 30 , and juniors £ 20 for @entity13 games at the @entity147 , while @entity2 are not the only club charging a premium , particularly in the capital			1
on show : @entity17 fans will be hoping for a good start at the @entity189 against @entity25 , who will have @entity26 starring value for money : @entity17 won the same amount of games at home as @entity2 last term ( seven ) , and reached the @entity197 final , meaning they are now in this season 's @entity198 to come : @entity2 will hope to offer more affordable prices when they move to the @entity201 in 2016 at newly - promoted @entity205 , ' @entity203 ' seats for their category a fixtures - against @entity160 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity161 , @entity5 , @entity163 and @entity2 - will set non-members back £ 70			1
across the capital at @entity160 , the most expensive category a ticket for non-members is £ 97 , while seeing the big clashes at @entity208 will set you back £ 81 , including their home match against @entity2			2
a ticket see @entity216 's @entity161 at @entity217 against top opposition costs £ 82			0
in their penultimate campaign at @entity11 before moving to the @entity201 , @entity2 announced in april they would be freezing prices on season tickets for this term			0
the most expensive adult season ticket is £ 910 for new applicants , while renewals saved £ 20			2
but the cheapest , at £ 620 , is still more expensive than @entity4 rivals @entity161 's least expensive option for this season , as well as the cheapest ticket at @entity165			0
football for all : @entity17 fans can enjoy affordable prices for the lesser @entity1 games all year round			0
