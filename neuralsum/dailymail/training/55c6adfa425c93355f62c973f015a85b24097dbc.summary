a lesbian couple is taking an @entity2 town to court claiming they have faced ten years of harassment , including anonymous bullying , unjust fines and dead animals being dumped on their lawn			1
the couple , @entity11 and @entity12 , from @entity13 , are suing for what they allege is more than a decade of discrimination			1
their lawyer , @entity17 , says the town has tried to push couple out since they moved there in 2004			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , who are suing the @entity2 town of @entity13 after what they claim is decades of discrimination @entity17 said : ' it 's entirely based on their sexual orientation			1
' @entity30 insulted them , made obscene gestures to them			0
' there were dead animals left on their property			1
' the couple are seeking both peace , and damages for their suffering , and they do n't want to have to move to get it			2
according to @entity45 , among some of the alleged grievances is the incidence of the women â€™s property , which is next to @entity49 , being the topic of discussion at two zoning meetings , with their lawyer claiming they were never informed			0
the complaint also said the couple filed numerous issues with the town regarding neighbors and zoning regulation , but that the town purposely refused to respond			2
graffiti in the town that the couple claim was discriminatory and directed at them , for which they are suing for damages after the women , who have been partners for 21 years , had been receiving regular threats , they put up a fence in 2008 , which their lawyer claimed fit in with the town 's requirements , but two meetings were held about the fence without @entity78 or @entity79 's knowing			1
another issue occurred when the town refused to allow a handicap ramp to be set up at the home for @entity12 's mother , with clerks saying she had to accept the town 's judgement or face a $ 100 fine			1
mr @entity17 also said that his clients had been intimidated by anonymous bullying , after a letter circulated through the town in 2011 saying that they were con artists			2
the letter was titled ' the truth about @entity95 ' and read : ' it has been over 6 years that the subject two women have been passing themselves off as involved citizens and very concerns about the town direction and in particular with @entity101 , the school and the environment			2
' beware : this is a totally phony perception that they have fabricated is a front to cover their devious and vicious behavior			0
' a year later , a @entity110 lawyer received a letter purportedly from @entity78 and @entity12 claiming the couple would not pay him for his services.the letter read : ' we just thought we would give you a heads up as to our past games with previous attorneys in the state of @entity2 and also lawyers in @entity110			1
' we love to play head games with them and give them a run for their money			0
the case filed against senior members of the town , who the couple have named and shamed as people involved in a pattern of discrimination due to their sexuality @entity78 and @entity12 have denied that they ever sent the letter			1
after that , a homophobic slur was spray - painted outside of the town offices , and @entity78 and @entity12 believe it was directed towards them			1
the lawsuit was filed by @entity78 and @entity12 last week , naming the head of their local zoning committee and baptist minister , @entity145 , as a co-defendant in the case			2
the lawsuit also includes two neighbours as co-defendants , and outlines six grievances , including defamation and discrimination based on sexual orientation			0
gay marriage is currently legal in @entity2 , which has meant that the claims have come as a shock to many onlookers , as it is seen as a progressive state			0
the statute took effect in 2009 , allowing same - sex couples to wed in the northeastern state , which was also the first to allow civil unions in the @entity165 back in 2000			0
@entity17 said : ' their hope is this lawsuit will change things			0
' civil rights laws are very favorable in recognizing in that there should n't be discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation and they never expected they would be moving into this hotbed of hatred			0
