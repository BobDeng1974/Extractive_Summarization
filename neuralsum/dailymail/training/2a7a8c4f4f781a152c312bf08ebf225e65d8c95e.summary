there ’s a new buzz to beauty gadgets in 2015			1
this year , the key to glowing skin , shiny teeth and silky smooth legs lies with the latest vibrating technology			1
vibrating gadgets can be used to remove hair more easily , increase blood flow to ease aches and pains and can even reduce the look of wrinkles			1
@entity15 tried out a selection and asked cosmetic expert dr @entity17 at @entity18 to give her opinion			1
polishing teeth @entity22 dental polisher , £ 9.99 , @entity22 ( from january 11 ) the vibe : a home dental hygiene product for cleaning teeth , eliminating plaque and removing stains in seconds			1
the test : although i loathe going to the dentist , i love the fresh feeling in your mouth as you leave with squeaky - clean teeth			1
the device looks like a small drill but with a little silicone cup at the end which i fill with my normal toothpaste			2
the vibration is surprisingly forceful and i struggle to hold the polisher against my teeth			1
an unattractive line of dribble trickles down my chin as i run it along my front top teeth for about a minute as instructed and then inspect them in the mirror			1
they feel very clean and look shiny			2
the expert : the vibrations agitate bits of calcium deposit , not plaque , which form on the teeth , so they come off and teeth are polished smooth			1
there have been studies done into the use of such machines in dogs with problem teeth and results have been excellent			1
9/10 deep skin - cleansing @entity67 , £ 99 , lookfantastic.com the vibe : the first t - sonic facial - cleansing brush , for a deep and gentle clean in just one minute			1
the test : this device uses something called t - sonic technology that generates up to 8,000 pulsations per minute			1
the @entity67 is about the size of a jam jar lid and the thickness of a large roll of @entity79			2
i clean my face then wet the @entity82 , running it over my dry cheeks , forehead and nose			2
the rapid vibration is gloriously soothing			2
but beyond looking slightly flushed , i still do n’t get the vibrating cleanser thing — i can achieve the same effect with an exfoliator			1
the expert : really , it ’s facial cleansing for lazy people			2
if you must invest in one of these cleansers , this might be a good choice as it ’s easy to clean			2
7/10 massaging feet @entity100 , £ 9.99 , jmldirect.com the vibe : press down to activate the soothing vibrations while six massaging rollers knead aches and pains away			2
the test : after a morning of cleaning the house , i had aching feet and unpacked this surprisingly elegant - looking item with enthusiasm			2
i placed my feet one at a time on the rollers and pressed down gently			2
the entire machine vibrates , but you have to create your own deep tissue massage sensation by running your foot up and down the rollers			2
i ’m a fan of hugely painful reflexology where the feet literally crackle , so i would have enjoyed more pressure			2
i would n’t say my feet felt completely refreshed , but they were certainly much better			2
the expert : this is great			2
blood circulation will be increased to the feet , and therefore more oxygen and nutrients brought to the area , and if you ’ve been on your feet all day , massaging the muscles and tendons on the sole of the foot will alleviate tension and tightness			1
6/10 exfoliation @entity136 wet and dry face and body brush from @entity139 , £ 39.99 , lookfantastic.com the vibe : all - over deep - cleansing and exfoliation			0
the test : this comes with four detachable heads for the separate functions : a dry brush for exfoliating the body , a pumice stone to remove dry skin on the feet , a loofah for gentle exfoliation in the shower and a facial cleansing brush			1
it ’s winter and my feet are as dry as withered husks			0
the rotating pumice stone sloughs off the dead skin rapidly and painlessly , which is highly satisfying			1
i take the loofah into the shower and administer a top to toe rubdown , after which my skin feels softer			1
my favourite attachment is the dry brush , which is slightly abrasive on my dry thighs , but leaves them tingling and looking smoother			0
the facial cleansing brush is also invigorating			0
the expert : we know that such beauty tricks as dry brushing for circulation and skin tone , and pumice to exfoliate dry skin are effective			1
here , it ’s taking the effort away by rotating and vibrating against the skin			1
7/10 applying foundation @entity185 auto make - up multi-functional auto - puff , £ 29.99 , skinpep.co.uk the vibe : the vibrating anti-bacterial puff provides smooth application with no lumps			1
expertly blends liquid or powder foundation for professional results			0
the test : this sounded like a ridiculous gimmick			0
i never have ‘ lumps ’ in my foundation			0
but then i have a think and realise that i do n’t blend make - up very well around the edges of my face			0
further reflection ( and a quick chat with my husband ) leads to the conclusion that i often look ‘ blotchy ’			0
i dab a little foundation onto the pad provided and turn the gadget on			0
i move it over my nose , across my forehead and then ( as though i ’m a painting by numbers colouring book ) fill in the rest of my face			0
the gentle vibration feels soft			0
incredibly , and i mean this , because i was quite prepared to be very rude — the finished look is dewy and even			0
the expert : if you look at skin microscopically , the surface is irregular , with lots of dead skin cells , and the incredibly fast vibrations of this gadget — 1,000 - a - minute — will push foundation down and create a smooth surface			1
9/10 quick fix facial anti-ageing @entity233 lift away the years ( includes serum ) , £ 59.99 , crystalclear.co.uk the vibe : the combination of gentle vibrations coupled with intensely effective serum produces outstanding anti-ageing results after just two minutes			0
the test : the serum is fresh and lemon - scented			0
the gadget looks like a felt pen			0
at the top is a little roller ball , which i unscrew and tip a little serum inside the lid			0
as you press the on button , this top bit starts to vibrate gently and i run the smooth , cold roller ball around my face			0
there is a technique to the lifting : first i work from the base of the neck towards my jawline in small circular movements			0
next , i go from jawline to nose , then from cheeks towards ears and finally the forehead			0
my skin looks plumped up and fresh for a few hours and i ’m sure daily use would produce more benefits			1
the expert : this is quite expensive			0
the oscillating head will improve blood flow to the skin , which brings vital nutrients and oxygen as well as removing toxins from the area , but i ’m not sure it will make anyone look younger			1
7/10 hair removal @entity282 , £ 6.99 , @entity283 the vibe : the blades glide effortlessly through hair with less pull and tug			1
the test : i ask my husband to try this new electric razor , which looks like any standard razor but has a slightly bulkier handle because of the button at the front which causes the blade to vibrate			0
mr @entity298 has used the same razor since i have met him and is averse to change , but emerges from the shower reluctantly impressed the vibrations apparently create a good , close shave			0
i give it a go and the vibrating blade runs smoothly over my legs , whizzing off the stubble of hair which has accumulated in the week since i last shaved			1
the results are quite incredible and my legs and armpits are as smooth as a grape			0
it takes the same time as usual and is totally painless			0
the expert : vibration supposedly makes hair stand up on end so that you can get a closer shave — which makes a great deal of sense			1
8/10 full body massage @entity323 , £ 112 , @entity324 the vibe : infrared heat helps to loosen tense muscles while the vibrating , two - level seat helps to relax tired legs			1
the test : this is like a giant child ’s car seat , which can be attached to an ordinary chair with strong @entity337 strips			0
when turned on the seat vibrates , nodules roll up and down the spine and red light warms your back			0
close your eyes and you could almost be in a tropical location , being pummelled by an expert			0
the pressure of the massage is firm , and feels like strong fingers , the heat from the infrared is deliciously warm on sore muscles , and the vibration of the seat invigorating			0
probably not for all ages , but various members of my family ( aged four to 91 ) tried it out and had to be forced off			0
the expert : here , the heat will be improving blood flow to the muscles and therefore alleviating tension and pain			1
combined with the deep massage and vibrating seat you are getting a triple whammy of relief			1

the key to the best skin and teeth this year is vibrating technology
it can be used to remove hair painlessly by increasing blood flow
