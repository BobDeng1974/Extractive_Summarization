by @entity0 published : 00:47 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 00:50 est , 11 june 2013 an aircraft preservation group has denied a millionaire 's claim that it found pioneering aviator @entity5 's missing plane in 2010 but sat on the news so it could solicit him to pay for a later search			1
mystery has surrounded @entity5 's fate since her plane disappeared in 1937 in the @entity12			1
@entity5 was the first woman to fly across the @entity13 in 1932 but many experts believe she crashed into the @entity12 a few years later while trying to establish a record as the first woman to fly around the world			1
@entity18 , son of the late philanthropist @entity19 , filed a federal lawsuit in @entity21 last week against @entity22 ( @entity22 ) and @entity23 , the group 's executive director			1
enduring riddle : @entity31 aviator @entity5 , posing by her plane in @entity28 , @entity29 , in 1930 , disappeared while flying over the @entity12 in 1937 fate : the @entity33 taking off from @entity34 at @entity35 , @entity29 , on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight @entity19 , who lives in @entity40 , @entity21 , claims the @entity42 group solicited $ 1 million from him last year without telling him it had found @entity5 's plane in its underwater search two years earlier			1
@entity19 's lawsuit says the 2010 search in the waters around the @entity49 atoll of @entity50 , about 1,800 miles south of @entity51 , captured underwater images of the ' wreckage of the @entity33 flown by @entity5 when she disappeared in 1937 '			1
the suit claims the aircraft recovery group intentionally misrepresented the status of its exploration to @entity58 last year , telling him a discovery of @entity5 's plane was yet possible if he supported the search			1
the lawsuit states @entity19 contributed stock worth more than $ 1 million to the 2012 search and accuses the organization of engaging in a pattern of racketeering to defraud him			2
@entity69 ? a grainy sonar image released last month by @entity22 off the @entity12 island of @entity49 could show the remains of @entity5 's doomed plane @entity74 , a @entity75 lawyer representing @entity19 , said on monday that he has viewed the images from the 2010 search that the lawsuit maintains show the wreckage of @entity5 's plane			1
' as a layman , it is hard to see , unless you know what you 're looking at it , ' @entity74 said of the footage , which he said he could n't share			0
' much of it relates to the landing gear and parts that are unique to the landing gear			0
' @entity74 said @entity19 engaged experts to examine the underwater images against parts they knew were unique to the @entity5 aircraft			1
he said they reached a ' definitive conclusion that that is in fact the wreckage , and it had been discovered two years before our client paid for another expedition '			2
@entity74 acknowledged that the aircraft preservation group might have had more to gain by publicizing a true discovery of the @entity5 wreckage			1
but he noted : ' for whatever reason they did n't do that in this case , and they continue to solicit funds under the pretense that they have not found it			0
' rare : the only known picture of @entity5 's @entity33 taking off from @entity115 , @entity116 for the 2,550 - mile flight to @entity118 missing : @entity5 and @entity119 , left , before they set off on their doomed flight			1
right : earhart as a young pilot @entity124 , a lawyer in @entity125 , @entity126 , represents the group , known as @entity22 , and was a team member on the 2010 @entity5 search mission			1
he said on monday the organization strongly denies @entity19 's claim that it found the plane			2
he said it is raising funds for another search that could occur as soon as the end of next year			0
' @entity22 does not possess any definitive evidence as to the whereabouts of @entity5 's @entity33 , and did not conclusively make any discoveries in 2010 which it 's withheld , ' @entity124 said			1
' all of its information and its research is compiled and available for public viewing on its website			0
' @entity124 said he respects @entity19 's opinion but is n't aware of any videographic or forensic expert who has validated his conclusions			2
' i have looked at some of the underwater imagery that he 's referring to			0
i was , in fact , present during the 2010 expedition when that imagery was taken , ' he said			0
' and i can just tell you that i do n't see any of the things that @entity74 sees in those images			0
' @entity124 said he 's been a member of the group for 17 years and sits on its board of directors			2
he said he 's been involved in the @entity5 search for at least that long			1
' i would tell you that there is no financial gain for us in hiding the discovery of the most famous missing aviator in the history of aviation , ' @entity124 said			2
' just the opposite ; we would want to publicize the finding to ensure that we can protect it adequately			0
' intrigue : in her day , @entity5 was extremely popular , but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive 75 years later the most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea			1
there have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery , but none have been proven			0
another popular theory is that they landed on the island of @entity50 in the @entity187 , 350 miles southeast of @entity118 and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease			0
improvised tools and bits of plexiglas that are consistent with that of an @entity33 window were found on the island			0
a few theorists reckon that she @entity5 was spying on @entity200 and had been captured and executed			2
this theory has been discounted by the @entity31 authorities and press			0
a rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on @entity207 , an @entity209 - language @entity200 propaganda station designed to attack the @entity211 ' morale			0
an @entity213 aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed @entity5 and @entity215 may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip			2
the most wacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity			0
a woman from @entity220 successfully sued for $ 1.5million in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory .			0

famous aviator disappeared as she attempted an around the world flight in 1937
@entity18 filed a lawsuit last week against @entity22
