@entity0 , the @entity1 and @entity2 relied on the incredible ' @entity3 ' to launch their planes from the air in the 2012 @entity7 film			1
and now , the @entity9 military is taking a leaf out of @entity12 's comic after it invited people to submit ideas for future ' aircraft carriers in the sky			1
' the hope is that these flying fortresses will someday carry , launch and recover multiple swarms of drones anywhere in the world			2
' the hopes is that these flying fortresses will someday carry , launch and recover multiple swarms of potentially deadly drones anywhere in the world			2
artist 's impression pictured according to @entity24 - the @entity37 's advanced military technology research agency - military air operations typically rely on large , manned , robust aircraft			1
but such missions put these expensive aircraft , and their pilots , at risk			2
and while small unmanned aircraft systems ( @entity45 ) can reduce or eliminate such risks , they lack the speed , range and endurance of larger aircraft			1
@entity24 believes the solution is to create a flying @entity7 - style platform that can rapidly carry these drones wherever needed			1
the concept resembles @entity3 ( pictured ) used in the 2012 film @entity7			1
@entity0 , the @entity1 and @entity2 relied on this craft to launch their planes from the air ' we want to find ways to make smaller aircraft more effective , and one promising idea is enabling existing large aircraft , with minimal modification , to become ' aircraft carriers in the sky ' , ' said @entity68 , @entity24 project manager			1
drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in ‘ swarms ’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years , according to a recent roadmap			2
unmanned aircraft carrying stronger chemical weapons could also be on the horizon , the @entity9 @entity75 ( @entity37 ) revealed in its @entity79			0
while the document sets out plans for unmanned maritime , land and air vehicles , there is a lot of focus on the future capability of controversial drones , which , if the plans come to fruition , could deviate from mission commands set by humans if they spot a better target			0
the @entity37 's roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘ swarms ’ of drone - bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘ mothership ’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into , guided by the bots ’ on - board cameras			0
' we envision innovative launch and recovery concepts for new @entity45 designs that would couple with recent advances in small payload design and collaborative technologies			0
' the new project , called @entity113 , is likely to use a plane similar to the @entity116 bomber , @entity118 bomber or @entity120 cargo plane , according to a report by the @entity122			1
@entity24 is also involved in another initiative , dubbed the @entity124 , which is aiming to develop a network of undersea ' motherships ' , capable of deploying both underwater and aerial drones			2
meanwhile , the @entity129 is developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms , hover like bees , crawl like spiders and even sneak up on unsuspecting			0
the @entity135 , a research arm of the @entity129 , last year released a computer - animated video outlining the future capabilities of @entity139 ( @entity140 )			0
' @entity140 will become a vital element in the ever - changing war - fighting environment and will help ensure success on the battlefield of the future , ' the video explained			0
' @entity148 , pervasive , lethal - @entity139 , enhancing the capabilities of the future war fighter			0
' @entity129 officials have already produced tiny remote - control prototypes - but they consume so much power that can only operate for a few minutes			0
researchers estimate that it will take several years of advances in battery technology to make the designs feasible			0
this new project , called @entity113 , is likely to use a plane similar to the @entity116 bomber , @entity118 bomber ( pictured ) or @entity120 cargo plane @entity24 , the @entity37 's @entity164 - based military research agency , claims these flying fortresses will overcome the limits of speed , range and endurance typically associated with drones			1

@entity24 has invited people to submit ideas for a ' flying aircraft carrier '
the concept resembles @entity3 used in the 2012 film , @entity7
it could overcome *current* limits in speed , range and endurance of drones
project may use a plane like the @entity118 bomber or @entity120
