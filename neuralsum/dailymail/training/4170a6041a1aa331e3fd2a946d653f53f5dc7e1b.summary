he is not , however , the club 's leading shareholder			2
despite that , @entity4 's emergence loan effectively gives him control due to the influence he can now exert			1
the @entity21 owner already has the naming rights to @entity5 and runs the club 's retail division			1
26 per cent of shares - @entity48 ( he is not on the plc board but holds voting rights for 26 per cent of shares )			0
8.92 per cent of shares - @entity4			0
@entity0 was brought in as chief executive last @entity55 chairman @entity54 to lead the restructuring of the club			1
he was criticised by the fans for failing to reveal the true state of the club 's fragile finances , and also found himself at odds with football board chairman @entity63 - who controls a significant 26 per cent stake through shares and proxies - as he tried to push through a £ 16million rescue package being offered by former oldco director @entity69			2
@entity63 , though , was determined to forge an alliance with @entity4 , and the @entity72 tycoon has now got his way			0
@entity0 's only ally on the board , finance director @entity76 , resigned on friday and now he has also decided to walk			2
the @entity11 statement on his departure said : ' @entity2 announces that @entity0 , chief executive officer , has resigned as a director and employee of the company and its subsidiaries with immediate effect			1

@entity4 's £ 2million offer will see @entity2 into the @entity107 and there could be future funding to follow that news of @entity0 's resignation from his £ 315,000 - a - year role was swiftly followed by confirmation of @entity4 's £ 2million interest - free loan			1
it will give @entity2 some much - needed breathing space following rumours the club were due to run out of cash on tuesday			0
@entity121 chief @entity4 - who owns 8.92 per cent of the @entity123 giants - saw off a late bid by @entity126 owner @entity125 to put forward his own emergency loan facility and now has the @entity5 club in his iron - like grasp			1
although @entity4 is prohibited from owning more than 10 per cent of @entity2 while owning @entity21 after he signed an agreement with the @entity131 three years ago , he does run the club 's retail division and holds naming rights to the stadium			1
the terms of his loan now gives him security over the @entity140 and @entity141 facilities on the doorstep of @entity5 - and crucially gives him the power to select @entity0 and @entity76 's board replacements			1
