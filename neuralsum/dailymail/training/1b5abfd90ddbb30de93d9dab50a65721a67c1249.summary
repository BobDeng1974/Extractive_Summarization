@entity1 's move to open relations with @entity3 brought an official weather forecast from @entity6 's state news agency that it would rain flower petals , but @entity3 - @entity8 serving in the @entity9 unleashed a stormy tempest on the @entity11 wednesday			1
the president made his shocking and historic announcement armed with a new budget that seems to cement the @entity16 's ability to fund an embassy and pay salaries in @entity6			1
but while two @entity20 threatened action when the new @entity20 - led @entity22 convenes , they were led by a @entity23 who has backed the @entity11 on nearly everything for the last six years			1
complicating the saga , @entity25 reportedly engineered the @entity3 thaw when she was @entity1 's secretary of state , and she will likely be saddled with it in the 2016 @entity11 race if the effort fails to move the island nation toward @entity33 reforms			1
@entity35 sen. @entity34 lashed out immediately , saying @entity1 'd decision to free three @entity3 spies in exchange for @entity8 aid worker @entity39 had ' vindicated the brutal behavior of the @entity3 government			1
left side ) , @entity57 ( near right ) jumped for joy after their release from @entity8 custody as a condition of @entity3 returning @entity8 aid worker @entity39 to the @entity8			0
@entity66 ( far right ) was convicted along with them but released earlier @entity35 @entity33 senator @entity34 , a @entity68 , disagrees with the president 's position on @entity3 and gave the @entity11 an earful about appeasing dictators on wednesday @entity73 , not broken : @entity45 sen. @entity44 , a @entity20 son of @entity3 emigres , said he would do everything in his power to block the president 's new openness with the @entity81 regime ' trading mr. gross for three convicted criminals sets an extremely dangerous precedent			1
it invites dictatorial and rogue regimes to use @entity8 serving overseas as bargaining chips ' and will ' invite further belligerence toward @entity3 ’s opposition movement and the hardening of the government ’s dictatorial hold on its people , ' @entity34 said			2
speaking of @entity1 's move to normalize diplomatic and trade relations with the communist dictatorship , he claimed ' the @entity8 has just thrown the @entity3 regime an economic lifeline			1
' @entity34 is the outgoing chairman of the @entity99			0
his @entity20 colleagues , @entity101 of @entity102 and @entity44 of @entity45 , are also @entity68 – and they threatened to stop the @entity11 before its plan to open an embassy in @entity6 can gain traction			1
appearing on @entity106 , @entity44 pledged to block the confirmation of any @entity11 nominees to a new post of @entity110 to @entity3			1
' i reserve the right to do everything within the rules of the @entity9 to prevent that sort of individual from ever even coming up for a vote , ' said @entity44 , the son of @entity3 immigrants			1
on the @entity120 , he said wednesday was ' a terrible day for democracy			0
it 's a sad day for those that want freedom and liberty for the @entity3 people			2
' @entity128 madame architect ! @entity25 reportedly engineered @entity1 's @entity3 thaw while she was secretary of state , which could open her up to criticism in a presidential race if the plan flops @entity135 , @entity44 's chief spokesman , told @entity136 that the senator is still exploring practical avenues to block the president , through both the confirmation process and @entity22 ' power of the purse			1
' we 're looking into those questions ourselves , ' he replied to questions about what @entity20 might practically do			0
' but i do n’t see how a nominee to be ambassador to @entity3 gets confirmed in the @entity9 next year			1
' in the past , any single @entity8 senator could block a floor vote on a presidential nomination and force the nominee 's advocates to come up with 60 votes to override his or her action			0
but through outgoing senate majority leader @entity159 's @entity158 's use of what @entity161 wags called the ' nuclear option , ' a simple majority is now all that 's needed to approve a presidential appointee			0
even so , with @entity20 holding 54 seats in the @entity9 that will open for business in january – and some democrats angry about @entity1 's new @entity3 policy – actually confirming a nominee could be impossible			1
@entity101 speculated on @entity106 about @entity9 action that could block the resumption of diplomatic and trade relations with @entity6			1
' it 's not clear at this point where the votes will be , but i expect in the @entity9 to see a far more vigorous voice defending our national security interests , ' he said			2
' and i am hopeful that we will prevent a bad deal and a bad decision			0
the point i was making on this , there ’s a reason why i expect to see bi-partisan cooperation to rein this in			1
in 2009 , the appeasement of @entity188 did n't work and @entity188 invaded @entity189 a sovereign nation			0
' it 's unclear what else @entity22 could do , but some political operatives are buzzing about the power of the purse			0
lawmakers approve the money spent by federal agencies , including the @entity16			0
defiant : @entity102 @entity20 sen. @entity101 said he expects ' bi-partisan cooperation to rein this in ' among senators in january but @entity1 announced his @entity6 shift while his signature on a new federal budget was just days old			1
that document may stymie @entity9 dissenters who just last week would have forbidden secretary of state @entity206 from spending money on a new @entity6 embassy and on salaries to staff it			1
@entity11 press secretary @entity211 thumbed his nose at them during a press briefing on wednesday , suggesting that the administration already has the funds it needs to follow through on the president 's televised announcement since @entity8 personnel have been on the ground there for some time			2
' as a point of fact , it ’s not clear to me that additional appropriations will be necessary to establish an embassy in @entity3 , ' @entity211 said , ' principally because there is already a significant diplomatic presence in @entity3			0
' ' there is an @entity230 there that represents the interests of the @entity8			0
so i do n’t know of any specific appropriations request that has been made			0
there may be one in the future			0
' @entity237 @entity33 sen. @entity236 , the @entity238 's outgoing chairman and one of the lawmakers who accompanied @entity39 back to the @entity8 on wednesday , said it would be ' really , really foolish ' to normalize relations with @entity3 while no ambassador is in place			2
and @entity246 @entity245 sen. @entity245 , who has tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to rally support behind legislation to change @entity8 - @entity3 policy , said ' it would be really counterproductive to block funding for an embassy			1
' ' we 're going to have a lot more @entity8 traveling to @entity3			0
… to tell those @entity8 who travel there , you 're out of luck if you have a problem , i just do n't think that 's right			0
@entity261 : @entity1 surprised @entity161 and the world by announcing that he would scrap the 53 - year - old policy of detachment from the communist country of @entity3 however @entity8 - @entity3 relations sort out , @entity25 will get much of the credit or blame			1
from 2009 until her departure early last year , then - secretary of state @entity269 took the lead when the @entity1 administration interfaced with @entity3 officials , according to @entity274			1
@entity11 and @entity16 officials and others told @entity274 that @entity269 pushed hard for the administration to end the half - century - old bans on tourism and trade with the island communist state			2
while some in the @entity11 resisted her pressure , her brainchild ultimately came to fruition this week			0
' @entity25 played a very large role , ' @entity287 senior fellow @entity286 told the news outlet			0
' @entity3 was on her mind , ' he said , referring to her final year in office			0
' i know that she raised it a number of times			0
the @entity11 was n’t ready to move but she kept that in play			0
' and @entity296 , then assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs and @entity269 's top cuba - policy aide , said ' there was strong support in the @entity16 for liberalizing some of the restrictions and secretary @entity269 was quite clear about that			2
' trade relations with the island dictatorship just 90 miles from @entity45 are governed by the 1996 @entity304 , which strengthening the trade embargo first put in place by president @entity307			0
only @entity22 can overturn that law – a near - impossibility with strong @entity20 majorities in both houses when the 114th @entity22 convenes just weeks from now			2
but @entity20 leaders seem to concede that nothing @entity1 promised on wednesday goes beyond what @entity304 permits			2
' it 's not like he 's thrown the door open to @entity3 cigars coming into @entity45 and @entity320 going to @entity6 , ' an aide to a senior @entity11 @entity20 told @entity321			1
' but the danger , now that @entity1 has moved the goalposts , is what the next @entity33 administration and the next @entity33 @entity22 could do			2

@entity101 , @entity44 and @entity34 bashed the @entity11 's thaw with the @entity81 regime
the two @entity20 threatened to block the president in the new @entity20 - led @entity22 while @entity34 , a @entity23 , had the harshest words for @entity1
@entity44 warned he will try to block funding for a @entity6 embassy and *cautioned* that the @entity9 must confirm any new ambassadors
' i do n’t see how a nominee to be ambassador to @entity3 gets confirmed in the @entity9 next year , ' his spokesman told @entity321
@entity101 said ' i expect to see bi-partisan cooperation to rein this in '
the @entity11 *insists* , though , that it does n't need any new money to carry out @entity1 's plan since the ' @entity346 ' budget is now law
@entity25 reportedly engineered the @entity3 thaw when she was @entity1 's secretary of state , and will be saddled with it in the 2016 @entity11 race if it fails
