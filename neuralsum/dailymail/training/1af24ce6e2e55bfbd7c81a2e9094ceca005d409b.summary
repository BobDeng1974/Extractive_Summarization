by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 1 november 2013 the skyscraper has long been symbolic of a city ’s wealth and power – and something that defines a skyline			0
throughout the 20th century , it was @entity8 that held the skyscraper crown			0
its skyline was what most people imagined a modern city to look like			0
just 13 years into the new century and although the @entity8 skyline is finally recovering from 9 - 11 , if bigger really is better there is only one direction to head in - @entity18			0
the title holder at present is the @entity47 in @entity48 at 2,716 feet ( 828 metres ) , which towers over the building that was for so long the world 's tallest , @entity8 's @entity51 , which was 1,250 feet originally , but increased by a new antenna in 1950 to 1,467 feet			1
the taller of the old twin towers of the @entity55 was 1727 feet to the top of its antenna , while in @entity59 , the @entity60 , the old title holder in the @entity62 at 771 feet has just been surpassed by the @entity63 which is 1,004 feet high			2
the @entity65 will be the second tallest in the world when completed in 2014 the @entity67 in @entity68 is one of four @entity28 super-skyscrapers planned and under construction however all these , including the @entity48 tower will be dwarfed by the @entity20 currently under construction in another @entity74 , @entity75			1
this building , at the centre of a massive development in @entity21 will be 1,000 metres ( 3,281 feet ) high when completed			1
the third supertall building in the @entity18 is the ' @entity80 ' in @entity81 at 1,972 feet , which has the world 's largest clock face			0
behind the three middle eastern buildings come a whole clutch of buildings underway across the far east , with four supertall skyscrapers going up in @entity28 , towers in @entity85 , and only one real challenger from the ' old west ' , in the shape of the @entity55 replacement in @entity8 , the @entity90 at 1,775 feet			2
@entity81 's @entity96 hotel became third highest building in the world in 2012 at 1,972 feet ( 601 metres ) behind only @entity48 's @entity99 and @entity28 's @entity65 tower @entity90 was conceived as a defiant riposte to the terrorist attacks that destroyed the twin towers the @entity104 ( named after the company and the number of floors in the building ) will be the tallest building in the @entity28 city of @entity111 at 1,959 feet ( 597 metres ) presently number one in the world , @entity48 's @entity112 measures 2,716 feet ( 828 metres ) with 162 floors @entity48 's @entity112 featured in the latest @entity117 film , which saw @entity119 's character clambering around outside near the top floor although taller than the old @entity55 it still lags behind those developments beginning to carpet @entity123 on the list			1
there ’s @entity127 's ' @entity65 ' at 2,067 feet , soon to be second to @entity128 ( but quickly third behind the @entity20 )			1
@entity130 , in @entity28 's @entity27 province has planned ' @entity24 ' for 2,749 feet to take the present title , although this project has run into trouble and delays			1
@entity111 in @entity28 , meanwhile , is building the ' @entity135 ' to 1,959 feet , the ' @entity67 ' in @entity68 , @entity28 , is another over 2,000 feet at 2,087 and @entity85 is constructing the ' @entity136 ' in @entity137 to 1,824 feet			2
with the activity ever more concentrated in the @entity74 and @entity140 it means soon the @entity141 , and @entity8 , the home of the skyscraper , will only have the ' @entity90 ' in the world 's top ten while the @entity62 wo n't be anywhere near the top 60			0
the @entity63 is a mere 1,004 feet high - but that 's enough to dominate the @entity59 skyline			0

the @entity20 in @entity75 will be one kilometre tall - or 3,281 feet
' @entity24 ' in @entity28 will become the second tallest building at 2,749 feet
the current record holder is the @entity128 in @entity48 , at 2,716 feet
