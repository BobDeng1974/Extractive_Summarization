she added that mrs @entity81 had said a glass of wine , paid for by the school , would be permitted			2

mr @entity66 told the tribunal : ' she still ca n't accept that she did anything wrong and i think it 's appalling			0
' she brought the school into disrepute			0
she was in breach of the trust of the school and the parents and her conduct could have led to a serious injury to a student who , under the influence of alcohol , could have wandered out of the restaurant and into the path of a car which could have closed the school down			0
