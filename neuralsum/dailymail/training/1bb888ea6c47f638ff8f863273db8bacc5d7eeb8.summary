by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity5 's @entity4 return can give them a platform for a @entity8 comeback			1
the former @entity5 manager wants the club to unite ahead of their homecoming against @entity12 on friday			1
it will end a 13 - month exile in @entity15 after a rent dispute with the stadium 's owners , @entity19 , saw them to play 35 miles away			1
but @entity2 , who also made 200 appearances for the club in two spells , thinks the return can provide a catalyst for success			1
' it 's a one - club city and they do n't want to get ahead of themselves but @entity5 have a proud history in the @entity8 , ' he told @entity1			1
' it was a club who were established in the @entity8 , there were flirtations with relegation but they managed to stave it off until they went down ( in 2001 )			1
i remember one particular escape at @entity39 ( in 1997 )			0
' i hope this pulls everyone together and i 'm sure they will get some proper attendances now			0
there 's a good hardcore fanbase in @entity5 and they can use that to push back up to where they should be			2
' captain : @entity2 ( right ) is embedded in @entity5 's history after two spells as a player and one as manager hopeful : @entity2 ( left ) alongside @entity57 ( right ) of @entity58 during their playing days manager : @entity2 ( left ) was not only a player - he managed the club between 2002 - 2004 @entity2 was boss at @entity61 while plans for the @entity4 were put in place but left a year before they moved in during the 2005 - 06 season			1
but he can recall the anticipation around the club as they prepared to move from their home of 106 years			2
' it 's been quite sad seeing the @entity5 fans up on that bank at @entity74			2
i was a fan of @entity61 , i liked the atmosphere but it was an old stadium , ' said the ex-leeds and @entity80 midfielder , who was in charge of @entity5 between 2002 and 2004			1
' it was exciting , @entity61 had served them well but the club needed to move forwards yet it sent them into a downward spiral			0
with the way it was structured it became very messy and difficult to understand from the outside			0
' i 'd gone by the time the team went there but i 've been invited back and it 's a magnificent stadium			0
' i know how passionate the @entity5 fans are and i had good years there ; we had a fantastic side which played nice football and it 's good too see they are home			1
' the @entity5 are 15th in @entity102 after finishing 18th last season , following a 10 point deduction for exiting administration without agreeing a @entity106			2
@entity107 had been heavily linked with the @entity109 job before @entity110 was appointed and @entity2 knows his fellow @entity111 has not gone unnoticed			2
' it 's no surprise when a job comes up @entity115 's name is mentioned and that 's going to continue to happen , ' he said			0
' people are aware of what he 's done under very difficult circumstances			0
' home : the @entity5 will make a triumphant return to the @entity19 this week , after 13 months away legend : @entity5 hero @entity123 ( right ) with @entity125 's @entity124 ( left ) and former @entity61 favourite @entity123 agreed			1
@entity123 , who made 109 appearances and scored 34 goals during three years with the @entity5 , also feels they must escape the third tier			1
' the manger has done a good job under difficult circumstances and a lot would not have had it , ' said the 38 - year - old			0
' they have to try to get out of @entity102 and back into the @entity135 because a club of their stature and history should not be knocking around @entity102			0
' and bringing players in now will be more attractive			0
i do n't know what their financial situation is , i 'm sure they will be reserved , but showing players around the @entity4 is better than 35 miles away			0
' i 'd like to think it should n't have got to that stage but everyone stuck to their guns			0
' a club of @entity5 's size should not be messing about at other people 's stadiums			2

@entity5 have been playing their home games in @entity15
they were made to play there because of a dispute with stadium owners
this friday sees them return to their @entity19 home
@entity2 believes this could kick - start a return to the @entity8
@entity2 made 200 appearances for the @entity5 , and has managed them
