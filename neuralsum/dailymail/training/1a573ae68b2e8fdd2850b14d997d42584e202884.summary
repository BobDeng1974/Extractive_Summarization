by @entity0 a £ 6 million party funded by the @entity2 for 5,000 young people this weekend caused a headache for the @entity5 : what if it all got out of hand ? so , to avoid doubt , the organisers issued an edict – do n’t have an orgy without the strict consent of all those involved			2
the three - day @entity14 in @entity15 is being held to teach 16 to 30 - year - olds from across the @entity2 about ‘ common @entity18 values ’			1
the 16 to 30 - year - olds attending a youth event at the @entity21 in @entity15 were issued adivce warning them not to have sex with other participants without getting consent from all involved but with all those hormones flying around , organisers felt obliged to warn participants : ‘ do not engage in any sexual activities without obtaining explicit and informed consent of all persons present			1
’ @entity31 , @entity32 deputy leader , called the advice ' mind - boggling ' and branded the whole exercise a ' propaganda event ' the advice , contained in the 171 - page event guide , goes on : ‘ be aware that personal boundaries are different and not everyone enjoys the same level of physical contact			1
‘ consider this in your interactions and remember that others may misinterpret your actions			2
be aware that some participants are under 18			0
' act in accordance with any applicable laws and avoid situations where positions of trust can be misused			0
’ the advice led to ridicule from @entity32 deputy leader @entity31 , who said : ‘ it is mind - boggling that they want to give advice about having sex on the premises			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity63 bureaucrats have a neck spending millions on a propaganda event to make young people love the @entity2 when youth unemployment is reaching 60 per cent in @entity68 and @entity69			0
it is a scandalous waste of money			0
’ a @entity21 spokesman did not respond to a request for comment .			0
