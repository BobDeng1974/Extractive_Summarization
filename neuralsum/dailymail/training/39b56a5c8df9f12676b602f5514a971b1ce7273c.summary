in the aftermath of a fine victory , @entity0 left @entity3 to ponder an old truth			1
in football , as in life , you reap what you @entity8			1
rebuilt and remoulded in the post-script to relegation and administration , @entity0 laid down a marker for the @entity15 season with a display of composure and menace			1
they may have lost their keeper @entity19 for a month with a fractured cheekbone sustained in a clash with his own player			0
delight : @entity8 celebrates his last - gasp winner while @entity27 wheels away in delight after making it 1 - 1 but in defence their central defenders @entity32 and @entity33 dominated @entity35 and @entity36 while , in attack @entity8 , a 6ft 4in @entity38 striker starting his first competitive match in over a year , struck a deserved injury - time winner			1
‘ @entity8 has come in and shown his qualities , ’ said head coach @entity41 afterwards with marked understatement			1
‘ he needs more fitness but he has pace , strength , good technique and an eye for goal and i think he ’ll scare a lot of defenders this season			2
’ he certainly frightened the life out of @entity54 and @entity55			0
@entity56 was critical of the defending for both @entity0 goals , the first a meat and drink header from skipper @entity32 from a corner in 52 minutes			1
the home team believed they had claimed a late point when @entity27 responded to howls of derision over his sponsors ’ man of the match award by hooking an equaliser as the board went up for six minutes of added time			1
yet , incredibly , @entity0 scored straight from kick - off by exploiting the departure of @entity3 right - back @entity72 to attack the area where his replacement @entity74 should have been			1
@entity8 took a couple of touches and slotted a composed finish low in the net for 2 - 1			1
‘ of course it ’s unacceptable , ’ said @entity56 afterwards			0
‘ they always say you are at your most vulnerable after you score but , to be honest , i ’ve never been on the receiving end of that			0
‘ to have got back into what was a hard game against a team who will be one of our main rivals for the league this year , it was really disappointing			0
’ concentration : @entity0 skipper @entity32 gestures to members of his team during the game at @entity98 asked if @entity74 should have been quicker taking up position , @entity56 opted to spread the blame			1
‘ if you see @entity74 , he ’s coming across and maybe he ’s not had much time to react to it , but we had plenty in our team who could have got back and the whole process of losing that goal was very disappointing			0
’ for @entity8 , all of this was remarkable stuff			1
after joining @entity112 last summer he failed to start a single game			2
yet his performance and goal here showed signs of real promise			0
laid back so as to be almost horizontal , he was completely unconcerned when @entity3 equalised and @entity98 roused itself for an anticipated @entity3 winner			1
‘ i just thought : “ this is our three points , ” he said			1
the atmosphere was great , but all three points are the same in the end			0
‘ i ’m just happy we got them here , it was good to get a win as early as possible			0
’ clinical : law fires home from close range to give @entity3 a foothold back into the game almost the prototype @entity136 striker – tall , powerful – @entity8 did n’t need much persuading to join @entity0			1
@entity3 supporters , by contrast , were left to ponder if this is the kind of imaginative signing they might make if they had a scouting network			1
‘ i was a free agent and had some other opportunities to go back to @entity38			0
but i want to make my career here in the @entity147 , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ my last competitive game was maybe a year ago last summer for @entity149 in the @entity38 league before i joined @entity112			0
this was my first start in a while			0
’ the afternoon began with a warm tribute to the late @entity155 as @entity3 honoured the man who played over 800 games for the club by renaming the @entity159 in his honour			1
former team - mates from the club ’s @entity163 triumph of 1972 gathered around the centre circle			0
for only the second time since his resignation from the @entity3 board in protest at @entity172 ’s stewardship of the club , @entity166 attended a match at @entity98			1
deserved : hearts took a 1 - 0 lead courtesy of @entity32 early on in the second half the gesture was a one - off to honour @entity155 albeit he declined the invitation to join the @entity181 on the pitch			0
after 27 minutes he did make an appearance on the large @entity98 screens to unanimous acclaim			2
by then @entity3 had wasted chances to take the lead			2
in 18 minutes @entity188 , one of four former @entity0 players in the @entity3 starting 11 , blew the best one by far			1
@entity191 , one of the brighter players for @entity3 , did well to create a shooting chance for @entity36			2
the former @entity196 man ’s prodded shot spun up towards the back post after an @entity33 block , falling perfectly for @entity188 to head inexplicably over the bar from eight yards			0
he only had to hit the target			0
provocatively , @entity0 coach @entity41 had spoken pre-match of training with 10 men against 11 , because in his view ‘ that ’s how it is ’ against @entity3 at @entity98			1
it looked for a time as if his mind games might become a prescient prediction			0
respect : @entity3 fans hold up cards to make a mosaic in the newly renamed @entity155 stand @entity215 was booked early in the game and before 35 minutes were played the dangerous @entity8 and @entity217 had joined him in the book			1
around the same time , however , the visitors began to settle and play some football			0
@entity8 ’s lofted cross from the left in 41 minutes deserved more than a weak downward header from @entity224			2
and @entity0 had loud calls for a penalty before half - time after some fine passing ended in @entity224 crumpling to the deck under a challenge from @entity231			1
referee @entity232 said no penalty			0
but @entity0 were growing in stature			2
they began the second half boldly and claimed the lead in 52 minutes with a simple goal			0
@entity224 ’s corner in front of the @entity240 looped into the area , picking out the leaping figure of @entity0 skipper @entity32			2
the defender ’s downward header took a nick off @entity247 , but silenced @entity98 as it nestled in the back of the net			2
@entity250 : @entity56 shakes hands with counterpart @entity41 after a disappointing start to the season hearts lived dangerously thereafter , but nowhere near as perilously as @entity56 might have liked			0
@entity3 , frankly , created precious little			2
@entity41 ’s side survived a desperate penalty box scramble in 57 minutes when @entity191 ’s corner was turned towards goal by @entity54 , then @entity35 , before @entity0 somehow managed to whack the ball clear through a forest of flailing legs in desperate circumstances			1
they were n’t out of the woods yet			0
in 66 minutes goalkeeper @entity19 was stretchered from the field following a clash of heads with @entity33 , his own defender			0
@entity268 , the replacement who left @entity3 by mutual consent last season , was hastily summoned from the bench			2
he probably expected a rougher ride than he got			0
he was finally beaten in injury time when @entity27 hooked the home team level after @entity36 knocked down a long , raking , @entity247 long ball			2
by allowing @entity8 to run free from the kick off , however , @entity3 made a pig ’s ear of the situation			1
the goalscorer ’s display here suggested bad pig puns could be a feature of the @entity15 season .			0

summer signing @entity8 scored a last - gasp winner for @entity0 at @entity98
@entity27 thought he had *salvaged* a point for @entity3 with a late equaliser
the away side were good value for the three points after a dominant display
