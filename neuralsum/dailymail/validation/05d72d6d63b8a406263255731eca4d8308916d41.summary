a 20 - year - old @entity2 satellite has exploded in space , adding 43 pieces of space junk to @entity7 ’s orbit , reports have claimed			1
the explosion happened on 3 february due to a sudden temperature spike , although the event has only just come to light			1
however , talking to @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 said the catastrophic event posed no significant risk to other satellites in @entity7 orbit			1
a @entity20 @entity2 satellite has exploded 500 miles above @entity7 's surface			1
an unknown ' temperature spike ' caused the explosion of the @entity24 13 ( @entity25 )			1
one of the series of satellites is illustrated here			0
this has resulted in 43 new pieces of debris in @entity7 orbit the previously unknown incident was revealed by @entity32 , after posing questions to @entity34			1
known as the @entity36 13 ( @entity25 ) , it was launched back in 1995 and had remained in operation until now			0
since the first object , @entity40 1 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris			0
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and hundreds of thousands more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			2
one major source of debris in the past was a @entity64 anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere			1
accidental events have also contributed to the problem			0
in 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a @entity20 communications satellite and a defunct @entity75 military probe over @entity76			1
some tentative solutions to clear up space junk have been suggested - such as using nets to scoop some up - but nothing has been tried so far			0
this made it the oldest continuously operational satellite in this particular series of satellites			2
exactly what has happened to the satellite , though , is still not clear , with the temperature spike remaining a mystery			1
@entity34 said the power subsystem experienced ' a sudden spike in temperature '			2
this was followed by ' an unrecoverable loss of altitude control ' , before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially exploded			1
part of the satellite still seems to be intact , however , as it is sending and receiving signals - although @entity12 said it was ' unrecoverable '			0
speaking to @entity12 , @entity104 , chief of the @entity105 at @entity34 , said the fault was likely due to the satellite reaching the end of its operational life time			0
‘ a thermal spike can be caused by a variety of things from on board anomaly to space environment changes , ’ he said			2
‘ in this case we believe the satellite was wearing down			0
the satellite had already exceeded its design life three times over providing thousands of hours of weather imagery			0
‘ prior to the power failure , the satellite had already lost its primary mission capability and so it provided limited operational capability			0
’ in addition , the satellite was still sufficiently intact to be sending and receiving signals from @entity7 , although ‘ operators determined that @entity131 13 had suffered damage to the power system rendering the satellite unrecoverable			2
' @entity34 said the power subsystem experienced ' a sudden spike in temperature '			2
this was followed by ' an unrecoverable loss of altitude control ' , before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially , or completely , exploded ( stock illustration shown ) six other @entity25 satellites are in orbit , while a seventh is scheduled to launch in 2016			1
the @entity2 played down the significance of the event , and said that the loss of the satellite - which had been retired to a back - up role - would not be detrimental to any of their operations			1
‘ because this satellite was no longer used by the @entity159 or the @entity160 , the impact of the loss of this satellite is minimal , ’ the @entity2 told @entity32			1
‘ we anticipate real - time weather data for tactical users will be slightly reduced without this satellite , but its data was not being used for weather forecast modelling			0
’ however , the main fear from such an event is the increase in the amount of debris into @entity7 orbit			1
previous explosions in orbit , most notably the accidental collision of a @entity20 @entity177 satellite and a defunct @entity179 satellite in 2009 , have released hundreds of pieces of debris into orbit			1
another notable event was a @entity64 anti-satellite missile test in 2007 , when they blew up one of their own satellites , which was widely condemned			0
this raises the risk of a collision in future , and even the @entity193 occasionally has to perform manoeuvres to avoid space debris			2
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track ( illustration shown ) and hundreds of thousands more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			2
this latest explosion is not thought to pose a significant risk , though but speaking to @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 played down the risk of any potential issue			1
‘ if the reported fragment numbers are stable , then the event is not considered major , ’ said dr @entity210 , head of @entity14 ’s @entity211			2
‘ what makes this event special is that the break - up obviously happened while the satellite was still operational			0
' dr @entity210 noted that the explosion occurred above 500 miles ( 800km ) , where few other satellites were in orbit			1
indeed , @entity14 ’s closest mission is @entity224 , at an altitude of 450 miles ( 720km ) , so dr @entity210 said they ‘ do not expect any meaningful risk increase due to this event			1
’ the @entity25 programme is used to monitor meteorological , oceanographic and solar - terrestrial physics for the @entity20 @entity231			0
it is managed by @entity34 , with on - orbit operarions provided by @entity234			0
shown is a rendering of lights on @entity7 using @entity25 observations dr @entity239 , program manager of @entity13 ’s @entity240 , added : ‘ the debris cloud from this event is obviously much smaller than the @entity64 @entity244 test of 2007 or the @entity177 / @entity179 collision of 2009			1
‘ we have collected additional measurements to more fully characterize the event , but the data has not been processed yet			0
‘ depending on what size you go down to , there are many thousands to millions of debris in orbit			0
this is a small increase to an existing risk to other spacecraft			0
’ and mr @entity104 noted that the satellite would gradually decay from its current orbit until it re-entered the atmosphere , so was unlikely to significantly contribute to the space junk problem .			0

a @entity20 @entity2 satellite has exploded 500 miles above @entity7 's surface
an unknown ' temperature spike ' caused the explosion
this has resulted in 43 new pieces of debris in @entity7 orbit
the @entity2 said the loss of the satellite was not a major concern
and @entity13 and @entity14 played down the risk to other satellites in orbit
