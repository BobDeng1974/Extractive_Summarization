cholesterol - busting statins could reverse learning disabilities in children and adults , scientists believe			1
more than one in every 2,500 children are born with the genetic disorder @entity7			2
it causes unusual facial features , such as drooping eyelids or a wider than usual distance between the eyes , restricted growth , heart defects and mild learning difficulties			1
the condition is currently incurable , although scientists have identified eight specific genetic mutations that cause the syndrome			1
now tests in mice treated with lovastatin found the drug boosted memory and cognitive ability and promises to help children overcome their learning difficulties			1
scientists in @entity30 have found the drug lovastatin boost memory and cognitive function in those diagnosed with @entity35 's syndrome , an incurable condition which causes mild learning difficulties			1
file picture professor of neurobiology , psychiatry and psychology @entity42 at @entity44 , said : ' @entity7 affects one in 2,000 people , and up to half of these patients struggle with learning disabilities			2
' our approach identified the mechanism causing the disease , as well as a treatment that reversed its effects in adult mice			0
' we are excited about these findings , because they suggest that the treatment we developed may help the millions of @entity35 patients with intellectual disabilities			1
' neuroscientists found statins reversed the learning deficits caused by a mutation linked to a common genetic cause of learning disabilities , the study published online in @entity62 found			2
while many genes contribute to @entity35 syndrome , a single gene causes about half of all cases			1
this gene encodes for a protein that regulates another protein called @entity76 , which controls how brain cells talk to each other , enabling learning to take place			0
it was discovered that the @entity35 mutation creates hyperactive @entity76 , which disrupts cellular conversations and undermines the learning process			1
professor @entity42 said : ' the act of learning creates physical changes in the brain , much like grooves on a record			0
noonan syndrome affects one in every 2,000 people			0
file picture ' @entity93 tips the balance between switching signals on and off in the brain			0
' this interrupts the delicate cell communication needed by the brain to record learned information			0
' dr @entity101 added : ' @entity102 signaling in the brain is to blame for @entity35 's neurological and behavioural symptoms			2
' an overabundance of @entity93 prematurely alters the brain 's synapses , leaving no place for the brain to record the changes necessary for learning			0
' statin drugs lower cholesterol by blocking the synthesis of certain fat molecules that @entity76 requires to function			1
the resulting drop in @entity76 activity allows brain cells to communicate properly , allowing normal learning to take place			0
professor @entity42 said : ' @entity7 interferes with the changes in brain cells needed for learning , which results in learning deficits			0
' statins act on the root of the problem and reverse these deficits			0
this enables the process of learning to physically change the brain and create memory			2
' when the @entity134 team treated adult @entity35 mice with lovastatin , they discovered that the drop in @entity76 activity dramatically improved the animals ' memory and ability to remember objects and navigate mazes			1
she added : ' we were amazed to see that statin treatment restored the adult animals ' cognitive functions to normal			0
' traditionally , science assumes that therapy needs to start in the foetal stage to be effective			0
' our research suggests that the leading gene mutation responsible for @entity35 syndrome plays critical roles not only in foetal development , but also in how well the adult brain functions			1
