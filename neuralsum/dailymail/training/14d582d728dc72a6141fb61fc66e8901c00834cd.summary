a plane - load of @entity2 schoolgirls were left fearing for their lives after the landing gear on their damaged aircraft buckled after it touched down on a frozen airfield			1
the small propeller plane , carrying the volleyball team for @entity11 school near @entity12 , southwestern @entity2 , skidded 1,000ft down the runway , with sparks flying , before coming to a halt			1
the twin - engine @entity17 craft , which was taking the team to @entity20 for a tournament , broke the landing gear on its left side upon take - off , trapping the pilot and passengers airborne in the damaged plane			1
emergency landing : the twin - propeller plane had broken landing gear , which failed during a landing at @entity33 airport in @entity2 broken gear : the plane 's left wheel , which hit a mud bank during take - off from a bad runway , failed to retract in flight , and did n't hold out when the plane landed its wheels hit a mud bank on the bumpy runway when the plane took off from remote @entity48 airport , and would n't retract when the pilot tried to move them , the @entity42 reported			1
a tense journey followed in which the plane headed for a neighboring airport so ground crew could assess the damage as the aircraft flew overhead			1
after officials saw the landing gear hanging off the plane at a dangerous angle , the pilot chose to fly half an hour southwest to @entity33 , because they could deal better with a potential crash			2
the pilot , @entity64 , told the girls , their parents and support staff on board to brace before the landing , as he was certain the landing gear would buckle			2
@entity71 , a setter on the team , told local news station @entity74 : ' it was really scary because we never experience this before - we were all nervous about what would happen			0
' keeping on : the volleyball team , pictured above , were able to play their matches after continuing to @entity20 when the plane touched down , the wheels held for a few seconds , but the then plane tilted , starting on its lengthy ski down the runway as fire trucks and ambulances raced towards the downed plane			2
nobody was hurt in the accident , potentially because the smooth , icy runway meant the plane could slide smoothly rather than coming to a rough stop			0
the team members were then flown on to @entity20 and were able to compete as planned			0
assistant coach @entity94 said : ' our girls are really strong			0
' the pilot was really nice			0
he said he was sorry it happened today but he could nâ€™t have had better passengers			0

team from @entity11 were headed to tournament in @entity20
plane hit bump on takeoff and left wheel of landing gear broke
pilot *circled* while ground crew assessed the damage to wheels
eventually made the landing , wheel gave out and plane skidded 1,000ft
nobody was hurt in the crash , and girls still played in *competition*
