by @entity1 reporter published : 23:50 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 23:52 est , 20 october 2013 @entity2 might soon get a new type of subway car that allows more circulation in trains			0
@entity8 officials are envisioning a subway car of the future that will end the era of the captive car			2
a 142 - page document released this month outlines the needs for the next 20 years , in which the authority noted the benefits of articulated trains			1
the trains are similar to accordion - style buses that have no doors between cars , allowing unrestricted flow throughout the length of the subway			1
new subway cars : the idea is to have articulated trains similar to accordion - style buses that have no doors between cars , allowing unrestricted flow , like this train in @entity33 , @entity34 this is a similar model adopted in cities like @entity33 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
according to the authority , the move will ‘ both maximize carrying capacity ’ and allow passengers to ‘ move to less - crowded areas of the train , balancing loading and unloading times at all doors ’			1
it will also provide refuge from mariachi bands , other performers and preachers of all types , commonly seen roaming throughout the @entity2 subway system , if people so choose to escape			1
the cost difference between the current model and the proposed models has not been made clear			0
@entity58 , the authority ’s chief spokesman , said that increased capacity could improve ‘ dwell time ’ , which is the period during which a train is stopped in a station , often because of overcrowding - and allow more trains to run , according to the @entity64			1
he cautioned , though , that with a 109 - year - old system , any major change required extensive review			0
‘ if you make a bad call on changing equipment in a new subway car order , ’ he said , ‘ the consequences can be pretty serious			0
’ crowded : the move will allow passengers to move to less - crowded areas of the train , balancing loading and unloading times at all doors ¿ and find refuge from performers , if they wish freedom : the new cars would allow passengers to move throughout the train			1
here , a break dancer performs in a subway car in @entity2 in 1924 , the @entity88 introduced plans for the ‘ triplex ’ , with a hinged , multi-sectioned body			0
it operated on the @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , q and r lines for 40 years , representing ‘ the height of transit modernity ’ at a moment when elevated lines often still featured wooden cars , according to the @entity103			2
today , many of the city ’s subway cars are well past their prime , most strikingly those on the c line , known by their model number , @entity111 , and for the tin - can siding that will continue rolling beneath @entity113 for at least a few more years , said the @entity64			2
follow suit : this is a similar model adopted in cities like @entity33 , @entity37 and @entity38 , pictured behind the rest : @entity118 , director of transportation programs at the @entity120 , says the current trains ¿ don ¿ t function right now to allow people to circulate ' transit planners have urged the authority to consider articulated trains for future fleet upgrades			1
‘ we ’re one of the largest systems in the world that does n’t do it , ’ said @entity118 , the director of transportation programs at the @entity120			0
‘ our trains do n’t function right now to allow people to circulate			2
’ @entity135 , a member of the transportation authority ’s board , recalled that separated cars had served another purpose for the city in a different age			0
‘ remember the time when we were in the high - crime era and gangs were roaming through the trains ? ’ he said			2
‘ everybody loved the locked end doors			0
’ the report from the transport authority does not state when the project would come into effect and start rolling on the tracks under @entity2 .			0
