by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 5 august 2013 when it comes to fashion , @entity1 has always been very much her own woman			0
but it seems she may have drawn on a little @entity7 inspiration for her outfit at the @entity9 over the weekend			0
unfortunately for @entity1 , she appeared to have followed in the footsteps of @entity11 in her rather unusual choice			0
uncanny : princess @entity1 's casual androgynous look ( left ) bore a striking resemblance to @entity11 's trademark tattered suit ( right ) the princess royal , 62 , was resplendent in a blue and grey striped hat , a navy blue blazer , striped shirt , blue chinos and leather loafers			1
and when she leaned on an umbrella , the likeness to the @entity25 star of the silent movie era was complete			0
she did , however , show off a dazzling smile , something of a rarity for the usually stern @entity1			0
she joined her daughter , @entity31 , who was riding her horse @entity32 at the trials on saturday			1
family affair : the princess royal joined her daughter @entity31 , who was riding in the @entity9 @entity31 , 32 , who is expecting her first baby with husband @entity38 , rode dressage for a panel of judges in a ‘ guinea pig ’ trial designed to help them mark the riders			1
@entity31 ’s appearance came after she decided to give up competitive riding for the remainder of her pregnancy			1
princess @entity1 is known for being the thriftiest member of the @entity51 and is a keen recycler of outfits			2
time for a cull ? princess @entity1 is notoriously spendthrift and has often broken fashion 's first rule of only wearing an outfit once			2
she first wore this outfit in 1990 ( left ) and it reappeared 20 years later in 2010 ( right ) she recently appeared in a yellow hat that she had first worn to @entity31 ’s christening			1
so if the hat she wore to the horse trials looked a little battered around the edges , there is no doubt it has probably had quite a bit of wear before			2
when asked once about her thriftiness with clothes , the princess explained that the @entity70 , something of a style icon herself , had brought her up not to be wasteful .			0
