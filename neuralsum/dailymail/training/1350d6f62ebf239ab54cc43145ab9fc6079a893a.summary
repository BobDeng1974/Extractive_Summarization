@entity1 is on his way to @entity3 , we are told			1
not just for @entity4 , as the deficiencies in his squad bite			2
executive vice-chairman @entity7 must also start landing the big ones if he is to remain in his elevated role at @entity10			1
the buck wo n’t stop with the manager this time , if @entity3 fall short			1
after @entity15 ’s dramatic intervention last season , @entity3 can not continue sacking highly paid coaches to cure dysfunction			1
sooner or later , they have to address a wider issue : the capability of the man charged with making the signings			2
arrival : @entity1 touched down in @entity24 on tuesday ahead of a move to @entity3 nearly there : @entity1 ( left ) arrives for his medical in @entity28 on tuesday ahead of his move to @entity3 thumbs up : @entity1 ( left ) tweeted a photo as he boarded a plane to @entity28 ahead of his move to the club incoming : if @entity3 do not sign @entity1 and others then @entity7 's job could be on the line this time admin man : @entity7 ( left ) got away with struggling last season , but may not survive if @entity3 fail again proven : @entity4 's track record suggests he will not be solely to blame if @entity3 fail again this year @entity7 got away with it under @entity43			1
he failed to deliver in his new role every bit as much as the manager , but had huge credit with the @entity48 from his previous work at the club			0
it was easier to remove @entity43 and keep the executive who had almost doubled @entity3 ’s commercial revenue			1
@entity55 ’s track record , however , makes him an unlikely fall guy			1
there was no prior evidence that @entity43 was a title - winning manager , but that is not true of @entity55			1
history suggests that given the tools , he succeeds			0
this time the blame rebounds on his floundering facilitator			0
the @entity48 will not wish to lose the services of the admired @entity15 - but they may prefer him to return to his area of expertise			0
last summer was a bust , the winter bought @entity72 at vast expense and now @entity3 are running out of time again as the window closes			2
shock : @entity3 continued their poor form from last season with a 2 - 1 opening day home defeat to @entity79 versatile : @entity1 can play at left back but is likely to be one of three centre backs in @entity55 's 3 - 5 - 2 system three 's up : @entity1 is on his way to @entity10 as @entity3 's third signing of the summer - but their first since june @entity87 reach deal for @entity1 there has been no transfer activity since june and , even allowing for injuries , @entity3 ’s weakened state is troubling			1
it was never going to be easy to replace @entity93 and @entity94 , but at least the club had lead time			1
it has been known for eight months that @entity93 was leaving and @entity94 ’s performances increasingly represented the end of an era			2
there should have been planning			0
@entity1 and @entity103 of @entity104 , should have already been in the team come saturday ’s match with @entity79			0
the pursuit of @entity108 would appear to be a recent , opportunistic request by @entity55			0
after an outstanding season with @entity111 , few would have thought he would be available this summer			0
it makes sense to take advantage of @entity111 ’s overcrowded roster			0
slow to act : @entity3 have failed to replace @entity94 ( left ) or @entity93 ( right ) in defence this season world star : @entity1 was a member of the @entity119 squad that finished as runners up at this summer 's @entity121 overhaul : @entity3 and @entity55 need to strengthen the squad in order to tackle some serious deficiencies yet replacing @entity93 and @entity94 ? that should have been done long ago			1
shorn of @entity128 competition this season , @entity3 have been reduced to paying outlandish sums and can ill - afford another season out of the @entity132			2
yet they are already playing catch - up on their rivals			0
the worry , if the defence can not be overhauled successfully at this late stage , is that they end up with what is available , rather than what they need			0
@entity7 has to get his business done , and quickly			0
if not , the consequences for the club , and their executive vice-chairman , are potentially status - changing			2

quiet : @entity3 have signed @entity147 ( left ) and @entity148 ( right ) this summer but no - one since june reinforcements : @entity150 ( left ) is another play who could strengthen @entity3 's squad			1

@entity1 must sign to help cover some deficiencies in @entity55 's squad
executive vice-chairman @entity7 also needs to make some big signings
if @entity3 fail this time then @entity15 will likely be the man to blame
@entity55 's track record suggests if he fails it wo *n't* be all his own fault
@entity7 failed in his role just as much as @entity43 did last season
@entity3 have failed to sign a player since june despite chasing targets
*key* figures @entity93 and @entity94 have not been replaced yet
