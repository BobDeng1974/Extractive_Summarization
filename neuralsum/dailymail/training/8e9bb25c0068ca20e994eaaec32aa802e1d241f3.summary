by @entity0 users of @entity3 's next handset may be able to track altitude , weather and even air pressure , according to code found in the @entity9 operating system			1
the files suggest a built - in barometer could provide instant weather readings by forecasting changes in the air pressure			1
the barometer could also be useful for mountain climbers , runners or bikers , who want to keep track of their altitude while training			2
users of @entity22 could have sensors to track altitude , weather and even air pressure , according to code hidden in the @entity9 operating system			1
this image is a screen grab from a video created by @entity30 site nowhereelse.fr			0
it features what is believed to be an industrial model of the @entity35 handset a barometer is a used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure			2
this can be used to forecast short - term changes in the weather			2
using barometric pressure and the change of pressure over time has been used in weather forecasting since the 19th century			2
in @entity3 's @entity22 , a barometer could be useful for mountain climbers , runners or bikers , who want to keep track of their altitude while training			1
the new sensors would also improve the accuracy and speed of the phone ’s location services			1
and as well as environmental readings , the new sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone ’s location services			1
this is because the data on altitude could allow the phone to reduce the number of calculations it needs to carry out to get a @entity67 lock			2
according to @entity69 , the references were discovered by @entity71 developer @entity70 , who found frameworks dedicated to ‘ altitude tracking ’ in the new code			1
@entity70 said he tried testing the framework with an @entity76 but it did n’t work , which suggests the new code was written for a yet - to - be - released @entity3 device			1
@entity70 added @entity3 could include a barometer in the next generation of @entity82 and the much - anticipated @entity83			2
pressure , barometer and humidity sensors have previously been included by @entity87 in both the @entity88 and @entity89			0
according to @entity69 , the references were discovered by @entity71 developer @entity70 , who found frameworks dedicated to ' altitude tracking ' in the new code last month , @entity93 phone firm @entity92 began telling customers @entity3 's @entity35 will launch on 19 september			1
the operator told call centre representatives to let customers know the date in a bid to stop them swapping operators , it has been claimed by @entity101			0
@entity3 's next handset is believed to have a 4.7 - inch screen - up from the 4 - inch screen of its current models - with a second version boasting a 5.5 - inch screen			1
@entity110 blog @entity109 claims this is the rear case of the @entity22 6			0
as well as environmental readings , the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone 's location services @entity3 's @entity35 is rumoured to come in a slim ' @entity118 ' version			1
up until august last year , @entity119 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity123 , at 6.18mm			0
this was then replaced by the @entity125 at just 5.75mm			0
by comparison , @entity3 ’s current @entity76 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity128 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			0
@entity87 's @entity88 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity129 is 9.3mm			0
according to @entity131 , however , the date could be little more than an informed guess			0
' the date is consistent with @entity3 's recent launches , making it likely an educated guess , ' it said			1
ceo @entity136 , while promising only ' new product categories ' for 2014 , has played his cards close to his chest			0
it is believed @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity143 's @entity142 have all been tapped to make the screens			0
representatives for the three suppliers and @entity3 declined to comment			0
both @entity22 6 screens will be larger than the 4.0 - inch panels on @entity3 's existing @entity76 and 5c models			1
larger iphones , the subject of months of speculation , would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like @entity87			0
the new design has moved the power switch to the side of the handset , and featured rounded edges , according to these leaked images @entity164 sources said the camera in the @entity22 will get a boost to @entity167 , from its current @entity169 version , along with a new lens offering better picture quality			1
it is also expected to boast a new filter , allowing for clearer pictures			0
if @entity3 follows its usual release schedule , the new models will be unveiled in september this year			2
@entity3 's new devices are expected to use the in - cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible			1
but reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused @entity3 to delay production of the 5.5 - inch versions			2
the images , pictured left and right , were posted on @entity191 social network @entity190 earlier this month and are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at @entity3 supplier @entity193			0
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera , similar to that seen on the @entity198			0

sensors may provide weather data by looking at air pressure changes
the sensor would also improve accuracy of @entity3 's location services
they could prove useful for climbers , runners or bikers during training
the code for ' altitude tracking ' was found by developer @entity70
handset is believed to come in 4.7in screen and 5.5in screen versions
sources say camera in the @entity35 will get a boost to 10 *megapixels*
in - cell touch technology may embed sensors tightly into the screen
@entity231 - company is yet to *announce* a release date for @entity22
