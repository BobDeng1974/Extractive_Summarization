i 'm a bit of a daredevil and i 'll do almost anything			2
but just moments after i agreed to attend the launch of @entity7 's @entity6 , in a very unlike - me fashion , my stomach sank			1
i do n't like watching horror films , and i 'm quite reluctant to get on a rollercoaster			1
what was she thinking ? @entity20 at the launch of @entity23 's @entity22 to celebrate 13 years , horror author @entity24 has collaborated to curate 13 new characters the launch got off to a good - albeit chilly - start on wednesday night , with stars from @entity28 and made in @entity29 attending , as well as supermodel - of - the - moment @entity20 - and the @entity7 team looked after us with free cheeseburgers , @entity34 and an open bar			1
the theme park in @entity37 has gone all - out for @entity38 - including a new experienced called @entity39			1
it 's an overnight challenge that involves being locked up in the park , then gagged and blindfolded			1
thrill - seekers are then chased by a sacrificial cannibal cult who feast upon human flesh , and taken on a horrifying backstage tour of the @entity47 and horror mazes			1
it sounds awful ! and i was already having second , third and forth thoughts about just attending the launch night			1
i had roped in a friend - there was no way i was doing this alone			1
as the night unfolded , there were terrifying actors in horror costume around every corner to scare the wits out of us - something revellers will also be able to enjoy during the park 's @entity22 fest until november 2			1
@entity68 horror author @entity24 has curated 13 new scare characters for this year 's event , to celebrate 13 years of @entity6			1
after filling up on some fast food ( probably not the best decision ) i decided to brave @entity73 alive : the maze , designed by the same twisted people who created the saw rollercoaster			2
you go in in groups and by common assumption the person at the front usually gets the biggest scare as they see everything first and , well , they are basically a human shield for everyone else			1
my companion and i proceeded to queue up behind barbed wire to go inside			2
when we reached the front we were set to be first in , so we let a group go in front of us			2
unlucky for us , there were seven of them , and only seven to eight go in at a time - so were at the front again			1
we were finally allowed to join on the back of another group , but they were all screaming teenage girls that begged us to go in front			0
this was quite embarrassing ; a twenty - something woman and man wimping out and making a couple of terrified girls lead the way			1
however , there was no way i was going first ! after filling up on some fast food i braved @entity112 : the maze , located right next to the rollercoaster saw alive : the maze : @entity16 had to queue up behind barbed wire , then was scared out of her wits inside an intense briefing began - heart problems ? no entry			2
scare easily ? best not go in ! we had a photo - op with a model of the bike - riding @entity127 puppet , before entering the themed multi-room maze inspired by his nightmarish games			1
the ' extreme live action ' attraction is like a walking ghost train , but with real people acting out horror characters instead of mannequins			1
the first person we met on our journey was a security guy in his office : red flashing lights , screens showing @entity142 footage , loud sirens			0
he told us it was chaos in there and we must absolutely not go in or we might not make it			0
obviously , we had to			0
that famous scene with the large bathroom was the first room we entered			0
it was bloodied and gruesome ; two actors were acting out a panicked scene			0
in another room , a woman was chained to a wooden structure , and it seemed like she had been that way for a long time			0
she was tapping the chain on the side of it ; a long , depressed look on her face , like a lab monkey			0
then suddenly she went mental , and in a fit of rage started smashing the heavy steel all over the room and everyone screamed and ran			0
it was intense and highly disturbing , but once we made it out alive , it did feel like fun and games			2
costumed characters make sure you 're not sitting comfortably ! before you go in here , and in fact before every attraction , you get a thorough briefing behind each door was a nightmarish being , including people hanging from walls and doors and ceilings new this year is @entity7 's own made up horror movie studio maze , called @entity187 , full of similar jump - out - of - your - skin scare tactics			1
we tried this one out next , strobe lights and smoke obscuring our vision as we entered the room			0
a tall woman with a slick blonde up - do and dressed in a pencil dress lined us up and told us we were auditioning to act in a horror film			1
her spiky face spread into a smile , she started eyeing us all up before stopping at me with her head tilted slightly and slowly walked towards me			0
i panicked and hid behind my laughing friend			0
the woman was now very close my heart was pounding ; then she sharply looked at the person beside me			0
she then released us and we were set to explore the studio , where our uncomfortable journey saw us climb through makeshift tunnels into bloodied make up booths , deserted motel themed sets and rooms filled with hanging body bags			0
after studio 13 i felt it was time for a rollercoaster , so went on my favourite , @entity219			2
it was so not scary compared to the mazes , and actually super fun			1
that hyped me up for the next attraction			0
@entity225 : the maze is scariest : there is a horrible clown ! next on our list was @entity225 : the @entity226 , which actually won @entity232 at the @entity233 2014			0
it was certainly the scariest attraction of the night for me			2
there was a frightening clown character who picked on me			0
i screamed and screamed but the clown continued			0
they even removed their wing and chased me down the corridor ! my friend found it hilarious			0
we entered a rustic cabin scene ; just one room with lots of doors and no obvious route - we just had to guess the way , which was quite scary in itself			1
behind each door was a nightmarish being , including individuals who looked like they were wearing latex masks or dressed in ghoulish attire - such as nightgowns with wigs but all stained and torn up like they 'd been in a fight with a zombie they would pop out from nowhere in a jerky , deranged fashion , getting close to our faces			1
some were hanging from doors and ceilings , cornering us and scratching and nipping at our calves , making us jump			0
some touched the back of my neck in a soft , creepy way , quickly tugging on my hair when i least expected it which made me jump ! i had not screamed that much in ages			0
the 22 - year - old model , dressed in aubergine sweatpants and a camouflage jacket , clutching her blue wig there 's something very eerie about riding rollercoasters on a foggy , slightly damp and chilly night as well as spooky horror attractions , five of @entity7 's world - class rollercoasters stay open into the night , including the swarm , @entity289 ( very fast , very tall ) , @entity219 ( feet - free and my favourite ) , @entity291 ( ten - loop tumble ) and @entity293 ( with that daunting inverted drop )			1
they 're all included in the entry price			0
all the other actor - led horror attractions - mostly mazes - are also based on cult classic horror films			1
they include the @entity301 and @entity302			0
as we had only half an hour left in the park , we went on the swarm which was scary but not stomach - churning			1
it was great and i wish i had time to go on again			0
if you 're a bit of a scaredy cat like me , the thing to remember and learn from my experience is - you will be fine ! and , being brave is good for you - nothing is as bad as you think			2
and those who like to be scared will love it ! and i think it will actually scare you quite a lot , maybe more than you expect			2
the acting is truly brilliant , and there 's something very eerie about riding rollercoasters on a foggy , slightly damp and chilly night			1
it 's quite surreal and starkly different to my memories of theme parks in the summer sunshine			0
in fact it 's so scary that the theme park has opened a @entity327 to calm guests down			2
the safe warren is filled with 25 bunnies , classical music and lavender trees and makes for a stark contrast to the grotesque ghouls that roam the grounds during @entity6			2
@entity336 : @entity337 may be too intense for young children and is not recommended for anyone under the age of 13			2
experiences are subject to availability			0
