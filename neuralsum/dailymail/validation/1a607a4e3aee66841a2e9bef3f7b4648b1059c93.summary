architects in @entity1 have planned a skyscraper for the city of @entity4 shaped called @entity5			2
the city , which sits in @entity7 and sees a large number of the tower 's namesake weather events , has been looking for a building to rejuvenate an area that currently holds a part - time garage			1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , an architecture firm based in @entity4 , was approached by a local magazine to come up with an idea , and has now unveiled the concept for the @entity5 , which would hold a severe weather museum and research center			1
plans for the funnel cloud - shaped tower currently range from 20 to 30 stories , and would multiple floors would feature outdoor terraces			2
mr @entity14 said that the garden floors were designed to look like tree debris being carried away by the twister			1
the building 's similarities to its real - life counterpart also include led lights on the outside that would be spaced to give drivers on a nearby highway the illusion that the structure was spinning			1
a restaurant on the top floor would also spin counter-clockwise , the direction of tornadoes			2
mr @entity14 said that they have been contacted by multiple potential investors interested in finding out more details about the project			2
the firm says that the reaction has been largely positive and that two @entity56 have already voiced support			0
the funnel cloud building would hold a weather museum , multiples gardens , a revolving restaurant and a research center while the design of the building may make it look likely to be blown over in the famously strong @entity1 winds , its creators say the structure would be stable			1
a solid core would go up the middle of the building with elevators and bathrooms , according to @entity75			0
the building would also feature a 360 - degree rotating restaurant on its top floor , and the revolving action seems appropriate given the tower 's swirling inspiration			0
architects say office space could be easily added and classrooms in its base could help teach visitors about weather safety			1
' if you think of @entity89 , you think of the arch. in @entity91 , you think of the @entity92			0
@entity4 's one of those places where nobody thinks of anything but @entity96 and dust			0
and well , maybe tornadoes , ' @entity14 said			2
@entity5 , which does not yet have a client to build it , would be held up by a strong core section with elevators			0
it would be located near the @entity101 ( left ) , a 19,000 - seat arena @entity5 would be visible from most of the downtown @entity4 area , and the architect said his team was looking to make ' an elegant looking building '			1
the state of @entity1 saw more than 80 tornadoes in 2013 , though the number did not reach the 145 - tornado record set in 1999 , according to the @entity111			0
on top of the tower there would be a terrace designed for reporters to do weather broadcasts			0
@entity4 's skyline features a number of skyscrapers that would remain taller than the proposed @entity5 , including the 52 - story @entity121 that was designed by the same architects who built the original @entity124			0
the new tower would be located near @entity101 , the 19,000 - seat home of the @entity126			0
@entity14 said that discussions have also been had about moving the prospective building to a different area with more ground space			1
the weather museum and research center would add another skyscraper to the @entity4 skyline if it is built near the @entity101 ( right )			1

@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity136 came up with idea to rejuvenate downtown space
building would include a weather research center and classrooms
@entity145 terraces would look like debris and led lights make it appear to spin
architects do *n't* have a client yet , but drawings have generated interest
