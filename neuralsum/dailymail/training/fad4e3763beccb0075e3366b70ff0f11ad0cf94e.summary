' he will present his last show in june and continue to host quiz show @entity57			0
director - general @entity58 said : ' this is a particularly poignant moment for me , because i have known @entity1 and relished working with him , since the day i joined the @entity9 in 1973			1
and i am therefore better placed than most to know what a remarkable job he has done at @entity3			0
' his is a rare and dazzling talent			0
he has a unique ability to create moments of real discomfort for politicians and memorable delight for audiences			0
for that cussed brilliance and much more besides , the @entity9 and our audiences will always be in his debt			1
' the @entity9 's director of news , @entity76 , said @entity1 was the ' great lion of @entity9 journalism '			1
he said : ' we accept his decision to move on but i think it is fair to say that the only people really celebrating his decision will be the politicians and public figures he has so often and so brilliantly held to account			1
' the show 's new editor , @entity88 , said it had been ' a huge privilege ' to work with @entity1 and said he was ' deeply grateful ' to him for agreeing to stay on			1

@entity1 is also a long - time presenter of the @entity9 's @entity57 programme @entity3 presenter @entity1 with comedian @entity104 early days : a young @entity1 pictured on the set of @entity3 in 1986 the moment when the prime minister @entity107 heard from @entity108 , who is out of shot , that he has given a wrong answer to a question from interviewer @entity1 television presenter @entity1 talking to @entity9 controller @entity112 at the @entity115 party before he was famous : a young @entity1 in 1974 bookmaker @entity116 has released the latest odds on who will take over : 7/4 @entity132 / 1 @entity131 / 1 @entity130 / 1 @entity129 / 1 @entity128 / 1 @entity127 / 1 @entity126 / 1 @entity125 / 1 @entity124 / 1 @entity123 / 1 @entity122 / 1 @entity121 / 1 @entity120 / 1 @entity119 in a terse email fired off by @entity35 controller @entity135 , the 63 - year - old was also asked to keep his outspoken views under control			1
the row came after @entity1 launched an astonishing attack on the @entity9 this week , calling his employer ' smug ' , criticising the payoff scandal and claiming it ' distorts the marketplace ' with its news operation			1
he said : ' there 's a pile of stuff on the @entity9 i ca n't stand			1
my idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [ @entity154 ] in a lift which has @entity156 plumbed into it			0
i do n't quite understand why the @entity9 does @entity156			2
' i do n't really understand why it does @entity35			2
clearly , you can meet those needs commercially			0
' however , mr @entity135 defended his stations and said the @entity9 's commercial rivals are unable to provide a comparable service			1
a close shave : @entity1 's beard was the subject of much speculation last year			1
he later ditched it he said : ' commercial radio targeted at young listeners does not win awards for documentaries about domestic abuse in teenage relationships , it does not have two 15 - minute news programmes in its daytime output listened to by more young people than watch the 10 o'clock news , and it does not play 65 hours of specialist music a week			0
' he added : ' if the licence fee is collected from everyone , then the @entity9 should represent the whole of society , not just certain parts of it			2
' in january , @entity1 admitted that @entity3 viewers would sometimes do better to turn off the television and go to bed rather than watch the programme			2
the anchor revealed that on some nights he wanted to say , ' not much happened today ' - but added that he would feel guilty about betraying his colleagues if he did so			0

he said : ' you chose to be a journalist			0
why do n't you get yourself a proper job ? instead of sitting around telling politicians what to do the whole time			0
a highlight of the @entity9 's 2005 general election coverage was @entity1 's bat - tempered tussle with @entity230			1
@entity1 's encounter with mr @entity230 in the early hours of friday may 6 , following the latter 's shock victory over @entity235 's @entity234 in @entity236 and @entity237 , became one of the main talking points of the night after the victorious @entity241 candidate ripped off his microphone and stormed out of the interview			1
