a boy aged three died after a catalogue of failures by the @entity3 and in particular its out - of - hours services , a damning report is expected to reveal this week			1
@entity6 died 36 hours after his parents first sought medical help for suspected flu and a chest infection			1
in that crucial period , they say they experienced a series of shocking blunders from doctors , @entity16 , an out - of - hours gp service and a hospital			2
@entity6 died following a catalogue of errors by his local @entity3 providers in @entity22 in december 2010 the mistakes were compounded when the grieving couple asked the @entity3 to investigate the events leading to @entity6 ’s death from septic shock to prevent future tragedies			1
two initial investigations failed to identify key problems , and @entity31 and @entity32 said they were forced to relive ‘ the life - shattering death ’ of their child to get officials to finally act			1
mr @entity6 , 41 , said : ‘ @entity6 was full of life			1
he was a force of nature , with an infectious sense of fun … if nobody listens and if the system is not changed then children like @entity6 will keep dying			1
’ @entity6 fell ill with suspected flu on december 21 , 2010 , and his mother took him to his local gp who said there was no sign of a chest infection			1
the toddler ’s condition deteriorated overnight and his mother called the surgery the next morning to say he was worse and ‘ constantly thirsty ’			0
she was asked if he had been passing urine and said he was too ill to get up and use the lavatory so she had kept him in a nappy			0
but the @entity46 failed to ask if there was urine in the nappy			0
it was dry , a signal that @entity6 ’s kidneys had begun to fail			1
@entity6 was finally taken to @entity64 , which is run by @entity65 , where he died in december 2010 that evening after he vomited clear liquid containing thin strands which appeared to be blood his parents called @entity16 , but their call was categorised as routine , not an emergency , and information was recorded wrongly			1
@entity6 then vomited a black liquid and mrs @entity32 , 38 , contacted an out - of - hours gp service , @entity76 , who told her to take @entity6 to a local treatment centre in @entity79			1
a young mother died from cancer after doctors told her to cure a lump on her breast with primrose oil ointment			2
@entity86 , from @entity87 , went back several times to say the treatment was not working			2
two years later , doctors sent a biopsy for analysis and advanced cancer was diagnosed			0
scans found multiple tumours on her brain			0
her devastated husband @entity98 is now bringing up their sons @entity100 , 13 , and @entity101 , 11 , on his own			2
mrs @entity86 first visited her gp in 2006 when she was 27 and was referred to @entity103 where doctors diagnosed a skin condition similar to eczema and advised her to treat it with primrose oil ointment			0
it was n’t until november 2008 that a biopsy was sent to be examined			0
she died in 2012 , aged 33			2
@entity103 has now agreed to pay the family damages			0
mrs @entity32 questioned the advice but was wrongly assured the treatment centre was her best option			1
the family learned later the advice was based on a conversation between the unqualified call handler and a driver			0
at the treatment centre , the family were placed in a queue until mrs @entity32 flagged down a passing nurse who immediately raised the alarm			1
the little boy was taken by ambulance to @entity64 and prescribed antibiotics , but did not receive the drugs for three hours			1
by that time an invasive bacterial infection had entered his weakened system and he died from septic shock hours later on december 23			1
the case highlighted concerns about the safety of out - of - hours care , including @entity16 , which has since been replaced			0
but the family said their distress had been compounded by bureaucracy and failings in the complaints procedure			0
according to the @entity143 , which has supported mr and mrs @entity32 , two investigations commissioned by @entity3 ‘ failed to find answers and hold those involved to account ’			1
in march 2012 the couple complained to the @entity147 ( @entity147 ) , the highest authority on @entity3 complaints			2
but they said officials failed to understand information about the case			0
the couple said they persevered in a bid to improve the health service for other patients , including their other sons , now aged nine and two			0
the @entity143 said @entity6 ’s death exposed ‘ catastrophic and systemic ’ failings in care and in how the @entity3 handles complaints			1
chief executive @entity163 said : ' having worked with the @entity6 family over the last three years , our experience of the @entity147 has been painful			1
' the family wanted organisations to learn so that this would not happen again , but the ombudsman did not want to interview anyone about what went wrong			0
' the @entity147 is the body which is supposed to hold the @entity3 to account and set benchmarks but there seems to be a lack of accountability for its own actions			2
' the @entity143 helpline has advised hundreds of people to contact the ombudsman but time and time again people have come back to us saying the @entity147 has told them there ’s nothing more they can do			0
' at this point in time i would not advise anyone who came to our helpline to contact the @entity147 , because i have no confidence in it			0
a senior executive within the @entity147 told mr @entity6 and i the methodology used in their investigation into our complaints was not fit for purpose			2
' it ’s time that this organisation was subjected to greater scrutiny			0
it costs billions at a time when the @entity3 is struggling			2
if that money was invested in frontline staff we would have a very different @entity3			2
' the @entity147 is due to publish its report into @entity6 ’s death this week and is expected to uphold @entity6 and mrs @entity32 ’s concerns about his treatment			1
a @entity147 spokesman said : ‘ we recognise that we took too long to investigate this case			0
’ devon doctors said it was committed to ensuring such an occurrence can not happen again .			0
