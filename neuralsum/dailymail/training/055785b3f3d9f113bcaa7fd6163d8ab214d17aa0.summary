@entity2 's leading human rights group said it had not been informed of any prisoner release since thursday , when the total count stood at 41			1
the @entity2 @entity17 and @entity18 has been keeping close track of the liberation of prisoners since they began last week , reporting releases within hours after hearing from family members or prisoners themselves			2

@entity30 , head of the group , told @entity31 that his count was the same as the rights commission 's and he knew of no release since thursday			1
@entity37 , left , and @entity38 , were two of the dissidents released the releases have been shrouded in confusion due to both a @entity7 and @entity2 reluctance to release the names of those on the list			1
the prisoners had been on a list of opposition figures whose release was sought as part of the @entity7 agreement last month with the @entity2 government			1
they had been cited by various human rights organizations as being imprisoned by the @entity2 government for exercising internationally protected freedoms or for their promotion of political and social reforms in @entity2			1
speaking in @entity59 , @entity60 , president @entity1 's @entity58 ambassador said the prisoners were released in recent days			1
' welcome as that step is , and heartening as it is for their families , ( it ) does not resolve the larger human rights problems on the island , ' @entity62 said , according to prepared remarks			1
earlier , an official traveling with @entity7 secretary of state @entity71 in @entity72 said the @entity7 verified the release			0
@entity62 was speaking monday at an event hosted by senate majority leader @entity75 , @entity76			0
she outlined issues which the administration and the @entity80 - led @entity79 could work together on and issues they remained further apart on			0
both sides want to advance freedom in @entity2 , she said , but they disagree on strategy			0
' some of the embargo 's staunchest defenders are @entity87 and @entity80 with deep ties to the island â€” people whose families came to @entity7 fleeing the @entity93 ' repression , ' @entity62 explained			0
' these are men and women who are completely dedicated to doing all they can to ensure that @entity2 on the island get to enjoy true freedom			0
so it is important to acknowledge that while there may be disagreements on the best way to get there , we share a common goal of advancing the rights of the @entity2 people			2
' @entity62 said changes already are occurring in @entity2			0
when @entity2 artist @entity109 and other activists were detained after announcing an anti-government event in @entity113 's historic @entity112 , she said , nearly 300 @entity2 artists signed a letter supporting her freedom			2

the @entity7 released several @entity2 intelligence agents			2

we do n't know who they are , ' sen. @entity149 , @entity150 , said in an appearance monday on ' @entity155			0
' @entity149 said he supports improving ties with @entity2 but said he 's worried that the @entity2 are getting virtually everything they want from the @entity7 for ' these minimal changes			2
' he said he wants to be certain that improved relations between @entity160 and @entity113 provides equal benefits to the @entity7 ' my interest in @entity2 is freedom and democracy , ' he said			0
@entity149 , a member of the @entity166 who 's considering a run for the presidency , said there is ' no current example ' around the world where a " government of resistant tyranny " has moved to greater freedom and democracy as a result of changes in international relations that are based on economic incentives .			0
