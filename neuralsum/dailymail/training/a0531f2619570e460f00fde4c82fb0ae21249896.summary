by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 10:30 est , 22 october 2013 naming a child can be hard enough with so many old and new names going in and out of fashion			2
now a new tool shows how trends in girls ' names have swept across the @entity8 over the decades			1
this fascinating map illustrates how some names will stand the test of time , while others are short - lived trends - here today but gone tomorrow			1
trendy : new mothers and fathers can check out which girls ' names are the most popular in their state and across the @entity8 with this time - lapse map the clever tool shows how some names , such as @entity23 and @entity24 have stood the test of time and swept across the entire country in popularity remarkably , it also illustrates how some parts of the @entity8 are the trend - setters , coming up with a new favourite girls ' name , which then spread like wildfire across neighbouring states , and sometimes even across the entire @entity8			1
from 1960 until 2012 , the most popular girls name in each state are easily identified by the colour , while all other names are monochrome			2
@entity40 and @entity41 , in the mid-east , frequently buck the trend			2
these two states opted for @entity44 over @entity24 in the mid- 1970s , ending a decade dedicated to a love for the name @entity24			2
not all names were adopted from @entity48 , with trends often spanning a cluster of neighbouring states @entity51 , like @entity24 a few years earlier , showed it was a strong girls ' name that stood the test of time , clinging on for years in some states , disappearing but then coming back again they then also adopt @entity58 , which spread almost entirely across the @entity8 in the late 1980s and early 1990s			1
perhaps one of the traditionalist states is @entity62 , which began the @entity24 affair in 1969			0
it went on to be the most popular girls ' baby name throughout the 1970s and early 1980s			0
the name @entity68 originates in the @entity69 , in @entity62 , in 1996			1
it 's picked up two years later in neighbouring states before it travels like a plague across the south - east and other pockets for a few years			1
@entity68 's eventually pushed out in favour of @entity76 and @entity77			0
@entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are some of the most popular recent baby names today the @entity8			0
sometimes , names were only popular for a short period of time in just one or two states , like @entity85 on the @entity86 the baby names map was created by @entity88 , of @entity90 sports news service , using data from the @entity92			1
after some trial and errors with colours mr @entity93 decided it was ' cleaner and more interesting to limit the palette to just the most popular name for any given year , and put the rest in greyscale so you coud se how the different eras of tops names progressed , ' he is quoted in the @entity106			0
the baby naming trend data was made available by one curious father in 1997 who did n't want to name his child a common name			0
according to the @entity112 , @entity111 wrote a simple programme to sort rank popular baby names , as listed on @entity92 data , against year and gender			0
his program gave the results of the most popular boys ' and girls ' names			0
both the north west and south east regions appear to be trend - setters , often the first states to break away from a traditional name and start a new trend , such as @entity128 @entity78 , @entity79 , traditional name @entity76 and @entity80 are some of the most popular baby names for girls today			1

some names have stood the test of time while others are a brief - lived trend
@entity139 shows that @entity69 and @entity140 are often trend - setting states
