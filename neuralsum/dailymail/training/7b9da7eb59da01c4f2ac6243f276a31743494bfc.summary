by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:04 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:50 est , 30 december 2013 the @entity4 is running out of money and will be unable to meet the needs of the soaring population , the elderly and the obese , a top doctor has warned			1
dr @entity9 , the chairman of the @entity11 's council , said the financial outlook was dire and the health service was ' struggling just to keep pace ' with rising demand			1
he said the situation is so bleak that if the @entity4 was a country , it would ' barely have a credit rating ' , putting it on a par with @entity20 and @entity21			1
dr @entity9 has said @entity4 finances are in ' dire ' shape , with the service struggling ' just to keep pace ' in a stark warning , dr @entity9 said the health service will have to make ' fundamental changes ' which could lead to routine treatments and procedures being cut			1
and he said that within the next ten years , if funding only keeps pace with inflation , the @entity4 could have annual debts of up to £ 54billion as patient demand far outstrips the money it gets from the @entity38			1
the health service has an annual budget of £ 106billion and unlike other government departments it has been ring - fenced from public service cuts over the past three years			0
but there is mounting concern among doctors and healthcare leaders that even if this level of income is guaranteed , the service will not be able to meet the soaring demand			0
this is because of the rising population , increased numbers of elderly , the effects of obesity and alcohol and the cost of expensive new medicines			1
in a message to the @entity11 , the doctors ' union , dr @entity9 said : ' the financial outlook is dire			1
the @entity4 is struggling just to keep pace			2
he blamed the rising cost of treatment , the ageing population , and obesity for rising costs ' a growing and ageing population , public health problems like obesity , and constant advances in treatment and technology are all contributing to push @entity4 costs well above general inflation			1
the numbers overall are so bad that if the @entity4 was a country , it would barely have a credit rating at all			2
' he said that @entity4 staff had ' borne the brunt ' of the government 's efficiency drive – the health service has been asked to find £ 20billion in efficiency savings by 2015			2
' the @entity86 said the @entity4 had made the “ easiest ” savings first , ' he said			1
' they were certainly not easy for the doctors and other healthcare staff who were made to bear the brunt			2
and it is not easy for the patients and staff every time a vacancy is not filled , a ward is closed , or a clinic is cancelled			0
' earlier this month , another senior healthcare leader suggested routine treatments would have to be cut			0
@entity99 , head of the @entity100 , the hospital watchdog , said there were a ' number of organisations facing really significant financial pressures '			0
at a meeting at the @entity107 think - tank in @entity108 , he said there were at least 30 hospital trusts facing serious problems			0
mr @entity99 said : ' we 've simply had too much uncertainty in the first half of the financial year			0
' he warned of a ' build - up of more patients nobody can afford to pay for ' and said the @entity4 would have to ' take out capacity ' or cut services			2
it is not clear which treatments or procedures currently available on the @entity4 would be slashed , but some areas are already rationing hip and knee replacements and cataract treatment			1
leading figures have suggested charging patients for services which are currently free , such as @entity132 home visits and even hospital stays			0
he also criticsed @entity135 for suggesting that @entity137 contracts had lead to increased waiting times at @entity139 , calling the remarks ' attacks on our professionalism ' earlier this year the @entity144 , which represents healthcare managers , said patients could be made to pay £ 8.50 every time they call out a doctor			2
and a poll by @entity150 in july found that half of @entity137 were in favour of charging patients for appointments , with fees ranging from £ 5 to £ 25			0
a spokesman for the @entity157 said : ' we know the @entity4 needs to change to meet the needs of an ageing population and increasing demand on services			1
' dr @entity9 acknowledges that it is possible to achieve efficiencies and still improve care , and that is exactly what the @entity4 must continue to do			1
' we have protected the overall health budget and we also recently announced plans to invest £ 3.8billion to improve the way health and social care services join up			0
' this amounts to a major shift of resources to prevention of ill health			0
we are also bringing back named gps for vulnerable elderly patients so that they get the care they need and prevent unnecessary trips to hospital and @entity139			0

dr @entity9 made the remarks in his @entity187 message
@entity4 finances were in ' dire ' shape , with a growing funding *gap*
ageing population , obesity and costly treatments all cause rising costs
