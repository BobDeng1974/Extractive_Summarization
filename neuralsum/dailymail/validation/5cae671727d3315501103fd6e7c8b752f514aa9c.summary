organic kitty litter was partially to blame for a multimillion - dollar radiation leak at an underground nuclear waste dump in @entity4 , scientists revealed this week			2
the @entity6 report on last year 's accident at the @entity8 near @entity9 showed that a drum of waste containing radioisotopes like plutonium was improperly packaged at the @entity14 near @entity15 before arriving for disposal			2
the improper mix in the barrel , including the wrong sort of kitty litter used to absorb liquids , sparked a chemical reaction causing it to heat up and generate gases that dislodged its lid , spewing radioactive materials , investigators found			0
this barrel at the @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity4 , ruptured a year ago , resulting in radioactive contamination that shut down @entity8 indefinitely culprit : the waste drum contained ' chemically incompatible ' materials , including @entity33 brand of organic kitty litter health scare : the accident at @entity8 exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not expected to threaten their health the radiation leak that began in the @entity8 disposal chamber half a mile below ground february 14 , 2014 , ' did not result from a detonation , ' the 277 - page report released thursday concluded			1
the accident exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not expected to threaten their health , according to @entity47 , the contractor that operates the facility			1
the accident indefinitely suspended key operations at the site , the @entity6 's only permanent underground repository for certain types of radiological waste tied to @entity56 nuclear labs and weapons sites			0
in september , @entity6 officials estimated the cost of the initial recovery of the dump at $ 240million and said it might be two years or more before it is fully operational again			0
' i can not say how high a priority it is to get @entity8 reopened and operating			0
in general terms , it is critical for everything we do in geologic disposal of nuclear materials , ' energy secretary @entity66 said at a @entity74 hearing earlier this week			0
the report confirms the agency 's preliminary theories about the cause of the costly mishap and also clarified that just one barrel of waste containing ' chemically incompatible ' materials - including @entity33 brand litter , nitrate salts and a neutralizing agent - from @entity14 was to blame			1
a worker drives a cart through a tunnel inside the @entity8 no. 2 , 150 feet below the surface near @entity9 , @entity4 the improper mix of chemicals sparked a reaction causing it to heat up and generate gases that dislodged its lid , spewing radioactive materials the drum of waste that caused the leak came from the @entity14 ( pictured ) @entity4 slapped the @entity6 with $ 54million in fines in december for violations of state hazardous waste permits tied to @entity8 and the @entity14 lab. also last year , a team of federal inspectors released a report that cited chronic lapses in safety procedures at @entity14 that contributed to the radiation leak			1
the lab 's ' waste processing and safety - related control procedures should have prevented the addition of these potentially incompatible materials , ' the inspectors said of the ruptured waste barrel .			2
