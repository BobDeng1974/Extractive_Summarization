an adventurous photographer , @entity0 , could n't resist scaling a 50 - foot deep ice crevasse - simply because it lay within the city limits of his hometown			2
with an ice axe in hand , the 33 - year - old local resident drove , kayaked and trekked the 10 miles from his home in @entity10 's capital , @entity11 , to the @entity12 , so that he could enjoy the simple thrill of exploring one of nature 's most spectacular phenomena			1
' the images show a massive moulin , which is a glacial feature that is the result of flowing water carving its way down through weaker points in the ice , ' @entity0 said			1
adventurous photographer , @entity0 , scaled the 50 - foot crevasse on the @entity12 to experience its frozen beauty the glacier is only 10 miles from his home - in @entity11 , @entity10 - and @entity0 has long been exploring the icy natural wonders '' we visited the @entity12 because it is unbearably easy to access its incredible features , like the one in the photos , only a couple of hours from our homes			1
' there are times , especially when the sun is in the sky , that you just ca n't justify not going exploring on the ice ... and this was one of those times			0
' sometimes the openings point straight down to the bedrock under the glacier , and other times , they turn and run horizontally for awhile			0
' that was the case for this particular feature - it contained a passage that curved around a couple bends and was quite long			0
' with an ice axe in hand , guide @entity53 explored the moulin , a feature resulting from water carving its way down through weaker points @entity0 especially enjoys exploring the glaciers when the sun is high in the sky and seeing the stunning reflections off of the ice to assist him with his trek , @entity0 enlisted the help of @entity53 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) , who are experienced glacier guides home to just 32,000 residents , @entity11 was founded in 1881 by @entity75 miners who came to the land after @entity10 was purchased from @entity77 in 1867			1
now , it 's a modern city that must contend with nature , like in 2008 , when an avalanche damaged the local power supply leaving the city without mains power or when last year 's earthquake disrupted telecommunications			0
the city of @entity11 is adjacent to the @entity87 , so it is surrounded by a glacial landscape that includes islands , fjords , u-shaped valleys , sculpted mountains , and of course the glaciers themselves			2
while sometimes glacier openings point straight down to the bedrock underneath , other times , they turn and run horizontally ( pictured here ) @entity0 admits that it 's difficult to describe just how much he loves the @entity12 , as it 's been part of his life since he was 10 years old @entity0 visited the most accessible local glacier with experienced local guides @entity53 and @entity69			1
' @entity53 and @entity106 are both glacier guides with extensive training and experience on the @entity12 , ' @entity0 explained			1
' but there 's always a degree of danger inherent in glacier travel and climbing in general			0
' it 's difficult to describe how much i love the @entity12			2
' views of the glacier have been a part of my daily life since i was ten years old , and i 've been enjoying its beauty up close for more than a decade			0
' it is constantly changing as it retreats further and further up its valley , but it consistently takes my breath away			0

@entity0 , 33 , from @entity11 , @entity10 , has long been a *fan* of the nearby @entity12
along with two glacier guides , @entity53 and @entity69 , @entity0 set out to photograph the natural wonder
with ice axes in hand , the trio explored moulins , glacial features that result from water running over weaker points
