it is an @entity1 landscape of quintessential beauty , whose many shades of green contrast sharply with the red , loamy soil : a place of steep , broad hills and ancient stone churches , where magnificent open vistas stretch from the crags of @entity12 to the sea at @entity14			0
@entity15 has inspired many writers , such as @entity17 , @entity18 and sir @entity19			1
but today , one of its jewels , @entity25 , in the heart of an officially designated @entity21 close to the @entity12 , is being desecrated			1
thanks to a company controlled by @entity27 , the former underwear model who is the son - in - law of the @entity28 , running along the road at the top of the @entity25 for close to a mile is the edge of a giant 50 - acre solar panel energy farm			1
they have now sold their interest to sister company @entity51			0
@entity52 and @entity53 share the same investor , @entity54 , while ‘ green ’ financier @entity55 is a director of all three firms			1
without the huge subsidies added to consumers ’ bills , the solar panel business would not be profitable			1
ms @entity61 refuses to divulge how much @entity53 – in which mr @entity27 owns 115,000 shares - has been paid , saying this information is ‘ commercially sensitive ’			1
an internal report by the local @entity68 ’s heritage and landscape officer , @entity70 , described the solar panel development as ‘ not sympathetic to the character of the locality ’ , warning that it would ‘ detract from its scenic quality ’			1
however , it was awarded planning permission late last year without ever being discussed by the council ’s planning committee			0
on its website , @entity80 ’s firm , @entity79 , claims the farm ‘ sits within its own bowl , largely hidden from the surrounding landscape ’			1
in fact , seen from the air , it dominates it : a y - shaped hilltop sprawl with line after line of black , reflective panels on metal frames			0
as @entity95 ’s report makes clear , the farm is visible from @entity96 , a popular hiking and picnic spot ten miles away on @entity12			1
the ranks of panels loom over @entity100 , a gorgeous village with water meadows and a grade i listed @entity106 church			0
the ranks of panels loom over @entity100 , a gorgeous village with water meadows and a grade i listed @entity106 church the @entity100 estate ’s owner , @entity110 , refused to say yesterday how much he was being paid for the use of his land			2
his only comment was to complain that we had flown over the solar farm without seeking his permission			2
the @entity53 website makes much of a pledge , issued by @entity41 , to pay £ 6,500 a year for a ‘ community benefit fund ’ for projects such as improved local internet connections			1
yet , next to the vast amounts the farm will rake in , most of it from subsidy , this pales into insignificance			0
the @entity127 asked @entity128 , director of the @entity129 , a specialist think - tank , to compute the sums , given the panels ’ supposed output of 6.5 megawatts			1
he said : ‘ the total annual income will be about £ 770,000 , of which about £ 430,000 a year will be from subsidy under the @entity138 scheme , ie over 50 per cent of their annual income will be from subsidy			1
’ this is about 60 times as much as might be expected as income from growing wheat			2
when @entity127 asked about the figures , mr @entity27 and @entity41 issued a statement			2
this referred only to the legality of the farm ’s planning permission , adding that the site would eventually be surrounded by newly planted hedges			1
‘ once [ these ] have had a chance to grow in , no one will be able to see it , ’ the statement said			2
‘ not only is the solar park helping to cut carbon emissions and increase our energy security , it will result in a huge improvement in ecology and biodiversity , with the creation of habitats for nightjars and skylarks being just one example of measures that have been built into the design			2
’ in @entity95 ’s view , while planting hedges might reduce the impact , the site ’s exposed and windy location meant the hedges were ‘ unlikely to survive ’			1
in the money : @entity181 ( right ) at the races with his sister @entity183 ( left ) and her mother the @entity28 moreover , this large industrial project was completely at odds with the landscape , and ‘ the panels will stand out from the surrounding green fields and be a focal point in views … given the high scenic quality of the valley and sensitivity of the viewpoints along public footpaths and access land , the adverse effect on these views is considered significant			2
’ the council planning committee never discussed or voted on the solar farm because the local ward member , @entity203 @entity202 , decided not to refer it – as he was entitled to do			1
the @entity205 of @entity206 never , i ween , has fairer scene – @entity209 - blue and emerald - green , with the glow of the red red rock between , bathed in a glory of golden sheen , – gladdened your heart , or dazzled your een			2
there tarry a while , and gaze your fill , from @entity220 to @entity221 ; or turn your face to the north if you will , where the @entity12 range lies gloomy and still , and i ’ll wager a crown when you get back to town , bright visions will haunt you of @entity233			0
by @entity236 , whose poem features @entity237 - where the solar farm now sits ‘ i was content for the officers to deal with it , ’ he said			1
other councillors were more vociferous			0
‘ i was amazed when i saw how big it is , ’ said @entity244 @entity243			2
‘ i would very much have liked it to go to the committee			0
it is a scar on the landscape			0
’ climate historian @entity250 , who lives nearby , said : ‘ that so much pristine countryside can be swallowed without anyone picking this up through the democratic process suggests the system has failed			2
we ’ve ended up with an eyesore when we have no need for it			0
’ in october , environment secretary @entity260 told this newspaper that large solar farms were ‘ ugly , a blight on the countryside ’			1
in the middle of the @entity267 , the @entity265 poet @entity264 wrote the poem , @entity205 – part of which is reproduced on the right – describing the very spot where the farm , now nearing completion , lies			0
there is no fairer scene anywhere , he writes			0
on the @entity100 estate website , mr @entity110 describes himself and his family as ‘ custodians ’ of its landscape			0
asked whether he thought the poet might have thought the solar farm added to its beauty , he again refused to comment			0
in an email response yesterday , @entity284 said : ‘ overall this planning application received substantially more letters of support than objections			0
we believe the benefit to the public in the long run will outweigh any negativity			0
’ an earlier version of this article has been amended to make clear that @entity79 and @entity27 has sold its interest in the scheme to an associated company @entity51 which will receive the green subsidies and has been responsible for construction			1
the article previously described the farm as “ permanent ”			0
in fact permission is for 25 years .			0

@entity27 ' company developed 50 - acre solar panel farm on ridge in @entity15
@entity311 *'s* son - in - law will be paid *undisclosed* sums from his sale of the scheme
@entity317 ’s value is thanks to green *levies*
@entity68 say development is ‘ not sympathetic to character of the locality ’
site lies on @entity25 - an official @entity21
total annual income will be £ 770,000 of which £ 430,000 is green subsidies
