it may be the tallest obelisk and stone structure in the world			0
but the @entity4 - standing opposite the @entity5 and @entity6 - has shrunk			0
government surveyors have determined a new height for the @entity11 capital 's landmark - about 10in ( or 25cm ) shorter than it was 130 years ago			1
the @entity4 has shrunk by about 10 inches since it was built to honour @entity12 the new official measurement , which will be unveiled today , puts the monument at 554ft , 7in ( 169m ) as measured from the floor of the main entrance to the top			1
ever since the stone pillar was completed in 1884 to honour the nation 's first president @entity12 , the historic height has been recorded at 555ft , 5in ( 169.2m )			1
the only observable height change was the pyramid - shaped tip had been rounded off over time			2
surveyors in 1934 also noticed the peak had been rounded and attributed this to frequent lightning strikes that melted the aluminium tip. the graphic shows how the @entity12 monument was built over the years - it ran out of funding in 1858 but experts now dispute that and say the difference is down to where the base point is measured from			2
@entity38 , chief geodesist with the @entity39 , said : ' the building did n't change height because of anything ; it is just where you start from , ' the original measurement conducted in 1884 used four brass markers as a base for measurement			1
those markers remain in place 9in ( 22cm ) below ground â€“ and it is possible the markers were at ground level in the past			0
a new plaza was installed around the monument more recently , also likely changing ground level			0
despite the new measurement , the @entity60 said it would stick to the existing height and would not change any brochures			2
when the monument was completed in 1884 , it was the world 's tallest structure until 1889 when the @entity66 was built			1
it remains by far the tallest structure in the nation 's capital , which strictly restricts building heights			1
the monument was damaged during the @entity72 earthquake and @entity73 in 2011 and remained closed to the public while it was assessed and repaired			0
after 32 months of repairs , it reopened to visitors on may 12 , 2014			0
the monument has shrunk in size by 10 inches since 1888 , as the graphic demonstrates			0
