it was early evening in @entity1 and a crowd had gathered outside a boisterous bar			1
@entity5 and yellow - shirted , they stared through the window where a widescreen television was showing @entity10 ’s opening @entity12 match with @entity13			1
they were drinking beer and dancing their delight at the third @entity10 goal when the police car approached			1
it was moving slowly , with lights flashing			1
two officers sat impassively at the front and behind sat a third man , his face obscured and his arm hanging through the open window			1
his hand held a large gun , whose muzzle swung in an indolent arc , sweeping the street , the bar and the dancers			1
as the car rounded the corner , a few youngsters shouted discreet abuse			1
but the moment passed and soon they returned to the football			2
now clearly it would be quite wrong to read too much into a single , disturbing cameo			2
having spent five @entity12 weeks in the fascist dictatorship of @entity45 in 1978 , i am aware that @entity10 is no totalitarian state			1
but it is a land beset by savage inequality and social division , where order is frequently preserved by the fear of force , where threats are blatant and menace is meaningful			2
armed and dangerous : riot police stand at the ready during an @entity56 protest march on @entity58 beach those seething tensions have found a focus in widespread resentment of the £ 11 billion @entity12 investment			1
the fantasy that such a nation would cheerfully abandon its problems in favour of a month - long samba party has not survived the opening week of this tournament			1
yet , for all that , this simple game exerts a powerful hold upon the country ’s imagination			2
from the cradle they are made aware of the part that football played in shaping the nation			2
and the history is cherished			2
on the eve of the finals , a stream of pilgrims gathered at the statue of @entity85 at the entrance to the @entity87			2
there , holding high the @entity89 trophy , stands the captain of the team of ’ 58 , @entity10 ’s first world champions			1
fathers posed alongside sons , requesting strangers to take their picture			2
elderly ladies looked on , remembering those distant days , understanding the significance			2
small boys studied the bronze plaques at the base of the figure , each bearing the names of the five world - conquering teams			2
one or two read some of those names aloud and , fanciful though it sounds , they seemed to relish the familiar resonance			2
the year of ’ 58 gave us the likes of @entity113 and @entity114 , in ’ 62 we had @entity115 and @entity116 , in ’ 70 @entity117 and @entity118 , in ’ 94 @entity119 and @entity120 , in ’ 02 @entity121 and @entity122			2
and , of course , @entity123			0
@entity123 , the nonpareil , the spirit of @entity10			1
it is not so much a list , more a litany			0
if you wish to understand football ’s place in the @entity10 psyche , then the answers will be found in the shadow of @entity85			1
so if their love for the game is beyond question , then how to explain the recent poll in which 60 per cent of the population asserted that this @entity12 was a bad thing for @entity10			1
again , the reason lay in the staggering expenditure — £ 2bn on stadiums , more than £ 9bn on attendant infrastructure			1
and which sporting body formulates the swollen demands , lays down the conditions of contract and generally creates the climate in which such grotesque sums change hands ? it is , of course , @entity156 , that self - serving group of cheats , chancers and rampant rascals , along with the president whose tolerance of the intolerable has done so much to establish the image which his organisation enjoys today			0
survival instinct : @entity165 is posed to lead @entity156 for a fifth term as president say what you will about @entity165 — and so reduced is his reputation that we find ourselves able to say quite a lot — but marvel at his ability to survive for so long			0
as my favourite columnist once remarked when describing a fictional character : ‘ he could not be fishier if he came with a side helping of mushy peas			0
’ bribery , corruption , the selling of favours , the fixing of bids ; although not personally involved in any of these activities , @entity165 reacts to the deeds of the various miscreants with bogus indignation and a brass - necked refusal to recognise squalid reality			0
in an organisation blessed with even a smidgeon of self - respect , the extraordinary @entity194 vote - fixing revelations would have produced carnage on the executive floor and instant extinction for the president			0
instead , @entity165 accuses the @entity203 media of ‘ racism ’ and in doing so he succeeds in sinking below his own shabby standards			0
his recent actions have reeked of a worrying eccentricity ; the crass contradictions , the clumsy jests , the cringe - making dancing			0
last week , he came up with a back - of - an - envelope plan to protest a couple of decisions in every match			1
this , of course , is just what football needs : more dissent , more anarchy , more anger			0
and this from the most influential individual in the world game			0
it was genuinely pathetic , a crude attempt at diversion and distraction			0
truly , @entity165 is the @entity227 at this particular party			0
now , some insist that the organisation is rotten beyond reform , that it must be swept away and replaced by a new institution with radical ideas about valuing the game more dearly than the money it may generate			0
restoring order : @entity238 transformed the @entity239 and they may be right , although such a counsel of despair ignores the example of the @entity239 , similarly infested by sharks and charlatans until a @entity247 physician called @entity238 restored a rich measure of order , honour and all those qualities which are currently far beyond the reach of @entity156			0
but that will take time , more time than football can afford			0
the crisis is here and now			0
small wonder that @entity156 ’s major sponsors such as @entity259 , adidas , @entity261 and @entity262 have grown increasingly concerned at the danger of tainting their brands by association with this shameless crew			0
small wonder , too , that the people of @entity10 should be seriously concerned about their government ’s collaboration with such a brazen bunch			1
over the past few days , these people have shown themselves to be the most gracefully impressive of hosts			0
and they take justified pride in the fact that their country has given the game many of its greatest players and most of its greatest occasions			0
but the price of success has risen beyond reason and , in a land where reality can be cruelly unrewarding , they are questioning the prevailing priorities			0
it is all a far cry from @entity85 and his men of ’ 58 , when @entity123 began his golden journey and @entity10 football carried the promise of glory — and the price of the @entity12 was not plundered from the pockets of the poor			1
news reaches @entity297 that an old friend of this column is singing a familiar song			0
you may recall that @entity304 , as the acting @entity303 cricket coach , was once favoured to land the permanent job			1
a wretched run of results , a disastrous @entity309 tournament and defeat by the @entity311 scuppered his dreams			1
@entity304 accepted his fate but , inevitably , @entity314 detected a plot			1
‘ sadly , i think he was just too close to me for the @entity318 ’s liking , ’ he said			0
yet again , it was all about @entity314			1
in his world , it ’s always about @entity314			1
and still he wonders why we decline to take him seriously .			0

@entity10 government have invested £ *11billion* to host the @entity12
protests have continued by @entity10 in the opening week of the tournament
@entity314 thinks everything in @entity331 cricket is about him
