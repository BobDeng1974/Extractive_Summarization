by @entity0 letting her baking do the talking ; @entity3 says she encountered a barrage of abuse it is a show that is filled with the sweeter things in life ; cakes , puddings and kind judge @entity9			1
but @entity12 left a bitter taste in finalist @entity3 's mouth , who says she was subjected to ' lazy misogyny ' in a torrent of online abuse			1
former model @entity3 , who clashed with tv chef @entity19 when he suggested she was too thin to enjoy food , said she was ' surprised at just how much nastiness was generated from the show '			1
writing in @entity23 , she said : ' despite the saccharin sweetness of the @entity12 , an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators , both on social media and in the press			1
' many took to @entity33 decrying the demise of the show , voicing their hatred for certain bakers , and asserting ( week after week ! ) that they would ' never watch it again ' if x or @entity39 got through that episode ... how did a programme about cake become so divisive ? ' @entity3 , 21 , said criticism ranged from the gently cynical to the downright obnoxious , ' but as the series went on i noticed an increasing degree of personal vitriol and misogyny '			1
she added : ' we ( female ) finalists are supposedly too meek , too confident , too thin , too domestic , too smiley , too taciturn			0
' the contestant , who consistently won the applause from judges @entity9 and @entity55 on her instinctive baking skills , had been criticised for being emotional on the show			2
@entity3 's tears inside the @entity60 tent incurred the wrath of viewers , who shrieked insults at her online in one episode , presenter @entity66 , dabbed her nose when she was weeping during a stressful bake , and on another occasion , at the behest of @entity71 , told her to ' get a grip '			2
when she became too flustered			0
some fans of the show grew frustrated with the university student , who they claimed was cunningly portraying herself as fragile to win sympathy from the judges			2
but judge @entity55 defended the young baker , describing her as ' one of the most talented bakers who has walked in that tent '			0
as the runner - up became as much a talking point as her baking skills , chef @entity19 waded in on the commentary to deride ' female tears ' on the @entity90 show			1
the 63 - year - old chef sparked anger when he wrote on @entity33 , mistakenly referring to @entity3 as the show ’s winner : ' @entity12			1
not much skills , female tears and a winner so thin who makes me doubt of her love for great cooking , baking			2
' the @entity12 finalist @entity3 with her fellow competitors and the judges ( left to right ) @entity9 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity55 @entity3 hit back , writing : ' @ raymond - blanc ‘ female tears ’ ? ! and what has anyone ’s size got to do with it ? ' i do n’t care if you ’re a patisserie king - do n’t be an idiot			1
' @entity19 later apologised , tweeting co-host @entity55 : ' apologies if i upset people this morning			0
i would like to congratulate you on a show			0
best @entity121 ' @entity3 wondered in the article : ' what are ‘ female tears ’ , anyway ? are they more fragile and delicate than male tears ? do they wear pink ? ' and she added : ' if a show as gentle as @entity12 can stir up such a sludge of lazy misogyny in the murky waters of the internet , i hate to imagine the full scale of the problem			2
' @entity3 , who is studying for a philosophy degree , said in an interview with student magazine @entity138 that she was not bothered by accusations of favouritism			1
she said : ' it 's easy to brush it off because i know how it was in the tent - and there was no favouritism			0
it was all very fair so that does n't get to me very much			0
' despite the unexpected controversy around the finalist , the @entity90 show has pulled in the viewers and is set to move to @entity153 next year as a result of its rising ratings			0
the contest has had @entity90 's highest viewing figures so far this year with an average audience of seven million			0
the audience has grown from an average of 2.8 million for the first series in 2010 , peaking with 7.8 million a fortnight ago - more than even last year 's final , which drew a total of 7.2 million .			0
