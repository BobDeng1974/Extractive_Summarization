by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 21:48 est , 22 february 2013 an @entity2 tycoon who branded @entity4 workers lazy has now accused a government minister of being ‘ an imbecile ’			1
@entity7 took his war of words with the @entity4 government into a third day with a second stinging letter to the country ’s industry minister			1
in it , he told @entity15 that his country has ‘ beautiful women and fantastic wine ’ but ‘ no idea how to run a business ’			0
and he branded the minister ‘ an imbecile who is disconnected from reality ’			1
the initial outburst came after he had been approached by the @entity4 government to take over an @entity34 tyre factory to save 1,200 jobs			2
he refused to do so and told mr @entity15 he could ‘ keep his so - called workers ’ , who ‘ get one hour for breaks and lunch , talk for three and work for three ’			0
it prompted an angry riposte from the @entity4 government , with mr @entity15 accusing the head of @entity45 of ‘ perfect ignorance ’			2
' lazy ' : workers leaving the doomed @entity48 tire plant in @entity34 , northern @entity4 , which mr @entity7 has refused to rescue as @entity48 announces a 39 per cent cut to their @entity4 workforce mr @entity15 went on to say @entity2 is the top foreign investor in @entity4 , with 4,200 @entity2 companies employing nearly half a million people within the country			1
there was also a veiled threat , as he said the @entity4 government would look into mr @entity7 ’s company ’s finances with ‘ redoubled zeal ’			2
now mr @entity7 has written to mr @entity60 again , saying : ‘ your letter shows the extent to which your political class is disconnected from the real world			2
‘ you call me an extremist , but most businessmen would agree that i would be mad to spend millions buying up a @entity4 tyre factory only to pay some of the highest salaries in the world			2
@entity71 : the @entity45 boss was scathing in his assessment of the work ethic of staff at the @entity48 factory in @entity34 ‘ your letter did not mention why the @entity4 government has not stepped in to rescue this @entity48 tyre factory			1
the extremists are in your government , who have no idea how to build a business			0
' i never said i would lower @entity4 salaries			0
i only said that if i am paying people to do seven hours work , i expect them to do at least six hours			0
’ but he added : ‘ @entity4 does have beautiful women and great wine			0
also my grandmother named my father after @entity4 entertainer @entity92 , and i inherited the name			0
’ mr @entity7 then let rip again on @entity4 ’s @entity95 1 radio yesterday morning , telling the presenter : ‘ @entity97 stupid , or what ? ‘ you want to talk about the @entity48 factory , so why are you talking to me ? you should be talking to that imbecile			1
’ ' the @entity4 way ' : mr @entity7 wrote to the @entity4 industry minister @entity15 ( left ) saying that @entity4 workers are ' lazy '			1
he said he visited the factory in @entity34 ( right ) several times where the ' workforce gets paid high wages but works only three hours ' mr @entity7 ’s tirades have sparked outrage in @entity4 ’s socialist media , but they prompted right - wing daily paper @entity112 to suggest : ‘ perhaps he ’s right ? ’ the row comes as @entity4 teeters on the brink of recession and unemployment has hit three million – the highest level of joblessness in 15 years			1
a report by @entity122 bank @entity121 found the @entity4 graft for just 1,480 hours a year , with 27 days annual holiday – meaning they have more free time than any other nation on the planet			0
@entity129 work 1,782 hours a year – 301 more than the @entity4 – and have 20 days ’ holiday a year , making us the world ’s 36th most lazy nation , it was found .			0
