by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 17:37 est , 15 october 2013 @entity1 has taken a jab at vice president @entity3 by questioning his support for the @entity6 raid			1
the dig marks an important line of offense for @entity10 as @entity3 would be her strongest competition if they both decide to run as the next @entity14 nominee for president in 2016			1
at a conference in @entity18 on tuesday , the former secretary of state told a version of events where she was in favor of giving the @entity23 mission the go - ahead to kill the terrorist but @entity3 was more uncertain			1
competitors : @entity1 and @entity3 ( seen here together in 2011 ) are widely considered the most likely candidates for the @entity14 presidential nominee in 2016 @entity10 spoke at the @entity30 and a politician in the audience told the local paper about what she said			1
' i know she â€™s running for president now , because toward the end , she was asked about the @entity6 raid			2
she took 25 minutes to answer , ' state representative @entity40 told the @entity41			0
' without turning the knife too deeply , she put it to ( vice president joe ) biden			0
' no press was allowed inside the event , but @entity40 reported that she portrayed herself as being one of the strongest supporters of the raid - alongside then - @entity52 director @entity51			0
in the room : @entity10 said that she was in support of the may 2011 raid while @entity3 was more cautious and concerned by contrast , she mentioned that @entity3 was against the raid multiple times during the speech			1
the success of the raid is a significant and @entity10 knows it : @entity10 even talked about @entity65 's decision to give the raid the go - ahead during a campaign tv spot during the 2012 re-election			0
neither @entity10 nor @entity3 have officially announced that they 're running to take over the @entity71 after president @entity65 's second term ends in 2016 , but their actions have been speaking for them			2
@entity10 has made a number of speeches at conferences after taking a break from the public eye following the end of her term as a cabinet member in january			0
picking sides ? many read into president @entity65 's decision to be interviewed for the first time after being re-elected alongside @entity10 instead of @entity3 publicly supportive : vice president @entity3 spoke at the @entity89 conference late last month , as the event is run by his possible rival and her husband as she was leaving office , she sat down for a televised interview along with president @entity65 , and that was viewed in political circles as a silent endorsement by her former competitor as he chose to have @entity10 in that interview and not his vice president			1
@entity3 has been doing his own campaigning , however , as he attended a function in the crucial primary battleground state of @entity106 last month			2
even still , that might not be enough as three of president @entity65 's top aides have all publicly stated that they think the @entity14 nomination belongs to @entity10			0
' i think that @entity1 probably will be the candidate			0
if she does n't run , i think @entity3 will run , ' former senior @entity71 advisor @entity112 said in a june interview according to @entity114 .			2

the former secretary of state spoke out about the decision to order the @entity23 to kill @entity6
said that she pushed for it and @entity3 was more cautious
both she and @entity3 are seen as front runners in 2016 race
