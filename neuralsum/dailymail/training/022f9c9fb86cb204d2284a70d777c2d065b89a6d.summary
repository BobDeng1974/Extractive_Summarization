and it seems a face mask and a glass of wine in front of @entity17 would n’t quite do the trick			2
instead , the duchess has flown to southern @entity3 for a secret week - long retreat at a ‘ holistic heath centre ’			1
there , she can take advantage of customised dawn yoga sessions and ‘ spiritually healing ’ ayurvedic massages			2
@entity26 arrived at the @entity27 in @entity28 on saturday with a party of ten , which is believed to include members of her family as well as a personal assistant and her @entity34 bodyguards			1

it is understood that @entity26 is staying in the centre ’s £ 3,500 - a - night presidential suite			1
measuring 2,500 sq ft , it boasts three bedrooms , a fruit garden , an open air shower and its own lotus pond			2
the duchess enjoyed a four - night stay in the same suite when she and @entity35 visited the country for the @entity50 in 2010			1
although the couple were on an official visit , that trip , like the current one , was paid for by her husband and did not cost taxpayers , aside from the cost of her @entity34 security team			2
the retreat claims to be a ‘ unique facility that helps restore the natural balance of your mind , body and spirit ’			2
it is set within a 30 - acre organic farm and guests follow a strict ovo - vegetarian diet , paying around £ 140 a day for a range of different treatments			1
they include ‘ hydrowashes ’ , reflexology , and a ‘ four - hand ’ @entity75 massage carried out by two female therapists			2
on her first visit @entity26 was said to have tried abhayanka , a massage with medicated oil , and shirodhara , where warm oil is poured on the forehead			1
one insider revealed that the last time the duchess stayed she undertook daily dawn yoga and meditation sessions			0
‘ she could do the difficult asanas [ poses ] with ease			0
it seems she has done yoga before , ’ they said			0
@entity26 was also said to have had several ayurvedic massages			1

spiritual : prince @entity35 and @entity26 are seen near @entity101 on a visit to @entity3 in 2006 a spokesman for the clinic has declined to comment on their royal guest			1

high - profile fans include @entity129 and @entity130			0
@entity75 , which means ‘ science of life ’ in @entity133 , is based on the idea that all matter is composed of five elements – air , fire , water , earth and space			0
these combine in the body as biological forces , or ‘ doshas ’ , called vata , pitta and kapha			0
@entity75 views the balance of these forces in the body as good health and their imbalance as the cause of disease			0
