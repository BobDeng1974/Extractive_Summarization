although , if you think @entity12 and @entity14 - cities typically known for their comedy clubs and improv schools - top the list , think again			1
the top three funniest cities in @entity10 are @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , respectively - according to researchers at the @entity24 's @entity23 hardy - har : @entity19 has been ranked as the funniest city in @entity10 , over legendary comedy towns like @entity12 and @entity14 @entity20 : touring comedians rank @entity20 high on their lists in terms of quality of audience , which is part of the reason it got the number two spot hot - lanta : it may not seem like it , but @entity21 , @entity39 , is the third funniest city in @entity10 , according to science ' i think what ends up happening is that the nature of @entity12 is at a bit of an advantage when it comes to humor , but it ’s also at a disadvantage because there ’s a lot of things to do in @entity12 that pulls the population in different directions , ' @entity54 , the professor who created the algorithm as part of “ @entity57 , ” a new book about what makes things funny , and why , told @entity61			1
according to @entity54 , @entity12 was near the top of the list in terms of a city that relies on humor to cope with stress			2
additionally , the city is home to some comedic institutions , like @entity71 and the @entity73 improv school			2
@entity12 is also home to several late - night talk shows like the @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , to name a few			2
@entity54 also says that @entity12 is a good place for a young comedian to get their start , given the large number of comedy clubs in the @entity85			0
poor showing : @entity12 was n't even ranked in the top five , coming in sixth in the rankings for @entity10 's funniest cities " ' if you want to continue training , go to @entity12 , ’ ” @entity54 quoted comedian @entity89 telling him			1
“ ‘ if you think you ’re ready to get in the ring , go to @entity14 ’ ” but @entity54 says comedy is n't for everyone in @entity12 the way it is in other cities			1
' we wanted to look at not just what are the commercial and entertainment aspects of the comedy but how much the locals value it , ' @entity54 said			0
@entity54 also explained how @entity20 is n't necessarily known for its comedy scene , but that touring comedians rate audiences in @entity20 amongst the highest in any city in @entity10			0
in @entity19 - which topped @entity54 's list - there are several comedy troupes - like @entity111 - that are favorites of many of the locals			1
@entity114 : despite being home to some legendary comedy clubs , @entity14 ranked seventh on the list and @entity111 has put out its share of comedic stars - @entity71 has fed off of the troupe for more than 40 years , making stars out of @entity111 alums like @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
soon - to - be @entity75 host @entity127 also is an alum of @entity19 's @entity111			2
because quantifying something like humor is tough - if not impossible - to do , @entity54 says he 's confident in his rankings and says they were compiled with a great deal of debate over how to measure certain aspects of a city and make it fair for all cities			0
in addition to analyzing a city 's professional comedy scene , @entity54 also polled people on things like how much their workplaces valued humor			0
' i want people to want to be number one because this is such an important part of life , ' he said			0
' who would n’t want to live in the city that is ranked as the funniest ? '			0

the rankings were compiled by researchers from the @entity24 's ' @entity156 '
@entity12 and @entity14 did n't even rank in the top five
@entity19 is home to the @entity111 , which has seen dozens of its alums go on to be in the cast of @entity71
