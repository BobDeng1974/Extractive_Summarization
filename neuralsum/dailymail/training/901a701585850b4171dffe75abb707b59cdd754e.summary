by @entity0 for most people , a trip to the zoo is an occasional treat			2
but when little @entity6 first paid a visit , back in 1937 , the thrill was such that she 's been going back to the same one every two weeks ever since ... clocking up more than 2,000 trips			1
now , after seven decades of visiting @entity9 , in the @entity10 , 87 - year - old @entity6 has been given a life membership to what she calls her ' second home '			1
during a recent ceremony , staff at the zoo also presented her with her own bench ( engraved in her honour ) next to the monkey enclosure , along with a knapsack containing a thermos and packet of biscuits			2
the animal - loving pensioner , from @entity16 , said : ' when i heard that a zoo was opening , i begged my mum that she would take me and my younger sister			2
my first ever visit was just magical			0
i had never seen exotic animals			2
' on the opening day , we waited for hours upon end as queues to get in snaked around the block and my mum wanted to give up and go home , but i begged her to stay			0
' when we got in , it was worth every minute that we waited and i felt like i was taken to another world			0
' after her first visit aged 10 , on the day it opened , @entity6 fell in love with the zoo and went as often as she could as a teenager , scraping together any cash she could get hands on to pay for her admission			1
the pensioner has become somewhat of a vip at the zoo and is invited to any special events the animal - loving pensioner said : ' when i heard that a zoo was opening , i begged my mum that she would take me and my younger sister			2
my first ever visit was just magical			0
i had never seen exotic animals ' @entity6 , who catches two buses and makes a three - hour round trip to the zoo , has even adopted 23 of the animals @entity6 said : ' visiting the zoo during the war was a bit of a challenge , as everyone had to concentrate on the war effort			1
' adding to that , the zoo had irregular opening hours because of air raid scares and the blackouts			0
' nevertheless , i still tried to go as much as possible and i used to take any food scraps for the animals , as food was scarce for humans let alone animals - and so i felt sorry for them			1
' the pensioner - who has never married nor has any children - catches two buses and makes a three - hour round trip to the zoo , and has even adopted 23 of the animals			1
the former auxiliary nurse said her favourite animal are the tigers			1
she said : ' i was lucky enough to even be invited to a special audience to watch one of the tigers , @entity101 , give birth to her cubs			0
' the whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and it was such an amazing spectacle			0
' the pensioner has become somewhat of a vip at the zoo and is invited to any special events			0
@entity6 knows all of the staff well , saying : ' they do treat me very well and they let me hold some of the smaller animals whenever i go			1
' they will send a car for me if there is a function but i do n't like all the fuss and would even go if i had to walk all the way there			0
' @entity6 , with staff from the zoo , as she sits on a bench engraved with her name for being one of their favourite supporters the former auxiliary nurse said her favourite animal are the tigers			1
she said : ' i was lucky enough to even be invited to a special audience to watch one of the tigers , @entity101 , give birth to her cubs ' as one of the zoo 's very first customers and certainly being its most loyal , @entity6 said she has seen a lot of changes and has some great memories			1
she said : ' i particularly hold fond in my heart memories from the great summer of 1969			0
the atmosphere at the zoo was so electric and everyone had a blast			0
' everyone was happy because of the glorious weather and people were eating ice cream after ice cream to keep cool			0
' even the elephants who are used to high heats were having to be constantly cooled down with big buckets of water			0
' now that i 'm saving on an annual pass , i 'll be able to spend more money on treats for my favourite animals , ' said the pensioner @entity6 said : ' i just love @entity9 , it 's a very special place for me and i never tire of it ' @entity165 , ceo of @entity9 , said : ' @entity6 has been a season ticket holder for more years than she cares to remember and paid her first visit to the zoo as a ten - year - old schoolgirl , with her father and sister in 1937			1
' she visits at least twice a month , regardless of the weather , and has been with us constantly throughout the good and bad times			0
' over the years , she has adopted many animals within the collection and knows all the members of staff on the keeping sections and offers encouragement and support in their projects			2
' we often joke that @entity6 knows more about the zoo than we do			2
' @entity6 said : ' i just love @entity9 , it 's a very special place for me and i never tire of it			1
' i can not imagine life without the zoo - the staff are like family and it 's the most magical place			1
