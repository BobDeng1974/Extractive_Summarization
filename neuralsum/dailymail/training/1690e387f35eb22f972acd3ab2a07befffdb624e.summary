the world could be on the brink of an outbreak of a deadly and ‘ virtually untreatable ’ strain of drug resistant tuberculosis unless immediate action is taken , doctors have warned			1
the first cases of ' totally drug - resistant ' tuberculosis have been found in @entity9 , according to a new paper published in the @entity13 's @entity12 journal			1
clinics across the country ravaged by the bacterial lung infection , have reported an explosion in the number of patients struck down with a virulent strain			1
outbreak : a tuberculosis sufferer receives treatment in hospital for the disease which health organisations warn is becoming drug resistant			1
( @entity28 picture ) fears are mounting that conventional treatments would be next to useless in the face of the new disease , which killed 1.4 million people globally in 2011 , according to the @entity35			1
the disease is particularly prevalent in @entity9 , where high rates of @entity38 means the immune systems of many more people are susceptible to infections			2
but compounding the problem is the higher cases in which the illness is only partially treated			0
this has led to the disease evolving into a strain which is not vulnerable to antibiotics			2
dr @entity49 , who treats tb sufferers in a @entity9 clinic , has horrific first - hand experience of the new disease after contracting a strain himself			0
he underwent three years of agonising treatment after contracting the new multi drug - resistant disease - only surviving after undergoing a cocktail of powerful drugs which caused life - threatening side effects			1
warning : doctors have seen an increase in the number of patients being diagnosed with drug resistant strains of @entity64			1
( @entity28 picture ) mr @entity49 contracted @entity66 , a complication from the treatment that causes layers of skin to separate from each other which caused him regularly to bleed from his eyes			0
he told @entity73 : ' the @entity64 does n't feel like it 's killing you , but the drugs do , ' adding : ' my case was three years long			0
i do n't think the average patient has that kind of patience			0
' as far back as march 2010 , the @entity35 warned that in some areas of the world , one in four people with tuberculosis were being struck down with the ' disease that can no longer be treated with standard drugs regimens '			0
after widespread vaccination in much of the developed world , the disease has been largely isolated in 22 so - called ' high burden ' countries - including @entity9			2
these poorer regions account for around 80 per cent of global cases of @entity64			2
but it is feared not enough is being done to tackle the growing problem , which is not limited to @entity9			0
a @entity96 was hit by a multi drug - resistant @entity64 outbreak in the early ' 90s			1
of the 32 patients who caught the infection , 29 died			0
serious outbreaks have also been reported in @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 during the last ten years , despite drug companies developing a new generation of treatments , experts have warned more action needs to be taken and new drugs brought out			2
@entity111 , coordinator of the @entity35 's @entity64 department on drug resistance told @entity73 : ' it 's encouraging we have a few drugs in the pipeline , but we need several new ones , with new mechanisms of action , to protect against new resistances			0

clinics see explosion in cases of ' drug resistant ' bacterial lung infections
conventional antibiotics *powerless* to combat new disease
medics fear repeat of @entity96 outbreak which killed 90 *%* of those infected
experts call for more action to tackle infections in poorer countries
