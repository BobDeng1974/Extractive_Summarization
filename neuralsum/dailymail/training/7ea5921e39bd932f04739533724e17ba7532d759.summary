@entity0 suffered yet another defeat at the hands of @entity3 rivals @entity4 on sunday , going down 2 - 0 at @entity6 courtesy of goals from @entity8 and @entity9			1
after @entity12 's latest setback we asked @entity0 fan site @entity13 what went wrong in west @entity3 and where the @entity16 is going wrong			1
nothing at @entity0 will improve until the three years of @entity12 's contract are up and we can bring in fresh ideas with an approach that puts planning and detail at the core			1
the failings of @entity12 's summer transfer planning were once again exposed against @entity4 , who delivered two killer blows to extend the @entity0 manager 's winless streak to 12 against @entity29			1
this lack of foresight is always our undoing			0
the same mistakes are made every year			0
the same result occurs every year			0
fourth place is where we 'll finish because that 's where we deserve to finish			2
@entity0 boss @entity12 watches from the touchline as his side lose 2 - 0 to @entity3 rivals @entity41 @entity0 's @entity42 ( left ) and @entity43 ( right ) react during their defeat at @entity6 @entity8 ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring from the penalty spot against @entity48 the game itself was an improvement on the kamikaze tactics of last season that saw us lose by six goals			1
we turned up with a plan and on a different day , with a referee who had guts , the result may have been more favourable			0
what the game exposed was the lack of forward thinking from @entity12 , a man traditionally synonymous with the act			1
that result was n't a blip , it was the continuation of a managerial slide from grace which has seen @entity12 go from one of the most revered masters of the beautiful game , to a man who is cannon fodder against the great teams			1
our summer was n't a complete disaster , but it was tantamount to the amateur diyer who leaves every project half baked			2
the rooms are liveable , but they 're never going to draw gasps of awe , and every so often a window will pop or a bookshelf will drop			2
a constant reminder of a lack of planning and effort to deliver the best possible product			0
@entity0 made three huge mistakes this summer			1
firstly , we did n't address our need for a better striker until @entity92 picked up a severe injury			0
we let superstars such as @entity95 pass us by when really , we should have had competition in place for that role in june			1
the result is a very disjointed front line that does n't know how to trouble top teams at the moment			0
that will come , but the importance of bedding players in early can never be underestimated			0
@entity12 should 've moved for striker @entity95 ( right ) , who joined @entity106 from @entity107 summer signing @entity9 seals @entity4 's 2 - 0 win over @entity0 with a neat lob late in the game the second major failing is one we 've struggled with since @entity114 left three years ago			1
we do n't have a defensive midfielder			1
the purists bleat on about the position being redundant , despite it being clear we need a big cynical lump in place to block the goal			0
@entity4 have that in @entity122 , a total monster who allows @entity125 to do his job			2
we have @entity127 , an average free transfer who could n't find a club until we let him train with us and @entity131 - a player well past his peak			2
if we had a @entity122 , we 'd have secured three points against @entity135 and on sunday @entity8 would have been wiped out on his way to winning a penalty			0
the @entity139 have failed to replace defensive midfielder @entity114 ( centre ) , who is on loan at @entity143 @entity127 ( right ) can not compare to @entity4 's @entity122 in the defensive midfield role finally , we did n't secure a third senior centre back			1
this was an obvious requirement since last season when @entity149 fell out with the manager			0
we have @entity151 who looks disinterested and @entity152 who looks dead on his feet			0
we ca n't make any changes because we do n't have any options			0
inept centre back displays ca n't be rectified because we sold without a plan in place			1
@entity160 was free in the summer , @entity159 was also available and @entity143 's captain @entity161 is a contract rebel			2
not the best players , but more than capable of coming in at third choice			0
why did n't we move ? why is inaction always preferable with @entity12 ? follow @entity13 on @entity166 @ @entity167 like our @entity168 .			2

@entity0 lost 2 - 0 to @entity3 rivals @entity4 at @entity6
@entity12 's side have a poor record against the @entity174 and the @entity16 has never beaten @entity29
the @entity139 should 've signed a top class striker like @entity95 earlier in the summer
@entity12 has failed to replace @entity114 with a quality defensive midfielder
he should have also signed another centre back in the transfer window
