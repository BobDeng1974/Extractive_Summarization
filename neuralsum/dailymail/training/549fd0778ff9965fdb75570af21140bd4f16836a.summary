by @entity0 published : 07:06 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 12:18 est , 3 march 2014 four women who underwent womb transplants have had embryos implanted into them to try and get them pregnant			1
since 2012 , nine women have received wombs donated by relatives in an experimental procedure			1
the treatment is designed to test whether it is possible to transfer a uterus into a woman so she can give birth to her own child			0
hope : four @entity16 women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get them pregnant the women had @entity21 before the transplant , using their own eggs to make embryos			1
' we have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready , ' said dr @entity30 , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the @entity33 , who is leading the research			1
@entity35 ( pictured ) , from @entity36 , had a transplant in august 2011			2
she subsequently conceived but then miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy he would not say whether any of the women are pregnant			2
of the nine who got transplanted wombs , two had to have them removed because of complications			2
one previous high profile case was that of @entity35 , from @entity36			0
she has a womb transplant in august 2011 and subsequently conceived , but then miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy			1
@entity48 predicted that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth			2
' one or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry and one or two wo n't be able to get pregnant , ' he said			0
dr @entity30 said any woman who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high - risk pregnancy			2
he added that some women had received their new wombs from their mothers and there was a higher rate of complications with older uteruses			1
eight of the nine women who were given transplants suffer from @entity70 syndrome , a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing , but means she still has intact ovaries which produce eggs			1
this means a woman 's egg could be fertilised outside of her body and the embryo then placed in her womb			0
the ninth woman had her womb removed after suffering cervical cancer			0
the development of womb transplants has given hope to thousands of childless women across @entity87 and at least 15,000 in the @entity88			1
the women had @entity21 before the transplant , using their own eggs to make embryos the method has been controversial though because it involves taking wombs from living donors			1
the @entity16 team favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a better immunological match			0
but other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not life - saving			0
about one girl in 4,500 is born with @entity70 , where she does n't have a womb			1
dr @entity30 said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies			0
' based on our previous work and animal studies , we are optimistic , ' he said			0
' but we can not guarantee anything			0

since 2012 , nine women have received wombs donated by relatives
most of them have @entity70 syndrome , which prevents womb from developing
women had @entity21 before the transplant , using own eggs to make embryos
