the three new beach chalets will be big enough to have bedroom accommodation but they ca n't be lived in year round			2
it is thought mr @entity8 would look to let them to holidaymakers rather than sell them			2

you 'd be forgiven for thinking a one bedroom cabin costing £ 350,000 is a unique lot on the housing market			0
but , in parts of the @entity5 , these tiny ‘ properties ’ come with massive price tags			0
