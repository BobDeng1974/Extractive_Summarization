after accusations of ludicrous storylines and legal blunders broadchurch viewers have accused scriptwriters of their most unrealistic twist yet - table service from @entity6 's			1
disgruntled fans have complained after @entity9 's character @entity8 was seen in the latest episode of @entity12 's crime show , set in @entity13 , ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table			1
at the @entity19 fast food chain , customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time			1
over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes			1
the first episode frustrated viewers with its ‘ mumbling ’ dialogue and the second was littered with legal blunders			1
episode three included unrealistic scenes in which a mother appeared in court shortly after giving birth – and her baby appeared to be much older than a newborn			1
and many turned to @entity29 to condemn the show when high - flying black lawyer @entity58 , played by @entity60 - nominated @entity59 , was portrayed as a single mother			2
her son is the only black male character in the show			2
he is in prison and there is no sign of a father figure in his life			2
elsewhere mother @entity70 , played by @entity71 , prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of @entity74 a short time after an easy water birth			1
but last night fans complained on @entity29 that the latest scene with @entity78 and his family in the fast - food chain @entity27 was the most unrealistic to date			1
' i can see why everyone complains about # @entity24 being unrealistic now - table service at @entity27 ? whatever next ! ' said viewer @entity84			1
character @entity70 ( @entity71 ) was seen giving birth just hours before giving evidence in court seemingly just hours after the birth , @entity71 and @entity88 as @entity70 and @entity89 were seen in court viewers have also pointed out @entity70 's baby , @entity93 , looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold her head up at just 24 hours old another fan , @entity96 , tweeted : ' urmmm since when do @entity27 do table service ? hahaha			1
' @entity98 added : ' is the most unrealistic thing in # @entity24 table service at @entity27 ? ' whilst @entity101 tweeted : ' @entity24 even got the ordering in @entity27 wrong ! ' @entity27 's , which specialises in chicken dishes and is famous for its peri-peri sauce , opened its first @entity106 restaurant in 1992			1
the first series of @entity24 premiered in march 2013 and was nominated for seven @entity109 awards			1
it focused on the death of an 11 - year - old boy and the impact of grief and media attention on the town			2
most of the cast has returned for the second series			1
viewers have previously that during the second series they have had to use subtitles as lead actor @entity9 ' mumbles ' and speaks in a strong @entity124 accent			1
digging up @entity126 's corpse			1
what happened : @entity129 ’s parents @entity70 and @entity89 with prosecuting barrister @entity130 were horrified after @entity74 ’s defence team got @entity126 ’s body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family			2
but retired detective @entity137 told the @entity138 : ‘ the body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation			2
you would have to consult the family beforehand			2
the only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case			2
’ use of spy cameras what happened : @entity8 installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of @entity156 - where a terrified @entity157 is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from @entity161			0
@entity8 installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of @entity156 , but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court but @entity137 explains : ‘ i ’m afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court			0
of course , if you suspect somebody of an offence , you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent			0
’ the wrong wig what happened : @entity179 ( @entity180 ) is the judge in the case of @entity74 but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case			0
why @entity70 would never have been interrogated about her sex life what happened : the judge allows the defence barrister to question @entity126 ’s mother about her sex life and the affair her husband @entity89 had with a woman called @entity194 , even though it has no obvious connection to the murder			0
but criminal barrister @entity198 explains : ‘ the sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed			0
there is no relevance whatsoever			0
' could @entity70 and @entity89 really select their own criminal barrister ? what happened : @entity126 ’s grieving parents choose retired local lawyer @entity130 as their prosecution barrister			0
but legal expert @entity208 says : ‘ the whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of @entity214			0
@entity126 ’s grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life ‘ they are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim ’s family does not get to choose the barrister			0
’ witnesses ca n't stay to watch trial what happened : @entity126 ’s parents @entity70 and @entity89 , along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence			0
but @entity198 says : ‘ witnesses can not sit through any part of the proceedings , nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part			0
they should never have been in court			0
’ how come the new suspect turns up everywhere ? what happened : @entity243 ( @entity244 ) – who is the prime suspect in the @entity246 abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at @entity8			0
but bemused viewers have wondered exactly how @entity243 has been able to track down @entity8 everywhere he goes so easily			1
@entity243 ( @entity244 ) , the prime suspect in the @entity246 abductions , has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up everywhere the newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old what happened : those who watched last night 's show criticised a storyline in which new mother @entity70 , played by @entity71 , returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth			1
viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old			2
a one in 7,000 occurrence fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female @entity273 judge , a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel			0
in 2010 , 35 % of barristers were women , and 10 % were from ethnic minorities			0
meanwhile in 2011 , 22 % of judges were women and 5 % were from ethnic minorities			0
that makes the diversity likelihood of the @entity24 trial a one in 7,000 occurrence .			0

viewers complained after characters ordered chicken dinners from a waiter
at @entity27 's customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time
second series has come under fire for inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes
but the latest gaffe has been deemed the most unrealistic mistake to date
