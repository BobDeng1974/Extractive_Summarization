the body of a shirtless man killed by @entity2 is picked up from the middle of a dirt road in @entity5 , the capital of @entity6 , and carried away by health workers			2
the shocking images , which are being taken in @entity9 on a daily basis , highlight how the outbreak is spiraling out of control - and medical officials are yet to find a cure			1
but experts believe an unusual treatment may help combat the disease , one which involves using the blood of those who have survived the deadly virus			1
he is suspected of dying due to the ebola virus ' this is something that 's fairly simple to do , ' said dr. @entity33 , director of @entity35 's @entity34 and @entity36 and the co-discoverer of the ebola virus			2
more than 200 experts , assembled by the @entity40 , have gathered in @entity41 for a two day conference			1
the group are looking at issues of safety and effectiveness and considering which treatments should be prioritized for testing during the current outbreak			1
there are around a half dozen medicines and vaccines in development			1
none has been tested on humans but an early trial of one vaccine began this week in the @entity57			2
much attention has focused on the unproven drug @entity61 , which was given to seven patients , two of whom died			1
but the limited supply is now exhausted and its developer says it will take months to make even a modest amount			2
in contrast , @entity40 's blood network , an international group of blood regulators , noted recently there are thousands of survivors from past @entity2 outbreaks in @entity9 who could be tapped as a source			0
the group said blood from survivors should be considered experimental and recommended that studies be done during the crisis			1
his corpse was left on a dirt road in the middle of the @entity6 capital with pedestrians ignoring the body as they waked past in another document published this week , @entity40 estimated the first batches of survivor blood could be available by the end of the year			0
the agency said it had identified several recovered patients as potential donors , but acknowledged ' logistics of blood collection are an issue			1
' some scientists think antibodies in the blood of @entity2 survivors could help patients infected with the deadly disease			1
antibodies are produced by the body 's immune system to fight off harmful things like viruses			0
they remain in the blood ready to fight off any future infections by the same foreign substance			0
@entity33 said it is vital to find out if the blood treatment is effective			0
' i hope this is the last @entity2 outbreak where all we have is isolation , quarantine and supportive care to treat patients , ' he said			1
experts say blood from survivors could be collected and processed for multiple patients , or a survivor could donate blood to an individual patient			1
both methods require screening the blood for diseases like hiv or malaria			0
a health worker sprays the body of the dead man as a crowd surrounds the gruesome scene while direct donation would be easier , the levels of ebola - fighting antibodies produced by a survivor can vary			1
ideally , experts said , the amount of antibodies should be measured			2
' with drugs , you can at least do some quality control , ' said @entity150 , an @entity2 expert at the @entity151 at @entity152			0
' if you 're just taking blood blindly from ( survivors ) without testing it for antibody levels , how can we predict what outcome they will have ? ' in @entity9 , there have been no organized attempts to use the blood of survivors to treat patients			2
blood from a 14 - year - old boy who survived @entity2 was given in july to @entity57 doctor @entity167 , who was infected in @entity6			1
@entity167 also got some @entity168 and was released from an @entity170 hospital last month			1
it 's unknown whether the drug or the boy 's blood aided his recovery			0
blood from survivors of diseases including @entity2 , bird flu and anthrax has been used in the past when doctors ran out of options and seems to work best in diseases where there 's a toxin , like anthrax and tetanus			0
medical workers from the @entity6 @entity190 load another body into the back of a van in @entity5 health worker 's spray each other with disinfectant chemicals after dealing with the corpse of the @entity2 with a victim in @entity5 , @entity6 for treating @entity2 , ' you would need to come up with how much you should give , how long , and what 's a safe infusion rate , ' said dr. @entity202 , director of @entity203 at the @entity204			0
' if you know what the potency of the serum is , you could theoretically help the body clear @entity2 out of their cells before it can do too much damage			0
' dr. @entity212 , who recently worked in @entity2 clinics in @entity214 for @entity216 's partnership with the country , said local hospitals should be able to provide survivors ' blood if doctors want to offer it			0
so far , more than 3,000 people have been infected			1
last week , @entity40 estimated there could be another 20,000 cases before the @entity2 outbreak is stopped , a figure @entity212 described as unfortunate but realistic			2
visual artists walk with placards during a rally in @entity231 , the capital of the @entity232 the ebola virus which is effecting neighbouring countries ' it does give us the opportunity to try some new therapies , ' he said			0
' and as long as they are not harmful , why should n't we try to do something , hopefully help some patients and learn from this ? ' health officials are monitoring more than 200 people who may have been exposed to @entity2 in southern @entity246 and are working to find more people at risk in a race to contain the disease 's spread in @entity9 's most populous country			1
authorities had been cautiously optimistic that they would be able to keep @entity246 's outbreak relatively small			2
the sick @entity6 - @entity57 who brought the disease to @entity246 by plane was quickly isolated and officials said they were successfully monitoring the people who were in contact with him			1
but then last month , one of those contacts escaped surveillance and fled to the southern oil hub of @entity266			0
he infected a doctor who , in turn , exposed dozens of people to the disease when he continued treating patients after he began having @entity2 symptoms , the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) has said			1
elsewhere in @entity9 , the outbreak is spinning out of control , killing about 1,900 people so far , according to the @entity40			1
@entity276 , @entity6 and @entity214 have each recorded hundreds of deaths and the disease most recently spread to @entity279			0
there are no known casess of @entity2 in @entity282 , but the problem is beginning to spiral out of control in neighbouring countries including @entity276 , @entity214 and @entity6 in southern @entity246 , 200 people have been identified as having been exposed to the ill doctor and are being monitored , the @entity40 said			1
about 60 of those are considered at a high risk of getting @entity2			0
officials are urgently tracking down more contacts and educating residents about the disease , dr @entity293 , the health commissioner for @entity294 , where @entity266 is located , said			0
rumour , fear and confusion about @entity2 , which is more typically found in @entity297 , have helped to fuel its spread			0
some people hide their symptoms or avoid medical care , seeing hospitals as places where people simply go to die			2
@entity246 officials have urged people in @entity266 not to panic			2
@entity307 , an oil worker , said he felt the local authorities had put in place adequate measures to curtail the disease			0
but others worry that @entity2 will spread			0
' i am very afraid because of the manner the disease is spreading , ' said @entity316 , a hotel manager in @entity266			0
' i have to be cautious because i do n't want to be the next victim			0
' so far , more than 3,000 people have been infected and around 1,900 people are thought to have died			1
last week , @entity40 estimated there could be another 20,000 cases before the @entity2 outbreak is stopped			2

*warning* : @entity324
the method is one of the experimental treatments under discussion
more than 200 experts have assembled for a two - day meeting in @entity41
there are around half a dozen medicines and vaccines in development
@entity339 has concentrated on @entity168 , which has been given to seven patients
so far more than 3,000 people have been infected during the outbreak
