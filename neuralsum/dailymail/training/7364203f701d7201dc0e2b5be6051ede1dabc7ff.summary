@entity2 's shadow education secretary @entity1 , himself privately - educated , said the most immoral people he has met went to public schools public schools produce some of the ‘ singularly most immoral people ’ in society , @entity2 ’s shadow education secretary has claimed in an extraordinary swipe at the independent sector			1
@entity1 , who was privately - educated himself , risked angering parents and children with his outspoken criticism of former pupils of private schools			1
he also risks riling his political opponents - and colleagues - in @entity17 , where more than a third of @entity19 went to a private school			1
@entity21 has been accused of packing his government with a privately - educated elite , including several @entity24			2
@entity2 last week launched an ad campaign portraying the @entity26 as out - of - touch @entity26 sitting around the @entity28 table , mocking the poor and disabled and mr @entity1 made the comments as he dismissed the ‘ smug ’ claims from a leading private schools boss that state schools turn out ‘ amoral ’ children because teachers are too focussed on passing exams			1
writing for @entity38 , mr @entity1 said ‘ frazzled headteachers and bureaucracy - laden teachers ’ have not forgotten nurturing well - rounded pupils is just as important as qualifications			1
@entity44 , chair of the @entity45 , suggested many state school pupils end up with no sense of right and wrong			1
mr @entity44 claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a ‘ moral compass ’ because teachers are concentrating on delivering better academic results			1
but mr @entity1 hit back : ‘ personally , amongst the singularly most immoral people i have met have been those taught within some of @entity57 ’s leading public schools			1
’ around 7 per cent of people in the @entity59 went to a private school but in @entity17 the figure is much higher			1
a study in 2010 showed that 54 per cent of @entity26 mps went to a fee paying school , compared with 40 per cent of @entity66			0
among @entity19 the figure was only 15 per cent , but this includes shadow chancellor @entity68 , who went to @entity69 , shadow business secretary @entity70 , who went to @entity72 in @entity73 and deputy leader @entity74 , who attended @entity75 ’ school			1
mr @entity1 attended @entity76 in @entity77 , north west @entity78 before studying history at @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity82			2
@entity76 charges fees of £ 5,720 a term - a total of £ 17,160 per year			0
he was a popular author and presenter of history programmes before being elected as mp for @entity88 on @entity89 in 2010			0
in his article mr @entity1 said : ‘ young people leaving state schools are quite obviously not amoral			1
neither have frazzled headteachers and bureaucracy - laden teachers forgotten that the nurture of purposeful , well - rounded citizens is as important a part of schooling as the development of successful learners			2
‘ but there is now a growing awareness that if we choose to focus on exam results , league tables and narrow attainment to the detriment of inculcating attributes of character , grit and resilience , then we are not striking the balance our young people need if they are to thrive in the modern world			0
’ @entity44 claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a ' moral compass ' because teachers are concentrating on delivering better academic results ( file picture ) however , he suggested that in a ‘ peculiar , ham - fisted way ’ mr @entity44 may have ‘ had a point ’ about the need to recognise that ‘ courage , compassion , honesty , integrity , fairness , perseverance , emotional intelligence … are public goods in and of themselves , not just because they are highly prized by modern labour markets ’			1
in a speech this week , mr @entity44 claimed that too many state school staff operated in ‘ a climate of fear ’ which meant they failed to provide children with an enriching education , he added			1
education secretary @entity140 dismissed claims state schools are ' amoral ' as nonsense fee - paying schools devote more time to extra-curricular activities , a broad curriculum and personal , social , health and economic development – meaning their students were able to ‘ distinguish the good from the bad and the true from the false ’			1
mr @entity44 , head of £ 6,867 - a - year @entity150 in @entity151 , which caters for two to 11 - year - olds , made his provocative claims in a keynote speech to fellow heads at his association ’s annual conference in @entity158			1
‘ schools are turning out too many amoral children because teachers can not find the time to teach the difference between right and wrong , ’ he said			1
‘ it seems that the only results that matter are those which have created added value in terms of raising a pupil ’s statistical level from one stage to the next , and parents are increasingly buying in to this notion			0
’ the remarks have also been criticised by @entity26 education secretary @entity140			1
he said : ‘ this is nonsense			0
state schools are getting better in every respect – from delivering a more rigorous education to ensuring children leave school with the right values			1
‘ only a few weeks ago , the head of the independent @entity183 in @entity184 admitted state schools are improving so fast they are increasingly becoming a threat to private schools			1
‘ when i visit a school which gets great academic results it is always the case that everything else about the school is also brilliant ; the sport , the community involvement , the best drama			0
wasting talent , by telling millions of pupils that academic success is not for them , would be truly amoral			2
’ @entity1 argues that schools should appreciate attributes such as honesty , integrity and fairness as public goods in themselves @entity44 , chairman of the @entity45 , has smugly and ineptly accused state schools of failing to provide pupils with a ‘ moral compass			1
’ personally , amongst the singularly most immoral people i have met have been those taught within some of @entity57 ’s leading public schools			0
and most of today ’s public school would do better to spend their time reflecting on whether their institutions are living up to their founding principles of providing alms and education to local poor children			1
as @entity220 ’s chief inspector sir @entity219 has regularly pointed out , that should be the starting point before independent school heads start prescribing solutions for the state sector yet buried within @entity44 ’s clumsy , privileged language , lies an uncomfortable kernel of truth			1
young people leaving state schools are quite obviously not amoral			1
neither have frazzled headteachers and bureaucracy - laden teachers forgotten that the nurture of purposeful , well - rounded citizens is as important a part of schooling as the development of successful learners			2
but there is now a growing awareness that if we choose to focus on exam results , league tables and narrow attainment to the detriment of inculcating attributes of character , grit and resilience , then we are not striking the balance our young people need if they are to thrive in the modern world			0
for a start there is the rising tide of mental illness in young people			0
meanwhile , technology and social media appear to be making it more difficult to concentrate for long periods at a time			0
@entity266 , by academics such as professor @entity264 at @entity265 , has provided a persuasive argument that ‘ the flow of novelty ’ in contemporary society is so strong that higher levels of commitment , discipline and self - control are needed to ensure that long - term wellbeing is not repeatedly sacrificed upon the altar of short - term gratification			0
then there is the economic argument			0
because whilst the economy of the future will put a high premium on vocational , academic and creative excellence , it will also demand that our young people emerge from education as confident , self - disciplined and resilient individuals			2
as many employers will testify , outstanding qualifications on their own are no guarantee of the wider aptitudes required by the world of work			0
so , it is not overly fanciful to suggest that a re-emphasis on the cultivation of character within our schools – what @entity44 describes as a ‘ respect for discipline , sport and culture , service , and personal responsibility ’ - might help boost our global economic competitiveness			1
yet we should not need to rest the argument for these ancient education ideals on utilitarian premises			0
for it is remarkable that just as contemporary moral philosophy has begun to throw off its legalistic shackles and , following @entity315 , re-examine what it means for human beings to live well and flourish , social and political discourse has become far more constrained			0
courage , compassion , honesty , integrity , fairness , perseverance , emotional intelligence - we should want such attributes for our young people because they are public goods in and of themselves , not just because they are highly prized by modern labour markets			0
from the @entity336 , @entity331 and @entity332 , to @entity333 , @entity334 and the @entity335 , for 2000 years schooling has been primarily concerned with the formation of character			0
but their moral enterprise was always about pursuing this greater good - schools , after all , are profoundly social environments			2
‘ the noblest heraldry of @entity345 , ’ as @entity334 called it – ‘ that which forms the conscience of society , and creates and forms its best motive power			0
’ or as @entity350 wrote , schools should be seen “ not as mere machines for teaching , reading , writing and arithmetic , but as a living whole with complex functions , religious , moral and intellectual "			2
modern society is far from amoral - if anything we are fed a daily diet of moral panic by a hyper - sensitive , morally - reactive media			2
however , there can be little argument that the sense of social mission which emerged from the pursuit of character in education has diminished			0
i do n’t blame teachers or school - leaders for that			2
nor do i blame politicians			0
we all want information about achievement ; we all want transparency in our public services ; and we know that regular and effective analysis of data can help identify struggling schools and pin - point falling attainment			2
but the argument is growing for greater balance in the system			0
because there is no doubt that the supportive , dedicated and ambitious communities provided by the best schools is vital to challenging that decline			0
but we must allow them the freedom to do just that			0
in a peculiar , ham - fisted way i suspect that was the argument @entity44 was trying to make			2
and if so , depressingly , he had a point .			0

@entity44 claimed state schools create amoral children
