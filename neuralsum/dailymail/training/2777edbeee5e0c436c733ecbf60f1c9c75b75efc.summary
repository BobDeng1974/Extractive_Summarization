you may not like it			2
but you ca n’t ignore it			2
part of the bundle you buy when you sit down in front of the box for some @entity8 football is the sideline show provided by the bosses for our entertainment			2
some of the gaffers do much of their best work post-match in front of that logo wallpaper			2
look nice in the kitchen , that			0
@entity20 is often given to scrunching up his face in an attempt not to savage the officials			0
but the best he can usually manage is to tell us the various reasons he ’d like to , but wo n’t			0
@entity27 and @entity28 embrace in the dug - outs at the final whistle as the two old friends went head - to - head at @entity33 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity34 and @entity35 drew 1 - 1 @entity27 worked as @entity37 's assistant at @entity38 between 1997 and 2000 while he now has @entity39 back there for company , too			1
the @entity44 manager ’s hair may not budge , but he just ca n’t stop that tongue from wagging			0
there are then those other managers who are quite happy to use the touchline to put on a show			0
@entity50 has been a leading candidate there , but has been polishing up his act a bit of recent times			0
but i bet he comes back all singing , all dancing			0
and grumpy old stagers @entity60 and @entity61 have been so animated of reason seasons , they have quite the @entity64 act going on			0
but leader of the pack in all areas is of course @entity27			1
and on sunday afternoon we got to see quite what performance he ’d come up with against an old friend , then foe , @entity28			1
the @entity75 cameras captured an embrace between @entity27 and @entity37 in the tunnel pre-match the pair have been friends for many years and @entity27 encouraged @entity37 to come to the @entity8 @entity75 hoped they ’d be on to a winner with this one and opened their @entity83 coverage at lunchtime from an @entity33 dug out to set up what was to come later in the afternoon			1
complete with opening credits bearing the music from @entity89 ’s @entity88			0
although i ’m sure no one expected this to be a @entity93 confrontation			0
there was also a nice short film featuring the two masters at work with the media over the years			1
just enough to suggest that although it has all been something of a love - in in the past and during the build up to sunday ’s game , there was still just the chance that something was gon na give			2
well , that ultimately did n’t happen but nevertheless there was still much fun to be had watching these these two old pals keep it together as their teams went at it on the pitch			0
@entity115 was going to be the man in the middle for this and pre-match @entity75 wisely kept the cameras rolling to provide a very real moment			1
@entity115 was half way through interviewing the visiting gaffer when @entity27 looked up and gave a smile and a wave to someone over @entity115 ’s shoulder			1
turned out it was @entity37			1
their reunion was the centre of attention off the field at @entity33 as the heavyweights went head - to - head @entity35 veteran @entity136 headed his team into a second - half lead from a corner @entity140 snatched a point for @entity34 in the third minute of stoppage time as was revealed when the interview finished and the camera swung around to capture the two friends hugging out a big hello			1
it then carried on filming and went straight into the chat with the @entity34 boss who told us his old colleague was ‘ special			0
there you are - special ’			2
not exactly @entity154 , eh ? come game time , there was even time for the camera to follow @entity27 into the @entity34 dug out for yet more friendly grappling			1
then the two men finally took up their more familiar roles - @entity27 commanding his technical area , and @entity163 sat firmly in amongst his coaching staff			1
which is how the next 90 minutes or so played out			0
but for that added bit of drama , it is always handy that @entity27 does stand centre stage			1
because it provided us with a brilliant @entity27 - eye view of the @entity34 equalizer			1
complete with the @entity35 manager ’s slumped shoulders of resignation and what appeared to be a short , but to the point piece of unprintable @entity179			0
@entity27 was very animated on the touchline all afternoon , issuing frantic instructions to his players @entity37 , by contrast , remained in the dug - out alongside his coaching staff yet even this late disappointment could n't shake the special one out of his bonhomie for the day out at his mate ’s place			1
he told us he was ‘ yes , happy			0
and even his attempt to give referee @entity191 what for - ‘ if i speak of the second yellow i have to start in the first half ’ - petered out into the verbal equivalent of a mild finger wag			2
we even got a decent chortle out of @entity37			1
‘ we could have win ’ - his ‘ wins ’ and ‘ wons ’ get a bit mixed up - before chuckling ‘ but i say that every game ’			2
so all in all , it was very much honours even all around			2
with @entity206 card lists remaining firmly intact			0
except for poor old @entity207			0
@entity35 defender @entity207 was sent off late on and @entity34 scored from the resulting free - kick @entity115 had once famously announced to him on interview he ’d be missing the champion ’s @entity210			1
this time , @entity207 was having his early bath when @entity115 once again stuck it to him			2
this happened when he informed goalscorer @entity140 the red carded @entity35 right - back ‘ would have picked @entity215 ’ in the build up to the goal			1
‘ is that so ? ’ , smiled the @entity220			0
‘ makes it even better for us ’			0

@entity28 and @entity27 were *re-united* at @entity33
@entity27 worked as @entity37 's assistant at @entity38 for three years
it was honours even between master and *apprentice* in 1 - 1 draw
@entity75 cameras captured a warm embrace in the tunnel pre-match
@entity27 went up to the home dug - out before kick - off and at the end
@entity140 's stoppage time goal cancelled out @entity136 strike
