by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 coat slung stylishly over her shoulders and wearing a short cream dress , @entity2 slipped almost unnoticed into @entity8 ’s official @entity7 dinner in the team ’s quiet coastal retreat of @entity11 at the weekend			1
this is the woman who has put the smile back on @entity16 ’s face			1
whatever the result against @entity19 in @entity20 on saturday , the @entity8 coach will have no problem putting it into perspective			1
because for @entity16 , @entity7 disappointment would pale into insignificance compared with the heartache of losing @entity26 , his beloved wife of 25 years , to cancer in november 2007			1
heartbreak : @entity16 lost his wife @entity26 to cancer in 2007			1
the two met when he was 18			2
progressive : the @entity33 coach has got his team playing more progressive football than @entity36 managed the 56 - year - old father of two has since found love again with @entity2			1
the couple live together in @entity40 and the 42 - year - old @entity2 is regularly seen at @entity8 ’s games			1
‘ the main objective for a man is happiness , ’ says @entity16			1
‘ i told my children ( @entity46 and @entity47 ) that with @entity49 ’s presence they have n’t lost a father but they have gained a person who is richer again			0
' i have met someone who has filled me with the desire to try the joys of love again — and without love i can not live			0
’ the people of @entity8 mourned with @entity16 after @entity26 ’s early death , and there is a wave of support for him to succeed in @entity63			1
the couple first met when an 18 - year - old @entity16 was coming home from playing in a @entity67 game with @entity68 and dropped into a cafe in his hometown of @entity71 near @entity72 for a hot chocolate			2
‘ we never left each other ’s side from then on , ’ he recalls			0
‘ we got married in 1982 and in 30 years we only fought once , over a tennis racket if i remember correctly			0
she taught me everything i know about life			2
’ @entity81 : @entity16 's humility and dignity has endeared him to the @entity33 public results : @entity16 led @entity8 to the final of @entity87 before their eventual defeat to @entity89 with @entity26 at his side , @entity16 moved to @entity91 and then @entity92 where he played in the same team as @entity94			1
later , as a coach , he worked his way up at @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 before getting his big opportunity at @entity102 in 2004			1
however , @entity16 stepped down just six weeks into the job when his wife ’s breast cancer , first diagnosed several years earlier , became more aggressive			1
‘ her life was my life , ’ he says			2
‘ i told her that when the treatment got really invasive i would be by her side every minute , so i went back to @entity71			0
' people were surprised by my decision to leave @entity102 but to me it was natural			2
’ a year later , @entity16 returned to work and took over at @entity113 , transforming the club into a @entity116 team , but @entity26 ’s health was failing fast			1
‘ in those last hours , me and my children lay in bed beside her , ’ he recalls			0
‘ we gave her hugs and kept talking to her			0
the doctors told us the last thing terminally - ill people lose is their hearing			0
' they usually recognise their family ’s voices			0
i will always carry her last words inside me but can not repeat them			0
’ discipline : the coach has brought the best out of the likes of @entity135 by insisting he modifies his behaviour the dignified way that @entity16 conducted himself , combined with his growing reputation as a top coach , made him a popular choice to replace @entity141 after @entity8 ’s disastrous performance at the @entity143			1
he guided his country to the final of @entity87 , modifying a traditionally rigid style in favour of a more positive approach with players encouraged to be more creative			0
‘ @entity16 is a very good guy and a clever coach , ’ @entity151 boss @entity150 told @entity152			1
‘ he came to meet me in @entity155 to talk about possible selections for @entity8 ’s squad			2
' he knows his players well			0
they play good attacking football under him but also keep to the @entity33 roots of a strong defence			1
’ a man whose quiet lifestyle has earned him the nickname @entity164 , @entity165 , has introduced a strict code of ethics , refusing to pick players like @entity135 , @entity169 and @entity170 when they were suspended for their clubs			0
he has also urged his players to be more humble towards their fans and invited a local priest to attend @entity8 ’s @entity7 training camp at their @entity176 headquarters near @entity40 last month			2
the four - time world champions might welcome some divine intervention after failing to win any of their last seven internationals			0
ever composed and dapper , @entity16 does not seem unduly concerned			2
‘ history shows us that we have been able to overcome difficulties , ’ he says			0
after all , he has overcome far worse .			0
