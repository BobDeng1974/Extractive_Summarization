a children 's @entity1 poster showing a hooded executioner holding a severed head has been labeled ' shockingly bad taste ' by furious parents in the wake of the beheading of @entity10 hostages by @entity12 jihadists			1
the posters , advertising the ' @entity15 ' tour , feature a big picture of an executioner holding an axe and a bloody head , and have been put up around the cities of @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23			1
but parents are concerned the promotional pictures hold chilling similarities to the beheadings of @entity29 and @entity30 hostages by @entity32 militants			1
a children 's @entity1 poster showing a hooded executioner holding a severed head has been labeled ' shockingly bad taste ' by furious parents in the wake of the @entity12 beheadings concerned parents have also pointed out that the executioner is masked and dressed in black in a similar way to the @entity12 masked killer , known as ' @entity44			1
' the picture is accompanied by a speech bubble from the executioner saying : ' you 'll laugh your head off			1
' father - of - two @entity51 , 45 , from @entity22 , said : ' the posters are shocking in light of the recent events in the news and in really bad taste			2
' the pictures are meant to be showing events in history , but sadly beheadings are still going on and are all too real			0
' i ca n't understand why they have n't changed the posters as there are so many other images they could have used			0
' the posters , for the latest tour of @entity15 , feature a big picture of an executioner holding an axe and a bloody head , and have been put up around the cities of @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 the show is on at @entity22 's @entity76 later this month and is currently being advertised another resident , @entity77 , 41 , added : ' i did a double take when i saw the poster			1
i could n't believe anyone would be so insensitive			0
' the posters are up all around the town so it 's hard to avoid them			0
' the @entity15 show , which is based on the popular series of @entity88 books by @entity89 , is on tour until december			0
it starts a new leg at @entity93 in @entity22 and describes itself as ' the horrible history of @entity15 with the nasty bits left in			2
' @entity96 , director and producer of the show , said he was aware of a couple of complaints and had provided alternative posters to venues			1
concerned parents have also pointed out that the executioner , also featured on the show 's website ( pictured ) , is masked and dressed in black in a similar way to the @entity12 masked killer , known as ' @entity44 ' he said : ' it is unfortunate and we are sympathetic to anyone who is offended by the poster , but it was designed in july 2013 , a long time before these recent incidents came to attention			2
' if we had designed the poster after the incidents we obviously would n't have gone ahead with it			0
' all the venues had between 200 to 800 posters and between 20,000 and 50,000 leaflets given to them last year which many started distributing in january , so from a practical point of view it is very hard to do anything			0
' in light of what has happened we have given an alternative image to the theatres for them to use for social media or advertising campaigns if they wish , but i know some places felt it could be confusing to have two different posters for the same show			0
