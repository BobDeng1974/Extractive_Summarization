@entity2 , 63 , disappeared while competing in the gruelling @entity5 on april 28 , 2012			1
but race officials only realised he had failed to finish the race when mr @entity2 ’s wife @entity15 , who was waiting for him at a guest house in @entity17 , alerted them			1
an inquest at @entity20 heard a total of 133 runners entered the 9.5 mile race but a mix - up meant organisers assumed only 132 runners had taken part			1
by the time rescue crews began searching the mountainside weather conditions were too bad and his body was found the next morning			1
despite falling down the mountainside , mr @entity2 suffered no broken bones but died from exposure after landing in a freezing puddle			1
@entity37 deputy coroner @entity36 said : ' the post-mortem was clear in stating a number of cuts , bruises and abrasions to his body which indicated injuries from sliding rather than a fall			0
' there were no broken bones			0
it may be that he was unconscious which explains why he did not attempt to get out of the pool of water			0
' the inquest heard mr @entity2 - a member of @entity52 - had set off wearing a thermal top and also had a whistle and a compass			1
three runners abandoned the arduous mountain run , including one early withdrawal			2
delay : a search party was n't launched for mr @entity2 until his wife alerted race organisers that he had n't returned to their hotel in @entity64 in the @entity6 ( stock image pictured ) race organiser @entity66 told the inquest he used his radio to tell marshals about the early withdrawal and then asked a spectator to relay the message to volunteer marshals at the fifth and final checkpoint			1
he then went to the finishing line before heading off to organise the prize - giving while participants still crossed the line			2
mr @entity66 said : ' with hindsight i think that with one dropping out so early the figure of 132 has stuck with some people			2
' mrs @entity84 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , attended the inquest with the couple ’s children @entity88 and @entity91			0
she said her husband had started running about 15 years ago			0
she said : ' he always did it as a hobby and was n’t one of the elite racers			0
the last time i saw him was about 11.40am when he went off to the race			2
i usually expected him back after about four hours but he never returned			0
