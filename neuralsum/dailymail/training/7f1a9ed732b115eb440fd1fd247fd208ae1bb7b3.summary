almost 35 years have passed since i tried to exchange sterling for roubles at the reception desk of a @entity5 hotel			0
it was a modest sum , about £ 30 , but the receptionist became agitated			0
‘ do n’t change here ! ’ she whispered			1
‘ we pay only the official rate			2
’ ‘ where , then ? ’ i asked			1
she pointed across the lobby at a figure in a sombre green jacket , with stiff - brimmed cap and face blank as an empty soup plate			2
‘ @entity18 ! ’ she said			1
‘ he pays six times the rate			2
’ she reached for my notes , and hurried across to the militia man			2
they held a brief conversation , the transaction was made , and she returned , smiling			0
‘ he asked me where you are from , and i told him @entity28 , ’ she said			1
‘ he said he likes @entity28 , so he gave me seven times			2
’ @entity32 president @entity31 announces @entity33 as the hosts for the @entity35 in december 2010 @entity31 ( right ) hands the @entity35 to @entity33 ’s sheik @entity36 she picked out her own , modest , commission , and handed me a bundle of roubles			1
it was all perfectly open ; nobody reacted , nobody seemed to care			0
that was the way life was lived in @entity47			0
i repeated the performance three or four times over the period of the @entity51			0
the man would nod to me as i walked through the foyer ; occasionally he would pat the wallet in his inside pocket			0
i told myself that , while illegal , it was harmless , a victimless crime which everybody committed			0
it was several weeks later , when the @entity60 were over and i was back home , that the doubts started to crowd in			0
of course @entity65 society was hopelessly corrupt from top to bottom			2
but through my complicity in that tacky deception , had n’t i helped to make it a little more squalid ? which brings us , quite naturally , to @entity74 ’s hapless bid to stage the 2018 @entity35			1
in this column on december 5 , 2010 - three days after the humiliating vote - i related details of a private dinner party i had attended in a @entity80 hotel			2
the dinner had taken place 11 months earlier , and guests included senior civil servants , three or four journalists , and leading members of the @entity74 world cup 2018 bid team			1
@entity88 shakes hands with @entity31 and hands over @entity74 's ill - fated @entity35 2018 bid book after the meal , the bid ’s chief executive , @entity92 , was asked about rumours of corruption among the @entity32 executive committee who would choose the host nation			1
to general amazement , he told us that the matter had been given a great deal of thought , and he and his team had concluded that , of the 24 voting members , ‘ at least 13 are buyable ’			1
it was a major faux pas , and one which @entity92 ’s underlings were swift to smother			1
retractions were made , explanations were offered , assurances of @entity32 ’s probity were uttered			1
but he had said it , he clearly meant it , and the conclusion was obvious : if 13 were ‘ buyable ’ , then presumably they would be bought			1
but bought by whom ? for how much ? and what measures had the bid team taken to obtain such damaging facts ? i remember worrying about the issue for several weeks			2
on the one hand , the dinner was a private function , with everything off the record			0
on the other , the bidding team were spinning the story that @entity74 had great expectations of success			0
@entity88 , @entity135 and @entity92 look dejected as @entity74 miss out on hosting the 2018 @entity35 media criticism was contemptuously rejected , international rascals were shamelessly embraced , squalid promises were lightly offered and about £ 21million was wastefully spent			1
and all this on a bid which 13 ‘ buyable ’ chancers had already rendered irrelevant ; a bid which they knew was doomed to fail			1
had @entity92 ’s remark been reported , then @entity32 would have erupted and @entity74 ’s bid would have been instantly withdrawn			1
and we , the dreaded media , would have suffered both the blame and the consequences			0
and so , having promised silence , i said nothing , wincing as the charade unfolded and biting my tongue as breezy , baseless forecasts were doled out to a wholly unsuspecting public			0
and it came to pass that a magnificent bid which was superior to the rest by every criterion — and immeasurably superior to the @entity65 entry — received just two votes and went out on the first ballot			2
once again , @entity92 tried to blame the media , a reaction which would have been hilarious were it not so depressing , and with the medieval emirate of @entity33 profiting through an even more outrageous fix , the movers and shakers at @entity32 celebrated a clean sweep for the bad guys			1
football 's world governing body has come under enormous scrutiny after its handling of the @entity35 vote the fact is , they feel themselves to be invulnerable			1
and after last week ’s farcical developments , who shall blame them ? the details have been well ventilated ; the former @entity185 prosecutor , @entity184 , composed a deeply damaging report on the bidding processes for 2018 and 2022			2
he had faced certain drawbacks : his inquiry could not demand the presence of witnesses , he was banned from visiting @entity47 , and many of the @entity65 by and large declined to turn up , then told him their computers had been destroyed and their emails were lost , the high - tech equivalent of ‘ the dog ate my homework ’			1
the @entity33 , similarly , lavished £ 1.15m on the @entity201 ’s conference and doled out seductive grants to developing countries through their ‘ @entity204 ’			1
@entity32 decided against publishing his 430 - page report , but instead commissioned a precis by @entity208 , the chair of the adjudicating chamber of @entity32 ’s ‘ @entity210 ’			1
his conclusion , that everything was sweetness and light with both bids , seemed to be repeatedly contradicted by much of the evidence he had published			0
even when @entity184 complained with great bitterness that his report had been wilfully misrepresented , their complacency was unshaken			0
people read the headlines , you see ; the small print does not carry the same impact			0
so , it ’s trebles all round and a whitewash well done			0
for the truth is , they believe they can get away with it			0
and history tells us they are probably right			0
@entity184 ( left ) and @entity208 pictured together in 2012 at @entity32 headquarters in @entity239 the @entity241 chairman , @entity240 , called it ‘ a bit of a joke ’ , which was an understatement , but he also said something of real importance : ‘ the whole of the way football operates at that sort of level is suspect , and has been for many years			1
i do n’t think @entity32 are a straight organisation and have n’t been for many years			1
’ think about that : the man who leads the oldest football association in the world believes that the world governing body are not straight ; in other words , they are crooked , and they have been for years			2
is that not a desperately serious allegation ? @entity32 are corrupt , indefensible , unfit for purpose ; yet they expect to sail serenely on , led by their dubious , 78 - year - old president @entity31 , who has an outrageous ambition to serve his fifth five - year term			1
they appear to be banking on the notion that nobody really cares , that things will always be this way , that wholesale , deep - rooted corruption is a way of life			0
@entity47 , a rather more substantial monolith , harboured a similar delusion			0
yet scarcely a decade later it was gone , buried beneath the debris of its own moral anarchy			0
there may be a lesson there , if @entity31 and his cronies care to learn it			2
@entity241 chairman @entity240 appeared on @entity285 on thursday to discuss the @entity32 report into corruption @entity288 the legalised loan sharks known as @entity290 have graciously announced that they are to remove their logo from @entity293 ’s replica shirts and training kit for children , up to the age of 13			1
the move is the brainwave of @entity290 ’s new chairman , one @entity299 , who apparently wants to ensure that the young ones are not persuaded to rush out and snap up loans at an extortionate rate of interest			0
there is a word to describe this latest gimmick , but our lawyer refuses to let me use it			0
so we must settle for ‘ disingenuous ’			2
@entity293 sponsors @entity290 have announced that they will remove their logo from children 's replica shirts			0

@entity32 are corrupt , indefensible and unfit for purpose
@entity31 sails on with an ambition to serve his fifth five - year term
