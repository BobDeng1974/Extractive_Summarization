@entity1 's long - standing fixation with impossibly white teeth is leading some to develop what dentists refer to as ' bleachorexia			2
' according to @entity8 - based cosmetic dentist @entity7 , over-bleaching is an all too common practice ; one that causes severe and permanent damage by stripping tooth enamel and causing gums to recede			1
' once the enamel has been chemically eroded away , then it ’s gone , it ’s gone forever , ' mr @entity7 , who has even encountered people rubbing @entity14 on their teeth in a desperate bid for a megawatt smile , tells @entity20			1
' he said my teeth could basically turn to mush just because i was destroying the enamel , ' she reports			1
@entity40 peroxide , the bleaching agent used in most whitening treatments , can make the teeth brittle and chalky , leading to hypersensitivity			1
according to a recent survey conducted by the @entity46 of @entity47 , 96per cent of adults believes a good smile can make a person more attractive , and 74per cent consider a bad one to be a career disadvantage			0
all those questioned said that if they could improve one thing about their smile , it would be whiter teeth			0
which is probably why @entity1 spend $ 1.4 billion annually on tooth whitening products , a 300per cent rise since 1996 , and why many are ignoring product guidelines and bleaching their teeth more frequently than is recommended			1
way back when : countless @entity67 stars over the years have refused to settle for their natural tooth shades , including @entity69 ( left ) in 1998 , @entity70 ( center ) in 2005 , and @entity72 ( right ) in 2000 do n't be fooled ! these stars may now sport blindingly - white nashers ( all pictured in 2014 ) , but this is most likely down to porcelain veneers rather than @entity76 so how do you know if you 're overdoing it with the carbamide peroxide ? spoiler - if you are exceeding the number of regular treatments advised by your dentist , or with your at - home - whitening products , you probably are			1
the main warning signs are excessive sensitivity , gum irritation and translucent blotches appearing on the teeth , @entity85 , @entity86 , a professor in the @entity87 at the @entity88 , writes for @entity94			0
' some people 's teeth get more transparent if you continue whitening , ' he states			0
' you can see right through them and see the dark shadows of your mouth			0
' cautionary tale : in one of tv show friends ' most memorable episodes , @entity102 leaves on his at - home whitening treatment for too long and ends up in quite the predicament it should also be remembered that depending on your teeth 's natural shade , brightening them up to white - as - snow levels is actually near - impossible , no matter how much you frazzle them with bleach			0
most of the megawatt smiles we see paraded by celebrities from @entity121 and @entity70 to @entity122 and @entity72 are the results of porcelain veneers , not bleach			0
veneers are thin shells of medical - grade ceramic that are attached to the front surfaces of teeth , and will set you back anywhere from $ 800 to $ 2,500 per tooth			1
@entity135 - based cosmetic dentist dr @entity134 , who is thought to have first coined the term ' bleachorexic ' in 2005 , assures , however , that with caution and realistic expectations , getting your teeth a few shades lighter can be pretty risk - free			2
' bleaching is very effective in moderation , and it 's safe in moderation , ' she told @entity147 last year			0
' it 's when you 're bleaching all the time , beyond what is recommended , that 's when you run into problems			2

bleaching your teeth more often than is recommended can erode tooth enamel permanently
it can also lead to receding gums and painful hypersensitivity
