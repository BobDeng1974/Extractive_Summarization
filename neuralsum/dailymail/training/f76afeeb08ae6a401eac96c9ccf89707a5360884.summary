from single colour eating to the ' drip diet ' and wheatgrass shots , bizarre slimming crazes are par for the course in @entity5			0
but there 's a new fat - buster on the block , and this time , there are no oddball eating habits in sight			2
the new @entity13 diet aid of choice is the green coffee pill , which is believed to help suppress the appetite as well as encouraging fat burning			1
slender : the petite @entity19 is rumoured to be using green coffee bean pills to control her weight already believed to be using the pills are @entity19 , @entity23 and @entity24 , while the rest of the @entity27 glitterati are set to follow suit the pill , sold under the trade name @entity31 in the @entity32 , is made from unripe coffee bean extract , and contains no caffeine - unlike green tea			1
instead , the beans contain chlorogenic acids , including one that happens to be a potent natural fat - buster called 5 - caffeoylquinic acid			1
' my clients have been going crazy for green coffee bean pills , ' a well - respected @entity5 nutritionist revealed in an interview with @entity46 magazine			1
' they 're taking @entity5 by storm			0
in the run - up to the @entity50 , actresses do almost anything to look as slender as possible and they 're all fighting it out to have the best body on the red carpet			2
' as soon as this pill got a name for itself as being the new miracle weight loss tablet , word spread like wildfire among the @entity5 elite			0
' you 're supposed to take 800mg a day but some are taking 1,600mg and insisting " it ca n't do any harm "			0
' competitive : according to one nutritionist , awards season pressure to be the slimmest is behind the rise of green coffee bean pills among @entity5 actresses @entity5 trend : pills made from green coffee beans are believed to be popular among @entity5 slimmers inexpensive : the green coffee bean pills cost just £ 14.95 from @entity32 supplier , @entity77 although taking double the correct dose is n't recommended , there is some evidence to support green coffee 's fat - busting reputation			1
a study conducted by scientists from the @entity85 in @entity86 found that taking the pills can help boost weight - loss by an impressive 10 per cent - even when taken in relatively low doses			1
@entity90 , who led the study , said : ' based on our results , taking multiple capsules of green coffee extract a day — while eating a low - fat , healthful diet and exercising regularly — appears to be a safe , effective , inexpensive way to lose weight			1

' you can buy them cheaply online but who knows what 's in them ? i 've heard that lots of them have fillers added to bulk them out			0
banned in the @entity32 , ephedrine is a substance that acts similarly to cocaine when ingested , leaving the user with a racing pulse and making them hyperactive , while also suppressing the appetite			0
