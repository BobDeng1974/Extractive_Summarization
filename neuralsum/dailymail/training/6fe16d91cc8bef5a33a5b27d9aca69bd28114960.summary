a deaf quadriplegic blogger who won the hearts of thousands with touching internet posts before his sister announced he had died from pneumonia has been exposed as a fraud			1
' @entity6 ' , a 24 - year - old cerebral palsy sufferer , garnered legions of fans with his witty tweets and @entity12 posts , which he said he typed using a @entity14 computer that tracked his eye movement using infrared light			1
after his story gained national coverage , @entity17 ' revealed online on october 11 that he had passed away , leading to an outpouring of grief and sympathy from across the internet			0
but now a fellow blogger , who carried out web investigations after becoming suspicious of @entity26 , has exposed him as a fake , revealing just how he spun an intricate web of lies that fooled so many			1
lies : a deaf paraplegic blogger named @entity6 has been revealed as a fake after a fellow blogger grew suspicious of his claims			1
' @entity26 ' had used this picture on social networking sites @entity37 : the picture is actually of a man named @entity39 and has appeared in news reports , pictured after learning of @entity26 's death and his ' last blog post ' , published by his sister on friday , blogger @entity41 began to question the story			1
writing a post exposing the fraud , she asked how a paraplegic who could only type four words a minute could keep in such swift and consistent contact with followers online			1
she also wondered how life must be for someone who was deaf and unable to sign as a result of his cerebral palsy - yet also noted how he described his friends and relationships with such detail			0
she then found that the photo @entity26 had been using was actually of @entity39 , another young man with cerebral palsy , whose picture appears on the @entity14 site			1
@entity41 was unable to discover @entity39 's @entity12 page , and noted that it was he who deserved the real praise for being an inspiration man , rather than the fake ' @entity26 '			1
she added that most of @entity26 's tweets had been sent using @entity73 , a social media dashboard where users can view multiple messages at once and send their own			0
false : ' @entity26 ' had also uploaded this photo of him using his @entity14 computer to type messages with his eyes revealed : but the blogger also found that picture was of @entity39 from the computer 's website after sending her findings to @entity88 , who had followed @entity26 's ' inspirational ' story , they agreed it made no sense that @entity26 could be using this technology			1
' somebody using a @entity14 ocular reader would never use @entity73 , ' wrote reporter @entity96			0
' but somebody posing as @entity98 could easily use the deck			0
' @entity96 added on his own post that one of his friends , who had been in close contact with @entity26 , flew to @entity104 to attend his funeral after learning about his death			2
but @entity26 made her excuses and refused to meet the friend			1
@entity88 also discovered there was no death certificate for @entity26			1
after @entity41 published her blog post , a blogger immediately commented on it , admitting that they had carried out the hoax - and lauding its positive effects			2
yet , while identifying themselves as @entity17 , the blogger added that that person was also a character - and her pictures were of an actress from a music video			1
' no celebrity or fame was intended in this ruse ; it all came quite fast and was a total surprise , ' they wrote			2
' up until recently he only had a handful of online friends			0
the quick and furious fame is actually what brought about the end of it all			0
new persona : he wrote a blog , tweeted and posted @entity12 messages , gathering thousands of fans			1
he spoke a lot about his sister ' @entity17 ' - who he now admits is also made up ' in hindsight it probably would have been better just to shut it all down and have everyone wonder what the hell happened , but the final post was meant to have the effect it did			2
' to inspire people to love and live a better life , and the public knowledge that it came under this false pretense takes it all away			2
i hope that people who were moved by it still live by it , but it seems unlikely			2
it 's possible that more damage has been done in your reveal than in the original deception			0
' he added that he was ' just a guy with a twisted psyche who realizes he 's caused a lot of damage ' but that he would not reveal his identity as he did n't want to ruin his life			1
@entity88 added : ' we 've all been victimized by this disturbed individual			0
' it never dawned on us that somebody with such an established internet footprint would actually be mascarading as a deaf , physically handicap person			0
it would seem absurd to believe somebody would go so far as to fake a death			2
' cheated : ' @entity6 ' regularly posted tweets - both inspiring and witty - that fooled his readers the revelations come after the fraud , who claimed ' @entity6 ' lived in a residential home for disabled people in @entity190 , @entity191 , posted a ' last blog post ' on friday			1
' you are all special			0
all of you unique ! ' it read			0
' love each other and make each other smile			0
a good joke is good medicine ! make sure everyone around you have a smile ok ? ' always do what is right			0
always ! but forgive yourself if you forget sometimes			0
i have to go now			0
i will never forget you ! " maintaining the ruse of deafness , he added : ' @entity209 want to ask if there is sound in heaven			2
i guess there is but not sure if i want it ! fans : @entity216 users sent kind messages to ' @entity98 ' as they were deceived into thinking he was real reality : the blogger , who has not been identified , stole the pictures of a man named @entity39 ( front ) ' here on earth i been happy to be deaf and nobody seem to be very good at describe what is sound , so i have not miss it			1
but i guess if that part of the deal then i have to take what i get ! ' upon learning of @entity6 's death saddened followers of his social media postings wrote heartfelt tributes to him			1
' @entity98 and thank you so much for just being you brother , ' commented on @entity216 user under the handle @ @entity239			0
' in honor of @entity6 , am going to follow his advice and reach out to someone i have n't in awhile , ' wrote @ juanmagdaraog			1
many others posted messages with the words ' rip ' and ' goodnight ' , while the @entity250 's editor @entity249 wrote : ' we lost a good man today			0
@ daveonwheels you inspired a lot of people and your incredible personality will live on forever			2
