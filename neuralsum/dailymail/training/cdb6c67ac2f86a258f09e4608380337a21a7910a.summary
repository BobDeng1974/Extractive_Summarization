mrs @entity9 now says she has been ' unfairly punished ' for being a ' good parent '			2
she said : ' the way i have been punished for protecting my own child is appalling			0
' however the tagged curfew does n’t just punish me , it also punishes my kids because i ca n’t take them out without being worried that i must be back by 7pm			0
' i do n’t know why they are punishing me for raising the issue of bullying			0
by punishing me they have solved nothing			0
i did the right thing by protecting my son			2
' it was not that i did not know where he was or that he was going out committing crime			0
traumatic : @entity57 school in @entity16 , where @entity10 was a pupil before his mother withdrew him after he endured bullying @entity60 : @entity9 claims her son was repeatedly bullied while he attended school , and was attacked on four different occasions ( file picture posed by models ) ' i should not have been punished for being a good mother			1
' mrs @entity9 repeatedly took @entity10 out of @entity69 where she had claimed he was subjected to a catalogue of physical and verbal attacks			1
in may , @entity72 told a court that over 15 months @entity10 was attacked four times - once so badly he was left in hospital and on another occasion so badly that the school ’s police officer was called in			1
he was also sent threatening text messages , which included racial abuse against @entity81			0
at the time @entity69 ’s head teacher @entity83 acknowledged there had been issues with @entity10 but that strenuous efforts had been made to work with his family to both resolve those issues and his poor attendance			2
since june 11 @entity10 has been at @entity90 in @entity91 where she says he has had no problems with bullies and has a 100 per cent attendance record			2
treatment : mrs @entity9 said that @entity10 was taken to hospital after bullies stamped on his chest in an attack at @entity100 in @entity16 at the case earlier this year , @entity101 heard that mrs @entity9 had repeatedly failed to ensure @entity10 went to school , and that he only attended on 42 out of 224 occasions between october 13 , 2010 and december 9 , 2011			1
prosecuting , @entity105 told the court stringent measures were in place to prevent further bullying			0

defending , @entity115 said @entity10 was removed from the school in october 2010 after his chest was stamped on , leaving him in hospital			1
in april 2011 he was removed for six months when his mother found him cowering in an alleyway in tears after he was attacked by bullies at @entity100			1
punishment : an electronic police tag similar to the one mrs day has had to wear for keeping her bullied son from school mrs @entity9 was warned in december about his attendance , so sent him back to school in january , but took him out again after he was beaten up twice in just a week			1

@entity72 said she now hopes to set up a group where other parents who feel they have been wrongly punished by the courts over truancy can share their experiences			0
she said : ' i have a conviction for protecting my child and i am sure i ’m not the only one			0
' i am sure many parents are punished for doing exactly the same thing and trying to ensure their child is safe and gets a decent education			0
' there are thousands of children who are still not attending school so how are these prosecutions even working ? ' people who are being bullied are told not to suffer in silence but when i decided to do something about it i found myself facing a prison sentence and now have a conviction			2
' i think the council prosecute and pat themselves on the back instead of actually addressing the underlying problems			0
the law treats me and many other parents like we do n’t care about our children			0
cases should be considered on merit			0
