@entity0 vs @entity1 was a good tear - up on tuesday night , but i can not wait for the return of the @entity5 and this is a fixture that has me licking my lips			1
they may not be the heavyweights of old , slugging it out at the top of the table , but @entity12 and @entity13 are still ferocious rivals			1
here are the five key areas that will decide the contest			0
make no mistake about it , this is a big game			0
@entity19 and @entity20 vs the fragile @entity13 defence @entity13 have terrible injuries , not helped by a lack of investment in defence , while @entity12 ’s two attacking signings are in good form , especially @entity19			1
he has 12 goals for the club and has n’t required time to settle			0
@entity32 passes on his tips on unlocking the @entity13 defence to star man @entity19 the @entity12 manager talks to @entity19 during their final training session before the @entity13 showdown @entity32 and @entity19 share a joke during the friday morning training session at @entity41 @entity20 ( left ) picked up an knock vs @entity0 and @entity19 may be fatigued from @entity44 duty @entity45 may start for @entity13 at the back after injuries ruled out more experienced players @entity20 on the ball in @entity12 training as @entity51 watches on forward - thinking trio @entity53 ( left ) , @entity20 ( centre ) and @entity51 arrive for training the biggest concern is how quickly he can recover from his recent international exploits , with matches for @entity44 against @entity59 and @entity60			1
he is n’t due back at @entity12 until friday and @entity32 must decide if he is fatigued , or fit enough to try and continue his explosive form			1
if @entity20 is fit after picking up a hamstring injury on @entity1 duty , this will be a huge game for him			1
he will be motivated after being written off by @entity65 and will relish this fixture			2
i ’d still like to see him further up the pitch and finishing chances in the box , but he looks at home at @entity12			2
i wonder if he ’ll celebrate if he scores ? @entity72 vs @entity73 my training ground sources at @entity12 tell me that @entity32 sees @entity75 as a defensive midfielder eventually			1
right now , he is having to stand in at right back and was given a real chasing in @entity12 's last game against @entity79 by winger @entity80			2
he also found himself second - choice behind @entity81 with @entity1			2
@entity82 celebrates scoring for @entity13 against @entity83 in september @entity75 ( left ) struggled to contain @entity79 's @entity80 during @entity12 's 2 - 1 defeat football analysts @entity86 believe an @entity12 win is the most likely outcome against @entity13 but he ’s a young man with lots of ability and i am a huge fan			1
he comes face to face with dynamic @entity82 , who looks to be off his game at the moment			0
if he is fit – he too took a knock on international duty – he owes united a big performance , because he has been flat recently			0
after three goals and four assists in his first six games , he has only one assist in his last three			0
he has n’t been helped with the changing of his position			0
since moving out to the left wing , he has n’t contributed as much			0
he clearly wants to play through the middle			0
what system will @entity106 pick ? he ’s chopping and changing his formation at the moment and it ’s confusing his own players , more than the opposition			0
people praise a manager who changes his formation mid-game to impact on the result , but it only proves he got the formation wrong in the first place			0
@entity65 has chopped and changed @entity13 's formation lead to confusion among his players will @entity13 play with a diamond ? will it be three at the back ? or maybe 4 - 4 - 2 ? where will he play @entity72 ? @entity129 has had rotten luck with injuries , especially in the back line , and he will probably have to play with a rookie pairing at @entity12			1
his reputation is giving him breathing space			0
where will @entity51 play ( if he starts ) ? @entity51 will probably wish to play in the deep midfield position			2
he ’s done well there for @entity1 , but @entity12 have more competition for places			1
@entity51 has also played better for @entity1 this season than he has for his club			2
@entity32 does n’t seem to agree with @entity144 ’s assessment of @entity51 ’s best role , so can he force his way into the team higher up the pitch ? i agree with @entity32 ; i like to see @entity51 playing one - twos around the opposition box , but there are question marks about his energy levels			1
@entity51 reacts to a missed chance in @entity12 's friday training session before the @entity13 game @entity51 gets away from @entity158 during the practice match during friday 's training @entity51 impressed in a deeper role for @entity1 against @entity0 earlier this week @entity51 gets a helping hand from captain @entity163 , who is set to return for the @entity13 game @entity165 pings the ball during @entity12 's training session ahead of the @entity13 clash @entity169 was wrapped up warm in training on friday morning he needs a big game for @entity12 , so if he is picked , can he deliver as he did against @entity172 , when he was terrific ? @entity173 is under pressure there are growing questions being raised about @entity173			1
he no longer has the centre forward role to himself , with @entity179 and @entity180 - who is out for two weeks with a fresh injury - breathing down his neck			0
some people are too keen to withdraw @entity179 , either into midfield or behind the striker , but he showed against @entity0 that he still has much to offer up front			0
is he a better pick than @entity190 in @entity13 ’s no 9 position ? @entity173 celebrates scoring against @entity192 ( left ) but has had a mixed season @entity180 celebrates scoring for @entity13 against @entity194 in the @entity5 in october the former @entity12 striker seems to have lost some pace and is no longer the same force			1
will he celebrate if he scores against his old club ? you bet he will			0
@entity12 ’s defence is not at its best and this is a chance for him to show he still has what it takes			2
@entity205 will always score - @entity206 @entity207 will be appearing on @entity210 ’s @entity209 ’s live coverage of @entity12 v @entity13 , 5.30pm kick off			1

@entity12 host @entity13 at the @entity213 on *saturday* *afternoon*
@entity65 has injury concerns over several first - team players
@entity20 is a doubt for @entity32 with a hamstring injury
@entity82 and @entity173 need big games for @entity13
where will @entity12 play @entity51 after his @entity1 display ?
can @entity65 's *makeshift* defence hold out ?
