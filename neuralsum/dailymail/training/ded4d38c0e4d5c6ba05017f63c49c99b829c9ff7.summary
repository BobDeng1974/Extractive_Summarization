by @entity1 reporter published : 15:15 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 03:42 est , 17 march 2013 drones have become the latest must - have tools for security forces across the world , providing a watchful eye in the sky			0
but a team of engineers could extend the vehicles ' watching brief - developing a claw - like leg that would allow drones to snatch objects while in flight			2
engineers at the @entity16 in @entity17 based their design on the bald eagle , replicating the bird 's ability to clutch fish from water while in flight			1
snatch : engineers at the @entity16 in @entity17 have developed a grabbing arm that can be attached to a drone inspiration : the team based their design on the bald eagle 's ability to snatch fish from water mid-flight grabbed : an arm attached to the drone is able to lag behind the vehicle 's centre - point , like an eagle 's legs the gripping device , comprising three talon - like arms , has been tested on a tiny unmanned aerial vehicle			1
situated on the end of a attached leg , the claw can drag slightly behind the drone 's centre of mass - much like an eagle 's legs as it flies - allowing the path of flight to continue uninterrupted			1
the scientists noticed that the slight delay and detachment from the eagle 's body meant it had an extra split - second to effectively grab objects			2
at another @entity17 university software is being developed that hopes to stabilise drones with arms while in flight			2
attack : an @entity66 bald eagle flying over a river with its legs dangling below swoop : the arm allows the drone to clutch the item without stalling its flightpath tool : drones have become an increasingly popular piece of machinery for security forces across the world grip : the gripping device , comprising three talon - like arms , has been tested on a tiny unmanned aerial vehicle the team at @entity84 hope the software will allow drones to pick up objects without seriously affecting flight , by redistributing the weight			1
the software could be used to allow drones to pick up medication , use hand tools and even prune trees			0
developer @entity95 told the new scientist : ' a uav with arms could perform the same tasks as a ground robot , but with a three - dimensional workspace			0
' it will be a while before flying robots with arms and legs find their way into wider use , though			0
" we still have a long way to go to develop aircraft capable of safely interacting with people or the environment			0

engineers at @entity16 have developed armed device
based design on actions of a bald eagle and how it swoops to catch prey
attached to small unmanned aerial vehicle to clutch items in *transit*
