@entity0 saw the question coming from a hundred yards distance , and his answer was splendidly dismissive			1
‘ do we feel invincible ? ’ he echoed			0
‘ this is a joke			0
@entity6 went unbeaten in 2003 – 4			0
that will never happen again			0
’ as a young player at @entity6 during that golden season , @entity0 is eminently qualified to make the judgment			1
but @entity11 have 22 points from the 24 available			1
the question will be repeated a time or two			2
his manager , @entity15 , has been making the same response for most of october			0
and yet , after such a start , he is prepared to make cautious noises about the title			0
‘ if we were in another league , i ’d say immediately , “ yes , we will do it ”			0
in the @entity24 , we “ can ” do it			2
but it ’s hard to say we “ will ” do it			0
there ’s a long way to go			0
there ’s lots of good teams and difficult games in front of us			0
i ’m pleased , but to win the title , it ’s a long way away			0

goals : @entity88 , @entity0 51 booked : fabregas sent off : @entity74 40 referee : @entity91 ( @entity92 ) attendance : 24,451 ratings by @entity95 at @entity44 true , all true , but there is something in @entity11 ’s attitude which provokes outrageous expectations			1
it is clear that titles are not won at places like @entity44 , although @entity11 might concede that they lost last season ’s crown through defeat at @entity46			1
they might also admit that saturday 's victory could have been much more emphatic had @entity15 not insisted on restraint rather than aggression when @entity46 were there for the taking			1
finally , they might agree that their back four is suspiciously vulnerable to genuine pace , which could prove costly against more potent sides than the one they met			2
but , after making all those concessions , they will be satisfied with the three points they expected from a strangely eccentric match			0
everything is falling into place for @entity15 ’s team			0
even when they lost @entity74 to a red card on 40 minutes , @entity123 obligingly committed a second bookable offence within two minutes to restore the numerical balance			1
@entity11 then settled to unchallenged control ; good players doing the simple things to emphatic effect			2
@entity41 ’s stunning free - kick had given them the lead within six minutes , and when @entity0 drove in the second soon after the interval , their task seemed blessedly simple			1
and yet control did not yield further goals , and they endured the closing moments in a state of something akin to panic , when @entity46 substitute @entity142 created a tap - in for deserving @entity62			1
the eventful afternoon ended in traditional fashion , with the @entity46 manager , @entity145 , on the pitch , bawling at the referee and even his oen players			2
the @entity46 fans had greeted their visitors with a cheery pre-match banner which read : ‘ @entity153 ’s dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game ’			1
the tone having been set , @entity46 made a bright start , speedily deploying @entity62 and @entity63			1
but all the promise was deflated within six minutes when they conceded a free - kick 25 yards out			1
@entity41 ’s crashing strike reduced the chance to casual simplicity , the ball flying into the far top corner			1
@entity74 ( right ) was shown a straight red card for a wild challenge on @entity46 captain @entity57 @entity74 ( bottom ) made the erratic tackle in the 43rd minute that left the @entity46 captain in a heap the @entity173 international ( front ) immediately knew the severity of his challenge and apologised despite his apology @entity74 's challenge led to both set of players sharing heated exchanges @entity0 ( far right ) tries to pull away @entity46 striker @entity62 ( second right ) from the angry fracas @entity0 ' ( right ) actions only inflamed matters more as @entity62 ( centre ) and the @entity173 international came nose - to - nose when the exchanges had died down , referee @entity91 ( centre ) had no choice but to show @entity74 ( third right ) a red card @entity193 captain @entity72 ( second right ) tries to defend @entity74 to referee @entity91 but to no avail @entity46 were reduced to 10 men too just three minutes later when @entity123 ( bottom ) fouled @entity80 referee @entity91 ( second right ) produced his second red card of the match for @entity53 's tackle click here to see @entity204 's brilliant @entity203 including the move for @entity0 ' goal @entity207 miles @entity46 103.3 64.2 @entity57 90 11.2 6.9 @entity54 90 10.5 6.5 @entity62 90 10.3 6.4 @entity11 102.2 63.5 @entity0 90 11.9 7.4 @entity75 90 11.3 7.0 @entity41 90 10.5 6.5 on 28 minutes , @entity72 became the latest to be defeated by the pace of @entity62 , as he lunged hopefully and chopped him down			1
referee @entity91 surprisingly decided against even a booking			0
moments later , @entity53 was booked for a similar assault upon @entity80 , and the intensity of the match boiled over			0
the managers were inevitably involved ; @entity15 playing to the crowd with his repertoire of expansive gestures , @entity145 standing in his technical area , arms folded , white shirt clinging to paunch , bawling a stream of eye - bulging exhortations and looking like a noisy neighbour from a 1970s sit - com			2
the whole affair erupted , five minutes from half - time			1
@entity57 won a ball near halfway , and @entity74 came lunging in , out of control			1
the referee rightly produced the red card			2
@entity76 was swiftly taken off , @entity77 came on , and @entity46 were required simply to get through to the interval			2
proving that the idiocy of footballers knows no bounds , @entity53 needlessly grasped at @entity80 as the striker moved past			0
having already been carded , he was off			0
@entity46 ’s advantage had dissolved within two minutes , and @entity145 ’s rant as the referee left the pitch would have been better directed at his own absurd defender			1
@entity11 assumed assured control with the second half , their midfield dictating terms with some ease			1
and their command was reflected within six minutes when the endlessly influential @entity251 ran purposefully at a shuddering defence			2
he swapped passes with @entity78 and @entity41 before striking his scoring drive with authority			2
a feeling of inevitability settled upon the stadium			0
there may be two or three teams in @entity262 who could hope to survive after donating @entity11 a two - goal lead			1
but @entity46 are not remotely among that number			2
the only genuine surprise came with the @entity46 goal , which saw substitute @entity61 stepping nimbly along the byline to spread a perfect cross for @entity62 ’s eager acceptance			1
it was far too little , and much too late			0
they may not prove invincible , but the team which can beat them has yet to state its case			0
@entity0 doubled @entity11 's lead at @entity44 early in the second half of their @entity24 encounter on saturday @entity251 ( centre ) scored past @entity45 ( right ) after a neat move involving the @entity173 international and @entity41 @entity0 ( left ) celebrates his strike with @entity41 - after being assisted by the @entity283 international @entity62 ( left ) pulled one back for @entity46 late on , but it was n't enough against the @entity24 leaders			1

@entity11 maintained their lead at the top of the @entity24 with a @entity291 derby victory
@entity41 put the @entity193 ahead with a free - kick in the sixth minute at @entity44
@entity0 doubled @entity11 's lead early in the second half following a well - worked move
@entity62 pulled one back for @entity46 in *injury* time
@entity74 was sent off for the visitors after a wild foul on @entity46 captain @entity57 in the 40th minute
@entity123 also saw red three minutes later for a second bookable offence
