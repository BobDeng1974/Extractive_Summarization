at six weeks of age , little @entity0 , @entity1 and their sister who is yet to be named , resemble three kittens purring and napping for the majority of the day			1
but by the end of the year , @entity7 , 37 , expects his current african lion roommates to weigh up to 40 kilograms each and no longer fit on his couch			2
as the director of @entity12 in @entity13 , mr @entity7 has taken on the role of the lions ' mother from the day they were born , after their natural mother rejected them			1
' they 're only just starting to find their feet , ' mr @entity7 told @entity23			2
' @entity12 lion numbers are falling at a significant rate across the world , dropping to 26,000 from over half a million in only 100 years			1
in an effort to promote the magnificent animal 's conservation the company , which also spends a quarter of each year working in @entity42 , hopes the three cubs become their fury ambassadors and encourage @entity48 to help in their preservation			1
teaming up with @entity50 , mr @entity7 is documenting his relationship with the three cubs as they grow up			2
at only six - weeks - old , weighing no more than six kilograms each and growing at least a kilogram every day , @entity7 has personally bottle fed them from one - day - old mr @entity7 said the cubs spend up to 22 hours a day sleeping and have short bursts of energy lasting for only half an hour around their meal times before they crash ' we 've just introduced meat into their diet , so they get one meat feed a day and they get extra excited around that time , but by the time the evening news is on they 've crashed out on the lounge			1
' yeah - they have already worked out how to get on the lounge			0
they just take a little run and jump			0
' but as their weight grows by one kilogram a week , it wo n't be long before the big cats can no longer find a space on the couch			0
before their second birthdays , the two boys - named in memory of mr @entity7 's best friend @entity0 and his favourite sports player @entity85 - will weigh over 150 kilograms each			1
in their prime , at about four - years - old , each male could potentially weigh over 200 kilograms while their sister will reach about 160 kilograms			2
despite her smaller frame mr @entity7 says the female cub , who will be named through an online competition later in the year , is developing a strong personality already			1
@entity95 numbers across the world have dropped from half a million to only 26,000 in the last 100 years			1
mr @entity7 hopes the cubs will encourage @entity48 to support the conservation of their species the 37 - year - old said the female ' rules the roost ' and bosses her brother around			1
he described the two male cubs as ' sooks ' who preferred to cuddle up to him ' @entity95 are a social cat and when you are involved with them for this long you become part of the pride , so they do remember you and want to interact with you and they still want to have that relationship when they are older , ' mr @entity7 said ' the girl is the boss , she definitely rules the roost , which does n't surprise me , ' he said			1
' so she bosses her brothers around and even though she 's the smallest , she 's the most confident – you often find that with lions			0
' the boys are a bit sooky really , they like their cuddles and to sit with you a bit more which is often the case with male lions even when they 're bigger			0
' ' the great things about lions is they 're a social cat and when you are involved with them for this long you become part of the pride , so they do remember you and want to interact with you and they still want to have that relationship when they are older			0
that ’s a special thing you do n't get with other cat species			0
' even with them starting to find the use of their teeth and claws on household furniture , mr @entity7 , whose home on site the zoo has housed and array of animals from kangaroos and wombats to monkeys and crocodiles , says the lions are some of his most welcome house guests			2
' the cats sleep so much that it means they 're pretty good whereas when you 've got a joey it needs to be in a pouch and you have to carry it around with you and clean up the pouch regularly			0
' @entity12 has teamed up with @entity50 to document mr @entity7 's relationship with the three cubs as they grow up the company says their animals ' ' lives extend beyond the boundaries of their enclosure ' and that they often take them into new environments to enrich their lives ' monkeys also want to be with you the whole time and cling to you all day , whereas lioness ' would just have the cubs in her den and then go off and do her thing , so compared to the other animals we 've had , the lions are the easiest ones by far			1
' bringing the animals out of their enclosures and into new environments , including his home , is a regularly practiced thing at the @entity12 park			0
' animals have got so much going on in the wild – food , shelter , predators , prey and so on - when they come into captivity we supply and delete a lot of that and the mental side in captivity is hard to match , so we try to enrich their lives as much as we can which includes investigating new areas , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' the big cats for instance get to walk a kilometre a week outrside their enclosure			0
they get to investigate the frog ponds and chase skinks in the garden			0
their lives extend beyond the boundaries of their enclosure			0
