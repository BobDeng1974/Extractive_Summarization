by @entity0 @entity1 , 59 , a billionaire technology mogul who blocked access to a popular public beach a billionaire technology mogul is at war with surfers after blocking access to a popular public beach			1
@entity1 , 59 , the co-founder of @entity8 who now runs his own venture capitalist firm , appeared in a @entity11 courtroom on monday afternoon to testify in the civil dispute			1
mr @entity1 is accused of closing the only road that leads to @entity15 's beach in violation of the @entity17			1
the beach is about 35 miles south of @entity19 and is a favourite with surfers for its great waves			1
it was open to the public for years for $ 5 access and parking in @entity30 , unlike in many other states , all beaches are open to the public under the constitution			2
but private landowners are not always required to allow access to the coastline across their properties			2
many disputes have arisen over the years , often involving wealthy beachfront homeowners			2
in the case of @entity15 's beach , the previous owner had allowed locals to access the beach for a fee			0
but mr @entity1 , a father of three , who owns the land via limited liability corporations , has closed off the access road and hired guards to keep people out			1
' i get 500 to 1,000 pages of documents a week			0
i 'm not trying to be unreasonable , that is what my life is like , ' mr @entity1 testified , according to @entity65			1
' i was dumbfounded at the lack of ability to explain or remember , ' the plaintiff attorney @entity66 told @entity65 outside the court			0
for the 100 % , not just the 1 % : protesters in february hold up signs in support of beach access to @entity74 without the road access @entity76 ( pictured ) can only be reached from the ocean mr @entity1 bought the 89 - acre @entity79 property for $ 37.5 million in 2008 , reports @entity80			1
two years later he closed the gate on a private road off @entity83 leading to it - a move that incensed the @entity85 and environmentalists mr @entity1 's attorney , @entity87 , says the public was previously allowed to access the beach for a fee , so there was never a right of public access			1
according to the @entity85 because the gates were permanently locked , the usage of the land has changed - they argue that qualifies as development under state coastal law and therefore required a permit from the @entity102			0
but mr @entity1 , who has been an early backer of environmentally friendly startups , says he does not need a development permit as his lawyers argue there has been no development			1
but his attorneys claim he simply wants to establish that he can not be forced to allow people on the property and he had no specific plans for the property			0
mr @entity1 said that his attorneys have pursued the issue in court because he wants ' facts of law ' to determine what is right , rather than ' public opinion			1
' video courtesy @entity85 mr @entity1 , 59 , the co-founder of @entity8 who now runs his own venture capitalist firm , appeared in a @entity11 courtroom monday afternoon to testify in the civil dispute the dispute echoes record mogul @entity127 's long battle to prevent use of a walkway near his @entity131 home			1
in 1983 , @entity132 agreed to allow a pathway to @entity134 when he sought permits for a pool and other additions , but he later filed suit to fight the access			0
in 2005 , @entity127 settled the suit and allowed the public walkway			0
dubbed ' @entity142 , ' @entity134 has been home to titans such as @entity146 chief executive @entity145 and movie and television stars @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			0
the tiff also evokes some other neighborly disputes in recent years involving wealthy technology executives including late @entity156 co-founder @entity155 and @entity145			2
@entity155 fought a bitter battle with neighbors in @entity159 , @entity30 , over a 1920s - era house he owned but wanted to tear down and replace with something sleeker			0
he twice won demolition permits that were contested by preservationists ; the wrecking ball finally came down in 2011 , months before his death			0
the property is now vacant			0
that same year , @entity145 settled a case he had filed against his neighbors over trees he said blocked views of the bay from his house in @entity19 's @entity174 neighborhood			2
in 2012 , special - effects pioneer @entity175 , the creator of @entity177 , got so fed up with his development - fighting neighbors in @entity179 , @entity30 , that he scrapped plans to expand his @entity181 and said he would instead sell it to a developer to build low - income housing .			0
