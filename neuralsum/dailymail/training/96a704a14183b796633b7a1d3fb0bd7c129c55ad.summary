president @entity0 is enjoying strong support for his @entity3 's surveillance program from @entity5 partisans			1
polls conducted in 2006 and 2013 show a 27 per cent opinion swing among voters in @entity0 's party a poll conducted after news of the @entity3 's snooping scandal broke on thursday shows that more than one quarter of self - identified @entity5 disapproved of the agency 's surveillance programs under the @entity17 administration , but now approve of it under the stewardship of @entity0			1
the national survey from the @entity21 and the @entity22 found that 64 per cent of @entity5 approve of the @entity3 ' getting secret court orders to track calls of millions of @entity25 to investigate terrorism			1
' only 34 per cent voiced disapproval			0
when @entity21 asked a similar question in 2006 , just 37 per cent found the practice of ' secretly listening in on phone calls and reading emails without court approval ' acceptable			1
that partisan swing of 27 per cent may be related to the differences in the questions ' wording , but it suggests an overall willingness on the part of president @entity0 's partisan supporters to approve of the @entity3 's secret surveillance now that his administration is in charge			1
republicans , too , saw a shift in support for the @entity3 's programs - only in the opposite direction			2
support from 75 per cent of @entity51 supporters in 2006 dwindled to 52 per cent this month			1
the political left and right are closer in their opinions of whether @entity3 is justified in ' monitor [ ing ] emails if it might prevent future terror attacks			0
' among @entity5 , 53 per cent found that practice acceptable			1
republicans showed 45 per cent support			1
the @entity22 reported tuesday morning that ' sixty - nine percent of @entity5 say terrorism investigations , not privacy , should be the government ’s main concern , an 18 - percentage - point jump from early january 2006			1
' @entity68 house speaker @entity68 called @entity69 a ' traitor ' and expressed support for @entity0 's intelligence program			2
a majority of @entity51 voters disagree the @entity25 intelligence controversy has produced strange bedfellows among pundits and political public figures who seldom agree about anything			1
liberal firebrand @entity80 and conservative online broadcaster @entity81 have both called @entity3 whistle - blower @entity69 a ' hero ' for leaking information about the @entity3 to @entity86 and the @entity22			0
@entity88 host @entity87 also slammed the @entity3 , saying its ' unconstitutional ' surveillance program ' should be shut down immediately			2
' left - wing television host @entity90 came down in support of the @entity3			2
' i ’m okay with it now that @entity0 ’s in office , ' he said on his @entity97 talk show			0
joining him in support are @entity100 gop senator @entity99 , conservative @entity88 pundit @entity101 and former @entity104 ceo @entity103 - none of whom is generally an @entity0 cheerleader			0
right - wing broadcaster @entity81 is firmly against the @entity3 program , a position he shares with liberal filmmaker @entity80 ' i view mr. @entity109 ' [ sic ] actions not as one of patriotism but potentially a felony , ' @entity99 tweeted on monday			0
' i hope we follow mr. @entity69 to the ends of the earth to bring him to justice			0
' the @entity118 , which has picked apart @entity0 's economic programs on a regular basis , published a sunday op - ed by former @entity25 attorney general @entity121 that expressed support from the program			1
in contrast , @entity125 @entity51 rep. @entity51 , the @entity51 's vice presidential nominee in 2012 , told @entity127 on monday that the @entity3 spying program ' comes across as creepy			2
' ' to do a blanket dragnet nationwide , ' he said , ' that seems to go way beyond the scope of the law that i ’m familiar with called the @entity135			0
' @entity69 , who worked as a contract employee at the @entity3 , outed himself this weekend as the source for @entity86 's reports on @entity25 intelligence programs			2
he fled to @entity140 and is now reportedly been offered asylum in @entity142 house speaker @entity68 disagreed , calling @entity69 a ' traitor ' during an interview with @entity146			0
' the president outlined last week that these were important national security programs to help keep @entity25 safe , ' he said , \ and give us tools to fight the terrorist threat that we face			0
' but among ordinary voters , the @entity21 / @entity22 poll indicates a partisan divide that plays out among more traditional party lines			0
pollsters reached 1,004 adults in the @entity25 , including a robust sample on cell phones .			0

*56* per cent of @entity25 overall say government tracking of phone records is an ' acceptable way ' to fight terrorism
that number is *heavily* *weighted* toward @entity5 , 64 per cent of whom support the @entity3
under @entity17 in 2006 , just 37 per cent of @entity5 agreed with @entity3 snooping
@entity51 support for @entity3 surveillance also drops now that @entity0 is in charge , swinging more *modestly* from 75 per cent to 52 per cent
