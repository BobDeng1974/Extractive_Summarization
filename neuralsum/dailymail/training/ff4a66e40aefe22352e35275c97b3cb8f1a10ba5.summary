@entity0 resembles a fortress as thousands of security personnel brace for a possible showdown with the disciples of self - styled godman @entity5			1
the stand - off comes as the deadline for @entity5 to appear in a contempt case ended on monday morning			1
nearly 60,000 disciples , including women and children , have formed a human wall outside the @entity13 at @entity14 in @entity17 ’s @entity16 district			1
the stand - off bears the echoes of a similar case involving another godman			1
armed and angry : police say the godman 's supporters are carrying traditional as well as modern firearms @entity27 chief @entity26 , who faces rape and murder charges , never makes a personal appearance in court , giving his statements via video - conferencing instead			1
in this he enjoys the support of the @entity35 , who insist that @entity26 be allowed the privilege			0
returning to @entity5 , the @entity38 and @entity39 had earlier pulled up the @entity17 officials after they failed to produce the guru			1
the officials cited resistance by the godman ’s followers for their inability to present him in court			1
a large number of cars and suvs are parked outside the ashram situated on the @entity16 - @entity52 road			2
spread over 12 acres , the ashram is now dotted with pandals set up to shelter the godman ’s followers from across the country			1
standing firm : the human wall outside the ashram includes multitudes of women and children “ they ( the supporters ) are armed with traditional as well as modern firearms inside the premises			1
many of the firearms are illegal			0
the followers are chanting the godman ’s name to make their presence felt … , ” a @entity65 rank police officer said			2
@entity5 , now revered by thousands , was born @entity77 to a family of farmers in @entity83 district ’s @entity81 village besides several thousand personnel of the @entity35 , 10 battalions of @entity85 and 14 battalions of @entity87 have cordoned off the entire area			2
the security personnel have already barricaded the two sides of the road nearly one km away from the ashram			2
no private vehicles , including those of the media , are being permitted to go towards the ashram			0
the local administration has cut water and electricity connections to the @entity100			1
it has also ordered a three - day shut - down of schools near the ashram , while local hospitals have been put on high alert			2
meanwhile , pamphlets have surfaced alleging that two judges of the @entity16 civil court are responsible for the tense situation prevailing from november 10			0
one way of defusing the situation could be for the court to permit @entity5 to appear before it via video conference , @entity100 spokesperson @entity111 says			1
“ @entity5 is undergoing treatment for severe pain in the heart			2
he is not able to travel and , hence , it is not possible for him to appear in court , ” he said			0
the spokesperson adds that @entity5 has no issue with the court			1
“ he is a man of principles			0
he only has concern with the two judges who took cognisance of contempt of court against him on july 22 … , ” @entity111 claims			2
the law facilitates everyone to put his point of view before court , @entity111 adds			0
“ we have seen enough cases where courts have considered the request of concern persons , including accused , to appear before them via video conference			0
there is no conflict with the local police , ” the spokesperson contends			0
@entity143 , a follower from @entity144 , said the situation inside the ashram is deteriorating with every passing hour			0
“ inside the ashram , the followers are living on food stocks			2
the quality of water available in the ashram is big concern , ” he added			2
@entity5 's army defy state government by @entity157 in @entity52 a resolution to the week - long stand - off between the @entity17 authorities and supporters of godman @entity5 seems unlikely to come soon , as his arrest continues to remain an unacceptable option for his legions of followers			1
despite chief minister @entity169 ’s personal appeal to @entity5 to appear in court , his followers have made it clear that they will - at best - allow him to attend hearings via video - conferencing			1
besides several thousand @entity35 personnel , 10 battalions of @entity85 and 14 battalions of @entity87 have cordoned off the entire area round the ashram sources close to the state government said that two local @entity182 leaders , including @entity183 , as well as police officers had approached the @entity100 with the request that they be allowed to take him into custody , but to no avail			1
“ he is not feeling well and can not travel			0
his appearance can be marked by video conferencing			0
we will follow the court ’s directions , ” @entity100 spokesperson @entity111 said			1
the authorities have so far adopted a gentle approach because they fear any move to forcibly arrest @entity5 may result in violence , a prospect made all the more scary by the fact that the human chain around his ashram comprises multitudes of women and children			1
they are reportedly mulling the possibility of conducting the operation in the small hours of the day with the hope that they may not meet strong retaliation at that hour			0
meanwhile , sources said the @entity212 has alerted the @entity17 and @entity213 about the possibility of “ anti-social ” elements manipulating the situation to sow disturbance			0
the alert reportedly suggests a suspicion that @entity220 may mingle with @entity5 ’s supporters to spark violence			2
from ' careless ' engineer to spiritual guru by @entity225 in @entity52 this is the story of how a government engineer became a spiritual guru with thousands in thrall to him			0
speaking of modest beginnings , @entity5 ’s is about as humble as it comes			2
the ‘ godman ’ was born @entity77 to a family of farmers in @entity83 district ’s @entity81 village on september 8 , 1951			0
after school , he got a diploma in engineering and joined @entity17 government ’s irrigation and public health department as a junior engineer			0
at the age of 48 , in may 2000 , he was reportedly removed from the department for carelessness			0
by then , however , his life had already begun to change direction			0
police personnel are seen outside @entity5 's @entity250 in a photo from 2006 , when a clash broke out between his followers and a group of @entity255 a seer , @entity256 , had taken him under his wing 18 years before			1
in 1999 , @entity5 established the @entity100 in @entity260 ’s @entity259 village			1
before long , the ashram gained popularity and @entity77 began to court the title of ‘ @entity264 ’			2
he subsequently set up several ashrams across the state , including the one at @entity0 , presenting himself as an incarnation of the 15th century mystic poet @entity268			0
his band of followers hit new heights			0
but the smooth run ended soon after			0
by 2000 , he had run afoul of several @entity255 after he allegedly made derogatory remarks against the group ’s founder @entity274			0
in 2006 , the differences between the two groups culminated in a clash that resulted in the death of one person			0
this is where @entity5 ’s tryst with the judiciary begins			2
following the clash , @entity5 was arrested on charges of murder and attempt to murder and his ashram at @entity290 attached by the government			1
he was released on bail two years later , on april 30 , 2008 , after which he shifted his base to @entity16 ’s @entity0 town			0
in november 2010 , the @entity39 directed the @entity297 administration to hand the ashram back to @entity5			1
it was after the matter moved to the @entity301 that the ashram was handed over to @entity5 again on april 7 , 2013			1
a month later , on may 12 , clashes again erupted between a group of @entity305 and @entity5 ’s followers			1
two people were killed and around 100 injured as the police opened fire and lathi - charged the warring groups to control the melee			0
in july this year , @entity5 and his followers went on the rampage in a @entity16 court where he was to appear for a murder conspiracy trial dating back to 2006			1
since his release in 2010 , @entity5 , who faces contempt of court , murder and attempt to murder cases in various courts , has skipped hearings 42 times , which is why he now faces contempt charges			1
an arrest warrant was issued when he failed to heed court summons last week , and this is where the current stand - off began .			1
