by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 9 may 2013 a former nurse left with forceps inside her for three months after a routine operation was one of hundreds of patients who suffered because of preventable mistakes made by the @entity7 in recent years			1
mother of four @entity9 , 42 , went to @entity10 in @entity11 in february 2009 to undergo keyhole surgery to remove her gallbladder , but suffered ' excruciating ' pain afterwards , not knowing doctors left a seven inch instrument behind			1
hundreds of patients have serious long - term problems and some died after surgeons operated on the wrong organ or left surgical devices inside them			1
shocking : @entity9 and an x-ray showing the seven inch forceps that were left inside her for three months following an operation to remove her gallbladder during the past four years there have been 762 so - called ‘ never events ’ at @entity7 hospitals – blunders deemed so serious they should never happen			1
they include 322 cases of medical instruments being left in the body and 214 operations on the wrong limb or organ			1
in another 73 incidents , feeding tubes or medication lines were fed into the lungs instead of the stomach and in 58 cases patients were fitted with the wrong implant or prosthetic limb			1
400m aid for swamped @entity47 however , medical negligence experts say these figures are an underestimate because thousands of other incidents are never reported			2
some patients say the mistakes have left them partially disabled or in severe pain			2
one woman died after medical staff put a feeding tube in her lungs during treatment for a stroke			2
her daughter , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ‘ you feel guilty because she kept saying she wanted to come out , and we kept saying , “ you ca n’t until you get better ”			0
‘ you feel angry , because you think someone ’s killed your mum			0
’ mother - of - four @entity9 told how surgeons left the forceps inside her			1
mrs @entity9 , a nurse , was discharged from the @entity10 in @entity70 , @entity11 , in 2009			1
a subsequent x-ray showed the device inside her			0
the 42 - year - old said that four years later , she was still unable to go for long walks with her dog or play badminton or tennis as it was so painful			2
she added : ‘ the pain was just horrendous and i did n’t know why			0
i see the x-ray and i think “ oh my god ”			0
‘ being in the medical profession i just could n’t understand how a mistake like that could happen			0
’ the figures were uncovered by @entity85 ’s @entity86 in a freedom of information request			0
but @entity88 , from @entity90 legal practice in @entity91 , said there were bound to be more cases because the @entity7 only logs 25 types of errors			2
hundreds of thousands of other blunders which fall outside these categories happen each year but are never reported			0
he also argued that hospitals have no incentive to report never events because they may have to reimburse the cost of the procedure to the @entity7 as well as paying for the patients ’ long - term care			1
he added : ‘ the figures really are the tip of the iceberg			0
’ dr @entity109 , director of patient safety for @entity111 – the new body running the @entity113 – said never events should not be allowed to happen at all , adding : ‘ one is too many in any week , in any day , in any hospital			0
’ doctors could not explain ms @entity9 's discomfort after her botched operation and sent her for an mri scan case : ms @entity9 was at the @entity10 in @entity11 ( pictured ) , who have since paid her a huge compensation settlement			1

@entity9 , 42 , had instrument left inside her after keyhole surgery
nurse has been forced to change jobs and received six - figure payout
more than *750* have suffered in a similar way since 2009 , @entity131 reveals
botched care included 214 *people* who had wrong organ operated on
and @entity7 staff have left *332* medical tools inside patients
