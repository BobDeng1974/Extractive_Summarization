by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor prostitution and drug dealing provide a £ 10billion boost to the economy , new research revealed today			1
bizarre new @entity8 rules mean that for the first time illegal activities must be included in the official estimates of the size of the economy			1
it means a booming sex trade or an expansion in cannabis factories will provide a boost to @entity19 ’s economic outlook			1
illegal drug production and dealing accounts for £ 4.4billion of the @entity24 economy while prostitution is worth £ 5.3billion to @entity26 , the @entity20 said every three months the @entity20 produces an estimate of the size of the economy , or @entity26 ( gdp )			1
it covers every area of activity , from manufacturing and construction to agriculture , public services and tourism			2
however , from this autumn the figures will also have to include the value of illegal drugs and prostitution for the first time			2
it will cover the import , production and sale of illegal drugs and the ‘ provision of prostitution services ’ based on 2009 levels , the prostitution is expected to add £ 5.3 billion to the economy and £ 4.4 billion attributable to illegal drugs			1
the new economic rules mean a booming sex and drugs trade would be good news for chancellor @entity19 in all years between 1997 and 2009 the impact ranges from £ 7 billion to £ 11 billion			1
the data will class growing drugs or importing them as ‘ production ’ , buying them for home use as ‘ expenditure ’ and selling them as ‘ income ’			1
it covers crack cocaine , powder cocaine , heroin , cannabis , ecstasy and amphetamines			0
in a detailed briefing note , published today , the @entity20 examines how ‘ @entity24 cannabis production is not balanced ’ because ‘ domestic output increases by the value of sales and this is the increase in supply ’			2
it adds : ‘ household final consumption expenditure ( @entity77 ) increases by the value of sales ; less the value of electricity consumed , and intermediate consumption increases by the value of the seeds and planting stock and electricity used in production			0
‘ so there is “ extra ” demand equal to the value of the seeds and planting stock used			0
this is because we assume that the seeds and planting stock were previously recorded on the supply side but not the demand side			0
’ for prostitution , spending on renting brothels , and buying condoms and ‘ working clothes ’ will be classed under ‘ production ’			2
while some @entity99 countries give a detailed breakdown of prostitution types such as ‘ street ’ and ‘ escorts ’ , the @entity24 is not able to do this with the data available			0
the @entity20 adds : ‘ extensive data gaps have been filled with assumptions , recognising that this area of the economy is very difficult to measure			1
’ it will look at the total number of men aged over 16 - the ‘ size of the market ’ - as well as rises in the cost of clothes , condoms and renting rooms			0
a raft of changes to @entity26 is expected to add a total of £ 33billion , or 2.3 per cent , in current prices in 2009			0
it includes changes to financial services , household spending , families buying brand new cars and people building their own homes .			0

@entity20 says prostitution is worth £ 5.3billion
