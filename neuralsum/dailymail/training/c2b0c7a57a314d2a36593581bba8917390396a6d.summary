@entity0 pipped title rival and @entity3 team - mate @entity2 by just seven thousandths of a second after a nail - biting qualifying session for the @entity7			1
for once this season there were drivers other than the @entity3 duo in the hunt for top spot on the grid under the lights of the @entity15			2
yet come the conclusion it was @entity3 - and @entity0 in particular - who again just had the edge , with the @entity20 claiming back - to - back poles after starting out front in the last race in @entity24			1
now click here to read the full report			0
host commentator thank you for your company today			0
be sure to join us for what promises to be a spectacular race , and in the meantime read our developing report from qualifying			2
a brilliant radio exchange ensued @entity0 's pole lap. @entity2 's engineer : " @entity0 has beaten you by seven thousandths of a second " @entity2 : " damn it ! " and another stellar effort from @entity43 to be just a tenth shy of the @entity3 drivers			1
@entity46 @entity45 ; 2 @entity2 ; 3 @entity43 ; 4 @entity47 ; 5 @entity48 ; 6 @entity49 ; 7 @entity50 ; 8 @entity51 ; 9 @entity52 ; 10 @entity53 wow			1
@entity2 sticks it on provisional pole but @entity0 , despite locking up in the first corner , comes through ... only seven thousandths of a second quicker			1
@entity43 is the first man to launch his assault on pole			2
what can the @entity62 do ? he is really giving it his all , and as he comes over the line , yes , that 's provisional pole for the @entity71 man			1
what can the rest of the field do ? ' i have no power			0
' reports @entity50 and he is told he will have to stop on track			0
he was a real contender for pole here			2
' if we have got any more front wing put it in ' , says @entity0			1
probably an understatement to say this is n't the best of starts for the @entity3 rivals			0
they 'll all have one more shot at pole			2
anyway back on track and @entity49 is the first driver to complete a timed lap. it is a 1:46.007			0
what can @entity43 do ? he is six thousandths of a second down on the @entity98			0
@entity2 comes through and he is only seventh with @entity0 off the pace , too			1
it looks as though we have got a big upset on our hands			0
@entity104 meanwhile was furious on his team radio at the end of @entity107			1
he will start only 16th			2
' i can not believe it ! bloody engine ! bloody engine ! ' it looks as though the @entity112 was n't overly pleased with the performance of his @entity114			0
the 12 - minute session is underway in @entity46 as we determine the top 10 for tomorrow 's @entity7			1
mercedes will start as favourites , but @entity119 and @entity71 could mount a real challenge			1
watch this space ... @entity122 will start only 11th tomorrow while @entity52 seals his spot in @entity107			1
the rookie is 8 - 6 up on his world championship - winning team - mate this season			1
@entity2 , on the supersoft compound , heads to the top of the timesheets by almost half - a - second			1
so , the top four of @entity132 , @entity48 , @entity50 and @entity43 are staying in the pits , but @entity2 has gone out , meaning the championship leader will use one more set of tyres than his rivals			1
@entity138 , @entity49 , @entity51 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity104 occupy the bottom six with four minutes remaining			2
we 're revving up for the final runs here			0
the top 12 are separated by just 1.2 seconds			0
indeed the top five of @entity132 , @entity48 , @entity50 , @entity43 and @entity2 are separated by just two tenths			1
we have got a realy qualifying session on our hands here			2
@entity0 then goes fastest , but only by a whisker			1
this is really cementing @entity119 's status as challengers for pole today			1
@entity2 meanwhile , fails to go faster than either @entity48 or @entity50			1
indeed he 's 5th with @entity43 in @entity153			0
and @entity50 starts where he left off			0
the @entity155 heads to the top of the timesheets , but his lap is bettered by team - mate @entity48 , but only by three thousandths of a second			1
we 're back underway at the @entity162 - this session will determine who makes it through to the top - 10 shootout			1
that 's the first time @entity50 has been quickest in any session so far this season			1
it 's also the third different session where they 've topped the timesheets this weekend ; they 've only been quickest in four sessions the entire season			1
so , an interesting @entity176 , there			0
no great upsets in regards to the bottom six , but two ferraris at the top of the timesheets ? and @entity50 quicker than @entity48 ? it 's fair to say , none of us would have predicted that			0
and here is @entity47 gesticulating at @entity53 earlier in the session ... they 've looked strong all weekend and @entity50 and @entity48 now head a 1 - 2 in @entity46			1
@entity0 , in his @entity3 , tries to respond , but he is almost three tenths shy of @entity50 's best lap. but as i write that , @entity122 goes second fastest and @entity47 pops his @entity71 into @entity192			1
the world champions are safe , but @entity49 , who has struggled this weekend , is in trouble in 16th			0
@entity138 posts a 1:47.370 to move to the top of the lap charts with some three minutes remaining			0
@entity122 on the bubble here			1
he is 17th ... and @entity47 is still yet to post a time			1
@entity47 in a spot of bother here			1
the four - times world champion is yet to set a time with only five minutes remaining			1
he then waves his hand at @entity204 after the @entity205 , despite being on a slower lap , refused to move off the racing line			0
the @entity208 will have to go again			0
so , @entity2 has popped in a timed lap but he is only sixth , the best part of a second down on @entity132			1
he heads to the pits and takes on a set of supersoft tyres			0
@entity0 then heads to the top of the timesheets , three tenths quicker than @entity48			2
a big lock - up for @entity104 in the @entity218 and he is reporting a major problem with his brakes			0
it never rains , but it pours for those at the @entity224 - based team this year			2
but @entity51 is quickly usurped by that man @entity48			0
he 's been on fire this weekend has n't he ? his last dry pole was four years ago , here , in @entity46			2
could he repeat that feat again today ? @entity51 is leading the way with seven minutes of @entity176 gone - only nine drivers are yet to have posted times so far			2
an early mistake from @entity2 who goes in too deep on the run down to turn 8			2
instead of flat - spotting his tyres , as in @entity235 , he goes straight on , and then has to reach for reverse			0
he 'll have plenty of time to recover , but hardly an ideal start for the world championship leader			2
a lot like the incident during qualifying in @entity245 that one			0
the pit - lane is open and we are underway in @entity46			0
@entity2 and @entity0 are already on track and the latter is told to remember that he has new brakes for the opening session			1
@entity253 , the potty - mouthed chef , is in the @entity255 garage today			0
i wonder if @entity122 will be able to cook up a storm today ? apologies			2
the drivers are in their cars and we are only moments away from @entity176 - the 18 - minute opening session which will see the six slowest cars eliminated			2

@entity43 ( @entity71 ) 1664			2

@entity47 ( @entity71 ) 1067			1
@entity266 ( @entity255 ) 728			0
@entity267 ( @entity268 ) 70 social media was awash with claims @entity3 had fixed the @entity24 @entity7 in wake of the collision between @entity0 and @entity2 in @entity273			1
the theory went that the @entity208 , under orders from his team , deliberately went straight on at @entity278 in order to gift the win to his team - mate			1
it was a claim subsequently denied by @entity3 and much of the paddock			0
and you can read @entity2 ’s version of events in his @entity290 column			2
@entity291 was the surprise pacesetter in the final practice session ahead of qualifying			2
the @entity119 man was marginally quicker than @entity71 's @entity296 with the @entity3 pair of @entity298 and @entity0 only 6th			1
could we be in for an upset today ? i 'm sure many of you would be delighted to see @entity48 claim pole for @entity119 ... but something tells me @entity3 will have the pace when they need it			0
but while the race for this year ’s championship continues to intensify , much of the paddock talk so far this weekend has centred around the new radio rules … and the subsequent u-turn			0
struggling to get your head around it ? you 're not the only one			0
you can read the very latest on what is allowed , and what is n’t , right here			0
my thoughts are that it will be very hard to police ; the @entity320 have just eight men watching transmissions from 22 drivers and their respective engineers			0
i dare say it could lead to a controversy of sorts , but what would @entity328 be without some of that ? @entity0 is the man in form after his win last time out in @entity235			1
the @entity20 forced title rival @entity2 into a mistake at @entity278 to claim his first victory since july ’s @entity337 @entity7			1
the victory took @entity0 to within 22 points of @entity2 ahead of this weekend ’s race under the lights			1
the @entity7 has been an instant hit on the calendar since its debut in 2008 … and surely we ’re in for a corker this time round , too .			0

@entity0 posted the fastest time at the @entity162 to seal pole
the @entity20 was just *0.007secs* ahead of @entity2 in a hotly - contested session under the lights
@entity296 will start third with @entity71 team - mate @entity47 *alongside* him on the front row
@entity122 failed to *progress* to @entity107 and is only 11th for tomorrow 's race
@entity0 is 22 points *adrift* of his team - mate with six races remaining
