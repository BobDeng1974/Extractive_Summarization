with their flawless skin , bold red lips and tonal eyes , sir @entity12 's girls looked picture perfect as they strutted their stuff on the catwalk - but it takes a lot of work and a team of experts who work like a well - oiled machine to look this good			0
@entity25 went backstage ahead of the show and watched @entity1 and co be beautified by @entity29 's mastermind make - up artist , @entity28			1
' the look is fresh faced , youthful and natural looking			1
there 's no base , just primer on the t - zone , concealer where it 's needed and @entity49 and a hint of cheek gel on the apple of the cheeks			0
' up close and personal : the look was inspired by the beachy glamour of the @entity38 seaside to complement the clothes			1
@entity2 can be seen getting beautified ready for her close up : @entity1 is worked on by @entity28 's team who created a fresh faced , youthful and natural look for sir @entity12 's show touch up : while the skin was kept minimal , it was the lip that took centre stage and cheeks complemented the bold lip thanks to a pop of blush while the skin was kept minimal , it was the lip that took centre stage			1
‘ lips are effortless , with a pop of colour and a just kissed glow			0
the whole look is designed to look like the girls have done it themselves on the bus , they do n't care if their lipstick is smudged , ' said @entity28			1
it 's easy - and purse - friendly - to do yourself at home			0
use your finger to help create two textures , firstly pat on @entity84 in @entity85 , before applying @entity86 in @entity87 in the same fashion creating a deep burgundy colour on the lips			0

‘ i used a cream nude eye shadow on the eyelids , blending out to create a soft wash of colour before smudging kohl pencil into the lashes and only applying mascara to the top lashes , ' added @entity28			2
and it was n't just the model 's faces that @entity28 's team paid attention to : nails were beautified too ( they are yet another accessory after all )			2
