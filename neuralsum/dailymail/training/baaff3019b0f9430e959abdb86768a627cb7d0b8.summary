by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:14 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 06:09 est , 18 december 2012 tv watchdog @entity2 has launched an investigation into @entity5 's i 'm a celebrity ... @entity7 ! after producers used the young daughter of @entity11 star @entity10 in a stunt			1
@entity10 , 31 , who plays @entity15 in the @entity17 soap , had to choose from a selection of doors with different prices behind them , one of which was her seven - year - old daughter @entity13 , but picked the wrong one			1
the actress , who was later crowned the winner of the competition , did not know @entity13 would be taking part in the trial and called the task her ' lowest point '			2
the watchdog , which received 66 complaints about the episode , will also look into whether the offence caused to viewers was justified by the context			1
ms @entity48 told @entity49 after the show : ' i signed up for this show , but @entity13 did n’t			1
i did n’t want her to be so upset			2
i had no idea this was happening			2
it was my lowest point			0
' my mum gave the green light for her to be there because it was an opportunity for @entity13 to see me — and i think she thought she would			0
' distressing scenes : the disappointment on @entity13 's face was painfully clear to viewers of the reality show as @entity10 picked the wrong door in the task traumatic : @entity10 was left heartbroken after she narrowly missed out on seeing @entity13 as part of a mini-trial ms @entity48 said she felt as though she 'd been ' kicked ' when she realised what had happened and added that the incident was perhaps ' a step too far ' by the production team			1
@entity10 added : ' i kept picturing @entity13 ’s face			1
she would have been excited about seeing me and nervous about being on the show — and then disappointed when we failed the task			0
' afterwards i went straight up and spoke to the show bosses			0
they said she ‘ had a moment ’ , but assured me she was ok after they gave her a bowl of ice cream			0
' ' too far ' : the 31 - year - old actress has criticised @entity5 bosses for involving her daughter in the show a show spokesperson told @entity88 at the time : ' the permission came from @entity13 's grandmother [ @entity10 's mother ] , who was with @entity13 the whole time			1
' they were both fully briefed on how the game would work and were both happy to take part			0
a senior producer saw them both afterwards and they were fine			0
' @entity13 and her grandma come to the jungle every day with the other friends and family , so actually the experience was n't as out of the ordinary as it might look			0
' despite assurances from the i 'm a celebrity ... production team , campaign group parents outloud said : ' to involve a seven - year - old is sinking to the bottom			1
' under the broadcasting code , due care must be taken over the physical and emotional welfare of under - 18s irrespective of any consent given by a parent or guardian and under - 18s must not be caused unnecessary distress or anxiety from their involvement in programmes .			2
