‘ if i had not turned to food , i would probably have used drugs or alcohol			0
’ during his teenage years , mr @entity6 gained about 2st each year and at just 17 he suffered a mini-stroke			1
he also had such bad sleep apnoea that even breathing apparatus could not always keep him breathing normally			1

‘ i had tried so many diets in the past that i was sceptical it could work , but it was like a light bulb came on for me when i went to my first session			0
‘ for the first time i was on a weight loss programme that tackled the emotional issues of eating , and it allowed me to see why i was basically eating myself to death			2

the challenges i 've faced have made me stronger			0
' mr @entity6 added : ‘ the support i have received from the general public has been incredible too			2
‘ so many people have been staggered by how much weight i have lost			2
‘ it ’s not uncommon for people to recognise me in @entity220 from “ @entity8 ” and be shocked when they realise i have lost 29 stone			1
mr @entity6 believes he turned to food for comfort as a result of being abused as a child - he says that if he had not started comfort eating , he would probably have becoming addicted to drink or drugs ‘ the best thing about losing weight is that i can hopefully inspire others and make them realise that it ’s possible to lose weight with the right support			1
