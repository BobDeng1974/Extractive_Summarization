there was a time during last year ’s @entity1 at the @entity2 when it seemed as though the world might be about to fall in on @entity5 and his @entity7 team			1
three goals in eight minutes spanning either side of half - time left @entity7 four adrift with 40 minutes still to play			1
ultimately , the game ended 4 - 1 , an early low in a season that was to have many			2
certainly it appeared last season that the balance of power in @entity17 had tilted @entity19 ’s way and pretty much stayed there			1
the gap was big and looked set to get bigger			0
@entity21 celebrates scoring for @entity19 as they thumped @entity7 at the @entity2 last season @entity19 supporters unfurled a banner about the under - fire @entity5 during last year 's derby @entity7 boss @entity27 was all smiles during the session as he embarks on his first @entity17 derby @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 ( left to right ) train @entity37 misses out again having been sidelined for the draw with @entity39 at the @entity2 on sunday 2013 - 14 - @entity7 0 - @entity40 , @entity19 4 - 1 @entity7 2012 - 13 - @entity7 1 - @entity41 , @entity19 2 - 3 @entity7 2011 - 12 - city 1 - 0 @entity7 , @entity19 2 - 3 @entity7 ( @entity42 ) , @entity43 1 - 6 city 2010 - 11 - city 1 - 0 @entity7 ( @entity42 ) , @entity44 , @entity19 0 - 0 @entity7 , 2009 - 10 - city 0 - 1 @entity7 , @entity7 ( @entity45 ) , @entity19 2 - 1 @entity7 ( @entity45 ) , @entity43 4 - 3 city fast forward 13 months from that day in @entity47 and @entity19 have much to be pleased about			1
they have two trophies — one of them the @entity50 — and a new training ground standing in the shadow of a stadium that is undergoing expansion			1
oddly , though , @entity7 and their new coach @entity27 will travel from their base at the @entity57 on sunday morning sensing an opportunity of sorts			1
there is no swagger about @entity19 at the moment , no joy			1
their coach @entity64 looks like a man with a permanent migraine , and his players look leggy and fretful yet it is only november			0
they are the champions , they are at home and they have match - winners in their team			2
@entity7 , though , can see chinks of light through the @entity19 barricades and perhaps sense it ’s time to remind their upstart neighbours that this remains a two - club town			1
‘ in a tactical way i know what we have to expect , ’ said @entity80			0
‘ it is not the greatest moment of @entity19 , and i have said that we are growing and developing ourselves			1
we have a good feeling about this match			0
’ if @entity19 ’s problem is that they have appeared a little flat during a three - game winless run , @entity80 fears his team may suffer from an excess of energy			1
@entity35 ’s late equaliser at home to @entity39 last sunday felt like a significant one in the context of @entity7 ’s season and @entity80 expressed concern that it may have set adrenaline levels running a little too high			1
@entity19 manager @entity64 has watched his side really struggle in recent weeks @entity7 captain @entity33 has been suspended since his red card against @entity101 @entity33 ( @entity7 ) - 11 @entity102 ( @entity19 ) - 10 @entity103 ( @entity19 ) - 10 @entity104 ( @entity7 ) - 9 @entity105 ( @entity19 ) - 8 @entity106 ( @entity7 ) - 8 @entity107 ( @entity7 and @entity19 ) - 8 @entity108 ( @entity7 ) - 8 ‘ for the fans it is unbelievably big as a rivalry and i have felt that also with a lot of the players in the squad this week , ’ he said			1
‘ especially with @entity118 because when he presented the analysis of @entity19 , i felt more tension with him			1
it was good to see that			0
‘ he knows it , he has the experience as a player and now maybe as an assistant manager			0
but we do n’t have to accelerate this feeling because it is football and you have to play the game , not only a game with emotion but also in a tactical way			0
that is what we are doing , that is how we are preparing			0
‘ @entity118 has transferred the idea of emotion and i have transferred the idea of how we have to play			0
’ certainly it ’s hard to imagine anyone ever accusing @entity64 of being emotional			0
on friday , the city manager was as reluctant to add to the hyperbole that usually precedes a @entity17 derby			2
@entity80 admitted to having been impressed by @entity118 ' intense presentation on @entity19 @entity145 playmaker @entity144 will miss the derby after coming off injured against @entity43 @entity147 faces a fitness test on saturday to determine whether he 'll face @entity80 's @entity7 the day after all 20 @entity50 clubs will have this poppy on their shirts either this weekend or next to commemorate the centenary of the @entity153			1
clubs wear poppies on their shirts each year but for 2014 , the @entity156 has approved a one - off @entity157 with the citation ‘ 1914 - 2104 @entity159 ’ written underneath			0
that , of course , is the @entity163 ’s prerogative			0
it is not his responsibility to add to the sideshow , only to find a way to improve upon recent performances			2
with @entity144 absent and @entity147 facing a fitness test on saturday , @entity64 certainly has his work cut out			1
city were wretched against @entity43 in the @entity45 on wednesday and , in truth , it was a performance that had been coming			0
‘ i do n’t know what pressure is , ’ insisted @entity64			0
‘ i think it ’s very difficult to analyse the season at this moment when you are only in october and you have only played nine games in the @entity50			1
i think always you have better moments and bad moments in the season			0
‘ if you review last year ( and compare it with ) what we are doing at this moment , i think we were not playing better than today and the criticisms were exactly the same as they are today ... it ’s not good to do it but normally all the teams have the moment in the season when you are not in your best moment			0
@entity32 ( front ) is in contention to play his first game of the season for @entity7 after an ankle injury @entity200 appeared in a relaxed mood during @entity7 's training session on friday @entity203 ( left ) and @entity204 could be two of many @entity205 involved at the @entity2 the return of @entity33 ( left ) to the line - up is likely to mean @entity31 ( right ) will be dropped to the bench against @entity19 @entity209 has had a resurgence in recent weeks , and could start against @entity19 on sunday ‘ it is important for it to be at the beginning of the season and not at the end of the season			1
i ’m sure our team will be a strong team again			0
’ @entity80 was not present when @entity19 lost on wednesday			1
he sent assistant @entity218 to the @entity2 instead			1
their preparations for this game began in earnest early last week , though , when @entity80 called @entity33 , his captain , back to the training ground unexpectedly one afternoon			0
‘ i have heard that he has scored a lot of goals against @entity19 , the most of any player , ’ said @entity80			1
‘ i said that to him to stimulate him but he does n’t need that			0
i am very happy that he can play again and he shall play			0
’ @entity33 was the only @entity7 player who performed at the @entity2 last season			1
he will need some help on sunday			0
if he gets it , then @entity7 — the underdogs — have a chance			1
@entity7 attempt to regroup at the @entity2 during last year 's 4 - 1 defeat by their cross-city rivals @entity147 was on song as @entity7 were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity19 towards the end of last season both clubs are owned by foreign billionaires , united by the @entity242 family and @entity19 by @entity243			1
here @entity244 compares two contrasting financial approaches to ownership			0
owners with deep pockets £ 866m @entity243 ’s investment into @entity19 , including clearing debts and transfers			1
£ 723m money taken out of @entity7 under the @entity242 relating to their ‘ leveraged ’ takeover in 2005			2
top players do n't come cheap £ 553.2m the net transfer spending by @entity19 in the same period			2
@entity19 spent £ 950million on wages			2
£ 153.4m @entity258 spend on transfers in the first eight years under the @entity242			0
the club spent £ 1.1billion on wages			0
spending more than their share 141 per cent the share of @entity19 ’s £ 1.1bilion income spent on transfers and wages in the same eight - year period			2
54 per cent the share of @entity7 ’s £ 2.2billon income spent on transfers and wages in the @entity242 ’ first eight years			2
... but is the tide turning ? £ 250m the rough total @entity19 will spend this season on net transfers and wages , with costs being forced down to meet @entity278 ’s @entity277 rules			2
£ 350m the rough total @entity7 will spend this season on net transfers and wages , and more if they spend again in january			2
@entity282 players match up with @entity19 - @entity283			2

@entity19 go into the derby as favourites at the @entity2
the @entity50 champions have struggled in recent weeks
@entity27 's @entity7 are finally *gelling*
@entity144 is out and @entity147 faces a fitness test
