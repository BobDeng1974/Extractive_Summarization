for people that like their dating chilled out , an app that ’s been dubbed ‘ @entity4 for marijuana users ’ has just gone global			1
@entity6 ! , the app is officially described as the world ’s first global social network for cannabis enthusiasts			1
the network is designed to let users meet one another online to make friends and form relationships without being judged for their habit or views			0
the @entity18 ! app is described as the world ’s first global social network of cannabis enthusiasts			1
users share their interests ( left ) and energy levels when using cannabis ( right ) as part of their profile when @entity18 ! first launched two months ago , it could only be downloaded by users in the @entity29 who live in states that have legalised cannabis			1
but now it ’s available globally via @entity33 ’s @entity32 and @entity34 , after getting approval to widen its reach			0
the app quickly became popular in @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , with 41,000 downloads in the first six weeks and it ’s expected to a hit in the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , @entity37 reported			0
users swipe to choose to connect to people - like in the popular dating app tinder			1
when @entity18 ! first launched two months ago , it could only be downloaded by users in the @entity29 who live in states that have legalised cannabis ( a joint is pictured ) but a global version was rolled out yesterday the medicinal properties of hemp are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs			1
hemp is legal and unlike cannabis , contains little tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity63 ) , which is the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high			1
there are a rising number of firms in the @entity29 that sell biscuits containing cannabidiol extracted from hemp , believed to alleviate joint pains , treat mood disorders and even help animals lose weight			2
research has also suggested that @entity77 can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down			0
@entity82 , based in @entity83 in @entity84 , uses hemp from the cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs			2
' due in part to their small body size , dogs and cats can take advantage of small amounts of @entity77 , @entity63 and other cannabinoids found in hemp and can therefore reap the benefits of this great plant , ' the firm said			0
' we are not interested in , nor are we advocating the administration of , the well - known psychotropic compound @entity63 , in concentrations sufficient to produce the ' high ' or psychotropic effects which are normally associated with marijuana			2
' we are not advocating the administration of marijuana , by any route , to animals in order to produce medical benefit or to produce any psychotropic effect			0
' the firm writes on the @entity32 : ' chat with your connections and invite your friends who also want to engage in shared experiences within a non-judgmental environment			0
' you can use @entity18 ! to date , go out with new friends , or simply connect with people who are like you			0
as we say , “ you 've got more friends than you think			0
” ' @entity127 - based founder and ceo of @entity18 ! @entity129 , said that the app does n’t encourage the sale of marijuana but is simply a social network for people who consider it part of their lifestyle			1
it deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana in their picture section			0
despite the measures , mr @entity129 said he was surprised that the app was allowed to go global			2
writing on the @entity18 ! blog , he said : ‘ this news was a surprise , but the allowance was made because we are a responsible social network and because we focus on building connections rather than just showing off your weed			1
’ he ’s a former chief revenue officer of hash oil maker , @entity158 and says that 12 million people use some form of the drug , meaning that there is a real opportunity to connect users on a social network			1
his motivation for rolling out the app widely is personal too , because his mother used the drug to battle cancer , which mr @entity129 claims saved her life			2
‘ to you , that mother just like mine , fighting cancer in a state where the stigma still exists around weed , @entity18 ! is here for you			0
his motivation for rolling out the app globally ( illustrated with this image ) is personal for mr @entity129 , because his mother used to drug to battle cancer , which he claims saved her life the app deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana ( a stock image is shown ) in their picture section ‘ to all of you in states where cannabis is now legal , @entity18 ! is definitely here for you too ! ‘ and to the countless women and men who simply want to meet other like - minded , amazing people in a non-judgmental way , @entity18 ! is here for you also			1
’ the app has been likened to @entity4 , which also lets users swipe through prospective friends and partners			1
at its regional launch , @entity205 reported that mr @entity129 created the app after women did n’t find him appealing on conventional dating sites , because he smokes cannabis			1
‘ we wanted to build a cool piece of technology that solved the problem of where do million and millions of cannabis consumers go to meet people , connect with people and build relationships , ’ he said			2
‘ a lot of people say we ’re the @entity4 of weed , but that ’s only one facet of the whole thing			2
it ’s so much bigger			0
he says the network is actually primarily designed for platonic connections			0
‘ as we open the platform to the entire planet , i am certain meeting new like - minded people will take on some exciting new paths , ’ he added .			0
