depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder , argues one scientist			1
the condition could result from a parasitic , bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms , argues dr. @entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 if his theory is true , he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future			1
writing in the journal @entity16 , dr @entity9 said : ' it is time for an entirely different approach			1
depression should be re-conceptualised as an infectious disease caused by parasites , bacteria or viruses , argues dr @entity9 , a professor at @entity10 , @entity11 ' instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder , i suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease			1
' i propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites , bacteria , or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression			1
' he divides his theory into three arguments			2
he said patients with depression exhibit sickness - like behaviours			1
they lose their energy , have difficulty getting out of bed and lose interest in the world around them , displaying the same symptoms as people who have an infectious disease			1
studies of the patients with depression also show the presence of inflammatory markers in their brains , he said			1
these inflammatory markers might indicate the immune system has been activated in response to some kind of pathogen , which could be a parasite , bacterium or virus - this being what is causing the symptoms of depression , he argued			2
women in positions of power at work are at risk of poorer mental health than women further down the career ladder , a study has found			0
researchers found that while men tend to feel better the more authority they have , the reverse is often true for women			2
‘ women with job authority – the ability to hire , fire and influence pay – have significantly more symptoms of depression than women without this power , ’ said @entity81 , of the @entity82 , who carried out the study.2 ‘ in contrast , men with job authority have fewer symptoms of depression than men without such power			2
‘ @entity100 ’s striking is that women with job authority in our study are advantaged in terms of most characteristics that are strong predictors of positive mental health , ’ she added			0
‘ these women have more education , higher incomes , more prestigious occupations , and higher levels of job satisfaction and autonomy than women without job authority			0
‘ yet they have worse mental health than lower - status women			0
’ his second argument is that there are examples of parasites , bacteria or viruses affecting emotional behaviour throughout nature			1
the best known example is @entity127 ( @entity128 ) , a parasite which lives in the intestinal tract of a cat			0
there , it lays eggs which are dispersed into the environment when the cat excretes			0
when a rat comes in contact with these eggs and becomes infected , it becomes attracted to the scent of cat urine			0
the rat ’s behaviour is through parasitic cysts being deposited across its brain , activating the same pathways involved in sexual arousal			0
he says one third of the world ’s population is thought to be infected with @entity153			0
the infection is associated with markers of inflammation , as observed in depressed patients			0
of patients with a diagnosed major depression or bipolar disorder , those with a history of attempting suicide had higher levels of antibodies created to fight @entity167 bacteria			1
‘ yet , large - scale studies of major depression and @entity172 or systematic searches to discover other potential parasitic infections have not yet been conducted , ’ dr @entity9 argued in his paper			1
similarly , he cites a number of studies in which rodents ’ emotional behaviour changes when they are exposed to bacteria			0
large studies looking at associations between viruses and depressions exist already too , he said			0
he cites an analysis of 28 studies , which found a link between viruses and depression			1
these included the @entity189 ( @entity189 ) , the herpes virus responsible for cold sores , varicella zoster virus , which causes chicken pox and and @entity193 , which causes glandular fever			0
one study found @entity197 virus was 3.25 more likely to be found in depressed people than in non-depressed people , he said			0
another found @entity197 in the brain ’s of two out of 30 depressed patients			0
his final argument is that re-conceptualising depression as an infectious disease is useful when thinking about the genetics of the disease			1
if his theory is true , he hopes a a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future the search for specific genes linked to depression has come up empty , he said , adding : ‘ perhaps , we have been looking at the wrong organism			1
’ while studies have looked for internal changes in human genes , which might explain depression , 8 per cent of the human genome is based on external changes , such as from viruses			2
bacteria , viruses and parasistes could transfer genes into our cells , leading to changes in our genetic structure			2
they could also be passed during birth or through contact between parents and their children , he said			0
he concluded that large scale studies involving patients with depression and people without the condition should be carried out to see if parasites , viruses or bacteria could be the cause			1
he added : ‘ such efforts , if successful , would represent the ‘ end of the beginning ’ , as any such discovery would represent the first step toward developing a vaccination for major depression			2

dr. @entity9 is a professor from @entity10 , in the @entity11
argues depression should be re-conceptualised as an infectious disease
condition is caused by parasites , bacteria or viruses , he *claims*
people with depression show sickness like those suffering infection
if his theory is true , a vaccination against depression could be possible
