an avid @entity1 user has created his own font using satellite images of letter - shaped buildings in @entity5			1
@entity6 , 34 , picked out 26 buildings which look like letters of the alphabet and brought them together to make his own original font			1
mr @entity6 got the idea for his satellite font during a slow day at work			2
the complete satellite alphabet , made using images of the tops of @entity5 buildings the letter @entity19 , which mr @entity6 discovered when he had nothing to do while working for an advertising agency he then spent the next week scouring images of @entity5 buildings to try and find the complete alphabet			1
pictured is the letter c some letters , such as @entity27 ( pictured ) , would take hours to find on @entity28 , mr @entity6 said although some of the letters may have been plucked from @entity32 's aptly - titled @entity31 , he had to search across the entire city in order to find the perfect a to @entity36 he said : ' i was a designer for an advertising agency at the time			0
i did n't have much work to do so i started looking at my old neighbourhood on @entity28			0
' i noticed a building in the shape of an a and then another in the shape of a @entity45 ' i started looking for more letter shaped buildings , hunting them down in alphabetical order			0
' i 'd often spend hours looking for a single building in the shape of the correct letter			0
after a week i had collected the entire alphabet			0
' mr @entity6 , who said the photos captured from @entity1 are unedited , decided to share his font with the world by posting it online			2
mr @entity6 ( left ) tested his font by creating a mock movie poster ( right ) for the film @entity62 - the 1998 @entity61 film about a man being spied on by the @entity64 he said : ' at the moment i have n't made it a usable font but i do intend to make it a typeface people can download in the future			1
' it would be a great font for movie posters			0
' mr @entity6 , of @entity5 , even put his font to the test by creating his own movie poster for the 1998 @entity61 film ' @entity62 ' , which involves a character being spied on by government satellites .			1
