by @entity0 and @entity1 a group of @entity4 scientists have found a way to make mouse brains completely transparent			1
the advance was reported online wednesday in the journal nature by dr. @entity9 and co-workers at @entity4			1
some other labs are already working to apply the technique outside the brain , such as in breast cancer biopsies , @entity9 said			1
to create transparent mouse brains , the @entity9 team had to remove the fat that provides structure but also blocks light			2
the first step was to soak the brain in chemicals that would get inside and form a mesh			2
once that mesh was in place to support the tissue , the scientists washed out the fat			0
the result : a see - through brain			0
specialized stains can then make selected structures like brain cells visible and also reveal important chemical data , like the location of particular proteins			1
@entity54 : the findings were reported online in the journal nature by dr @entity9 and co-workers at @entity4 the stains can show details of brain circuits and the connections between different areas , as well as details of individual cells			1
' if the entire mouse brain is transparent , that makes a very large fraction of neuroscience research much easier , ' which in turn makes more experiments feasible , said dr @entity71 of the @entity72 in @entity73			1
dr @entity71 added : ' this will make a lot of neuroscientists happy			0
' that 's not just a parlor trick			0
it allows scientists see both anatomical and chemical details in their natural , three - dimensional setting			0
' what these guys have done is just stupendous , ' said dr @entity86 of @entity87			0
' you can just peer into the brain ' and get ' incredible ' images , he said			0
dr @entity86 said he was eager to try it himself , and so did @entity93 at the @entity94 , @entity95 , who called it ' extraordinary ... a great advance			0
' ' it 's exactly the technique everyone 's been waiting for , ' said @entity101 of the @entity102 , who reckoned it will speed up brain anatomy research by 10 to 100 times			1
@entity9 's team also showed the technique can work on small pieces of human brain tissue that had been stored for years after being removed from the cadaver of a person with autism			1
they are now trying the technique on a complete human brain			2
the technique is a basic tool that should apply to a variety of brain research			1
watch video here progress : although the new approach ca n't be used in living animals , it provides more anatomical detail than brain scans like an @entity124 it 's too soon to know if it might lead to discoveries that could have a benefit for treating diseases like @entity130 's or schizophrenia			2
@entity9 said the goal was to supplement rather than to replace current methods of studying brain anatomy			0
although the new approach ca n't be used in living animals , it provides more anatomical detail than brain scans like an mri			0
scientists can get fine detail by cutting the brain into very thin slices and studying each one , but experts said it 's difficult to reconstruct a three - dimensional understanding of anatomy that way			2
even a mouse brain , small enough to fit on a coin , takes hundreds of slices to get through			0
scientists have been able to make brain tissue transparent before , but experts called the new technique much more useful .			1

@entity4 study makes *rodent* 's brain completely transparent using various chemicals
specialized staining could make brain cells and reveal important chemical data
other labs are already working to apply the technique to areas outside of the brain , such as in breast cancer biopsies
