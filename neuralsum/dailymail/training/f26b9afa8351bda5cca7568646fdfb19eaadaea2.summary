a cruel couple have been banned from owning animals after they bought their children a pony - and kept it in a dark shed in the back garden of their small terraced home			1
@entity9 and @entity10 stored the cute animal in the locked 6ft x 4ft shed in their rubbish - strewn garden with no natural light at their house in the middle of @entity19 town centre , @entity20			1
a court heard the couple purchased two - year - old @entity22 as a present for their kids - but only fed him on bits of vegetables and potato peelings			1
when @entity29 inspectors found @entity22 on february 20 , 2011 following a tip - off , he was so emaciated that his backbone was visible			2
forlorn : @entity22 the pony in the back garden of a home in @entity19 where it was kept in appalling conditions after being brought as a present for two children cramped : the shabby shed surrounded by junk where @entity22 was kept at night time @entity42 heard how the poorly pony was discovered dirty and lice - infested in the couple ’s 15ft long garden surrounded by a quad bike and gas canisters			1
inspectors originally cautioned mr @entity10 , 28 , and told him to visit a vet and move @entity22 to a field			1
but when they returned two days later the pony was found in exactly the same state			2
the pony was seized and taken to a vet where it was treated for lice and malnourishment			0
on wednesday , the couple pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and failing to take reasonable steps to ensure its needs were met			0
district judge @entity67 banned the pair from owning animals for 10 years			1
lice - infested @entity22 wanders through the garden			2
former owner @entity71 said they took on more than they could handle @entity22 was so malnourished when rescued by @entity29 inspectors that his backbone was visible			2
he had been fed on vegetables and water he also gave the pair a 12 month supervision order and ordered them to pay £ 1,150 in vet and court costs			1
judge @entity67 said : ' every young girl wants a pony , but everyone knows that they are expensive and that they have complex needs			0
' but you put one into a back yard and took little care of it			0
' naively , you tried to provide the horse with food and water , but you were totally ill - equipped to deal with the animal			0
' the court heard the pony , which had been bought by the couple for their six - year - old son and 12 - year - old daughter , had been living in the shed and had been fed on a diet of vegetables for at least four weeks			1
@entity104 , prosecuting for the @entity29 , said : ' a inspector called round and was shown through the house to the garden where there was a garden area with rubbish and a shed			0
cramped : @entity112 is strewn on the floor of the shed alongside scraps of vegetables and a bucket of water urban : the small terraced home in @entity19 where parents @entity9 and @entity10 live , and somehow thought it would be acceptable for a pony to live in the back garden ' inside the shed was the pony			1
it was emaciated with its back bone clearly visible			0
it was dirty and lice infested			0
' the shed had no natural light , on the floor there was a bowl that had vegetables within it			1
' @entity9 , 31 , who is as a full time carer for her son , said yesterday ( @entity138 ) they did not realise how much care the pony would need			1
she said : ' we bought @entity22 from a man we knew because we wanted to treat our little children			1
' we did n’t realise he would be such a handful			0
but he did see daylight - it was only at night that we put him in the shed			0
' i have learnt my lesson , we were trying to find @entity22 alternative accommodation because we knew we had taken on too much			2
' the kids miss him very much - but they know it is for the best			0
' @entity29 inspector @entity152 said the pony had since been rehomed			0
he said : ' a small garden at a terraced house in the middle of @entity19 full of hazardous paraphernalia is by no means a place for a complicated animal like a pony - they need a field			0
' @entity22 could hardly turn around in the shed and the conditions were completely unsuitable			1
' he was living in darkness as the window was boarded up			0
' it was a sad case but at least it has a happy ending as @entity22 has now found a new place to live and is doing well			2

@entity9 and @entity10 bought @entity22 the pony for their two children
kept him in cramped shed with no natural light and fed it on vegetables
banned from owning animals for ten years and fined £ 1,150
