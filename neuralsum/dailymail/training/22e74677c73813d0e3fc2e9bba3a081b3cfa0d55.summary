a @entity1 woman says she is about to losing her home after ignoring a lawsuit brought against her by an angry neighbor , who is complaining about a barking dog			2
@entity7 says that her neighbor , @entity8 , sued her for ' profound emotional distress ' , claiming her dog , @entity11 's ' raucously , wildly bellowing , howling and explosively barking ' could reach 128 decibels			1
that amount of decibels makes the dogs barking almost as loud as a jet engine			0
however @entity16 never contested the lawsuit , and as a result the neighbor was awarded $ 500,000 by default , according to @entity21			1
' the sheriff comes , puts the papers on the garage and the wall and everything and saying they were going to put the house up for sale			0
' @entity48 , a civil attorney with no ties to the case , said what happened is legitimate			0
' you can bring a frivolous lawsuit and win if the other side does n't show up , ' he told @entity21			0
@entity16 admits it is her fault but for not challenging the 36 - page suit , but says @entity11 is not the problem @entity8 made him out to be - and it 's definitely not a $ 500,000 issue			1
' howling ' : the neighbor claims that @entity11 's barking can reach 128 decibels , which is close to a jet engine up in arms : @entity7 is now trying to have the decision reversed , but it 's not looking good behave : mrs @entity7 shows her dog is no terror during a tv interview inside her home ' how can you give somebody a half - a - million - dollar lien over a dog barking ? ' @entity16 said			1
' he 's just a loving , nice dog			0
' @entity16 is now fighting to have the decision reversed			1
she said her savings have been drained by legal fees already and there is still a long way to go			0
