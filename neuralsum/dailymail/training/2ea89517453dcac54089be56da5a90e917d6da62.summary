the mix - up appears to have happened when @entity14 in @entity15 - about 80 miles north of @entity16 , @entity17 - took possession of @entity20 's body after his death			2
dead wrong : @entity20 's family was aghast when the found another man 's body in their father 's coffin around that same time , the mortuary also took possession of the body of a 97 - year - old man who died in hospice care			1
somehow , the bodies were mixed up			0

oops : it 's believed the @entity14 mistakenly put the body of a 97 - year - old man in @entity20 's coffin ' i turned around and said to myself three times , ' ‘ that ’s not him , that ’s not him , that ’s not him , ' ” son @entity57 told the station			1
inside the casket was the other man - dressed in @entity20 's clothes and with a picture of @entity20 's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin			1
