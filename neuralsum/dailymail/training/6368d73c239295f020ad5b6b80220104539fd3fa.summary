just 1 per cent of women aged 18 - 30 surveyed by @entity8 said they admire mr @entity5 , the deputy prime minister , but 3 per cent said they would consider voting for @entity10			1
in fact all of @entity12 ’s party leaders proved so unappealing that most young women said they would rather vote for politicians who are from other countries or dead			1

the research , based on 1,000 women aged 18 - 30 surveyed by @entity8 , showed that 3 per cent said they would vote for former @entity37 star @entity3 in a line - up of alternative candidates			1

@entity83 , editor - in - chief , @entity8 , said : ‘ in the phase of their lives that should be the most carefree , millennial women are feeling huge concerns about work , unemployment and debt - and no one is listening			1
‘ @entity12 politicians have a huge disconnect with young women and have a big fight on their hands if they want to win the battle for the millennial vote			2
‘ the sad reality is that more and more women will become disengaged as we reach the general election			0
i fear this means few will turn out at the ballot box			0
’ young women were more impressed by foreign leaders like @entity32 and those who are not alive , like @entity27 , than the current crop of @entity12 leaders @entity111 , @entity113 president , said : ‘ i 've always believed that it 's not that young people are n't interested in politics ; it 's just that many do n't find it very accessible at the moment			2
‘ our leaders just are n't representative of the society we live in - men outnumber women four to one in @entity124 and out of a cabinet of 23 , only four are women			2
‘ how can we trust their decision making on issues that affect us , when most of them probably wo n't have any first - hand experience of them ? ‘ if more young people vote , politicians will have no choice but to take notice and serve their interests , which is why everyone should get out to their polling station in the next general election and cast their vote			2
