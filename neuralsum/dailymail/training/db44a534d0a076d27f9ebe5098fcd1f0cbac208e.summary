by @entity0 published : 16:03 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 18:52 est , 17 june 2013 a village cricket club has been hit for six after health and safety officials told it to stop using hard balls on its pitch during batting practice			1
@entity9 in @entity10 has been told that it can only use proper cricket balls for practice inside the cricket nets and not on the field as it has done for 37 years			1
the new health and safety ruling has been drawn up @entity17 parish council because of fears that members of the public could be hit and injured by stray balls			1
bowled out : club members , left to right , @entity23 , @entity24 , 18 , @entity25 and @entity26 , 13 but club officials have refused to agree to the new set of rules , governing the use of the @entity31 in @entity17			1
@entity9 chairman @entity32 said talks were now in place to move the team away from the village to a new base at nearby @entity38			2
he said : ' we are a cricket team - how are we supposed to practice without cricket balls ? are they expecting us to use tennis balls instead ? ' it 's upsetting - i 've spent 10 summers nurturing the cricket square and you can really bat on it			2
' mr @entity24 said it was common for batsmen and bowlers at any club to practise outside of the nets , adding that the nets at the ground were of a poor quality			2
the move will mean that club cricket will no longer be played in the village and the name of @entity9 , established in 1934 , will disappear			1
@entity9 in @entity10 has been told that it can only use proper cricket balls for practice inside the cricket nets ' it 's a sorry saga , and this is something that the council really did not want to do			1
but they have to come to the table and adhere to the rules			2
' council clerk @entity72 the club which plays in the @entity74 is now set to rename itself @entity75			1
the parish council is refusing to back down even though villagers have signed a petition in support of the cricket club			1
the new rules for the use of the field state : ' batting or bowling practice with a cricket ball or other solid or semi-solid practice ball must only take place inside the batting cage [ nets ]			0
under no circumstances may this take place elsewhere			0
' council clerk @entity72 said the rule was included in a complete set of new ground regulations to satisfy insurers ' demands and protect people at the nearby bowls club , children on the play area and young people who also used the facilities during the week			1
she said the rules were being enforced to ' protect the public ' as there had been a couple of recent ' near misses ' in which other people on the field had almost been hit by cricket balls			1
mrs @entity72 said the council had other issues with the club including a mobile scoring hut being used without permission and concern about individuals being ' aggressive ' at council meetings			2
but she added : ' it 's not a done and dusted deal			0
they can come and sit at the table and be polite and we can go forward from there			0
' mrs @entity72 said the club has been written to at least 12 times , requesting information that they had to comply with and confirmation that they would agree to the rules			1
she said : ' it 's a sorry saga , and this is something that the council really did not want to do			0
but they have to come to the table and adhere to the rules			0
' the council agreed last week that the cricket club 's behaviour was ' unacceptable ' and banned it from the field for the rest of the season			2
but it agreed that the ruling could be reversed if to complied with the regulations			0
@entity9 honorary treasurer @entity25 said : ' the parish council kept coming up with rules and regulations			1
' this has been bubbling up for a long while			0
they wanted all our players to sign the rules and regulations , but they were n't happy			0
' they said they did n't have the fixtures in time , and that the insurance details were n't up in the pavilion			0
' ' it 's very sad for @entity17 , which should always have a cricket club			0
but we 're 99.9pc certain to move to @entity38 and change our name			0
' the move will probably pay off , because @entity169 should have a cricket club and it will attract youngsters to play			0
