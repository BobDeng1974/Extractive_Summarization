tragic @entity1 's family have spoken of their fury at sir @entity4 over the @entity6 ' legal battle to claim $ 13million from insurers after canceling tour dates in the wake of her death			1
miss @entity1 's closest loved ones are astonished by @entity4 's ' unbelievable ' decision to reap financial settlement and question his commitment to his girlfriend of 13 years , who hanged herself on march 17			1
miss @entity1 's sister @entity18 was so upset by the @entity6 front man 's actions , who the family accuse of ' opening up old wounds , ' she could n't bring herself to comment			1
but her husband @entity24 , 58 , spoke for the family and told @entity26 exclusively : ' we just ca n't believe @entity4 's doing what he 's doing			2
' speaking at the couple 's home near @entity51 , @entity52 , he said : ' the guy [ @entity4 ] does n't need the money , i laughed when the insurance company turned down his claim			1
' all the s * * * that @entity4 is claiming about being unstable , it 's ridiculous he 's trying to get his way			2
in a way , i 'm not surprised he 's doing it			0
the guy is just unbelievable			0
' the band postponed the @entity32 and @entity33 dates of their world tour when miss @entity1 died in march of this year , then made a claim for the costs against their insurance policy			1
but the insurers are refusing to pay out , saying the policy did not cover suicide			1
a judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from miss @entity1 's brother , @entity76 , to find out more about her mental state			1
however , mr @entity76 told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons			0
the documents , filed by the insurers and obtained by @entity26 from the federal court in @entity51 , claim @entity4 's ' acute traumatic stress illness ' was ' due to known , pre-existing physical , psychological and medical conditions of miss @entity1 '			1
it 's alleged miss @entity1 ' had been suffering from a mental illness ' and ' either received , or at least had been recommended , medical attention ' , therefore her death should not be considered to be ' sudden and unforeseen '			1
the underwriters make reference to miss @entity1 's ' lack of care , diligence and / or prudent behavior in committing suicide by hanging herself ' , which they believe ' increased the risk and / or likelihood of a loss otherwise recoverable under the policy '			1
in the 105 - page document the eight insurers , led by @entity104 and @entity105 , both based in @entity107 , claim these points are suitable reasons for denial in settling the claim from the @entity6			2
the @entity6 ' insurance policy was covered for $ 24million , while the tour was expected to make $ 44million			2
an autopsy confirmed miss @entity1 's death was suicide after she was found in her luxury @entity119 apartment			1
family portrait : childhood photos of @entity1 in @entity52			2
the intimate family photos were shared by @entity1 's sister @entity18			1
pictured : ( back row from left ) @entity76 , @entity124 , @entity125 , ( front row from left ) @entity1 and @entity18 in 1967 @entity4 greets his late partner @entity1 before her catwalk show last year @entity4 developed the acute traumatic stress disorder after losing his long - time partner , according to the papers			1
symptoms include flashbacks , nightmares , feelings of guilt and emotional numbness			0
if the disorder persists for more than one month , it becomes traumatic stress disorder			0
the singer was subsequently instructed by doctors to take a month off , forcing the @entity6 to cancel live shows in @entity32 and @entity33			2
however the underwriters have accused the rocker of failing to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist before abandoning the scheduled dates @entity148			0
@entity24 , shaking his head in disbelief , told @entity26 : ' i read that he 's claiming $ 12.7 million due to the cancellation of the [ @entity6 ] tour and i ca n't understand that			0
@entity1 left her entire estate to him and that was valued around the same amount			1
how distraught could he have really been , seriously ? it was only a month or two after @entity1 's death he was with this ballerina or whatever			1
i mean how distraught [ was @entity4 ] ? ' defending his late sister - in - law miss @entity1 he says : ' @entity1 was n't mentally unwell , you know it 's just some times life catches up to you			1
' @entity24 told how @entity18 , 54 , is ' finding it hard ' to discuss her sister right now , adding : ' the whole situation is a big ball of weight being dragged behind her and it 's opening up old wounds			0
' the underwriters claim suicide was not covered in the $ 13million policy taken out by the @entity6 if they were forced to cancel their tour			1
the @entity6 frontman published a statement on his website soon after @entity1 's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life last month , the insurers also filed a lawsuit in @entity189 's federal court , and subpoenaed @entity190 , the executor of @entity193 's will ; the @entity189 medical examiner ; and @entity195 , her @entity196 assistant			1
the move was an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an ' actual or alleged attempt at self harm by @entity193 ' as well as her general mental health , or an ' actual or alleged suicide attempt '			0
miss @entity1 , a fashion designer and model , was 49 when her body was found in her @entity119 apartment by @entity209			1
an autopsy confirmed her death was suicide			0
her fashion business had been £ 4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at @entity216 , supposedly due to technical difficulties			0
there were also reports she and @entity4 had split up , leaving her ' devastated ' , although @entity4 's spokesman denied this			2
documents filed at the district court in @entity51 , @entity52 , reveal miss @entity1 was on a long list of family on the @entity6 ' insurance policy			1
also on @entity4 's list were his ex-wives @entity229 and @entity230 , former girlfriends , seven children and four grandchildren			2
the documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked			2
the revenue for the tour was expected to be £ 28million , and this could have gone up if 15 extra @entity241 dates were added			0
the insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy			0
a spokesman for the @entity6 declined to comment			0
lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment			0
* the samaritans can be contacted by phone in the @entity252 1 ( 800 ) 273 - talk and in the @entity196 on 08457 909090 or www.samaritans.org			0
hell - raisers : @entity254 and @entity255 the @entity6 may still be going strong , but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle			1
hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered			2
for example , and perhaps not surprisingly , the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist @entity255 related to ' alcohol abuse , liver failure and / or disease and osteoarthritis '			0
more unusually , anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006 , when he was hit on the head by a coconut , will not be covered either			0
for @entity254 , anything to do with ' alcohol abuse ' is also not covered			0
the exemptions for drummer @entity282 include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica			0
the documents show the band expected to receive $ 46.6million for their tour			0
just three shows in @entity291 were worth $ 14.3million .			0

the stones were forced to postpone @entity32 and @entity33 leg of tour after @entity1 committed suicide
@entity1 left her entire estate to @entity4 but he wants insurance money
stones ' insurers refused to pay out as policy did not cover suicide
in *stunning* court documents , insurers are seeking *private* medical *information* about @entity1 from her brother
insurers claim @entity1 ' had been suffering from a mental illness ' and ' therefore her death is not considered to be ' sudden and unforeseen '
they cite miss @entity1 's ' lack of care , diligence and / or prudent behavior in committing suicide by hanging herself '
