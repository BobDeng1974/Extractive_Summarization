it is the smallest computer in the world - and 150 of them can fit in a thimble			2
called the @entity5 , to tiny technology is a complete computer system			1
its inventors say it can act as a smart sensor , and give everyday objects computing capabilities			0
the @entity5 is the smallest computer in the world , measuring less than 2mm across			1
the @entity5 contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light , including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight , allowing the computers to run perpetually			1
this line of ' smart dust ' devices includes computers equipped with imagers ( with motion detection ) , temperature sensors , and pressure sensors			1
by strobing light at a high frequency , the operator is able to send information to the computer			1
once the @entity5 processes the data , it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies			1
the @entity37 is the first complete , operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across			1
' to be ' complete , ' a computer system must have an input of data , the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it , make decisions about what to do next – and ultimately , the ability to output the data			1
' the sensors are the input and the radios are the output			2
the other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power			1
' the @entity37 contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light , including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight , allowing the computers to run perpetually			1
this line of ' smart dust ' devices includes computers equipped with imagers ( with motion detection ) , temperature sensors , and pressure sensors			1
they are the culmination of work initiated by @entity49 and @entity75 on very low - power processing for millimeter - scale systems			2
a key breakthrough in the size / power matchup came with the @entity81 processor in 2008			2
the @entity81 processor is miniscule at 915 x 915µm2 , and boasts ultra-low operating voltage and a unique standby mode that results in an average power consumption of only @entity85			0
( consider that @entity86 is the average power consumption of a single human cell			0
) @entity49 explained why @entity81 's extreme energy efficiency is so important : ' as you shrink down in size , the percentage of the system tends to be dominated by the battery			2
' it 's actually not hard to make chips small , but it is hard to make them low power			0
' we could have very small chips , but we 'd still end up with really large batteries			0
' this line of ' smart dust ' devices includes computers equipped with imagers ( with motion detection ) , temperature sensors , and pressure sensors			1
one key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information , its inventors say			0
the solar system allows the computer to work under indoor lights without ever having to be charged			1
' with a 1mm2 solar cell producing @entity124 , the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually , ' the team say			1
the device 's standby power consumption is @entity129			0
that 's about a million times less power than the average mobile phone consumes while on standby , or the comparative difference between the thickness of a sheet of paper and the length of a football field			0
there are currently three different systems in the @entity142 family , focusing on several different applications : sensing temperature , pressure , and taking images			2
' down the road we want these sensors to be able to talk to one another , ' says @entity49 , ' and we 're currently working to extend their range to about 20m			0
' the working computer is smaller than a grain of rice programmed and charged via light and could be used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes			2
one key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information			0
numerous specks of technology could be discretely placed to invisibly monitor a home , business , or personal device			0
' we found that a lot of people were very interested in these devices , and that 's why we went with the modular or stacked approach			0
' it 's the key aspect of our design			0
if you need a different sensing modality you take out one sensor and replace it with another - like mix and match tinker toys			0

@entity5 @entity5 is a complete computer system less that *5mm* across
contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light
can be equipped with cameras , temperature and pressure sensors
