four hikers and a young , unconscious girl were saved from deadly rising tides after they formed a human chain and were airlifted to safety			1
the walkers were on the coast by @entity8 state park , @entity9 , on saturday when the tide started drawing in , trapping them off - shore			1
there were initially eight people in the group - but three jumped into the freezing water and managed to swim to shore , while the others waited for rescue			2
one of the walkers ( circled ) waits for an airlift @entity27 shot from the shore shows the remaining walkers stumbling through the waves - clinging to one another for safety			1
they appear to be carrying one of their number , who is shorter than the other walkers			0
the bystander , who passed the footage to the @entity42 news channel , said she was a girl and had passed out			2
they fled away from the shore onto higher ground due to the oncoming waves			0
they eventually scrambled up onto a rocky outcrop , where they could wait for rescue			0
to safety : after linking arms to survive the high swell pulling at their bodies , the walkers were lifted away by the @entity57			1
one girl , who had passed out during the struggle with the sea , was taken to hospital rough weather : the helicopter rescue might not have been possible were the craft stationed further away , the local fire department chief warned the group was saved when a @entity57 helicopter swooped in			1
each of them was pictured being airlifted away from the rocks			0
one of the rescued walkers was flown to hospital			0
the others seemed to be unharmed			0
the rescue was carried out by a @entity57 helicopter from the nearby @entity77 station - which is controversially due to close at the end of november , moving the helicopter much further away			1
@entity81 fire chief @entity80 suggested the rescue could have gone very differently without the nearby chopper			0
he said : ' there were five frightened , cold , wet people stranded on those rocks , i needed a helo here in 10 minutes , not an hour			2
' we depend on the @entity57 helo			2
the surf is too dangerous and too cold for firefighters to enter the water and time is not a luxury you have when performing rescues			0
