facing run : whistleblower @entity1 a hospital manager who spoke out about staff locking up vulnerable patients said last night that he faces ruin despite a government pledge to protect whistleblowers			1
@entity1 told his @entity10 bosses children and pensioners were being restrained and locked in hospital cubicles for up to 12 hours without food or drink			1
he said guards were being ordered almost every day to throw patients to the ground and drag them to rooms before holding the door shut so they could not get out			2
pensioners were being restrained to ease the burden on overstretched doctors and nurses , mr @entity1 said			1
he said the violent security policy even led to the death of an elderly man at failing @entity27 in @entity28 in the @entity29 , the largest of the three run by the @entity30			1
mr @entity1 managed security staff across the three hospitals , but after repeatedly raising concerns with his bosses he was suspended in november 2012 and sacked five months later after a disciplinary hearing			1
he won an appeal but was again ordered out on ‘ special leave ’ in january – two days after an article about @entity27 restraining patients appeared in the media			1
bosses have since written to mr @entity1 to say he was being removed because speaking out about his ‘ concerns about the alleged illegal restraint of patients ’ could have put him in ‘ a very difficult position ’			1
now , despite repeated reassurances from health secretary @entity47 that whistleblowers will be protected , he has been given 30 days ’ notice of his potential redundancy			1
it is thought the hospital – which is under investigation over high death rates – has spent around £ 100,000 of taxpayers ’ money on the case			2
last night mr @entity1 told the @entity58 he felt forced to speak out , but now faced ruin			1
‘ because i spoke out i was treated awfully , ’ he said			0
‘ as a whistleblower , i have been treated worse than a common criminal			0
the hospital just deny , deny , hide , hide			0
’ he added : ‘ this is about people in that hospital who are being harmed psychologically and physically every day			0
their rights to self - determination are being totally disregarded			2
that could be a relative of yours being put through hell – not just for a few hours , but for days and weeks			1
’ mps and campaigners said there were serious questions over mr @entity47 ’s ability to crack down on the vilification of whistleblowers			0
the health secretary says creating a culture of ‘ openness and transparency ’ in the @entity10 is vital to prevent a repeat of the @entity84 scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly			1
@entity47 has given repeated reassurances that whistleblowers will be protected he banned gagging clauses last year after the @entity58 revealed the case of former @entity90 hospitals chief @entity91 who broke a £ 500,000 gagging clause to speak out about high death rates			2
mr @entity47 then made urgent changes to the @entity10 constitution last week after the @entity58 reported that whistleblower @entity97 had been threatened with the sack for speaking out about hospital bosses in @entity100 fiddling death figures			1
abandoned : @entity102 a frail pensioner died after being removed by security guards at @entity27 in a shocking incident hospital bosses allegedly tried to cover up			1
@entity106 , 73 , had become angry and upset when he was taken to @entity107 by ambulance after collapsing on a freezing november evening in 2008			2
the academic , whose family live in @entity111 , was taken outside in a wheelchair by guards at 1am and left alone at a bus stop			0
mr @entity102 , who lived alone in @entity115 , @entity29 , was discovered dead just over four hours later by a passerby 50 yards from the hospital			2
last night his friends said his death was ‘ despicable ’ and claim they were asked to keep quiet			0
the @entity30 said mr @entity102 ’s friends were visited after his death by then chief executive @entity121 and a senior consultant			0
the trust denied the friends were told not to speak to the press			0
at his inquest , registrar dr @entity126 said : ‘ i would have assumed a taxi would be called or another method found			0
’ the coroner recorded an open verdict			0
he said @entity10 contracts would now include a ‘ right ’ to raise concerns about care and a national helpline would be set up to offer advice to potential @entity10 whistleblowers			1
mr @entity1 ’s case suggests hospital bosses are continuing to defy government orders			1
@entity143 mp @entity142 , a member of the @entity145 health select committee , said : ‘ if we continue to see this sort of behaviour we will need to look at whether the law is strong enough			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s local @entity151 mp @entity150 has now written to the health secretary demanding to know if and how mr @entity1 will be protected			2
former policeman mr @entity1 , 58 , repeatedly raised concerns with his bosses about the restraint of vulnerable patients from 2010			1
he also contacted children ’s charity @entity159 who drafted a damning report warning bosses the practice violated civil and criminal law			0
mr @entity1 was accused of gross misconduct for showing ‘ aggressive behaviour ’ and parking in hospital bays he was n’t allowed to use , which he denies , before being suspended in 2012			1
he says the case against him ‘ has everything to do with whistleblowing ’			0
the trust denies mr @entity1 ’s claims but admits security staff raised concerns about restraint			1
the @entity30 accepted mr @entity1 spoke out about restraint and this has formed part of a claim he is making at an employment tribunal			2
however , it said he did so simply as part of his job and he had not done so through the hospital ’s official whistleblower policy			0
chief executive @entity187 added : ‘ there are occasions where patients have required restraint to be used for their own safety and the safety of our staff and other patients			0
however , we emphatically refute the suggestion that we unlawfully restrain patients			0
‘ we encourage our staff to raise genuine concerns at the earliest opportunity using our whistleblowing policy			0
’ a spokesman for @entity47 said : ‘ these are very serious allegations , and that ’s why the @entity207 has already been asked to carry out an investigation at this hospital			0
’ the @entity210 said mr @entity47 has been ‘ absolutely clear that @entity10 staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out in the interests of patient safety must be protected and listened to ’ .			2
