by @entity0 a tattoo addict had agonising skin grafts to remove his teen body art - only to spend nearly £ 15,000 redoing them all over his face and body			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , blames the impulse to ink himself on extreme @entity12 - which has seen him change his appearance radically several times in the past five decades			1
as a teen he was a skinhead before growing his hair and opting for the tattooed rock fan look			2
after : he later spent £ 15,000 having them redone over his face and body , right @entity7 , showing off the tattoos on his back , blames the impulse to ink himself on extreme @entity12 he then cut his hair and had all his inkings removed through painful skin grafts so he could start a white - collar career as an administrator			1
but now , the 58 - year - old has gone full circle - tattooing most of his body , even his eyelids			1
the father says he has re-invented himself as ' the coolest looking guy in @entity9 ' - but the move has not gone down well with his wife or children			1
he said : ' @entity12 has completely ruled my life			1
once i get started on something i just get carried away			1
' a lot of people look at me aggressively			2
they look almost saddened and angry but i do n't understand why - it 's me who 's looking like this , not them			2
he says his condition has made him change his appearance radically several times over the past five decades @entity7 , pictured , has gone full circle since his youth by tattooing most of his body , even his eyelids ' but i love the attention			1
i love being different and i love showing people that it is okay to be different			0
' mr @entity7 was part of the skinhead cult as a teenager			1
he says he then became obsessed with heavy metal - along with the long hair and tattoos			1
along with his fellow music lovers , he covered his arms and shoulders in inkings - but he had to have them all removed after landing himself an office role - eventually working his way up to a £ 30,000 - a - year job as an administrator			1
after years of change mr @entity7 finally turned his back on his carefree @entity82 life in @entity83 , world travels and excessive drinking to finally settle down at the age of 45 - getting married to @entity86 , 42 , and having children @entity87 , 11 , @entity89 , eight , @entity90 , five			1
@entity7 turned his back on his carefree @entity82 life in @entity83 and settled down at the age of 45 , getting married to @entity86 , 42 , in 2001 , pictured @entity7 is pictured last month next to wife , @entity86 , and their children @entity96 , 14 , @entity90 , five , @entity89 , eight and @entity87 , 11 he also became a father to @entity86 's daughter @entity96 , 14 , from a previous relationship			1
then , five years ago , after nearly 10 years of marriage , he felt an overwhelming urge to return to his first love - tattoos			1
he said : ' i had some tattoos done on my arms when i was 17 but i had them all taken off with skin grafts after changing my mind			2
' it has only been later on in my life that i realised i should have stuck to my original beliefs and been true to myself			2
now , i 've come around full - circle			2
' i do n't know how many there are in total			0
it is just one big project			0
' but getting my whole head tattooed was a very extreme , intense experience			2
' there was a feeling of euphoria coming out knowing i had got another new piece and that i 'd managed to stand the pain			0
despite paying £ 15,000 for the tattoos , @entity7 , pictured left in the 1980s and , right , earlier this year , admits the art does not fit in well with his conservative lifestyle ' at times it was very , very painful especially around the corner of the eyes , the lip and parts of the inner ear - that was absolutely killer			1
' but he admits it does not fit in well with his conservative lifestyle			2
he added : ' it does n't go down to well at work , i 'm like a fish out of water there			0
' generally speaking , younger people tend to really , really like the way i look			0
' i get a lot of really positive reactions and they say stuff like ' hey , that 's sick , that 's really cool '			0
' but then on the other end of the spectrum you 've got the older ones who are not so favourable			0
' i had one woman who was probably about 75 and upwards , who was with her very straight - laced conservative - type husband , look right into my face and said ' oh my @entity156 '			1
' so i said it straight back			0
what 's the big deal ? ' up close : @entity7 has the words ' @entity160 ' and ' @entity162 ' inked above his eyelashes not surprisingly his new appearance went completely against the wishes of his wife - even though he managed to convince her to get her own done after paying £ 1,500 for the rose and heart designs on her forearm and shoulder blade			1
mrs @entity173 , a former cleaner from the @entity174 , said : ' i never would have married him if he looked like this when i met him			0
' i feel embarrassed when we are out and everyone stares			2
but he 's a good husband and a good father and i persevere			0
' people think i am with him for the money but that 's not true			0
i love him , that 's why we got married			0
' his new look has also put him at odds with his children			0
@entity7 , pictured with his family in 2005 , cut his hair and had all his inkings removed through painful skin grafts so he could start a white - collar career as an administrator @entity89 , who is learning kung fu and enjoys video games , said : ' i think it looks a bit ugly			1
my mum does n't like it and i kind of agree with her			0
he looks kind of evil			0
' i see it every day so i 'm not really bothered but people always look at him and then they look away			0
' my friends at school think he 's cool and awesome			0
but he 's just a regular dad to me			0
' despite his family 's objections , mr @entity7 is pushing ahead with even more tattoos and is in the process of finishing off a huge inking that spans his entire back			1
even then it is unlikely he will stop and he is already planning to use his new look to audition for hard - man acting roles on television			2
he added : ' i 've had them done now so i may as well try and make them work for me			0
