by @entity0 tracking people online and showing personalised adverts is already a controversial topic and now @entity4 is set to ruffle feathers further by tracking people in the real world too			2
according to reports from tech website @entity10 , the search giant is testing a program that would follow users around the high street to see which shops they visit			1
each time a user enters a store of business , @entity4 would be able check to see if that user looked at adverts for that company online beforehand to check the ad 's conversion rate			1

each time a user enters a store of business , @entity4 can check to see if that user looked at adverts for that company online to check the ad 's conversion rate earlier this year @entity4 announced a feature called estimated @entity32 , and in particular , estimated cross-device conversions			1
as the name suggests , @entity4 plans to use this tool to track conversion rates across devices			1
for example , if a user shops for jeans on their mobile by clicking on an advert for a particular company , and then buys a product from that company on a desktop browser , @entity4 counts this as a cross-device conversion			2
to track the customer they have to be signed into their @entity4 account across each of their devices			0
recent reports found @entity4 makes around $ 100 million a day by selling @entity56 to businesses online			2
it tracks conversion rates online when either a user clicks directly on an advert , or the user visits the website featured in an advert during its browsing session			1
@entity4 can already access certain information about a user through its own apps , such as the mobile @entity71 browser , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
if users have ‘ location services ’ activated and then have one of these apps is open , or running in the background , as they shop on the high street , @entity4 can pinpoint exactly where they are			1
the location 's accuracy is improved if a customer accesses a company 's @entity84 , for example			0
in a blogpost in october , @entity4 hinted at plans to extend how it tracks people and said : ‘ as consumers are increasingly on the go and switching between devices , marketers are telling us they want to see a more complete and accurate picture of how their online advertising drives conversions			1

if users have ' location services ' activated and then have these apps running in the background as they shop on the high street , @entity4 can pinpoint exactly where they are ‘ conversions can come in many forms : visits to stores , phone calls , app downloads , website sales or purchases made after consulting various devices			1

@entity4 has not yet responded to @entity141 's request for comment			0
@entity143 , director of privacy campaign group @entity144 , told @entity141 : ' location data is some of the most sensitive information that can be collected from our phones , with few people realising just how our phones are capable of monitoring our every movement			0
' it ’s no surprise that @entity4 wants to join its online tracking with snooping on our real - world location to build a more detailed picture of our lives			2
' people need to be given a clear choice about when they share their location data , and one vague opt - in when using a map should n’t give @entity4 carte blanche to then constantly track our location			0

@entity4 *believed* to be testing a *system* that tracks users on the high street
it could use a person ’s location to determine what shop they are in
@entity4 could then see whether the user looked at an online advert for that shop before visiting
this could help the company determine conversion rates for its online ads
@entity4 hinted at plans to extend how it tracked conversions in october
