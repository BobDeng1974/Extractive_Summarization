royal course renamed @entity1 as @entity1 in her honour by @entity4 published : 06:05 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 04:50 est , 20 june 2012 the @entity5 arrived for @entity6 today amid all the pomp and pageantry expected at the first day of the world - famous race meet			1
as befits @entity15 tradition dating back 300 years to when @entity17 founded the @entity6 in 1711 , the monarch , accompanied by @entity12 in the horse - drawn royal carriage , led a procession from from @entity19 to the @entity21 race course this afternoon			1
@entity5 , whose choice of hat colour is always the subject of frenzied bets , looked immaculate as ever in a powder blue dress and coat by @entity28			1
the colour would have come to no surprise to @entity15 fashion watchers , who recently found that the @entity5 last year chose to wear blue on 29 per cent of her public engagements - three times as often as she wore any other colour			1
her trimmed hat , by @entity37 , matched the fabric of her coat perfectly , and on her lapel she wore an impressive diamond and aquamarine brooch			2
prince @entity12 , who has recovered well from the nasty bladder infection that saw him admitted to hospital following the jubilee weekend celebrations , sat beside his wife for the short journey			0
best dressed : the @entity5 looked splendid in a powder blue coat and dress as she arrived by carriage with prince @entity12 for the opening day close : the @entity5 and @entity52 chat as they enter the @entity54 - but up until 1955 , divorced women were prohibited from entering thanks to stringent rules , meaning @entity52 would not have been allowed to join the monarch in her element : the @entity5 has seen 63 of her horses win at @entity6 over the years			1
right , prince @entity12 accompanied his wife to the meet today the @entity5 was greeted by cheers and applause as she arrived at the course , and shouts of @entity66 rang out around the parade ground as she entered in the royal carriage			1
the royal couple waved at the crowds as they made their way down the racecourse , many racegoers giving three cheers for the @entity5 as the carriage went past			1
umbrellas had been stowed away in each carriage , but despite a few clouds in the sky , the sun shone on the royals			0
the @entity5 and @entity12 were joined by the @entity82 and @entity83			1
the @entity84 , following in the second carriage with the @entity12 , wore a stone - coloured dress and coat by @entity88 , a @entity90 hat and gold @entity93 shoes			1
one cheeky racegoer shouted out : ' @entity95 ! ' as the carriage went by , causing the @entity12 to turn around with a smile and wave			0
princess @entity99 , riding in the third carriage , cut a sophisticated figure in a teal dress with black lace shoulder detail and a fishtail skirt , a remake of a vintage dress made for her by @entity108			0
family affair : the @entity5 was joined by @entity52 , in metallic - trimmed beige coat , and @entity99 , in teal dress , for today 's meet chic : after the success of her cream outfit at yesterday 's @entity117 ceremony , @entity52 once again wore a pale cream outfit			1
right , the @entity5 is traditionally joined by fellow @entity119 and their guests dapper : prince @entity12 swapped his feathered hat from yesterday 's @entity117 procession for a smart top hat as he sat beside @entity52 for the carriage procession picking a winner : the @entity5 examines the running order from her vantage point in the royal box , while right , princess anne cheers as she watches @entity131 win the @entity132 looking mint : @entity134 ( left ) wore a pale green dress with matching jacket , trimmed with a wide - brimmed hat smart : princess @entity99 adhered to the dress code in her neat teal outfit with black trim and peplum , a remake of a vintage design specially made for the princess by @entity108			1
she paired the dress with @entity148 suede heels , a @entity150 teal hat and @entity152 bag			0
@entity153 , @entity99 with the @entity154 many racegoers chose to wear red , white and blue in celebration of the jubilee year , others wearing @entity161 hats			1
the racecourse has been decorated with four kilometres of bunting to add to the occasion , with a 1950s style street party taking place in the @entity168 area			0
over the week , 80,000 @entity161 flags are being handed out to racegoers watching the royal procession			2
in the @entity6 programme , a message from the @entity5 reads : ' i extend a warm welcome to everyone attending @entity6 in my @entity159 year			1
' as i reflect on the last 60 years , much has changed for our world and of course for @entity6			0
however , one constant is that each year the eyes of all those who love horseracing are upon these beautiful surroundings during this special week in june			2
' the best horses convene here , trained and ridden by the best in their profession and increasingly we have competitors and visitors joining from all over the world			0
' i would like to thank you for the welcome my family and i have always received at @entity6 and to wish you all a most enjoyable day			0
' @entity5 , an avid racing fan , moved from the parade ground to the @entity195 to watch the day 's action			1
@entity6 has honoured the @entity5 by re-naming a race to mark the monarch 's 60 - year reign			1
@entity200 , formerly @entity201 , @entity1 , will be run on saturday - the last day of the five - day sporting event			1
the @entity5 has entered one of her own thoroughbreds , @entity205 , for the @entity206 being staged at the meet tomorrow			1
she has owned 63 @entity6 winners so far , 20 of them winning at @entity6			0
off to place a bet : thousands of racegoers are expected to flood through the gates of the @entity21 course today @entity213 ridden by @entity214 wins the @entity215 during day one of the 2012 @entity6 meeting for the many visitors , @entity6 is more than a sporting occasion ; it is also a social and fashion event for the 300,000 spectators who will flock to the @entity21 racecourse this week			0
this year organisers have raised the bar in the sartorial stakes by tightening and clarifying the dress code at the annual summer event , including imposing a ban on fascinators in the royal enclosure			2
the move comes amid criticisms of sartorial standards which have been loosely enforced in recent years , but help will be on hand from a team of specially trained ' dress code assistants '			0
a selection of waistcoats , ties , pashminas and other items will be available at the turnstiles for those who need them			0
in the royal enclosure , fascinators - which are often favoured by the @entity247 - are no longer deemed acceptable			2
women will also be expected to wear skirts or dresses of ' modest length ' which fall just above the knee or longer			0
this clarifies previous guidance which stated miniskirts were ' considered unsuitable '			0
strapless , off the shoulder , halter neck , spaghetti straps and dresses with a strap of less than one inch ( 2.5cm ) are not permitted and midriffs must be covered			0
for men , black or grey morning dress with a waistcoat and tie are now compulsory in this area of the course and cravats will not be allowed			0
a black or grey top hat and black shoes must also be worn			0
in the grandstand , which is open to the public and subject to less stringent rules , a hat or fascinator will be compulsory for women			2
for men , a suit and tie will now be imperative			0
@entity6 's @entity282 , held this year on thursday , will see outlandish and incredible hats worn by female race goers			2
the racecourse is also staging an exhibition titled 60 years of @entity6 during the reign of @entity5 , which will be on display for the duration of the meeting			2
@entity291 , the @entity5 's representative at @entity6 , said : ' @entity6 has a long standing and privileged affiliation with the @entity5 , whose first winner at the event was in 1953 with @entity296 who landed the @entity297			2
' @entity5 has owned no fewer than 63 @entity6 winners , 20 of them at the royal meeting , and it 's always a great thrill for everyone when the royal colours are successful			1
it would be marvellous for that to happen this year and we wish her every success			2

@entity5 last year wore blue on 29 per cent of her public engagements - three times as often as she wore any other colour
