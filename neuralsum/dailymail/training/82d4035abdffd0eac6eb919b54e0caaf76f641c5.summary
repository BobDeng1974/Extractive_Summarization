by @entity0 @entity1 has no doubt @entity3 can stop @entity4 and make it through to only their second @entity6 semi-final in history			1
such has been @entity4 's form in @entity11 that @entity12 have faced accusations of being over-reliant on the @entity15 star , who has scored four of his nation 's seven goals			1
twenty - eight years ago @entity12 were heavily reliant on @entity19 , who scored five goals to help the @entity22 nation to @entity6 glory in @entity24 ' 86			1
a picture taken of six @entity32 surrounding @entity19 is one of the abiding memories of that @entity6 in @entity35			1
@entity3 do not plan to do the same with @entity4 on saturday in @entity37 - coach @entity36 prefers to mark zonally - but defender @entity38 is sure the @entity40 will be strong enough to repel the heir to @entity19 's throne			1
' i think @entity4 has been outstanding so far in this tournament			1
he has been their main man , ' @entity1 told a press conference in @entity37			2
' but if we defend like we did in our previous matches we will stop him , ( @entity50 ) @entity49 , ( @entity51 ) @entity52 and ( @entity54 ) @entity53			0
i 'm convinced of that			0
' the plan to stifle @entity19 in @entity15 worked that night as @entity3 recorded a historic 1 - 0 @entity57 has had no urge at all to remind his players of the events of ' 82 though			1
' we have never spoken about it to any of the players			0
it 's history , ' @entity36 said			2
iconic : six @entity32 defenders work to crowd out @entity19 at the 1982 @entity6 in @entity35 teamwork : @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity38 work to stop @entity69 from shooting @entity3 's recent history has been full of excitement thanks to the emergence of the likes of @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity38 , who operates as a dynamic left - back for his country			1
@entity3 stormed through their qualifying group , dropping just four points in the process			1
but there were question marks as to whether @entity85 could take the individual stars at his disposal and mould them into a united and effective unit at a major tournament			0
so far the @entity3 coach has passed the test with reasonable success			1
@entity3 won every one of their group games and had it not been for a superhuman effort by @entity96 in @entity97 , the @entity40 would have hammered the @entity98 in the last round			2
@entity3 have only made it to the last four once before - in 1986 when @entity19 got his revenge in @entity24 - and @entity38 is desperate for the current team to make history on saturday			1
' we do n't want things to stop , ' @entity1 added			0
' we are ready for the rest			0
we want to play even better			2
' we have been working hard over the last few years and this is the reward for that hard work			0
' top start : @entity3 coach @entity36 has led his side to four wins from four so far step up : despite his country 's good run , @entity75 has had a mixed campaign so far back : @entity116 is set to return for the game against @entity12 although @entity38 sat alongside @entity36 at the pre-match press conference in @entity37 , the @entity119 defender appears to be a doubt for the quarter - final			1
@entity38 , @entity123 and @entity124 were all lacking fitness , according to @entity36 , although it remains to be seen whether he was just trying to sell the @entity126 a dummy			0
' we are not sure ( about those three ) , but we will train today ( on friday ) and see			0
we hope everyone will be fit and ready to go			0
' one thing that seems certain is the return of @entity116 , who is available after recovering from the hamstring injury that kept him out of the @entity134 game			0
for all @entity75 's talents , meanwhile , the @entity136 midfielder has not been at his best in @entity11			2
@entity36 hopes a pep talk he gave him on thursday night will kick the talented 23 - year - old into gear though			2
' i have followed @entity144 for a long time and in the last 18 months he has improved , ' @entity36 said			2
' i talked to him last night and told him how he could improve even more			0
' you will hopefully see a result on the pitch			0

@entity12 set to play @entity3 in @entity6 quarter - final on saturday
@entity4 has scored four of @entity12 's seven goals so far
@entity3 hopeful of *progressing* to the semi-finals for second time ever
@entity19 *famously* stopped by @entity32 defence in 1982
