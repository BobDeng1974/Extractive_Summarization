there was then ' a big bang ' he said , ' and then we looked up and there was blood on the ground '			2

' the @entity6 in @entity7 was constructed in 1936 training : there are thought to have been a further 400 officers from the @entity99 on the ground during the exercise confusion : fireworks had been let off inside the stadium to recreate the atmosphere of a riot , according to some reports wreckage : eyewitness @entity150 said on n - tv television that he saw three helicopters approaching and that the snow on the field was being kicked up by the aircraft , so ' you could n't see a whole lot anymore ' major stadium : a view from inside the stadium taken during the @entity202 the design and construction of the @entity6 in @entity7 was overseen by @entity206 ruler @entity205 , which was the focal point of the @entity43 in 1936			1
@entity167 athletes won more gold medals than any other nation at the tournament , prompting @entity205 to say that when the war was won , every @entity43 would take place in @entity167			2
after the @entity43 @entity205 told @entity214 , an architect and later his armaments minister who worked on the original stadium , to produce blueprints for a new stadium seating 400,000 people			0
despite its modern remodelling , including a roof and moveable seating , the stadium is recognisably the same as that which hosted the @entity227			0
the @entity43 represented the one arena in which @entity205 's ambition to rule victorious over the rest of the civilised world would actually be accomplished , albeit only in the world of athletics			0
the stadium is the biggest and best - preserved example of @entity206 architecture in @entity7 , and was built as an expression of @entity167 might			1
@entity205 opened the @entity43 on august 1 , 1936 , between two tall , imposing stone towers which look like fortified turrets , with the five rings of the @entity43 symbol strung between them			0
that summer 's day , conscious that he cut a rather sorry figure in civilian dress , @entity205 wore his usual brown uniform with a peaked cap , baggy trousers , knee - length leather boots and swastika armband			2
show of strength : a @entity253 meeting in the @entity6 , @entity7 , designed for the 1936 games he walked beneath a 220ft - high stone belltower , its nine - and - a - half - ton bell inscribed , in @entity259 letters , ' i call to the @entity261 '			1
a special truck had pulled it slowly across @entity167 to @entity7 , greeted throughout its journey with military parades , bands and speeches			1
as @entity205 marched slowly between the @entity43 teams gathered just outside on the vast open space of the @entity270 , he was filmed by the camera teams of his favourite director , @entity272			0
from three miles away , loudspeakers positioned along his route had been intoning : ' he is coming			0
' when he entered the stadium and ascended to the @entity276 , or seat of honour , @entity205 was greeted by a sea of swastikas and a thunderous roar of adulation from the capacity crowd of 110,000 people			0
as the national teams marched past , the @entity285 were greeted with a huge ovation for giving the @entity206 salute , while the @entity289 , who refused to give the salute , performing instead a military - style ' eyes right ' , were received almost in silence			0
despite the existence of concentration camps and brutal treatement of @entity300 in @entity167 , with the exception of @entity302 , who were not invited , none of the @entity43 teams chose to boycott @entity205 's games			2
a few individual athletes pulled out , but the prevailing sentiment was summed up by the @entity289 gold medallist sprinter @entity306 , himself @entity300 , who said : ' if the @entity289 team goes to @entity7 , it will be an influence for the good			2
' his was despite the fact that , since 1933 , @entity300 sportsmen and women had been largely excluded from competing , except among themselves			0
under pressure from the @entity315 , the @entity167 unwillingly allowed a couple of @entity300 , both women , to train for the @entity43 , though only one was permitted to participate .			2
