the @entity0 is to allow full funerals for the first time to people who die by suicide			1
the decision sweeps away ecclesiastical laws which for centuries have said suicide is sinful and those who die by their own hand must be denied the complete rites of @entity12 burial			1
the @entity0 ’s parliament , the @entity13 , voted overwhelmingly yesterday to end the ban on funerals for suicides to signal its compassion for the vulnerable			1
synod members also heard that many clergy do give burial services to suicides and have done so for years despite the letter of @entity0 law			0
members of the @entity13 ( pictured ) voted by 262 to five to allow a full burial for those who have committed suicide			1
the practice is thought to be widespread already , despite church law forbidding it church officials said the reform will bring the @entity0 into line with the @entity33 , which abolished the idea that committing suicide was a crime			1
however the move comes at a time of growing political pressure for the legalisation of assisted suicide to allow the desperately disabled or dying help to take their own lives			1
the declaration of a new liberal @entity0 attitude to suicide is likely to be taken as encouragement by activists pushing for the repeal of the 1961 law , which sets down a maximum 14 year jail sentence for anyone who aids and abets a suicide			1
the @entity0 ’s founding @entity53 , which dates from the 16th century , says that the funeral service may not be used ‘ for any that die unbaptized , or excommunicate , or have laid violent hands upon themselves			2
’ suicides were often buried outside a consecrated churchyard or on the north side of the church , without the benefit of the @entity63 burial service			0
current @entity0 law says that a specially adapted funeral service must be used in the case of anyone who has killed themselves who was ‘ of sound mind ’			0
however , few bishops have ever produced such services for their clergy to use			0
@entity78 vicar @entity77 @entity76 told the @entity13 : ‘ we take funerals of murderers , rapists , child abusers and gangsters and we are happy to commit them to mercy of @entity86			1
but not , it seems , suicides			0
' cast out : in the past those who died by suicide were either buried on unconsecrated ground , or on the north side of a church , without a common book of prayer service ( file image ) he said most clergy disregard the law or are surprised to find they are conducting funerals that break the rules			2
‘ passing this motion will be seen as hugely positive pastoral step			0
do we want to be part of church that rejects vulnerable people ? ’ he said			0
@entity107 added in a paper for the @entity13 that the @entity0 law ‘ may lie behind a widespread public perception that suicide is the unforgiveable sin and hence the @entity0 will disapprove			1
‘ there are public memories of real or imagined @entity0 hostility			0
yet pastoral practice has for many years been much more sympathetic and the vast majority of clergy today would wish to minister to the family in every way possible			0
’ the @entity0 has long abandoned any official disapproval of suicide			2
as long ago as 1959 a @entity0 report said that ‘ a person who attempts suicide must be in a state of mental distress and therefore needs special sympathy and understanding			2
’ the @entity13 voted to change @entity0 law by 262 votes to five , with six abstentions			1
senior clergy and officials will now consider how to change the rules			2
they will also consider whether to allow full funerals for people who have not been baptised			0
an assisted suicide law which would allow terminally ill people with six months to live the right to deadly drugs , as long as they are of sound mind and settled on their wish to die , is currently being considered in the @entity143			2
some senior judges have indicated they are in favour of allowing the desperately ill to get help to kill themselves .			0

@entity13 votes 262 to five in favour of changing suicide rules
burials for those who commit suicide already though to be widespread
comes at a time when *campaigners* are pushing for right to die laws
