the prestige of the @entity1 is under renewed threat after it emerged not one third - round match involving a @entity5 team is likely to be played on saturday , january 3			1
confirmation of the blow to @entity1 tradition came after @entity9 and @entity10 revealed that their total of five televised matches , all involving @entity5 teams , would be staged on sunday , monday and — for the first time — tuesday			1
the @entity1 have caved into demands from @entity5 teams , who are playing a full set of fixtures on @entity20 , to play no earlier than the sunday			1
the decision to bow to this pressure means only half the teams in the third - round draw will play on the saturday			0
@entity25 scores last year 's @entity1 final winning goal at @entity27 for @entity28 against @entity29 @entity31 's tie with @entity32 is sure to evoke memories of the famous 1988 @entity1 final @entity9 will show the prestigious clash between @entity31 v @entity32 ( monday ) plus @entity28 v @entity29 ( sunday )			2
@entity10 will feature @entity38 v @entity37 ( sunday ) , @entity39 or @entity41 v @entity40 ( sunday ) and @entity43 v @entity42 ( tuesday )			0
@entity45 ’s clash with @entity46 at @entity47 has also been moved to sunday at 4pm			0
it means the @entity9 ’s flagship highlights programme @entity50 on saturday will probably not show a single team from the @entity5			2
@entity53 's reward for a win over @entity55 is to be shown live against @entity37 on @entity10 @entity56 were one of the stories of the second round , and their third round tie could be first on @entity50 @entity40 's trip to @entity62 or @entity63 will be shown live on @entity10			0
it will be the 43rd time in a row that @entity40 's tie will be shown , a record going back 10 years to a 0 - 0 draw with @entity69			0
@entity70 , who beat @entity72 to reach the third round where they face @entity74 , could be the first team shown on @entity50			0
other @entity5 teams , who are already complaining of exhaustion ahead of the @entity79 schedule , have until early next week to request a change from their original saturday fixtures			1
the @entity1 are unlikely to stand in their way and have made it clear that they intend to take a pragmatic approach to @entity5 teams who would prefer to play on sunday			1
@entity88 's first taste of @entity1 action will come away to lower league opposition , live on @entity10 the @entity1 travelled to the @entity91 this week , where it was surrounded by penguins in the snow @entity28 v @entity29 @entity97 v @entity96 @entity99 v @entity98 @entity101 v @entity100 @entity38 v @entity37 @entity31 v @entity32 @entity103 v @entity104 @entity108 / @entity107 v @entity105 @entity110 v @entity109 @entity70 v @entity74 @entity112 v @entity111 @entity114 v @entity113 @entity116 v @entity115 @entity119 / @entity118 v @entity117 @entity121 v @entity120 @entity123 v @entity122 @entity125 v @entity124 @entity127 v @entity126 @entity129 v @entity128 @entity131 v @entity130 @entity133 v @entity132 @entity135 v @entity134 @entity137 v @entity136 @entity140 / @entity139 v @entity138 @entity43 v @entity42 @entity144 / @entity143 v @entity142 / @entity141 @entity45 v @entity46 @entity147 / @entity146 v @entity145 @entity149 v @entity148 @entity39 / @entity41 v @entity40 @entity152 v @entity151 @entity154 v @entity153 ties to be played across the weekend beginning january 3			2

it is unlikely that any @entity5 teams will play on january 3rd
it is traditional that the @entity1 gets underway on a saturday *afternoon*
all @entity5 teams will play on sunday , monday or tuesday
the @entity1 caved into the team 's demands to play no earlier than sunday , after they play a full set of fixtures on @entity20
