a mother - of - two who once weighed 24 stone and hated her size thought her life would be transformed when she had a gastric wrap to help her slim down			1
but while the weight loss surgery - similar to having a gastric band - did help @entity9 shed 12st , it did n't leave her with the body of her dreams			1
instead the 44 - year - old , who lives in @entity14 , @entity15 , was left with rolls of unsightly saggy skin on her thighs and stomach			1
she 's now 11st 5lb , right , following surgery to have her stomach stapled and other operations to have excess skin removed she told @entity29 : ' my body looked like a deflated balloon			1
i was a fraud as my body in clothes did n't match what was underneath , i hated it			2
' writing in a blog post about her experience , she said she felt ' humiliated ' about her appearance and when she saw herself in the mirror , she thought ' there could not be any possible way to come back to anything remotely normal looking '			2
@entity9 had originally gained weight growing up in @entity47 where she could n't resist sweet treats and fast food			1
she said : ' i was a big child who hid food			2
it was my best friend and worst enemy			0
i went from a fat child to a fatter teenager to a morbidly obese adult			0
' on a typical day , i would skip breakfast			1
then lunch could easily consist of two @entity59 and large fries			0
' dinner was large takeaway or home - cooked massive portions of fat - laden foods			1
snacking on crisps and biscuits in between			0
i was easily consuming 5,000 calories a day			1
' @entity9 hated the saggy skin she was left with on her stomach and thighs after she lost 12st now she has a new body after going under the knife again to have ' several pounds ' of the skin removed @entity9 's intake of calories was more than double the recommended daily amount for a woman so her weight soared to 24st			1
in 2009 when she was 38 years old , she had twins and said becoming a mother made her realise she had to do something to improve her health			1
' i wanted to be an active mum that could run after them			1
i already felt at a disadvantage being an older mum			2
i did n't want to make my life shorter with obesity , ' she explained			0
@entity9 researched her options and decided to travel to the @entity94 for a developing weight loss surgery called a gastric wrap			1
it involves keyhole surgery to stitch the stomach wall to make it smaller so there is less capacity for food			2
it works on the same principle as a gastric bypass but is slightly less invasive as a gastric bypass involves a surgical procedure in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower pouch , and then the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both			0
following the surgery , @entity9 gradually lost weight over the following 18 months			1
the surgery meant she could n't eat as much as she could before and she also started going for more healthy food options			2
she also started exercising as she felt more comfortable running as she became lighter			0
@entity9 , pictured recovering from her skin removal surgery , said the pain was all worth it but while she was gradually becoming healthier , she was left with a constant reminder of her obese past thanks to her saggy excess skin			1
so she decided to go under the knife once again in order to have it removed by cosmetic surgeon @entity126			0
she said : ' the process was done in two stages over three months			0
the recovery was hard as i was covered in staples and stitches			0
but , it was not nearly as bad i thought it would be			0
the pain was worth it			0
through plastic surgery i could have the body i worked so hard to get			2
' like a magic wand being run across my body , the evidence of my obesity was erased			0
mr @entity126 removed several pounds of skin			2
where it had creped , my body is now taut and contoured			2
' @entity9 now weighs 11st 5lb and is happy to show off her figure on her blog as she writes to support other people trying to deal with weight and self - esteem issues			1
she said : ' the new me can run , the new me will live longer and the new me can do anything ! i have been extremely lucky that with the intervention of an amazing surgeon , i could be brand new			0
' now in retrospect looking at my pictures ( when i had saggy skin ) , particularly my thighs and stomach , the results are unbelievable			1
i am not ashamed of those pictures any more			0
it is a bit like looking at a discarded cocoon now			0
' although not perfect , i am very happy with the butterfly i have become no matter how oddly i fly now and then			0
