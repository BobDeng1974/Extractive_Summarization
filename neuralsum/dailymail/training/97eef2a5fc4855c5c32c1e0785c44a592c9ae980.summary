@entity1 welfare minister @entity0 said he could not understand why people go to food banks a @entity1 welfare minister is under fire for claiming it is ‘ very hard to know why ’ people go to food banks			1
lord @entity0 said nobody turned to charities for food parcels ‘ willingly ’ but could not understand what made them need help to feed their families			1
campaigners blame benefits cuts and the impact of the economic crisis for a sharp rise in the number of people using food banks in recent years			1
more than half a million people across @entity26 have turned to food banks to stave off hunger , according to charities			1
ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help			2
cuts to benefits , frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet			0
during a debate in the @entity46 , peers heard how changes to the welfare system meant more families were turning to food banks			1
@entity52 ’s @entity51 of @entity53 urged the government to estimate the ‘ cost to family relationships of cuts to social security , which are forcing some families to move , breaking up their family and social relationships , and the cost to them of ever increasing punitive sanctions , which are driving more and more families to food banks ’			2
she added : ‘ both these trends are leaving families under more and more stress , leading , potentially , to the break - up of relationships			0
’ but lord @entity0 said the rise in demand for food banks was difficult to understand			1
‘ clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly , ’ he said			1
‘ however , it is very hard to know why people go to them			0
’ charities argue that cuts to benefits and increasing use of sanctions mean more people have had to turn to food banks to feed their families he pointed to a recent report by the @entity89 which showed there was a lack of systematic peer - reviewed research from the @entity26 on the reasons or immediate circumstances that lead people to turn to food aid			1
but @entity98 , chairman of the @entity99 which runs 420 food banks , told the @entity101 : ‘ i 'm mystified by his remarks			2
we 've kept statistics for the 14 years we 've run food banks			0
‘ this gives a powerful answer why people are in need of them			0
it 's related to benefit changes and low incomes			0
’ the @entity99 says 347,000 people used its food banks in december , compared with 26,000 a month five years ago			2
last year @entity1 education secretary @entity116 sparked outrage when he claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks because of their own ‘ decisions ’ , he suggested that many cash - strapped families have brought their problems on themselves			2
he added : ‘ i appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures			0
‘ those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances			0
‘ we need to ensure that support is not just financial , and that the right decisions are made			0
