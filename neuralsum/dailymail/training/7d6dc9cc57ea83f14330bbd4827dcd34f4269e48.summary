after showing pictures where @entity26 looked ' bootilicious ' before having hundreds of the illegal injections , @entity22 asked the 30 - year - old why she had wanted to change her body shape			1
regrets : @entity31 appeared on this morning to show @entity21 and @entity22 how injections and then silicone implants have left her with a disproportionately large bottom @entity35 : the 30 - year - old told the amazed presenters she become obsessed with making her bum bigger when she worked as a dancer ' this size was not my goal ' : @entity26 said the illegal injections gave her an infection which meant she had to have silicone implants so her bottom did n't look lumpy @entity26 admitted it had become an obsession as she felt she had to compete against other women in her job as a dancer			1
she said : ' when i heard about butt injections i thought it sounded stupid but after a year in that environment as a dancer , everyone was doing it , it was n't such a foreign concept			2
i thought i might as well try it			0
' then it became a competition - not for men but against other women			2
so many of us were doing it because we wanted to better than the other person			0
' do n't do it : @entity26 wanted to share her story to warn other women against having illegal injections			1
she said she was lucky just to get an infection but other women have been killed as they did n't even know what they were being injected with @entity26 revealed each procedure involved at least nine injections in each cheek			1
she described how the injections felt like being struck by lightning and that they could often leak but this did n't deter her			2
she admitted after the first treatment she did n't even know what she had been injected with			2
' the first time i went for injections i did n't know what she used			2
she said it was soya bean oil but after doing my research , i do n't believe her , ' she said			0
@entity26 developed an infection as a result of the illegal injections but even this did n't make her stop having them			1
however , she explained it then meant she had to have silicone implants as the infection had left her bottom looking like ' a sack of oranges '			1
she explained : ' it did become addictive but it got infected so i was left with lumps			0
so i had a choice , i could have a medium - sized lumpy butt or keep padding it with silicone to make it better			0
so it was n't my goal to get this big but padding it with silicone is how this happened			2
' before : after seeing these pictures of @entity26 before her injections , @entity22 asked the mother - of - two why she wanted to change herself			0
she said it was thanks to competition with other women in her job as a dancer @entity21 asked @entity26 to stand up from the @entity130 sofa to reveal just how large her bottom is now			2
' that 's quite a curve , ' he commented			0
@entity26 admitted she is n't happy with her size but she has learnt to live with it because surgery to reverse it would be too risky			2
she added that in light of learning of women who have been killed after having the injections , she is now just happy to be alive			1
she said : ' truthfully i would like smaller butt but i 'm happy i did n't die and still here for my children			0
i did so much dumb stuff with my body i 'm lucky that i 'm still living			0
when i look in the mirror , i think i would like a smaller butt , it 's hard to go shopping , but i 'm just happy i 'm still here			0
' standing in the corridor of the @entity130 studios , @entity26 shows how the hip injections have also altered her body shape these close - ups reveal just how dramatically her figure has been changed as a result of injections and implants @entity26 realises that she has been one of the lucky ones after reading reports of women dying who had been injected with @entity167 sealant and even cement			1
she is also aware of just how popular the injections are having worked as an assistant to a black market practitioner , who treated women as varied as a 17 - year - old brought in by her proud mother and pensioner in her seventies			0
it was this job that gave her the wake - up call she needed to stop having the injections herself , as she was faced with jail for being involved in the illegal practice			1
speaking out : @entity26 hopes her experience will deter other women from having illegal butt injections she said : ' having the infection did n't make me stop			1
it was only when i was faced with jail and being away from my kids			0
' @entity26 is no longer a dancer and has n't had injections since may 2011			0
she now says she wants to dedicate her life to warning others of the dangers of having illegal injections			1
she has written a book , @entity201 , which charts her own experience of having illegal injections and warns against following her example			1

you can get implants but injections made freely into your butt is not legal in any sense of the word , ' she said .			0
