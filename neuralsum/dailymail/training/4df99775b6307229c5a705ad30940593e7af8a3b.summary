by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:30 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:39 est , 11 december 2013 an overweight nurse claimed her £ 10,000 @entity5 gastric band made her sick , so she had it loosened – only to balloon to nearly her original weight			1
@entity8 , 26 , said the band ‘ ruined her life ’ after she dropped half her bodyweight to 12st , then quickly piled most of it back on			1
miss @entity8 was once 24st and a size 24 and would gorge on 12 packs of @entity15 and 600g chocolate bars for breakfast			1
@entity8 ( right ) before her gastric band when her diet consisted of crisps , takeaways and chocolate			1
at her heaviest , she weighed 24st and was a size 24 ms @entity8 's trim figure after the £ 10,000 @entity5 - funded gastric band op ( left ) and today ( right )			1
she has now gained weight after the band was loosened for medical reasons and she began eating more she had surgery in december 2010 , and lost a dramatic 12st in the next year , going to a size ten			1
however , she said she spent months in pain , always hungry but unable to keep food down			0
with the gastric band in place , her appetite should have decreased significantly , but miss @entity8 claims that she noticed no difference			1
in march 2012 , doctors slightly loosened the band , which is designed to reduce the size of the stomach and limit food intake			1
today , ms @entity8 has yo - yoed back to an unhealthy 20 stone - almost the same weight as she was when she first underwent the operation she stopped being sick – but started to gain weight , and has now reached 20st			1
she is also back on virtually the same diet of pizzas and chips			0
miss @entity8 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , said people should think twice about gastric bands			2
she said : ‘ it has been a horror story from the start			0
dr @entity57 , consultant batriatric surgeon at the @entity58 told @entity59 that it was ' very rare ' for gastric bands to fail in this fashion			2
he said : ' they are one of the safest operations			0
of the 2,100 operations carried out each year , the complication rate is only 0.09 per cent , according to the @entity66			0
' as well as the silicone plastic ring that is the gastric band , there is also a balloon inside it that determines the tightness - depending on how much liquid is in it			1
dr @entity57 said : ' i can only imagine some liquid was taken out of the band to loosen it before gallbladder surgery - although there is no reason for this - and the correct tightness has never been achieved again since			1
' he added there was no reason why having gallstones or the gallbladder removed should affect the outcome of the surgery			1
‘ instead of never feeling hungry , now i never feel full			0
i would go to a buffet and just eat everything , i would just keep going back			0
’ the mental health nurse claims the surgery is not effective and says people should ‘ do things the natural way by going to the gym and eating the right foods ’			0
she said : ‘ i want to appeal to everyone not to have a gastric band , even if it is offered to you for free on the @entity5 , because it has ruined my life and could ruin other people ’s			1
’ miss @entity8 had surgery at @entity105 in @entity52 after being diagnosed with gallstones , which could only be removed if she lost weight			1
she began eating healthy chicken and vegetables and went to the gym five times a week			0
but doctors feared the band was not working and tightened it eight times , until she slimmed to 12st by january last year			2
however , she claims the weight only came off because the tight band made her constantly unwell			2
she said : ‘ i could n’t keep anything down , i was being sick all the time , it was awful			0
‘ every six weeks the band was re-tightened			0
’ ms @entity8 ( before surgery ) is now warning others to think twice about having gastric bands fitted			1
she said ' it has been a horror story from the start and it has ruined by life ' in march last year , the band was loosened because she felt so ill – triggering rapid weight gain			2
‘ because i had been so deprived of food i suddenly rebelled and literally could n’t stop eating , ’ miss @entity8 said			2
‘ i started to load back up on fatty cakes and greasy chips and in the end i was eating more than i was before surgery			0
‘ before long my new size ten clothes were way too tight			0
i realised the gorging had to stop , but the fatter i got the more i comfort ate			0
the doctors said this has happened before but it is rare			0
i stopped going to the gym and put all the weight back on and now i weigh 20st			2
’ dr @entity144 , a @entity145 , said : ‘ gastric bands can often be an effective means of losing weight , but there is much additional work to be done in terms of counselling to make sure that there is psychological support in place afterwards			2
‘ not being her doctor it is difficult to pinpoint what has gone wrong in this individual case			0

@entity8 , 26 , weighed 24 stone and was a size 24 before the surgery
diagnosed with gallstones and told to lose weight so they could be removed
had a £ 10,000 gastric band operation on the @entity5 in december 2010
then shed *7st* in seven months and eventually slimmed down to 12st
then had gallbladder removed and developed *problems* with gastric band
had to be loosened - and as it was , she began to eat more and not exercise
has now put on *8st* and says band was ' worst *decision* ' she ever made
