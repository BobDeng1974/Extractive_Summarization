scientists in @entity1 believe they have identified a drug which could help people suffering binge eating disorder , which often leads to obesity a drug used to treat @entity10 could be used to curb binge eating , scientists revealed today			1
binge eating disorder is when a person feels compelled to overeat on a regular basis			2
it first develops in young adults , with the @entity17 estimating there is around a one in 30 to one in 50 chance of a person developing the disorder at some point during their life			0
though similar to bulimia , it differs because sufferers are not compelled to purge the food they have eaten			0
instead many people with the condition become obese , while others attempt to limit weight gain by fasting			0
most patients diagnosed with the condition are treated via psychological or psychiatric therapy , self - help programmes and support groups			0
now scientists at the @entity40 in @entity1 have identified a drug , originally approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , which also reduces the urge to eat			1
they discovered that at certain doses lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was effective			1
there are currently no approved drugs to treat the eating disorder			1
dr @entity50 and her team compared the drug with placebo in 514 adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder during a random clinical trial from may 2011 to january 2012			2
the medication was administered in dosages of 30 , 50 or 70 mg / day or placebo			0
the study found the two higher doses reduced the number of days each week that people were compelled to binge eat			1
but the research team discovered the low dose had no effect			0
their findings also indicate the percentage of patients who managed to stop binge eating for four weeks was lower with the placebo group ( 21.3 per cent ) , compared with the 50 - mg / d group ( 42.2 per cent ) , and the 70 - mg / d ( 50 per cent )			1
dr @entity50 said : ' in the primary analysis of this study of adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder , lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment with 50 and 70 mg / d , but not 30 mg / d , demonstrated a significant decrease , compared with placebo , in weekly binge eating days per week at week 11			1
' similarly , binge eating episodes decreased in the 50 - and 70 - mg / d treatment groups			2
' the one - week binge eating episode response status was improved in the 50 - and 70 - mg / d treatment groups , and a greater proportion of participants achieved four - week cessation of binge eating episodes and global improvement of symptom severity with all lisdexamfetamine dosages			2
' confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe binge eating disorder			0
' the study was published online in the journal @entity102			0
the drug lisdexamefetamine dimesylate is currently approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder			1

lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is approved to treat @entity10
but scientists in @entity1 have found it can help curb the desire to eat
certain amount of drug helped binge eaters stop gorging for four weeks
