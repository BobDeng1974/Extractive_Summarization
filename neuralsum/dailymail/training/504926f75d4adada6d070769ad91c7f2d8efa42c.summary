after 15 months in orbit the @entity1 ’s highly secret unmanned space plane successfully touched down yesterday , and it ’s highly anticipated landing was caught on film			1
the military 's unmanned @entity6 robotic space shuttle returned from orbit at 5:48 a.m. in @entity9 from a secretive test flight			1
and now officials from the @entity12 have released a short video of the smooth landing			0
the first part of the 1.17 minute video , which captured the plane ’s final descent , is shot in infrared light			2
after the plane touches down the film switches out of the infrared light , showing the shuttle in good shape after its mysterious mission			1
the miniature space plane touched down at @entity9 's @entity12 , 130 miles northwest of @entity28			1
it was only the second @entity44 vehicle to make an autonomous runway landing from space			2
the space plane , also known as @entity48 - 2 , or @entity49 , fired its engine to slip out of orbit , then pierced through the atmosphere and glided down the runway - just as an ordinary airplane would			1
' with the retirement of the space shuttle fleet , the @entity55 program brings a singular capability to space technology development , ' said lieutenant colonel @entity60 , @entity6 program manager			1
' the return capability allows the @entity1 to test new technologies without the same risk commitment faced by other programs			0
we 're proud of the entire team 's successful efforts to bring this mission to an outstanding conclusion			2
' the military 's first @entity6 debuted in 2010 and autonomously landed at @entity12 after 224 days in space			1
smooth landing : the unmanned @entity1 space plane steered itself to a landing early saturday capping a 15 - month clandestine mission returned : the space plane , also known as @entity48 - 2 , or @entity49 , fired its engine to slip out of orbit , then pierced through the atmosphere and glided down the runway like an airplane would @entity82 this computer image shows the space plane re-entering @entity85			1
although it resembles a small space shuttle it is not designed to carry humans			2
it 's wingspan is a mere 4.5m with a length of 8.9m			0
it is powered by batteries and solar cells the @entity99 's @entity98 space shuttle , which made a single spaceflight in 1988 , was the first ship to make an autonomous landing from orbit			2
the military will not disclose what @entity49 was doing during its 15 months in orbit , but a third mission already is on the calendar for launch this fall			0
@entity49 blasted off aboard an unmanned @entity111 rocket from @entity112 on march 5 , 2011			0
at launch , the space plane was accompanied by staff in biohazard suits , leading to speculation that there were radioactive components on board			1
@entity120 built two of the robotic space planes , which resemble diminutive space shuttle orbiters , as test vehicles			2
the military , which took over the program from @entity127 , says it is using them to learn how to quickly and inexpensively refurbish reusable spaceships for flight			0
however , the ultimate purpose of the mission has largely remained a mystery			0
questions : the unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the @entity1 - but its purpose has never fully been explained finishing touches : scientists in protective suits inspect the solar - powered craft prior to its mission the top - secret robot plane is expected to land saturday - weather and technical issues permitting the @entity148 also serve as orbital test beds for instruments that could be incorporated into future satellites			1
it is not known if it carried anything in its cargo bay , which is about the size of a pickup truck bed			0
the vehicles look like miniature versions of @entity127 's now - retired space shuttle orbiters , with a similar shape and a payload bay for cargo and experiments			0
they are 8.9 metres long , compared to the shuttle 's 37 - metre length , and have a wingspan of 4.5 metres , compared to the shuttle 's wingspan of 23.7 meters			0
the solar - operated vehicles were designed to stay in orbit for up to 270 days			0
@entity49 surpassed that milestone by 199 days			0
keeping watch : an artist 's rendition of the @entity6 shuttle orbiting the @entity85 the @entity6 due to fly this fall is the vehicle that inaugurated the program in 2010 , ' however , many skeptics think that the vehicle 's mission is defence or spy - related			1
there are rumours circulating that the craft was kept in space longer than initially intended to spy on the new @entity191 space station , @entity192			0
however , analysts have pointed out that surveillance would be tricky , since the spacecraft would rush past each other at thousands of metres per second			0
and @entity197 , from the @entity198 , pointed out to the @entity199 : ‘ if the @entity44 really wanted to observe @entity192 , it has enough assets to do that without using @entity6			2
’ lift off : the @entity6 sits on top of an @entity111 rocket as it 's launched at @entity112 in @entity204 in 2010 ready for launch : the @entity6 rocket in @entity204 before it blasted off into space mystery : scientists work on a prototype for the rocket prior to its launch last may , amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first @entity6 which included flyovers of @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 , heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance			1
other industry analysts have speculated that the @entity1 is just making use of the @entity6 ’s amazing fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts			1
after all , under budget cuts for 2013 to 2017 proposed by the @entity234 administration , the office that developed the @entity6 will be shut down			2
according to @entity6 manufacturer @entity120 , the space plane operates in low - earth orbit , between 110 and 500 miles above earth			1
by comparison , the @entity238 orbits at about 220 miles			0
