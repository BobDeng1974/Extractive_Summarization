in the end it took a @entity2 to end this utterly absorbing stand - off , the irrepressible , if rather unimpressive , @entity5 scoring the goal that ended almost 180 minutes of deadlock between these fierce city rivals			1
only here on loan from @entity12 for a season , it was a goal that means @entity5 will be adored at the @entity14 long after he has gone			1
but it was also a reward for ambition over the more conservative approach of @entity19 and his well - drilled side ; for the team that enjoyed twice as much of the ball and the better of the chances that were created in this tense , niggly @entity25 quarter - final tie			1
@entity5 scores the only goal of the two legs in the @entity25 quarter - final between the @entity30 neighbours @entity5 runs away to celebrate his goal as @entity30 were finally beaten after almost two full matches against @entity33 @entity5 celebrates as he became the hero for @entity33 late on during the @entity25 quarter - final second leg @entity5 runs away in celebration after scoring the only goal in 180 minutes between the sides to settle the two - legged derby @entity5 slides on his knees to celebrate putting @entity33 into the semi-finals of @entity43 's elite competition at the @entity44 @entity45 joins in with the celebrations at the @entity44 as @entity5 sneaked the winner against their neighbouring rivals @entity45 clenches his fists as he celebrates his side taking an all - important lead against their neighbours @entity30 @entity55 is sent off by @entity57 referee @entity56 in the 76th minute as @entity30 were forced to play with 10 men @entity30 players protest the second yellow card shown to @entity61 which left the visitors up against it at the @entity44 @entity55 receives a pat on the back of the head by @entity33 's @entity67 after the @entity69 international was sent off @entity33 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity70 6 ; @entity71 6 , @entity72 6.5 , @entity73 6 , @entity67 6 ; @entity74 6.5 , @entity75 8 , @entity76 7 ; @entity77 7 , @entity5 6 , @entity45 6 subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 booked : @entity72 , @entity82 scorers : @entity5 ( 88 ) manager : @entity86 @entity30 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity87 8 ; @entity88 6.5 , @entity89 7 , @entity90 7 , @entity91 7 ; @entity55 5 , @entity92 6.5 , @entity93 7 , @entity94 6 ( @entity95 46 6 ) ; @entity96 6.5 ( @entity97 65 6 ) , @entity98 6 subs not used : @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 booked : @entity55 , @entity97 , @entity93 sent off : @entity55 ( 76 ) manager : @entity19 referee : @entity56 ( @entity106 ) 8 man of the match : @entity75 it was hard to see what @entity30 were trying to achieve at times			1
a victory on penalties perhaps			0
but when @entity55 was dismissed in the 75th minute for what looked like a harsh second yellow card for a challenge on the all - too theatrical @entity74 , an opportunity suddenly presented itself to @entity33			1
a frustrated figure until @entity30 were reduced to 10 men , @entity45 made a jinking , purposeful run into the penalty area before executing the all - important pass			1
@entity5 had missed his earlier chances			2
one of them a clear cut opening thanks to a wonderful reverse - pass from @entity76			0
but this time he delivered , the @entity128 scoring arguably the biggest goal of his career with a sweeping effort from 12 yards			0
in the starting line - up only because of an injury to @entity134 , @entity5 performed much as he has all season here			1
committed and energetic but just lacking the class of his temporary club - mates			0
but with this contest only two minutes from moving into extra-time , goalless if far from gutless , @entity5 made no mistake when it mattered most			1
@entity86 seems to beat @entity30 when it matters most			2
in last year ’s @entity25 final			2
seven times already this season these two teams had met and seven times @entity33 had failed to conquer their less glamorous neighbours			2
but there is a reason why @entity86 is the only living manager to have lifted the @entity25 on three occasions , and today he is a significant step closer to winning the greatest club competition of all for an unprecedented fourth time			2
it might even secure his position at the @entity44 , given how uncertain his future appears to be despite delivering @entity156 last season			2
‘ every game is an exam and tonight we passed the exam well , ’ said the amiable @entity158 with his trademark chuckle			0
what an extraordinary night it had been			0
as early as two hours before kick - off the streets around this magnificent stadium were packed with people , their rhythmic chanting rivalled only by the hum of the police helicopters hovering overhead			0
@entity25 nights between two teams from the same country have this special quality			2
rarely has an atmosphere been greater in @entity178 football than when @entity179 travelled to @entity180 for that first semi-final back in 2005			0
@entity33 striker @entity5 had been having a frustrating evening for @entity33 up until his goal in the 88th minute @entity5 could n't quite believe how he missed his chance to give @entity33 the all - important lead at the @entity44 before his goal @entity5 's starting place for @entity33 was described by local media as the ' biggest match of his career ' and he lived up to it but this was extra special			1
this was a @entity30 derby with a difference and the deafening roar that greeted the end of the @entity25 anthem said as much			1
you could barely hear yourself think never mind what the person sat next to you was saying , and it was no different when @entity55 was dismissed and when @entity5 then struck the decisive blow			1
for @entity86 it must have come as something of a relief after the tactical juggling he had to perform in the absence of key personnel			0
as well as @entity134 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 were also missing and the decision to deploy @entity74 in midfield caused some concern here			0
after all , only once before had the @entity158 tried it and after losing 2 - 1 to @entity216 he admitted to making a mistake			0
afterwards he laughed about it too , joking that attempts to kill him last time had proved unsuccessful so he felt safe doing it again			0
this game quickly followed a familiar theme , with @entity33 pressing deep in the half of the well - drilled @entity30			1
@entity19 , simmering and animated on the sidelines , applauded his players for the naughty challenges as well as the good ones , seemingly happy to see his side play so negatively			0
@entity33 defender @entity74 sends a powerful header towards goal but is unable to give his team the lead at the @entity44 @entity74 tries to encourage the crowd to make more noise at the @entity44 as @entity33 tried to break the deadlock @entity74 goes down holding his face during the @entity30 derby at the @entity44 for the @entity25 quarter - final second leg @entity74 holds his face as @entity57 referee @entity56 approaches to figure out what is wrong with the @entity243 defender but the chances would come for @entity33 , with @entity45 forcing a fine save from the impressive @entity246 just before the break and @entity5 failing to capitalise on that delightful ball from @entity76 just after the restart			1
only when @entity55 was dismissed did the breakthrough come , however , @entity45 and @entity5 exploiting the slight tactical change @entity19 had been forced to make as a result of the red card			1
@entity30 ’s manager said he had no regrets			0
‘ i am proud of my players , ’ he said			0
‘ but congratulations to our rivals , who played a good game and scored a beautiful goal			2
a triumph for the beautiful game too			0
