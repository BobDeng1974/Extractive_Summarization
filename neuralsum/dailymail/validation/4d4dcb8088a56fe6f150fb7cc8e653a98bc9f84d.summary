before getting married next week , there are a couple of things @entity3 would like to achieve in his last tournament as a single man			1
the immediate goal is to pass the milestone of 500 career victories — he is within one win of doing so after beating @entity11 ’s @entity10 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in the third round of the @entity13			1
@entity3 can pass the mark on tuesday if he defuses the huge serving power of giant @entity17 @entity16			1
@entity3 could become the first @entity19 tennis player to win 500 career games if he beats @entity16 should @entity3 survive that encounter , it is possible he could edge ahead of @entity23 and move back up to no 3 in the world rankings , although that also depends on the performances of others here			1
going past 500 is something nobody can take away from him , however , and it will stand as testament to his consistency at the top of the game			0
since tennis went open in 1968 — the old barriers between amateurs and professionals torn down to make a unified circuit — only 45 men have clocked that many wins			0
only eight who are currently active have managed it			0
@entity43 of @entity44 in their third round match during the @entity13 no @entity19 player in that time has got there , @entity47 pulling stumps on his career within four of the mark			1
@entity3 said : ‘ it ’s nice because when you see the list of players who have won this many matches there are n’t loads			1
‘ even if it does n’t happen here then at some stage i ’m sure i will get there			0
@entity3 could leap ahead of @entity23 in the rankings if he beats @entity16 in the fourth round ‘ i obviously want to win more and hopefully i still have quite a few years ahead of me to add to that number			1
‘ it ’s not easy in this era to win that many matches , so it ’s a good sign			0
’ of those @entity3 victories , 24 have come so far at this event , making it his most productive masters level tournament			1
@entity3 and @entity10 shake hands after their match which saw the @entity76 progress to the next round factors like it being a familiar training base for @entity3 — he has a home only three miles away from this @entity82 island site — and the tendency for it to be windy during the tournament have all contributed to that			2
he is one of the best at adapting to such conditions			0
after two days of unsettled weather that have hardly enhanced @entity91 ’s reputation for reliable sunshine , it was a regulation glorious morning as he kicked off the programme against @entity10 , one of the steady trickle of decent tennis players who come out of @entity11			0
the no 27 seed , who beat @entity3 in their previous meeting on the clay of @entity100 last year , is the kind of opponent who illustrates that racking up the wins on the @entity105 is hardly a straightforward endeavour			2
@entity3 's form is improving as the season continues and he looks in good shape for @entity110 he gives the ball an almighty biff from the back court but was slowly unpicked by @entity3 ’s clever mix of angles and spins			2
the @entity76 definitely looks a better player than he did a year ago , although the tendency towards the odd lapse in concentration is still evident			0
he let the @entity121 , as usual enjoying good support in this part of the world , creep back from 5 - 1 down in the second set but then served it out at the second time of asking			0
@entity3 is set to marry long - term partner @entity127 ( right ) next week following the tournament in @entity129			2

@entity3 is one win away from a total of 500 in his career victories
the @entity135 could do it against @entity16 in the @entity13
@entity3 can become the first ever @entity138 to pass the *impressive* *landmark*
