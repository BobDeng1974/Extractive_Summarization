by @entity0 the man behind @entity3 's maps software has been sacked in a major restructuring of the computer giant 's executives after he refused to apologise for its @entity8 software			1
@entity11 , a long - time lieutenant of late @entity3 co-founder @entity12 , was asked to leave following years of friction with other top executives and his recent refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of the @entity3 's much - criticized mapping software , people familiar with the situation said			1
sources said @entity11 refused to sign a public apology after @entity3 's mapping product , which displaced the popular @entity22 on the @entity23 and the @entity24 in september , contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce criticism			1
@entity11 was asked to leave @entity3 after reports he refused to take responsibility for its map debacle instead , ceo @entity30 signed the letter last month			1
@entity11 will leave the company next year , @entity3 said in a statement			1
it also confirmed that @entity34 , who was hired as the company 's retail chief just seven months ago after serving as ceo of @entity40 electronics retailer @entity38 's , will also leave @entity3			1
the @entity40 executive was mr @entity30 's first major appointment and , when his recruitment was announced in january , said that mr @entity34 had a commitment to customer service " ' like no one else we 've met			1
' mr @entity34 , who relocated to @entity48 in april for the job , was awarded a $ 56m ( £ 36m ) ' golden hello ' for joining @entity3			1
the payment , due to be made over five years , dwarfed the £ 1m pay package he collected for running @entity53			0
his efforts to improve profits at the stores had alienated employees and sources close to @entity3 said @entity30 had concluded he was simply the wrong person for the job			0
' these changes show that @entity30 is stamping his authority on the business , ' said @entity63 , analyst with @entity64 , said			0
' perhaps disappointed with the @entity8 issues , @entity11 became the scapegoat			1
' a retail high - flier credited with reviving the fortunes of @entity69 and @entity70 , former @entity53 boss @entity34 today left the technology giant in a shock exit that comes after he joined in april to head up its global store chain			1
mr @entity34 relocated to @entity48 and was reportedly awarded a " golden hello " package worth up to 56 million @entity75 dollars ( £ 36 million ) to drive expansion of @entity3 's shop portfolio as senior vice president of retail			1
he was seen as being one of @entity3 chief executive @entity30 's key hires and was described by him at the time as having commitment to customer service " like no one else we 've met "			0
but it is understood mr @entity34 , who joined @entity53 at the end of 2007 and overhauled the business following a period of under - performance , caused a backlash among employees by trying to cut back hours and staff numbers , before the group quickly reversed the changes			2
the executive changes are the biggest at @entity3 in more than a decade , and mark the first major move by @entity30 to shape his own management team since @entity12 ' death a year ago			0
while @entity3 has enjoyed enormous success since @entity30 took the helm , recent stumbles including the @entity8 debacle and several earnings disappointments have underscored the long - term challenges the company faces in retaining its dominance in the smartphone and tablet markets			0
in @entity115 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , @entity3 faces an array of powerful competitors who are determined to own a piece of the exploding mobile - computing market			0
' competition is moving much faster to be more @entity3 - like , ' said @entity121 , president of technology research and consulting firm @entity122			0
the executive changes hand substantially more responsibility to sir @entity127 , @entity3 's celebrated industrial design chief , who will now oversee both hardware and software design			1
sir @entity127 : the @entity40 born designer now oversees the look and feel of @entity3 's hardware and software @entity136 , a long - serving executive who runs online products , will take charge of @entity8 and the @entity140 voice search software			1
@entity141 , who oversees the osx software that powers the @entity145 computers , will take charge of the @entity148 software			0
putting the mobile and personal computer software teams together under @entity141 could improve operations within the company , particularly as the capabilities and features of smartphones and pcs increasingly converge , said analysts			0
@entity127 , now responsible for design across all products , has played a key role in @entity3 's success by imbuing its gadgets with a distinct look and feel			2
@entity165 analyst @entity164 said @entity127 could now help reinvigorate the look of @entity3 's software , which has been slow to evolve			1
' if you have two different heads , you have two different fiefdoms , ' he said			0
the retail stores will report directly to @entity30 while a search is conducted for a new head of the division			0
shares of @entity3 , the world 's largest publicly traded company by market value , have declined 14 percent in the past month since reaching a 52 - week high of $ 705.07 in september			0
@entity3 's maps was plagued with problems people with knowledge of @entity3 's inner workings said @entity11 's departure was years in the making , and came to a head with the @entity8 incident			1
a 15 - year veteran of the company , @entity11 was once considered a possible ceo candidate and is credited with playing a central role in making the @entity23 and the @entity24 two of the most successful consumer electronics products ever			2
but @entity11 was also considered a hard person to work with , and he alienated other senior executives with his abrasive style , one person familiar with the situation said			2
this person added that once @entity12 passed away , @entity11 was left with few defenders at the top of the company			2
the fate of the executive , who had 1,000 people directly reporting to him , was sealed by the @entity8 debacle			0
even after a public uproar over the shortcomings and widespread calls for @entity3 to revert to @entity22 , @entity11 would not acknowledge the gravity of the problem , a source with knowledge of the matter said			2
@entity11 instead likened the situation to the complaints over the antenna in an earlier @entity23 and insisted it would blow over without a public mea culpa , the source said			2
but @entity30 disagreed , and issued a public apology with his own signature on it after @entity222 would not go along , the source added			0
@entity3 described monday 's moves as a way to increase ' collaboration ' across its hardware , software and services business			2
@entity11 will serve as an advisor to @entity30 until his departure .			0
