by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:21 pm on 29th june 2011 as excuses for bad performance go , it 's up there with the classics			1
but whether it will be enough to satisfy one of the world 's most notorious dictators is another matter			2
@entity13 coach @entity12 last night blamed the defeat of his women 's world cup soccer team by the @entity16 on fact that five of his players were struck by lightning			1
he claimed some of them were hospitalised with electrocution after a training match almost three weeks earlier			2
and @entity12 has all the more reason to come up with a convincing excuse - his men 's team counterpart was sentenced to hard labour after he came home from the @entity31 having lost all three games			1
victory : the @entity16 team celebrates their victory against @entity36 during their @entity38 soccer match in @entity39 things are looking bleak : @entity13 players @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 left , leave the pitch after losing the match as coach @entity12 , right , looks on @entity48 was then particularly displeased with a 7 - 0 thrashing by @entity50			1
but @entity12 told a press conference after the game last night : ' when we stayed in @entity55 during training our players were hit by lightning , and more than five of them were hospitalised			2
' ' some stayed in hospital and then came to @entity59 later than the rest of us			2
' the goalkeeper and the four defenders were most affected , and some midfielders as well			0
the physicians said the players were not capable of participating in the tournament			0
' but @entity69 football is the most important and significant event for a footballer , so they do nâ€™t want to think about anything but football			0
way to go : the @entity16 team celebrate after @entity75 scored the opening goal scoring the opening goal during the @entity79 match back of the net : @entity36 goalkeeper @entity81 looks on as @entity16 ' @entity82 scores her side 's second goal write caption here ' the fact that they played could be called abnormal , the result of very strong will			0
' @entity90 and @entity82 scored in the second half of the match to secure victory in their opening @entity69 game			0
@entity95 scored in the 54th minute , taking a long cross from @entity97 right in front of the box and nodding the ball past goalkeeper @entity81 to set off a raucous celebration by the two - time @entity69 champions			1
@entity82 hit the second goal of her career with a strike from 11 yards in the 76th minute			0
@entity81 dived , but the ball rolled beneath her outstretched hand			0
final whistle : the @entity16 substitutes celebrate winning the match against @entity36 celebrations : goalkeeper @entity112 smiles , left , as @entity82 celebrates after scoring the 2 - 0 with teammates @entity113 and @entity115 , right when the final whistle sounded , the @entity16 reserves ran onto the field to celebrate while the @entity13 stood just beyond midfield , watching			1
it was the fourth straight time the teams had met in group play at the @entity69 , and the @entity16 have won all but one of the @entity124 , the victory is n't likely to end the questions about the @entity16 , who have been uncharacteristically inconsistent lately			0
after going more than two years without a loss , they dropped three games in five months , and looked decidedly unsettled against the @entity13 for much of the first half			1
' it 's always good going forward , ' @entity16 coach @entity131 said			1
' two great goals , and we 're moving on			0
' the @entity13 outfit already have a mountain to climb in @entity38 , grouped with hotly - tipped @entity137 as well as the @entity16 and @entity138			1
they are also the youngest team in the tournament with only two of their squad boasting @entity69 experience , and just five have made more than 10 appearances with the senior national team .			0

last @entity13 coach to under - perform was sentenced to hard labour
