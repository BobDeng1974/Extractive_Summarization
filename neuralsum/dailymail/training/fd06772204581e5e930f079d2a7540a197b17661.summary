@entity0 makes his @entity3 @entity2 debut with a staggering £ 40million price tag hung on his head by @entity6			1
@entity7 thought they had a deal cued up at around £ 30million to take the prodigious teenage left back to @entity9 to begin @entity11 's rebuilding task			1
@entity0 , who celebrates his 19th birthday in two weeks time , was also wanted by @entity25 after an outstanding season for @entity6 but they were put off by the likely transfer fee even before @entity18 took charge			1
now @entity7 , anxious to make a statement in the transfer market after failing to qualify for the @entity31 for the first time since 1995 , will have to decide how to react to @entity6 demands			2
team talk : @entity3 's manager @entity35 with the players on monday @entity18 has already seen centre forward @entity37 leave for @entity38 , who are also chasing new @entity3 star @entity40 , while centre - half @entity41 has put in a transfer request			0
and he 's demanded @entity6 play hardball over any other sales as the country 's big clubs try to pick over their best players			0
for all @entity0 's talent it is an astonishing price to ask for a left back who is still learning his trade , and has yet to play a competitive international			1
call up : @entity0 and @entity55 will get the chance to shine against @entity57 on tuesday he made his @entity3 debut as a second half substitute in a friendly against @entity61 in february , and after being controversially chosen ahead of @entity62 in @entity35 's @entity2 squad got his first start in the 2 - 2 warm - up draw with @entity65			0
but he has only got a start now because @entity3 are already on their way home from @entity69 and @entity35 will use tuesday 's clash with @entity57 to give a game to everybody who has not been involved so far			0
impressive : @entity0 was called up by @entity3 after outstanding season at @entity6			2

@entity7 *believed* they had a £ 30m deal in place for left back
@entity11 wants to make @entity0 one of his first *signings* at @entity7
new @entity6 boss @entity18 wants to keep the 18 - year - old
