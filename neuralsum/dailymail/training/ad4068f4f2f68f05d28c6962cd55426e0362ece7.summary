by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 07:34 est , 6 august 2012 despite a £ 3 million taxpayer - funded campaign telling people to stay in @entity6 for their holidays , government ministers and @entity2 led by @entity3 will be doing the opposite this summer			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are also @entity12 - bound for their break from @entity14 , in direct contrast to the official ' @entity16 are @entity18 ' film involving some of the @entity6 's biggest stars that came out five months ago			1
launched in march , the adverts , which featured @entity22 's @entity21 , @entity24 's @entity23 , as well as @entity6 icons @entity25 and @entity27 , were hoped to harness the power of the @entity29 and @entity30 and inspire @entity6 to holiday in the @entity6			1
shadow culture secretary @entity42 is already away in @entity43 with her family , despite her counterpart @entity45 staying here for the entirety of the @entity48			1
one of ms @entity42 's aides told the @entity50 today that dame @entity51 is @entity52 's representative at @entity53 , not her , so her absence was not remarkable			2
@entity9 will also be taking his wife and two children for a two - week break in @entity58			1
meanwhile deputy prime minister @entity10 will be going to the @entity60 town of @entity61 to visit his wife @entity62 's family and then on to his villa in @entity43			2
defence secretary @entity11 is also off for a short break in @entity60			2
magic touch : @entity24 star @entity23 surfed at @entity68 beach in @entity69 for the advert , but the message did n't work on some mps and despite saying only last month that ' if you want a holiday then why not have one here , ' @entity3 will also take his wife @entity32 and their three children to a currently secret @entity12 location			2
but the prime minister will take some time off first in @entity82 , sources close to him have said			0
last year the @entity83 were in @entity84 for their hols			0
it appears justice secretary @entity87 is actually having a true staycation , as he will be spending his holiday at home in @entity91			0
across the @entity93 president @entity92 is leading by example by taking a ' frugal ' summer holiday on his country 's @entity97 coast			0
shunning foreign climes , as he had instructed his ministers to also do , the 57 - year - old self - styled mr @entity99 soaked up the sun in @entity103 , close to his official presidential retreat @entity105			0
patriotic : @entity25 asks the viewer ' why on earth ' anyone would want to leave the @entity6 , perhaps he should ask some politicians @entity27 : ' this it the @entity112 there is no @entity114 i 'm afraid ' @entity45 was the minister who launched the ' @entity16 are @entity18 ' campaign in march			1
the adverts feature the four celebrities encouraging @entity6 to explore @entity6 destinations and ends with the line , ' no passports			0
no wonder holidays at home are so great			0
' the government hoped the initiative - led by @entity130 with the support of the tourist boards of @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 - would discourage @entity6 holidaymakers from travelling abroad during a @entity137 and @entity29 year			1
defending its £ 3 million cost , mr @entity45 said : ' as an industry and as a government , we will know whether this type of campaign works and what the return on investment is			0

@entity3 , @entity10 , @entity9 , @entity42 and @entity11 are among politicians leaving @entity6 this summer
