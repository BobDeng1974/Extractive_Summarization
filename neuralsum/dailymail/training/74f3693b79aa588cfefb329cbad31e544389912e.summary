by @entity0 they are the fragments of the ancient world that have long been a bone of contention between @entity5 and @entity6			2
and now the @entity7 have come under closer – and brighter focus – thanks to a clever technique that brings @entity12 ’s revered past to life			0
the @entity14 – the showpiece institution which displays many of the artefacts from the famous hill that has long been the heart of the @entity5 capital – has announced an ambitious idea that sees it ‘ colour in ’ some of its key exhibits through digital technology			2
before and after : the museum is using 3d imagery to ' restore ' the marbles to their original appearance panels from the @entity30 temple , which were once daubed in bright hues , have been ‘ restored ’ to their original condition via the use of 3d digital images			1
stones from the celebrated structure ’s west frieze – which show a procession of pilgrims paying tribute to @entity41 , the @entity5 goddess who gave her name to the city – have been ‘ resurrected ’ in this manner , with flowing capes and brandished weapons			0
the images have been ' scanned ' onto the ancient stones to show them as they would have appeared some two - and - a - half millennia ago			0
iconic : the @entity14 ( right ) opened in 2009 as a showcase for the treasures of the @entity30 ( left ) the concept is part of the celebrations for the fifth anniversary of the museum ’s launch			1
a striking structure of glass and concrete , the museum opened in june 2009 as a modern showcase for the treasures of the @entity66 – on whose southern slope it sits			0
‘ in the first five years of life , the @entity14 has fulfilled our country ’s high expectations , ’ says @entity69 , the museum ’s president			0
‘ new technologies are increasingly finding their place in the museum , and now offer essential tools to aid the understanding of the great exhibits			0
’ landmark : thanks to its lofty location , the @entity30 is visible from many corners of @entity12 the museum has been regarded as a considerable success since it opened its doors , welcoming over 6.5 million people in its first half - decade – over 170,000 of them @entity6			1
its arrival has rekindled the debate about the fate of the @entity7 – panels from the @entity30 which , notoriously , are currently on show at the @entity93 in @entity94			1
while the @entity14 holds around half of the @entity96 – the main frieze which circled the @entity30 , telling a single story about worship in the ancient city – the other half has been kept in @entity94 for over two centuries			1
striking : a temple to the @entity5 goddess @entity41 , the @entity30 was constructed in the fifth century @entity105 the @entity106 were removed from situ between 1801 and 1812 by the @entity6 collector of antiquities @entity109 – nominally for their protection at a time when @entity5 was occupied by @entity112			2
however , the advent of the @entity14 as a world - class facility on the doorsteps of the temple has amplified the calls for the @entity106 to return home			2
‘ we comfortably welcome 3,000 visitors a day , and we are proud to have been recognised as being amongst the three best museums in the world , ’ mr @entity69 adds			0
blast from the past : the 're - colouring ' of the friezes is part of the celebrations for the museum 's fifth birthday @entity130 viewed as one of the finest remnants of the ancient era ( although it was not considered one of the original ‘ @entity135 ’ ) , the @entity30 was constructed in the fifth century @entity105 it remains an @entity12 landmark , visible from most corners of the city .			1

@entity30 marbles are ' restored ' to their original condition using 3d *trickery*
idea is part of the celebrations for the fifth birthday of the @entity14
the @entity7 - the friezes kept in the @entity6 - remain a topic of controversy
