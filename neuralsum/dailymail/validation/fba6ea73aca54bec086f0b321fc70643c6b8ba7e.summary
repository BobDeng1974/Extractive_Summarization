@entity0 led a chorus of tennis players giving drugs cheat @entity4 a send - off after the @entity7 player was effectively banned for life for committing another doping offence			1
the @entity7 journeyman was handed a 15 - year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances , including steroids , in out - of - competition tests carried out in december and january			1
the severity of the ban for the 29 - year - old world no 267 owes itself to @entity18 already having been given a two - year ban when he was found in 2010 by @entity22 customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at @entity25			1
@entity7 tennis player @entity4 has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation ‘ @entity32 … good riddance , ’ tweeted @entity0 , who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis			1
@entity34 joined in the condemnation of @entity4 who , even before 2010 , was deeply unpopular in the locker room			1
he tweeted : ‘ my feelings are that he ’s a d * * * * * bag and i hate that he has a @entity7 flag to his name when he ’s cheating , good riddance			2
’ veteran @entity45 doubles player @entity44 chimed in : ‘ @entity4 cheats again , what a joke			1
get out of the sport mate			0
’ @entity0 later beat @entity50 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 at the @entity51 and will face @entity53 ’s @entity52 in the quarter - finals			2
it was @entity0 ’s 496th win , equalling @entity58 ’s record for a @entity45 man in the @entity61			2
after his victory , @entity0 spoke further on @entity4 's ban			1
he told the @entity64 : ' i think it 's a good thing for tennis that he 's off the tour			0
@entity0 tweeted ' bye bye @entity32 ... good riddance ' before his win over @entity50 in @entity51 ' he was given a second chance in a way			0
he was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he 's been dealt with in the right way			0
' i think any doping in any sport is very bad			0
i think it 's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way			0
' i think [ testing ] is going in the right direction but i do n't think it will ever be perfect			0
' @entity4 issued a statement maintaining his innocence , claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the - counter supplement , but he has little credit in the bank , especially after being linked to the notorious @entity95 clinic in @entity96 two years ago			1
tennis has stepped up its drug - testing regime and introduced a biological passport , but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources			0
the fact that @entity4 was initially caught this time in december shows the value of more expensive out - of - competition testing compared to the cheaper option of doing it at major tournaments , where it is most expected .			2
