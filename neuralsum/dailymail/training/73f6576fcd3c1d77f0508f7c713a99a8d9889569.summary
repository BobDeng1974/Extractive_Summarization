after climbing high and fast through the ranks of @entity9 ’s @entity13 conservative party , pundits speculate great things lie in store for 41 - year - old @entity16 , who is up for re-election as governor in the state of @entity20 later this month			1
the son of a @entity9 mother and a @entity24 father from the tough @entity26 area of @entity27 , he is recognised as one of the leading figures in @entity9 's ruling @entity30			2
massive fan : the @entity24 governor of @entity9 's @entity20 @entity16 ( right ) receives a jersey from the head coach of @entity4 , @entity34 ( left ) , in july 2011 he has a massive following in the wealthy state he leads - so much so that the rival @entity37 seeking to oust him accuse his party machine of ' creating a @entity42 - like cult of personality around him			1
' even so , they are unlikely to topple the man who within a decade is expected to lead @entity9			2
in 2008 , he was appointed head of the @entity13 in @entity20 , the second most important and powerful regional post in the country			1
in 2010 , he became the state governor - one of a number of mixed - nationality citizens changing the political landscape of the @entity54			1
mr @entity16 , who has dual @entity56 - @entity9 nationality , grew up in @entity57 , where his father , @entity58 , was a @entity59 officer on attachment with the signals corps			1
before that he was a captain with the @entity63 on active service in @entity9 during the @entity65			0
growing up enclosed by the @entity66 left its mark on mr @entity16			2
future leader ? mr @entity16 , pictured with @entity9 chancellor @entity70 on a visit to a market garden in 2010 , is tipped to hold her position one day he said : ' @entity57 was surrounded by communism – that is how i experienced it as a child			2
this left its mark , and since then my motto has been " future , not socialism "			0
' previously , the youngest conservative party parliamentary leader in @entity9 , @entity16 is a trained lawyer who party insiders believe could be on the chancellorship ticket within ten years			1
he is known to be well liked – and well rated – by current leader @entity70			0
mr @entity16 is the first @entity56 citizen ever to hold such high office in @entity9			2
despite feeling @entity9 , he described his upbringing as ' very @entity56 – @entity56 network , @entity56 schools			0
' while most of the other kids went home to relatives in @entity56 , i had a @entity9 mum so i grew up fluent in both languages			0
' he said his parents imbued him with an equal sense of pride in @entity24 and @entity9			0
however , when he was 11 , the family moved to the @entity104 coastal town of @entity105 , a move which made it ' more or less clear to me that we had turned @entity9 then '			0
mr @entity16 still returns to @entity24 to visit cousins in @entity110 , and enjoys the odd can of @entity7 and shortcake at @entity113			1

' though @entity16 proposed to his wife on the shores of @entity127 and married in a kilt , he is keen not to be categorised as the @entity13 's token @entity9 - @entity24 politician and only uses his mother tongue with his two young daughters at home			1
while he insists that he does not have @entity57 in his sights just yet , others are convinced he is on the path to greatness			0
@entity9 weekly @entity137 compared @entity16 's career path to that of three - time chancellor @entity140 , @entity9 's longest - serving postwar leader			1
should ‘ @entity142 ’ , as the headline writers call him - and ' @entity142 ' after he took over the premiership of @entity20 - seek @entity9 's highest office , he has the potential to be chancellor , said @entity147 , political editor at the @entity148 , a @entity119 - based daily			1
' there are n't really that many others in the @entity13 of his age who look like coming through , ' he said			2
' @entity153 , a political scientist at @entity154 , said the @entity24 name would not hurt his chances			0
' it would n't bother anyone here , ' he said			0
