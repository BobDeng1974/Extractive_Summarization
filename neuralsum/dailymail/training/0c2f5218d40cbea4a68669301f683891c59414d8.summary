the night four @entity1 - including @entity1 ambassador @entity2 - were killed during a terrorist in @entity4 , @entity5 , last year , there reportedly were dozens of @entity7 operatives on the ground near the scene that night - and now the spy agency is going to great lengths to keep whatever they were doing there a secret			1
according to published reports , since january , several @entity7 operatives involved in the missions in @entity5 have been forced to submit to multiple polygraph tests - in some cases , operatives were given a test on a monthly basis			1
according to sources with direct knowledge of the situation , the agency is questioning operatives to find out whether they are talking about @entity4 with the media or with members of @entity29 , which just demanded that an investigation into the terrorist attack be a priority of the @entity34 's new director , @entity33			1
what happened ? nobody seems to know exactly what happened during the @entity4 attack - and the @entity7 seems to want to keep it that way according to @entity41 - which broke the story about the number of operatives on the ground the night of the attack , and the @entity7 's frequent use of polygraphs - a @entity41 operative who passes information on to @entity29 or the media faces career - ending consequences			1
one of @entity41 's sources described the @entity7 's attempts to keep elements of the @entity4 attack as ' unprecendented			1
' ' you have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation , ' one source said			0
another source described the @entity7 's tactics as ' pure intimidation			1
' in internal communications obtained by the network , one insider writes , ' you do n't jeopardize yourself , you jeopardize your family as well			0
' tragedy : @entity1 ambassador @entity2 was killed in the terrorist attack on the embassy in @entity4 @entity74 : the @entity75 refused to call the @entity4 attack ' terror ' for several weeks after the assault according to former @entity7 operative and @entity41 analyst @entity81 , agents are generally questioned once every three to four years , ' never more than that			2
' ' if somebody is being polygraphed every month , or every two months it 's called an issue polygraph , and that means that the polygraph division suspects something , or they 're looking for something , or they 're on a fishing expedition			0
but it 's absolutely not routine at all to be polygraphed monthly , or bi-monthly , ' @entity81 continued			0
the @entity7 denies that it is trying to keep things from @entity29			2
in a statement , @entity7 spokesman @entity94 insists that the agency has ' worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on @entity1 facilities in @entity4			2
' ' @entity7 employees are always free to speak to @entity29 if they want , ' the statement continued			2
' the @entity7 enabled all officers involved in @entity4 the opportunity to meet with @entity29			1
we are not aware of any @entity7 employee who has experienced retaliation , including any non-routine security procedures , or who has been prevented from sharing a concern with @entity29 about the @entity4 incident			1
' according to one @entity41 source , there were as many as 35 @entity7 operatives on the ground in @entity4 on the night of the attack , with up to seven wounded , in some cases seriously			1
at least 21 were in the building known as the @entity121			0
foreign serviceman @entity122 also was killed during the attack the actual number of operatives in @entity4 that night remains a mystery , though , as well as what - exactly - they were doing there			2
' we should have the people who were on the scene come in , testify under oath , do it publicly , and lay it out			0
and there really is n't any national security issue involved with regards to that , ' congressman @entity139 - who has been seeking answers about what happened in @entity4 for over a year			2
' i think it is a form of a cover - up , and i think it 's an attempt to push it under the rug , and i think the @entity1 people are feeling the same way , ' he continued			0
answers : congressman @entity139 wants people on the ground the night of the attack to testify under oath before @entity29 @entity139 also says that in the immediate aftermath of the attack , there were several people with close ties to @entity7 operatives and contractors who contacted him wanting to talk			1
now , he said , there is silence			0
' initially they were not afraid to come forward			0
they wanted the opportunity , and they wanted to be subpoenaed , because if you 're subpoenaed , it sort of protects you , you 're forced to come before @entity29			0
now that 's all changed , ' @entity139 said .			0
