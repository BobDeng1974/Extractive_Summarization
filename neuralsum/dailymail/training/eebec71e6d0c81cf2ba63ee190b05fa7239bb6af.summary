@entity0 is the ultimate high - end @entity2 brand — but hit trouble in 2012			1
now , three years after facing bankruptcy , its booming again , with online sales up an incredible 78 per cent			1
@entity8 loves their clothes , but admits they ’re too pricey to splurge on every time			1
so , could she get the classic @entity0 look for less ? @entity14 : @entity0 long - line cardigan , £ 175 @entity17 blouse , £ 125 skinny jeans , £ 89 total spend : £ 389 @entity20 colours are my thing , and the zingy colour of this cardigan is just fantastic			1
it really brightens my complexion			1
i also love the way it covers my bottom ! the material of the cardigan feels good quality , but is perhaps a little on the thin side			2
the shirt is soft and well - cut — although at this price , it should be			2
the jeans are a good colour and a great fit			2
4/5 @entity14 : @entity40 @entity42 cardigan , £ 28 , @entity43 @entity44 , £ 29.99 , @entity45 skinny jeans , £ 7.99 , @entity47 total spend : £ 65.98 this cardigan actually feels a bit thicker and softer than the @entity0 one , but i do n’t like the way it ’s longer at the back because it does n’t hang so well			1
this blouse would be fine for a 14 - year - old — but at the grand old age of 74 , i do n’t think i can get away with it			2
the material is frankly ropey , the collar is too prissy and the cheap , gold buttons do n’t help matters , either			2
these jeans are fine , but they are n’t quite such a pretty colour or good fit as the @entity0 ones			1
still , at £ 7.99 you ca n’t complain			2
3/5 out to dinner : @entity0 @entity69 sweater , £ 199 leather skirt , £ 450 total spend : £ 649 i ’m not a huge fan of the cut of this skirt			1
it makes it look like a kilt — which is not what you want from a leather skirt			2
the leather is butter - soft , and it certainly has a bit of va - va - voom			2
but the price ! cripes ! this jumper is beautifully cut , a great colour and it has interesting sleeves , but it bags slightly around the under arms , which is not ideal			1
3/5 out to dinner : @entity40 jumper , £ 19.99 , @entity45 leather pencil skirt , £ 85 , @entity93 total spend : £ 104.99 this jumper feels a bit thin , and is not nearly as luxurious as the @entity0 one			1
but i like the way it hangs			2
it ’s casual and sexy , which is a great mix. this skirt is two inches too long , but get it turned up and it ’s a definite winner			2
3/5 @entity102 , @entity103 : @entity0 wool jacket , £ 199 wool trousers , £ 150 crew neck jumper , £ 125 total spend : £ 474 you can really tell the quality of this			1
the grey , wool - rich jacket fits like a glove and is beautifully lined , so it would be warm and cosy at this time of year			2
the cut of both the trousers and the jacket is perfect , the trousers sit comfortably on my waist and the jacket is shaped to enhance my figure — but , at this price , i would expect perfect tailoring			2
i also love the soft , blue knit underneath — the pale , spring colours flatter my complexion			0
4/5 @entity102 , @entity103 : @entity40 wool mix jacket , £ 65 , and wool mix trousers , £ 45 , @entity129 @entity42 jumper , £ 12.50 , @entity43 total spend : £ 122.50 this two - piece suit is a great option for the price — it looks almost exactly like the @entity0 version , but it is more than £ 200 cheaper ! it does n’t feel as luxurious , because the lining is not as sleek , but to look at i could n’t tell the difference			1
the jumper is also a real bargain — it is incredibly soft and i thought it was cashmere			0
i prefer the slightly brighter colour with this outfit , too			0
5/5 @entity146 : @entity0 @entity148 jacket , £ 175 @entity150 sweater , £ 199 leather pencil skirt , £ 350 total spend : £ 724 i think @entity0 have made their classic mistake again with this jacket			1
it ’s that little bit too staid			0
it ’s too headmistressy for me and it ’s two inches too long			0
the jumper is nice , though i think i could easily find something very similar cheaper elsewhere			1
the skirt is well - made , and would be a versatile item in your wardrobe			0
it could be dressed down with a loose jumper and knee - high boots , or worn with a silk shirt for a glamorous look			0
but , at this price , you need to be certain you would get a lot of wear out of it			0
3/5 @entity146 : @entity40 @entity176 jacket , £ 36 , @entity178 jumper , £ 29.50 , @entity43 leather - look skirt , £ 30 , @entity180 total spend : £ 95.50 i much prefer this jacket , as it is a little shorter and looks more modern — at my age , it is important not to wear dated clothes			1
this skirt is n’t as comfortable as the @entity0 version , but it has a sexier cut and looks just as expensive			1
the jumper is also lovely and comfortable			0
i love this outfit — it could easily pass as real @entity0 , but for a fraction of the price			1
5/5 @entity193 : @entity0 @entity17 blouse , £ 125 @entity195 , £ 99 total spend : £ 224 this is a lovely , fun outfit that i ’m looking forward to wearing in the spring			1
the blouse feels very silky and lightweight , perfect for travelling			0
the colour of the trousers is very unusual for @entity0 but i love them — it ’s nice to try out something a little different , and they work well with the pale - pink shirt			1
i worry this outfit would look very creased if i wore it for a whole day , though			0
2/5 @entity193 : @entity40 @entity44 , £ 35 , and straight leg chinos , £ 25 , @entity43 total spend : £ 60 this version is much more affordable — the blouse fits well and looks just as good as the @entity0 one			1
i would much rather buy this			0
the trousers also fit me better , and they are a more relaxed style			0
they would be more practical to wear during the daytime			0
the washed - out colour of these trousers is also a bit more wearable			0
4/5 date night : @entity0 shift dress , £ 199 @entity17 print scarf , £ 99 total spend : £ 298 i ’m afraid the cap sleeves on this dress would be fine for a younger woman with beautifully toned arms — but are impossibly unflattering on an old lady like me			1
the colour is great , though , and it fits nicely			0
i can imagine my husband @entity229 absolutely loving this dress , as it ’s simple and shows off my figure			0
i ’m afraid the scarf is a teensy bit boring , though — the colours are too flat and it could really use a little extra oomph ! 3/5 date night : @entity40 shift dress , £ 25 , bhs.co.uk printed scarf , £ 7.99 , @entity239 total spend : £ 32.99 this dress is a bit more slouchy and much more me			0
it ’s not as flattering on the figure as the @entity0 dress , but it feels less air - hostessy and a bit more relaxed			1
crucially , the sleeves come down to the elbow			0
the scarf is fine for the price			0
the colours are strong , and it makes for a more casual look			0
to make it more glamorous , i would team this dress with a knock - out piece of jewellery			0
if you did that , i do n’t think anyone would guess you had bought it for just £ 25			0

@entity0 hit trouble in 2012 but is booming again now
@entity8 loves their clothes , but admits they ’re expensive
she tested out the cheaper alternatives for @entity272 , with interesting *results*
so , can you *pay* less for the same *effect* ?
