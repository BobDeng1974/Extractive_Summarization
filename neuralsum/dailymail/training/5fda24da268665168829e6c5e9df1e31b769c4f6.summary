although the couple share the same surname they are not married			0
ms @entity31 , a 48 - year - old macrobiotic chef , co-authored a cookery book with @entity24 about the diet which is based around grains , local vegetables , and avoiding animals products and processed foods , and is linked with the belief that food quality can affect health , happiness and well - being			2
famous followers of the diet are said to include actress and model @entity72 and singers @entity74 and @entity75			0
she claims her guru partner told her that she ' need not worry ' about their home being in his sole name ' as she was protected as a common law wife ' should they split up			0
however when the couple parted ways in 2008 , after a ' serious and committed relationship ' which lasted 15 years and produced a child , mr @entity7 told his former partner that she had ' no legal or beneficial interest ' in his flat , his cars or the books			2
ms @entity31 , originally from @entity90 , has now launched a @entity28 claim , asserting she is entitled to half shares in the property , the book royalties and the three @entity95			2
in documents filed at @entity45 ’s @entity28 , ms @entity31 ’s barrister , @entity97 , set out her case and told how the former golden couple of the new age scene came to fall out over money			2
' although unmarried , the parties began living together as man and wife at the property when ms @entity31 moved in on february 5 , 1994			1
the reason for the delay in her moving in is that mr @entity7 informed her that the timing and direction of her move had to be correct according to feng shui principles , ' the barrister said			0
' although it was purchased in mr @entity7 ’s sole name in september 1993 , it had always been the intention and understanding of the parties that it was to be their joint home , ' he went on			2
' following the birth of their son , ms @entity31 was concerned as to her position in relation to the property and any claims she may have against mr @entity7 in the event that the parties were to separate			1
cooking up a storm : ms @entity31 , a macrobiotic chef , co-authored a cookery book with her friend - popstar @entity24 ' these concerns were raised with mr @entity7 and the parties discussed their situation			1
mr @entity7 said to her that she need not worry as she was protected as a common law wife			2
' the parties agreed and understood this to mean that they both owned 50 per cent of the property and other assets they went on to purchase			0
this agreement and understanding was frequently repeated throughout the parties ’ relationship , ' he added			0
' ms @entity31 now understands that there is no legal concept known as a common law wife			2
in any event the agreement which they both made ... was that she was entitled to one half of the property and other assets which they purchased during their relationship			0
' she relied on this agreement - and the assurance given by mr @entity7 to her - to her detriment , ' the barrister said			0
mr @entity97 went on to claim that ms @entity31 was entitled to a share of the book royalties because she had ' edited them and co-authored the books ' and that she had also made substantial payments towards the upkeep of the family home and the maintenance of the family whilst living there			1
ms @entity31 is also seeking an order that she and her son @entity167 be permitted to live in the contested flat until he has finished @entity168			2
of this claim , mr @entity97 concluded : ' the property was purchased as a home for ms @entity31 and mr @entity7 and any children of the family			1
although the relationship has since broken down , ms @entity31 requires the property in order to provide a home for herself and the parties ’ child			1
” in his defence to the action , mr @entity7 ’s barrister , @entity180 , denied that ms @entity31 has any ' legal or beneficial interest ' in the flat , the cars or the books , and denied feng shui had anything to do with the timing of her move into the property			1
' it is expressly denied that the property was bought by mr @entity7 with the intention that it would be a joint home for ms @entity31 and himself , ' he said			1
' it is expressly and specifically denied that mr @entity7 sought to assuage any concerns by representing to ms @entity31 that she need not worry because she is his common law wife			1
issue : ms @entity31 wants 50 per cent share of the couple 's home in @entity44 , @entity45			1
@entity7 , who says that his teachings ' come from a place of love ' , is disputing the mother of his 16 - year - old son s right to a share of his wealth ' mr @entity7 has never described ms @entity31 as a ‘ common law wife ’ either to her or to anyone else , ' he went on			1
' the parties on occasion referred to themselves as ‘ husband ’ and ‘ wife ’ because they were in a serious and committed relationship which by 1996 had produced a child , ' he added			0
' these references have no connection to any understanding they had as to ownership of the property or any other asset , ' the barrister states			0
mr @entity180 also denied that mr @entity7 ’s former partner had edited or co-authored any of his books , or that she had the financial input into the home and family that she claims , adding : ' mr @entity7 never assured or promised ms @entity31 that his income was joint monies to be shared between them			1
' famous associations : @entity7 practices holistic therapies and counts @entity25 among his clients in promotional material for his alternative therapies business , which at times has earned mr @entity7 upwards of £ 90,000 a year and focuses on feng shui , macrobiotics and healing , the guru says : ' the words that best express my intentions are empathy , honesty , integrity , kindness , respect , dignity , understanding , care and gentleness ... you will be listened to and heard in a way that is non-judgmental , open , considerate and caring			1
' all our interactions come from a place of love			0
” @entity31 said outside court : ' i do n’t want to tarnish anybody ’s name ; i am just going to court to claim what i know is legally and morally mine			0
' there are so many women who are under the illusion that there is such a thing as a common law wife - i was one such woman			0
' i could walk away from this case with nothing , but i want to get it out there so other people know			0
” she called for the law to be changed to give long - term partners similar property rights to married women calling it ' outdated			0
