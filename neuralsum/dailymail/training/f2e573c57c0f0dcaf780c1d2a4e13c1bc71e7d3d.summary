by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 19:31 est , 23 september 2013 last week ’s @entity2 jackpot winner never intended to buy the $ 400 million golden ticket			1
the @entity5 man was actually just at the store to buy hot dog buns			1
the lucky guy has chosen to remain anonymous , but lottery officials say the newly minted millionaire was sent out to bye the buns by his wife and when the @entity14 gas station did n’t have what he wanted , he bought $ 20 worth of lottery tickets instead			1
it was only the man ’s second time ever playing the lottery			1
and the first person he told as he danced around his kitchen : the family dog			1
the lottery released a few details about last week 's winner , who lives in @entity42			1
he stopped to get gas at a @entity27 gas station outside @entity42 in @entity14 , @entity5 the day of the drawing last wednesday			2
his wife had sent him out to buy some hot dog buns , but the store did n't sell buns			1
after seeing the $ 400 million prize advertised , he bought lottery tickets instead			1
@entity52 ! the @entity27 is the second of the chain to sell a giant @entity2 jackpot ticket			1
the other one was across town on the other side of @entity42 , @entity5 where a reverend bought a ticket worth $ 260m in 2009 just make it out to cash : the unnamed @entity5 winner who will pocket $ 400m from wednesday 's @entity2 jackpot bought the winning ticket only after the store was out of hot dog buns it was only his second time playing the lottery			1
the winner checked his ticket thursday at his home and realized he was a winner			2
he told the only creature around , his dog			2
his dog , his wife and lottery officials may be the only people who know the winner for certain			1
@entity5 is one of only six @entity2 states that allow winners to refuse to let their identities to be released			2
the others are @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
lottery officials are n't saying whether the man took the $ 399.4 million payout over 30 years or the direct cash option of $ 233 million			1
the jackpot was the fourth largest in the history of the game and the @entity5 man was the only winner			0
meanwhile , the jackpots have grown exponentially since the ticket price doubled from $ 1 to $ 2 in january and after @entity102 , @entity103 ’s most populous state , joined the fray in april			0
lucky dog : the man claims it was only his second time ever playing the lottery and that he told his dog before anyone else an 84 - year - old @entity112 woman became the winner of the largest @entity2 jackpot ever in may			1
@entity115 hit all the numbers for a $ 590 million jackpot			2
in august , the so - called @entity120 ’s 16 — a group of @entity120 , @entity119 government workers — won a third of that month ’s $ 449 million jackpot			0
one of the other august jackpot tickets was also sold in @entity124 , @entity119 — to a man named @entity126			0
the other winner , @entity127 , bought his ticket in his home state of @entity130			2
the man was all alone when he read the winning numbers : 7 - 10 - 22 - 32 - 35 , with the @entity2 of 19			1
they were selected by the computer as a ‘ quick - pick			0
’ odds miracles happen : balloons and a sign announcing a winner of the @entity2 drawing are set up in front of @entity141 on thursday			2
the winner eventually came forward , though anonymously a person 's odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175 million			0
your odds of picking the winning numbers remain the same regardless of how many people play or how big the jackpot gets			0
and with so many number combinations , your odds pretty much remain the same whether you buy 1 ticket or 10 tickets			0
big jackpots in january 2012 , @entity2 tickets went from $ 1 to $ 2 , which led to larger jackpots in smaller amounts of time			1
of the top 10 @entity2 jackpots of all time , nearly half have been recorded since the game change			2
consolation prize since the revamp , a secondary $ 1 million prize has made for some happy losers			0
more than 730 people have won $ 1 million , and more than 120 people have won $ 2 million through the @entity2 option			1
someone is going to win - but probably not you a six - number combination will always be chosen , so even though the odds of your combination winning are astronomically low , the chances are high that someone , somewhere , will win			0
it 's math : do n't plan on winning			0
it 's hard for people to grasp how small their chances actually are , since no one can really see 175 million of anything			0
if you lined up 175 dollar bills , the line would twice stretch along the edges of the continental @entity103			0
or cover 380 football fields			0
yet only one of those bills would have the winning numbers			0
the winning ticket was bought at a @entity27 just off @entity195 west of @entity42 , the state capital			1
the store will get a $ 50,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket			2
state officials said the winner will pay @entity5 about $ 15 million in taxes			2
‘ i ca n't tell you what it feels like to know someone has been that fortunate and that lucky , ’ said @entity207 , executive director of the @entity208			0
she told @entity210 the windfall is ‘ wonderful shot in the arm for our state			0
’ the last big @entity2 winner in @entity5 also bought his winning ticket at a @entity27 , but on the other side of @entity42			1
the @entity219 won nearly $ 260 million in 2009			0
he has been active in the community , giving millions of dollars for education around the state			0
two days after last week 's big jackpot drawing , @entity219 gave $ 500,000 to purchase two new 56 - seat luxury coach buses for @entity225 in @entity42			1
jubilant : unlike the @entity5 winner , @entity127 ( here with partner @entity227 ) of @entity130 all but ran to a press conference following his $ 150m @entity2 win in august the @entity120 16 @entity119 garage workers who won a third of august 's $ 448million @entity2 jackpot held a press conference , but the bearded and outspoken , @entity237 enthusiast @entity236			1

it was the anonymous @entity42 man 's second time ever buying a lottery ticket
he bought $ 30 worth of tickets after his wife sent him to the store for hotdogs buns
the winner is the only @entity2 player in the country who hit all the numbers and will thus claim the entire prize
he told lottery officials he was alone when he realized he *'d* won , so he danced around the kitchen and *celebrated* with his dog
