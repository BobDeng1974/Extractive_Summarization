now his castle can be his holiday home as well			2
a 12th century castle that fell into ruin after it was gutted by fire nearly 35 years ago has just won one of architecture ’s most prestigious prizes following a ‘ stunning ’ restoration			1
it is also available to rent as a unique holiday hideaway for eight people from £ 675 for four nights			0
a £ 1.35million building project for the @entity26 charity – described as a labour of love for the @entity39 architects – created a contemporary home entwined with 800 years of history			1
it has its own moat , an outside dining hall within a ruined , roofless room , plus a huge fireplace for those chilly autumn nights			0
to add to the medieval atmosphere , the building is even said to come with its own headless ghost			0
ancient and modern : an architecture expert said : ' the architects have designed an incredibly powerful contemporary house which is expertly and intricately intertwined with 800 years of history ' plush : the new design is set within the shell of the ruin , visible outside the window the site has been in continuous occupation since @entity64 times and has links to three @entity2 queens			1
in the early 12th century it was owned by the @entity69 family but the first @entity71 queen , @entity70 , is said to have lived there in the mid 15th century before marrying @entity73 she bore him the ill - fated @entity75 , and their daughter later married @entity77 @entity78 , president of the @entity79 , said : ' @entity17 is an exceptional example of how modern architecture can revive an ancient monument it is the first time the @entity26 has appointed architects to build new living accommodation within the ruined walls of an ancient building many of the period features are retained in the bold yet sympathetic design it has long - standing links with the @entity94 family , including @entity94 , who was proclaimed queen in 1553 but executed with her father @entity96 a year later			1
@entity97 was captured in a hollow oak tree there			0
yesterday it was chosen from six shortlisted buildings to become the first conservation project to win the annual @entity103 , its highest accolade			0
president @entity78 praised architects @entity106 and described the work as ‘ an exceptional example of how modern architecture can revive an ancient monument ’			2
dilapidated : the @entity112 listed building was last used as a hotel before it was destroyed by the fire in 1978			2
a number of schemes to restore the site were proposed during the 1990s but they failed to materialise work needed : in 2006 a dozen architectural practices were asked to submit designs to provide accommodation within the existing site development : plans drawn up by the architects show how the castle had been developed over the centuries historical : the site was renovated on behalf on the charity the @entity26 which rescues buildings of historic or architectural importance			0
