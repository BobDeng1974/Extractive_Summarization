the future of 25 @entity2 babies born to parents who are asylum seekers is uncertain after immigration minister @entity4 retrospectively changed the legal status of some children born in detention			1
born in @entity2 from the 19 july 2013 , the infants - who range from the age of one to just a few months old - are currently in detention centres in the country , where their families anxiously await their fate			1
legislation passed by the government in parliament on tuesday morning means the babies are now defined as @entity19 ( @entity20 ) because their asylum seeker parents arrived in @entity2 by boat			1
the babies ' lawyer @entity23 told @entity25 : ' falling pregnant was the catalyst for many of these women to come to @entity2 ... it was the final straw , they did n't want to impose what they 'd suffered on their child			1
ms @entity23 , who is representing the families on behalf of @entity40 ’s social justice department , had been fighting for the right to apply for visas for the babies			1
however , a change to the @entity57 announced by mr @entity4 on tuesday means the babies now have little chance of being allowed to stay in the country in which they were born			2
ms @entity23 said : ' these babies are born to the most vulnerable parents			2
' the babies have never had a free day in their life ... it ’s so arbitrary and cruel '			0
speaking to @entity67 ms @entity23 also said : ' clearly @entity4 and his department agreed we had a good argument because they 've now amended the law			0
’ eight of the 25 babies are born to parents from @entity76			1
because of their @entity79 heritage the government does not recognise them as citizens			1
they could be sent to @entity52 detention centre in a matter of days due to immigration minister @entity4 's retrospective change one of the babies fighting to stay in @entity2 is a one - year - old @entity79 baby called @entity87 , who was born in @entity88			1
he is now being sent to live on @entity52 until his future is decided			2
@entity90 was born prematurely in @entity2 after his mother was classed as a high - risk pregnancy			1
ms @entity23 said the families are ‘ beside themselves with anxiety ’			0
the legislation means put forward by @entity4 ( pictured ) the babies are now defined as @entity19 ( @entity20 ) ' one woman grew up in an refugee camp in @entity100 from the age of three			1
she came to @entity2 when she was pregnant and spent time in @entity52 , ' she told @entity25			1
' she says she is tough but she does not want her child to go there as it is no place for children			0
' if you can put yourself in their situation these families have fled persecution			0
they have been returned to @entity2 because they are the most vulnerable cases			2
' the changes came as part of a deal mr @entity4 made			0
he argued that if the government would pass the @entity57 he would allow 108 children currently being held on @entity118 with their parents to be granted @entity120 rather than be deported to @entity52			1
ms @entity23 has a clear message for mr @entity4 , calling him out on the promise he broke when he vowed to allow children of asylum seekers to live in the community			0
' we are calling on him to be true to his word			0
he made a clear promise that children in detention would be released into the community , ' she said			0
' we are not saying they should be able to stay , we are saying they should go through the same application process			0
if they are not found to be refugees , fair enough			0
’ @entity40 senior associate @entity137 said : ‘ minister @entity4 claims that his bill will release children from detention , when in fact it will do just the opposite			0
‘ while some children may be released and may become eligible to apply for @entity120 , the bill also condemns 25 @entity2 - born babies to removal to @entity52			1
‘ buried in the bill are amendments that retrospectively deem these babies to have come from @entity52 , when they were born here and have never left @entity2			1
’ the infants are now being classed as @entity19 despite being born in @entity2			1
this is the @entity152 card of one of the babies they could be sent to @entity52 detention centre as early as wednesday mr @entity40 added : ‘ we are urgently calling on @entity4 to amend his bill and let these babies stay in @entity2 – they were born in @entity2 and have spent their entire lives here , yet because their mothers spent time previously on @entity52 they will now be taken away			1
‘ that is grossly unfair , and it is not the @entity2 way			2
' we also appeal to senator @entity165 , who holds the deciding vote , to stand up for these @entity2 kids and amend this bill			2
‘ senator @entity165 has kids of his own , and i ca n’t imagine he would want to see other kids born in our country locked up indefinitely on @entity52			2
’ ms @entity23 argues the children have never left @entity2 and should at least have the right to apply to stay in response to the 25 babies ' imminent deportation , @entity177 leaders around @entity2 held nationwide prayer sit - ins in seven mp 's offices in six cities : @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity88 and @entity189			1
more than 50 church - goers were spread protested in foreign minister @entity192 's @entity188 office as well as mr @entity4 's office on wednesday			0
on friday , @entity194 published photos from inside the family and single adult women camp - @entity197 3 ( @entity199 ) – were the women would have lived			0
@entity177 action group love makes a way organised a sit - in at @entity4 's office church - goers also visited @entity192 's office in @entity188 the distressing images showed young children playing in dirt , covering from the sun under cardboard boxes , and clothes hanging on fences			0
there have long been concerns over the way asylum seekers are treated at @entity52 and in october the @entity218 ( @entity218 ) visited @entity199 and expressed concerns that facilities there were in violation of international human rights laws in november 2013 , a @entity218 report ruled the education room at the centre was ‘ too hot for the children to remain in it for any length of time ’ and highlighted ‘ deteriorating mental health ’ of children held there			2
members of the media are currently denied access to the detention centre on @entity52 where there are already 106 asylum seeker children detained			0
the @entity218 recommended the government should ‘ cease to transfer children and their families to @entity52 under current conditions ’			2
@entity25 has contacted immigration minister @entity4 for comment			0
many reports have slammed the conditions of the facilities saying they are no place for children or families			0
