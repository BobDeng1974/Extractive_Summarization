in @entity1 , there is an inconspicuous wooden hut that does n't warrant a second glance			2
but this unremarkable building will be the entrance to a vault that could one day save the human race			0
a storage facility dubbed the ' @entity9 for seeds ' that will safeguard the planet 's food supply and rare plants against @entity14 is about to be constructed underneath it			1
the pioneering facility will use the natural cold of @entity1 's thick permafrost to preserve samples for up to 100 years			1
@entity21 you believe it ? this unremarkable building will be the entrance to a vault that could one day save the human race protection : the vault will enable scientists to safeguard many of the world 's most important foods against war and climate change			1
pictured is one of @entity34 's amazing permafrost caves unique : the building does not use any fans to keep the temperature under the ground cool and instead relies on the natural cold air move along , nothing to see here : the first part of the cryostorage facility in @entity34 was opened in december 2012 being built at a cost of 227 million roubles ( Â£ 3.2million ) , at least 1.5million seeds - from plants , vegetables , cereals and other food sources - will be housed in the special cryostorage unit in @entity34 , the coldest city on the planet			1
it will enable scientists to protect many of the world 's important foods and endangered plant life against climate change , war , and disaster , reported @entity61			1
in 2008 a similar vault was created in @entity63 , but the new facility in northern @entity1 is the only one of its kind that solely uses the unique natural permafrost cooling system			1
there is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples on the site , in the @entity72 , but a new purpose - built extension will turn it into the largest anywhere on the planet			2
@entity78 , lead researcher of the @entity80 - part of the @entity81 - said : ' the project does not use any machinery or electricity or gas			0
' it only uses natural cold and , respectively , the operating costs are minimal			2
' the first part of the cryostorage facility in @entity34 was opened in december 2012 , some 35 years after @entity90 scientists began an experiment in a mine at the @entity80			1
there is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples on the site , but a new extension will mean many more seeds can be stored the vault will be able to accommodate 1.5million seed samples , and will be filled with collections from @entity104 and the rest of the world scientists in @entity1 will be able to keep a stockpile of common seeds for up to 100 years without needing to replant them temperatures in @entity34 's permafrost caves are so low that quirky ice sculptures like this office scene this can be made @entity34 has an average winter temperature of @entity116 , making it the coldest major city in the world brrr - ight idea : the vault is in @entity34 , the coldest city on the planet - which is more than 3,000 miles from the @entity104 capital @entity123 at a depth of 12 metres they began the long - term storage of seeds from legumes at a temperature of about -7c using just the natural cold from permafrost			1
scientists were able to prove that seeds can be stored at that temperature , rather than colder , without losing any of their germinating capacity			0
later , about 1,000 seeds from crops common in the @entity72 , also known as @entity72 , were added to the vault along with some endemic , rare and endangered plant species			1
by the time the new facility opened in 2012 , there were 11,000 samples and there is now currently space for about 100,000 seeds from around @entity104			2
the unique building does not use any fans or pumps to keep the temperature under the ground cool and instead simply relies on the natural cold air			2
the new phase will be able to accommodate 1.5million seed samples , and will be filled with collections from @entity104 and the rest of the world			0
scientists aim to preserve many of the most endangered species of plants as well as keep a stockpile of common seeds for up to 100 years that they wo n't need to replant			1
they will be placed inside special sealed glass containers , with the freezing temperatures outside preserving them in a giant natural refrigerator			0
there is a similar storage laboratory in @entity168 , in @entity63 , but it relies upon artificial cooling measures as well as permafrost to lower temperatures to -18 degrees @entity172			0
this , according to scientists in @entity1 , makes it less safe because of the dangers of a power outage posing a risk to the ability to keep the facility cool			2
global warming may also raise the temperatures of the @entity63 ice fields and melt the permafrost , something that is not possible in the @entity72			0
@entity185 , from the @entity186 in @entity187 , said : ' when global temperatures get warmer by five degrees , the glaciers on @entity168 will melt			0
' to melt the permafrost in @entity72 temperatures need to rise by about 20 degrees			0
' so we have quite a unique situation in which the permafrost can create storage in natural conditions that will keep the desired temperature			0
' it is an eternal , and environmentally - friendly , system that can not be affected by any disasters			0

pioneering facility will use the natural cold of @entity1 's thick permafrost to preserve samples for up to 100 years
at least 1.5million seeds - from plants and vegetables - will be housed in the cryostorage unit in @entity34
it will enable scientists to protect many of the world 's important foods and endangered plant life against @entity215
