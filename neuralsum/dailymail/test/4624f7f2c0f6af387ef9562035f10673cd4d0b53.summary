it 's the ultimate in slow - motion footage			1
the @entity2 is to air a two - hour , real - time documentary following a canalboat as it pootles its way along a @entity7 waterway at a leisurely 4mph			1
for many , the languid film will be as interesting as watching paint dry , but the @entity11 hopes many viewers will find it a refreshing change from the usual frenetic pace of modern tv			1
there is no presenter , narrator , dialogue or music , so all viewers will hear are the sounds of the boat 's engine , the lapping of the water and the local birdsong as the barge makes its way along a picturesque stretch of the @entity31			2
00.00 : and they 're off ! 0 - 4mph in ten minutes 34.07 : bridge over ( not at all ) troubled water 41.50 : crazy boy racers scream past at 5mph aside from two aerial cutaway shots , when the boat negotiates a lock and crosses the @entity39 , the full two hours is shot continuously from a single camera on the front of the boat			1
rather incongruously , it 's the same specialist high - definition equipment used to shoot the action - packed @entity45 blockbuster @entity47			2
in contrast , the most exiting moments of all aboard ! the @entity51 involve the narrowboat being overtaken by a swan , or having to manoeuvre out of the way of a pleasure craft			2
other exciting scenes feature a plank of wood , a dog - walker and cyclists on the towpath			2
the film was shot on a sunny day last month and will air on may 5 as part of the @entity2 @entity65 series of deliberately unrushed programmes			1
producer @entity67 said : ' we want the voyage to feel like a sensory experience			0
we want it to be mesmeric , hypnotic and beautiful			0
' the idea was to create a moving painting			0
it is like a @entity76 landscape which changes in front of your eyes			0
if people are going to sit and watch a two - hour single shot , it needs to be the most beautiful two - hour shot it can be			1
' @entity85 , of the @entity86 , said : ' i think this is the right approach			0
the whole point about the waterways is they slow people down			0
' 55.40 : @entity93 ! @entity93 ! wild swan on the attack 1hr , 45m : gridlock ... @entity96 swamped by two boats 1hr 56m : it 's all water over the bridge ( at last )			0

the @entity2 is set to air a two - hour , real - time documentary following a boat
for many , the languid film will be as interesting as watching paint dry
