the note to friends detailed how he planned to get blind drunk and commit the assault straight after visiting the graves of the children he and wife @entity21 had killed			1
the correspondence emerged as his lawyers pleaded with a judge for a lenient sentence because the father of 17 was a ‘ very good ’ parent			2

his wife ’s barrister said losing her children was a ‘ sentence in itself ’			1

their friend @entity1 , 46 , was also found guilty of six counts of manslaughter			0
they will be sentenced this morning			0
over the past eight weeks , @entity43 has heard how they set fire to their house last may as part of a plan to frame @entity1 ’s former live - in lover @entity49			1
she had walked out of the shared three - bedroom semi in @entity52 , @entity53 , with her five children and the thousands of pounds in benefits they were worth to @entity1			1
the fire was also set in an attempt to get a bigger council house , a demand @entity1 had infamously made six years earlier on the @entity60			0

@entity65 , ten , and brothers @entity66 , 13 , @entity68 , nine , @entity69 , eight , @entity70 , six and @entity71 , five , all died			0

in a letter written from prison where he was on remand , he boasted : ‘ @entity76 , when we are free , which we will be , we ’re all going to get p * * * * *			2
‘ but me and my darling beloved wife , the most important thing that we will do when this happens is to spend the whole day with our babies , at the graveside			2
depraved : this morning presenter @entity84 holds a letter which @entity1 sent to friends while he was in custody awaiting trial for killing six of his children in a house fire sickening : this passage in the letter tells how @entity1 and his wife planned to celebrate their freedom by ' raping each other ' after visiting their children 's graves lack of remorse : six wooden crosses mark the graves of the @entity1 children which @entity1 intended to visit after his release from prison , but not before getting drunk first ‘ we do n’t care if it ’s raining , gale force winds , snowing			1
i ’m going straight up there			0
‘ then we shall probably – no , we will – rape each other			2
then we can all celebrate our freedom			1
’ superimposed on the words were eight pink hearts , one each for him and his wife and six for the children they killed			1

‘ that ’s his attitude , he ’s highly sex driven , ’ mr @entity123 said			0
‘ i would n’t leave @entity119 with him on his own			0
’ @entity1 showed little genuine emotion following the fire			0
he ‘ loved ’ being a local celebrity and was seen ‘ touching up ’ his wife in the hospital where her son @entity66 was dying after the fire , the former friend added			2
appalled : @entity1 's long - term friends @entity1 and @entity119 appear on this morning with former mp @entity135 to discuss their relationship with the house - blaze killer more interested in celebrating than grieving : mr @entity84 reads a passage from the letter , which also told how @entity1 intended to get very drunk as soon as he left prison twisted couple : @entity1 with his wife @entity21 , who friends say did not appear remorseful after the deaths of six of their children @entity1 and @entity1 in court for the mitigation hearing yesterday mrs @entity119 said @entity21 had planned a new outfit for her children ’s funeral , which she and her husband were later banned from attending			1
‘ i was quite shocked at it and said , “ you ca n’t wear that			0
” she said , “ will it be all right for the after party ? ” it was disgusting the way they were behaving			2
’ another friend , who asked not to be named , said @entity21 got drunk on alcopops at a neighbour ’s barbecue in the days after the fire , and showed off an £ 80 pair of pink trainers she had bought with money donated by sympathetic members of the public			1
in court yesterday , lawyers for the killers pleaded with mrs @entity174 to consider mitigating circumstances			0
@entity1 ’s lengthy criminal history was read out			0
he appeared in court a week before the blaze last year for a road - rage attack during which he punched driver @entity179 , 42 , who had his daughter @entity180 , 13 , with him in the car			1
angry scenes outside @entity43 crown court as @entity1 and @entity1 leave via prison van sentencing was adjourned till today the assault happened after @entity1 swerved in front of him , forcing him to stop , because he believed mr @entity179 had cut him up at a roundabout			0
@entity1 pleaded guilty to common assault but denied dangerous driving and was bailed awaiting trial			1
in 1991 , he received a two - year conditional discharge for headbutting a colleague and in 2010 was given a police caution after slapping @entity21 and dragging her outside by her hair			1
@entity199 said @entity1 ’s conviction for stabbing his former girlfriend @entity201 27 times in 1978 , revealed by the @entity203 yesterday , was a ‘ long time ago ’ and said there was no evidence of anything like it being repeated			0
but he was immediately cut off by the judge , who retorted : ‘ there ’s been violence in every single relationship , has there not ? ’ the lawyer added : ‘ despite mr @entity1 ’s faults he was a very good father and loved those children			2
he is , as is @entity21 , a parent who lost six children			1
he ’s never been able to grieve or even to bury them			0
‘ he will have to live with the hatred and hostility of the press and the public for the rest of his life			0
’ @entity223 , for @entity1 , said she was ‘ an extremely good mother to all 11 children ’			2
