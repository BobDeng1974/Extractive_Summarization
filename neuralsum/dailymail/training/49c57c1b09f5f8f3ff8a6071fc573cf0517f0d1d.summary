it ’s the biggest away game of the season for the @entity4 champions , but with three days to go before kick - off @entity5 have sold just 30 tickets for their visit to the @entity8 on saturday			1
one of the peculiarities of @entity4 football is that there is no tradition of huge travelling support , but even taking that into consideration , the failure to take up their measly allocation of 250 is staggering			0
prices at the @entity8 , starting at 70 euros for away fans , will have made up some supporter 's minds			1
@entity5 fans have had an expensive time of it lately with last season ’s trips to @entity27 and @entity28 in the @entity30 semi-final and final			2
alone : @entity32 , @entity5 's manager , will be one of the few at the @entity34 supporting the team repeat ? @entity36 celebrates scoring the opening goal of the @entity30 final against @entity39 it seems , the fact that there are no more than five miles between stadiums has not been enough to tempt them to put their hands in their pockets and the fact that the game is not available on terrestrial television has also not got the waverers heading to the club ’s ticket office			1
there is also an element of derby - fatigue after these sides met twice in the @entity57 just last month			0
and @entity58 are in town on october 1 as @entity5 ’s @entity30 adventure kicks - off against the @entity62 champions			0
even with the @entity5 fans ’ no - show there will be 81,000 supporters in the @entity8 on saturday as @entity39 look to make up for losing both the league and the @entity57 to their neighbours in recent months			1
if @entity5 score - the silence will be deafening			0
a few more than you ... the @entity34 will see about 81,000 real fans compared to a measly 30 @entity5 so far			2

@entity5 sell just 30 tickets for visit to @entity34 on saturday
@entity5 derby has not *attracted* attention of away fans , who live less than five minutes away from @entity39 's *85,000* - seater stadium
@entity5 were given an allocation of 250 but are *struggling* to sell
tickets start at 70 euros for away fans and the match is not on television
