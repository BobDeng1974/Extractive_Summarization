@entity1 's most pernicious invasive plant , @entity3 knotweed , may have finally met its match in a two millimetre - long insect it has plagued gardeners for decades and affected thousands of house sales because of its ability to grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks			1
but @entity1 's most pernicious invasive plant , @entity3 knotweed , may have finally met its match in a two millimetre - long insect			1
research on @entity13 , a psyllid or plant louse similar to aphids , has established that it inhibits the growth of the knotweed and poses no risk to native species , including the plant 's close relative rhubarb			1
scientists at @entity22 , formerly @entity23 , announced that they have also succeeded in getting the insect to survive through @entity25 winters			2
dr @entity26 , from @entity22 , said : ' the results confirmed the psyllid to be a high - specialised natural enemy of @entity3 knotweed			1
the challenge now is to get the psyllid to establish in the natural environment which , as for any programme of this type , is n't easy			0
' tens of thousands of specially bred lice were placed on knotweed at eight locations in @entity37 and @entity38 as part of the research			2
this was the first time the release of an alien insect species had been authorised in the @entity45			1
the study found the insect would feed on the sap of the knotweed , inhibiting its growth - but it failed to breed on any of 90 other native @entity25 species , meaning that they would face no threat from the insect			1
scientists say the number of colonies that have successfully over-wintered remains too small to be certain that the bug could widely establish itself in @entity1			2
but if it does , they believe the bug will allow natural order to slowly reassert itself and knotweed could eventually be seen as just a ' mild nuisance '			2
writing in @entity64 , dr @entity63 said : ' a more natural equilibrium is restored			0
biological control does n't aim to eradicate the target plant , but rather to reduce its vigour and invasiveness			1
keeping the invasive plant in check ideally allows native plants to re-establish and flourish			0
homeowners faced bills of up to £ 20,000 to remove the prolific foreign invader before they could sell			0
earlier this year , @entity80 's house lost half its value because @entity3 knotweed started taking over the back garden			1
the 91 - year - old was told the house in @entity97 , which was expected to be valued at £ 80,000 , will not sell for more than £ 45,000 because of the untamed wild weed			0
the destructive bamboo - like plant has flourished across the country and the government estimates it would take £ 1.5billion to clear the infestation			0
it can grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks , and easily spreads from neighbouring homes , wasteland , waterways , railway lines or footpaths			0
its extensive deep roots can penetrate roads , concrete , damage foundations and drains			0
@entity3 knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into @entity1 by the @entity117			1
incredibly invasive , it can grow four inches ( ten centimetres ) in a day from april to october and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days			0
apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways			2
@entity132 is recognised by its shovel - shaped leaves , bamboo - like stem and white flowers produced in autumn .			0

scientists have found an insect which inhibits growth of @entity3 knotweed
@entity13 poses no risk to other species , meaning it could be released
scientists were able to keep the insect alive throughout the winter
this is the first time biological control of a weed has been allowed
