it has long been debated whether humans are responsible for the extinction of the woolly mammoth			0
now , a new study suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in @entity7 around 30,000 years ago			1
by studying the bones of mammoths , horses and reindeer , the experts ruled out climate change and food shortages as the reason for the population plunge			1
a new study suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in @entity7 around 30,000 years ago , adding weight to the argument that humans are to blame for the creature 's extinction			1
an illustration of a woolly mammoth is shown researchers from the @entity26 , @entity27 and the @entity28 in @entity29 , analysed bones , teeth and mammoth ivory from the @entity34 era between 30,500 and 22,000 years ago			1
they found that woolly mammoth numbers declined , but that climate conditions as well as food and water supplies for the giant herbivores remained stable			2
the woolly cousins of modern elephants roamed northern @entity42 and @entity43 beginning 300,000 years ago , but some 10,000 to 20,000 years ago , all but a few of the isolated island populations disappeared			1
by studying bones , researchers found that numbers of woolly mammoths declined , but that climate conditions as well as food and water supplies for the giant herbivores remained stable , indicating that hunting is the main cause			1
a depiction of a hunting party using a pitfall trap is shown since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths			2
all but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago			1
one popular theory , bolstered by this study , is that @entity64 people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence			0
however , some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago			1
other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in @entity43 13,000 years ago , led to rapid climate change , eventually wiping out the mammoths			1
today , it 's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction			0
the study , led by @entity79 dr @entity78 , which was published in @entity81 explains that finds of mammoth bone or ivory artefacts become rarer throughout the @entity34 era			0
she focused on finds from @entity27 ’s @entity89 region and the @entity91 valley in south western @entity92			0
together with experts from the @entity95 in @entity96 , dr @entity78 found evidence that the slow disappearance of mammoths was linked to intense hunting by humans			2
the team analysed the composition of stable isotopes in mammoth , horse and reindeer bones – a technique that is used for gathering dietary and environmental information from extinct species			2
the relative amounts of carbon , sulphur and nitrogen isotopes provide indications of the stability of the animals ’ environment			0
all three species showed a mainly stable concentration of isotopes during the @entity34 era , meaning that their environment did n’t change much , ruling out climate change as the reason for the decline of mammoths			1
in the early 20th century , 11,000 - year - old cave paintings of woolly mammoths were found in @entity92 , suggesting that the creatures once lived side by side with humans			0
while this is now accepted , experts are still trying to solve the chilling question of whether humans are responsible for mammoths ' extinction			0
this image shows a prehistoric rock painting of a mammoth but the researchers found that the concentration of @entity146 nitrogen isotope in the remains of horses from the @entity89 , increased during the @entity34			2
based on this information , they believe that horses in the region were taking over the ecological niche of receding mammoth populations			1
they measured levels of the oxygen isotope 180 to investigate whether climate change may explain the movement			2
but dr @entity78 said there were no signs of major climate changes in that epoch , ‘ so it is highly likely that the decrease in mammoth populations in south western @entity27 was caused by humans			1
’ scientists said last march that they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a ' high chance ' it will happen			0
experts expect to extract ‘ high quality dna ’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in @entity176			0
woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern @entity176 around 4,000 years ago			1
@entity179 , vice president of the @entity181 @entity180 , said : ‘ the data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth			0
’ but he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life , urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth , not to play @entity191 for the sake of it			0
‘ we must have a reason to do this , as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity , ’ he said			0
a cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother .			0

researchers in @entity27 have found that hunting significantly depleted mammoth populations in @entity7 around 30,000 years ago
they studied the bones of mammoths , horses and reindeer
analysing isotopes ruled out climate change as a cause of population cuts
all but a few isolated populations died out 20,000 to 10,000 years ago
