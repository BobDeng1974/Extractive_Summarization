by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 09:56 est , 1 february 2013 a baby girl nearly died after she was born with a tumour crushing her windpipe			1
doctors had to race to save @entity6 ' life by creating an airway so she can breathe			1
the tumour weighed 0.6lb - a sixth of her 3lb 9oz weight when she was born			1
had she not been born by caesarean section , she would have been unable to breathe because the tumour was pressing down so hard on her airway			1
and the pioneering operation she had to remove it is a @entity20 first , doctors say			2
@entity6 was born after her twin sister @entity21 , who arrived without any problems			1
@entity6 ( left ) with mother @entity23 and twin sister @entity21			2
@entity6 was born with a cancerous tumour the size of an orange on her neck , which left her struggling to breathe but the surgical team from @entity30 and @entity33 's @entity32 maternity hospital were faced with a much more complex situation with @entity6			1
they had to free her head from the uterus , allowing her to continue getting oxygen from the umbilical cord as they fitted a tube down her constricted throat to enable her to start breathing normally			0
dr @entity43 , the consultant anaesthetist at @entity44 who found and secured @entity6 's airway during the ' exit procedure ' , said : ' as soon as the baby 's head was out of the uterus it was a race against time			1
' we estimate the placenta will continue to supply oxygen through the cord for up to five minutes , but you can never be sure , it could break off at any time			0
' the baby was so small and the tumour so big , it was a very difficult job to secure the airway			2
the relief when i secured the tube was unimaginable			0
it was definitely the most stressful few minutes of my career			0
' @entity6 's mother @entity23 , from @entity70 , near @entity71 , @entity72 , said they found out she had an abnormal mass at an ultrasound scan 33 weeks into the pregnancy			2
she said : ' the few weeks leading up to and after the twins ' arrival were a blur , it 's crazy to think just how much has happened to my baby			0
i can remember walking into the operating theatre to have the caesarean and not knowing what was going to have happened when i woke up			0
' when doctors weighed the tumour , they found it accounted for a sixth of @entity6 's body weight			1
she is now responding well to treatment the orange - sized tumour was removed 10 days after the twins was born and specialists believe @entity6 has every chance of making a full recovery			1
the twins , who are now 16 weeks old , are now back home with their parents and older sisters @entity102 , 16 , and @entity103 , 11			0
@entity104 , the consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon , who removed @entity6 's tumour said : ' the tumour was sitting right on the trachea and was very close to her major arteries			1
' it was tricky to remove , but i managed to get it all			0
' when we weighed the tumour it accounted for one sixth of her entire body weight			1
it is very rare for a baby to develop a tumour of this size in the womb			0
' tests showed the tumour was cancerous and @entity6 was put on a course of chemotherapy at the @entity30 after her birth , which is continuing			1
mr @entity130 said : ' @entity6 looked so much better after mr @entity104 removed the tumour			1
her head was not forced back anymore , she looked like a normal baby			0
' then we found out she had cancer , it was unbelievable			0
' but dr @entity137 , who is treating @entity6 , said she should recover fully			2
she said : ' it is very rare for a baby to be born with such a large cancerous tumour			2
' she is coping well with treatment			0
the cancer has n't spread and we are expecting her to make a full recovery			0
' mrs @entity6 said : ' i was really nervous going home for the first time without the support of the nurses , but it was also such a relief and meant @entity6 was getting better and we could be a family			2
' we only have to go to the hospital every three weeks for chemotherapy at the moment , and she 's getting stronger every day			0
