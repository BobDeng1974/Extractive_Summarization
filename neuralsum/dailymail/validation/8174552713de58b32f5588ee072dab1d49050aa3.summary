for six years a fleet of ten @entity1 have been sitting unused and unwanted at a @entity1 factory in @entity3 , @entity4			1
now there may be hope for them as two buyers have come forward keen to buy the cut price jets			0
the abandoned and half - completed aircraft have been labelled the ‘ terrible teens ’ after being relegated during the early stages of production after numerous structural and weight issues			1
problems arose after @entity1 fast - tracked production before the @entity24 was certified airworthy			1
as a result the teens , which were among the earliest designs to be built , were made too heavy to fly as far as manufacturers had hoped			0
although @entity1 has never divulged the weight difference for the teens compared to catalogue models , once they are finished their range is estimated to be 6,850km , 1,850km less than later 787 - 8 dreamliner models			2
workers assemble @entity24 jets at the @entity36 in @entity3 , @entity4 @entity38 ceo @entity37 : @entity38 is said to have bought two of the overweight planes ten early - production 787s were dubbed the ' terrible teens ' after being abandoned due to design problems the @entity1 passenger jetliner was introduced for the first time on sunday , july 8 , 2007 but their rock bottom price tag is finally attracting buyers , with @entity38 and @entity49 said to be in talks to buy the lot in attempts to cut costs amid soaring fuel prices			1
two of the jets have been ordered by @entity38 , a @entity57 airline with its headquarters at @entity59 in @entity60 on the island of @entity62			0
eight more of the heavy @entity1 look set to go to @entity49 which is said to be in ' advanced discussions ' to buy them			1
@entity49 is currently weighing up the addition of many different jets to its fleet @entity68 reports the @entity70 airline is currently weighing up the addition of many different jets to its fleet including the latest version of the @entity73 and the @entity74			0
the @entity1 ran more than three years behind schedule for problems with carbon - fibre , on - board systems and manufacturing processes to be ironed out			2
it finally launched to great fanfare in 2011 , three years after the so - called jetlag - busting was supposed to go into service			0
airlines that use the jet , which is lightweight , making it more fuel - efficient for long - haul flights , include @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and all @entity91 .			0
