@entity0 did n’t deserve to be dismissed on saturday and @entity1 called both incidents involving the combative centre forward correctly			1
in the first , @entity0 over-reacted to a strong challenge from @entity5 , pushing his legs and boots out towards the @entity9 centre half			1
@entity5 ignored the act and merely jogged back into position rather than make a meal of the clash			2
this reaction must be applauded as , if friend had considered disciplining @entity0 , @entity5 made it easy to ignore the misdemeanour			1
in the second half the @entity19 forward was a little unlucky after his trailing arm caught @entity22 in the face during an aerial challenge			2
@entity0 catches @entity9 's @entity22 with an arm while battling for a header during the second half @entity0 had earlier been involved in a clash with @entity28 with the striker appearing to kick out at him it was not a deliberate act – a player will clench his fist to give power through the elbow if he wants to hurt the opponent – but worthy of a yellow card as he should have been more aware of the consequences of his movement			1
while @entity1 did well with these two incidents it was very disappointing to see him ignoring the open , and blatant , grappling by @entity9 ’s defenders at @entity19 set pieces			1
they clearly saw @entity45 and @entity46 as dangers and , in what looked like pre-planned tactics , held them at almost every set piece			2
elsewhere we saw an excellent performance from new referee @entity54 making his @entity56 debut at @entity57			0
his quick reactions to a poor and late @entity59 sliding challenge on @entity61 stopped the @entity63 man from retaliating more than he did , which would have probably resulted in a red card			0
@entity1 could have punished @entity9 's defenders who employed questionable tactics at set pieces @entity69 final assistant @entity68 who was spot on in allowing @entity72 ’s goal for @entity63 @entity54 was then absolutely right to award the home side a penalty when @entity63 defender pulled down @entity77 ’s @entity76 just inside the penalty area			1
two offside decisions caught the eye – one very good and one not so good			0
first a superb one from @entity69 final assistant @entity68 who was spot on in allowing @entity72 ’s goal for @entity63			0
the bad one came at the @entity83 with the score at 0 - 0			0
@entity85 was flagged offside when clean through but replays showed he was just onside			0
finally , too often we blame referees for poor decisions but @entity93 ’s @entity92 must take all the plaudits for his actions at @entity96			0
he left @entity97 with no option but to caution him when he whacked the ball miles away after giving a clear free kick away			1
then just under 50 seconds later he trod on an opponent to get his second yellow card			0
@entity85 was wrongly flagged offside when through on goal against @entity104 at the @entity83 @entity92 was sent off by referee @entity97 after picking up two bookings in one second - half minute			2

some fans felt @entity0 deserved to be sent off against @entity9
the @entity19 striker was involved in two incidents but only got a booking
@entity9 's defenders should have been punished for their tactics
@entity115 left @entity97 with no choice but to send him off
