by @entity0 revelling in the sunshine and with the prospect of a good day out ahead of them , the scene as racegoers arrived for the first day of @entity3 could n't have been more quintessentially @entity7			2
and in true race day style , the hats were big and the dresses colourful as cheerfully dressed ladies made their way into the @entity15 racecourse for their day out at the races			0
among the most spectacular were the hats worn by guests @entity19 and @entity20 , who had both splashed out on super-sized titfers made from iridescent peacock feathers and delicate grey marabou			0
looking good : racegoers @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) show off their gorgeous be-plumed hats as they arrive at @entity3 stylish : many of the racegoers at @entity3 plumped for hats in elegant café au lait hues , while @entity30 ( right ) opted for cheerful orange others plumped for more classic styles with wide - brimmed hats in elegant café au lait and caramel hues proving particularly popular among the @entity3 sorority			1
although not quite hitting the sartorial heights of @entity39 , @entity3 is catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the opportunity to dress up for the occasion			1
like its @entity45 counterpart , @entity3 also operates a strict dress code that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress			1
instead , the style guide suggests ' jackets and either ties , cravats or polo neck sweaters ' for gentlemen and ' smart casual ' for ladies , adding that ' due to the terrain and areas of decking at @entity3 , flat shoes are recommended '			2
stylish : a pair of racegoers keep it simple in elegant cream ensembles bedecked with blooms and accessorised with striking black chapeaux beautiful : a racegoer arrives dressed to the nines and sporting a particularly lovely hat in burned crème brûlée straw trimmed with cream grosgrain ribbon and feathers in bloom : an elegant racegoer opts for a titfer decked with bold blooms - a huge trend among racegoers at @entity39 earlier this summer enjoying the day : a mother and daughter look on as @entity85 sweeps to victory in the first race of the day , the @entity88 racegoers certainly appeared to be taking those strictures to heart , with no sign of the wacky hats , skintight frocks and skyscraper heels that characterise other meets , most notably @entity96			1
on the course , racing action got underway with the @entity88 which was taken by @entity100 bred gelding @entity85 , with sir @entity101 's i 'm @entity103 in second place and the @entity106 's horse @entity105 in third			1
the @entity107 , the big race of the day , was won by two - year - old colt @entity109 , who beat another @entity101 horse , @entity111 , into second place to claim the prize			0
tomorrow will see the @entity115 guineas and @entity117 winner @entity116 take on the hotly tipped @entity118 in the biggest race of @entity3 , the @entity120 , in a run that has already been dubbed the ' duel on the @entity123 ' by racing pundits			0
need a new hat ? a racegoer decides that he ca n't handle the heat without a hat but follows the @entity3 dress code by plumping for a panama popular choice : many of the male racegoers plumped for dapper panama hats worn with neatly pressed linen suits and polished brown brogues @entity137 @entity7 : racegoers sporting neat linen suits , panama hats and delicate floral tea dresses appeared to have taken the strict dress code to heart tsunami of titfers : the stands at @entity3 today were a sea of hats , with the majority of gentlemen plumping for stylish panamas wonderful : a pair of racegoers enjoy the action from the comfort of a deckchair set on a hill overlooking the racecourse - said to be the loveliest in the @entity159 while @entity160 is famous for pearls and fur , and @entity96 for its colourfully dressed fillies in fake tan and skyscraper heels , @entity3 's trademark is low key luxury - and flat shoes			1
delicate bejewelled sandals are the most popular with racegoers , as are @entity171 ballet pumps and in the case of some hardened souls , comfortable loafers and deck shoes			0
nevertheless , the meeting is n't short of glamour with plenty of the big , bold , be-plumed hats of the sort seen at @entity45 's @entity39 and neat , nipped - in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock			1
as at @entity39 , racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart - casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress			1
' @entity3 is famous for being a stylish yet relaxed occasion , ' continues the style guide , ' and gentlemen are required to wear jackets and either ties , cravats or polo neck sweaters in the @entity198			2
' linen suits and @entity200 are traditionally worn by gentlemen			0
jeans and shorts are not permitted in the @entity198			0
in other enclosures dress is smart casual			0
' @entity208 shoulder tops and fancy dress are not allowed in any enclosure			2
due to the terrain and areas of decking at @entity3 flat shoes are recommended			0
' lonely up there ? a local enjoys a free day out as he watches the races from his hilltop perch with the beautiful @entity123 rolling out behind him in the background busy : inside the @entity15 racecourse , the paddock and stands were thronged with excited racegoers eager for the horseracing action to begin winning ways : two - year - old colt @entity227 ridden by @entity229 thunders home to take the @entity231 followed by @entity233 's @entity232 racing : the highlight of this week 's meet is tomorrow 's @entity120 , although the crowd appeared to enjoy the @entity231 ( pictured ) just as much spectacular : it was a quintessential @entity7 summer day out at @entity3 today as colourful racegoers bathed in sunshine backdropped by the @entity123			2
