‘ we do the best that we can do and the @entity25 result at the weekend gives us an opportunity to finish second so our mentality , the run and confidence we have at the moment we are just going to take that into every game and see where it takes us			1
’ this was @entity1 ’s sixth consecutive away clean sheet in the league – they have not conceded on the road since losing at @entity46 on december 14 – and defending provided the bedrock of this performance			1

‘ we talked at half - time about penetration and options for the guy in possession			2
but @entity72 came on and offered that calmness			2
we switched to a diamond in the second half and he came on and fitted into the bottom of that and his calmness and control was important to that			0
‘ you have to pay respect to the team as well			0
they ’ve been playing well getting results and over the last 3 months we ’ve been in great form but we have to pay attention			0
‘ he ’d been out for a considerable period of time now but he is fit and you see how important he is when he came on			0

‘ we should have scored a goal , maybe a couple in the first half			0
second half , we started to make the wrong decisions with the ball , and invited a little bit of pressure			0
