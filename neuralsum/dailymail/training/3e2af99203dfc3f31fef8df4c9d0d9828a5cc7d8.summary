the beautiful texts of ancient @entity1 have captivated our imaginations for thousands of years			2
from the tragedies of @entity5 to the epics of @entity7 , modern literature throughout the world continues to be inspired by these classics			0
but the haunting music these poems were originally sung to have long since been lost , with researchers instead focusing on the meaning of the words			0
scroll down to listen to the music ... the music of ancient @entity1 , which has n't been heard for more than 2,000 years , is being reconstructed by @entity18 , a musician and tutor in classics at @entity21 now an expert from @entity21 has reconstructed the music , and rediscovered some of the instruments that played them - and he claims the recordings are 100 per cent accurate			1
‘ there is no question that we can reconstruct what this fascinating music sounded like , ’ dr @entity18 , a musician and tutor in classics at @entity21 , told @entity29			1
‘ we have been left with clear instructions , thousands of years old , about how to create instruments used to play the music with mathematical precision			0
’ one of the great @entity43 lyrists and few known female poets of the ancient world , @entity41 was born some time between 630 and 612 bc. her love poetry would have been composed to music , such as the tune heard above the result , according to dr @entity18 , is ‘ something quite magical ’ which may sound odd to our ears , but was hugely popular with audiences at the time			1
to reconstruct the music , dr @entity18 and his team put together existing clues about the tunes , rhythms and the instruments of the time			1
the rhythms , for instance , are preserved in the patterns of long and short syllables in the words of the texts themselves			1
the instruments used – such as lyre and reed - pipes - are known from , paintings and archaeological remains			1
the instruments used - such as lyre and reed - pipes - are known from , paintings and archaeological remains , such as this illustration from @entity74 by @entity7 the lyre ( left ) is a string instrument known for its use in @entity43 classical antiquity and later			1
the right image shows the @entity79 epitaph , the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition			0
the song is in the ancient @entity43 musical notation , was found engraved on a tombstone , near @entity85 , @entity86 some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear , said dr @entity89			2
one complete piece , inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 ad , is a haunting short song of four lines composed by @entity79			0
the words of the song may be translated as : while you ’re alive , shine : never let your mood decline			0
we ’ve a brief span of life to spend : time necessitates an end			0
meanwhile , ancient documents found on stone in @entity1 and papyrus in @entity107 , reveal exactly how the pitch should have risen throughout the composition			1
inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 @entity112 , the documents show alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the @entity43 words that reveal the mathematical ratios of musical intervals			2
dr @entity18 said that similar music to that played in ancient @entity1 can today found in the folk music traditions of @entity123 and @entity86 , providing an insight into the sounds and techniques used			1
for instance , in ancient @entity1 , a musical note would go up in pitch on certain syllables and fall on others , rather than being stressed			2
' one of the things @entity1 were fascinating by at all times was the notion of imitation , ' said dr @entity18			1
pictured is artwork from the @entity139 , a 5th century illuminated manuscript of the @entity140 , depicting a battle scene			0
this poem may would have been set to music to enhance the emotions it evoked the music of this period also used delicate intervals such as quarter - tones , and the melody was often different to the vocal pitches used in the poems			0
‘ we ’re talking about a period of around 1000 years so there was lots of different styles and sounds that many of which would have been lost , ’ said dr @entity18			2
‘ in so far as we ’re aware of different sounds the earliest music , say from 5th @entity112 , are more alien to us that the later music from 200 ad , which sounds a bit like early church melodies			0
’ dr @entity18 has only just begun his collaborative two - year project , at the end of which he hopes to uncover exactly what music meant to ancient @entity1			1
‘ one of the things @entity1 were fascinating by at all times was the notion of imitation , ’ said dr @entity18			2
‘ the idea that they could find auditory phenomena that could imitate emotion meant that the music had to feel like it had some kind of enhanced meaning			0
‘ some of it absolutely haunting but one of the things i feel most of all is that it ’s amazing to hear music that has n’t been heard for 2,000 years			0

musical rhythms were preserved in the patterns of words of ancient texts
instruments used are known from paintings and archaeological remains
ancient documents found on stone reveal how the pitch should have risen
dr @entity18 claims the ' magical ' recordings are 100 *%* accurate
