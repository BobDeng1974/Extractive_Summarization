model @entity0 has made history by landing a coveted @entity4 underwear campaign , even though she is considered plus - size by the fashion industry 's standards			1
at a @entity10 size 10 ( @entity12 size 14 ) , the 27 - year - old from @entity8 is too curvy for a standard sample size zero or two , but plus - size is traditionally classified as size 12 and up , putting her right in the middle			1
' it 's kind of confusing because i 'm a bigger girl , ' @entity19 , who stands at 5ft 11in , told @entity21			1
' i 'm not the biggest girl on the market but i 'm definitely bigger than all the girls [ @entity4 ] has ever worked with , so that is really intimidating			1
she says the ad , which also features the more ' straight - sized ' @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , is revolutionary in that it does n't address that fact that she is the lone ' plus - size ' model in the group			2
' i 'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and i 'm not large enough to be with the large girls , and i have n't been able to find my place , ' she explained			0
as such , ' this [ campaign ] was such a great feeling			0
' and yet some people have taken to @entity59 in outrage that she could even be considered a ' bigger ' girl			1
' @entity65 moment , ' one critic wrote in a tweet directed at @entity21			0
' this woman is described as " plus - size " and " a bigger girl "			1
another person said : ' i would n't consider her a plus size model			2
her height and her muscular tone should not categorize as a " big girl			2
" ' and a third commented angrily : ' how is that plus size ? ? ' watch more of @entity35 's interview at @entity79 's @entity78 standing pretty : @entity35 shows off her curves in a photo from her agency @entity82 up close : ' it 's kind of confusing because i 'm a bigger girl , ' says @entity35 , who stands at 5ft 11in			1
' i 'm not the biggest girl on the market but i 'm definitely bigger than all the girls [ @entity4 ] has ever worked with ' outcry : some critics have taken to @entity59 in outrage that she could even be considered a ' bigger ' girl in comparison : also featured in the campaign are @entity45 ( left ) and @entity43 ( right ) , who both fit the standard sample size despite the outcry , which seems to be directed at @entity21 rather than @entity4 , @entity35 says landing the campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry			1
' it 's not like [ @entity4 ] released this campaign and were like , ' whoa , look , there 's this plus - size girl in our campaign , '' she explained			1
' they released me in this campaign with everyone else ; there 's no distinction			2
it 's not a separate section for plus - size girls			1
' a statement released by the fashion house expresses the same sentiment			0
' the @entity39 line was created to celebrate and cater to the needs of different women , ' a spokesperson told @entity124			0
' and these images are intended to communicate that our new line is more inclusive and available in several silhouettes in an extensive range of sizes			0
' @entity35 , who is currently signed by @entity82 after being scouted at 16 when she was crowned @entity131 , has opened up in the past about being encouraged to lose weight in order to fit into the ' standard ' modeling size			1
the model , who also works as a performance artist , has spoken in the past about her darkest days when she found herself heading down a path of drugs and eating disorders			0
fitting in : despite the controversy , @entity35 says landing the @entity4 campaign has made her hopeful that size is becoming less of an issue in the fashion industry she told @entity147 in 2012 : ' i tried for a long time to make myself [ lose weight ]			1
i tried throwing up after i ate and that 's awful			0
that is painful - i would never wish for anyone to do that ever			0
' the model revealed that she would spend weeks eating nothing but calorie - free black olives and pickles and spending hours in the gym to try to slim down to a more typical model weight			0
she then gave up modelling for two years to concentrate on her studies but it was @entity166 who paved the way for her return as a plus - size girl			1
@entity35 said : ' they told me about plus modeling which was something i 'd never heard of before			0
in the middle : ' i 'm not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls and i 'm not large enough to be with the large girls ... ' this [ campaign ] was such a great feeling ' , explained @entity35 ( with model @entity180 ) ' but then they [ scouts @entity182 and @entity184 ] showed me , and this is when @entity166 was really starting to pick up speed , so i walked into @entity187 and the first thing @entity189 [ @entity190 ] said to me was , " you 're the next @entity166 , " and then they signed me			0
' but @entity35 has also noted that she is encouraged to have landed the @entity4 campaign , despite not fitting into the super-skinny mold			2
' look at the history of the brand , they launched @entity197 , and this is the woman who started this whole trend of waif , ' she told @entity202 earlier this year			0
' to see a brand like that embracing a greater range of sizes â€¦ it 's really special			0
' flashback : @entity4 has previously attracted ire for championing the ' heroin chic ' waifish look as exemplified by @entity197 in a 1992 ad ( pictured )			2

@entity0 is 5ft 11in and a @entity10 size 10 , which is a @entity12 size 14
said she 's ' definitely bigger than any girl @entity4 has ever worked with '
the 27 - year - old from @entity131 describes her body type as ' in the middle '
@entity59 users have expressed outrage she could be considered a ' bigger ' girl
