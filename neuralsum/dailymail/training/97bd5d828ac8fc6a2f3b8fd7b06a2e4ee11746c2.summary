a demolition crew made a spectacular blunder after it arrived at the right residential street , at the agreed time but then knocked down the wrong house			2
the property near @entity6 , @entity7 , had been in @entity9 's family for decades and belonged to his late grandmother			1
but when he visited the house on saturday , all that remained was a clean slab of concrete			0
this is all that remained of a house near @entity6 , @entity7 , after city contractors bulldozed it by mistake the property - at 9716 @entity23 - had been in @entity9 's family for decades and belonged to his late grandmother			1
it is pictured here four days before it was knocked down on july 12 and here 's the one that should have been demolished ... no. 9708 @entity23 ( above ) was the home intended for demolition			1
like mr @entity9 's house , it had been vacant for some time mr @entity9 , who works for a company that builds community centres , said : ' we came around @entity34 looking for the lot and my wife said , " @entity9 â€¦ i think the house is gone "			2
' we looked up there and sure enough , it 's gone ! ' he told my @entity41			0
@entity43 authorities , which had contracted the demolition team , admitted the blunder			2
' on july 12 , contractors demolished the wrong property on @entity23			2
@entity9 ( above ) has filed a claim for compensation with the city 's risk management department ' the property to be demolished should have been 9708 watercress dr. ' the property that was demolished was a vacant structure located at 9716 @entity58 , ' the city 's code compliance office said in a prepared statement			1
the confusion may have been due to the fact the @entity9 property , a three - bed ranch - style family house , was also vacant at the time			1
but that is scant consolation for mr @entity9 and his wife , who planned to refurbish the home and move in			1
among items of theirs destroyed were a desk , some books and an antique mirror			0
according to a neighbour , 9708 was condemned and had been awaiting demolition since january			0
the same person notified the authorities after seeing bulldozers knocking down the wrong house on friday morning			0
