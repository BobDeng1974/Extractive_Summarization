it 's the most prestigious tournament in ice hockey - so when you win it , there 's only one way to celebrate			1
@entity6 champions the @entity7 have toasted their 2011 victory with a staggering $ 156,679.74 bar bill at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 on saturday night - and that was n't even the full team , but just six of its apparently hardiest members			1
however $ 56,679.74 of the tab went on the players working up the @entity19 courage to make one final order that will go down in history : a $ 100,000 bottle of @entity23			1
congratulations to @entity25 : @entity7 player @entity26 ( right ) drinks from the @entity6 as team mate @entity28 just drinks straight from the the $ 100,000 bottle of @entity23 getting my groove on : @entity31 shows he 's got some moves off the ice also there are just six of the 30 - litre bottles in existence - well , five now			1
made by luxury brand @entity37 and produced by @entity38 , it is the largest bottle of luxury @entity39 in the world			1
the gold metallic bottles are crafted entirely by hand , inspired by fashion designer @entity44			1
debauchery : the players quickly ended up dancing on the bar @entity48 - style			1
right , the reason they thought that was ok - their bar tab making new friends : @entity31 poses with some @entity7 fans inside the nightclub each have two @entity23 insignias and four hand - applied pewter lables			2
they are housed in a black wooden case , lined with velvet and fitted with an engraved nameplate			2
each is embossed with the @entity39 's royal crest			2
the bottle ordered by the @entity7 was hand - delivered by @entity66 owners @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
and the losers : rioters torched cars and looted shops in @entity74 after the city 's @entity75 lost the @entity77 of course there was only one cup that was prestigious enough to drink such a drink from			1
photographs capture player @entity26 drinking the golden liquid straight from the bowl of the @entity6			2
thing of beauty : the @entity39 bottle - one of which was ordered by the @entity7 on saturday night his team mate @entity28 , meanwhile , is pictured drinking straight from the gold bottle - which is so big that he needed assistance holding it up			0
images of the joyful , debauchery - filled celebration are in direct contrast to scenes pictured in defeated @entity74 last week			1
the @entity75 lost 4 - 0 to the @entity7 in @entity97 of the tournament - sparking violent riots in the @entity102 @entity101 city			0
police squared off against angry youths who burned cars and destroyed store fronts in savage demonstrations last week			0
a photograph of one couple lying on the ground kissing in the midst of the riots has become the iconic image of the violence after they declared they had been beaten by police			0
but in @entity118 there was nothing but joy			0
and despite hangovers that must have rivalled those portrayed in the @entity123 , the players still managed to make it to @entity125 on sunday to be honoured by the @entity126			0
the @entity128 bottle was signed by every member of the team there - including @entity131 , @entity26 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity31 and @entity28			0
it will be on display at @entity136 and is set to be raffled off to benefit the @entity7 foundation			0
the first @entity128 bottle also sold for $ 100,000 at a casino - at the famous nightclub @entity141 in the @entity142 in @entity143			0
most expensive drink purchase : ace of @entity147 champagne at $ 100,000 when they ordered the @entity128 : as their final act , after downing $ 56,679.74 of wine , liquor and beer ( presumably making it seem like a very good idea at the time ) least expensive drink purchase : @entity158 at $ 5 ( but they ordered 136 of them ... bringing the total just on @entity162 to $ 680 ) proof they were n't afraid to mix their liquors : @entity166 included various different flavours of @entity169 rum , @entity170 , @entity172 vodka , @entity174 whiskey , captain @entity176 's spiced rum , @entity177 , along with ( of course ) multiple beers and champagnes most popular drink : @entity158 ( well , they are hockey players after all ) least popular drink : @entity185 water ( just $ 268 of the total bar bill - but $ 268 wisely spent ) service charges : an incredible $ 24,869.80			0
