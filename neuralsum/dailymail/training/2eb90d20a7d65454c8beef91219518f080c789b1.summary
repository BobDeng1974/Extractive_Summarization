by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 mp has called for the resignation of sir @entity5 for ' presiding over a culture of secrecy and cover - up that cost many people their lives '			1
@entity11 , one of whose constituents died in the @entity15 hospital scandal , said the @entity17 chief executive should quit because of his involvement in the controversy			1
between 400 and 1,200 died needlessly between 2005 and 2008 because bosses at the @entity21 put meeting @entity24 government targets ahead of patient safety			0
time to go : the @entity26 has called sir @entity5 to account over the @entity15 hospital scandal sir @entity5 was previously head of @entity28 between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising @entity15 – but failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care			1
in fact at the height of the scandal , he wrote a letter congratulating managers having toured the trust 's two hospitals , @entity39 and @entity40			2
@entity3 mp @entity11 , one of whose constituents died in the scandal , has called on sir @entity5 to resign sir @entity5 insists he is ' not ashamed ' to still be in his job and has blamed failings on the ' whole system '			1
but nine out of ten @entity17 staff believe he should quit his £ 270,000 - a - year post , two polls revealed last week			1
in an article published today , mr @entity11 , who represents @entity49 , also attacks the ' culture of cosy cover - ups ' in the @entity17 including the gagging orders imposed on doctors , nurses and managers			1
last week the @entity26 revealed that in only three years there were 598 ' special severance payments ' , almost all of which carried draconian confidentiality clauses aimed at silencing whistleblowers			0
they cost the taxpayer £ 14.7million			0
mr @entity11 said : ' i think it is very difficult to lead an organisation where 90 per cent of the staff do not have confidence in you , so he should consider his position			2
' he writes on the @entity72 website : ' it is becoming increasingly clear that a culture of cosy cover - ups has been allowed to develop in the @entity17 and that is something that has got to change			0
' whilst i have no doubt that sir @entity5 is committed and knowledgeable about the @entity17 , you can not get away from the fact that he has presided over a culture of secrecy and cover up that has cost many people their lives			1
' can a man so embroiled in this culture really be the person to oversee what health secretary @entity86 calls a new culture of openness and transparency ... to ensure we never repeat the mistakes ' ? ' shocking : @entity93 was one of two where between 400 and 1,200 patients died needlessly mr @entity11 's article concludes : ' failing like this would not be tolerated in a private hospital and they should not be tolerated within the @entity17			2
' in the private sector , management would have been held accountable			0
we need to usher in a new era of transparency and candour if we are to address failures of care within the @entity17			0
' mr @entity11 's constituents include the family of @entity110 , 20 , who died in 2006 from internal bleeding which was not picked up by doctors in @entity115 's @entity114 unit			2
he had fallen off his mountain bike and ruptured his spleen			0
he was vomiting and in agony but was diagnosed with a few fractured ribs and sent home with painkillers			0
he died hours later at his home in @entity123 , @entity49			0
he also believes @entity24 health secretary @entity124 should have held a public inquiry into the failings at @entity15 , which may have brought these to light earlier			2
failure : sir @entity5 even wrote letters congratulating the hospitals ' managers at the height of the scandal it has emerged that mr @entity124 rejected 81 requests for a full public inquiry in the last year of @entity24 's government 2009 - 10 , 20 from @entity139 and the others from the public , victims and organisations			1
mr @entity11 's intervention is significant because he is a @entity3 mp and his call for sir @entity5 to quit goes against @entity146 , who seems determined to prop him up			1
the prime minister said last week that sir @entity5 has his full backing and that he ' does a very good job '			1
mr @entity146 said : ' it seemed to me that he had properly apologised and acknowledged the mistakes that the regional health authority had made			0
' we should not be seeking scapegoats and i think to highlight @entity5 in that way would be seeking a scapegoat			0
