@entity1 mayor @entity0 has handed the @entity2 her journal and other documents she claims prove @entity5 threatened to withhold @entity7 aid to her unless she supported one of his development projects			1
@entity0 released a statement sunday night revealing she spent ' hours ' with lawyers discussing the latest controversy to hit the @entity14 governor			1
' as they pursue this investigation , i will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the lieutenant governor came to @entity1 and told me that @entity7 aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project , ' she said in the statement			1
cut off : @entity1 mayor @entity0 claims @entity7 relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal earlier , she told @entity27 that it was ' stunning ' and ' outrageous , ' but true , that lieutenant governor @entity28 approached her in a parking lot in may to deliver the threat , stating that it was ' a direct message from the governor			1
' ' i stand by my word , ' she told @entity27 's @entity35			0
@entity37 @entity14 assemblyman @entity36 says he will expand an existing investigation into @entity0 's allegations			2
he 's already investigating traffic jams at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity14 , allegedly orchestrated by @entity5 aides as political payback			0
the damning accusations , which @entity5 's administration vehemently denies , came as the governor left his ' bridge-gate ' troubles behind and flew to @entity49 to campaign for a fellow @entity50			0
@entity0 alleged that @entity51 and another aide , community affairs commissioner @entity52 , leaned on her to gain support for the lucrative deal			2
tough week : governor @entity5 gives the state address on january 14 , as his administration is hit by accusations over ' bridge-gate ' ' the bottom line is , it 's not fair for the governor to hold @entity7 funds hostage for the @entity63 of @entity1 because he wants me to give back to one private developer , ' she told @entity66			1
@entity7 devastated nearly 80 per cent of the @entity1 community in 2012 , and @entity5 had immediately promised its residents that he would ' be here to help '			2
but when @entity0 requested $ 127 million in relief aid , she was given just $ 142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator , and $ 200,000 in recovery grants from a $ 1.8 million fund , @entity66 reported			1
in a letter written to @entity5 about the low funds , @entity0 wrote : ' please governor , we need your help			2
i have tried to assure @entity1 residents that we would be treated fairly			0
' no response has been received from the letter , which was dated may 8 , 2013 - the same day the city 's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for the @entity90			0
according to emails , public records and her diary entries , @entity0 claims @entity5 's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor - backed plans			1
the project , a mass redevelopment proposed by the @entity90 , was already in the pipeline when @entity0 was elected as mayor			1
wrecked : huge parts of @entity1 were flooded when @entity7 hit in october 2012 aid : a @entity1 shop tries to run without any power after the storm in 2012 the lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies			2
@entity0 told @entity66 she was n't against the plan , but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place			1
but when the study and @entity1 board rejected the need for redevelopment , much - needed @entity7 relief money was cut off , @entity0 claims			1
according to a diary entry from the mayor , @entity51 pulled her aside during an event in @entity1 on may 13 , last year			2
the diary entry read : ' she pulls me aside with no one else around and says that i need to move forward with the @entity131 project			0
it is very important to the governor			0
' " the word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you			0
i know it 's not right – these things should not be connected – but they are , " she says , and " if you tell anyone , i will deny it			0
" ' then , in a diary entry for may 17 , @entity0 claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the @entity7 recovery , commissioner @entity52 leaned in and told her ' everyone in the @entity149 believes you are against [ the @entity131 project ]			1
' @entity0 denied she was against it , but commissioner @entity52 then allegedly told her : ' if you move that forward , the money would start flowing to you			1
' claims : @entity5 with @entity155 commissioner @entity52 , who allegedly leaned on @entity0 to support a project in return for more @entity7 aid ' pressure ' : lieutenant governor @entity28 allegedly told mayor @entity0 if she did n't move forward with the project , the administration would not be able to help her spokesmen for governor @entity5 and community affairs commissioner constable have denied the allegations			1
a spokeswoman for the commissioner said : ' mayor @entity0 's allegation that on may 16 , 2013 , commissioner @entity52 conditioned @entity1 's receipt of @entity7 aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false			1
' the governor 's spokesman , @entity173 , released a statement that read : ' mayor @entity0 has been effusive in her public praise of the @entity177 and the assistance we 've provided in terms of economic development and @entity7 aid			2
' ' what or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone 's guess			0
' a spokesman for the @entity188 said : ' we have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation			0
if it turns out to be true it would be deplorable			0
' despite the ' bridge-gate ' scandal , many @entity50 have come to governor @entity5 's defense and praised him for taking action			0
others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate .			0

@entity0 said she met with the @entity2 for several hours sunday regarding the accusations
she claims she was awarded only $ *320,000* of the $ 127m she requested in *hurricane* relief funds
@entity1 mayor said she was told more money would come if she backed a lucrative @entity131 redevelopment plan
