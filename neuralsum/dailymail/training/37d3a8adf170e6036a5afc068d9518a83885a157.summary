by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 18:50 est , 17 april 2013 vandalising cars , attacking the elderly and head - butting windows , @entity1 has become notorious in his home village			1
the yob in question ? not a feral teen but a very territorial pheasant			2
residents of @entity11 in @entity12 spoke of their despair yesterday at the bird ’s behaviour , with some saying they ca n’t leave their home for fear of being pecked and chased			1
he waits throughout the day and night and swoops when the family dares to emerge			1
when they are inside , he head - butts the windows and has even tried to break into the front door			2
the attacks have got so bad miss @entity19 is scared of leaving home without gloves and a badminton racquet to fend him off			1
@entity22 said she has tried to befriend the bird by feeding him crumbs of corn bread but the attacks have continued regardless she claims to have been stalked for the past four months , with the bird specifically targeting her family			1
experts said this is probably because @entity1 has become confused , seeing her as a rival male pheasant			2
miss @entity19 , a medical secretary , said : ‘ sometimes i go from one room into another , and he will run round the outside of the house following my movements			1
' he even tries to get into the house – it ’s like something from a @entity58 film			0
@entity19 faces up to her feathery rival with her defence @entity60 - a badminton racquet ‘ often when we get in the car , he will appear from nowhere and either jump on the car or start pecking it			1
' he runs alongside as we drive away , pecking and head - butting the wheels			0
’ the family has resorted to leaving out food for @entity1 in the hope he might stop seeing them as enemies			2
@entity73 and @entity74 in @entity75			0
@entity73 was told mechanical birds would be used for the violent attack scenes			0
instead , she endured five solid days of being pecked by live gulls , ravens and crows ouch : the bird 's sharp beak pecks @entity19 ‘ a couple of times in the last two weeks i have tried to befriend him , feeding him crumbs of corn bread , which he loves , ’ miss @entity19 added			1
‘ but he has no gratitude and is always ready to attack			0
pheasants are normally just rather dopey birds – but this one is a nutter			0
’ @entity94 , from the @entity93 , said the bird was displaying typical mating season behaviour			0
‘ he obviously sees her as a rival male , ’ he added .			0
