@entity0 has leapt to the defence of @entity2 after @entity3 ’s crushing one - day defeat by @entity5 in @entity6 was followed by renewed demands for his resignation			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 all called for @entity2 to quit after the @entity12 moved with embarrassing ease into a 2 - 0 lead in the seven - match series			1
but @entity0 , whose enterprising half - century stood out in a sorry display , said @entity2 was not the only struggling batsman in @entity3 ’s one - day side			1
in a formulation that has become familiar , @entity0 insisted : ‘ he ’s quite a strong character			1
he ’ll come out the other side			2
’ @entity0 ( right ) has described @entity3 captain @entity2 as a ' fighter ' who can prove doubters wrong the statistics are beginning to stack up against @entity2 ( second from right ) with @entity0 pictured on the far left if @entity3 keep losing and @entity2 keeps failing , his position as one - day captain will come under serious pressure			1
if @entity3 do dispense with his services , expect @entity30 to replace him as opener and @entity32 to replace him as captain for the @entity35 @entity34 in february , even though the @entity36 also looks out of form			1
few doubt @entity2 ’s mental strength			1
but his lack of runs and @entity3 ’s faltering preparations for the @entity35 , now less than three months away , appear to be a concern only to those outside the dressing - room			1
@entity2 ’s scratchy 22 in 37 balls on saturday meant he has scored only one half - century in 16 innings since guiding @entity3 to the final of the @entity49 on home soil in june 2013			1
and – with the surprising exception of @entity52 – that record compares unfavourably with the rest of the current top seven over the same period			2
in 16 innings since the @entity49 , @entity2 has averaged 29 , with a lowly strike - rate per 100 balls of 71			1
only @entity59 averages fewer ( 27 ) , but none of the top seven has scored more slowly than the captain @entity0 finds it easy to retain faith in a cricketer like captain cook who has a career trait of resilience @entity0 had to try to prove his point again after being dropped by @entity3 for the home series against @entity70 by contrast , @entity71 is averaging 43 with a strike - rate of almost 107 , while @entity75 ’s figures are 40 and 115			1
even @entity76 , whose place has been questioned while the likes of @entity30 and @entity79 wait for their chance , has been scoring at 90 runs per 100 balls			2
@entity0 , though , was toeing a loyal line			1
‘ one thing we must remember , it ’s not just @entity2 who has n’t scored over the past few games , ’ he said			1
‘ there ’s been a lot of us			2
‘ he is our captain			2
he ’s done it in the past			2
i remember him scoring two hundreds on the bounce in the @entity92			2
he can play , and i ’m sure that form will turn around			0
’ @entity2 will have to do so without the help of batting coach @entity95 , who on sunday night left the tour as per his part - time deal with the @entity98			1
@entity3 ’s top seven since the @entity100 , ordered by average @entity3 captain cook looks on after misfielding a ball during the second odi against @entity5 @entity3 have lost 15 of their 25 odis since they were beaten by @entity70 at home in the final of the @entity49 in june 2013			1
they have won just nine , with one no result			0
asked about the views of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity9 – who tweeted ‘ @entity111 , if you care about @entity3 's chances this winter , pls resign and just concentrate on @entity114 ... ‪ # @entity115 ’ – @entity0 was philosophical			1
‘ everyone ’s entitled to their opinion , ’ he said			0
‘ in @entity121 culture , we ’re quite quick to jump on something that has n’t gone right			0
what ’s happened to @entity2 over the past year has definitely made him stronger			2
he smiles a lot more now than he ever did			0
i think he ’s in a good place			0
’ @entity0 himself may be in a better place than when @entity3 dropped him for the home one - day series against @entity70 at the end of the summer			1
he has begun this series with a pair of fifties , and worked out more quickly than his colleagues that saturday ’s pitch required careful accumulation – not the gung - ho strokeplay that scuppered @entity3 ’s top order			1
‘ getting dropped against @entity70 was a shock , ’ he said			0
‘ i remember the phonecall quite clearly			0
i did n’t really want to tell anyone , to be honest			0
i was a little bit embarrassed			0
@entity2 ( second from right ) has overseen seven one - day international defeats in @entity3 's last eight matches ‘ i get dropped a lot , actually			1
i think i come back wiser every time , and a little bit more independent			0
that ’s the key to playing cricket at this level : you ’ve got to be very independent and not be so coach - driven			2
’ after being given a run at @entity154 in 2012 , @entity0 ’s role in the one - day side has been as a finisher , or a repairer of innings , from no 6 or 7			1
his natural gifts are well suited to both tasks , but he is clearly underwhelmed by the designation			0
‘ i ’d like to bat a bit higher , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s an ok role			0
it ’s not a glorious role			0
you ’re not quite a main batter or a main bowler			0
at @entity168 i play as a main batsman – that ’s how i like to be viewed			0
but the role i ’m given – there ’s nothing i can do about it			0
‘ i could do with a little bit of help down the back end , i think			0
it would be nice to be batting with someone like @entity75 or @entity32			0
’ right now , these are luxuries @entity3 may not be in a position to consider .			2

@entity2 has overseen seven odi defeats in @entity3 's last eight
@entity0 has been a team - mate of @entity2 's for more than 15 years
he *labels* @entity3 captain cook a ' fighter ' who can prove doubters wrong
