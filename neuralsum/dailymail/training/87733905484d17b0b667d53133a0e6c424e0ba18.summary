by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:12 est , 28 february 2014 a budget hotel is being used to accommodate patients at a leading @entity6 hospital in a bid to free up beds			1

the @entity12 in @entity10 is putting patients up in a local @entity9 , new figures have revealed due to pressure on beds , doctors at the @entity12 are being asked to assess whether patients need hospital - level care or whether they are well enough to stay in the hotel , the @entity28 reports			1
figures made available to the local paper revealed that in 2010 262 patients stayed at the @entity9			2
in 2012 and 2013 the total figure was 1,900			0

managers at the hotel , in @entity42 , also explained that the rooms the hospital uses have no extra access to emergency equipment than any other room does			2
in 2012 and 2013 the @entity6 hospital spent £ 500,000 putting 1,900 patients up in the budget hotel the @entity12 says it only uses the @entity9 ( pictured ) for the convenience and comfort of patients despite this , the @entity12 argues that the strategy does not affect the quality of care received by patients			1
they say they offer hotel rooms purely for the convenience of patients who live a long way from the hospital so are not able to easily go home for the night			1
a spokesperson said : ‘ the @entity12 offers a range of specialist services and our patients travel from all over the @entity72 to receive treatment			0
' some of the treatment will last more than one day , but overnight medical care is not required			0
' for those patients living far from @entity6 , rather than ask them to travel home or have them stay in hospital overnight , we offer them a room in a nearby hotel			1
' patients might also be offered a room in a hotel if they have an operation scheduled very early in the morning			0
the hotel , which @entity88 is the face of , said the rooms used for patients are no different to any other rooms			0
it said they contain no special equipment for patients the hospital says only patients who are well enough not to need overnight care are offered a hotel room and that it means they get have a more comfortable night than they would in a hospital bed ' only patients who do not need overnight care will be offered a room in a hotel and our staff always carefully assess patients before making this decision			1
this ensures patient safety is never compromised			0
' the rise in patient hotel stays is due to a new approach we took , which included looking carefully at how and where patients were cared for to ensure they were receiving care in the most appropriate setting			0
' we found that there were many patients who did not need to stay in hospital , for the reasons outlined above , and so we implemented new guidelines to ensure only patients in need of 24/7 nursing care stay in wards overnight to free up hospital beds for those who need them			1
' in addition , it means a more comfortable stay for patients who do n’t need to be in hospital overnight			2
