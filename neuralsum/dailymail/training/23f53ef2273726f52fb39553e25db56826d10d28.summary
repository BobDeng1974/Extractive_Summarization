by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:27 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 18:27 est , 6 june 2013 the @entity2 has refused to ban websites showing simulated violent scenes of child abuse and rape , insisting there is ‘ no evidence ’ to link them to the actual crimes			1
in a letter to concerned charities , an official played down the suggestion that websites purporting to show rape can lead users to commit sex offences			1
@entity19 said : ‘ we note what you say about such images potentially glorifying sexual violence			0
however , we are not convinced that evidence for this is any more than anecdotal and can not , therefore , be used to justify a change in the law			2
’ inspired to kill : @entity29 , right , who was last week jailed for the murder of @entity29 , and @entity32 , left , who murdered 12 - year - old @entity32 , both progressed from viewing child porn to committing child murder the letter came after charities wrote to the @entity2 asking it to consider reclassifying such simulation sites as illegal			1
they are already banned in @entity42			0
last week the @entity43 revealed research which shows that one in six men who view child porn go on to abuse youngsters			2
the @entity2 ’s response emerged a week after @entity29 was given a life sentence for the murder of five - year - old @entity29			1
he had collected a ‘ library ’ of sickening images			0
both he and @entity32 , who murdered 12 - year - old @entity32 , had no previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to committing child murder			1
but the department ’s dismissive response seemed to contradict its own evidence assessment , which pointed out that rapists ‘ are much more aroused by depictions of coercion than non-criminals ’ and that ‘ one third of rapists report using forced sexual depictions as part of their deliberate pre-offence preparation ’			0
sites which show actual rape and child abuse are banned under existing pornography legislation			2
but those purporting to show simulated rape and child abuse are not illegal in @entity78 and @entity79			2
more than 100 campaigners have written to @entity81 , urging him to ban depictions of ‘ rape or other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity ’			0
anyone found downloading such images would be committing an offence			0
a spokesman for the @entity2 said : ‘ we share the public ’s concern about the availability of harmful content on the internet and have already taken steps to ensure there are better online filters to protect children			1
' but we want to look at what more can be done and so the @entity100 has invited internet providers to a summit this month			0

child killers @entity29 and @entity105 both viewed sick porn online before going on to commit murder
but @entity2 official says links between violent pornography and *subsequent* sex crimes are no more than anecdotal
