by @entity0 published : 13:17 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 14 march 2013 an innocuous rugby tackle led to @entity2 suffering kidney injuries worse than a ' 70mph car crash victim ' a rugby player has made a miraculous recovery after shattering his kidney in four places following an innocuous tackle			1
@entity2 , 22 , had his kidney ' disintegrated ' when a rival player accidentally kneed him in the back as they both went for the ball in the last minute of a match earlier this month			1
he was left with injuries that doctors described as ' worse than a 70mph car crash victim			0
' paramedics rushed to the playing ground of @entity20 after he was left paralysed on the ground as the side of his body swelled up			0
@entity2 was taken to @entity24 where doctors feared for his life when he developed a huge blood clot			1
as they performed emergency surgery to remove the broken organ , he lost six pints of blood			1
and despite being told he would be in hospital for over a month - the burly full - back was back home in just six days			2
today he described how he dived towards the ball in the dying seconds of the game while playing for @entity37 against @entity38 , which they went on to win 54 - 19			0
@entity2 , a commercial finance analyst , from @entity24 , said : ' it was the last play of the game , the ball was kicked over the top and as full back i had to go and smother it			1
' i knew i was n't going to get to the ball so i dived towards it and the opposition player came in from the side with his knees as every player does in that situation			2
' it 's a tackle i 've made millions of times before , completely innocuous			0
i just realised i could n't move and knew something was bad			0
' when the paramedics arrived they gave me gas and air and pain killers but i just could n't move			0
' one of our coaches is ex-navy and has seen these kinds of things before and he could see there was internal bleeding as my side was all puffy			0
' when they got me to hospital and i had a @entity69 scan it showed my kidney was in four pieces			2
' i lost six pints of blood before and during surgery but they managed to patch me up			1
i 'm never allowed to play rugby again on doctors orders as i only have one kidney left			1
@entity2 ( here on the left ) suffered his horrific injuries when a rival player accidentally kneed him in the back as they both went for the ball in the last minute of a match emergency : @entity2 lost six pints of blood before and during surgery			1
he has since been told it is too risky to keep playing rugby , as he now only has one kidney ' i 've been lucky with injuries playing rugby for all my life with barely any injuries			1
then one really innocuous challenge and my kidney disintegrates			2
' @entity99 , the first team coach at @entity20 , said : ' i 've never seen or heard of an injury that bad on a rugby pitch			2
' i went to the hospital with @entity2 and the doctor said he 'd seen people who 'd been in 70mph car crashes with less damage than that			1
' his concerned father , @entity108 , 52 , described his son 's escape as a ' miracle '			0
he added : ' he has made a lot of progress thanks to fantastic hospital staff			0
' in terms of fitness , he 's getting better all the time and should be absolutely fine			0
' but he 's only got one kidney left now and he ca n't risk damage to that one			2
i expect it will be non-contact sports for the rest of his life now - but it 's a miracle he 's still here			0

@entity2 , 22 , was accidentally kneed in the back by a rival player
