the past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,050 even before the @entity5 plane vanished			1
two incidents involving @entity9 planes - one over eastern @entity10 and the other in the @entity12 - led to the deaths of 537 people , while an @entity16 crash in @entity17 killed 116 and @entity19 crash in @entity20 killed a further 49 people			1
the remaining 456 fatalities were largely in incidents involving small commercial planes or private aircraft operating on behalf of companies , governments or organisations			1
despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade , the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - totalling just 111 across the whole world over the past 12 months			1
the all - time deadliest year for aviation was 1972 when a staggering 2,429 people were killed in a total of 55 plane crashes - including the crash of @entity41 , which killed 174 people in @entity43 , and @entity44 , which claimed 155 lives in @entity46			1
however this year 's total death count of 1,212 , including those presumed dead on board the missing @entity5 flight , marks a significant rise on the very low 265 fatalities in 2013 - which led to it being named the safest year in aviation since the end of the @entity55			1
in total more than half the people killed in aviation incidents this year had been flying on board @entity75 - registered planes			1
in january a total of 12 people lost their lives in five separate incidents , while the same number of crashes in february killed 107			1
there were only three fatal incidents in march , but the still - unexplained incident involving @entity93 left 239 people dead , bringing the total to 248			2
april saw two incidents with a total of 10 people killed , before a spike in incidents in may saw five fatal crashes leading to 35 people losing their lives , and seven crashes in june killed 64			1
july was by far the worst month for aviation fatalities this year , with a @entity9 plane being shot down over eastern @entity10 killing 298 people , 116 people dying in an @entity16 downing in @entity17 , and 48 dead in the @entity19 crash in @entity20			2
two other crashes killed six people bringing the total dead in airline incidents in july to 468			2
in august five crashes led to the deaths of 60 people , before a decline in september saw three downed planes and 12 killed , and three october incidents resulted in the deaths of 10 people			2
a further two crashes in november saw 11 people lose their lives			0
before the disappearance of the @entity5 flight there had already been three fatal plane crashes this month , killing 13 people			1
@entity5 flight @entity126 had 155 passengers on board and seven crew - all of whom are missing and feared to be dead			0
@entity131 : the remains of @entity9 flight @entity133 is seen after being shot down over eastern @entity10 horror : 298 people were killed when @entity9 flight @entity137 was shot out of the sky in july despite the heavy death toll , 2014 actually had the lowest number of crashes since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - just 111 in the past 12 months			1
' it will probably come as a surprise to most people , but really it was a very safe year , ' @entity143 , of the flight consultancy business @entity145 told the @entity149			0
over the past 65 years , the aviation accident rate has been declining rapidly , despite more and more people taking to the skies every year			0
the current crash rate is 2.1 for every million planes that takes the skies - with the odds even lower on large commercial aircraft			0
however the distressing disappearance of @entity5 flight @entity126 is the latest installment in @entity162 's checkered airline history which has seen the deaths of almost 650 people in 20 years			2
the nation has struggled with its air safety record over the past two decades as the airline market in @entity168 faced unparalleled demand for low - cost flights from a rapidly expanding population			0
while @entity162 has benefited economically from the growing market , it is struggling to meet safety standards , unable provide enough qualified pilots , mechanics , air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety			0
there were only three fatal incidents in march , but the still - unexplained incident involving @entity93 left 239 people dead , bringing the total to 248			2
pictured , rescue workers search for @entity93 carnage : 48 people were killed when a @entity19 plane crashed in @entity20 in july despite 30 per cent of plane crashes around the world occurring as a result of weather conditions , ground - based wind - shear detection systems introduced to notify plane crews to issues are absent in many airports around @entity162			1
the nation of over 250 million people is set in a region which ' needs to look at improving air infrastructure and pursue an open skies policy , ' mr @entity197 told @entity203			0
the @entity204 recorded a 20 % increase in seat volume between 2012 and 2013 , totalling 5.6 million passengers on flights in the region			0
the figures are expected to increase , with 70 % of the world 's busiest routes travelling through @entity168 , and 30 % of the world 's aircraft passengers expected to travel to the region in 2014 , reported @entity216			0
crash site : another incident in july saw an @entity16 plane come down in @entity17 116 people died in the @entity16 crash earlier this year			0
the plane crashed in the same month as @entity133 @entity197 , co-founder of @entity223 , said that ' increasing air traffic means crashes will increase as well			0
' in the past 20 years 532 people have died in crashes in @entity162 , and 116 people have been presumed dead			0
in 2014 so far there have been five major plane crashes in @entity168 , including the doomed @entity230 17 en route to @entity232 , and the disappearance of @entity93 en route to @entity235 from @entity232			2
there has been one major flight incident in @entity162 annually for the past three years , including the disappearance of the @entity5 flight on sunday which was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members on board			0
