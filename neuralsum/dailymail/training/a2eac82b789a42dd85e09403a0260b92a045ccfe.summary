by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 14:30 est , 23 march 2012 for those with an aversion of @entity4 and cosmetic surgery – it could be the perfect solution			1
a new alternative to going under the knife and the needle is set to go sale on the @entity11 high street this week			2
it contains extracts of the @entity15 ' miracle herb ' @entity14 , which is dubbed ' magic grass ' by people in @entity18 because of its anti-aging qualities			2
the @entity21 range , which has developed a cult following in the @entity23 is to go on sale exclusively at @entity24 such is the hype surrounding the @entity21 24 - 7 range , it sold $ 200,000 on its first day in @entity23 , while hundreds of women have pre-ordered it here			1
its instant @entity30 has been dubbed ' @entity4 in a jar ' and has been scientifically proven to reduce lines and wrinkles in minutes			1
@entity24 will sell the entire range but a spokesman described the wrinkle treatment , which costs £ 40 for 10 ml , as the ' hero product '			1
the cream has been on sale in the @entity11 some years ago , but this is the first time the full range will be on sale - and it is exclusive to the department store			1
@entity24 spokesman added @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 were among the star fans of creams			1
actresses @entity46 , right , and @entity49 are said to be fans of the cream the @entity54 has been tested independently by the @entity55 which found consumers experienced as much as a 90 per cent reduction in wrinkles within ten minutes			1
the initial effects are temporary but the clinical trials also found that those using it for more than 28 days said they noticed their lines were softer – even after they stopped using the product			2
freeze 24/7 counts @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 as fans cosmetics supervisor @entity67 , who first bought the product in @entity23 , said : ‘ i have tried most of the age defying and anti-wrinkle creams ever produced , and i firmly believed that they are all of a " muchness " regardless of price			2
' but i was astounded when i tried it and watched my deep wrinkles disappear , and with regular use they have softened altogether			1
' they say the proof is in the pudding , and from i started using it , my friends and colleagues have asked me am i using a different foundation or have i had a facial treatment			2
’ the @entity54 combines the @entity86 , which is a muscle relaxant found naturally in the body , with extracts of the herb @entity14			2
used in @entity15 medicine it is an anti-oxidant and boosts circulation and the immune system			0
combined in this cream , the @entity96 complex has a short term effect where muscles are relaxed on the face giving the appearance of smoother skin at the surface , while the @entity14 has a longer term effect boosting skin cell renewal			1
the @entity23 website for the product has a number of before and after photographs to illustrate the products ' effect the treatment also has pomegranate and tangerine extracts , which are also anti-oxidants			0
it comes at a time when many people are turning their back on @entity4 and opting to try and find non- invasive alternatives			1
@entity120 , @entity121 , and @entity122 are among those who have tried the treatment but were put off by the pain or the effect it had on their faces			0
the market in the forehead freezing drug is worth almost £ 18 million in the @entity11 alone			0
but recent research revealed that one of side - effects is that if you use it a lot , or have it injected by an inexperienced practitioner , @entity4 can actually give you wrinkles			1
cosmetic experts have noted that knocking out some of the facial muscles can bring others into play , which could cause lines in places where it has not been injected			0
@entity145 : ' instant improvement ' she says : the @entity147 has really improved my skin			0
the results are almost instant and i ’ve noticed a reduction in furrow lines and wrinkles			1
my skin has a radiant glow			0
i do n’t want fillers or any injections so this is a good alternative			1
people do comment on how young i look and how healthy my skin looks			0
you do n’t need a lot to make it work for you and compared to cosmetic procedures it is really good value			0
there ’s a lot of pressure for women to stay looking good but i also want to feel good within myself			0
these days 50 is the new 30 and people put a lot of effort into keeping youthful			0
i think it ’s a great product			0
i used to order it through friends in @entity23 so i ’m really pleased it ’s here			0
@entity176 : ' surprisingly effective ' she says : i was offered a trial and was surprised by how effective this cream is			2
i do n’t feel ready for things like @entity4 or chemical peels			1
i do n’t like the sound of them so i was looking for something different			0
it ’s an affordable option compared to fillers and my skin looks smoother and softer after i ’ve used it			0
with this the change in my face was almost immediate – i like that i can look in the mirror and see a difference			0
when you put the cream it almost has a numbing effect but colleagues and friends have commented on how good i look			2
the @entity21 24 - 7 range is available on sale exclusively at @entity24 from march 28 .			1

launch of cream at @entity24 follows recent research *claiming* @entity4 injections can actually give you wrinkles
