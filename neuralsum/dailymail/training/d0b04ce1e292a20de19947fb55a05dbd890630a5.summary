@entity0 continued their impressive start to @entity3 qualification with a 5 - 0 thumping win against @entity5 on thursday night			1
only 55,990 fans attended @entity0 's emphatic victory against their opponents though , making it the lowest - ever crowd for a @entity0 ' match since the opening of the new @entity13 in 2007			1
@entity15 's @entity14 provides his match zone analysis			2
@entity0 ran out comfortable 5 - 0 winners against @entity5 in their @entity3 qualifier on thursday night @entity0 players have now started to embrace each other , arms around each other ’ s shoulders , when singing the national anthem			1
it ’s taking a bit of time to catch on , however			0
captain @entity28 led the way and players followed suit down the line			0
but for a while @entity33 and @entity34 were left , cut adrift at the end of the line – not quite the intended message of unity and togetherness – until they finally noticed and join in the team bonding			0
@entity28 ( left ) , @entity43 ( centre ) and @entity45 ( right ) embrace during the national anthem goalkeeper @entity47 was n’t doing @entity5 ’s credibility at this level an awful lot of good when almost his first intervention was to give away a free kick inside his own penalty area for handling the ball twice – an error more akin to @entity56			2
his desperate fling at @entity58 , which ended with him head butting the @entity61 defender ’s back - side as @entity0 opened the scoring , did n’t help matters			1
the accountant at last partially redeemed himself with a fine save from @entity65 on 42 minutes			0
@entity5 goalkeeper @entity47 endured a torrid evening against @entity0 at @entity13 ‘ four @entity69 players in the @entity0 ’s starting line - up , ’ tweeted @entity67			1
‘ never thought i ’d utter those words			0
’ ( strictly speaking he did n’t utter them : he wrote them )			0
@entity65 , @entity33 , @entity76 and @entity45 were the men on thursday night and @entity78 made a fifth when he came on at half time			1
back in february , 1999 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 started against world champions @entity85 at @entity13			2
it did n’t do any good mind you			0
@entity0 were played off the park and lost 2 - 0			1
@entity33 ( right ) was one of four @entity69 players in @entity0 's starting line - up against @entity5 @entity33 was joined by club team - mate @entity65 ( left ) who scored his country 's third on thursday night scrap the commission , end all those @entity98 love - ins : possibly the most significant results on thursday night came in the @entity100 where @entity0 ’s under 20 side beat @entity102 1 - 0 , thanks to a @entity105 own goal			1
ironically @entity107 chairman @entity106 is expected to attempt to mirror some of the grass roots reforms in country ’s such as @entity102 later on friday when his commission unveils its second tranche of reforms that it wishes to see in the game			0
but maybe we have some good youngsters already			0
the most - eagerly anticipated figure of the night was not the number of goals but the attendance – 55,990			2
that made it officially the worst - attended competitive @entity0 match since the new @entity13 was opened , beating the previous lowest , of 57,897 against @entity123 in june 2009 on the night of a tube strike			1
that said , after a dismal @entity128 and in the least - interesting qualification process ever devised , it still represents something of a triumph that so many will still turn out for @entity0			2
@entity0 's attendance against @entity5 was 55,990 - the lowest since the new @entity13 was opened there was a pregnant pause when the @entity135 came to announce the man of the match			1
@entity43 was leading the online vote with 53 per cent but the @entity135 suddenly went quiet mid sentence , presumably suddenly realising the irony of the vote			0
a few minutes later he re-emerged to announce that @entity33 was in fact man of the match , a scandalous suppression of the popular vote			0
perhaps @entity146 could investigate ? @entity147 debuts as @entity0 hit five			2

@entity0 thumped @entity5 5 - 0 on thursday night at @entity13
@entity150 maintained their 100 per cent start in their @entity3 qualifiers
@entity13 attendance of 55,990 was the *stadium* 's lowest since it opened
previous worst was 57,897 against @entity123 in june 2009
four @entity69 players started on thursday for the first time since 1999
