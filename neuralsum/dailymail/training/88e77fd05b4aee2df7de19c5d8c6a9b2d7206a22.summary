by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 7 july 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 7 july 2012 these are the ‘ designer ’ twins - genetically engineered by doctors so their mother could give birth without miscarrying			1
doctors discovered that both @entity7 and her husband @entity8 had abnormal chromosomes which were being passed to their unborn babies , causing them to be miscarried			1
she had tragically lost two sets of twins before doctors made the heartbreaking discovery			1
@entity15 with ' designer ' twins @entity18 and @entity19 who were born last year thanks to a new technique which eliminates faulty chromosomes she underwent a special ‘ designer ’ technique where doctors selected embryos which were free from the abnormal chromosomes that were causing her to miscarry			1
it meant that her twins @entity19 and @entity18 were able to be born safely in march last year			1
mrs @entity7 , 37 , said : ‘ the doctors had told me it was unlikely that i could ever give birth to a baby alive , it was heartbreaking			1
‘ we both had faulty chromosomes that meant that when i fell pregnant , the baby would either miscarry or die at full term , before i could give birth			1
‘ i thought i would never be a mum - but now my twins have been born safely due to this wonderful technique			1
it seems like a miracle			0
the couple , who live in @entity42 , @entity43 , started trying for a family after they got married in 2005			0
after two miscarriages and another two failed @entity47 attempts the couple tried @entity48 where doctors selected embryos which were free from the abnormal chromosomes that were causing her to miscarry mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i thought it would happen straight away			1
i came off the pill and expected to fall pregnant within a few months			0
‘ but nothing happened , so i went to see my gp who told me to be patient and that it can take a while and not to worry			0
but by @entity59 the following year mrs @entity7 still had n’t fallen pregnant so she went for a scan and doctors discovered she had polycystic ovaries			1
she was put on the fertility drug clomid for a further 12 months , but still nothing happened , so the couple were referred for @entity47 treatment			2
@entity7 pictured with husband @entity8 holding @entity19 and @entity18 at the hospital in march 2011 they underwent their first cycle at @entity70 in @entity71 in january 2008 and it was a success			1
doctors put two embryos back into her womb , but then at six weeks she miscarried both the twins			1
mrs @entity7 , a health visitor , said : ‘ we were absolutely devastated			2
we had thought that after the years of trying , we were finally going to be parents			0
when they told me i was pregnant i was overjoyed			0
‘ so to lose both the babies at six weeks was heartbreaking			0
’ the couple underwent a second @entity47 attempt in october 2008 , but that failed			1
a third attempt in march 2009 proved a success and mrs @entity7 once more fell pregnant with twins			1
she said : ‘ i was worried in case anything went wrong , but we were so excited , and were convinced that we could n’t be as unlucky this time			0
’ but again at six weeks she miscarried and lost both babies			0
devastated , she asked the doctors to carry out tests to see why she had lost both sets of twins			2
the tests showed that both @entity92 and her husband @entity8 , 39 , a supplies coordinator for @entity95 , were carriers of abnormal chromosomes - one which caused early miscarriage , and the other which causes the baby to die at full term			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ we were both devastated when we were told the news			2
it meant it was unlikely that i would ever be able to give birth to a baby that was still alive			0
it was heartbreaking to think that it had caused me to lose both sets of twins			0
’ despite being born prematurely at 27 weeks both the twins are happy and healthy and ' coming on in leaps and bounds ' then the doctors told the couple about a technique called @entity48 ( @entity48 ) - a technique that allows doctors to check for genetic disorders in an embryo so that an unaffected embryo can be implanted into the mother ’s womb			1
it means that they could test for the two abnormal chromosomes in the embryos and make sure only ones unaffected would be used			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ we had never heard of the technique before , but it meant that we could have a baby without these abnormalities , so we decided to go ahead			2
it was our only chance at being parents			0
’ the couple underwent their fourth cycle of @entity47 in june 2010 and this time all the embryos were tested , but they were all found to have the genetic fault			1
in september 2010 they had a fifth attempt and this time seven of the 15 embryos were found to be free of the defective chromosomes			2
two were put back into mrs @entity7 ’s womb and were successful			2
she said : ‘ i was so thrilled when i found out i was pregnant , and now this time i knew that the babies had a much better chance of developing normally			0
’ her pregnancy went smoothly until 27 weeks when she went into premature labour			0
she was rushed into the @entity152 in @entity153 and the couple were terrified that they were going to lose the twins			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ after everything we had been through to have the twins , we really thought that they were going to die			1
’ doctors gave her steroid injections to develop the babies lungs whilst they were still in the womb and @entity19 was born first weighing just @entity166 , followed by @entity18 at @entity167			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ they were so fragile and tiny			2
holly had a perforated bowel and @entity18 had a brain haemorrhage			2
‘ but they were both real little fighters and hung on			0
we just had to pray that after everything they had been through they would be alright			0
’ the twins were finally allowed home after three months and are now coming on in leaps and bounds			2
mrs @entity7 added : ‘ they are doing so well now			0
they both have great appetites and they are getting much stronger			0
‘ we feel so lucky to have them , and we are just so grateful for the ‘ designer ’ technique that allowed them to be born			0

@entity7 and husband @entity8 both carried abnormal chromosomes causing her to miscarry .
after four failed @entity47 attempts doctors were finally able to implant two healthy embryos
' designer twins ' @entity19 and @entity18 were born prematurely last year but are now happy and healthy
