when @entity1 , the chief executive of @entity2 , sold @entity3 to @entity4 for £ 16m , he told friends it had ‘ felt like winning the lottery ’			1
@entity3 ’s agent @entity8 had done a number on @entity4 , telling them that he could get the @entity12 forward out of @entity2 on the cheap			1
in their desperation to replace @entity15 , they fell for it			0
in return , @entity8 ’s pockets were lined and @entity4 are even understood to have added the five per cent ( £ 800,000 ) solidarity fee , which is paid to his former clubs , as part of the package			2
@entity3 during the @entity24 match between @entity25 and @entity4 on monday @entity3 has his shot saved by @entity25 goalkeeper @entity27 on monday @entity3 falls to his knees as he shows his dejection at a missed opportunity against @entity25 @entity3 warms up at @entity31 during the second half of the @entity24 clash @entity3 has a drink from a can of @entity36 during his spell on the sideline on monday night it will cost @entity4 a lot of money to get shot of him this month , but fronting up and accepting that they have made a mistake with him is the best thing they can do			1
@entity46 persisted and persisted with @entity47 after they bought him from @entity4 for £ 50m in 2011 , picking up his wages for nearly four years in the hope that it would all come right eventually			2
@entity52 lasted just six months at @entity4 before he returned to his selling club @entity53			2
it happens and players can be moved on			0
finding a buyer for @entity3 in this transfer window , or any other for that matter , will not be easy for @entity4 ’s chief executive @entity60			1
the days when he was man of the moment , winning the prestigious @entity63 award in 2010 after being voted the best young player in @entity65 , are long gone			0
@entity3 has scored twice for @entity4 , once in the @entity66 against @entity67 and another in the @entity68 against @entity69 since his arrival from the @entity71			1
@entity47 , pictured against @entity72 in 2013 , struggled after leaving @entity4 for @entity46 @entity52 ( right ) is unveiled as @entity4 's new signing by manager @entity74 in 2008 @entity3 steps off the team coach as @entity4 arrive at @entity31 on monday night @entity3 ( right ) and @entity25 's @entity76 put their arms around each other on monday @entity4 manager @entity79 ( right ) talks with @entity25 counterpart @entity80 on monday evening , in an @entity24 third - round tie at @entity25 , who are 12th in @entity83 , @entity3 could not get a game ahead of @entity85			1
even after his appearance as a substitute there was a report that he flounced off when he was told to warm down on the pitch at the @entity31 with one of @entity4 ’s fitness coaches			2
everybody has tried and failed with @entity3 : @entity94 ( twice ) , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
when a manager with @entity95 ’s stature can not get through to him , you do have to wonder what @entity79 was thinking when he agreed to sign the forward			0
@entity3 is not about to come good			0
everybody has their own favourite @entity3 story , but the trouble is that none of them reflect well on him			0
@entity3 is snapped by photographers as he walks out onto the pitch for the pre-match warm - up on monday @entity3 listens to assistant manager @entity114 ( right ) as he prepares to come on as a substitute @entity95 has refined his story about @entity3 ’s dismissal against @entity118 in the @entity66 over the years , but remove the poetic licence and the sentiment is clear			1
‘ @entity3 got a yellow card in the 42nd minute ( it was actually the 20th ) , so when i got to the dressing room at half - time i spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to @entity3			2
' i said to him : “ @entity3 , i can not change you , i have no strikers ( he had named two keepers ) on the bench , so do n't touch anybody and play only with the ball			0
if we lose the ball no reaction			0
if someone provokes you , no reaction , if the referee makes a mistake , no reaction			0
” ' the 46th minute – red card ! ' ( he was actually sent off in the 60th )			0
when he was a player at @entity142 , club officials were not even certain that he would turn up at @entity143 to play @entity46 in the @entity144 in 2012 because it coincided with his birthday			0
@entity3 had been out with friends the night before and when he eventually arrived , @entity94 did not even name him on the bench			1
most recently @entity99 , who replaced @entity98 as @entity150 coach after the @entity151 , sent him home early from international duty			0
he told @entity3 he will not be selected again			2
@entity95 talks to @entity3 during @entity155 's @entity154 match against @entity156 in 2009 @entity142 manager @entity94 gestures towards @entity3 during a match in 2012 @entity79 looks towards @entity3 during @entity4 's match against @entity159 last september since his return from the suspension imposed on him by the @entity24 following his offensive re-tweet , his status within the dressing room has shifted markedly			1
@entity79 had always maintained that @entity3 has never caused him a moment ’s trouble since his arrival from @entity2 and consistently claims that the forward is working hard to improve			1
in recent weeks , though , the @entity4 manager has admitted that @entity3 has struggled to adapt to the team ’s ethos of a high - pressing game			1
instead he has played @entity173 in a central role , with some success after a false start in the 3 - 0 defeat against @entity178 at @entity179 just before the turn of the year			0
at the front of house , @entity79 continues to believe in @entity3 and yet the task behind the scenes is to convince the forward that @entity186 is not quite for him			0
if they can make the numbers work , now is the time to let him go .			1

@entity3 was sold by @entity2 to @entity4 for £ *16million*
@entity2 chief executive told friends it had ' felt like winning the lottery '
fronting up and accepting it was a mistake is the best thing for @entity4
finding a buyer for the @entity12 striker will not be easy
@entity95 and @entity94 both tried and failed with @entity3
if @entity4 can make the numbers work , now is the time to let him go
