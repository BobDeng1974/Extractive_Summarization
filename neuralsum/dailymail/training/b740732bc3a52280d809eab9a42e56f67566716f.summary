by @entity0 @entity1 will play through the pain barrier to make @entity5 ’s crucial @entity4 clash with @entity6 in the @entity7 on wednesday night			1
it is believed that @entity1 might have suffered a chipped bone in his foot in the first leg at @entity12 – and not a badly bruised toe as first thought – but he will take strong painkillers to play in @entity5 ’s biggest game of the season			1
@entity5 boss @entity18 hinted that a painkilling injection was a possibility on friday after revealing that his 17 - goal striker would miss the trip to @entity23			0
‘ sometimes you can feel better quite quickly and sometimes you need an injection possibly to play with it if it is bruising			0
‘ you have to make sure there is n’t a hairline fracture or crack in your toe			0
we will have all that checked			0
’ after the @entity23 game , @entity18 revealed that @entity1 was back at @entity58 doing work in the pool in a bid to be fit for wednesday ’s quarter - final in @entity63			1
he added : ‘ we have worked him hard on the bike and in the swimming pool , friday and today ( saturday ) and we will give him every opportunity to be fit			2
’ spot on : @entity1 has been back among the goals in his last few games , including a penalty against @entity72 volley good show : @entity5 team - mates congratulate @entity1 after his wonder goal against @entity77 tread carefully : @entity1 will not want to aggravate the injury ahead of the @entity79 with @entity80 it underlines just how desperate @entity1 is to play against @entity82 , despite seeing a similar move backfire against the @entity63 four years ago			2
he suffered an ankle injury at the @entity7 when @entity5 last met @entity6 in the @entity4 quarter - finals in 2010 , and his determination to play in the second leg – eventually limping off after 55 minutes at @entity12 – was later blamed for a poor showing at the @entity90			0
an omen ? @entity1 injured himself in the 2010 quarter - final against @entity6 before a poor show at the @entity79			1
