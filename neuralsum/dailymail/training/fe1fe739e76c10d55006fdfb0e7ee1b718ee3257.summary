by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 19 march 2013 a legal professor has found himself on the other side of the law after he was arrested and following a bizarre tirade against students			1
@entity7 professor @entity6 was captured on video engaging with students holding a pro-immigration demonstration , pushing them , and pocketing one of the student ’s phones			1
during his six - minute profanity - laced outburst , he chastised the students , saying : ‘ if you want this country back , start a f * * * * * * war			2
get a gun , shoot me first , i ’m right here			0
legal eagle : @entity6 got his j.d. from the @entity48 in 1987 at the beginning of the video , @entity6 can be seen approaching the students and telling them while their efforts are well - intentioned , no real change would come from four or five students making a mock checkpoint			1
‘ start a f * * * * * * war … stop being p * * * * * * ! ’ he shouts to the group of students during the march 14 incident			0
‘ do something ! ‘ to make something happen , you need lots of people in action , and get hurt , ’ he continued , referring to when @entity68 ‘ took over @entity67			0
’ the group @entity70 ( @entity69 ) occupied the prison in @entity72 from 1969 to @entity73 can then be seen removing his leather motorcycle jacket and aggressively challenging a male student			0
‘ what do you want to talk about ? ’ he asks , removing his glasses and throwing them to the sidewalk			0
the young woman recording the incident , @entity79 , says at one point : ‘ this is an aggressive tone			1
i ’m feeling a little threatened right now			0
’ ms @entity79 was pushed out of the way when @entity6 reached for his glasses			2
the faculty member then grabs the woman ’s phone , though several more minutes of audio can be heard with students saying they feel threatened in the emotionally - charged environment			1
as @entity91 reports , @entity6 , 58 , was arrested and charged with two counts of physical intimidation and second - degree theft			2
in your face : @entity6 seemed to be trying to make a point that the protestors needed to make a bigger statement to instigate change ; one of the protestors later called his demonstration ' racist ' he was also given a letter of trespass , which means he is not allowed to enter the campus for at least 18 months			1
university spokesman @entity107 told the paper that the teaching responsibilities of @entity6 , an adjunct professor , have been reassigned to another faculty member			1
ms @entity79 , the group ’s co-founder , told student newspaper the @entity113 that they were prepared for controversy , but not for a ranting professor			2
she also said that while there has been support from the @entity7 faculty and staff , the group has also been accused of provoking the law professor			1
historic : the @entity123 is located in @entity124 and was founded in 1876 @entity6 ’s attorney , @entity125 , told the student paper that not every vantage point of the story has been told			2
‘ even with the ability to record parts of a situation with audio and video , you ’re still going to have huge gaps in the story , ’ he said , adding that there are legal issues under @entity132 state law over concealed recording devices			0
students against @entity144 ’s other co-founder , @entity143 , told the @entity113 : ‘ we never expected anyone to come up to the group and be so blatantly racist			0
’ warning : video contains explicit language			0

@entity151 law professor @entity6 caught on camera going on rant against student protestors
said their actions , while noble , were not going to institute change
but as emotions *escalated* , @entity6 is seen *swearing* at students , pushing a young woman , and pocketing another protestor *'s* phone
