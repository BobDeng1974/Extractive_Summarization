@entity63 star @entity62 comes in second with 22 goals , followed by @entity66 ( 20 ) , @entity67 ( 19 ) and @entity68 ( 16 )			0
to mark @entity3 passing 400 @entity9 goals , we take a look at some of the highlights			1
@entity3 4 @entity43 0 ( 1994 - 95 group stage ) a @entity43 side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter @entity80 's @entity3 ' @entity79 ' at the wrong time			2
@entity82 and @entity83 ran @entity43 's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans , with the @entity88 scoring twice and the @entity63 once before @entity89 completed @entity43 's humiliation			0
@entity83 fires home @entity3 's second goal in their 1994 rout of @entity43 in the @entity94 @entity3 5 @entity47 1 ( 1999 - 2000 quarter - final , second leg ) leading 3 - 1 from the first leg at @entity98 , @entity47 fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return			1
@entity62 's deflected free - kick and @entity103 's goal had erased the deficit by half - time , though @entity106 put @entity47 back in the box seat			0
they were seven minutes from going through when @entity109 made it 3 - 1 and there was still time for @entity62 to miss a penalty			1
@entity47 's defence crumbled in extra-time , another penalty , this time converted by @entity62 , and a fifth from @entity66 carried @entity3 through			2
@entity103 curls the ball home during @entity3 's 5 - 1 win over @entity47 in 2000 @entity3 2 @entity49 1 ( 2006 final in @entity120 ) the @entity9 triumph that signalled the beginning of @entity3 's golden age			1
they needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of @entity49 , who had been reduced to 10 men when @entity128 brought down @entity68 just 18 minutes in			0
the @entity129 sensationally took the lead through @entity132 's thumping header eight minutes before half - time but could n't hold out as @entity68 and @entity134 sunk them late on			0
captain @entity135 lifts the trophy with @entity137 after @entity3 's 2006 win over @entity49 @entity3 4 @entity40 0 ( 2008 - 09 quarter - final , first leg ) @entity142 's star - studded team showed their @entity9 - winning potential with this demolition of @entity40 in which all four goals came before half - time			1
in no mood to hang around , @entity53 opened the scoring after nine minutes and @entity68 added another three minutes later			0
a second from @entity53 and another from @entity150 essentially settled the two - legged contest before half - time			0
@entity150 salutes @entity68 after rounding off @entity3 's 4 - 0 rout of @entity40 in 2009 @entity3 2 @entity43 0 ( 2009 final in @entity154 ) sir @entity156 's team were going for their second @entity9 triumph in a row and had beaten @entity3 in the 2008 semi-finals			1
@entity142 's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th - minute opener from @entity68 and @entity53 's clincher 20 minutes from time			0
it was @entity3 's midfield partnership of @entity167 and @entity168 that ran the game			2
@entity53 ( left ) and @entity168 parade the @entity9 after the 2009 win over @entity43 @entity3 4 @entity49 1 ( 2009 - 10 quarter - final , second leg ) one of @entity53 's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish @entity49 's @entity9 hopes			1
with the last - eight tie locked at 2 - 2 from the first leg , the @entity94 was stunned when @entity180 scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes			2
from then on , it was a one - man show			0
@entity53 had equalised within three minutes and had @entity3 in control with another couple before the break , including a sumptuous lob			2
a fourth late on made it an emphatic win			0
@entity53 scored four times as @entity3 demolished @entity49 in a 2010 quarter - final @entity29 0 @entity3 2 ( 2010 - 11 semi-final , first leg ) this @entity192 semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was @entity53 and @entity3 that kept their cool as tempers frayed			1
real hothead @entity197 was sent off in the 61st minute and boss @entity199 sent to the @entity200 stands shortly afterwards for protesting			0
@entity201 to seize control , turning home @entity205 's cross and then setting off on a 30 - yard run to score the second			0
@entity3 pile on @entity53 after his goal in the @entity200 semi-final back in 2011 @entity3 3 @entity43 1 ( 2011 final at @entity212 ) @entity3 were unquestionably the best team in @entity213 at this time and another final triumph over @entity43 confirmed this			2
at @entity212 , @entity217 gave them the lead in the 27th minute , only for @entity219 to level shortly afterwards			0
but @entity3 were by far the better team , dominating possession , and it came as little surprise when @entity53 fired home at the start of the second half			2
@entity225 made sure 20 minutes from time as @entity3 claimed a third @entity9 in five years			2
@entity142 is thrown into the air by @entity3 after their 2011 final win over @entity43 @entity3 7 @entity50 1 ( 2011 - 12 last 16 , second leg ) @entity53 raised his game to even greater heights , becoming the first player to score five goals in a @entity9 fixture in this seven - goal drubbing of @entity50			1
leading 3 - 1 from the first leg in @entity238 , there was little pressure on @entity3 and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the @entity244 side 's 217			1
many of them found their way to @entity53 , who scored twice before half - time and added another three after			2
@entity53 slots home his fourth goal in @entity3 's 7 - 1 demolition of @entity50 in 2012 @entity250 0 @entity3 2 ( 2013 - 14 last 16 , first leg ) @entity250 desperately wanted to make a statement on the @entity2 stage but @entity3 had other ideas in this clinical away performance			1

@entity53 dusted himself down to convert the penalty and @entity259 delivered a late second after swapping passes with @entity4			0
@entity53 converts from the penalty spot in @entity3 's 2 - 0 win at @entity250 last season 22 goals - @entity45 18 - @entity46 , @entity47 17 - @entity43 , @entity50 , @entity49 16 - @entity266 , @entity267 14 - @entity268 13 - @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity7 10 - @entity271 , @entity272 9 - @entity273 , @entity274 8 - @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 75 - @entity53 22 - @entity62 20 - @entity66 19 - @entity67 16 - @entity68 15 - @entity217 14 - @entity137 11 - @entity278 , @entity167 10 - @entity168 8 - @entity4 , @entity150 , @entity82 , @entity225 7 - @entity103 , @entity279 , own goals			1
