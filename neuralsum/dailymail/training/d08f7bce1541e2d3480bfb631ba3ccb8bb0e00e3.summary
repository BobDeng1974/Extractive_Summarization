an artist has been banned by @entity1 from posting images of her scientific - based work as they were deemed ' overly sexual '			1
@entity4 had created a hand - stitched piece of art depicting the human body with its microbes for an exhibition titled @entity10 : the @entity11 for the @entity12			1
but she was stunned to be told she could not show pictures of her work on her @entity1 page as the social network did not allow ' overly sexual images ' that ' suggest nudity ' and ' show a lot of skin or cleavage			1
' professional artist @entity4 was shocked after she tried to post images of her artwork on @entity1 , only to be told they breached the social network 's guidelines for being ' overly sexual ' @entity4 , 37 , from @entity29 , @entity28 had been commissioned for the project in august last year and started work a month later			1
the mother - of - three attempted to set up an advert on @entity1 to promote her work but this was rejected for breaching its guidelines			1
a message from ' @entity37 ' of the facebook ads team read : ' your ad was rejected because the image does n't follow our ad guidelines			2
ads may not use overly sexual images , suggest nudity , show a lot of skin or cleavage , or focus unnecessarily on specific body parts			1
this is also applicable to the images present on your pages			0
' please make the necessary edits and recreate your posts			0
if it 's an ad created from the create flow , you can edit it in your ads manager			0
' @entity4 , who is a professional artist and has three children @entity61 , 17 , @entity62 , 15 , and @entity63 , 6 , said she was staggered by the response			1
she said : ' needless to say i was shocked by @entity1 's comments and sat looking confused at the screen for some time			2
' then i decided i must make this public , so i shared the offending image via @entity70 and it soon got many , many re-tweets as others obviously agreed at how absurd this was			0
@entity4 had created the hand - stitched piece of art depicting the human body with its microbes for an exhibition titled @entity10 : the @entity11 for the @entity12 ' so what started as a day where @entity1 would not give me any exposure to up my ' likes ' to a round figure of 500 turned out to be the best exposure the work has received so far and i have n't given them a penny			1
' it was merely meant to be a post to promote the page in general			0
i initially got a generic computer response describing it as a sexual , which i thought was quite funny at first			2
it was so ridiculous so i appealed and thought as soon as a human being saw the advert they would allow it go ahead			2
' that was when i got the e-mail from @entity37 from @entity1 ads , who described it as overly sexual			1
' i just find the whole thing bizarre that you see some horrific things on facebook yet something like this can be censored			0
' we have had the last laugh though and my work has now got more publicity than i could ever have imagined			0
' the artwork ' stitching science ' will play a major part in the @entity10 : the @entity11 exhibition at the @entity12 in may			0
a spokesman for the project said : ' invisible you : the @entity11 ... showcases the fascinating world of the beneficial microbes that live in and on our bodies			0
the work is an embroidered textile hanging that represents the microbial communities of the skin and illustrates that the womb does not contain a microbial community			0
' we are pleased that @entity4 's striking , thought - provoking work is due to be part of @entity10 exhibition and we 're glad that it is sparking debate already			1
' @entity1 have yet to comment .			2

@entity4 was stunned to be told she could n't put work on @entity1
professional artist ' hand - stitched work shows human body with microbes
but the social network deemed pictures ' overly sexual ' and banned them
