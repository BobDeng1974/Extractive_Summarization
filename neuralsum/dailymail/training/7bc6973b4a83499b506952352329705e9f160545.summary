by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 09:50 est , 16 march 2014 the @entity3 corridor from @entity4 to @entity5 is renowned as a spectacular winter haven for hundreds of thousands of water birds			1
but this year 's bitterly cold season has made it notable for something else : dead @entity11 say carcasses began piling up by the hundreds in early january after the plunging temperatures started icing over nearly the entire @entity14 , preventing the ducks from getting to the minnows that are their main source of food			1
necropsies on dozens of birds have confirmed the cause : starvation			2
' all have empty stomachs			2
they 're half the weight they should be , ' said @entity29 , a biologist in the state department of @entity33 's @entity32 office who has personally seen 950 dead birds			1
a dead red - breasted merganser duck sits on an examine table at the @entity39 's wildlife health unit on thursday biologist @entity40 examines a dead red - breasted merganser duck at the @entity39 's wildlife health unit on thursday ' this is unprecedented			1
biologists who 've worked here for 35 years have never seen anything like this , ' she said			1
' we 've seen a decline in tens of thousands in our weekly waterfowl counts			1
' it 's a phenomenon that has been seen elsewhere along the @entity14 , with news reports of diving ducks and other waterfowl turning up dead by the hundreds along the southern part of @entity56			1
they 've also been found in @entity58 between @entity59 and @entity60			2
' it 's a hard winter for ducks , like everything else , ' said @entity64 , wildlife director with the @entity65			1
necropsies and toxicity analyses showed many of the @entity70 ducks were subsisting on invasive zebra mussels , which caused the birds to have potentially toxic levels of selenium in their bodies , @entity64 said			1
zebra mussels filter toxins from the water and pass them up the food chain			0
most of the dead ducks seen in the @entity82 are red - breasted mergansers , which breed in northern @entity84 and @entity85 and come south for the winter to the @entity87			1
in most years , there are periods of freezing and thawing , providing enough breaks in the ice for them to dive for minnows			0
but this winter , it 's been so bitterly cold for so long that the ice had pushed across 92.2 percent of the @entity14 ' surface area earlier this month , according to federal monitors , just short of the record 94.7 percent set in 1979			1
biologists say the @entity3 also has ice extending up to 100 yards off shore , creating a shelf where minnows and shiners can hide			0
the @entity3 corridor from @entity4 to @entity5 is renowned as a winter haven for water birds there is evidence some waterfowl gave up and tried to fly farther south but were too weak to do so			1
dead birds have been seen along shorelines , on docks and on the ice , their carcasses feasted upon by gulls and bald eagles			0
two weeks ago , @entity120 said , there were 240,000 water birds in her area 's weekly count			1
last week , there were 43,000			0
it 's unknown how many birds - which also included such species as scaup , canvasbacks and grebes - migrated elsewhere and how many died.at the @entity39 's @entity133 near @entity134 , biologist @entity40 has refrigerators stuffed with bags of red - breasted mergansers sent by wildlife biologists on @entity59 and @entity5			1
the diving ducks are black and white with a rusty speckled breast , orange bill and an iridescent green head with a shaggy crest on the back			2
' the skin is stuck tight to the body wall because there 's no layer of fat underneath , ' @entity40 said , running a scalpel along the breastbone of a dead merganser			2
the gizzard and intestine were empty , except for a few normal parasites			0
' i 've seen a couple with stomachs full of feathers and feathers all the way down through their intestines , ' @entity40 said			2
' they 're desperate for anything to eat			0
' biologist @entity40 examines the ducks who he says died of starvation unlike mallard or black ducks , mergansers wo n't eat bread or other food people may offer			1
they only eat live fish			0
while the bird deaths are a natural event that can be documented but not changed , wildlife rehabilitators are trying to save birds that people find near death in snowbanks and parking lots			2
' we 've had over 160 since the beginning of january , ' said @entity185 , a wildlife technician at the @entity186 in @entity187			1
' we have to tube - feed them a liquid diet three to four times a day until they 're strong enough to eat on their own			0
' the birds , which spend all their time on water , can hardly walk , and often their natural waterproofing is damaged by dirt or road salt so they ca n't swim either			0
' they soak up water like a sponge and sink , ' @entity185 said			0
so the birds rest in a quiet room on net hammocks called loon beds , preening their feathers back to condition			0
when they 're ready , they go into tubs of water stocked with minnows donated by bait shops			0
' a merganser can eat 200 to 250 fish per day , ' @entity185 said			0
' we go through thousands of fish a day			2
' after anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks , the birds are ready for release			0
' once their weight has increased and they 're real spunky , and we have a decent weather day , we take them back out , ' @entity185 said			0
' and we hope they 'll find enough food to bulk up for their flight north in spring			0

' we 've seen a decline in tens of thousands in our weekly waterfowl counts , ' said @entity29 , a biologist
' it 's a hard winter for ducks , like everything else , ' said @entity64 , wildlife director with the @entity65
the @entity14 are usually considered a winter haven for waterfowl
