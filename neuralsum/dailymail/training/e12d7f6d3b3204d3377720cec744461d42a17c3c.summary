the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) , is working to destroy @entity6 's massive chemical weapons stockpile after a sarin gas strike in the suburbs of @entity9 killed more than 1,400 people in august			1
the @entity12 @entity11 have said they are ' delighted ' that @entity13 , the 16 - year - old schoolgirl they tried to kill , missed out on the award after being widely tipped to win			1
he said : ' we are delighted that she did n't get it			0
she did nothing big so it 's good that she did n't get it			0
' this award should be given to the real @entity43 who are struggling for @entity44			0
@entity13 is against @entity44 , she is secular			2
' the 16 - year - old who moved to @entity46 after she was shot in the head by the @entity11 for championing girls ' right to education			1
a petition for @entity13 to be short - listed attracted more than half a million signatures from across the globe			2
on thursday , the teenager was awarded the @entity55 's highest human rights honour , the @entity56 , whose previous recipients have included past @entity34 prize winners the former @entity61 president @entity62 and @entity63 politician @entity59			2
@entity13 has earned plaudits across the world for her bravery and determination since recovering from a failed assassination attempt by the @entity12 @entity11 in october last year in which she was shot in the head as she travelled with classmates on a school bus			1
only because of emergency medical treatment in @entity12 , and an airlift to the @entity74 in @entity46 , did she survive the attack			0
since the age of 11 , @entity13 has campaigned for the right to education for girls in her country - something the @entity11 has strongly opposed			1
despite the attempt on her life , she has continued to champion children 's access to the classroom			0
she now claims that her ambition is to become prime minister after her dreams of winning the @entity34 were quashed			0
elsewhere more furious critics have branded the decision an ' award to @entity92 ' saying the prize is supporting the regime accusing the judges of being premature			1
one @entity97 activist called @entity98 said : ' they are insulting the martyrs , intentional humiliation of the victims			0
this is an award to @entity92 and @entity103			1
' the @entity4 is tasked with upholding the @entity104 which prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons meanwhile human rights workers pointed out that the organisation had been given the award in the one year during its 16 - year existence when chemical weapons had been used on a mass scale			1
@entity114 , director of the @entity116 office of @entity117 , said : ' i would have thought 2013 would have been a year for soul searching at @entity4 , not accolades			2
' in august the world was shocked by images of thousands of pale bodies , many of them children , beamed across the globe following a sarin nerve gas attack in @entity9			0
warheads landed in the suburbs of @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 just before dawn , meaning many of the victims died in their beds			0
since then the @entity6 rebels and government have pointed the finger of blame at one another , while @entity141 and the @entity142 have agreed a peace plan which will see the destruction of president @entity92 's chemical weapons stockpile			1
the @entity4 have been handed the task , which they say could take months to complete			2
it is not the first time in the prize 's history that it has courted controversy			2
in 2009 the committee drew criticism after deciding to give the award to @entity142 president @entity155 as a calling to make sure his @entity157 lived up to the high standards set during his first election campaign			0
since then , much to the ire of activists , @entity162 has remained open , drone strikes in @entity12 have intensified and @entity142 has maintained a military presence in @entity167 .			0
