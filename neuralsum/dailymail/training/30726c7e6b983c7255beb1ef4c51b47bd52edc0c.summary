by @entity0 egg whites could lower blood pressure in the same way as medication , new research has found			1
a key component found in the whites was found to have the same blood pressure lowering properties as @entity10 , a high blood - pressure drug			1
dr @entity12 , who led the research at @entity15 's @entity14 , said : ' our research suggests that there may be another reason to call it ' the incredible , edible egg '			0
a component found eggs whites has been found to have the same blood pressure lowering properties as some medication ' we have evidence from the laboratory that a substance in egg white - it 's a peptide , one of the building blocks of proteins - reduces blood pressure about as much as a low dose of @entity10 , a high - blood - pressure drug			1
' dr @entity12 and his colleagues studied a peptide found in egg white called @entity42			0
this has a powerful ability to inhibit or block the action of @entity46 , a substance produced in the body that raises blood pressure			1
experiments with rats showed @entity42 had no toxic effects and lowered the blood pressure			2
the findings were presented to the @entity55 of the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) in @entity57			0
dr @entity12 said : ' our results support and enhance previous findings on this topic			0
' they were promising enough to move ahead with further research on the effects of the egg white peptide on human health			0
' dr @entity12 said he believed that egg white peptides , either in eggs or as a supplement , could become useful as an adjunct to high - blood - pressure medication			1
the substance in egg white has a powerful ability to inhibit or block the action of @entity46 , a substance produced in the body that raises blood pressure in 2009 , scientists at the @entity80 in @entity81 found that eggs produce proteins that mimic the action of powerful blood pressure - lowering drugs			1
they too found that eggs may lower blood pressure in the same way as @entity46 inhibitors			2
the drugs lower blood pressure by stopping the hormone angiotensin narrowing the body 's blood vessels			2
the researchers found that when eggs come in contact with stomach enzymes , they produce a protein that acts in the same way			0
last month researchers at the @entity103 reported that a high protein breakfast of eggs is the best way to control appetite and stop dieters snacking at night			0
experts at have found that a breakfast rich in protein significantly improves appetite control and reduces unhealthy snacking on high - fat or high - sugar foods in the evening .			2

component in egg whites can lower blood pressure as much as @entity10 , a high blood - pressure drug
has ability to block the action of @entity46 , a substance produced in the body that raises blood pressure
