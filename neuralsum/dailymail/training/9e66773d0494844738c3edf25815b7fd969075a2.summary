for most planning to study in @entity3 , the high cost of accommodation is an unavoidable burden			1
but the @entity6 family have come up with a novel way to get out of paying thousands on student halls for their daughter – by buying her a narrowboat			1
instead of paying for expensive halls in the capital , @entity13 , 18 , will live on the three - bed barge while she studies for her music production degree			1
miss @entity6 , a keen musician , and her parents , @entity21 and @entity22 , spent the summer refurbishing the vessel , to include glamorous black and white decoration and furnishings			1
to buy the boat and carry out the renovation cost the family £ 37,000 – so around the same it would cost to pay for student halls for three years			1
but @entity45 and mrs @entity6 plan to sell the boat when their daughter graduates and expect it to fetch at least £ 40,000 – therefore making a profit			1
miss @entity6 , who hopes to be at their destination , @entity53 , within ten days , before the start of term on september 29 , said : ‘ it ’s so exciting			2
the boat ’s been done up so nicely with ashwood interior			2
' it ’s such a luxury and glam place to be and something to be proud of			0
’ she has her own room with double bed , a dining room with a table turning into another double bed and a lounge with a large sofa bed			0
the kitchen boasts all mod cons including cooker , fridge , microwave and washing machine and the trendy bathroom with black sparkly floor and white walls features a corner power shower there is also a 32 - inch flat screen in the lounge , @entity85 ' pillows and an internet hotspot for her laptop the kitchen boasts all mod cons including cooker , fridge , microwave and washing machine and the trendy bathroom with black sparkly floor and white walls features a corner power shower			0

miss @entity6 may even earn extra cash by looking for a house - mate to share the boat with			1
@entity104 , 52 , and his wife , @entity22 , a beautician , pictured above with their daughter , bought the boat from a vicar who never sailed it the student accommodation suggested by the @entity36 in @entity29 costs £ 1,000 a month - so around £ 36,000 for her three - year degree this would cover the mooring costs , which are expected to be an additional £ 5,000 to £ 6,000 a year			1
speaking yesterday from her new floating home , as she travelled through @entity116 , she said the idea was her father ’s			2
‘ he mentioned it to me but i was a little bit unsure at first , then i warmed to it			0
i ’ll probably be the envy of all the other students ! ’ she said			0
mr @entity37 , 52 , a design consultant and his wife , @entity22 , a beautician bought the boat from a vicar who never sailed it			1
home alone : but just for now - the student says she may look for a house - mate to share her luxurious boat with once they arrive in @entity3 , miss @entity6 's parents will stay with her until they find a mooring spot in a marina , before returning home miss @entity6 said : ‘ it ’s called @entity32 , quite a fitting name and it ’s staying			1
it ’s bad luck to change name until a boat ’s been taken out of the water and this one has n’t			0
’ once they arrive in @entity3 , miss @entity6 ’s parents will stay with her until they find a mooring spot in a marina , before returning home			1
she has been living in @entity151 for the past week to get used to her new home			0
‘ i was most worried about being in the dark , but as soon as i was here , i felt safe			0
i feel like it is my home , ’ she said			0
all aboard : @entity13 is currently navigating her way down south with her parents , @entity21 and @entity22 mr @entity37 , who owns a design consultancy , said the trip down to @entity3 is the family 's summer holiday this year mr @entity37 said his friend used to live on a narrowboat and it struck him as a nice place for @entity13 to live			1
‘ i thought it would be a suitable alternative			1
@entity13 has the right character to do this , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity170 and my wife , @entity22 , have been working on it and we have been taken in by the boating scene			0
it seemed a better environment for @entity13 to live in , instead of a basement bedsit			2
‘ i would be more worried about @entity13 in a bedsit in a dodgy area of @entity3 on her own than living in a lovely marina			2
‘ it might be a bit more unusual , but it makes sense to me			0
’ mr @entity37 , who owns a design consultancy , added that the trip down to @entity3 is their summer holiday this year			2
‘ it has turned in to an adventure			0
i have stuck a couple of @entity194 on the front of the boat for good luck			0
