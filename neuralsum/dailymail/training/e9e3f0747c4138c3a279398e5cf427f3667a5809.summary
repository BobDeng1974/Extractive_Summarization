half of all jobs at the @entity2 are only open to @entity4 insiders , according to newly uncovered official figures			1
thousands of vacancies at the state - funded broadcaster are never advertised publicly , meaning that only people who already work at the @entity2 are able to apply for them			1
bosses say the policy is necessary to avoid having to make too many staff redundant during a string of re-organisations - but recruitment experts warn that they could be ' restricting the talent base ' by failing to hire workers from outside			2
now figures obtained by @entity30 show that across the corporation as a whole , half of all job vacancies are advertised only on an internal @entity2 forum - or not at all			1
between january 2013 and november 2014 , there were 6,766 vacancies at the @entity2 , of which only 3,498 - or 51.7 per cent - were advertised externally			1
the remaining 3,268 jobs were only advertised within the @entity2 , according to the data which were provided by @entity4 following a @entity41 request			1
the @entity2 hires outsourcing giant @entity42 to run its recruitment procedures , with jobs advertised via the publicly accessible @entity46 website as well as other media outlets such as local and national newspapers			2
however , the site has an additional section which can be accessed only by users with an internal @entity2 log - in username and password , and contains many more job vacancies than the external sections			1
row : director general @entity56 has been at the centre of controversy over the hiring of senior executives at the @entity2 most jobs are initially advertised only in the internal section of the website , then advertised publicly if there is no suitable internal candidate , according to a @entity2 spokesman			1
@entity67 says it has to prioritise insiders for jobs because of the hundreds of posts which have been eliminated over the past few years as a result of the licence fee being frozen by the government since 2010			0
a spokesman told @entity30 : ' as part of our drive to save Â£ 1.5billion the @entity2 is restructuring and cutting the number of posts we have - so when we do need to recruit priority consideration is given to internal candidates in order to save on redundancy costs			2
' a union source suggested that this was nothing more than ' good hr practice ' - but an employment lawyer warned that closing off job opportunities could leave the @entity2 liable to discrimination claims if it can not prove that it has encouraged applications from all sectors of society			1
' the biggest risk by not advertising externally is restricting the talent base , ' said @entity95 , a partner at @entity97 - based law firm shakespeares			0
' you run the risk that you 're actually restricting your workforce - so you could risk a claim [ for discrimination ]			0
' public authorities have a greater commitment to equality			0
they would generally offer the jobs externally as well as internally			0
' however , mr @entity95 also said that organisations ' have a duty to avoid redundancy ' , adding that employers are less likely to face a claim from a laid - off worker if they can show that they have made a reasonable attempt to rehire him or her in a different job			0
official guidelines from the @entity120 state that employers should consider advertising vacancies publicly in order to attract a diverse range of applicants			0
guidance based on the @entity127 reads : ' if an employer does n't advertise at all or advertises in a way that wo n't reach people with a particular protected characteristic , this might in some situations lead to indirect discrimination , unless the employer can objectively justify their approach			0
' this is because not advertising or only advertising in a very limited way may stop people with a particular protected characteristic finding out about a job , which could count as worse treatment			0
' headquarters : the @entity2 - based at @entity146 , pictured - says its policy is down to the need to avoid redundancies while re-structuring the organisation in recent months comedian @entity151 has led a campaign to increase diversity in the @entity2 and criticised managers for not giving enough ethnic minority broadcasters a chance to display their talents			1
in general , opportunities for private sector workers to move into the public sector are currently extremely rare - separately to the @entity2 's hiring policy , the @entity158 has imposed a ' freeze on external recruitment ' which means that nearly all job vacancies are filled by candidates who are already civil servants			1
the @entity2 came under fire last year over the hiring of senior executives , many of whom apparently landed their high - profile jobs without having to apply for them			2
director general @entity56 , who was hired in the aftermath of the @entity174 scandal , appointed a number of managers , including his former colleague @entity177 and ex-cabinet minister @entity178 , to positions which had not been publicly advertised			0
and in november , the @entity2 revealed to @entity180 that several senior journalists had been hired to fill jobs which were not even advertised within @entity4			2
the organisation refuses to discuss the hiring of most of its best - known faces - such as economics editor @entity186 and @entity188 presenter @entity187 - because they fall under the banner of ' talent ' and are therefore exempt from freedom of information laws .			0

only *52* *%* of @entity2 job vacancies are advertised externally , new figures show
the rest are advertised on an internal jobs website meaning that only current @entity2 employees can apply
experts warn the @entity4 could be liable to claims of discrimination
but the @entity2 says it has to advertise jobs internally to avoid redundancies
