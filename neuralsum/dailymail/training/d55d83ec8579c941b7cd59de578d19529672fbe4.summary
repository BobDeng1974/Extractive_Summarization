last week his brother and another friend @entity41 , also from @entity22 , appeared in a shocking recruitment video aimed at luring jihadists to @entity7 and @entity44			1
a school friend toldthe @entity46 : ' @entity14 was a senior member			1
if you know of the group you would not go there at night â€” if they saw you they would probably start on you			2
they would often be in fights , sometimes caused by race			2
' they would call some of the white kids " pastey boys "			1
' one @entity22 boy , who was attacked by members of the gang , said in an online post : ' they 've got ages from 10 - 16 and most of them carry knives			1
. a few with guns			0
i was pinned down at 11 years of age in a lane and i was cut with a bottle up my arm and that was because they had beef with my cuzun ( sic ) and they could n't get him '			0
in february @entity14 fled @entity2 to fight in @entity7 after telling his parents he was staying at his friend 's house ahead of a maths exam at his school			1
@entity22 link : @entity41 and @entity14 's brother @entity86 appear in this @entity18 recruitment video encouraging others to fight jihad school days : third @entity2 jihadist @entity41 having fun with friends in @entity22 before he fled to fight but police then arrived at his home the following night after it emerged he had gained a second passport by lying about his age and was in @entity97 and about to sail to @entity7			1
the father of two brothers fighting with @entity18 in @entity7 said today young @entity10 men are being radicalised at ' pop - up ' meetings in @entity22 - including at a suburban leisure centre			1
distraught father @entity104 , 57 , said extremists are leafleting @entity10 communities in the @entity108 capital encouraging young men to join the jihad in @entity7 and @entity44			1
he said the recruitment meetings are never held in the same venue twice to avoid being infiltrated by anti-terrorist police			0
but mr @entity86 told how one of the meetings was held in the @entity116 in the @entity21 area of @entity22 - after being rented out by the @entity119 - run council			1
father - of - four mr @entity86 said : ' i believe my two sons went to one of these meetings and now they are with the @entity18 people in @entity7			1
' they never hold these meetings in the same place twice - they know what they are doing			0
' i know they had a meeting at @entity116 , there have been others in restaurants and in private homes			0
' they just book a room at these places saying it is for a private function			0
it is like one of these pop - up restaurants			0
they are there for a few hours and then they move on			0
' mr @entity86 added : ' some of the venues have been restaurants and businesses run by people sympathetic to the extremists			0
' his brother @entity17 was a star medical student who secretly travelled to @entity7 from his family home in @entity22 despite being offered the opportunity to study medicine by four universities			1
his family have not seen him since november 2013			0
furious father @entity104 , 57 , said if his sons ever return to the @entity2 , he would like to see them jailed			2
he added that his sons have ' betrayed his family and betrayed @entity2 ' - before insisting he had already binned family pictures of his boys because ' you do n't keep the devil in your house			2
' mr @entity86 , who moved to the @entity2 from @entity163 in the seventies and earned a living repairing televisions , collapsed and was rushed to hospital when he heard his second son had also gone to fight			2
there are concerns about radicalisation problems in @entity22 after three young men from the area rushed to fight in @entity7			1
former @entity22 councillor @entity174 told @entity176 's today programme this morning he did not believe young men in the city were being radicalised in mosques but instead some had been influenced by ' internet clerics			2
' sheikh @entity181 , imam of the @entity182 , told @entity183 that @entity17 and @entity14 had been ' normal teenagers ' before they went through a ' very strange period ' when they started expressing ' certain views '			1
' the brothers were normal teenagers , very well - spoken , very sincere , liked watching movies , did a lot of school , normal teenagers , ' he said			0
pictured : @entity17 's room in the family home in @entity22 where the brothers plotted how to take part in a holy war thousands of miles away in @entity7 in shock : @entity17 and @entity197 's parents and youngest brother walk through their @entity22 estate			1
their father has said they should be arrested and jailed if they return to the @entity2 ' however , they went through a very strange period when they said they were becoming quite serious in their faith and then began to start to expressing certain views that were quite political , particularly the older brother			1
concerns : the imam of the local mosque said the boys were ' normal teenagers ' but both , especially @entity17 ( pictured ) began to start to expressing certain views that were quite political ' neither of them in the past year and a half to two years frequented this mosque or attended any of the sermons or any of my classes that i have been giving for the past three and a half years			1
' he said he regretted the publicity that the video had attracted			0
' i guarantee that many young people who are very susceptible to this type of message will have watched that video and maybe have been encouraged to now go and follow in the footsteps of @entity17 and his brother , which is a real problem , the fact that a platform has been given to this video , that really should n't have been given			1
' he added that @entity41 's mother had approached him , ' crying her eyes out ' , after he had given a lecture on extremism			0
' @entity41 's mother approached me several months ago			0
i did a lecture on extremism , on @entity243 , several months ago , in a particular mosque and she came up to me afterwards , she was crying her eyes out , she said ' what can i have done , what can i do ? ' i tried to console her			0
this happened several months ago			0
' he said he had spoken out , warning young people not to do the same			0
' i expressed how young people should not be going			0
we have done this already , we have done the work , we have spoken out several months ago , way before the media even got a whiff of what was going on , ' he said			0
a former director of @entity258 has warned intelligence services faced an ' impossible ' task of tracking the hundreds of @entity2 who have returned to @entity2 after fighting in @entity7			1
@entity262 , a former head of counter-terrorism at @entity258 , estimated ' possibly up to 300 people have come back to the @entity2 ' already			2
his comments came after it emerged that around 500 @entity2 had travelled to @entity7 and @entity44 - a higher estimate than the 400 claimed by foreign secretary @entity268			2
@entity262 , a former director of @entity258 , has warned intelligence services faced an ' impossible ' task of tracking the hundreds of @entity2 who have returned to @entity2 after fighting in @entity7 mr @entity262 told the @entity176 : ' clearly they 'll have to prioritise and they 'll have to choose those that they think are likely to pose the greatest risk			1
' beyond that i think they 'll have to rely very much on members of the community and other people expressing their concern and worry about the behaviour of perhaps their returned friend or family member			2
' mr @entity262 said that while recruiting networks across @entity287 suggested of greater radicalisation than people just going on their own , it did not necessarily indicate that people would progress from fighting in @entity7 to being a terrorist at home			2
police across the @entity2 have made 65 @entity7 - related arrests over the last 18 months , including 40 in the first three months of this year alone			2
sir @entity295 , who leads on the @entity297 counter-terrorism strategy for the @entity298 , said ' huge amounts of material ' was being taken down from the internet every week as part of the effort to stop people being radicalised			0
but others say the figures are much higher			0
@entity308 mp @entity307 told @entity309 : ' i imagine 1,500 certainly would be the lower end			2
if you look across the whole of the country , there 's been a number of people going across			0
' originally you had the @entity2 @entity7 settled here who wanted to go back and play a part , then you had the @entity323 community , then almost two years ago you had the young @entity2 @entity10 community going across - so if you add all that up you 've got serious figures that we need to look at			1
' those will come back - certainly more than we are saying at the moment - and we do need to look at that			0
' so we need to look at exactly how this is happening , what our border controls are like and we really need to bolster those border controls in order to ensure that we see the people coming through and deal with them			0
