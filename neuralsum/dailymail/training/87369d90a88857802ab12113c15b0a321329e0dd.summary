researchers claim to have found fresh physical evidence the @entity2 was created when a body the size of @entity5 smashed into the early @entity6 in a cataclysmic collision			1
analysis of lunar rocks brought back by the @entity11 missions shows they have heavier forms of zinc - a telltale sign of the impact billions of years ago			1
without the @entity2 there may have been no life on @entity6 because it once orbited much closer to us than it does now causing massive tides to ebb and flow every few hours			2
these tides caused dramatic fluctuations in salinity around coastlines which are believed to have driven the evolution of primitive dna - like biomolecules			2
planetary scientist dr @entity36 says the zinc enrichment probably arose because heavier atoms condensed out of the cloud of vaporized rock quicker than lighter onces			2
his researchers analysed 20 samples of @entity2 rocks including ones from the @entity46 , 12 , 15 and 17 missions - all of which went to different locations - and one lunar meteorite			1
dr @entity36 , of @entity53 in @entity54 , said : ' what we wanted were the basalts because they ’re the ones that came from inside the @entity2 and would be more representative of the @entity2 ’s composition			0
' according to the @entity62 , proposed in its modern form at a conference in 1975 , @entity6 's moon was created in a apocalyptic collision between a planetary body called @entity62 ( in @entity70 mythology the mother of the @entity68 ) and the early @entity6			1
this collision was so powerful it is hard for mere mortals to imagine , but the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs is thought to have been the size of @entity77 , whereas @entity62 is thought to have been the size of the planet @entity5			0
the smashup released so much energy it melted and vaporized @entity62 and much of the proto - @entity6 's mantle			0
the @entity2 then condensed out of the cloud of rock vapor , some of which also re-accreted to the @entity6			0
scientists have been looking for this kind of sorting by mass - called isotopic fractionation - since the @entity11 missions first brought @entity2 rocks to @entity6 in the 1970s			1
compared to terrestrial or @entity5 rocks the lunar rocks have much lower concentrations of zinc but are enriched in the heavy isotopes of zinc			1
' the magnitude of the fractionation we measured in lunar rocks is 10 times larger than what we see in terrestrial and @entity5 rocks , ' @entity36 says , ' so it 's an important difference			1
' @entity6 and @entity5 have isotopic compositions like those of chondritic meteorites , which are thought to represent the original composition of the cloud of gas and dust from which the solar system formed			1
the most likely large - scale event is wholesale melting during the formation of the @entity2			0
the zinc isotopic data therefore supports the theory a giant impact gave rise to the @entity118			1
dr @entity36 , whose study is published in @entity121 , said : ' the work also has implications for the origin of the @entity6 because the origin of the @entity2 was a big part of the origin of the @entity6			0
' without the stabilising influence of the @entity2 the @entity6 would probably be a very different sort of place			0
scientists think the @entity6 would spin more rapidly , days would be shorter , weather more violent and climate more chaotic and extreme			2
in fact it might have been such a harsh world it would have been unfit for the evolution of humans			0
the interior of one of the moon rocks analysed as part of the study asked how he felt when he saw the first results , @entity36 says , ' when you find something that is new and that has important ramifications , you want to be sure you have n't gotten anything wrong			1
' i half expected results like those previously obtained for moderately volatile elements , so when we got something so different , we reproduced everything from scratch to make sure there were no mistakes because some of the procedures in the lab could conceivably fractionate the isotopes			0
' the data , published in the oct. 18 , 2012 , issue of @entity121 , provide the first physical evidence for wholesale vaporization event since the discovery of volatile depletion in @entity2 rocks , @entity36 says			1
a new theory put forward by @entity172 scientists in a seperate study suggests the @entity2 was once part of the @entity6 that spun off after a giant collision with another body			2
in a paper published on wednesday in the journal @entity181 , @entity177 and @entity178 said their theory would explain why the @entity6 and @entity2 have similar composition and chemistry			0
the @entity6 was spinning much faster at the time the @entity2 was formed , and a day lasted only two to three hours , they said			2
with the @entity6 spinning so quickly , a giant impact could have launched enough of the @entity6 's material to form a moon , the scientists said			1
according to the new theory , the @entity6 later reached its current rate of spinning through gravitational interaction between its orbit around the @entity195 and the @entity2 's orbit around @entity6			0
the scientists noted that their proposition differed from the current leading theory , which holds that the @entity2 was created from material from a giant body that struck the @entity6			2
@entity201 is a professor of earth and planetary sciences at @entity172 , and @entity178 , an astronomer and an investigator at the @entity206 , which supports research into the search for extraterrestrial life			0
the latter was conducting post-doctoral research at @entity172 .			0
