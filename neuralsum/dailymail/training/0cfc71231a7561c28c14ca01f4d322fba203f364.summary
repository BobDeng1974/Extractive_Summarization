by @entity1 reporter if several @entity4 media outlets are to be believed , there 's a new trend in @entity6 where teens have started to take heads of cabbage on walks on leashes to combat loneliness and depression			1
' i have more interest for my cabbage than i do my parents			0
i feel it understands me , ' the @entity18 quoted a @entity6 teen as saying in an article published earlier this month			2
' i feel i can transfer my negative thoughts about myself to the cabbage , go for a walk with it and come home feeling better about myself , ' the website quotes another @entity6 teen as saying			2
' trend ' : @entity4 news outlets like the @entity18 erroneously reported a ' trend ' involving @entity6 teens walking cabbage to cope with loneliness ' art ' : the ' cabbage patch kids , ' as they 've been called , actually are participating in a piece of ' performance art ' by a @entity6 ' artist ' the only problem , however , is that it is n't true - not all of it , anyway			1
indeed , @entity6 teens have been spotted walking around the streets of @entity43 lugging heads of cabbage behind them on leashes			1
but it is n't new , it is n't a ' trend , ' and it has nothing to do with combating loneliness			0
rather , it 's part of a performance art piece by @entity6 artist @entity56 that was unveiled at the @entity43 music festival - and @entity56 has been walking produce on leashes for more than a decade			1
the @entity60 tracked down @entity61 after the ' trend ' story about the ' cabbage patch kids ' walking salads around @entity43 was so badly bungled by @entity4 news outlets			1
@entity56 explains he has been working with produce , as well as other inanimate objects , since 2000			2
performance : the latest installment of the ' performance art ' was unveiled at the @entity71 in @entity43 ' originally , i intended for walking the cabbage to have no meaning , ' @entity56 said			1
' i was only trying to encourage freedom , and to get people to question their daily activities			0
there ’s a knot in everyone ’s head , and i want to untie that knot			0
a lot of people come up to me asking what i ’m trying to accomplish , but when i ’m walking my cabbage , i do n’t want to talk			0
just doing what i ’m doing is enough			0
' @entity61 has created an entire photo series called ' walking the @entity89 ' that includes photos of him and his cabbages all over the world			0
the website culturetrip.com describes @entity61 's project as such : ' from @entity96 to @entity97 , from @entity98 to @entity99 , @entity56 and his cabbage have traveled the world			2
' @entity56 : ' @entity61 has been walking produce and other inanimate objects around the world since 2000 upon discovering that cabbage walking was neither new , nor a ' trend , ' the @entity18 ran a correction to its original story written by blogger @entity109			1
' it ’s unclear whether the teens really saw some therapeutic benefit to the cabbage walking , or they were just messing with reporters , ' the correction states .			0

*western* media outlets reported that @entity43 's ' cabbage patch kids ' were part of a new trend
the @entity18 reported that @entity6 teens were walking heads of cabbage on a leash to combat loneliness
in reality , though , it was part of a ' performance art ' piece by @entity6 ' artist ' @entity56 , and is not the *widespread* ' trend ' news outlets reported it to be
@entity56 has been walking produce on a leash since 2000
