by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 20:45 est , 11 december 2013 @entity3 : 20:50 est , 11 december 2013 an investigation has been launched into whether moves to make diesel cleaner could be putting millions of drivers at risk of breakdowns in potentially dangerous situations			1
fuel suppliers have been implementing @entity13 regulations to mix conventional diesel with environmentally - friendly biofuels , made from crops including corn , sugarcane and rapeseed			1
but there has been a surge in sudden breakdowns of diesel cars in cold weather since the greener fuel was introduced , and the concentration of biofuel in the mixture increased			1
new cleaner diesel could be putting drivers at risk of breakdowns according to the @entity32 the @entity32 revealed it attended 600 call - outs last month from motorists whose fuel filters have become clogged by a build - up of thick gel in the engine , compared with 280 incidents in november 2012			1
the organisation said the problem disappeared last summer when weather was warmer			0
drivers only become aware of the issue when their car suffers a sudden loss of power – and mechanics found that on affected cars the fuel filter has been clogged by the fuel ‘ waxing ’ – a similar effect to when olive oil clouds in a bottle			1
one affected motorist , @entity55 , from @entity56 , said the engine of his @entity58 cut out suddenly while overtaking on a dual carriageway			0
he said : ‘ i put my foot on the accelerator and it suddenly cut out			0
it cost me £ 160 to fix			0
’ @entity63 has 9.4 million diesel vehicles which could be affected			2
fuel suppliers have to add biofuel to road fuels under the @entity13 ’s @entity68			2
the @entity32 has warned that drivers who use cleaner diesel could be in danger of winter breakdowns the investigation into whether blended diesel is being carried out by industry bodies the @entity63 @entity76 , the @entity77 , and the @entity78 , working with the @entity79			1
@entity80 , technical director of the @entity32 , said biofuel content in diesel was being probed because it was the newest element to be added to diesel – and that the problem had not occurred before			1
he said : ‘ it 's clear that we still do n't fully understand all aspects of the underlying cause			0
’ the @entity89 said transport minister @entity90 had asked the industry to resolve the issue as quickly as possible			0
according to @entity32 data , breakdowns due to clogged fuel filters on diesel vehicles have been more prevalent in eastern parts of @entity98 and @entity99 , which bore the brunt of cold weather in recent weeks , but other parts of the country have also been affected			1
the @entity63 @entity76 , which represents oil refining and marketing companies , said it was aware of the problems and that the investigation would work to reveal the cause			2
meanwhile , the @entity110 is urging the @entity111 to reopen an investigation into ‘ loss - leading ’ supermarket fuel promotions which it believes are driving independent garages to the wall			0
supermarkets have been offering promotions such as 10 pence off a litre of fuel for motorists spending £ 50 or £ 60 on their groceries – bringing petrol and diesel below cost price			2
@entity126 , head of the @entity127 , said : ‘ such practices are causing the continuing trend of independent forecourt closures			0
’ in @entity134 , two of the country ’s biggest supermarkets have agreed to end heaving promotions in a deal brokered by the @entity137 .			0
