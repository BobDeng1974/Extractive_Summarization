if he navigates the next stretch of uncharted territory as adroitly as he did the treacherous links of @entity4 , @entity0 will take some stopping			1
until sunday , the @entity6 had never won back - to - back tournaments			1
after following up his win at @entity10 ’ very own @entity11 by winning the @entity12 , his sights are now set on a remarkable treble			1
he heads to @entity15 for @entity16 in the best form of his life , his links skills honed to near - perfection during a closing 65			1
i ’ve never won two in a row and i ’ve certainly never won three in a row			2
so this is uncharted territory			0
‘ but i do n’t feel like these two wins have taken too much out of me			0
i have n’t taken my eye off the ball			0
i wo n’t be celebrating too much			0
in the past , i feel like i ’ve enjoyed my wins a little too much			0
so i will try to stay level - headed			2
by tomorrow my mind will be back on the game			0
’ @entity30 compared the pressure on him to his breakthrough season of 2010 , when he headed to @entity16 on the back of two @entity50 @entity49 wins , but he said : ‘ i ’ve been playing well for four or five years now and i ’m a lot more comfortable with the expectations			1
i trust my game more			0
’ he left his playing partner , @entity33 ’s @entity54 , open - mouthed in wonder at his skills			2
‘ obviously i did n’t want to be on the end of it , ’ said the 33 - year - old			1
‘ but it was a joy to watch			0
’ in defence : @entity62 shot a final round 65 on the links at @entity4 fizzled out : @entity64 finished behind @entity62 after previously breaking the course record despite putting the local hero to the sword , @entity30 was roared on by the local galleries , many of whom hope to be cheering him on in @entity73 colours at @entity74 later this year			1
‘ the next time i will be in @entity33 will be for the @entity79 , ’ he told them in his victory speech			2
‘ so hopefully you will be loud and proud			0
’ @entity30 went into sunday tied with @entity54 at 10 under par. but he edged ahead with birdies on the second and third — and never looked back at the mayhem unfolding beneath him			1
there were things happening on every corner of the course under the grey drizzle			0
@entity90 made an unlikely charge , then @entity92 followed by getting within touching distance of double digits under par. both came up short but , along with young @entity97 , claimed places in @entity16 as consolation			1
just when you thought it was safe , defending champion @entity62 put in a phenomenal push that just petered out towards the end			1
above the melee , though , @entity30 looked like he was in a world of his own , reaching the turn in 31 strokes			1
no - one was able to match his pace and , at the end of four days of extremes , he stood two shots clear of @entity90			2
now can he pull off a third straight win ? some of those who competed here will fancy themselves to stop @entity30 , with defending @entity12 champion @entity62 believing he ’s played himself into form			1
after shooting 65 , the @entity50 insisted he ’d be relaxed going to @entity15			2
true @entity120 : @entity6 's @entity97 was one of three players to claim a qualifying place for @entity16 ‘ there is a fraction of the pressure i felt before at @entity126 , ’ he said			1
‘ because , once you ’ve already won it , once you ’ve held the @entity129 and have one , it just feels different			2
you do n’t feel like you have to fight it and have to force it			0
’ @entity64 finished with a 67 , his third round under par this week — the odd one out being friday ’s horrific 78			1
‘ i see enough good signs in my game to give me confidence for next week , ’ he insisted			0
‘ i am in good form			0
i had three good rounds here			0
if i could just string a fourth round in there it would be great and , going into next week , that is what i am going to try and do — play four solid rounds of golf and see where that leaves me			0
’ @entity147 - day 3 highlights			2

@entity0 won the @entity12
first time @entity6 has won consecutive titles in his career
@entity30 will head to @entity16 in @entity15 as one of the favourites
@entity62 could not retain the title he won last year
