by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:48 est , 23 september 2012 updated : 08:50 est , 23 september 2012 @entity4 ’s opposition to a plastic bag tax is the last remaining barrier to the introduction of a levy in @entity9 , @entity2 claimed today as they voted to bolster their ‘ weaponry ’ against the @entity12 ’s resistance			1
the @entity2 conference backed a motion demanding a levy on all single - use plastic bags , with proceeds to go to community food initiatives			1
senior party figures said the move was designed to counter what they said was a @entity12 ‘ log jam ’ which had repeatedly blocked the idea of charging for bags to encourage people to curb their use			2
the @entity2 claim the @entity12 is the last stumbling block to securing a levy on plastic bags to cut pollution a poll by the @entity33 coalition of campaign groups last week found more than half people – 56 per cent – supported the idea of a small charge for disposable bags			1
official figures show around 350million more bags were given out by retailers over last year , despite @entity42 demanding ‘ significant falls ’			1
@entity2 say @entity44 , the former @entity45 environment secretary , was supportive of the idea of a levy but came up against @entity12 resistance , something the @entity12 denies			1
after mr @entity4 proposed taxes on pasty and caravans - sparking a public outcry and leading to embarrassing u-turns - it was claimed the @entity12 was reluctant to appear to be adding to the day - to - day costs of low income families			2
but @entity58 , the @entity2 policy spokesman on the environment , today told @entity1 he hoped the adoption of a new party policy on the issue would place the issue back on the agenda			1
@entity2 mp @entity58 said the new party policy ensured campaigners had the ' most effective weaponry ' in taking on the @entity12 's resistance ‘ we have seen some indications of support coming out of @entity72 , ’ he said			1
‘ it has always been over-ruled by the @entity12			0
we have only one remaining log jam and we need to keep firing the most effective weaponry at it and making it quite clear that this issue will not go away			0
’ however @entity12 insiders were said to be ‘ bemused ’ by the suggestion that mr @entity4 was blocking the policy			1
‘ all ideas are on the table , ’ said a source			2
‘ and the @entity2 know that			2
’ in @entity85 shoppers are charged 5p for carrier bags with the money going to good causes			0
the @entity89 has had a levy since 2002 , and has seen significant drops in plastic bag use			2
last year mr @entity42 said the level of bag use was ‘ unacceptable ’ and government sources suggested there had to be a reduction of five per cent			1
instead the number rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion for 2011 - 12			1
mr @entity58 added : ‘ we need to bear down on excessive landfill			2
it is a cause of very significant pollution not just in the waste stream but around the countryside			0
‘ it is quite unnecessary			0
there are just so many alternatives to having a ready supply of free plastic bags			0
‘ it is a very simple , straight forward hit , ’ the mp for @entity111 told @entity1			0
@entity2 activist @entity112 told the conference that she had changed her mind about the need for a levy after visiting @entity89 where there were not bags in hedgerows the @entity2 are pushing for a levy of between 5p and 10p per bag			1
‘ it has got to be sufficient to make people think hard before going out shopping , planning in advance , and taking reusable bags with them where they can			0
‘ we do n’t want to penalise people who find themselves in a situation where they have no alternative but we do need to change behaviour			0
‘ behaviour is changing , but it seems to be that the political will is n’t there to tip things in the right direction			0
’ the @entity2 motion was backed by delegates at the party conference in @entity138 after being urged to do so by @entity112 , a former election candidate who acted as a spokesman for or @entity140 and @entity142 's @entity141			1
ms @entity112 said she used to be against the party ’s policy on plastic bags but had changed her mind after visiting @entity89			2
‘ you do n’t see plastic bags floating around in hedgerows because of course there is a plastic bag tax			0
' it has changed people ’s behaviour and that to me is a sign of a very good policy			0
it is a policy which will effect change			0

@entity2 adopt new policy demanding a charge of up to 10p to fund community food projects
party environment spokesman @entity58 says resistance from @entity4 is the final *hurdle*
*treasury* insiders insist all options are still on the table
bag use rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion in 2011 - 12 despite @entity42 demanding reductions
