by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 08:25 est , 19 february 2013 solicitor @entity1 has been jailed for ten years for his involvment in @entity4 's biggest sham marriage racket which let up to 2,000 illegal immigrants stay in the country a lawyer and three accomplices were jailed yesterday for arranging 2,000 sham marriages that earnt them £ 20million			1
@entity1 and his gang flew women into @entity4 from @entity14 countries in the former @entity16 bloc to marry citizens from outside the @entity14			1
most couples met on the day of the wedding and needed an interpreter to get through their marriage vows			2
some of the grooms were dangerous career criminals from @entity24 suspected of murder , drugs trafficking and money laundering			2
but they won a right to live in the @entity4 because of their @entity14 ‘ wives ’			1
the scam , thought to be @entity4 ’s biggest marriage racket , ran on an ‘ industrial scale ’ for eight years			1
jailing the gang for a combined 35 years , judge @entity34 said their enterprise had been ‘ an attack on the institution of marriage ’ that drove ‘ a coach and horses through the immigration rules ’			1
he told them : ‘ a heavy responsibility for upholding the rule of law rests with lawyers			2
if the public can not trust the integrity of lawyers , who can they trust ? ’ @entity1 , 39 , was jailed for ten years , while his immigration adviser colleagues @entity52 , 41 , and @entity53 , 29 , received nine - year prison terms			1
@entity55 , 38 , was jailed for six years and nine months			1
the @entity57 judge added : ‘ there must , as a result of this case , be scores of people in this country , many of whom will be imposing a wholly undeserved burden on the hard - pressed taxpayer			0
‘ it represents an attack on the institution of marriage itself , treating it as a paper exercise involving two people who can not understand a word the other is saying and meeting , for all intents and purposes , on their wedding day			0
’ @entity78 , right , tried to blame workmate @entity53 for the crime but was found to be part of the racket that created ' sham marriages ' in order to obtain @entity4 passports along with @entity55 , left criminals would pay @entity86 , a law firm based in @entity87 , around £ 14,000 to arrange marriages with @entity90 women			1
the firm created ‘ touching love stories ’ to make the marriages with men from @entity24 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 appear genuine			1
brides were flown in each day on budget airlines and then housed in a grim tower block before being taken to register offices across the country			1
following the marriages the women would be paid a fee for their time and ordered never to contact their ‘ husbands ’ again			2
most would return to their home countries immediately			2
last night a source told the @entity110 that the scam had allowed ‘ dangerous criminals to operate freely ’ in @entity4			2
‘ we believe this to be the largest marriage fraud ever committed in the @entity4 , ’ the source said			0
‘ some of them are wanted for serious crimes in @entity24			0
others are suspects in murder investigations in this country			0
‘ these are the type of people who are being allowed to stay in the @entity4			0
i fear this type of crime will only get more prevalent when @entity126 and @entity127 are allowed to freely live here from next year			0
’ solicitor @entity1 , left , was jailed for 10 years for conspiracy to breach immigration law by arranging the sham marriages and @entity55 , right , pleaded guilty and was jailed for six years and nine months the defendants , three @entity133 and one from @entity134 , used the money to fund luxurious lifestyles			1
they bought a selection of properties in @entity87 and @entity139 and rewarded themselves with luxury cars			0
when @entity87 marriage officials grew suspicious about the number of weddings the firm was involved with , the gang simply switched to other parts of the country			2
marriage applications were made to appear genuine by enclosing fake documents including business accounts , tenancy agreements and references			2
forged affidavits containing details of the couples ’ supposed courtships were also included			0
@entity78 , 41 , left , was jailed for nine years and @entity158 national @entity53 , 29 , right , was jailed in his absence after fleeing the country while on bail in one dossier , @entity162 from @entity24 described how he met his bride - to - be @entity164 while on a day out with friends in 2008			1
the affidavit said : ‘ we went to a cafe where our friends left us alone to get on with it			0
‘ @entity164 was a bit shy but i eventually persuaded her to let me take her out			0
after three months i realised i wanted to be with her all the time and asked her to marry me			1
’ another client pretended he met his bride in a nightclub and proposed following a romantic @entity177 meal			0
@entity178 , prosecuting , said : ‘ the arrangement of these marriages was a lucrative business			0
‘ substantial sums were being paid to individuals to arrange these marriages			0
this was a cash business			0
’ the racket was uncovered after @entity4 police cracked an @entity24 drugs and money laundering ring in @entity87			0
