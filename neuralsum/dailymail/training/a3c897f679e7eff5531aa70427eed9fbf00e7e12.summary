@entity1 's columnists @entity2 and @entity3 tackle the key questions ahead of @entity7 's @entity6 opener against @entity8			1
@entity3 : i hope the players have watched the dvd of the match against @entity8 in the @entity13 in 2012			1
@entity7 ’s retention of the ball was appalling			1
it ’s ok having quick players but we must keep the ball and we do n’t do it well in our country			2
this is a game to change that			2
@entity2 : it ’s easy to stereotype the @entity26 team as one full of great defenders but i do n’t think this lot are up to it			2
we need to ask them serious questions from the off			2
@entity33 must get in the pocket to pester @entity35 and it is becoming increasingly hard to leave out @entity37			1
answer all our prayers : captain @entity39 will be vital if @entity7 are to start with a win @entity2 : @entity39			1
to play good football you need your best player in the middle and he ’s ours			0
his passing range , defensive responsibility and leadership are invaluable			0
@entity3 : i am pretty comfortable with the strikers and the midfield options , but our defence worries me			0
so i am going for @entity54			0
he needs to play the way that he plays for @entity56			0
everyone says @entity35 but he wo n’t surprise us			1
we know what he can do ( and he does it brilliantly )			0
@entity57 will look at this @entity7 central defensive pairing and think : ‘ there is joy in this for me ’			1
he is their box - office player , if he turns up in the right frame of mind			2
if he ’s focused and switched on , we ’ve got a problem			0
he will fancy his chances against us but the centre backs have to match his aggression and make sure they are first to every ball			2
he is a different animal playing for @entity8 but he ’s mentally unreliable and can be wound up			1
key man : @entity54 ( centre ) will be vital if @entity7 are to keep @entity8 out @entity2 : @entity7 ’s philosophy : play without fear			1
@entity3 : possession , pace , penetration			1
the three @entity85 @entity3 : the food			0
if you ’re in the area , get down to @entity89 ’s in @entity91 ’s @entity90 for a takeaway for the match			2
a sensational drive , despite my taxi driver ’s suicidal driving			0
@entity2 : watching @entity35 humiliate us in 2012 with his passing before capping it with that chipped penalty			1
@entity3 : @entity7 playing them in the @entity104 and lumping the ball from @entity106 to @entity107			1
humiliation : @entity35 's @entity109 penalty emphasised @entity8 's dominance of the ball in the @entity113 clash @entity3 : at home , with my family , writing notes for my @entity1 column			1
i hope i can write ‘ @entity39 is @entity7 ’s @entity35 ’ on monday morning			1
@entity2 : after a long day of travelling , most likely in a hotel bar in @entity120 with my @entity122 commentary team			0
@entity3 : ‘ keep the ball			0
’ @entity2 : ‘ do n’t forget to enjoy it			0
’ favourites : @entity2 admired @entity126 ( left ) , while @entity3 liked @entity127 ( right ) @entity2 : they have had such an outstanding collection of defenders but @entity126 was a one - off			2
his ability on the ball and the way he marshalled that defence was an inspiration			0
@entity3 : @entity127 , who played 47 times for @entity8 and 318 times for @entity139			1
i wanted to be him when i was a kid			0
the @entity26 press called him ‘ @entity142 ’			0
@entity3 : 1 - 1			1
cagey and tight and @entity143 making a difference , even if he has to wait to come on from the bench			0
i hope @entity146 will trust him and give him the opportunity			0
he can be @entity7 ’s game changer			1
@entity2 : 1 - 1			1
@entity8 will score first but we can finish the game strongly			2
hopefully our youngsters coming off the bench can give @entity146 plenty of selection dilemmas for the @entity156 game .			0

@entity7 have to *adhere* by 3 ps : pace , possession and penetration
@entity33 and @entity37 must pester @entity35
it is @entity57 , not @entity35 , who is @entity8 's key man
both @entity1 's *experts* think the match will end 1 - 1
