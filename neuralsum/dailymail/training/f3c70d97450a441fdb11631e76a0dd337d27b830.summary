by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 03:55 est , 26 july 2012 payoff : former @entity3 chief operating officer @entity2 has received a cash payoff worth almost £ 9million a @entity3 boss who resigned in disgrace over the interest rate rigging scandal has been handed a cash payoff worth almost £ 9million , it emerged last night			1
@entity2 will receive the £ 8.75million windfall despite ordering traders to manipulate crucial interest rates used to set mortgages and trillions of pounds in complex investments			1
@entity3 was fined £ 290million by @entity17 and @entity18 regulators over the scandal last month , leading to the resignation of chief executive @entity21 and chairman @entity22			1
news of the windfall emerged on the day that @entity25 – chairman of the bank ’s remuneration committee which sets bonuses – also quit for ‘ personal reasons ’			2
it is not known whether her resignation was in protest against the award for mr @entity2 , which is set to spark another row about the bonus culture in the @entity38			2
@entity39 , chairman of the @entity40 , said : ‘ this is staggering			0
why on earth should this man get a multi-million pound payoff for resigning in disgrace ? this is further proof that the whole system of bonuses needs to be urgently reformed			2
’ it is thought that the @entity51 banker ’s award represents just over half of a potential £ 17million long - term incentive award made to him several years ago and which matured in march			2
the payoff could spark further anger over the bonus culture in the @entity38 @entity57 , @entity21 's former right - hand man , giving evidence to the @entity59 at the @entity60 last week insiders say mr @entity21 ’s former right - hand man and chief operating officer was persuaded to delay receiving the bonus because of escalating public anger over pay			1
the windfall is thought to have been settled on to secure mr del @entity69 ’s signature on his severance package			0
it comes despite promises from @entity3 , and led by @entity25 as the executive in charge of pay at the bank , to claw back bonuses from mr @entity21 and fellow directors			1
@entity21 , former chief executive of @entity3 , walked away with a £ 2million package mr @entity21 forfeited bonuses worth up to £ 20million amid a growing public outcry but still walked away with a £ 2million package			1
but mr del @entity69 ’s decision to pocket the cash will mean he will join his former colleague as a lightning rod for criticism over rewards for failure			0
earlier this month he was identified as the @entity3 executive who instructed junior colleagues to rig benchmark libor rates , used to set mortgages , during the financial crisis			1
in an appearance before the @entity59 of @entity97 last week he claimed he was instructed to do so by mr @entity21 following a phone call between his former boss and @entity100 , deputy governor of the @entity101			1
@entity102 from shareholder lobby group @entity103 , said : ‘ this is enough to make you sick			0
@entity3 must make it clear immediately if there was any discretion involved in this settlement , and if so they should make clear which directors approved it			0
‘ in any case this decision is likely to incense shareholders , particularly if any of the payoff includes rewards relating to the period in which the bank was involved in @entity120 manipulation			0
’ @entity3 refused to comment			0
but the bank is understood to have felt it could not legally claw back the cash payout to mr @entity2 , given he was entitled to receive it in the spring			0
it is unclear whether he will be able to keep separate share options thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds .			0
