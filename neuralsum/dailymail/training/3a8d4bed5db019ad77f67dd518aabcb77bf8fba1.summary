by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 23:29 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 23:29 est , 3 june 2013 @entity3 sen. @entity2 is mad as hell at the @entity5 and it 's not going to take it anymore : the conservative legislator wants the tax agency gone for good @entity3 @entity10 sen. @entity2 is a conservative 's conservative , and the @entity5 's rampant political favoritism has brought him back to one of this signature campaign issues : getting rid of the tax collection agency for good			1
' in recent weeks the @entity5 has admitted to unlawfully targeting conservative groups , and trying to silence the president 's critics , ' he says in a web video launched may 27			1
federal legislators , he says ' need to make sure it never happens again			0
it 's time to abolish the @entity5			2
' the video , which also ran last week as an audio - only ad during @entity27 / @entity26 simulcasts of @entity29 programs , was produced by the @entity30 , a wealthy political action committee that spent $ 3.5 million on candidate races in the 2012 election cycle			1
that amount put it in the top 13 percent of big - money pacs , according to the @entity36			0
@entity2 's senate campaign was the fund 's second biggest recipient , taking in more than $ 315,000			1
only @entity41 treasurer @entity40 , who failed in his bid to unseat @entity44 sen. @entity43 , received more money from the political committee			2
but it seems @entity2 himself , not the @entity10 - leaning fund , is driving his embrace of a doomsday scenario for @entity53 's widely feared tax collection agency			1
' the senator has spoken about this since his campaign , ' @entity2 spokeswoman @entity54 told @entity58			2
' he believes that our tax code should be simple enough that there would be no need for an agency like the @entity5 , ' @entity59 said			2
' this is an issue of principle			0
that pac spent more than $ 3.5 million on political races in 2012 in a @entity29 interview with @entity78 host @entity69 on sunday , @entity2 contended that @entity80 's presidency gave the @entity5 's recent history of unethical behavior greater urgency			1
' the @entity80 administration has demonstrated a willingness to use the machinery of government to target their political enemies , and that 's wrong , ' he said			0
' it was wrong when @entity91 did it , and it 's wrong when @entity80 did it			0
' ' it is a manifestation of too much power in the federal government , ' @entity2 continued			0
' when the federal government has that much power in our individual lives , it 's an invitation to being abused			0
the articles of impeachment against president @entity91 included the allegation that he tried ' to cause , in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens , income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner ' writer @entity112 ( @entity113 ) gave $ 5,000 to the @entity30 , which donated $ 315,000 to @entity2 's 2012 @entity30 campaign , and launched a video in which he calls for the @entity5 to be shuttered permanently			1
@entity117 ceo @entity116 ( r ) donated $ 1,500			0
' i think we ought to abolish the @entity5 and instead move to a simple flat tax , where the average @entity53 can fill out our taxes on a postcard , ' @entity2 told @entity69 , ' saying @entity53 should be able to ' put down how much you earn , put down a deduction for charitable contributions , for [ a ] home mortgage , and how much you owe			1
' taxpayers , he said , should be motivated to ' take the [ @entity5 ] agents , the bureaucracy out of @entity1 , and limit the power of government			0
' he also had strong words for the @entity80 administration 's planned use of the @entity5 to administer the president 's signature health care overhaul law , the @entity135			1
@entity137 , head of the @entity5 unit that decides whether to grant tax - exempt status to groups , was placed on paid suspension after she refused to tell @entity142 what she knew about the extra scrutiny the @entity5 gave to tea party and other conservative groups that applied for tax - exempt status ' right now the @entity5 is creating the largest database in the country to implement @entity135 , ' @entity2 claimed , ' and the intrusion into our personal lives , i think is unacceptable			1
' ' the pattern we ’ve seen is its not something we can trust will be administered in a fair way			0
it ’s not something we can trust wo n’t be used in a partisan way			0
' the idea of an @entity5 - run health care database has been a hotly contested one , with liberal advocates calling the suggestion false on its face			2
but the @entity169 editorial board wrote on may 14 that the @entity5 and the @entity170 are ' now building the largest personal information database the government has ever attempted			0
' ' known as the @entity174 , the project is taking the @entity5 's own records ( for income and employment status ) and centralizing them with information from @entity179 ( identity ) , @entity181 ( citizenship ) , justice ( criminal history ) , @entity170 ( enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data ) and state governments ( residency )			2
' the data hub , ' according to the @entity169 , ' will be used as the verification system for @entity135 's complex subsidy formula			2
' @entity193 groups staged protests against the @entity5 in more than a dozen cities on may 21			0
the agency has acknowledged using political criteria to target some applicants for tax - exempt status the @entity30 , the pac that launched @entity2 's video campaign , has collected contributions of $ 200 or more from 7,765 people , according to @entity204 disclosure reports			1
among those donors are author @entity112 and @entity207 ceo @entity206 , who gave $ 5,000 each ; @entity209 vice president @entity208 , who contributed $ 2,500 ; and @entity117 ceo @entity116 , who gave $ 1,500 .			1

a political action committee that gave sen. @entity2 $ 315,000 for his 2012 campaign has launched an online video to push the idea
the @entity218 's donors include writer @entity112 , the @entity219 of @entity207 and carnival cruise lines , and a @entity209 vice president
@entity2 says @entity53 should be able to file their taxes on a postcard
the @entity5 , he claims , ca *n't* be trusted to *impartially* implement the tax subsidies that form the basis for @entity135
@entity5 *officials* admitted targeting right - wing organizations for an *inordinate* amount of scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status
