a three year old was left alone in a pre-school for almost two hours after staff forgot to take her on a class trip to the woods			1
the girl 's parents said they were extremely concerned when they learnt of the incident because the toddler has a pre-existing condition which affects the structure of her skull and makes her incredibly vulnerable if she falls or has an accident			1
staff at @entity15 , in @entity16 , @entity17 , did not notice the child , who is not being identified , was missing until they returned to the building from the trip to nearby woods			1
an @entity23 inspection following the incident found that registers were not being completed properly , meaning staff had no accurate record of the number of children being taken on trips			1
@entity31 , where the three year old was left to run around the pre-school while her classmates were out the child had the run of the village hall school			1
her mother said it was extremely lucky her daughter was not harmed during the incident that happened on september 22 this year			2
the child 's mother , who has two other children , said : ' there was a very small group of children there			0
how could they have missed her ? ' we are really grateful that she was n't hurt , but who knows what could have happened			0
' if she had fallen or hit her head it could have been catastrophic			2
i just do n't want it to happen again			0
' she added : ' i have received a letter from the pre-school committee which says they will be investigating the incident but that any disciplinary action taken will not be divulged to us because of confidentiality			2
headquarters of @entity66 where councillors say they are helping the school address the issue the woman made a complaint to @entity23 which carried out an unannounced inspection days later			1
inspectors found that there were no risk assessments in place ahead of such trips and that registers were not completed correctly to provide an accurate record of the number of children present			0
no member of staff at the pre-school has lost their job over it			2
@entity23 inspectors have served the pre-school with a welfare requirement notice , which demands they introduce a series measures to ensure there is no repeat of the incident			1
this is enforceable by law			0
one of those is to ensure that while children are on and off the premises they are accounted for at all times			0
@entity99 , chairman of @entity100 , said the staff involved in the incident remained in their positions			0
she said : ' following @entity23 's recommendations and results of the pre-school committee 's own internal investigation , the pre-school immediately implemented measures to ensure such an incident can not re-occur			1
' we take this opportunity to thank parents for their incredible ongoing support at this time			0
' according the @entity23 's most recent routine inspection report , the pre-school caters for a maximum of 22 children			1
a spokesman for @entity66 said : ' the pre-school leader of @entity15 contacted the council 's early years team with a report of a safeguarding issue			0
' so far , we have supported @entity15 by helping them address the actions set out in @entity23 's compliance notice			2
we have also put in place a number of actions for the pre-school to adopt to ensure this never happens again			0
