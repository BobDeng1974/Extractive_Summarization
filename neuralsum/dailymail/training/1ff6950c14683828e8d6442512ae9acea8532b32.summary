by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:12 pm on 28th october 2011 the son of @entity4 guitarist @entity3 will spend @entity5 behind bars after his appeal against a 16 - month jail term for his drug - fuelled rampage during the student protests was thrown out			1
@entity11 , 21 , was told those who join mob violence must expect ‘ significant ’ sentences , even if their actions are completely out of character			1
lawyers for the @entity19 history student argued his sentence was ‘ unduly harsh ’ and that he should be released early			1
paying the price : @entity11 , pictured with his mother , author @entity24 , and father @entity4 guitarist @entity3 during his trial but three @entity28 judges ruled that the penalty could not be described as ‘ manifestly excessive or wrong in principle ’			1
in what became one of the most infamous images of the @entity35 protests , @entity3 was seen hanging from a @entity36 on the @entity37			1
in a clear warning to others , @entity38 said those who take part in demonstrations carry ‘ clear responsibilities ’ to avoid disorder and violence			2
the earliest @entity3 can now be released from @entity47 prison in @entity48 is next march , when he reaches the halfway point of his sentence			2
he admitted violent disorder after joining thousands protesting in @entity53 and @entity54 last december			2
@entity3 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , was ' out of his mind ' on lsd , whisky and valium when he indulged in ' outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour ' at last december 's student riots			1
he was jailed for 16 months in july after admitting a charge of violent disorder - but his lawyer had argued that the sentence was ' unduly harsh '			1
@entity3 was seen swinging on the @entity36 at the @entity37 just hours before he hurled a bin at a car escorting the @entity68 and @entity69 on december 9 last year			1
however , the court had previously heard that he did not realise that the monument from which he was swinging was the @entity37			1
the dark side of the son : @entity11 was seen rampaging through the streets of @entity35 and was photographed clambering up the @entity37 @entity3 jumped on the bonnet of the car , which was carrying close protection officers , blocking the driver 's view of the @entity81 's @entity80 in front , it had been claimed			1
@entity3 was also accused of twice kicking a window of @entity84 in @entity85 as staff and customers cowered inside			0
his parents did not attend the @entity89 for the appeal announcement			0
describing the decision to uphold the 16 - month sentence , @entity38 said @entity3 's offence was committed in the centre of @entity35 ' in the course of serious disorder which occurred in the later stages of what had begun as a generally peaceful demonstration against @entity101 proposals relating to the funding of further education '			1
there was , he said , ' serious mob disorder '			0
rampage : @entity3 's lawyer said he had been ' playing the fool ' and ' acting up ' for cameras he said : ' the defendant admitted violent disorder			1
he was unmistakably captured on @entity113 footage in @entity85 joining in the attack on the windows of a shop			0
' he was part of a violent crowd laying siege to the shop , in which both staff and shoppers were trapped			1
' he twice ran up and launched heavy kicks at the window , as did others before him and , no doubt , after him			0
' the combined effect of the attack was that the windows were at some stage broken - it may well be by the time the defendant joined in			2
' the defendant helped himself to a section of a mannequin and carried it away			0
' lord @entity38 said the @entity138 's case was that @entity3 also took violent part in the attack on the royal cars a little earlier			1
there was evidence that @entity3 was ' quite significantly under the influence of both drink and drugs that day '			0
at times during the day he was clearly ' in good , if intoxicated , humour ' , the court was told			2
in @entity54 earlier in the day ' he can be seen shouting good - humouredly and at another point declaiming poetry '			2
the judge said : ' unfortunately , however , his behaviour was not always in this benevolent category			2
' at one point ' there is no doubt that he crouched down in the doorway of the nearby @entity158 and tried to set fire to a bundle of newspapers against the wooden doors ' , but was ' dissuaded and scampered away '			0
lord @entity38 added : ' that can not have been other than potentially very dangerous and , in the context of a volatile crowd , very likely to lead others to behave equally dangerously			2
' he went on : ' a little later he was to be found swinging in an exhibitionist manner and for quite a prolonged period on one of the flags on the @entity37			1
' this was an incident which , unsurprisingly , subsequently attracted a good deal of attention			0
shock : prince @entity175 and the @entity69 in their car when it was attacked by protesters last december			0
@entity11 was convicted of hurling a bin at the escort car behind the royals ' deeply offensive as it undoubtedly was , it did not amount to violence and thus was not part of the offence of violent disorder with which he was charged			1
' its relevance in law is limited to the fact that , along with the other behaviour , it demonstrates that he was at times over-excited , out of control , and raising the temperature in a manner which could only be dangerous in the context of a large and angry crowd			2
' at the original sentencing hearing at @entity203 , the judge concluded that he was sure @entity3 had thrown a bin at a car in the royal convoy - which had been conveying the @entity81 , the @entity69 and others to an evening public engagement			1
the appeal judges ruled that he was ' entitled to come to the conclusion which he did '			0
lord @entity38 said of @entity3 : ' he is plainly a talented man			0
' references from people who knew him well described him as a person who is ' generally of gentle and peaceable disposition '			0
he said the judge at @entity203 ' rightly treated what the defendant did as entirely out of character '			2
the appeal judges agreed with @entity3 's barrister that testimonials from a national charity for the homeless painted a ' picture of his capacity to behave very differently ' from the way he did on december 9 last year			1
he had earned ' considerable praise for respect for others , long hours , reliability and enthusiasm '			0
it was also clear , said @entity232 , that ' he has been much chastened by the realisation of what he did '			0
disgraceful : the convoy of royal cars transporting prince @entity175 and the @entity69 can be seen in this image being attacked during the student riots in @entity239 he added : ' he has made genuine efforts to stop drinking and taking drugs			1
he made a public apology soon after the event , stimulated no doubt by the heavy publicity which the graphic pictures of the @entity37 incident had generated			1
' the law protects the right of people in this country to demonstrate - to ' make known and in public their feelings on matters of public concern ' - but to do so in large numbers in public ' carries clear responsibilities , principally amongst them to act without disorder or violence which puts the public at risk '			2
the attack on the shops in @entity85 ' was an attack by a mob on hapless shoppers and staff who were terrified as well as trapped inside , whilst the attack on the cars was upon both public figures and those whose job it was to protect them '			0
injured : a police officer is hurt during the student riots last december lord @entity38 said : ' it is an unavoidable feature of mass disorder that each individual act , whatever might be its character taken on its own , inflames and encourages others to behave similarly , and that the harm done to the public stems from the combined effect of what is done en masse			1
' we do not believe that violence in this context and of the kind displayed by this defendant can normally be met by other than significant sentences of immediate custody even for those of otherwise good character			0
' the sentence passed by the judge ' correctly took account both of the defendant 's serious and dangerous acts in this inflammatory context and of his normal character '			1
lord @entity38 said the sentence was a ' penalty which properly met the facts of this case '			0
at an @entity28 hearing earlier this month , @entity304 , @entity3 's lawyer , told the court that @entity3 did not realise it was the @entity37 he was swinging on because he had grown up in the countryside without access to television			1
he made the revelation about his client 's upbringing while arguing that the 16 - month prison sentence should be reduced so he can finish his degree at @entity19			1
mr @entity304 said : '' he had no recollection of throwing the bin			0
he is confident if he threw the bin , he would have remembered '			0
he also argued his client had simply being ' playing the fool ' and ' acting up ' for cameras during the day			0
disputing the length of @entity3 's jail sentence , mr @entity304 said : ' a shorter , sharp shock would be perfectly sufficient to punish him , and at the same time to send a message loud and clear to others who might be minded to act as he did			1
' this sentence was unduly harsh , unnecessarily so , his potential , like that of other young people in his position is being wasted while he spends too long in prison			0
' during the sentencing hearing at @entity203 , it was said that just before his violent outbursts on december 9 last year , @entity3 had ' binged ' on whisky and valium			2
in his mitigation , mr @entity304 explained how @entity3 had become increasingly ' dependent ' on drink and drugs since he was rejected by his biological father , the poet and playwrite @entity340 four months before the incident			0
and the night before , the ' gentle ' and ' promising ' student had binged on lsd and alcohol			0
lord @entity38 , sitting with mr @entity347 and mr @entity348 , reserved judgement earlier this month because they wanted to wait for the judgement of the lord chief justice in the sentences imposed on the august rioters , in case there were ' implications ' for @entity3 's case			0
@entity3 was adopted by rock star @entity3 , worth £ 78million , when he married his mother , writer and journalist @entity24			0

@entity19 *undergraduate* reading history claimed he did not know what the @entity37 was
@entity11 was seen swinging from monument during student riots
court decides 21 - year - old 's sentence was neither excessive nor wrong
judge says he was ' part of a violent crowd '
