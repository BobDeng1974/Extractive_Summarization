by @entity0 and @entity1 it was a miracle he made it out to sea at all			2
yet this young @entity6 migrant had hoped to cross the channel on a raft made of a few nailed - together bits of plank , with a bedsheet held by tent poles for a sail			1
his desperate attempt reach @entity15 almost ended in disaster as his makeshift craft was blown into the path of a @entity20 passenger ferry near @entity21			1
fortunately the crew of the @entity23 spotted the 23 - year - old			1
if you got points for effort ... @entity29 coast guard rescue @entity28 who tried to cross the channel on a makeshift raft using a bedsheet as a sail when rescued from the world ’s busiest shipping lane , he was drenched and suffering from hypothermia			1
he told @entity29 coastguards his dream was to ‘ travel to @entity40 to start a new life ’ and he would stop at nothing to get here			0
coastguard chief @entity42 said the young migrant , spotted drifting off @entity44 on monday at 2pm , would never have made it to the @entity15			1
his raft was so flimsy he would probably have been killed – and the wind was in the wrong direction , blowing him up the coast rather than across the @entity30			0
‘ he was upset at being caught to begin with , but was then very happy to be safe , ’ said mr @entity42			0
‘ if the wind had risen , or the raft had collided with a ferry , then he would have capsized and died			2
’ the man , who had no documents and refused to give his name , received medical treatment before being handed over to @entity29 border police			0
last night sources in @entity21 said the man would almost certainly have been released without charge – leaving him free to try to reach the @entity15 again			1
his desperate attempt comes as many of the hundreds massing in @entity21 to get to @entity15 increasingly put their lives in danger by plunging into the sea			1
mr @entity42 said the man had built his raft using wooden planks , a float wrapped in tarpaulin , and a table leg supporting a makeshift mast and white sheet			0
the man , who did not have any documents on him and can not be identified , was dressed in a blue tracksuit and woolly hat , and carried all his possessions in a small rucksack on his back			0
mr @entity42 said the @entity6 's brave solo effort , discovered on monday , was undoubtedly nothing to do with the gangs of people smugglers currently operating in @entity21			2
‘ they do not encourage migrants to travel alone , and certainly not in the sea , ’ he said , saying that the migrant was ‘ handed over to the border police ’ after medical treatment			2
he was then likely to be freed without charge – leaving him free to continue to try and get to @entity15 , where he will claim asylum or else disappear into the black economy			1
@entity29 is to bulldoze camps containing hundreds of illegal migrants hoping to travel to @entity15 from @entity21 because of a growing danger to public health , it emerged today local prefect @entity100 also said there were particular ' fears for public health ' , especially as the makeshift camps do not have basic supplies like water last month four would - be immigrants to @entity15 were taken to hospital suffering from severe hypothermia after being caught in the sea off @entity21			1
in a further sign of the desperate methods being used by the migrants , all were trying to get aboard @entity40 - bound ferries moored in the harbour			2
it follows four other migrants dying in a single week in @entity21 as they risked life and limb for the chance to claim residency in the @entity15			1
clutching waterproof bundles full of food and other essentials , the men swam out from @entity127 , part of the city ’s ancient fortifications			0
‘ the idea was to swim out to the ferries so as to avoid customs and other checks , ’ said a local police spokesman			0
‘ @entity137 spotted them , and alerted the authorities			0
port patrol cars were on the quay alongside them within a few minutes			0
’ police in the @entity29 port said that many of the settlements would be ' cleared by the end of next week , ' to stop them getting bigger the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police as they try their luck at getting to @entity15 three of the men were plucked out of the water relatively easily , but one went missing and got into difficulty into deep water			1
the body of an @entity160 who also tried to swim across the harbour drowned in exactly the same spot last october			0
hundreds of migrants from outside the @entity165 are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of @entity21 port			2
charities say there are more than 650 in the town , the greatest number since the closure of the @entity175 camp at @entity44 in 2002 – and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence			0
there are currently up to 1000 migrants living rough in @entity21 , with up to 650 around the port area alone on march 9 an @entity184 man was killed on a motorway outside the town			1
three days later , @entity188 @entity187 was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port			0
the body of a 25 - year - old @entity188 man , @entity193 , was found in @entity21 ’s @entity195 dock on march 14 and the next day a fellow @entity188 in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter			1
it is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction			0
the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police as they try their luck at getting to @entity15 .			2
