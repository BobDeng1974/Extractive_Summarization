i very much want to have contact with you as an audience , not with @entity45 , @entity46 or cameras			0
' i know it 's a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together			2
' the @entity53 singer has asked fans not to film , or take pictures , of her upcoming gig @entity2 last performed at the @entity8 in may 1979 and will play at the same venue on tuesday the @entity53 singer is not the first musician to criticise gig - goers who spend their time using their mobile devices rather than watching the show			1

he said : ' i feel sorry for them , i really feel sorry for them			0
looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you 're doing that , you 're 50 per cent there , right ? it 's weird			2
