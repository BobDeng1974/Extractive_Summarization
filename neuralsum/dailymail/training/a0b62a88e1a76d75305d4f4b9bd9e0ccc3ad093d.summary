by @entity0 published : 13:56 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 14:37 est , 30 january 2013 it has been revealed that secret salary records of more than one - third of @entity3 have been shared by their employers with the credit rating agency @entity6			1
described as one of the biggest privacy breaches of the modern age , 190 million employment and salary records have been sold to debt collectors and financial service companies through an @entity6 - owned subsidiary called @entity15			1
originally created as a fast and easy way to check the employment history of new staff , it has been revealed that @entity15 's database is so detailed it contains week - by - week paycheck information dating back years for tens of millions of people			1
openly describing itself as a member of the @entity25 holds almost 200 million individual personal records of @entity3 citizens worryingly , @entity15 also stores other sensitive information about @entity3 citizens such as their health care provider , if they have dental insurance and if they 've ever filed an unemployment claim			1
' it 's the biggest privacy breach in our time , and it ’s legal and no one knows it ’s going on , ' said @entity38 , who operates an employment background company named @entity40			1
' it 's like a secret @entity42			0
' in 2009 , @entity6 said the data covered 30 percent of the @entity3 working population , and it now says @entity15 is adding 12 million records annually			1
@entity6 and @entity15 obtain the information through thousands of @entity3 businesses , including a large number of firms that comprise the @entity50			1
indeed , 85 - percent of civilians employed by the federal government , including staff at the @entity54 and schools have their information freely made available to @entity6			1
the reason for this is to allow the credit bureau to have the latest information about the working population and in turn some of the firms that provide the information also pay @entity6 to collate it			2
in 2009 , @entity6 said the data they own covered 30 percent of the @entity3 working population , and it now says @entity15 is adding 12 million records annually @entity66 , a privacy expert who operates @entity69 expressed shock at firms selling data to debt collectors at their end , @entity6 sells some of the sensitive information to debt collectors			1
the investigation by @entity79 sought comment from @entity6 and they declined to be interviewed			0
however , the firm confirmed that it shares ' employment data ' with financial service and debt collecting companies , but that it does so in compliance with @entity89 guidelines			1
' in all cases , these entities must have a permissible purpose to request employment information , ' @entity6 spokesman @entity90 said to @entity79			2
he added that consumers allow third parties the right to access data ' at the time of application ' for credit			2
' a consumer grants verifiers ( creditors ) and their assigned debt collectors the right to verify employment should the consumer default on their account , ' he said			2
the reason why @entity15 has become so popular is because it gives companies a simple way to outsource the employment verification of staff			1
firms dislike the drain on human resources that human resource departments endure through confirming references when a former employee applies for a new job			0
therefore , they have begun to use @entity15 , which was part of @entity124 based firm @entity123 until @entity6 purchased it for $ 1.4 billion in 2007			0
however , @entity15 is not secretive - it allows prospective landlords a simple way to verify a prospective tenants income			2
it 's the biggest privacy breach in our time , and it 's legal and no one knows it 's going on , ' said @entity38 , who operates an employment background company some consumers have found though that the level of information available online outstrips what they are comfortable with			2
@entity79 spoke with @entity139 of @entity140 , @entity141 , who looked up her own @entity15 report and found it was 22 - pages long			2
it listed every paycheck she had received for years and the first page of the report helpfully lists ' verifiers who have requested your data in the past 24 - months			2
' @entity139 saw that ' @entity156 and @entity157 ' a law firm that specialises in debt collection was listed			0
' i found out debt collectors can access this information , which is strange , ' said @entity139			0
i assumed with @entity25 , for that information , you had to have a ( passcode ) … but they got in , and got it somehow without my consent			0
' in his statement to @entity167 , @entity6 spokesman @entity90 said that ' pay rate ' information is shared with third parties , such as ' mortgage , auto and other financial services credit grantors			1
' he did though , deny that salary information is sold to debt collectors			2
' @entity177 agencies may request employment information -- which may be nothing more than verifying that a consumer is working where they say they are – if it qualifies under permissible purpose , ' he wrote in his statement to @entity79			1
' collections agencies are not provided salary information			1
' credit rating agencies are multi-billion corporations in the @entity3 and affect the financial well - being of millions this directly contradicts what @entity6 ceo @entity190 said in 2009 , when he spoke about @entity25			1
' with @entity193 and @entity123 we can provide information about a debtor ’s location , income and employment , ' said @entity190 in an interview published on @entity201 ’s website , referring to @entity25 ’s former parent company			2
' that can help prioritize which accounts to pursue first			0
if they ’re employed , that business has a better shot at collecting what is owed to them			0
' to counter that , @entity90 said that @entity190 misspoke when he described @entity123 's services and said that salary information is not sold to debt collectors			2
@entity38 has worked in the emplyment data business for over two decades and said that if @entity3 's thought that their employers gave away personal information they would be shocked			1
' the story here is how ( @entity25 ) is getting this information , ' said @entity38			0
' when people find out , no respectable employer will continue to do this			0
' @entity38 has worked in the emplyment data business for over two decades and said that if @entity3 's thought that their employers gave away personal information they would be shocked @entity79 spoke to @entity66 , a privacy expert who operates @entity69			1
he expressed shock at firms selling data to debt collectors			0
' are you joking ? @entity238 , i 'm shocked , ' said @entity66			0
' this is unbelievably scary			0
i consider payroll information very sensitive and private			0
' ' if the public knew about this , there would be such outrage , ' he said			0
' it 's just ... really depressing			0
' currently , data brokers are under two separate congressional investigations and the @entity249 announced in december that it had begun an inquiry into how brokers obtain their information			0
however , agencies which report credit ratings , such as @entity25 are considered separate from data brokers and are governed by special rules			1
it is therse separate rules that are what @entity6 operates its salary information under said @entity262 , a lawyer with the @entity249			0
' it ’s not as easy as it should be to say whether debt collectors can get your consumer reports , because it depends on the circumstance , ' she said , adding that she believed @entity6 could have the right to sell the salary information to debt collectors because it is part of a credit report			1
' there are special restrictions on how credit reports can be used in hiring decisions , but there are no special restrictions on how employment reports ( such as salary information ) is used for non-employment purposes			1
' ' they are a credit bureau			0
they sell credit information to lenders			0

over 190 million employment and salary records of @entity3 citizens have been shared by their employers with credit rating agencies
this allows anyone signing up to their subsidiary companies to view salary and health insurance details of one - third of *adults* in the @entity3
