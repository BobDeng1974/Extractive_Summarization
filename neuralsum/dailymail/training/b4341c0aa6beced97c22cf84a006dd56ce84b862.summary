@entity0 will be ' swamped ' by tuberculosis unless new measures to diagnose the disease a leading doctor has warned that @entity0 will be ‘ swamped ’ by tuberculosis unless new measures to diagnose the disease in immigrants are introduced			1
the disease , which was rife in @entity0 until the 1950s , is an increasing and worrying problem in urban areas			1
rising immigration has seen a surge in cases in the last 20 years			0
under current rules , new immigrants from countries where @entity16 is common are required to have chest x-rays before being allowed into @entity0			1
but doctors argue this century - old method only spots active tb once it is already destroying the lungs – meaning cases are often diagnosed far too late			1
other countries such as the @entity24 use a blood test , which can detect the latent @entity16 in those not displaying any symptoms			1
cases have fallen since this technique was introduced in 2007			0
at the @entity34 conference this week , @entity30 of the @entity31 and @entity32 , said urgent changes were needed to halt the decades - long rise in @entity16 cases			2
he told @entity41 : ‘ the tide has been coming in for 20 years , it ’s been getting bigger and bigger and if we do n’t do something we will be swamped with @entity16 as we were 100 years ago			0
’ @entity16 is caused by a bacterium that spreads through saliva			0
the disease used to be known as consumption because the bacterium ate holes in the lungs			0
from 50,000 cases a year in @entity0 in the 1950s , the rate fell to 5,000 in the 1980s			1
@entity16 is a bacterial infection which is spread by inhaling drops of saliva when an infected person coughs , speaks or sneezes			0
the disease mainly affects the lungs , but can travel to other parts of the body including the brain , kidneys , bones and joints			0
the disease is curable with a six - month course of antibiotics , but a drug - resistant form can develop if the course is not completed			2
left untreated it can prove fatal			0
symptoms include a persistent cough that lasts for more than three weeks that gets progressively worse , unexplained weight loss , fever , night sweats , chest pain , fatigue and loss of appetite			2
however , many people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the bacteria remain in the body , they are not infectious			1
last year there were just over 9,000 cases of @entity16 - a five per cent increase on the year before , according to figures from the @entity89			1
the main risk area is still @entity91 with 3,588 cases reported in 2011 , accounting for 40 per cent of the @entity0 total			2
and nearly three quarters of those suffering the disease were those not born in the @entity0			2
professor @entity30 and his peers recommend that people from the @entity101 subcontinent and @entity102 , where rates are highest , should be given the blood test when registering with a gp			1
those found to have latent @entity16 can easily eliminate it with a course of antibiotics			0
speaking about the blood test , he said : ‘ it ’s a no - brainer			1
if we screen for latent @entity16 we would eliminate the majority of cases of people coming into this country			2
now we ’ve got the blood tests , for goodness ’ sake let ’s use them			0
’ he added that with @entity16 claiming up to 500 deaths a year , the numbers were as many as @entity121			0
the homeless and drug addicts should also be screened because new infections have become more common among these groups , he continued			0
@entity126 , chief executive of the charity @entity127 , said : ‘ the truth is that @entity16 never really went away in the @entity0 and has been steadily rising here , from around 5,000 cases a year at the end of the @entity132 to 8,500 in 2007/8			1
‘ @entity16 is a disease usually associated with certain high - risk groups such as those with @entity121 , those from @entity138 countries and @entity139 , and those living in crowded living conditions			0
but anyone can get it			0
' @entity143 , a consultant at @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity91 , said that rates of the disease are continuing to rise and that the @entity0 has the highest rates in @entity149			2
last year there were just over 9,000 cases of @entity16 - a five per cent increase on the year before , according to figures from the @entity89 echoing the sentiments of mr @entity126 , he said even low risk people are susceptible if the disease is out of control , it being possible to become infected by being in the same room as someone with @entity16			1
he added that people should not become careless about the risks because they did n’t fit the traditional demographic of someone who gets the disease			0
his research has found that a fifth of immigrants to @entity0 from high - risk areas had latent tb – but the current guidelines for screening men around 75 per cent of these cases will be missed , so the real figure may be substantially higher			1
the @entity173 said that in line with @entity177 guidance , the @entity174 currently uses both chest x-ray screening and blood - testing to check for @entity16 , with the evidence for new technologies kept under review			1

9,000 cases of tuberculosis in the @entity0 last year - up 5 *%* on the year before
immigrants currently screened using chest x-ray
but *experts* argue this 100 - year - old method only spots people with advanced disease , meaning many with no symptoms are missed
calling for blood test used in the @entity24 to be standard test
