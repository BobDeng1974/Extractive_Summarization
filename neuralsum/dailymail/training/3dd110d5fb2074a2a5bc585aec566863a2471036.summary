a good soak in a hot bath is really all you need on a cold day			0
snow monkeys living near the resort of @entity4 , in the heart of central @entity7 's hot springs country , have taken to spending much of their time hanging out in the warm waters			1
and while the macaques are already well prepared for @entity7 's harsh winters , boasting a thick coat of sand - coloured fur , their bright red faces seem most relaxed when they fall asleep in the warm pools			1
the water in the naturally hot springs can get very hot and can reach temperatures of between 60 to 90 degrees @entity21 ( 15 - 32 degrees @entity22 )			2
though these @entity7 macaques can be found in other parts of the country , the monkeys here are considered unusual for their love of hot water - and are among the best - loved symbols of wild @entity7			1
at @entity32 , or @entity33 , snow covers for approximately four months of the year with temperatures averaging minus ten degrees @entity22 ) during winter months			2
snow monkeys living in @entity7 's hot springs country spend most of their time hanging out in the warm water the water in the springs can get very hot , reaching temperatures of up to 15 - 32 degrees @entity22 mr. @entity40 , one of five employees at @entity42 , says the @entity7 macaques have adopted a small build to survive such extreme weather conditions			1
' the typical features of @entity7 macaques are their short tails and small ears , ' he says			2
' these descriptions form the basis of @entity52 's rule - that animals in colder climates have shorter appendages particularly in temperatures below zero - which means their petite physical features total to a smaller surface area allowing them to be less exposed to the cold , thus being protected from forming frost bite			2
' a lot of time is also spent grooming , which is important to strengthen bonds between the monkeys , so they carefully pick lice out of each other 's fur coat @entity42 is where many of the macaques call home , spending time bathing and grooming the close bonds forged amongst members of the snow monkey troop of approximately 160 attract many tourists			1
despite its relatively remote location , roughly 100,000 visitors trek through the woods of @entity84 each year to visit the macaques at the @entity85			1
and the tourists ' favourite gadget - the camera - has evolved over the past half century			2
despite the remote location , roughly 100,000 visitors trek through the woods of @entity84 each year to visit now everyone wants a selfie with a snow monkey , but it remains unclear whether the monkeys are keen to participate			1
' when taking pictures with a smart phone , you stretch your arms out without realising , it is easy for people to stretch their arms out wide , which , from a monkey 's point of view , this closely resembles the act of physical force , ' says @entity40			0
and getting the primates to look at the camera is proving to be a whole other challenge , as @entity110 tourist @entity109 has quickly realised			0
and it seems as though what everyone really wants is a photo of the monkeys - up close and personal ! ' i heard that the selfie stick was really big in @entity7 , so i bought my first one , and i 'm trying to get my first selfie picture with the snow monkey , ' she says			1
' i 've got a few , but i 'm trying to get one with our faces looking at the camera			0
' @entity123 and @entity124 , @entity126 tourists from @entity127 , are also adopting the selfie stick for their family photos			0
' we 're trying to take a selfie to make the monkey look like it 's taking the selfie with us in it , if you know what i mean , but , it 's not working out for us , ' they explain , before continuing to perfect their shot			0
in order to keep the wild monkeys from getting spooked , tourists are encouraged to use selfie sticks however , there are concerns that some technologies are alarming to the monkeys			1
drones , @entity40 says , are particularly risky as they resemble certain animals that the monkeys are wary of			0
' some people have even attempted to use drones , which have the capability of shooting video as it flies into the sky			0
' however , monkeys really dislike this kind of device , as for them it resembles animals that fly within close distance to them , ' he warns			0
the unusual creatures have long been considered a favoured symbol of wild @entity7 ' in @entity7 , there is a creature called @entity168 , which looks like a squirrel with a pair of wings and it flies between trees			1
' when the monkeys see them they panic , and once they start panicking it also increases the risk of them injuring humans			0
' the monkeys first learnt how to bathe when the small wooden inn at @entity183 opened to the public as a hot spa over one hundred years ago in 1884			0
tourists can still visit the spa today , and , if lucky , they may find a monkey bathing alongside them in the hot waters .			2
