by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity3 spacecraft orbiting above @entity7 is a satellite so powerful , it can identify the number of chickens , manhole covers and even parking spaces around the world			1
@entity17 's @entity16 spacecraft was launched into space from a military base in @entity20 on wednesday - and is so high - resolution , it can pick out objects as small as 1 foot ( 31cm )			1
the 18ft - long ( 5.4 metres ) , 8ft - wide ( 2.4 metres ) satellite should last for at least seven years , but experts claim the satellite could be functional for almost double that time			1
@entity16 is also designed to peer through fog and smoke to image @entity7 's surface in detail , using an on - board instrument called @entity32 - short for @entity33 , @entity34 , water vapor , @entity36 , @entity37			2
this will help the satellite get a sharp view of the ground even if there is a fire , dust clouds , soot and smog			0
it is powered by solar panels , which extend the length and width of the satellite to 19ft long and 23ft wide ( 5.8 by 7 metres ) , and it weighs 6,200 lbs ( 2,812 kg )			1
it will orbit at a distance of around 383 miles ( 617 km ) above @entity7 's surface , and take 97 minutes to make a single orbit			1
@entity3 is one of five @entity7 - observation satellites being used by @entity17			1
the others include @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , which each have a resolution of 1.6ft ( 46cm )			0
its @entity64 has a resolution of 2.1ft ( 65cm ) , and @entity67 can view objects at 2.6ft ( 82cm )			2
the 18ft - long ( 5.4 metres ) , 8ft - wide ( 2.4 metres ) satellite was launched into space on board an @entity73 rocket from @entity74 ( pictured ) on wednesday			1
it should last for at least seven years , but experts claim the satellite could be functional for almost double that time @entity16 ( pictured ) is designed to peer through fog and smoke to image @entity7 's surface in detail , using an on - board instrument called @entity32 - short for @entity33 , @entity34 , water vapor , @entity36 , @entity37			1
it can count the number of chickes , manhole covers , parking spaces and even monitor how healthy trees are the 18ft - long ( 5.4 metres ) , 8ft - wide ( 2.4 metres ) satellite should last for at least seven years , but experts claim the satellite could be functional for almost double that time			1
it is powered by solar panels , which extend the length and width of the satellite to 19ft long and 23ft wide ( 5.8 by 7 metres )			2
@entity16 weighs 6,200 lbs ( 2,812 kg )			0
it will orbit at a distance of around 383 miles ( 617 km ) above @entity7 's surface , and take 97 minutes to make a single orbit			1
elsewhere , the satellite can send 1.2 gb of data back to @entity7 every second			1
the satellite can even monitor how healthy trees are , said @entity107 , @entity17 's director of next - generation products			2
‘ we can tell you , for each individual tree , how healthy it is			0
’ ‘ and potentially there are models that can estimate the yield of each individual tree			0
that 's the power of information we are bringing to the table with @entity16			0
’ the commercial satellite was launched on board an @entity73 rocket from @entity74			2
the $ 500million ( £ 299 million ) project is a collaboration between @entity124 - based @entity17 , and @entity126 - based @entity125			0
@entity127 and the @entity128 are also partners			0
in june , @entity17 was given permission from the @entity131 @entity130 to collect and sell imagery at the best available resolutions			0
@entity16 is one of five @entity7 - observation satellites being used by @entity137 others include @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , which each have a resolution of 1.6ft ( 46cm )			2
this image of the @entity140 in @entity141 was captured by @entity142 in june , @entity17 was given permission by the @entity131 @entity130 to collect and sell imagery at the best available resolutions			0
six months after @entity144 is operational , @entity17 will be allowed to sell imagery at up to 10 inches ( 25cm )			0
@entity148 's @entity147 plant is pictured , captured by @entity142 additionally , six months after @entity144 is operational , @entity17 will be permitted to sell imagery at up to 10 inches ( 25cm )			0
these include images for @entity151 , the government and other national and security agencies			0
elsewhere , the satellite can send 1.2 gb of data back to @entity7 every second			1
remote thruster and instrument checks will be carried out over the next month , and a data - certification process will follow to make sure the images are clear enough .			2

@entity3 - 3 spacecraft identifies objects as small as one foot ( 31cm )
it launched into space from a military base in @entity20 on wednesday
high - resolution satellite can count the number of chickens , manhole covers , and parking spaces around the world , for example
it can also send 1.2 gb of data back to @entity7 every second
at an orbit of 383 miles ( 617 km ) , it can see home plates in *stadiums*
the 18ft - long ( 5.4 metres ) , 8ft - wide ( 2.4 metres ) satellite should last for seven years - but is *expected* to orbit for much longer
