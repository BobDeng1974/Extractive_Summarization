by @entity0 last updated at 9:36 am on 5th march 2012 the ex-wife of @entity3 guitarist @entity2 has been enjoying a passionate relationship with the builder she employed to carry out renovation work on her £ 3 million @entity8 townhouse			1
former model @entity9 , 56 , who has previously spoken of her delight that there were ‘ hunky builders ’ working on the property , began dating divorced father - of - four @entity15 after a @entity17 party in december			1
he has spent several nights sleeping at the house , and was seen last week on the front steps in an affectionate embrace with @entity0			1
dismay : @entity22 , left , has told of her devastation after her fiance , @entity15 , began a relationship with @entity9 , ex-wife of @entity3 @entity2 , after working on her @entity8 home but the news has been met with dismay by his devastated fiancee			1
a spokesman for @entity0 has insisted she did not know that mr @entity15 already had a girlfriend			1
but @entity22 says his affair with @entity0 has ended her 22 - year relationship with the man she describes as the love of her life			1
miss @entity22 has watched as mr @entity15 was gradually seduced by the high life			1
@entity0 spent 23 years married to one of the world ’s most famous rock stars and bought the mansion in the celebrity enclave of @entity44 with the proceeds from her £ 6.5 million divorce last summer			1
in stark contrast , mr @entity15 , 48 , from @entity47 , @entity8 , runs his own building company with his son , rides a @entity52 motorbike and enjoys nights in front of the television watching @entity58 dramas @entity56 and @entity59			1
but after he began working at the @entity44 property in july 2011 , miss @entity22 says he began jogging , bought new clothes and cut out bread from his diet in order to make an impression on @entity0			1
he even started buying organic crackers			2
it was only after he failed to return home after attending the @entity17 party @entity0 held for her organic beauty range that he confessed to their affair			1
recently he has been using @entity74 as a shoulder to cry on , having grown tired of @entity0 ’s habit of name - dropping and insistence on attending @entity79			1
split : mr @entity15 with miss @entity22 last year			2
the pair had been together for 22 years and engaged for the past 2 years speaking to @entity82 , miss @entity22 said : ‘ that life is n’t us			2
we ’re ordinary people – we ’re not rock stars			2
if you do n’t like name - droppers do n’t go out with a rock star ’s ex-wife			2
he ’s tried it with @entity0 but he does n’t like it			1
‘ what we had was a real love story throughout my grown - up life and i ’m very sad that it ’s over			2
’ miss @entity22 , a mother of two , and mr @entity15 had dated on and off for more than 20 years and when he proposed on christmas day 2010 , she was happy to accept			2
but the affair with @entity0 has brought the relationship to a sorry end			1
speaking of the time mr @entity15 began work for @entity0 last july , miss @entity22 said : ‘ when he met her , he said , “ she ’s an old woman			1
’ but @entity0 obviously thought differently			1
she told a newspaper she was enjoying having ‘ hunky builders ’ around and confessed : ‘ one day i just climbed up on the roof to hang out , i felt like i was having a @entity109 moment			2
’ @entity0 was having £ 20,000 chandeliers installed , a dressing room built and a polished concrete floor fitted in the designer kitchen			1
wallpaper with a skull and crossbones pattern was hung , and a new balcony in wrought iron was put up			2
‘ an £ 8,000 bath got chipped when they installed it but she told them not to worry about it , ’ said miss @entity22			2
‘ there was also a mirror she ’d designed which got chipped			2
she seemed really laid back			2
‘ everything was antique , gothic and black , the skirting boards and window frames			2
’ flirty : a photo of @entity0 reclining in her new bath which she texted to mr @entity15 @entity0 frequently called or texted mr @entity15 with further instructions and personal messages – sometimes late at night			1
miss @entity22 discovered them by checking his phone			2
‘ they would say , “ you ’re so fabulous @entity15 x ”			2
i thought , “ you ’re the builder			1
she ’s not supposed to be talking to you like that ”			2
’ mr @entity15 began shopping for clothes in @entity143 , where the stalls cater to a younger , fashionable crowd			2
he began cutting out bread and jogging before work			2
‘ the biggest shock came when he started bringing organic crackers home			1
it rang alarm bells , because i knew @entity0 was into all that stuff , ’ said miss @entity22			1
however , the relationship began in the most cliched way – at the @entity17 for @entity0 ’s organic beauty range , held at her son @entity157 in @entity158			1
mr @entity15 did not return home that night			1
miss @entity22 said : ‘ i was so gutted			0
i wrote , “ i hope you do n’t mind but i ’m @entity15 ’s girlfriend			0
i know you were with him last night but he did n’t come home and i ’m worried ”			1
he rang me back a couple of minutes later			0
’ rough around the edges : mr @entity15 pictured hard at work outside @entity0 's luxury home in the upmarket district of @entity44 mr @entity15 confessed to sleeping with @entity0 , but called it a ‘ fling ’			1
‘ he asked me to hang around to see what happened , ’ said miss @entity22			0
‘ because we ’ve always had this easy relationship over the years that ’s what he expected			0
but i ’d reached this stage of my life where i did n’t want that any more			0
i wanted to be with him			0
’ @entity0 spent @entity17 in @entity178 but sent mr @entity15 regular affectionate text messages			1
when she returned during the last weekend in january , he disappeared off to see her – and miss @entity22 packed his bag			0
‘ it was so painful , ’ she said			0
‘ he was telling everyone she wanted him to move in permanently			0
’ such was miss @entity22 ’s affection for mr @entity15 that she allowed him to sleep at the house a couple of nights a week			0
but when they spoke it was so he could grumble			0
miss @entity22 said : ‘ they ’d be watching telly and @entity190 would come on and @entity15 would say , “ i like him ” , and she ’d say , “ i ’ve had lunch with him ”			0
‘ when he said he was missing his friends , she said , “ so am @entity195 and @entity196 [ @entity198 guitarist @entity197 and his wife ]			0
and [ rock guitarist ] @entity200 is a good friend too ”			0
he said that was what he had to put up with			0
‘ it was @entity79 and he said , “ she ’s gone to every single show			0
i ’m not into all that ”			0
he said she ’d go to the opening of an email			0
‘ he said , “ what am i going to do ? spend a months ’ wages on one meal ? ” ’ mr @entity15 told @entity74 he had spent @entity213 with @entity0 but later confessed : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s going to last			1
’ miss @entity22 said : ‘ i do n’t want them to split up			0
i do n’t want him to have ruined everything we had for something stupid			0
’ mr @entity15 confided that @entity0 ’s children were wary of him being around			1
@entity0 has one son , @entity221 , from her first marriage and two children , @entity224 , 32 , and @entity225 , 27 , from her relationship with @entity2			1
‘ he told me @entity0 had been on the phone to one of her sons and he ’d asked her who paid for dinner when they went out together , ’ said miss @entity22			1
mr @entity15 was seen arriving at the property on thursday on his motorbike			0
shortly after 5pm , a team of builders left in a van			0
he appeared at the door 20 minutes later , and @entity0 draped her arms around his shoulders in a loose embrace as they said goodbye			1
when asked about the affair , mr @entity15 said : ‘ i have nothing to say about that , that ’s nothing to do with me			0
’ last night , @entity0 said : ‘ s * * *			1
i did n’t really want this to come out			0
this is really going to b * * * * * everything up			0
i do n’t know if it ’s going to last			0
i wanted to keep it all quite secret until i knew where it was going			0
‘ i was in my marriage for a long time so i do n’t want to get really serious			0
i ’ve only really been going out on a couple of dates with him , it ’s nothing concrete			0
’ a representative for @entity0 added : ‘ @entity0 did n’t know @entity15 had a girlfriend			1
he said it was over			0
‘ she ’s just been having fun @entity262			0
she ’s been on dates with other guys and it was a bit of fun			0
‘ @entity15 ’s finished work on the house and is no longer in contact with @entity0			1
