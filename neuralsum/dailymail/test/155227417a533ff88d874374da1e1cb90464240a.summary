@entity0 , talksport lead football pundit who revels in laying down the law on the radio , astonished reporters with his behaviour during @entity6 ’s 3 - 3 @entity5 draw with @entity7 on tuesday night			1
@entity0 , despite sitting in the @entity9 press box where media impartiality is taken for granted , was jumping up and down during the game like the most fanatical @entity6 fan , celebrating the goals with the home supporters			1
he even greeted @entity7 ’s @entity15 falling down to win a free - kick by clearly shouting at him : ‘ you f * * * * * * rat			0
’ @entity19 pundit @entity0 was in full fan mode as he celebrated @entity6 's 3 - 3 draw with @entity7 the former @entity6 striker let loose with his wild , and sometimes expletive laden , comments from the press box @entity27 believed such actions in the supposed neutral sanctuary of the press box were permissible as he was n’t working for @entity19 during the match			1
he tweeted : ‘ with respect , on nights i go as a fan			0
i ’m not being paid to do anything other than be a fan			0
’ and @entity19 would not comment as they said @entity0 was n’t on duty , with reporter @entity37 giving his rather more impartial verdict for the station			2
however @entity0 did an interview with @entity41 and @entity42 on @entity19 before the match			2
@entity0 called @entity15 a ' f * * * * * g rat ' after he fell down to win a free - kick for @entity7 during the game @entity47 , @entity48 ’s highly - rated championship - winning coach also in charge of @entity51 team @entity50 , is hardly your archetypal red - meat - eating @entity52 fast bowler			1
@entity47 , who would be first choice for @entity56 as well if @entity57 fails in the @entity58 , is preparing for new season by becoming a vegan			1
meanwhile @entity63 ’s supporters ’ action group are questioning the value of having @entity66 commentator @entity65 on the club board after @entity68 , @entity63 ’s overseas signing , was selected for @entity71 ’s tours of the @entity58 and @entity56 , ruling him out of any county involvement			0
@entity48 's championship winning coach @entity47 is preparing for the season with a new diet bookmakers @entity78 , rabid publicists guaranteed to offend , have a new stunt showing @entity80 supposedly preparing for the @entity81 by jumping his horse over a speeding car			1
the @entity86 video is plainly mocked up but , with sensitivities around animal welfare , it was crass of @entity80 , jump racing ’s pre-eminent jockey after @entity93 ’s forthcoming retirement , to involve himself in such a provocative spoof — even if he is a @entity78 ambassador			1
@entity80 and horse clear a car , claimed to be travelling at 40mph , as part of the @entity81 countdown the split between @entity101 chairman @entity100 and vice-chairman @entity102 over homegrown players became very apparent during wednesday 's @entity101 council meeting			1
after @entity100 gave his well - received presentation , @entity107 director @entity106 , with his @entity5 hat on , told council that @entity100 should have said ‘ i ’ rather than ‘ we ’ as the issue had yet to be debated by the @entity101 board			2
@entity106 wants the consultation period to be a proper process starting at board level — during which no doubt the @entity5 will try to hijack it			0
so the big question is whether @entity100 is willing to use the rulebook to force it through			2
@entity101 chairman @entity100 still faces a challenge to convince everyone over plans to change homegrown quota @entity122 faces scrutiny @entity122 , @entity124 representative on daily @entity126 business for the club ’s @entity128 owners , likes to operate well away from the media spotlight			1
however @entity131 baseball shareholder @entity122 might soon have to explain his major involvement in a number of signings that have n’t worked out as well as current contract stand - offs if @entity126 ’s season were to further unravel			0
it ’s understood @entity122 ’s high opinion of @entity126 ’s pulling power and ability to keep players might have been swayed rather too much by their brief presence in the @entity143			0
@entity122 may have to explain why several signings , such as @entity145 , have not worked out @entity147 racing missing the start of an all - weather championship race at @entity150 last friday because of an ad break could come back to haunt them			2
@entity153 , the largest @entity154 racing group are understood to have paid for the tv production costs as part of the @entity150 promotion that attracted a 9,000 crowd			0
meanwhile @entity153 are looking to invite people supportive of their all - weather racing track at @entity161 for a celebratory launch when they receive the go - ahead for the plans discussed by the @entity166 board yesterday			0
however those in favour of the flat turf being dug up on the @entity161 mile are very hard to find .			0

@entity0 celebrated @entity6 's draw wildly from the press box
@entity48 championship winning coach @entity47 is going vegan
jockey @entity80 stars in new viral ad ahead of the @entity81
@entity100 and @entity102 are still at odds over homegrown players
