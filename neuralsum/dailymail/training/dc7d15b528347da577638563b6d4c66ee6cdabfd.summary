@entity0 is preparing to test its next - generation space telescope in a giant thermal vacuum chamber , with stunning photos revealing engineers hard at work ahead of testing of the @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
the historic chamber was once used to test manned spacecraft , but has now been refurbished for this larger and more sensitive piece of equipment			2
various components of the telescope are now being tested ahead of the planned launch in 2018 , when it will be used to study distant stars , galaxies and even exoplanets			0
@entity0 is preparing to cryogenically test its new telescope in a vacuum chamber ( shown ) in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the huge @entity23 at the @entity24 is being refurbished to accommodate the telescope the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) will be a large infrared telescope with a 6.5 - meter ( 21ft ) primary mirror			1
the project is working to a 2018 launch date			0
the @entity7 will be the premier observatory of the next decade , serving thousands of astronomers worldwide			0
it will study every phase in the history of our universe , ranging from the first luminous glows after the @entity37 , to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like @entity42 , to the evolution of our own solar system			0
the huge vacuum chamber in which part of the telescope is to be tested is called @entity23 and is located at @entity0 ’s @entity24 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
‘ this is what space science is all about , ’ said @entity0 photographer @entity49 , who captured a photo from outside the enormous mouth of the chamber			2
‘ there is nothing else like this that anyone will see in their day - to - day lives			0
’ engineers and technicians , dressed in sterile suits and secured by harnesses to stands for safety , are seen inside @entity23 preparing a lift system that will be used to hold the telescope during testing			1
once fully assembled and launched into space , the telescope will allow scientists to explore ever further into the cosmos , seeing things that even the mighty @entity76 ca n’t			0
before the telescope is launched one million miles ( 1.6 million km ) into space to its destination , it must undergo a series of detailed tests to ensure it 's ready for the harsh environment of space			0
this spring , a model of the telescope called @entity87 will begin cryogenic optical testing inside this chamber			1
‘ maintaining the schedule with a very large number of optical and ground support equipment integration efforts , while securing the telescope to a suspension system inside the chamber and conducting a cryo - strength test is an incredible integration and test challenge , ’ said @entity90 , manager for the @entity91 and @entity92 ( @entity93 )			2
this coming spring a test model called @entity87 will undergo cryogenic optical testing inside the chamber ( engineers seen at the mouth bottom left )			1
a suspension system ( right ) inside the chamber will hold the telescope in place as it is cryogenically tested the @entity7 is the scientific successor to @entity0 ’s @entity76			1
it will be the most powerful space telescope ever built , and is an international project led by @entity0 with its partners , @entity114 and the @entity115			2
@entity118 in december the @entity7 's @entity117 ( @entity92 ) structure endured a ' gravity sag test ' as it was rotated upside - down in what looked like a giant cube in a @entity0 clean room at the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125			1
the purpose of ' cubing ' the @entity92 was to test it for gravity sag , which is to see how much the structure changes under its own weight due to gravity			0
the @entity7 's @entity117 ( @entity92 ) structure recently endured a ' gravity sag test ' as it was rotated in what looked like giant cube in a @entity0 clean room ( pictured ) inside @entity0 's @entity123 's giant clean room in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity7 optical engineer @entity138 examines two test mirror segments recently placed on a black composite structure			1
this black composite structure is called the @entity7 's ' @entity87 ' and acts as a spine supporting the telescope 's primary mirror segments			1
the @entity87 is a non-flight prototype the @entity92 is one of three major elements that comprise the @entity151 flight system			0
the others are the @entity91 ( @entity153 ) and the @entity154 ( @entity155 and @entity156 )			0
engineers need to see how gravity affects the alignment of the instruments within the module when the @entity92 is in different orientations on the ground			0
they use measurements from this sag test to verify what the instrument alignments will really be in space , when there is no preferred direction from gravity , and take account of sag during assembly with the telescope			0
the cube with the @entity92 inside it was rotated using a massive machine called an @entity180 table ; the rotation was just the dramatic start to the test			2
the cube and @entity92 were then lifted off of the rotation table while inverted and kept upside down for several days while lasers made precise position measurements			0
the @entity187 of the @entity87 ( test ) telescope is shown here being stowed in the large cleanroom at @entity123			2
instrumentation will be added to the telescope arms to monitor temperatures during cryogenic testing in the @entity23 thermal vacuum facility at @entity24 in 2015			1

@entity0 is preparing to cryogenically test its new telescope in a vacuum chamber in @entity21 , @entity22
the huge @entity23 at the @entity24 is being refurbished to accommodate the telescope
this coming spring a test model called @entity87 will undergo cryogenic optical testing inside this chamber
*ultimately* it will be used to test various components of the @entity7
earlier this month one of its *crucial* components was spun in a cube to test its *resilience* to gravity
