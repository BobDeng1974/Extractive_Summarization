finally , down a quiet side street a few miles from my home , i found the address i was looking for			1
spiked metal gates protected a rather foreboding forecourt where a generously sized man was standing , shirtless and missing some teeth , hosing down an old red car			1
behind him were about 15 dust - covered other old vehicles , all sporting heavy - duty wheel clamps			1
among them was my trusty old @entity13			1
she paid £ 694 to get her impounded car back to cut a long story short : my car had been seized by a debt recovery agency following an unpaid ticket for a ‘ traffic offence ’ that had been issued by my local council			1
i was here to buy back my car from an auctioneer who had , in turn , purchased it from bailiffs			1
i only found out that my car was missing one saturday morning recently when i went to find it in the street outside my home in @entity16			1
it was n’t where i had left it			1
four of my neighbours have similar black @entity39			1
i could see theirs — but not mine			1
nor was there any sign — such as smashed glass on the kerb — to suggest it had been broken into and stolen			1
also , the car has an immobiliser and i had both the keys in my bag			1
suddenly i began to panic			2
had i driven it somewhere and forgotten where i had left it ? perhaps i ’d parked it in a neighbouring road and my mind was playing tricks			2
with a growing feeling of fury , i begrudgingly called 101 , the non-emergency police number to report my vehicle as stolen			2
this was the kind of hassle that has made me not very keen on cars			2
as a teenager , i was n’t much fussed about learning to drive			2
i figured , as a city - dweller , it ’s usually quicker , easier and less stressful to take public transport			2
but i then learned to drive in my mum ’s car			2
driving someone else ’s vehicle taught me to be careful and i ’ve i ’ve had no points on my licence and only one parking ticket in the ten or so years since passing my test			2
as i waited on the phone to be connected to the police , i thought through what life would be like without a car if mine never turned up			2
eighteen months earlier , @entity15 had performed an ' illegal manoeuvre ' by turning right where it was banned			1
her car was found outside her home by an @entity86 vehicle video courtesy of @entity88 certainly , i would save money , because motorists get fleeced			2
we all know driving is expensive — my council parking permit is more than £ 200 per year , then there ’s the car tax , insurance , petrol etc. at last , a police operator answered			1
having told him about my missing car , he asked : ‘ are there any parking restrictions on your road ? ’ i told him there are but that i had the correct permit , an @entity107 , full insurance and a valid tax disc			2
‘ oh , ’ said the operator , who , had checked my number - plate with the @entity113			2
‘ your car has been seized for an unpaid parking offence			2
i had n’t got any parking tickets — and if i had , i would have paid straight away			2
so i pressed a little further			2
it transpired that 18 months earlier ( in december 2013 ) , i ’d performed an ‘ illegal manoeuvre ’ on a road in nearby @entity120 , turning right where i was n’t supposed to			1
while i do n’t recall doing so , i did n’t doubt the police version of events			0
in any case , the incident had been caught on @entity126			0
it was , as they say , a fair cop			0
the operator said i had been sent notices of the ‘ penalty charge ’ which i had ignored			0
yet i had n’t received any at all			0
surely only police or councils should be allowed to have vehicle - recognition systems — not bailiffs			1
but even cowboy parking firms have access to @entity113 records eventually , i discovered what had happened			0
i moved house last year and despite changing the address details on my driving licence , insurance policy and council parking permit , i had n’t got my new address put on my car ’s registration document until may this year , when a cashier at the @entity150 who was sorting out my new car tax disc told me that i was legally bound to do so			0
apparently , under @entity152 , vehicle registration documents ( what used to be called log - books ) must contain the owner ’s up - to - date address			0
my failure to do so was an oversight , but naively , i ’d assumed that when you changed details on your driving licence with the @entity113 , they would automatically update all your details			0
but i was wrong , and thus all penalty notices about the traffic offences had been sent to my old address			0
the police operator told me this was now a ‘ civil matter ’ and the police would be unable to help me recover my car			0
he simply gave me the phone number for a debt recovery company called @entity177 let ’s just say that when i phoned them , the woman who answered did n’t sound like she was happy in her work			0
rude , obstreperous and obstructive , she told me that i must pay £ 694 to @entity177 if i wanted to get my car back , otherwise it would be sold at auction in a few days ’ time			1
i also discovered that two days earlier , while i was at work , an @entity86 vehicle ( to you and me a ‘ spy car ’ ) , owned by bailiffs and which has a computer linked to the council ’s database , had located my car outside my house			1
a tow - truck was summoned to remove my £ 7,000 @entity13 to take it to an auction firm to be sold			1
the @entity196 system cameras are used by police and councils , but are also used by bailiffs all because i had n’t paid a £ 130 traffic fine i knew nothing about			1
surely only police or councils should be allowed to have vehicle - recognition systems — not bailiffs			1
but i have subsequently learned that even cowboy parking firms have access to @entity113 records			0
i ’m not alone in thinking this is outrageous : the government has announced a proposal to ban private companies such as bailiffs from using this technology to recover unpaid traffic fines			1
indeed , the @entity216 and the @entity217 joined together to tackle what they called ‘ unacceptable parking fine collection practices ’			0
in any case , how difficult would it have been for my local council of @entity224 to track me down without using bailiffs ? while i was no longer at the address on my vehicle registration documents , the correct details were on my driving licence , insurance documents , @entity107 certificate , council parking permit and the electoral roll			1
all of this is computerised			0
cynically , i felt the council did n’t actually want to find me because otherwise they could n’t fleece me of such large sums of money ! anyway , back to mrs @entity238 at the bailiffs			1
she told me to call back on monday because the car pound was n’t open at weekends			0
so , on monday i called again			0
this time , i spoke with a fairly decent guy called @entity242			0
he said i had to pay the £ 694 to get my car back			1
i explained that i ’d had no notification about how these charges had accrued so asked for a breakdown of the costs			0
he said i had to apply in writing , but only after paying the fee			0
i was n’t even allowed to know which pound my car was in until i ’d paid , because , even though @entity242 was sure i would n’t , i might otherwise ‘ go down there and cause trouble without paying for the car ’			0
so i just had to pay some guy over the phone £ 694 — with nothing in writing to confirm the ‘ deal ’			1
to add insult to injury , when i asked for a receipt , i was told i did n’t need one			0
but i wanted one , i said			0
again , i ’d have to apply in writing			0
( i ’ve since had a receipt , but no breakdown of costs			0
) how do i complain , i asked ? you have to send an email and they will tell you how , he said			0
welcome to the @entity272 world of councils , bailiffs and traffic offences			1
after i ’d gone through this rigmarole , i had to wait an anxious hour — £ 694 poorer — for @entity177 to locate my vehicle and ring me back			1
which explains how i found myself outside @entity279 of @entity280 , @entity281 , a car auctioneers that specialise in selling repossessed vehicles			0
it was n’t their fault — they ’re just making a living			0
but i am incensed by @entity288 and the @entity289 who seem to be making obscene amounts of money out of the genuine mistakes of honest drivers			0
paying almost £ 700 to retrieve a car in which the driver had committed a £ 130 offence would be out of the reach of many people			1
while i accept i made two mistakes ( the illegal manoeuvre and not telling the @entity113 of my change of address so as to amend my car ’s log - book ) holding people such as me to ransom for minor misdemeanours — parking tickets , entering a bus lane , turning right at a no right turn — is criminal			1
the sooner this dubious practice of using spy cars is outlawed the better .			0

@entity15 , from @entity16 , did an ' illegal *manouevre* ' in december 2013
she was fined £ 130 for breaching no right turn but did not receive the letter
18 months later , her @entity13 was *unexpectedly* towed away by bailiffs
they had used an @entity324 camera to find her
