by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 30 july 2013 @entity2 ’s revolutionary new electric i3 car was unveiled to the world in @entity4 today , promising fun - filled green motoring at under 2p a mile			1
the new futuristic - looking green city run - around , said to be one of the most important in the @entity10 company 's history , was revealed simultaneously in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity2 engineers said that a full battery charge from empty will cost about £ 2 and will take it up to 100 miles			1
the fuel economy is equivalent to a conventionally - fuelled car doing around 425 miles to the gallon , they added , while a partially charged battery on an overnight charge will cost only 1.6p per mile			1
images of the full production - ready version of the electric super-mini leaked out early on the internet , sparking global interest			1
the event was streamed live on the internet at 1.15pm @entity4 time			1
first deliveries of the electric i3 will be in november priced from £ 25,680 - which includes a £ 5,000 taxpayer - funded ‘ green ’ subsidy courtesy of the @entity36			1
@entity2 is also introducing a ‘ range - extender ’ version at £ 28,830 , which features an additional 650cc two - cylinder petrol engine to maintain the battery charge and extend the range to between 160 miles and 186miles on one tank of fuel			1
this version is aimed at people who suffer from ‘ range - anxiety ’ – a fear of being left stranded before reaching their destination - and has average emissions of just 13g/kilometre			0
@entity2 ’s global sales and marketing director dr @entity68 said : ’ the i3 has re-written the rule book			0
after 100 years of landlines the mobile telephone opened up so many opportunities and changed the face of the communications industry			0
' electric vehicles will do the same for individual mobility			0
the car has been around for 130 years and today marks a change in the future of mobility			1
one thing the i3 will share with every other @entity2 is sheer driving pleasure			0
’ the car can be connected wirelessly to the driver ’s smartphone so they can check the charge in the battery before and after a journey			2
an interior view of the i3 at the @entity11 launch today			1
an app connected to a driver 's smartphone will let them know how much battery is left and send them in the direction of a charging point if needed the electric vehicle was simultaneously revealed to audiences in @entity12 , pictured , and @entity13 while the main event took place in @entity11 leaked : pictures of the @entity2 i3 have emerged on the internet ahead of its official launch as it is driven around , the i3 also keeps the driver in touch with traffic conditions , telling him or her where to park , find a charging point and even when the next train is leaving if you are heading out of town into the countryside			1
a phone app will let drivers know at any time where they have parked their car – or guide them on foot to their final destination after they park up			2
a ' driving range assistant ' linked to the car 's sat - nav will look at the battery 's charge and work out whether the destination is too far for the vehicle to go			1
if so , the assistant can suggest switching to a more economical driving mode or direct the driver to a public charging station			0
it even takes account of traffic jams , uphill climbs , and stop - start conditions ‘ to make allowances for the energy required			0
’ innovation : the @entity10 company is hoping its new electric car will be a breakthrough for the industry the new car 's clamshell doors open outwards to expose a futuristic interior , with hi - tech screens replacing many conventional dials also , to save energy , the electric motor switches from ‘ drive ’ to ‘ generator mode once the driver takes his foot off the accelerator , feeding power into the lithium ion battery and helping the car ‘ brake itself ’			1
@entity2 said : ’ this recharging effect is speed sensitive which means the car ‘ coasts ’ with maximum efficiency at high speeds and generates strong braking effect at low speeds			2
’ it noted : ‘ thinking ahead in city traffic can allow the driver to carry out 75 per cent of braking manoeuvres without applying the brake pedal			0
’ the i3 is rear - wheel drive powered by a 168bhp electric motor , and weighs less than 1,200kg thanks to a lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre - reinforced plastic and aluminium construction			0
it has a range of around 80 to 100 miles and can accelerate from rest to 62mph in just 7.2 seconds with a top speed of 93mph			0
the battery can re-charge 80 per cent of its power within three hours			0
@entity192 : traditional dials have been replaced by digital screens inside the i3 , according to pictures coming soon : the car will be launched on monday in three ' mega-cities ' - @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 difficulties : many customers are put off electric cars by the scarcity of charging points for them the @entity4 capital was chosen for the world premiere because of its trendy image and promotion of low - polluting cars which are exempt from @entity11 ’s controversial @entity210			1
transport secretary @entity211 is set to get a personal view of the car tomorrow			2
he said : ‘ it is fantastic to see a great brand like @entity2 introducing such a striking electric vehicle to the mainstream market			2

the i3 is built in @entity232 in @entity233 , where new production processes means the plant uses less energy , less water and produces less noise			0

the i3 is rear - wheel drive powered by a 168bhp electric motor , and weighs less than 1,200kg thanks to a lightweight but super-strong carbon fibre - reinforced plastic and aluminium construction growth in electric car use has been hampered by too few public charging points and exacerbated by a phenomenon known as ‘ range anxiety ’ – a fear by motorists that their batteries will run out of juice and leave them stranded			2
chargemaster was set up by @entity339 , the entrepreneur who made his first fortune from the creation of the @entity343 satellite navigation system , who owns 50 per cent of the company			0
