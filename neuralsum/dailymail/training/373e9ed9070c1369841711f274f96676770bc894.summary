the highly - trained police officers were more concerned about the contents of the @entity3 ' backpack than his firearm when they stormed the @entity6 cafe in the chilling final seconds of the @entity8 siege			1
the six @entity10 officers were ordered to enter the @entity12 building immediately after cafe manager @entity13 was shot in the head by the gunman , reports the @entity16			1
the crucial movements of the @entity10 officers have been praised as ' text book entry ' by those within the police force , as the specially - trained squad displayed a calm and composed nature despite their suspicions that @entity3 was strapped with an explosive			1
' the team who went through the doors still thought there were bombs ( inside )			0
they were more worried about the backpack than the gun			0
' ' they were confronted by a man with what they think is a bomb strapped to him and firing a gun at them as they ’re going in			2
' once @entity3 was killed , the next concern for the officers was getting the remainder of the female hostages out of the building as safely as possible			2
it was only then that the officers had time to think about themselves and fled the cafe as the contents of the backpack attached to the gunman 's back were still unknown			1
@entity67 then entered the building and discovered that despite wires hanging out of @entity3 ' backpack - it did not contain explosives			2
instead , he claimed @entity3 ( pictured ) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children meanwhile , tapes of the man responsible for the @entity12 terror plot delivering religious rants , saying ' society should behave in an @entity83 manner ' , have been unearthed			1
in 2009 , the self - styled sheik - five years before he carried out the 16 - hour attack where he held 18 people hostage in @entity12 's @entity87 in @entity8 's @entity88 last month - imparted his extremist views to a crowd inside a prayer hall in the city 's western suburbs			1
the december siege , which shocked @entity95 and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation , ended with the deaths of cafe manager @entity13 and mother - of - three @entity101 - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers @entity104			1
the footage , translated by a @entity107 translator for @entity16 , slammed overseas government who experienced the most violent of crimes , saying : ' your intelligence service is not working properly '			0
he believed governments who were ' not aware that there [ was ] criminal activity happening in your country ' then officials should resign from their positions as they were ' incompetent '			0
at times , @entity3 became so passionate he was seen thumping his fists to drive home his message			2
showing his level of paranoia , the terrorist also warned one of the biggest threats against fundamentalist @entity130 lay within their community			0
@entity3 and two of his hostages , @entity13 and @entity101 , were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of december 16 @entity3 believed moderate @entity130 would spell the death of extremists			1
canvassing what he thought was the virtues of @entity142 law , he pushed the case for @entity95 to take on more of the @entity83 culture			2
' the core of an @entity83 society is justice , social justice			2
@entity81 should behave in an @entity83 manner and there should be justice , ' he said			1
in the same year he fell off the radar of intelligence agencies , @entity3 warned about keeping an eye on ' friends ' who assimilated into the community before delivering terror			0
' an enemy would bluntly claim that they are the enemy			0
an ignorant friend claims that they are friends and they approach you , you would socialise with them and associate with them , but one day like a bear , they lift a big stone and they hit it to the face of that person and kills him , ' he said			0
@entity3 went on to say people should fear the ones who declared ' @entity83 is in jeopardy '			1
adding to the terrifying picture that has been pieced together of @entity3 over the past couple of weeks following the siege , friends of the gunman said he was an enigma who set up political party @entity180 and funded a @entity182 warehouse to be turned into a prayer hall			2
@entity184 ( pictured ) , who was assisted by @entity3 in 2007 when he sought @entity186 's seat in @entity8 's western suburb of @entity188 , said he knew man @entity189 ' very well ' and insisted that the @entity8 siege gunman was ' not violent ' refugee advocate @entity191 told @entity192 he did not know where @entity3 ' money was sourced and the terrorist was ' mysterious '			1
mr @entity191 added the gunman was good at networking from both sides of the @entity199 and @entity200 , saying ' he knew a lot about everybody , they knew nothing about him '			0
the advocate said @entity3 worshiped at different mosques around @entity8 , which included @entity207 's @entity206 , in @entity8 's west - a location where these religious rants were given			1
the way @entity3 spoke was described as ' slow ' and ' low - pitched '			0
mr @entity191 said the gunman was a ' very good listener ' who ' was n't stupid , he 's intelligent '			2
it comes after former failed politician and @entity215 detainee , who previously employed gunman @entity3 , claimed he could have convinced the 50 - year - old to end the @entity8 siege without resorting to violence			1
his offer was one of many put forward by other @entity199 community members , including the @entity222 , @entity223 ( pictured )			0
all of these are believed to have been rejected @entity184 , who was assisted by @entity3 in 2007 when he sought @entity186 's seat in @entity8 's western suburb of @entity188 , told @entity227 he knew him ' very well ' and insisted that @entity3 was ' not violent '			1
despite this show of support , @entity3 will be buried in an undisclosed location in @entity231 after the @entity232 reportedly refused to bury him			0
the wrongly accused former @entity215 detainee , who was tortured after being arrested in @entity234 under the false pretences he had knowledge of the september 11 attacks , claimed @entity3 was only seeking attention			0
mr @entity184 offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege , and maintains that @entity3 , while ' sick and disturbed ' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children			1
he insistently told @entity227 he believed @entity3 had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the @entity248 in @entity12 on december 15 , nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the @entity252			1
his offer of help police negotiate with the 50 - year - old was one of many put forward by other @entity199 community members , including the @entity222 , @entity223			0
all of these are believed to have been rejected			0
meanwhile , @entity3 ' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances , and will be buried somewhere in @entity231 within the next few days , according to the @entity16			0
it follows claims from the @entity232 no @entity199 funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed , days after the siege had ended			0
an islamic state propaganda magazine lavished @entity3 ' with praise for the siege , labelling the hostage crisis a ' daring raid ' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in @entity95			2
