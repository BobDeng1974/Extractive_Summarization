by @entity0 two @entity2 surfers have conquered one of the world 's biggest and most dangerous waves off the @entity7 coast at the same time - and captured the whole thing on camera			1
as if surfing the wave was not a big enough task , fromer pro surfer @entity12 , 31 , and current pro @entity13 , 36 , wanted to push surf photography to its limits by shooting the most dangerous image ever taken			1
towed by a jet ski , the pair dropped into the wave known as @entity20 together on friday , august 1 , reported @entity21			2
in the video posted on @entity41 , it states a photo of a wave of @entity20 's magnitude has never been attempted			2
the footage shows the men surfing the infamous wave 's gigantic barrel before crashing down and wiping both men out			0
from @entity12 ' hand - held camera , he was able to catch a bird 's eye view from inside the barrel as it began collapsing and swallowing @entity13			0
inside the barrel , @entity26 used a held - hand camera to capture @entity25 surfing the wave to get to the gigantic wave , the men were towed by jet ski with the ferocity of the beastly wave evident from the footage , @entity20 is reportedly the last wave in the world that has not be paddled by a surfer and produces more two or three - wave hold downs than any other , which can be deadly			0
a wave hold down is when a surfer is held under water by two or three successive waves breaking over them			0
despite the risks , because of @entity20 's massive barrel , it is ideal for surf photography because it can easily fit two surfers inside it			1
during filming , @entity26 was wiped out and suffered a gash to his face and ruptured eardrum the @entity20 is capable of producing three - wave hold downs , which keep surfers under water as successive waves break over them in their pursuit for the perfect shot , both surfers encountered the wrath of the wave , with @entity12 being dumped and suffering a ruptured eardrum and cut to his face			1
while @entity12 had previously surfed the wave , @entity13 had not			0
a full story of the surfer 's exploits at @entity20 will air in a mini-documentary on @entity99 and @entity100 later this month			0
