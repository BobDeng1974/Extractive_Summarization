@entity0 has told @entity2 chief @entity1 that the @entity4 people want migration from @entity6 ‘ fixed ’ – and he promised detailed proposals by @entity8 on how he will do it			1
the prime minister hit back at mr @entity1 , who declared on a visit to @entity12 that curbs on migrants from the @entity15 would be ‘ illegal ’ and @entity4 would be left with not even ‘ marginal influence ’ in the world if it left the @entity2			1
mr @entity0 said @entity4 voters – not the head of the @entity20 – were ‘ the boss ’ , insisting reform of the right to free movement would be central to demands for a looser relationship with @entity26 if he wins the next election			1
the @entity39 revealed last month that cabinet ministers are examining the idea of an ‘ emergency brake ’ which could be applied to limit numbers if migration exceeded forecasts			0
yesterday there were claims ministers also want to draw on current practice in @entity49 , the latest country to join the @entity2			1
@entity4 workers wanting to live and work there for more than three months need a work permit , only issued with proof of accommodation , financial means of support , health insurance and a criminal background check			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ what we need in @entity4 is a renegotiation of our relationship with the @entity2 and a referendum where the @entity4 people decide whether to stay in this reformed organisation or do we leave it			1
clashes : the @entity2 chief had said proposed @entity4 curbs on migrants from the continent would be illegal ‘ now that ’s what i will pursue , that ’s what i will deliver and at the heart of that renegotiation we need to address people ’s concerns about immigration			1
' i ’m very clear about who the boss is , about who i answer to and it is the @entity4 people			1
they want this , they ’re not being unreasonable about it			0
’ but deputy prime minister @entity91 claimed mr @entity1 was right to warn that @entity4 would be marginalised on the world stage if it quits the @entity2			1
he said : ‘ just ask yourself this – do you really think that people in @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity95 are going to take @entity4 seriously in the future if we do n’t stand tall in @entity26 , @entity101 and @entity102 ? @entity103 has appointed one of @entity106 ’s few remaining blairite mps as shadow @entity6 minister			1
in a mini reshuffle prompted by the resignation of @entity112 over @entity106 ’s support for airstrikes in @entity115 , former business minister @entity109 was promoted			0
he is an arch - supporter of @entity116 and is likely to sharpen @entity106 ’s position on @entity2 reform			1
‘ i just think bobbing around rather hopelessly in the mid-atlantic , and having lots of major foreign investors pulling out of this country jeopardising millions of jobs … i do n’t think is a way of making this country stronger and safer and more prosperous in the future			0
’ mr @entity1 , who steps down from his post at the end of the month , warned @entity4 would struggle to have even ‘ marginal influence ’ in the world outside the @entity2			1
it came as @entity132 unveiled proposed legislation which could mean @entity2 migrants being refused entry if their ‘ personal behaviour ’ is considered a threat to ‘ security or public order ’			1
will the options work ? analysis by @entity142 @entity0 ’s immigration proposals are on hold until december			0
home affairs editor @entity142 looks at his options and whether they will work			0
an ' emergency brake ' controls would be imposed on @entity2 migrants if the number of new arrivals have a ‘ destabilising ’ effect on the economy or public services			1
the measure would be strictly temporary – leaving mr @entity0 open to criticism he has not regained control of @entity4 ’s borders			2
there are precedents for short - term suspensions of free movement			0
the @entity163 think - tank says member states with high levels of immigration could support mr @entity0 to help him secure a @entity168 vote in an @entity2 referendum			1
quotas or a limit on @entity172 only a fixed number of @entity2 nationals allowed in each year			2
one method would see a time limit placed on @entity172 numbers – preventing people from working or claiming benefits indefinitely			0
this could prove a bureaucratic nightmare and it is unclear how the @entity183 would be able to remove those without permission to be here			0
achievable ? almost certainly not			0
it is illegal under existing treaties and other states would be highly unlikely to negotiate , having voted against a @entity190 quota plan			0
mr @entity0 would have to threaten to leave the @entity2 and hope countries such as @entity192 preferred some of its countrymen being guaranteed entry , rather than none if @entity4 quit			1
making a stand : does enough political will exist to defy @entity26 over immigration laws ? ( file photo ) a points system @entity2 workers would only be allowed in if their skills are needed			2
to appease @entity26 , the threshold could be set lower for @entity2 nationals than @entity207 worker			2
achievable ? no. it would involve ripping up treaties and there is no appetite to even consider the idea among @entity2 members			2
benefits restrictions mr @entity0 has already tightened access to unemployment benefits			0
he could augment this with controls on benefits which top - up wages			0
this would reduce a major pull factor for families from countries such as @entity225 and @entity226 , where wages are low			0
many member states share @entity4 ’s concerns and would like to re-take control of their own benefit systems			2
make a stand and defy brussels unilaterally re-impose border controls on @entity2 nationals without bothering to first renegotiate the existing treaties			2
achievable ? yes – if the political will exists			0
@entity4 would be hauled to the @entity238 but some @entity33 believe that , prior to an election , this could be hugely popular			2
quit the @entity2 the @entity241 position is that nothing short of full withdrawal will give back border control			1
achievable ? yes , though it would require the support of the public in a referendum			0
mr @entity0 ’s critics say that , unless he at least threatens to leave , he should expect to achieve nothing in negotiations .			0
