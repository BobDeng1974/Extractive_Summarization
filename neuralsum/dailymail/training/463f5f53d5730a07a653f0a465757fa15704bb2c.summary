by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:59 pm on 18th december 2011 @entity3 mayor @entity2 said @entity5 leaders should abandon ' hysterical ' efforts to rescue the eurozone and recognise that some countries have to drop the single currency			1
' i would be amazed if we were all sitting here next year and the euro had not undergone some sort of change , ' he told @entity17 ’s @entity16			2
' i think it highly likely that there will be a realignment in the sense that some countries will fall out ... and we all know who the likely candidates are			2
three wise men : @entity3 mayor @entity2 ( left ) appeared on the @entity16 show alongside @entity26 ( centre ) and business secretary @entity28 ( right ) ' but there is such phobia about this and such a lot of political ego has been invested in the success of the euro project that people are failing to see that might be the best way forward			0
' if we continually go on with these hysterical attempts to bubble gum the whole thing together we are just going to consign those periphery economies particularly to low growth and we are never going to get confidence back in the eurozone			1
' the senior @entity46 played down calls for an immediate referendum on @entity50 membership of the @entity51 - saying it would be required if there was a ' treaty change that substantially affects the @entity50 '			0
' there is no immediate reason as far as i can see to get embroiled in an in / out referendum , ' he added			0
interviewing @entity59 business secretary @entity28 , mr @entity16 asked : ' even @entity2 conceded or suggested that the use of the @entity50 veto , which he was in favour of ... had n’t actually put the @entity63 in a stronger position , or @entity50 financial services in a more protected position , is that what you think too ? ' mr @entity28 replied : ' that ’s correct and @entity2 was right , as a matter of fact the position is unchanged			2
warning : @entity74 's prime minister ' @entity76 ' @entity75 ( left ) has been told @entity74 could be hit with a credit downgrade in the near future , as @entity80 president @entity79 ( right ) was warned @entity80 could lose its aaa - rating ' it was largely political , certainly the prime minister has got a short - term boost from it , but it does n’t actually deal with the big long - term fundamental problems in @entity5			1
' asked if he contemplated resignation at any time during the crisis over the @entity51 veto , mr @entity28 said ' no '			2
he added : ' i frequently wonder about my position in @entity92 because we ’re all making difficult decisions , but when i reflect on it as i do , i realise that what we ’re committed to is actually making this @entity92 work , we ’ve got to deal with the very serious problems in the economy			0
' the comments came as @entity102 's hardline stance over the eurozone treaty appeared to have secured a significant boost in public opinion - as the @entity106 opened up a six - point poll lead over @entity108			1
a survey , conducted as the political fallout from his use of the @entity50 ’s veto at the @entity115 summit convulsed the coalition , put the premier 's party up two points with @entity108 dropping the same amount			1
the 40 per cent to 34 per cent gap is among the biggest since the immediate aftermath of the 2010 general election and marks the highest @entity46 approval rating for more than 18 months			2
warning : rating agency @entity125 has told the @entity126 to take a more active ' firefighting role ' the @entity59 , whose mps abstained en masse in protest at what they saw as a damaging outcome to single currency crisis talks , were unchanged on 14 per cent in the @entity136 / sunday @entity135 poll			1
it also suggested mr @entity102 could face growing demands for a referendum on the @entity51 following his dramatic withdrawal from the deal agreed by most of the other member states last week			0
a 58 per cent majority of those polled backed the move , with more than one in three ( 35 per cent ) wanting a vote within a year			0
as credit ratings agencies cast fresh doubt on efforts to end the euro crisis , it was reported that evacuating expats formed part of emergency plans being drawn up by the @entity156			1
the @entity157 said officials were concerned that around a million @entity50 living in @entity159 and @entity160 could be trapped without access to cash if banks in the eurozone countries collapsed			1
preparing : @entity165 is getting ready to launch a fresh dig at @entity46 eurosceptics it quoted officials saying the worst case scenario was being prepared for - with possible transport routes out and emergency loans among measures being examined			0
a spokeswoman said : ' officials continue to contingency plan for a range of possible scenarios			0
' it came as deputy prime minister @entity165 prepared to launch a fresh dig at @entity46 eurosceptics - criticising the influence of ' narrow nationalism ' over ' enlightened internationalism '			0
the @entity59 leader will take to the tv studios for the second weekend in a row today as he battles to assert his party ’s position after the difficulties caused by the euro row			0
yesterday he urged eurosceptics not to exploit the eurozone crisis to foster ' xenophobia , chauvinism and polarisation ' as fresh doubts were cast on efforts to save the single currency			1
credit rating agency @entity125 said it believed that a comprehensive solution was now ' technically and politically beyond reach ' despite last week ’s agreement on a rescue package			1
@entity46 former chancellor @entity202 warned that time was running out to develop sufficiently strong measures to prevent the euro from a fatal ' explosion '			0
in moves that will be closely watched by markets , @entity125 put the ratings of six countries - @entity210 , @entity159 , @entity211 , @entity74 , @entity212 and @entity213 - under review			1
it also dropped @entity80 's economic outlook from stable to negative - meaning it believes the country is more likely than not to lose its cherished @entity219 credit rating within two years			1
@entity220 was delivered a diplomatic slap by the deputy prime minister on friday for ' simply unacceptable ' attacks on the @entity50 economy by a series of senior politicians and officials			0
its prime minister and central bank chief were among figures publicly suggesting the @entity50 was a better candidate for any downgrade of its credit rating			1
mr @entity165 has welcomed what he said were encouraging steps towards ensuring the @entity50 was not isolated in @entity5 , including an agreement that @entity50 officials will take part in ' technical discussions ' over the formation of the new rules on debt and deficit limits and a softening of opposition to the use of @entity51 institutions in developing them			2
the @entity251 will enforce what are meant to be strict central controls on the economies of participating member states			2
@entity256 and the @entity257 have said they will not join the new agreement unless plans for tax harmonisation were dropped as signs of cracks among the other 26 nations appeared			0
@entity136 interviewed a random sample of 1,008 adults by telephone on december 14 - 15 and the results were weighted to the profile of all adults			0
