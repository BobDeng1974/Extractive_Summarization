' @entity130 , a @entity2 human rights expert for the pro-democracy @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , was unsurprised by the image			2
she said : ' i think that we have a lot of people hoping that because @entity15 walks around without a tie on and his wife is a singer who travels with him on trips that maybe we 're dealing with a new kind of leader , but i think these images remind people that this is the same party			0
' it 's using some new tools and new techniques , for the same purposes : to preserve its own power			0
