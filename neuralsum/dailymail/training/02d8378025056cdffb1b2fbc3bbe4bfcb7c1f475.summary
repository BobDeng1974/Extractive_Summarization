former @entity7 player @entity35 even said : “ the only bad part is i know how much his wife loves the team and mostly i feel sad for her			0
’ but @entity9 says that no one should have sympathy for @entity2 ; she ’s just as bad as her husband			1
the 37 - year - old @entity9 , who has known @entity2 all her life , says : ‘ she was very well aware of the racist issues			1
the fact that she ’s saying she was n’t is a lie			2
she ’s @entity3 ’s right hand man			1

i do n’t know why the @entity7 and manager are sticking up for her , i know @entity2			2
‘ she ’s totally a racist			1

‘ she ’s trying to come out of this whiter than white , but she ’s as dirty as him			2
it does n’t take a genius to work that out			0

i feel like we ’ve had duct tape on our mouths , we all feel we do n’t have to hide anymore			0
they ’ve manipulated and controlled our family			0
‘ my mom was scared , every time she gets scared , she calls @entity2 , which is the wrong thing to do			1

she ’s like a wicked mother			0
she ’s so much older than my mom , who looked up to her			0
‘ i ’m not happy that my mom is contacting her			0

she does n’t know any other way			0
‘ @entity2 ’s so selfish and a liar			1
she ’s been saying this stuff for years , that she ’ll take care of us			0
she said she ’d give me an apartment in @entity296 , why would you offer me this ? she offered me the apartment building during the time i was suing her family for putting me in a wheelchair			0
i just thought it was so bizarre , it did n’t make any sense to offer this on the side			0
