by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 06:57 est , 17 december 2012 engaged : @entity1 with @entity2 in 2009			1
he has announced he is marrying the tv presenter , who is 49 years his junior controversial former @entity5 prime minister @entity1 has announced his engagement to a girl old enough to be his granddaughter			1
twice - married @entity1 , 76 , today confirmed that his new partner was tv showgirl @entity2 , 27 , who has been at his side constantly in recent weeks since he announced he would be running in next february ’s general election			1
the cruise ship crooner turned politician made the revelation during a long and wide - ranging interview on one of his numerous tv stations - and it came despite the fact he is still officially tied to his second wife @entity19			1
@entity1 , who is currently on trial accused of having sex with an underage prostitute , said : ' it ’s official , i have got engaged to @entity2 and finally i feel less lonely			1
' there is a 49 year age difference between us			2
she is a beautiful girl on the outside and even more beautiful on the inside , of solid moral principles , she is very close to me , she loves me and i feel the same way			1
' she is a very good friend of my daughter @entity33			0
' in recent weeks the two have been seen together at the @entity35 in @entity36 watching his @entity36 football team and they were also snapped laughing and joking at a pizzeria in the city centre			0
the two have been linked before and she has been seen driving into his apartment in @entity44			0
she is a former councillor in @entity45 with his @entity46			0
miss @entity2 has strongly defended @entity1 in the past and cooed how she loved his ideas in interviews and is also famous for singing a song which includes the eye opening line of : ' if you pull your knickers down the ratings go up			1
' @entity1 also spoke of his ongoing trial which is centred on his infamous bunga bunga parties and again insisted nothing untoward took place at the evenings in his villa at @entity63 near @entity36			1
it was a particular moment for me , i had just announced my divorce , my mother and my sister had just died			0
' i would go home and there was no - one there , i felt sad			2
' @entity1 is alleged to have paid @entity79 belly dancer @entity78 for sex when she attended the parties as a 17 - year - old girl and dozens of other tv starlets were also said to have been given cash , jewellery and cars for turning up			1
the age of consent in @entity5 is 14 but paying a woman under the age of 18 is seen as prostitution with a minor and is punishable by up to three years in jail			2
@entity1 supported @entity2 as she ran for office in @entity45 in 2009 but @entity1 hit back at judges and prosecutors in @entity36 where the case is being heard , once again insisting they were politically led and out to get him			1
he said : ' i have fallen into their trap , it ’s been built up by the judiciary			0
the trial is just an incredible machination			0
' it was an excuse they needed to hit me with a massive defamation operation against me and my government which had international implications			2
' he added : ' in a twenty year political career you get used to all sorts of insults			0
but there is something that before @entity116 smells of a vendetta			0
' i have been convicted to four years in jail by a court in @entity36 who accused me of being behind a system that saved me three million euros a year but at the same time i paid 570million euros in taxes			0
' in a 120 - minute interview on his @entity126 station with host @entity127 , @entity1 also explained why he was running for prime minister a year after being forced out of office			1
he said : ' we are in the same situation as 1994 - if i do n’t run then the @entity132 will get in			0
we can not run the risk of them winning			0
' despite his boasts commentators see a win for @entity1 as unlikely given that his party is trailing third in the polls with around 20 % of the vote , with @entity132 leader @entity141 the favourite to win			2
@entity1 ’s appearance on the show unleashed a storm of protest on the internet , with many expressing anger at what they described as an ' obvious and concrete example of a conflict of interest			2
