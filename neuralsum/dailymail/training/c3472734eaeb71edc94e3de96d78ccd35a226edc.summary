the advisers , known in @entity4 as the ' wise men ' , predicted the economy would almost grind to a halt this year , growing just 0.3 per cent compared to 0.7 per cent in 2012			1

economic advisers to the @entity4 government , housed in the @entity20 , more than halved their forecast for 2013 growth foreign trade , traditionally the main driver of @entity4 growth , would subtract 0.3 percentage points from @entity4 gross domestic product ( gdp ) this year , the advisers said			1
demand for @entity4 's goods has weakened as austerity measures and recession take their toll on demand in other members of the euro zone , where @entity4 sends 40 per cent of its shipments			1
the advisers said investment was unlikely to make any significant contribution to growth in the first half of 2013			0
they see capital investment dropping by 3 per cent over the year , a slight improvement compared with 2012 , when firms invested 4.8 per cent less in machinery and equipment			1
some @entity4 companies are making cuts , with @entity48 , the country 's second biggest carrier , saying it would focus on savings this year			2
@entity51 has said it would reduce overall investment in the shortened 2013 year to below the 954 million euros it put into its business in the first nine months of 2012			2
the advisers said growth would primarily come from domestic demand , with private consumption increasing by 0.7 per cent and government spending rising by an upwardly revised 1.7 per cent			0

@entity48 , the country 's second biggest carrier , saying it would focus on savings this year in addition , inflation is moderate , wages are rising and paltry interest rates are giving consumers little incentive to save			0

the influential @entity83 survey last week showed @entity4 business morale fell in march , breaking a four - month run of gains and highlighting concerns the reignited debt crisis in the euro zone will test @entity4 's resilience			0
consumer price inflation will ease to 1.7 per cent this year from 2.0 per cent last year and the unemployment rate will edge up to 6.9 per cent from 6.8 per cent , the advisers said , which is still near post-reunification lows .			0
