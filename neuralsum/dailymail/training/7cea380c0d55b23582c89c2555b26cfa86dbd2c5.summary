@entity0 came to the rescue again for @entity2 with two super strikes but the draw left them eight points behind @entity7 leaders @entity8			1
@entity9 fired the home side ahead after having two efforts ruled out but @entity0 equalised despite hint of offside and handball in the build up			1
@entity16 went ahead again when @entity18 's cross was headed into his own net by @entity20 under pressure from @entity22 but @entity0 came to the rescue again with an 83rd minute equaliser			1
@entity26 's @entity25 was at @entity27 and rates all the players ' performances			2
city midfielder @entity31 blew hot and cold but set up @entity0 for his second goal @entity16 @entity34 caught well , made a few good saves and looked more assured than he has previously			1
6.5 @entity36 did n’t really have anyone to mark per se , which can be tricky for full backs			2
helped @entity40 down the right to good effect			0
7 @entity43 nothing he could have done about @entity0 ’s first half goal			1
often a spare man , he tracked the buzzing runs of @entity31 and @entity48			1
great header off the line late on			0
7 @entity51 brilliant early block to deny @entity48			1
even brought the ball out from the back on occasion			0
heroic display - and cleared off the line too			0
7.5 @entity57 had the beating of @entity59 and was vastly improved after a bad afternoon at @entity8 last weekend			1
7 @entity40 again asked to play out of possession on the right , but - just as at @entity62 - put in a decent shift			2
has quality on the ball			0
7 @entity16 striker @entity9 continued his rich vein of form with well - taken goal @entity69 lost the midfield battle with @entity71 , but did get himself on the ball and looked to make things happen			1
6 @entity74 spoiler , and a good one at that			0
@entity16 will need @entity74 firing if they are to stave off relegation			0
raises his game against the best			0
7 @entity81 an absolute waste on the left , but has become more rough and ready than he was at @entity84 last year			2
6.5 @entity16 midfielder @entity74 did a superb spoiling job in the centre of midfield @entity9 showing that he can really mix it in the top flight			1
took his goal well and was unfortunate not to add more			0
7.5 @entity22 gives @entity16 an added dimension			1
sometimes there is no shame in going a touch longer and @entity22 is the perfect battering ram			1
8 subs @entity100 ( for @entity69 , 46 mins ) sent on at half - time to do a job on @entity48 , who was substituted late on			2
good on the ball and made a terrific block in stoppage time			0
6.5 @entity0 saved @entity2 further embarrassment with two super strikes @entity2 @entity108 had an embarrassing moment in which he scuffed a free - kick he touched twice - prompting great debate over the laws of the game - but did make a collection of superb stops			1
7 @entity116 booked for deliberately tripping @entity81 after being bullied off the ball by the midfielder			2
did n’t track his runners , failed to win his headers and looked shaken all evening			0
4 @entity123 see @entity20 , but that bit worse			1
perhaps too soon to write the £ 32million man off - he is only 23 - but there is no doubt he is struggling			2
ca n’t even do the basics			0
3.5 @entity129 got forward well , although did afford @entity40 too much space on occasion			2
6 @entity71 mixed it well with the tenacity of @entity74 and @entity69			0
did the simple jobs well and allowed the flair players to do their thing			0
7 @entity137 made a ghastly error just before the break which presented @entity9 with a great chance but got hold of midfield			1
6.5 @entity48 flitted in and out , as @entity48 does tend to do			0
dangerous around the box but could n’t find a killer ball			0
6.5 @entity59 @entity146 - should have been the perfect evening for him on the break but never really got going			0
6.5 @entity31 sometimes breathtaking , but often frustrating			1
@entity31 ’s problems are amplified because of the quality you know he has in his locker , but a wonder ball for @entity0 ’s second equaliser			1
7 @entity0 he ’s just too good			1
give him a chance and @entity0 scores			1
it ’s 14 for the season now and his two touches in mid-air were superb to fashion the first			0
where would @entity2 be without him ? 9 subs @entity163 ( for @entity137 , 64 mins ) lasted just four minutes after picking up an injury			2
@entity165 ( for @entity163 , 68 mins ) never got going			0
6 @entity166 ( for @entity48 , 74 mins ) hit @entity36 flush in the face when presented with a glorious opportunity			0

@entity0 was man of the match with a rating of 9
@entity31 sometimes breathtaking , but often frustrating and scored 7
@entity20 ( 4 ) was *abysmal* and @entity123 ( 3.5 ) even worse
@entity9 ( 7.5 ) and @entity22 ( 8 ) were a *constant* menace
