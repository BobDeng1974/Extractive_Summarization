by @entity0 an @entity2 hospital paid £ 1,800 for an agency nurse to work a single shift at its accident and emergency unit			1
the huge amount was for 11 hours work – equivalent to a payment of just over £ 163 an hour			1
the £ 1,800 total is thought to be the highest figure ever paid for a nursing shift in the @entity2 , although the gap between rates for @entity2 staffers and agency locums at every level has been widening in recent years			1
an unidentified nurse was paid £ 1,800 for one shift at the @entity20 in @entity21 the extraordinary shift payment was made for a nurse covering the bank holiday on august 26 last year at the @entity20 and @entity25 in @entity21			1
one staff nurse at @entity20 , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ most of the nurses here struggle by on £ 25,000 a year or so			1
‘ that works out at about £ 90 - £ 100 a day , so when you see someone coming in and doing the same job as you and getting paid what you take home in a month in just one day it makes you sick to the stomach			2
’ a freedom of information request found the @entity39 paid out £ 4.7million to plug staff shortages between january and november last year , including £ 2.8million on agency nurses			1
other data suggests the total @entity2 bill for temporary nurses is set to reach £ 450million at the end of this financial year – a 21 per cent rise on 2011/12			1
at least one other trust , the @entity49 , paid almost £ 1,800 for a specialist nurse to work 13.5 hours in accident & emergency in december 2011			2
the @entity49 paid almost £ 1,800 for a specialist nurse to work 13.5 hours in accident & emergency in december 2011 @entity2 rates for staff filling a similar permanent post in @entity59 range between £ 25,528 and £ 34,189 a year			1
in most cases nurses are provided by private agencies , which normally take commission of at least 20 per cent			0
@entity66 , the chair of the @entity65 , admitted that there are some hospitals in @entity69 where you would not want to go as a patient such agencies usually pay hourly rates of between £ 25 and £ 40 to nursing staff , but have to find more to fill empty positions on bank holidays and meet unexpected surges in demand			2
agencies advertise their willingness to pay at least twice as much as full - timers receive for nurses doing shifts at short notice , and specialist skills attract higher rates			0
although @entity20 may have paid £ 1,800 to get the bank holiday shift covered , it does not mean that 80 per cent of the money automatically went to the nurse			1
the @entity90 said it is up to an agency to decide how much it agrees to pay an individual for working a shift and this may vary according to demand from its @entity96 are now more than 60 private firms providing nursing and medical staff to the @entity2			1
doctors can earn vast sums for shifts , with one agency doctor at @entity104 getting £ 5,700 for a day ’s work in 2010 and many consultants raking in around £ 3,200 for a single shift			2
bosses at the @entity20 and @entity25 said the amounts being paid were too high , but reflected the rate it had to pay to get workers to come in on public holidays			2
other costs at the trust include 21 agency doctors paid in excess of £ 1,000 per shift during 2013			1
a spokesman for the @entity39 said agency workers were drafted in at critical times , such as peaks in @entity59 use over bank holidays and staff sickness			0
a recent report by the @entity65 found that the trust had high use of temporary staff in the past , but that it was improving			0
the @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ we thoroughly agree that agency charges are too high and that is why we are proactively addressing this issue and have been totally transparent with the @entity65			0
‘ reducing agency use will involve international recruitment , and we need an adult debate about this while the training of more doctors and nurses nationally takes effect			2
’ there are some hospitals in @entity69 where you would not want to go as a patient , the head of the organisation which inspects them said yesterday			0
@entity65 chairman @entity66 said there was a postcode lottery in standards of care , adding : ‘ the quality of care in one hospital can be very different from the quality of care in another			0
’ he said @entity69 probably had some of the best - led and best - run hospitals in the world , but added : ‘ in those hospitals where you would not wish to go , you have a very poor damaged culture where employees feel they ca n’t raise concerns , where patients are not listened to			0
’ he said a number of hospital trusts had been identified as inadequate			0
‘ @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 is a good example , ’ he told the @entity167			0
‘ @entity172 and @entity173 would be another one			0
’ mr prior said many such hospitals were good in parts and added : ‘ the critical thing that determines whether a hospital is good , bad or indifferent is the quality of leadership			0
