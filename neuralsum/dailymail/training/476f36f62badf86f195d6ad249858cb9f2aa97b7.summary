by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:30 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:30 est , 31 december 2013 deep down , @entity3 will know it ’s going to be hard to avoid the whitewash now			1
they had a great chance to make it 3 - 1 in @entity7 , but it was almost as if they had forgotten how to win			1
when you ’re more than 100 ahead with all 10 wickets in hand , you have to think you ’re not going to lose from there			0
their confidence just seemed shot to pieces			0
it ’s amazing , really , when you think where they were a few months ago			2
@entity20 played an innings that was totally out of character , and @entity23 was just too tentative			0
you could see them waiting for something to change , but you have to make things changes yourself			0
people have been getting stuck into @entity29 ’s captaincy , and i agree that he has to think a bit more outside the box			1
but he ’s had a good bowling attack at his disposal for a while , and generally speaking that means you do n’t have to do anything fancy			0
despair : @entity29 's @entity3 team has forgotten how to win and missed a gold chance in @entity7 out of character : @entity20 was n't himself and @entity23 was too tentative in the @entity42 what he ’s discovering now is that victorious captains rarely get as much credit as they should , while defeated captains get all the flak			1
i do n’t buy into the argument that he ’s too nice to be a @entity42 captain - there ’s nothing wrong with being nice			2
but you ’ve just got to make sure you stay ahead of the game , and he ’s not been able to do that with this team			2
he ’s still young , this is his first series defeat out of six , and there are n’t too many others queuing up to replace him			0
let ’s give the guy a chance to turn things round			2
that said , a couple of things have surprised me			0
it was strange to see @entity68 retire in the middle of the series			1
i do n’t know how much his body is hurting him , but i thought he took a potshot or two at his team - mates , especially when he made the point that he could n’t be expected to bowl so many overs in the second innings with his elbow			0
to me , that sounded like he felt his batters were n’t giving him enough runs to defend or enough time to recover from the first innings			0
who knows , perhaps he was told that he would n’t be playing at the @entity7 and decided to get in there first			1
i felt that if @entity3 were going to get anything out of the series , their senior players had to stand up as a unit			1
i was also surprised by the decision to drop @entity93 , especially because @entity94 does n’t look like a long - term choice as wicketkeeper			1
why not allow prior to play until the end of the series , because i ca n’t see @entity94 keeping the gloves for @entity3 ’s first test next summer			1
strange call : @entity68 's retirement came at a curious time and he may have had a dig at his batsmen long - term : @entity93 should have seen out the series , as @entity94 does n't look permanent replacement the question @entity29 and the selectors will have to ask themselves now is whether they can get another couple of years out of the likes of @entity114 and @entity115 , because they ’ll want them for the 2015 ashes			1
the nucleus is certainly there			0
as for @entity122 , it ’s been a case of some outstanding individual performances from @entity125 and @entity126 , with good back - up from @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
their senior players have seized the moments , and they ’ve played good team cricket			0
it ’s going to be fascinating to see how they fare in @entity137 , who have just lost @entity139 and will start to find soon that life is less straightforward when some of your best players begin to call it a day			0
lethal : @entity125 has been a stand - out for @entity122 with 31 wickets in the series so far outstanding : @entity122 's pace spearhead @entity130 and keeper - batsman @entity126 have been stand - outs @entity3 have experienced that first hand on this tour , whereas @entity122 feel like a team on the way up ( as do @entity153 , who have some great young batters )			1
if @entity130 stays fit in @entity137 , where @entity125 has had some success in the past , it could be a great shootout between the two sets of fast bowlers			2
@entity122 have spoken about regaining the top of the test rankings , but they have to be realistic about where they ’re at			0
there ’s a long way to go , and their first goal has to be to wrap it up 5 - 0 in @entity171 this week			0
i thought they would be at their most vulnerable at @entity7 , after the euphoria of regaining the ashes at @entity176			2
but they came through a scare at the @entity7 , and now they have a great chance to inflict some scars on the @entity3 team before the sides next meet in 18 months ’ time			1
sorry , @entity3 , but it ’s hard to see it being anything other than 5 - 0 .			2

the tourists have forgotten how to win in a short few months
@entity3 blew their best chance for a victory in @entity7
@entity29 should stay captain , no one else is knocking the door down
@entity68 's retirement was strange *...* he took a potshot at his batsmen
@entity93 being dropped for @entity94 was a surprise
@entity125 and @entity126 have been outstanding
