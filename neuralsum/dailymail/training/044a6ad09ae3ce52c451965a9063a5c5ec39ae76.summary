by @entity1 reporter published : 12:57 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 15:46 est , 14 september 2012 former @entity3 footballer @entity2 has been given the green light to build his controversial ' @entity6 ' home - almost three years after plans were first unveiled			1
the @entity9 pundit , who ditched earlier plans to power the ' carbon neutral ' home with a wind turbine , was yesterday given permission to build the house in the heart of rural @entity16 by @entity19 council ’s planning committee			1
councillor @entity20 , one of the committee members , said the application was innovative and that it was one of the only plans he had seen that was ' code 6 ' - the highest available score on a government energy rating system			2
futuristic : an earlier artist 's impression of @entity2 's eco-home mr @entity20 said : ' the turbine was the main issue for residents and it ’s now gone			1
i believe the exceptional circumstances have been met because of code six and it is still an attractive and modern building			0
' it ’s not too obtrusive for residents and it ’s a build which absolutely protects the environment			0
' i think as a committee we should support this application			0
' @entity46 : the innovative design is intended to have minimal impact on views of the @entity16 hills and has been likened to a @entity52 settlement proposals to include a 100 - foot wind turbine were dropped by the former @entity56 player when developers came up with even ' greener ' ways to power the house - which will be the first carbon - neutral house in @entity19 and in the @entity61			1
it will include a ground source heat pump , sustainable rainwater harvesting and photovoltaic cells , which convert light into electricity			1
@entity69 , representing @entity2 , told the meeting : ' the first application generated over 100 objections , so before this new application we were careful to make sure with local residents , the plans take them into consideration			2
home sweet home : @entity2 can now look forward to building his eco-home after altering the design ' there have been a few obstacles along the way , but the latest application only received two objections			1
' there have been numerous people say to us they are grateful he has gone away and given a more thoughtful application			0
' it will be smaller than before and will only take four to five months to build rather than the original 18 to 20 months			0
' the amount of land the five - bedroom home will take up has been also been reduced , because it will be built over two floors instead of just one storey			0
much of the construction will take place off - site , reducing the time it will take to build the house and the potential noise and disturbance to neighbours .			2

@entity2 's ' innovative ' 5 - bed eco-home designs given planning permission since *abandoning* wind turbine proposal
will be first carbon - neutral house in @entity19 and the @entity61
includes ground source heat pump and rainwater harvesting
