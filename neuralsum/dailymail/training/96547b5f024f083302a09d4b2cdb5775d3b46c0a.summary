the @entity1 is a profligate and inept organisation that has lost public trust after a series of scandals , mps will say today			1
in a landmark report , the @entity0 paint a devastating picture of an organisation that has blown millions and tries to be ‘ all things to all people ’			1
bosses are also accused of blaming others for their blunders and showing ‘ a mind - set completely out of kilter with public sector principles ’			1
the mps , who sit on the @entity19 culture committee , say the £ 145.50 - a - year licence fee is anachronistic and failure to pay it should no longer be a criminal offence			2
and they highlight a ‘ bleak period ’ in the 1970s and 1980s when presenters including @entity25 carried out scores of sex attacks , including rapes , on @entity1 premises			1
‘ we do not see a long - term future for the licence fee in its current form , ’ the report concludes			2
under fire : @entity49 , current director - general of the corporation			2
the @entity1 has been heavily criticised in the 166 - page report , called ' @entity52 of the @entity1 ' to be presented in @entity53 this afternoon , it recommends that : last night @entity55 , who chairs the committee , said : ‘ when an organisation is in receipt of nearly £ 4billion of public money , very big questions have to be asked about how that money is provided and spent , and how that organisation is governed and made accountable			1
‘ in the short term , there appears to be no realistic alternative to the licence fee , but that model is becoming harder and harder to justify and sustain			0
’ the @entity69 mp said the corporation made a valuable contribution to public life , but that it needed to examine its size and scope , and cut certain services			2
critical : conservative mp @entity55 said that while tje corporation made a valuable contribution to public life , it needed to examine its size and scope , and cut certain services he added : ‘ the @entity1 has tried for too long to be all things to all people – with the rapid changes in communication and media technology and markets and changing audience needs and behaviours , this no longer works			1
' it should tailor its output to what it does best , and not stray into areas that can and should be left to commercial providers to do well			0
@entity94 risks losing the ‘ global information war ’ as the @entity95 is out - gunned by foreign state - backed broadcasters			0
mps said the corporation ’s long - established foreign arm could struggle to compete against other networks because of changes to its structure and funding			1
‘ at a time when countries like @entity108 and @entity109 are increasing their investment in media , including services aimed at the @entity94 , we believe that the @entity95 has an increasingly important role in what is a global information war , ’ their report said			2
‘ given its new funding and oversight arrangements , we fear the importance of the @entity95 could be diminished			0
’ until last april , the @entity95 received a separate grant from the @entity121 – but the foreign arm is now funded by the licence fee			0
‘ it is pointless and wasteful having an organisation receiving that kind of public funding competing with – and potentially crowding out – other providers			0
’ anyone watching programmes when they are broadcast requires a television licence , regardless of whether they use a tv or a computer			0
however , there is no legal requirement to pay for watching the same programmes online on catch - up services such as @entity139 after they have aired			2
the mps call for urgent changes that would force people to pay for the iplayer service , for example by blocking non-subscribers			0
the corporation must ‘ prepare itself ’ for the licence fee to be abolished altogether in the 2020s , the report says			0
the levy should be replaced by a flat - rate charge , payable by all households			0
a spokesman for the @entity1 said : ‘ this report confirms the importance of the @entity1 in national life and recommends maintaining and modernising the licence fee , something we have said is necessary			2
‘ we ’re grateful to the committee for endorsing our record for efficiency and maintaining the quality of programmes and services , and note members overwhelmingly voted against moving to a subscription funding model			0
’ the @entity169 said it was ‘ seeking to address ’ some of the problems highlighted in the report			2
the committee took evidence over two years from former @entity1 bosses and from the public			1
send in the auditors to @entity177 : @entity0 say public have lost faith in bosses because of spending scandals the @entity181 must be given unfettered access to the ‘ profligate ’ @entity1 ’s books to ensure it is n’t squandering public money , say mps			1
a succession of spending scandals has ‘ dented ’ public faith in the broadcaster , their report said , and confidence needs restoring			2
. expensive : @entity192 in @entity193 now costs £ 89million a year to run – a third of the cost of running the total @entity1 estate – yet it houses just a fifth of its staff the @entity181 has already censured the @entity1 over the £ 2billion it has spent on three costly building projects , including its £ 1billion @entity193 headquarters , which was delayed by four years and went £ 107million over budget			1
@entity192 now costs £ 89million a year to run – a third of the cost of running the total @entity1 estate – yet it houses just a fifth of its staff			0
the @entity1 should own up to its mistakes and end a culture where bosses try to blame others for their errors , the report claims			1
it says the @entity208 is ‘ beset by problems of its own making ’ , but instead of dealing with them openly , its senior managers point the finger at other people			0
‘ [ there have been ] notable failures and underperformance in certain areas which the @entity1 has not always been ready to acknowledge until well after the fact , ’ it said			0
the @entity1 and the @entity169 should also stop attempting to bury information that could cast the @entity208 in a negative light , it added			1
‘ in our view , the @entity169 and the @entity221 have often tended to highlight favourable performance figures over the less favourable ... the @entity1 should aim to be a better , more transparent , self - critic			1
’ meanwhile , the @entity208 has written off nearly £ 100million on a @entity227 technology project , so badly mismanaged that director general @entity49 decided to scrap it three years in			0
the @entity1 ’s commercial arm , @entity230 , also squandered public funds			1
in 2007 , it bought the travel publisher @entity232 in a deal worth £ 130million			0
however , it failed to make a success of the business , and sold it off at an £ 80 million loss six years later			0
the @entity238 said : ‘ the @entity227 was found to have been mismanaged on a large scale and was dropped having delivered few benefits at a loss of £ 100million			0
‘ @entity230 ’s move into risky commercial activities , not in line with the @entity1 ’s core public service remit , led to a similar loss			1
’ it added : ‘ given the financial problems in the current charter period which dented the @entity1 ’s reputation , the @entity181 must now be given unrestricted access to the @entity1 if it is to provide assurance that the @entity208 is spending money wisely and trading fairly			1
’ mps also slammed the @entity1 over the £ 369million in pay - offs it has handed to departing staff			1
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity181 already has extensive access to the @entity1 ’s affairs and recently produced a report commending the savings we have made on our properties			1
