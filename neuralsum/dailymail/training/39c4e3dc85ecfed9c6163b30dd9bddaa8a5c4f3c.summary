by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 7 november 2013 the long - awaited report into how @entity2 went to war in @entity4 has been delayed indefinitely by a row over new transcripts of conversations between @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
inquiry chairman sir @entity11 has revealed that he has asked for ‘ more than 130 records of conversations ’ between the three men to be declassified			1
his demands have been blocked by cabinet secretary sir @entity16 , @entity2 ’s most senior civil servant			1
long - awaited : @entity4 inquiry chairman sir @entity11 has revealed that his request for ' more than 130 records of conversations ' between @entity9 , @entity8 and @entity10 to be released has been blocked in a letter released on the inquiry website , sir @entity11 says the snarl - up has led him to delay the ‘ @entity25 process ’ , which requires him to inform senior politicians and civil servants if he plans to criticise them in his final report			1
mps last night voiced fears that the inquiry may never conclude and that it is ‘ beyond a joke ’ to let the costs to taxpayers spiral further than the £ 7.4million it has already cost			1
the @entity36 was established by mr @entity8 when he was prime minister			1
but senior civil servants are blocking the publication of private communications between the two @entity41 premiers and the former @entity43 president on the ground that it might prejudice future relations between leaders			1
the descision by cabinet secretary sir @entity16 , @entity2 's most senior civil servant , has spurred fears that the @entity36 will never report the hold - up also involves whether to make public ‘ 25 notes from mr @entity9 to president @entity10 ’ and ‘ some 200 cabinet - level discussions ’ , sir @entity11 said			1
in his letter , sir @entity11 said he and his colleagues ‘ have agreed that the inquiry should not issue those provisional criticisms without a clear understanding of what supporting evidence will be agreed for publication			1
‘ the inquiry has therefore contacted the relevant individuals to notify them that the @entity25 timetable has been delayed and that we are not yet able to confirm when we will be in a position to provide them with the material they expect			1
’ in a letter of reply to sir @entity11 , @entity69 said he was ‘ aware of the scale of the task declassification has presented to a number of government departments ’			1
he added : ‘ i appreciate consideration of the disclosure requests for the remaining sensitive categories of information must be handled sensitively and carefully but i hope that consideration of the final sets of papers can be concluded as soon as possible			1
’ a senior @entity84 mp , who has taken a close interest in the @entity36 , said : ‘ you do wonder whether the @entity36 will ever report			1
‘ it gets to the point where you wonder if there will be any point publishing the conclusions			1
’ @entity92 , @entity93 leader in the @entity94 , said it was ‘ absolutely unacceptable ’ for the documents not to be published			1
he said : ‘ this is preposterous now – it has got beyond a joke			1
' it would be in everyone ’s best interests for all the available evidence to see the light of day so the inquiry can come to a measured and proper conclusion on all the available relevant evidence			1
’ neither mr @entity8 nor mr @entity9 was prepared to comment , but allies of mr @entity8 said he had no objection to the publication of the documents			1
increasing numbers of people – especially the young – believe our political system is a closed circle : secretive , impenetrable and corrupt			1
if you want to know why so many feel alienated , just take a look at a story that speaks volumes about the unaccountability of our political masters			1
sir @entity11 ’s inquiry into @entity2 ’s participation in the invasion of @entity4 , it turns out , has ground to a halt			1
handshake : @entity10 and @entity9 after a meeting in 2001			1
the fallout from the @entity4 war is leading increasing numbers of people to elieve our political system is a closed circle : secretive , impenetrable and corrupt the inquiry wants to release the details of some 25 notes that @entity9 , who was prime minister during the 2003 invasion , sent to the then @entity43 president @entity10			1
he also wants to publish 130 conversations that @entity9 and his successor , @entity8 , had with the @entity43 president , as well as information relating to 200 @entity146 discussions about the invasion and its aftermath			2
quite understandable , you might think			2
for such an inquiry must shed light on these murky matters			2
why bother having one at all if you are going to suppress vital information ? but the cabinet secretary , sir @entity16 , has dug in his heels and is refusing to release the documents			2
as a result , even though @entity11 and his team have seen them , and have drawn on them when writing their report , you and i are barred from reading them			2
thus there is no way for us to weigh up @entity170 ’s conclusions , which means that whatever he may decide , the origins of the @entity172 will probably remain as controversial as ever			2
alas , none of this is very surprising			2
@entity175 has long been engulfed in a culture of secrecy , and the lamentable urge to block , obfuscate and cover up is deeply engrained in our political culture			2
at one level , all this merely confirms the general pointlessness of public inquiries			2
@entity8 set the @entity36 in june 2009 it up , he promised it would take about a year			1
we are still no nearer to discovering the truth the @entity170 operation is in fact the third inquiry into the @entity4 imbroglio , following the @entity193 and @entity194 whitewashes			2
as usual with inquiries of this kind , it has ballooned into a grotesque and vastly expensive circus , and is unlikely to shed any new light or to change anybody ’s opinion			2
when @entity8 set it up , he promised it would take about a year			2
that was in june 2009			2
we are now in november 2013 , and still we are no nearer to discovering the truth			0
as for the costs , they have so far come to a whopping £ 7,474,400 – with plenty more to come			0
the astonishing thing is that , by the standards of public inquiries , @entity11 has not proved especially expensive			0
the @entity213 into @entity214 took 12 years and cost a staggering £ 200million			0
it would have been cheaper just to apologise and give the bereaved families £ 10million each			0
but no : the government thought it was better to give the money to the legal profession instead			0
yet there is something particularly galling about the @entity170 impasse , because the invasion of @entity4 left a permanent stain on our political culture			0
although it is now more than ten years since @entity9 sent in @entity2 troops , the scars of the conflict have yet to heal			0
@entity4 itself is still cursed by regular car bombings , while 179 @entity2 families are still mourning their fallen sons and daughters			0
a decade on , it is clear that the decision to invade was a defining moment , not merely for mr @entity9 ’s premiership , but for a generation ’s attitude to politics			0
quite apart from its other costs , it fundamentally altered the way many people thought about the political process , and not for the better			0
while some two million people marched against the war , many more were profoundly disturbed by the suspicion that our government had lied and dissembled in order to please the @entity43			0
for young people in particular , the controversy seemed to confirm that politics was inherently corrupt			0
in this context , the ludicrous farce of the @entity36 is even more damaging			1
to many people , it will inevitably appear that the @entity175 establishment is protecting its own			0
my own suspicion is that these messages that the cabinet secretary wo n’t make public will probably turn out to be less exciting than we think			0
much as we love to believe in stunning revelations and smoking guns , the reality is usually muddier and more mundane			0
but as the popularity of conspiracy theories suggests , people always like to believe the worst			0
what , they will wonder , do @entity9 and @entity8 have to hide ? what did they tell president @entity10 ? what promises did they make , and what secrets are lurking in the documents ? the great irony , of course , is that the @entity36 was meant to shed light on the dark corners of @entity2 foreign policy , to heal the wounds of the @entity4 invasion , and to restore public faith in the political process			1
yet all of this is so unnecessary			0
for decades , successive governments have come to power promising to roll back the culture of secrecy , yet none of them has done it			0
why the mandarins and their political patrons are so frightened of openness is simply beyond me			0
their @entity43 friends , for example , are much quicker and keener to open their archives and to air their dirty linen in public , and it never does them any harm			0
truth and openness are the building blocks of any successful democratic society			0
the more you hide , the more people suspect and fear you – and the more you play into the hands of juvenile nihilists who prattle about revolution without really understanding what it means			0
it was president @entity318 , of all people , who put it best			0
‘ what really hurts in matters of this sort , ’ he told an aide during the @entity322 , ‘ is not the fact that they occur ... what really hurts is if you try to cover it up			0
’ alas for @entity318 , he did not take his own advice			0
but our politicians really ought to learn the appropriate lesson .			0
