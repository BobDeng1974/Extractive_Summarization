updated : 07:15 est , 29 november 2011 prince @entity0 has been ordered to be on his best behaviour on his latest posting in the @entity3			1
the party - loving prince has been moved to the tiny town of @entity7 in the @entity9 desert for the final stage of a two - month advanced weapons training course			1
@entity12 , mayor of the 1,700 - strong community where many residents are devout @entity15 , says @entity0 should take care as his reputation as a ladies ' man has gone before him			1
one road town : prince @entity0 is training at an air force base just outside the tiny desert community of @entity7 , @entity9 the prince poses in front of an @entity25 helicopter earlier this year			1
he will stay at @entity7 as part of a 12 - week @entity25 training course meeting the locals : prince @entity0 wooed @entity29 in @entity30 last month ' there are probably some fathers here who would go to extremes to protect their daughters , ' said mr @entity12 , 64			1
helicopter pilot @entity0 , 27 , was sent to @entity7 last week , as the conditions mimic those he could face in @entity37			1
he will live at a nearby base for the next month			2
it is a contrast to the past four weeks he spent at the @entity41 base in @entity42 where he could enjoy the nightlife of @entity30			2
' beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we have some very pretty girls here			2
' it is a very quiet town with a lot of good @entity15 people			2
this is n't a party town			2
' the sleepy town - a former stagecoach stop - has just 1,700 residents , one bar - and a Â£ 60 a night hotel designed to look like a @entity59			2
it enjoys a minor notability among aficionados of roadside attractions for its quirky welcome sign which boasts the conurbation is ' home to 17000 friendly people and 5 old crabs '			0
but party central it is n't			0
the reason why , however , it is such an attraction for the @entity75 military is that its soaring daily temperatures - well over @entity78 - bitterly cold nights and arid conditions			0
the prince will live at the local @entity82 base for the next month while he hones his skills and on friday night he was seen at a local pizza restaurant enjoying something to eat - and a couple of beers - with his fellow recruits			0
owner of the @entity90 , @entity91 , said he was one of 30 pilots who stopped off for a bit to eat , ordering a ' meat lovers ' pizza and telling the manager ' that 's the best pizza in the world '			0
' the customers recognised him but they were polite and no - one stared , ' he said			0
waitress @entity101 , 37 , added : ' he was a gentleman			0
@entity7 is a nice small town			1
but we do n't even have a movie theatre to take a girl on a date			0
' it was a relatively quiet night for @entity0 , who has lived up to his wild reputation while stationed for the past four weeks at the @entity41 base in @entity42 , a few hours drive away			0
all there is : bartender @entity110 works at @entity111 , the only nightlife option in @entity7 local lifestyle : cowboy @entity114 has n't even heard of @entity115 ' @entity12 ' he has regularly been seen enjoying the nightlife of @entity30 and is even said to have romanced 26 - year - old cocktail waitress @entity117 , who boasts a large rose tattoo across her midriff - and an even bigger boyfriend			1
although miss @entity29 has vehemently denied a liaison , the pair were photographed apparently kissing at a gig in the @entity124 before heading back to @entity0 's suite at the nearby @entity127 hotel			0
fortunately - or not , as the case may be - @entity7 offers less in the way of nightlife			1
new home : the prince will live at the local @entity82 base for the next month barren : a rusty bridge just outside @entity7 - the terrain in the location is said to be similar to @entity37 party boy : prince @entity0 as he strutted his stuff barefoot on the side of an swimming pool at a @entity142 nightspot during a summer holiday @entity110 , 45 , bartender at @entity111 , the town 's only bar , said : ' sometimes the @entity75 pilots come in here and play pool or have a beer			1
' if we put on a karaoke night that 'll be the only chance of meeting any local girls			0
' mayor @entity12 added : ' it is a pretty quiet nightlife scene here in @entity7			1
' i would advise the prince to take in the beautiful sights of the desert instead			1
' while @entity163 waitress @entity162 , 38 , warned that ' here are a lot of girls in town who would kill to meet a @entity75 prince , i think he is going to be swamped when he comes here ' , others are less impressed			0
cowboy @entity114 , 49 , interviewed on his horse , said : ' i have no idea who @entity173 [ sic ] is .			0

@entity7 was chosen by the @entity176 for @entity178 training because the desert region *resembles* the mountain terrain of @entity37
