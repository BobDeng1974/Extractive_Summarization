by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 11:54 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 20:55 est , 4 april 2013 more than one in three victims of anti-social behaviour say their calls to police have made no difference			1
and the problem is even worse among those whose lives are made a misery by yobs in their neighbourhood			0
nearly half of the victims who suffer the most said officers took no action			2
details of the scale of police failings over anti-social behaviour were revealed in a report by academics published yesterday			1
calling the police about antisocial behaviour makes no difference , according to a third of victims ( stock image ) tragic : @entity29 suffered years of abuse a survey of nearly 10,000 victims revealed that people tormented by gangs of thugs were most likely to ‘ fall through the net ’			1
critics said the study showed forces can not be relied on to protect the public from threatening behaviour , vandalism and intimidation			1
it came as one force was criticised for plans to categorise attacks on goths and punks as ‘ hate crimes ’			0
dr @entity51 , of the @entity53 think - tank , said : ‘ @entity54 have announced they are going to pay special attention to groups identified by their lifestyle , clothing and make - up , such as goths and punks			1
' this is another example of the police spending too much time trying to please pressure groups that demand preferential treatment			2
instead , they should devote their resources to providing equal protection for all			0
’ the @entity71 study comes more than five years after police were castigated for their failure to protect @entity29 and her disabled daughter @entity74			1
after ten years of abuse and repeated failures by police and council officials , mrs @entity29 killed herself and her daughter in 2007 by setting fire to their car in a layby near their home in @entity86 , @entity87			0
the survey found that people tormented by gangs of louts were mostly likely to ' fall through the net ' ( posed by models ) the study found that ‘ the repeat and vulnerable victim ’ was most likely to ‘ fall through the net ’			0
it said 35 per cent of victims who made initial complaint calls to the police saw ‘ no difference ’ , compared to 45 per cent of repeat victims			2
the study looked at 9,311 victims who called police in @entity106 and @entity107 in a one - month period in 2011			1
more than half said they called the police three or more times in a year and one in five made ten or more calls over a 12 - month period			1
it found the well - off and middle classes were among the most likely to be repeat victims			2
the survey found 47 per cent of those targeted more than once were from the @entity120 social classes			0
the authors of the report , professor @entity123 and dr @entity124 , said their study ‘ reaffirms that this type of problem is pervasive and has the potential to cause significant harm to the individuals concerned ’			0
the @entity53 think - tank said the police could no longer be relied upon to protect the public from gangs ( file image ) they added that , ‘ the repeat caller is often an individual who feels that their first report of anti-social behaviour has been , or continues to be , unsuccessful ’			1
a police spokesman said they would get better at identifying vulnerable victims			2
the report was published alongside data from the police inspectorate which scored forces on how well they were tackling the problem			0
the @entity150 , the country ’s largest force , was among the worst performers , along with the @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 forces			0
@entity158 were @entity159 and @entity160 .			0

survey by academics at @entity71 looked at 9,311 crime victims
it showed how more than one in three who called police felt they did *n't* help
@entity53 think - tank says it shows police can not be relied upon to help public
