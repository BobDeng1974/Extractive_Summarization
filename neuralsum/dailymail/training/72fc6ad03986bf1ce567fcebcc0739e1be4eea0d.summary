@entity1 agents tried to stop a suspected @entity3 mall gunman from leaving the country for a life of terror three years ago			1
@entity9 , a 23 - year - old @entity13 whom @entity11 authorities believe was one of the terrorists in the @entity17 seige , was ' well - known ' to the @entity19 domestic intelligence service , its chief said yesterday			1
@entity19 agents tried several times to persuade him to abandon plans to move to @entity13 in 2010 - and join jihadist group @entity23 - but failed to stop the young man			1
on sunday it announced that it had recovered the remains of four of the gunmen , who were filmed coldly gunning down fleeing shoppers in the upscale mall			2
though @entity19 have not yet confirmed that he was one of the attackers , @entity44 , the head of the agency , revealed the dealings with @entity9 , who spent his youth in @entity1 after his family moved there in 1999			1
she said : ' we had several talks with him ... before he left @entity1 more than three years ago			1
obviously we did n't succeed , but there was quite an effort put into the preventive side of this			0
' ms @entity44 did not give any greater detail on the conversations , and admitted that he ' most likely ' was killed in the seige			2
on sunday the @entity11 government said it believes it has recovered the remains of four gunmen caught carrying out the attack in @entity28 footage			2
youth : this photo shows @entity9 in @entity70 , @entity1 , in 2007 wearing a @entity72 football shirt the @entity13 extremist group @entity23 claimed responsibility , saying the attack was in retribution for @entity11 's military involvement in @entity13			1
@entity9 's sister confirmed last week that her brother went to the @entity13 capital of @entity81 for a three - month visit in 2009 , then moved to @entity13 permanently in march 2010			1
but she said she did n't believe he was among the gunmen seen in the footage			0
just days after @entity9 's identity became known , @entity1 police issued international alerts for two @entity1 - @entity13 sisters , aged 16 and 19 , who told their family they were traveling to @entity91 to join the civil war			1
they were last spotted on the @entity95 - @entity91 border			0
' we see a growing problem when it comes to people traveling to war zones , and specifically in the last year we 've seen a growing number of persons traveling to @entity91 , ' ms @entity44 said			2
she estimated that between 30 and 40 people have left @entity1 to join the @entity91 civil war , but said the number is uncertain and could be even larger			2
that conflict has attracted hundreds of foreign fighters from @entity110 countries , including many members of @entity113 militant groups			0
many intelligence services are worried at the damage these fighters could do when they return home with combat experience and terrorist training - and possibly combat trauma			1
ms @entity121 said : ' when they are radicalised and when they are determined to go , for instance to @entity91 or other conflict areas , we do n't have many legal measures to stop them '			0
it is now illegal in @entity1 to receive training from terror groups - but police and intelligence services struggle to prove whether would - be militants are leaving the country for legitimate reasons - or to join jihadist groups			1
brainwashed : according to one of his relatives who watched @entity28 footage of shooting he may ' have been brainwashed ' ms @entity121 said her agency tries to engage with potential terrorists and dissuade them from leaving , but that it often does n't work			2
she said : ' we do preventive work			0
we try to persuade them not to go , because it 's a dangerous journey			0
' i wish we were more successful			0
we have succeeded in turning some around from traveling			0
but quite a few have actually left			0
' she called on parents , child protective services , police and @entity157 leaders to intervene when young @entity157 seem at risk of becoming radicalised .			0

@entity9 is believed to be one of the @entity17 gunmen
he is a @entity13 but grew up in @entity1 , as his family moved there in 1999
now @entity1 intelligence services he was ' well - known ' to them
@entity44 said the @entity19 agency tried to stop him leaving for a life of terror in @entity13 in 2010 , but failed
