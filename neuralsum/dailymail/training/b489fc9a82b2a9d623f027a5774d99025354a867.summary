january was a quiet month for @entity0 in terms of transfers but there was one move @entity6 ’s manager knew he had to make			1
having watched @entity7 grow and develop in 24 demanding games on loan for @entity10 , @entity0 felt compelled to bring him back to @entity11 and see if he could make a contribution in the frantic pursuit of a @entity15 place			1
it might have seemed an unusual decision , to give a 19 - year - old with such little top flight experience such a big responsibility , but @entity0 ’ thinking was clear			2
while staying in the @entity23 would have aided his education , why should another manager benefit when he could aid @entity6 ? @entity7 rattles the post with a long - range effort during the @entity11 derby on saturday @entity7 dribbles with the ball while being tracked by @entity30 forward @entity29 and do not doubt that @entity0 rates him			1
he has regularly spoken of him in glowing terms , saying that if you turned up at @entity39 and were unaware of who was who in his squad , you would have @entity7 down as @entity34 or @entity35 given his technical ability and skill			1
‘ we brought him back because with system we play ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) , he can play in four positions , ’ @entity0 explained ahead of this trip to @entity44			1
‘ there is greater chance for him to play			2
i felt for six months , he needed to go out and play consistently			0
‘ he went with @entity52 at @entity10 , who is a very good coach and plays really good football			0
this was the ideal time to bring him back and he has matured really well			0
it is unfortunate he is not able to play in cup games but he has got incredible talent			0
my job is to nurture that			0
’ so back came @entity7 and , true to his word , @entity0 has given him minutes , first at @entity61 then against @entity62 before , most significantly , unleashing him from the start in the frenzy of a @entity11 derby			1
@entity67 's @entity66 puts in a tackle on @entity7 during the first half at @entity44 the @entity6 youngster robs @entity71 of the ball during the @entity74 clash @entity0 is n’t afraid to make big calls nor does he ever consider age if he thinks a player is good enough , so with @entity78 nursing a back problem , in came the @entity80 youth international , whose first @entity6 appearance in may 2013 came on the day @entity83 retired			1
if the game was a disappointment , one of the most ordinary , tame and mundane 90 minutes this grand old fixture has ever witnessed , @entity7 most certainly was n’t and he was responsible for providing the genuine moments of entertainment			2
first there was electric charge down the right flank , then a chance arriving on to a @entity94 cross before , most spectacularly of all , he cracked a drive against the side of a post from 25 yards after he had turned @entity66 one way then the other			0
while others wanted too many touches and were deliberate with their passes , @entity7 was constantly looking for a way to stamp his name on the game right until the very end			2
fearless and exciting , this will not be the last we see of him			0
his future is certainly bright			0
@entity7 could be part of a very bright future for @entity6 under @entity0 @entity7 's heat map , as can be seen in @entity115 's @entity114 feature			1

@entity6 drew 0 - 0 with @entity67 at @entity44 on saturday
@entity118 youngster @entity7 was handed a start in the clash
@entity7 came *closest* to breaking the *deadlock* but his shot hit the *bar*
