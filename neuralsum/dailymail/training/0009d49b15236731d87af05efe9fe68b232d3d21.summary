by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 11:06 est , 1 february 2013 hospitals should be policed by an army of inspectors that include doctors and nurses to prevent major scandals and unnecessary deaths , a landmark report will warn next week			1
the long - awaited public inquiry into the scandal - hit @entity10 is expected to recommend more experienced inspectors and an overhaul of the regulatory system			1
the report will recommend drastic reforms of how hospitals are policed in an attempt to stop a repeat of events at @entity21 where up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly over a four - year period , reports @entity24			1
up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly over a four - year period at @entity21 , where patients were found to have been treated ' appallingly ' the £ 11million inquiry , led by @entity28 , is examining what went wrong at the trust between january 2005 and march 2009			1
between 400 and 1,200 more people died than would have been expected over that period , the @entity31 said			2
mr @entity34 ' first report in 2010 found there was often ' shocking ' care at @entity21			0
many patients were ' neglected ' , with calls for help to use the bathroom ignored , food and drink left out of patients ' reach , pain relief administered late or not at all , ' awful ' hygiene , and much more			2
some staff showed ' a disturbing lack of compassion ' , while ' fear and bullying ' dissuaded others from flagging up their concerns			0
the long - awaited inquiry by @entity28 ( pictured ) is expected to recommend a new army of hospital inspectors doctors were diverted from critically ill patients to deal with less serious cases that were at risk of breaching a central target to discharge all patients from @entity63 units within four hours			1
vulnerable patients were left so thirsty that they were forced to drink water out of flower vases ; others were left starving and in soiled bedsheets			2
last month , the scandal - hit hospital paid out more than £ 1million in compensation for ' inhumane and degrading ' treatment			1
the new army of inspectors is thought to be in response to the fact that such serious failings occurred despite there being various regulatory bodies in place			1
huge questions remain over how such appalling standards of care continued for so long and why the relevant authorities did not intervene			0
@entity34 is expected to call for hospitals to undergo more regular and thorough inspections			0
a key move will be to get more experts with clinical experience , such as doctors and nurses , to join the 955 inspectors currently used by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) in @entity94 hospital visits			0
many of the current inspectors are thought to have a background in care homes and social work rather than the @entity94			0
in future , @entity100 , which regulates @entity94 trusts , will be expected to share concerns about financial problems so the @entity31 can check if patient care is being affected			0
and to tackle problems earlier , a recommendation will be made that the @entity31 's use of intelligence about hospital care is bolstered , using information from patient complaints , media reports and the results of clinical audits .			0

long - awaited public inquiry into the scandal - hit @entity10 to be published next week
up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly
*crackdown* after such serious failings occurred despite various regulatory bodies being in place
