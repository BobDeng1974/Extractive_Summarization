a legal bid to end ' slopping out ' in @entity2 prisons could force the government to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to upgrade its jails			1
the lawsuit has been launched by child rapist @entity6 , who claims that the practice breaches his human rights			1
if successful , the case will force the government to ensure that in - cell toilets are available 24 hours a day in all the country 's prisons			1
abolished : but slopping out still happens in some @entity2 prisons slopping out - the use of a bucket as a toilet when there is no in - cell sanitation at a prison - was formally abolished in the @entity2 in 1996			1
but a report by the @entity22 of @entity23 published in august last year revealed that 10 @entity2 prisons are still occasionally using the system			1
convict : @entity6 claims that being denied access to a toilet breaches his human rights @entity6 , who served time at @entity30 on the @entity31 , claims his human rights were violated by the ' degrading ' process of sometimes having to use a bucket as a toilet in his cell during the night			1
he is joined in his claim by fellow @entity39 inmates , @entity40 and @entity41 , and should the trio succeed the floodgates will open for more than 300 other ex-cons bringing similar actions			2
because of the financial difficulty of making alterations to some jails , especially those built in the @entity51 era , the practice of slopping out still persists in a number of prisons when normal systems break down			2
but now the claim spearheaded by @entity6 , which has reached the @entity58 , is seeking to force the extinction of slopping out , whatever the cost			2
should it succeed , lawyers say , the government will have to spend many millions ' rebuilding ' the offending jails			2
prisoners are threatening legal action against prison chiefs because they only get one tv channel showing @entity71 football			1
inmates can get @entity73 1 in their cells , but have lodged a formal complaint to try and access other subscription sports channels			1
a row broke out yesterday over their demand for ' sports rights ' , with an mp saying many people on the outside can not afford the @entity73 channels			1
bosses at the @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88 , confirmed prisoners get @entity73 1 in their cells for good behaviour			1
but warders at the category b prison say they ca n't afford @entity73 at home - while the prisoners get it for free			1
one warder said : ' they have tv piped into their cells and can spend all day watching @entity73 1			1
' but they 're hacked off because they do n't have @entity73 and 3			1
they 've even been moaning it is a breach of their human rights			2
' it 's a cushy number			2
i 've stayed in hotels that do n't have the facilities the prisoners get here			2
' mp @entity107 , chairman of the @entity109 select committee in the @entity110 , said : ' i am aghast that we are paying for prisoners to watch @entity113			0
' it beggars belief that they are complaining about this - i have n't even got @entity73 myself			1
what next ? will prisoners be given a box at the @entity119 for rugby matches ? ' people should not be put in prison to spend their days watching expensive satellite packages			0
they should be educated and learn skills for their rehabilitation when they come out			0
' @entity6 was jailed for 15 years in 1998 after being convicted of rape , attempted rape , incitement of one boy to rape another , and three counts of indecent assault			0
@entity133 , barrister for @entity40 and @entity41 , said after a pre-trial review of the case that the government was seeking to block the move for financial reasons			0
' these claims are not really about damages - it is a matter of principle , and trying to get the system changed , ' said mr @entity133			0
' that is why the government is so concerned - because they would have to start rebuilding prisons			0
' he added that there are some 328 similar claims waiting in the wings and that about 2,000 prisoners in the @entity2 are affected			0
the claimants ' solicitor said that renovating just one prison would cost close to £ 100million			0
' in @entity157 alone , reports conclude that it would cost upward of £ 12million to provide sanitation and , in doing so , the prison would either lose 700 cells , or need £ 70million to replace them , ' he said			0
papers lodged with the court by @entity6 in 2006 , kept secret from the public until last week , allege that the rapist was forced to endure a sub-standard lifestyle in @entity157 between 2005 and 2006			0
the claim states that he was in continuous danger to his physical and emotional health because of the need to use a bucket and that @entity173 of the @entity174 - the prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment - was breached by the necessity to slop out			0
the @entity180 's lawyer denies that toilet facilities are a human right , saying : ' the life of a prisoner must necessarily be controlled			0
' the case is set to begin at the @entity58 in @entity186 on november 14 , and will be the first time the courts in @entity189 and @entity190 have judged the issue .			0
