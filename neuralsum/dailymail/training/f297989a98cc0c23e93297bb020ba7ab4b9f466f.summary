he had been at war with @entity9 and @entity10 , his @entity12 ministerial deputy , over free lunches for pupils aged from five to seven			1

conservatives are concerned about the rising costs of the policy , which has been enthusiastically promoted by deputy prime minister mr @entity9			0
last friday , private emails showed mr @entity0 had warned that giving an extra £ 80million to help implement the policy risked affecting the quality of teaching and learning			2
@entity12 sources branded mr @entity0 an ‘ ideological zealot ’ and mr @entity15 , unusually , failed to appear alongside the education secretary in the @entity41 this week			1

the pair say the policy will be a challenge to implement although most schools seem to be on track			0
they played down the whole row , explaining : ‘ to judge from the latest breathless headlines , you might expect the two of us to be crouched under our desks like the last survivors in a @entity66 movie , only popping out occasionally to blast each other with shotguns			0
’ they claim the priority of both coalition partners is now ‘ improving education not fighting political battles ’			2

they went on : ‘ @entity92 after the current political spats are forgotten and our own political careers have ended , this policy will be helping create a generation of young people who are healthier , happier and doing better in their studies			0
’ ‘ we are certainly both passionate advocates of this policy and working together we are determined to ensure a successful delivery ’ , they concluded			2
this week mr @entity0 ’s former special adviser , @entity103 , accused the @entity12 leader of lying about the funding of free school meals to cover up an ‘ abuse of taxpayers ’ money ’			1
at the weekend , the @entity12 hit back , accusing mr @entity0 of ‘ lunacy ’ for draining £ 400million from key budgets to fill a black hole in funding for his flagship free schools project			1
the @entity115 was called to the @entity41 on tuesday to answer an urgent question about free schools			0
in an apparent sign of @entity120 tensions , however , mr @entity15 did not appear alongside him , as would be customary			0
