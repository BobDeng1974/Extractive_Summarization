the @entity1 group unanimously objected to their song being used in an anniversary exhibition fot the @entity4 claiming it would send out the ' wrong signals ' it was the song that catapulted them to international stardom – and set them on the road to amassing multi-million - pound fortunes			1
but @entity13 are now strangely reluctant to repay the debt they owe to the famous battle that helped inspire their 1974 hit @entity17			1
the @entity1 group were asked to help commemorate next year 's 200th anniversary of the battle by allowing the first vinyl cut of the @entity23 - winning track to form part of an exhibition			1
but the group unanimously objected , claiming it would send the ' wrong signals ' about their song			1
last night , military historian @entity29 condemned the band 's decision			0
he said : ' it seems rather po - faced			0
' it is a great shame people do n't want to help with a project which is all about educating young people about this important event			0
' @entity17 200 , which is organising next year 's celebrations , had hoped to borrow the original disc from the @entity40 in the @entity1 capital , @entity42 , so that it could be included in an exhibition of 200 objects illustrating the importance and influence of the 1815 battle			1
@entity48 , the chief executive of @entity49 , said : ' it is a shame that @entity13 wo n't lend us the original copy of the record			2
' we are keen that as many people as possible should embrace the commemorations and we thought including the song would be a good way of illustrating how the battle has impacted on popular culture			2
it would also have been a useful way of raising awareness of the events of 1815 among people who are familiar with the song but do n't know anything about the battle that inspired it			2
' but , refusing the request , @entity13 insisted the song is not about the actual battle , when @entity72 forces led by @entity73 were beaten by @entity75 and @entity76 armies			1
the song has the famous opening lyric ' my , my , at @entity79 did surrender ' – and during the hit 's 1974 @entity23 performance , conductor @entity80 actually dressed as @entity73			0
the song has the famous opening lyric ' my , my , at @entity79 did surrender ' – and during the hit 's 1974 @entity23 performance , conductor @entity80 actually dressed as @entity73 ( pictured is a painting of the 1815 battle ) a spokeswoman said the group 's four members – @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 – all agreed that the loan of the disc would have been inappropriate			1
she said : ' the question has come to us and we have said no to it			0
the issue was discussed by all four members of the band			0
' the song is n't about the @entity4 and we do n't want the record to be part of the exhibition			0
it gives the wrong signals			1
' @entity17 is a pop song about someone meeting their own @entity17			1
it is not about the battle			0
' mr @entity29 said it was perhaps ironic that the song 's lyrics were actually inaccurate			0
he joked : ' this is one of those rare occasions when @entity13 got it wrong			2
@entity73 did not surrender at @entity17 , but aboard @entity122 a month later			0

@entity1 group were asked if song could be used for anniversary exhibition
