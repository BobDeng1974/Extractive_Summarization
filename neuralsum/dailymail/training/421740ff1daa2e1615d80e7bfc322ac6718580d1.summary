by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 07:27 est , 6 december 2012 an 18 - stone mother - of - one was shamed into losing weight after snapping her daughter 's bed while reading her a bedtime story			1
@entity6 , 26 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , spent her whole 20s as a morbidly obese size 24 , but crushing four - year - old @entity12 's bed was the final straw , and she embarked upon a life - changing diet			1
just one year later she has lost eight stone , dropped to a size 10 , and married her fiance @entity17 in her dream wedding dress			1
@entity6 said : ' i 'd had enough of being overweight			2
i have a four - year - old daughter called @entity12 and being overweight was having a huge impact on my life ' @entity6 with @entity12 before losing the weight , left , and on her wedding day , right @entity6 , who works in marketing , had always struggled with her weight , but when even her size 24 clothes were getting too tight and she realised she desperately wanted to lose weight and wear fashionable clothes like her friends , instead of being forced to shop in plus - sized stores and simply buying anything that fitted			1
@entity6 , whose maiden name was @entity35 , said : ' i 'd tried every diet under the sun but never had the motivation to continue with it			2
but i 'd had enough of being overweight			0
i have a four - year - old daughter called @entity12 and being overweight was having a huge impact on my life			1
' @entity6 in her dream wedding dress on her wedding day with her husband @entity43 and daughter @entity12 one night , having asked her 29 - year - old fiance to carry @entity12 up to bed because she could n't fit through the stair gate , @entity6 followed them upstairs and lay down on the edge of the bed with her daughter to read her a story			1
' i heard a loud snap , ' she said			0
' i 'd literally broken the entire side beam of her bed because i was overweight			2
' @entity6 had a similar moment of clarity while on her first family holiday with @entity17 and @entity12 in @entity59 last year when she could n't fit the aeroplane seatbelt around her			1
@entity61 before she lost eight stone , playing with her daughter @entity12 in a swimming pool she said : ' i thought i was going to have to ask for a seat belt extension and the thought of this humiliation made me force the seat belt closed but it was so tight and uncomfortable , i was relieved when the seat belt sign was switched off			1
' i had the most wonderful daughter and fiancé and i should have been the happiest girl in the world , but in reality i was desperately unhappy ' ' i knew after that i did n't want to go on holiday again at that weight and the ever - familiar guilt of knowing what that would take away from my family made me feel terrible			1
' @entity6 added : ' i had the most wonderful daughter and fiancé and i should have been the happiest girl in the world , but in reality i was desperately unhappy with my weight controlling every thought that i had and everything that we did or did n't do			1
' @entity6 was also desperate to set a date for her wedding but again kept putting it off because of her weight , terrified she would n't find a dress that fitted her			1
@entity6 said : ' the thought of subjecting my beautiful little girl to a lifetime of weight - battling misery and ill - health was too much for me to bear			1
in that moment , i knew i had to make a change and it had to be now ' it was a newspaper article that finally shocked @entity103 into losing the weight for good			0
she said : ' the article explained how daughters of obese mothers were much more likely to grow up to be obese themselves			0
' it might as well have been written about me and my daughter			0
she was already starting to copy my bad eating habits , asking for the fizzy drinks and junk food that i was eating			0
' i realised the article was a stark warning about the issues that my daughter would be faced with because of me - diabetes , heart disease , and eventually premature death			2
' the thought of subjecting my beautiful little girl to a lifetime of weight - battling misery and ill - health was too much for me to bear			0
in that moment , i knew i had to make a change and it had to be now			0
' @entity6 was able to wear her dream , size 10 wedding dress on her big day @entity6 began the @entity128 in june 2011 , swapping her high - calorie diet for soups , shakes and bars			1
' my weight literally began to drop off , ' she said			0
' in no time at all i was wearing smaller clothes and was over the moon the first time i brought a size 16 , i could n't believe it fitted			2
' for the first time i began to really believe that i could do this			0
people started noticing and i fell in love with exercise			0
' in august this year , @entity6 - who has now been crowned @entity128 's slimmer of the year - reached her goal weight of 10 stone and dropped from a size 24 to a size 10			1
' i could n't believe it , ' said @entity6			2
' my entire approach to food has changed , and my daughter 's eating habits have radically changed too			2
' she never asks for fizzy drinks now , it 's nearly always water , and her new favourite thing in the world is broccoli ! ' @entity6 on her wedding day with husband @entity17 , left , and wearing one of the dresses she would never have fit into before her weight loss @entity6 added : ' my life is so different and sometimes i feel like i 'm someone else			1
i love shopping , wearing dresses and skirts			0
gone are the baggy tops and my black wardrobe			0
' my fiancé and i also finally set a date for our wedding and on 3 november we got married			2
i felt amazing and instead of wearing the size 16 dress i 'd bought as my incentive to lose weight , i ended up wearing a size 10			1
' i still have to pinch myself to think that i 've come this far			0
' @entity6 says the best thing about losing the weight is being able to lay with her daughter again on her bed instead of sitting on the floor next to her			1
she said : ' recently i was reading @entity185 to @entity12 and she turned to me and said : " that was like you was n't it mummy ? you ate too much and got really fat , but now you 've turned into a beautiful butterfly "			1
only a four - year - old can say something like that and really mean it			0
i have truly turned my life and my family 's life around and now there 's no going back			0
