by @entity0 a jogger has captured the clearest picture yet of the elusive ‘ @entity3 ’ lurking in the waters of the @entity5			0
the 6ft predator was allegedly first spotted by a bus driver who prompted a full - scale police search back in february			1
a number of other possible sightings emerged but the mysterious creature has not been seen for five months			1
@entity14 , a @entity23 national living in @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ' i was running close to the @entity15 and suddenly i saw something in the water			1
' i had heard about a crocodile but that was a long time ago , so when i went home i checked on the internet and i saw that other people had seen it too			0
' i felt scared at the time because the thing - whatever it was - was moving in the water			1
' i wanted to stay to see it properly but there was no one around and i just did n’t feel comfortable			0
' @entity14 , who works in clothes shop @entity42 , added : ' i could feel my hair start to stand on end and i thought ‘ @entity47 , is it a crocodile ? ’ and i just left the place			1
' fears a crocodile was on the loose in @entity25 were first triggered when @entity5 and @entity51 police chief constable @entity52 tweeted that a bus driver had reported a sighting from @entity55			2
joke : one local comedian put up this warning sign as the search for the crocodile continued mr @entity52 revealed the police had launched an investigation , but a search ' found no trace ' of the beast on monday , february 3			1
a second sighting of the alleged crocodile came from mother - of - three @entity68 , 41 , of @entity69 , who saw the beast two days later			2
local councillor @entity71 , 39 , then captured video footage a week later			0
since then the crocodile had not been spotted until @entity14 was out on a run on tuesday evening			2
reptile expert ‘ @entity76 ’ - one of @entity78 ’s only approved reptile rescue specialists and a regular on @entity79 shows such as @entity75 - said it is not impossible for a crocodile to survive in @entity78 waters			2
@entity15 , where jogger @entity14 believes she spotted the ' @entity3 ' moving around in the water however , he warned only a very large reptile could survive - and speculated it could be an alligator			1
he said : ' it would be hard for a crocodile to deal with the cold temperatures for five months as it would be unable to break down food			0
' having said that if it was a big crocodile it would probably be able to survive that long , and the relatively mild winter would have helped			0
' it ’s more likely that it would be an alligator because they do n’t necessarily need warmer waters to survive			0
' it ’s quite difficult to tell what it is from the pictures , but while it ’s unlikely it ’s a crocodile it is n’t impossible			0

@entity14 **'s** hair stood on end when she spotted the creature moving in the water
there have been a number of sightings but the 29 - year - old **'s** image is the clearest yet
reptile specialist fears it may in fact be an alligator - which can grow to 4.6m in *length*
police launched search in february but found no trace of beast
