by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 7 december 2012 former @entity2 guard @entity1 , 88 , has appealed against a deportation ruling arguing he was forced to serve in the @entity4 a former @entity2 concentration camp guard , who has lived in the @entity7 for more than 50 years , has launched an appeal arguing he should not be deported because he was forced to join the @entity4 as a teenager			1
the case of @entity1 , 88 , was yesterday being heard at the @entity11 in @entity12 , the nation 's highest immigration court , where his lawyer argued that he had served in @entity17 's army against his will			1
at a 2010 hearing , @entity1 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , acknowledged serving in the @entity4 as a guard in the @entity25 and @entity26 concentration camps for which a federal judge ordered he should be deported to any country that would take him , of which one possibility was @entity31			1
but his lawyer @entity32 argued that the court should have considered that @entity1 was forced to join the @entity4 against his will as a 17 - year - old			1
government lawyers argued to uphold the deportation saying federal law places former nazis in a harsher immigration category , and no exceptions should be made because of compulsory service			2
mr @entity32 acknowledged that @entity43 did indeed place nazis in a separate , harsher category when it comes to determining their rights to immigrate to and live in the @entity7 but he said that not everyone conscripted into the @entity17 war machine is truly a @entity2			2
he argued : ' the label @entity2 itself sort of goes to belief			2
if they were a true believer , we do n't want them here			0
if they were a forced participant , are they really a @entity2 ? ' @entity1 , who was recently hospitalized , did not attend yesterday 's hearing			1
he came to the @entity7 in 1956 and was naturalized in 1962			0
he lived in @entity19 , about 75 miles north of @entity59 , where he worked in a steel mill for decades and raised five children			1
@entity65 lawyer @entity64 questioned whether @entity1 's service as a camp guard was truly involuntary			2
she said he could have requested a transfer back to the @entity70 front , where he was initially serving , or that he could have simply walked away from service or defied immoral orders			0
she said the @entity73 after @entity74 and military code established the precedent that following immoral orders is not an adequate defense			0
' i 'm sorry - mr. @entity1 did engage in crimes against humanity , ' @entity64 said			1
@entity32 took exception to the portrayal of @entity1 as a war criminal			0
@entity1 says he was forced to join the @entity4 in 1942 , and that he never killed anyone , though tens of thousands are believed to have died at @entity26 and @entity25			1
tragic times : soldiers of the @entity2 arrest factory leaders concentration bunks : wooden bunks stand inside a children 's barracks , @entity93 , at @entity94 , part of @entity94 , the largest @entity2 concentration camp and extermination camp in operation during @entity74 @entity1 does not dispute that the @entity2 camps were horrific , and he previously told prosecutors he was ashamed of his service			1
' i was not proud where i served and i did n't like it then and i did n't like it now , ' he said			0
@entity32 argued that a 2009 @entity105 decision requires immigration judges to consider whether an alleged perpetrator of persecution was doing so voluntarily			0
more broadly , he said @entity7 law in nearly all aspects takes into account whether a person was forced to act against his will , and he said the same principles should be extended to @entity1 's case			2
the three members of the @entity11 that heard the case - two appointed by @entity118 , one by a @entity119 - are expected to issue their ruling in a few months			0
while it is the highest immigration court , it is an administrative body and its rulings are subject to review by federal judges and the @entity105			0
it is expected that the board 's ruling will be appealed by the losing side			0
tucked away : @entity1 has been living in the small western @entity20 town @entity19 for more than 50 years the @entity25 and @entity26 camps held some political and military prisoners , but tens of thousands of people also died there under horrific conditions , such as starvation , slave labor , medical experiments , and executions			1
@entity138 , the senior historian at the @entity139 , said that it 's ‘ very difficult ’ to tell whether any particular individual actually volunteered for the @entity4 , or was pressured to join			2
but he said the guards were essential to the concentration camp system			0
‘ even if they do n't have any contact with a prisoner , by walking the perimeter as an armed guard , they are helping to keep the people inside that place where they are enduring persecution , ’ @entity138 said , adding that @entity4 guards were paid , got leave time , and health benefits for their service			1
most of the hearing , though , dealt not with @entity1 's actions during the war but on narrow questions of legal precedent .			0

@entity1 , 88 , claims he was forced to join the @entity4 as a 17 - year - old
he has lived in @entity19 , @entity20 for over 50 years
he did n't tell his family about his @entity2 service until 2004
justice *department* lawyers said he engaged in ' crimes against humanity '
