he said : ' it 's not personal			0
we 've got a couple of @entity1 fans in the office and the chap who does all our stats is a @entity1 fan so he 's keeping a particular eye on it			2
' if they 're on last by the end of the season the most , then it means they 'll still be in the @entity58 , because they wo n't be drawn into those big relegation battles that feature highly in the programme			0
' league leaders @entity61 have been on first the most so far - seven times - when looking at every saturday night @entity63 highlights programme since the start of the season , plus the three festive editions on @entity68 , december 28 and @entity27			1
we looked at every saturday night @entity58 highlights programme , plus the three festive editions on @entity68 , december 28 and @entity27 of @entity6 this season to see how popular your team is ... @entity25 : @entity74 's entertainers have featured in the top three on nine occasions , and have never been on last			2
@entity12 : the @entity58 's lowest scorers have been bottom of the bill six times - once less than @entity1			1
they have not featured in the top match all season - only @entity84 can match that - but have been in the top three five times			1

they have not been back in top spot since			0
@entity114 : three appearances in top spot for the @entity117 - two in consecutive weekends on september 20 and 27 - but no wins			2
three appearances in the bottom spot too			2
@entity122 : the foxes may be bottom of the table but curiously have been third on more than any other side - five times in total			1
@entity129 : the @entity130 finished second in the @entity58 last season but their comparative struggles this time around are reflected by the fact that they have been on last three times			2
@entity26 : the @entity136 have featured first five times - second only to @entity61 - and in the top three 15 times , more than any other club			1
@entity139 united : @entity141 's men have only topped the bill twice , and have featured in the top three six times in their 11 appearances in the shows surveyed			1

@entity153 : they may be 19th but their four appearances in the top slot is second only to the league 's top two @entity61 and @entity26			1
only one appearance at the bottom of the bill			2
@entity20 : saints have been first on just once - the 8 - 0 hammering of @entity1 - and have made only two further appearances in the top three , despite being third in the league			1
@entity84 : along with @entity12 the only side yet to feature in the top match			2
six top - three appearances and three bottom - of - the - bill showings for the @entity169			1
@entity1 : appear to have drawn the short straw			2
last on the programme a table - topping seven times , with one win and four defeats to show from their five top - three appearances , with one of those losses the pasting at @entity180 's			1
@entity14 : @entity182 's men may be irked to discover that they have been bottom of the bill more than any other side in the top half - five times in total			1
it all started so well - they were first on with their win at @entity191 on the opening day			2
@entity193 : @entity193 ' appearances in the programmes covered by our survey have been limited to 11 this season , primarily caused by their @entity200 involvement , but just four top - three appearances in total does still seem a rather slim return			0
@entity204 : despite their struggles this season , the @entity204 have not featured in the bottom spot once			2
they have been on first three times so far , but all three matches were defeats			0
@entity211 : the highest - placed side to feature at the bottom of the bill - their 0 - 0 draw with @entity12 at @entity216 on november 8			1
@entity61 have been top of the bill more than any club this season , with @entity26 up next and then @entity153 @entity222 's @entity61 top the @entity58 table as well as the @entity6 bill this season @entity222 , who joined @entity61 from @entity225 in the summer , has scored 17 times for the league leaders the running order for each week 's @entity6 is a hot topic amongst supporters and how it is decided is top on the list of ' @entity233 ' on the @entity6 website			1
explaining the process , @entity40 said : ' at the start of the week the editor will have a plan of how he expects it to pan out and the length of each individual match to make sure you can fit it in that @entity245 slot			0
then it 's constantly changing			0
' at half - time you 'll perhaps have another look , and then at full - time			0
there 's also the added complication of a 5.30pm game most saturdays so you 'll have a plan and then it can be thrown out of the window by what happens in that game			0
' it 's a collective operation but essentially it 's the editor 's decision , so he 'll make that decision after talking to the presenter , the pundits , some of the match directors			0
@entity263 and @entity153 have topped the @entity6 bill on six occasions between them this term @entity25 , in action during their recent win over @entity26 , have featured first on just two occasions ' what you 're trying to look at in a nutshell is what game do people sat at home at 10.30pm on a saturday night want to watch most ? ' there 's a combination of factors that go into that			1
people want to see the teams at the top , there 's interest in relegation battles , but also what the game 's been like			0
goals do have a massive impact in where you are in the running order for @entity6			0
' the rise of social media has enabled fans to interact directly with the programme , its main presenter , @entity30 , and pundits			0
the running order is now announced on @entity302 ahead of the programme on a saturday evening and flagged up throughout the broadcast			0
@entity40 said : ' certainly the advent of @entity302 and social media has made it even more hotly contested and fans are n't backward in coming forward to let us know their views			0
@entity13 , 13th in the @entity58 table , have been last on @entity6 five times @entity313 celebrating for @entity84 against @entity153 in september			0
the @entity169 have never been on first this year ' but all we try and do is be honest and say that we 're looking at it from people at home 's point of view and what games they want to watch			0
' we think it 's important we take each programme on its merits			0
across the course of the season , each team should have their time in the spotlight , certainly if they score some goals			0
last season 19 out of the 20 clubs led the programme , and this season 18 have halfway through it			0
' it 's great to have people talking about your programme and we love social media			0
you have got to be careful not to take some of the comments personally			0
' @entity6 is an institution and it 's absolutely phenomenal the way people still watch a highlights programme			0
it 's when people are n't talking about you that you get worried			0
' @entity26 have been on first the second-most times ( five ) and have appeared in the top three games more than any other side - 15 times in total to @entity61 's 13			1
