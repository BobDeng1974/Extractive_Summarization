@entity2 director - designate @entity1 's vigorous defense of drone strikes to kill terror suspects - even @entity5 citizens - overseas is causing lawmakers to consider lifting secrecy from the drone program and push to regulate its use			1
@entity1 , president @entity11 's top counter terror adviser , was grilled for more than three hours thursday before the @entity12 on the drone program he leads and on leaks of classified information to the media , which @entity1 vehemently denied being a part of			1
despite @entity1 's wide - ranging testimony and the @entity21 's release of a top secret memo explaining its legal rationale for the strikes just hours before the confirmation hearing began , some senators afterward said it was time to bring the drone program into the open			1
' nothing could be further from the truth , ' he declared			0
referring to one @entity5 citizen killed by a drone in @entity52 in 2011 , he said @entity53 had ties to at least three attacks planned or carried out on @entity5 soil			1
they included the @entity58 , @entity59 , shooting that claimed 13 lives in 2009 , a failed attempt to down a @entity64 - bound airliner the same year and a thwarted plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010			0
' he was intimately involved in activities to kill innocent men women and children , mostly @entity5 , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity71 message : a secret drone report was shared with the @entity73 at the hearing following a leak earlier this week after the hearing the committee 's chairwoman , @entity77 @entity76 said she wanted to make the program more open to the public so @entity5 officials can acknowledge the strikes and correct ' exaggerated ' reports of civilian casualties			1
@entity76 said she and other senators were considering legislation to set up a special court system to regulate drone strikes , similar to the one that signs off on government surveillance in espionage and terrorism cases			1
@entity1 said drones are only used on targets planning attacks on the @entity5 - never as retribution speaking with uncharacteristic openness about the classified program , @entity76 said the @entity2 had allowed her staff to make more than 30 visits to the agency 's northern @entity106 headquarters to monitor strikes but that such transparency needed to be increased			1
her comments came after the @entity21 , under pressure from the committee , gave senators on the panel a @entity116 memo outlining the legal justification for drone strikes			2
but senators complained that their staff was n't allowed to see it			0
' i think the process set up internally is a solid process , ' @entity76 said of the methods used to decide when to launch drones and against whom , but added : ' i think there 's an absence of knowing exactly who is responsible for what decision			1
so i think we need to look at this whole process and figure a way to make it transparent and identifiable			0
' @entity136 rep. @entity135 , a member of the @entity137 , said his panel also had been looking at establishing a ' court - like entity ' to review the strikes			0
' i think the @entity21 and @entity12 ought to put their heads together and come up with some way to require either initially or after the fact , a review of an operation when it takes the life of an @entity5 citizen , ' mr @entity135 said			0
under oath : the hearings were watched even more closely because of the recently - leaked memo about the use of drones , as @entity1 is thought to have been the ' architect ' of the program next step : @entity1 is a veteran of more than three decades in intelligence work , and most recently served as @entity11 's top counter-terrorism adviser in the @entity21 in a long afternoon in the witness chair , @entity1 was questioned on other issues , such as the use of waterboarding and other interrogation techniques in the @entity165 administration			1
he declined to say whether he believes waterboarding , which simulates drowning , amounted to torture , but he said firmly it was ' something that is reprehensible and should never be done again			0
' @entity1 , 57 , is a veteran of more than three decades in intelligence work			1
he withdrew his name from nomination to head the @entity2 four years ago amid questions about the role he played at the @entity2 when the @entity165 administration approved waterboarding and other forms of ' enhanced interrogation ' of suspected terrorists			0
more common : fewer than 50 strikes took place during the @entity165 administration while more than 360 strikes have been launched under @entity11 on the question of waterboarding , @entity1 said that while serving as a deputy manager at the @entity2 during the @entity165 administration , he was told such interrogation methods produced ' valuable information			2
' targets : strikes are carried out in @entity52 , where three @entity5 citizens with @entity192 connections have been killed including @entity53 ( pictured in 2008 ) now , after reading a 300 - page summary of a 6,000 - page report on @entity2 interrogation and detention policies , he said he does ' not know what the truth is			2
' @entity1 bristled once when he was questioned about leaks to the media about an @entity192 plot to detonate a new type of underwear bomb on a @entity206 airline			2
@entity208 @entity77 @entity207 accused him of having leaked classified information in a telephone call with former government officials who were preparing to make television appearances to explain the plot			2
' i disagree with that vehemently , ' the nominee shot back			0
on may 7 of last year the @entity2 thwarted an ambitious plot by @entity192 's affiliate in @entity52 to destroy a @entity5 - bound airliner , using a bomb with a sophisticated new design			0
the bombing would have taken place near the anniversary of the killing by @entity225 of @entity226			0
the next day , the @entity227 and the @entity228 reported that the would - be bomber was cooperating with @entity5 authorities			0
time to talk : the hearing was led by senator @entity76 ( right ) and @entity1 ( left ) had to answer legal questions about the use of drones @entity207 and @entity77 @entity235 of @entity236 were among those who contended @entity1 inadvertently had revealed that the @entity5 had a spy inside @entity52 's @entity192 branch when , hours after the first report appeared , he told a group of media consultants ' there was no active threat during the @entity226 anniversary because ... we had inside control of the plot			1
' @entity1 won praise from several members of the committee as the day 's proceedings drew to a close			2
' i think you 're the guy for the job , and the only guy for the job , ' said @entity77 @entity259			2
the panel will meet in closed session next week to discuss classified material .			0

adviser @entity1 said drones only used on targets planning attacks
