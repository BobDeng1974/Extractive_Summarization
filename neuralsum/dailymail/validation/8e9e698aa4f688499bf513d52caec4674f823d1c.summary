a former @entity0 saved by hero pilot @entity1 after getting lost while on a camping trip has told the injured star : ' get better soon , my family is thinking of you			1
' @entity7 says @entity8 is a ' genuine hero ' after saving his life in a dramatic helicopter rescue back in 2001			1
@entity7 was just 13 when he lost the trail during a boy scout camp in a remote forest just south of @entity16 's @entity15			1
he was missing for almost 19 hours and helicopter pilot @entity8 â€“ who lived part - time in @entity19 , @entity16 at the time - joined a massive search - and - rescue mission to find him			1
he shone his belt to flag @entity8 down ' genuine hero ' : @entity7 , now 26 and married with a son , hails the @entity35 actor as a real life star @entity7 , now 26 , recalls : ' we had just got to the camp and started unloading and i started to follow somebody who i thought was my dad			1
' i lost track of him and before i knew it i was completely lost			2
' i was just 13 , i was pretty scared			2
i stayed where i was for about half - an - hour but no one came , so i started wandering , then i got really lost			1
' i was missing overnight , it had rained and snowed that day so it was freezing cold			0
' i was soggy , tired and hungry			0
i found a cave to take shelter and curled in to a ball			1
' i was so tired i slept on and off			0
' @entity7 said he prayed to be rescued and was was only comforted by his religious beliefs			1
' in the night i guess i had an epiphany or whatever you want to call it and the next morning i knew where i needed to go , ' he said			0
' i walked for a good few miles before i started hearing the search planes			2
i found a clearing next to a steep rocky outcrop and started making my way up			0
he was able to find a cave to sleep in and navigate himself but eventually , @entity7 was stuck and afraid ' i was about to start climbing it and that 's when i saw the chopper			1
' @entity7 had seen @entity8 's helicopter circling above him but then suddenly the aircraft vanished from view			1
' i had a @entity0 belt on which had a shiny brass buckle and i used it to reflect the sunlight to get their attention , ' he said			1
' i was definitely glad of my boy scout training at that point , but then the chopper passed over and had gone			2
' i thought they had n't seen me , i felt terrible and got a little depressed			0
' luckily for @entity7 , @entity1 had spotted the teen and had set down his helicopter on the crest of a nearby hill			1
@entity7 recalled : ' this guy came down and was shouting my name			2
' i was so relieved , he said , " we 're here to get you , but you 'll never guess who 's flying the helicopter ? " ' in my mind i was like , " i really do n't care " , i just wanted to get out of there			0
' but he said it was @entity1 and i did n't believe him			2
' @entity7 said he did n't realize the rescuer was telling the truth until he got in to the back of the chopper			1
' the pilot turned round and said , " good morning "			0
' the way he said it reminded me so much of his role of @entity100 in @entity35			0
then i was like , " oh my @entity102 , @entity101 has just rescued me , how cool is that "			1
' i thought i was delirious at first but then realized i was n't dreaming			0
' @entity1 flew the boy to a make - shift search and rescue headquarters that had been set up in the area			1
' they said the camp was a mile - and - a - half from where i was so i was walking in the right direction , ' he said			0
' when we landed @entity1 came over to me and said : " boy , you sure must have earned a merit badge for this one			1
" ' but i told him i 'd already earned this badge last summer , and he laughed			0
@entity117 flyer : @entity1 , 72 , has been a trained pilot for more than two decades and has a bevvy of aircraft here he is pictured on an airfield surveying the fare			2
@entity7 said he looked like @entity100 in the driving seat crash : on thursday afternoon , @entity8 crash - landed his vintage spitfire on a @entity128 golf course handled : experts hailed the landing as ' perfectly executed ' as it was his only option when the engine failed ' he had always been somebody i looked up to and appreciated			1
' and what he did gave me a different perspective on stars			0
they sometimes get portrayed as snobby people , but there really is good , generous people out there			0
' and to me @entity1 is one of those good people who we 're lucky to have as an influence on our lives			2
' at the time @entity7 recalls @entity8 being interviewed about the rescue and the @entity147 actor said : ' i 'm gon na fly anyway so i met as well fly search and rescue and help people			1
' then @entity151 sheriff @entity150 said @entity8 's volunteer efforts saved the department $ 1,000 an hour , the amount it would have cost to hire a private pilot			2
@entity7 admitted he was a little embarrassed by the incident but added that he was very popular with the kids on camp when they found out who rescued him			1
he said : ' the kids asked if i got an autograph but i told them , ' no , but i got a hug and a handshake , and that 's better '			0
these days @entity7 , who lives with wife @entity164 and their 16 - month - old son @entity165 in @entity167 , @entity168 , works for a medical company making filters for dialysis machines			1
life imitating art : @entity8 is perhaps best - known for his role as inter-galactic pilot @entity100 in @entity35 in the role , played alongside @entity175 and @entity176 , he flew the fictional @entity178 aircraft he said that when he heard the news that @entity1 had crashed his vintage plane in @entity181 , @entity182 and had been injured , he was ' shocked ' and ' genuinely concerned '			1
' this guy saved my life , the first thing i thought is ' is he alright ' , ' @entity7 said			2
' i appreciated what he did for me all those years ago and i just hope he gets better and can help other people in future			0
' he 's a genuine hero , not just in the films , he 's a great man			0
' it 's not the only time @entity8 has been involved in a dramatic rescue			2
in july , 2000 the actor rescued @entity194 , 20 , after she got in to difficulties on @entity196 in @entity16			0
@entity197 and her friend @entity198 , 22 , were on a five - hour climb of the 11,106 - ft mountain on july 31 when heat , altitude and dehydration left @entity197 sick and unable to take more than a couple steps			0
after another hiker called for help on a cell phone , the @entity35 star took to the air			0
@entity8 landed his helicopter in a meadow and picked up @entity197 ; @entity198 was told there was n't enough room and had to hike down			1
' he was wearing a t - shirt and a cowboy hat , ' @entity197 told @entity217			0
' he did n't look like i 'd ever seen him before			0
' the ailing @entity197 vomited into the hat with about a minute to go before landing at @entity19 's @entity219			0
' i ca n't believe i barfed in @entity1 's helicopter , ' she said .			2
