by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 25 march 2013 @entity1 was not notified by casualty officers after her wife was killed in a suicide bombing in @entity5 , despite the fact that they were married			1
because federal law defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman , the military did not recognize the relationship of @entity15 sgt. @entity14 and @entity1 at all , rendering @entity1 ineligible for the most basic survivor benefits , from return of the wedding ring recovered from the body to a monthly indemnity payment of $ 1,215			1
' you can not imagine the pain , to actually be shut out , ' said @entity23 , an @entity15 staff sergeant who survived five bomb explosions during a 15 - month tour in @entity26			2
' not only is one of their soldiers being disrespected			0
two of them are being disrespected			0
line of duty : army sgt. @entity14 was killed in @entity5 in 2012 in a suicide bombing if the high court strikes down the @entity52 , the ruling could bring sweeping changes to the way the military treats widows and widowers such as @entity23 , the first person to lose a same - sex spouse to war since ' @entity80 ' was lifted in 2011			1
although they can now serve openly , gay and lesbian service members ' are anything but equal , and it 's the doma that is really what 's standing in the way , ' said @entity88 , a @entity89 graduate who serves as executive director of @entity91 , an advocacy group for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender service members and veterans that filed a brief urging the court to strike down the law			0
on the other side stands the @entity101 , an association of faith groups that screen chaplains for military service			0
it has asked justices to uphold the @entity52 on the grounds that pastors and service members from religions that oppose homosexuality would find their voices silenced and their opportunities for advancement limited			2
' the military has no tolerance for racists , so service members who are openly racist are not service members for long , ' the alliance 's brief states			0
' and if the traditional religious views on marriage and family become the constitutional equivalent of racism , the many service members whose traditional religious beliefs shape their lives will be forced out of the military			2
' retired col. @entity129 , the group 's executive director , said @entity131 could find ways to honor war widows such as @entity23 without striking down the @entity52 , which he said had served as ' a wall ' protecting military personnel with strong religious beliefs since the ban on openly gay service members was eliminated			1
cherished : @entity1 holds a flag from a widow 's box that platoon mates of her wife prepared during the service they had for their fallen comrade before he left office in february , defense secretary @entity146 ordered the @entity15 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 to extend to same - sex partners of military personnel certain benefits not precluded by the @entity52 , including @entity155 cards giving them access to on - base services and visitation rights at military hospitals			1
some of those measures would have eased @entity23 's grief , if they had been in place earlier			0
in the future , for example , same - sex survivors of service members will be eligible to receive a deceased partner 's personal effects and to be presented with the folded flag at the funeral			1
but many of the acknowledgements available to military spouses in opposite - sex marriages remain out of reach			1
last rites : a @entity15 carry team transfers the remains of @entity15 sgt. @entity14 on october 1 , 2012 the widows of the two men who lost their lives alongside @entity1 on october 1 heard the news from an @entity15 casualty officer			1
but @entity23 , 43 , found out from her sister - in - law			1
@entity1 could not list her as primary next - of - kin since the government did not recognize their marriage			1
former rep. @entity190 , a retired @entity148 admiral who was the highest - ranking officer ever elected to @entity131 , said such inequities have implications for national security			0
many financial protections and support services are offered to military families not just out of gratitude , but so service members can focus on their jobs during dangerous deployments , @entity190 said			0
' when you step back and all of a sudden realize that a law would actually prevent , today , the spouse of somebody in our military ( being ) notified first that that solider or that sailor has been harmed or killed ... you sit back there and say , ' what 's going on ? '' he said			1
@entity23 and her wife had been together six years when they decided to get married			0
they waited until the military lifted the @entity215 ' policy and then exchanged vows last year on @entity218 in @entity219 unrecognized : the death certificate of @entity1 's wife , @entity40 , indicates single , despite them being married soon after , @entity1 volunteered for a second tour of duty , despite pleas from her wife and mother			1
' there are a handful of things you ca n't tell your heart not to do			0
one is to serve your country , and the other is not to love who you love , ' @entity23 said			0
@entity1 had been in @entity5 only a few weeks when a man wearing a vest packed with explosives drove a motorcycle into a group of soldiers on patrol in a market area in the city of @entity246			1
@entity1 was killed , along with two other members of the 514th @entity248 , a translator , six @entity5 police officers and six civilians			1
when @entity23 learned that uniformed officers were at the @entity254 home of her mother - in - law and father - in - law , she grabbed her marriage certificate and raced over there			1
@entity1 had requested that her wife be the first to hear in the event of her death , she said			1
fight for your rights : protesters camp out in front of the @entity50 hoping to get a seat in the courtroom when the high court hears the marriage equality cases referred to as prop 8 on 26 march and @entity52 on 27 march in @entity219 ' i wanted to make sure they saw my face , even if they were n't going to notify me , ' she said			2
the notification officer assured her he had planned to visit her , too			0
@entity1 's mother , @entity278 , knew how happy her daughter was to be married to @entity280 , and the fact that her daughter - in - law was not recognized as such outraged her			1
as primary next - of - kin , she made sure @entity23 was recognized as her daughter 's wife , including insisting that she be allowed to accompany a military escort with her daughter 's body			2
' they hemmed and hawed , hemmed and hawed , and i said , ' you will accept @entity1 going up there because she will be our liaison			2
she will bring our daughter home , and she will bring her wife home , ' ' @entity1 said			2
one of @entity23 's duties as the escort was to take possession of her wife 's property , including a velvet bag containing the wedding ring and @entity305 's medallion @entity1 was wearing when she was killed			2
equality : marriage equality supporters take part in a march and rally ahead of @entity50 arguments on legalizing same - sex marriage in @entity312 on march 24 she was instructed to pass them on to her mother - in - law 's casualty assistance officer			1
the night before she did , she slept with the jewelry , unsure if she would see the possessions again			0
the officer delivered them to @entity278 , who immediately gave them back to her daughter - in - law			1
' every little step was a shaky step , ' said @entity23			0
' you are definitely on uncertain ground			0
' @entity23 does not fault the @entity15			0
from the casualty officer to @entity329 commanders , everyone did ' the best they could , ' she said			0
in some instances , she was even surprised at her support			0
the condolence letter she received from president @entity334 acknowledged @entity1 as her wife			2
if the @entity52 is overturned before the one - year anniversary of the attack , @entity23 may become eligible for monthly survivor benefits , guaranteed health insurance and other financial compensation			2
' my biggest thing , honestly , is to get her death certificate changed to married , ' she said			0
' that will be my victory			0

@entity1 and @entity40 both served in the military , but marriage was not recognized
@entity40 was killed in suicide bombing and @entity1 had to hear news from sister - in - law , as military does not recognize same - sex couples
fighting for repeal of @entity52 , which recognizes marriage between only a man and a woman
