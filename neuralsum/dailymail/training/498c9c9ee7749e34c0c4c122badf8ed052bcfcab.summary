most of us enjoy a takeaway every now and again but a couple who ate them every day and piled on the pounds as a result have shed more than 13st by learning how to cook them at home			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , embarked on their bid to lose weight after being told they were too fat to have @entity13			1
now , mrs @entity14 , 30 , who once weighed 22st , is now a slimline size 12 , while her @entity17 husband has also slimmed down with the couple losing an impressive 13st combined			1
all change : at her heaviest , mrs @entity14 was a size 26 ( left ) but is now a slimline size 12 ( right ) as a result of their impressive weight loss , the pair will now start @entity13 treatment in a bid to finally have the family they have always longed for			1
' when we wanted to lose weight , we realised that we did n't know how to cook which was really embarrassing , ' explained mrs @entity14 , a children 's nanny			2
' we used to eat take - aways at least twice a week and the other days were microwave meals so it was really hard to learn			1
' i remember the first meal was a home - cooked meat kebab and we made our own chips as well			2
we were really surprised it turned out as well as it did and it tasted so lovely			0
' we cook everything together now , with the kebabs a firm favourite , and have lost 13st			1
' astonishingly , the pair 's new healthy diet is n't all salads either			2
both still enjoy full @entity50 breakfasts and roast dinners but cook them from scratch and use low - fat ingredients			1
fattening snacks such as chocolate and crisps are out and in their place , lean ham , low - fat quiche and yoghurts			1
overweight : @entity6 and @entity7 decided to lose weight after being told they were too fat to have @entity13 looking good : mrs @entity14 says learning how to cook proved crucial in their battle to lose weight what 's more , say the couple , their bid to lose weight and learn how to cook has brought them closer together as a couple - saying that they are much happier as a result			1
' it has been really supportive having @entity7 there losing weight with me , ' said mrs @entity14			1
' we 've always done everything together , but now instead of just sitting and watching a film together , we walk the dogs and cook together too			2
' every wednesday morning before i go to weigh at my @entity84 , @entity7 weighs himself first so we can do it together , and we measure our waists together too			1
' we have never been competitive and it is just a massive support going through it side by side			0
' their new look is a far cry from the heftier physiques both had at the start of their relationship			2
when the couple married in 2007 , mrs @entity14 walked down the aisle in a size 24 wedding dress			2
' i was happy at the time , ' she admits			0
' how i ate and looked was my just my life and what i knew , it did n't affect me at all			0
' but that all changed when the couple decided they wanted to start a family and discovered that their weight was playing havoc with their fertility			1
' we were back and forwards to the @entity114 as i struggled to get pregnant , ' explains mrs @entity14			0
' the doctor said my weight would be contributing to problems with fertility			0
' i was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and went on to have four miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy			0
' they said i would never be able to fall pregnant by myself naturally			0
my only hope was @entity13 treatment			2
' unfortunately for the @entity14 , the @entity126 refused to fund ivf treatment until they shed some of the weight and , desperate to have a family , the duo joined a local slimming club			1
' i had to have a @entity132 under 30 , and @entity7 under 35 , ' said mrs @entity14			1
' but me being a size 26 and @entity7 an @entity17 , we were nowhere near			1
' ' at first i was too embarrassed to go to classes so i tried to lose the weight at home			0
but over two years i only lost two and a half stone because i did n't know what i was doing			0
' i decided enough was enough and joined a @entity84			0
@entity7 works full time so i went to the class and came back to teach him what i had learned			1
' the main thing was to cook everything healthily			2
the first meal we cooked together was @entity147 meat and we made our own chips as well			0
we had never cooked before so it was really hard to start learning			1
' hopes : the newly slimline couple are now having ivf while mrs @entity14 has started her own slimming class despite being beginners in the kitchen , the couple soon realised they shared a passion for cooking and have n't looked back since			2
' we realised we both loved cooking , ' adds a delighted mrs @entity14			0
' maybe things would have been different if we had known this before			0
' in just one year i lost five and a half stone and now i am a healthy size 12 , and @entity7 lost five stone too			1
' now we cook every night together and walk our dogs together for exercise			0
it 's been great going through it together and we motivate each other to keep going			0
' we have a completely different lifestyle and eat so much healthier			0
' better still , the couple are now about to begin @entity13 treatment having reached the perfect weight , while mrs @entity14 is so enthused , she is now running her own weight loss classes			0
' it has worked wonders for us , ' she added , ' and we have never felt happier			0
' breakfast : none @entity180 : crisps , sweets , chocolate lunch : sandwich with four slices of bread , butter and cheese			0
two bags of crisps each afternoon snacks : @entity192 sized bar of chocolate , sweets , crisps dinner : large take - away with all the sides and starters supper : grab sized bag of sweets , family bar of chocolate breakfast : yogurt , fruit and a cereal bar @entity180 : fruit , yogurt , low fat quiche lunch : @entity213 ' full @entity50 ' with low fat bacon , beans , eggs , tomatoes , mushrooms , sausages and toast afternoon snacks : fruit dinner : chicken with vegetables , @entity226 pudding supper : @entity229 , sugar free jelly , fruit , @entity84 low sugar chocolate			1
