@entity0 week is traditionally a time for creepy tales , but pop star @entity2 has a real - life horror story to top the lot			1
the 30 - year - old had been bugged by a scratching noise – and when she went to the doctor ’s to get it checked out , she discovered to her shock that it was caused by a spider living inside her ear			1
even more alarmingly , it had been there for a week			2
creature discomforts : @entity2 , pictured during a concert , noticed a rustling noise after using earphones on a flight grisly proof : ms @entity2 posted this image of her unwanted guest after it had been ' hoovered ' out of her ear by a hearing specialist @entity2 – who once released a single called @entity25 – believes the creature had previously been living in a pair of earbud headphones she recently used			1
once the doctor had removed the creature with a suction device , ms @entity2 posted pictures of the unnerving find on @entity34			1
she wrote alongside the picture : ‘ basically i used these old in - ear monitors to block out sound on a flight , a little spider must have been in them and crawled inside my ear and stayed there for the week			1
‘ though the thing looked terrifying up - close on the doctor ’s camera , once he took him out ( using a micro-hoover ) it was pretty small , and now it ’s in this little test tube , alive and seemingly fine			0
’ and showing a surprising sang - froid , she added : ‘ it was no hassle at all , apart from the occasional shuffling noises			0
’ a spokeswoman for the star , best known for hits such as @entity56 and @entity57 , said : ‘ the ear specialist said he ’d never in his career taken out a live bug before			0
when it was out it was pretty tiny			0
‘ @entity2 kept it in the test tube and released it in her garden when she got home			1
apart from shuffling and random noises in her ear , the spider was no bother for the entire week it lived there			1
she was relieved it was what it was as she was worried she was losing her hearing			0
’ miss @entity2 told her followers on @entity77 and @entity34 about the arachnid that was removed from her ear the spider 's web singer believes the creature crawled into her ear from the headphones she was using the spider was identified as a member of the jumping spider family , which are found worldwide the spider may look small , but it caused some discomfort for the @entity56 singer the news comes two weeks after @entity91 reported how a @entity93 family found a deadly @entity95 spider delivered with bananas in their @entity98 shopping order			1
ms @entity2 ’s intruder was identified as a member of the salticidae – or jumping spider – family			1
they are common worldwide , but in @entity106 they rarely grow bigger than half an inch			0
experts were , however , divided about how the spider might have survived for so long			0
dr @entity110 , who presents the @entity112 series @entity113 , said : ‘ i have never heard of this before			0
‘ but lots of spiders do n’t need to feed as frequently as you think			0
at this time of year spiders have been eating flies and are very well fed so they can survive weeks and weeks without food			0
‘ i do n’t think there is anything in anybody ’s ear that spiders would like to feed on			0
’ but professor @entity127 , a hearing expert at @entity128 , said : ‘ spiders like nice warm and slightly moist places and the ear can provide that			2
we often have very small lice and bed mites which get into our ear which a spider could live on			2
’ but he had some relatively comforting news : ‘ eventually the spider would come out and lay its eggs in a suitable place – and i do n’t think that would be the ear			2
’ in 2012 , a woman in @entity145 discovered a spider had been living in her ear canal for five days			1
doctors retrieved it by pouring a salt solution into her ear			2
but last year sculptor @entity152 from @entity153 was n’t so lucky when doctors removed a live spider from his ear			1
the creature immediately shot up his nose and his ordeal only ended when he sneezed it out .			0
