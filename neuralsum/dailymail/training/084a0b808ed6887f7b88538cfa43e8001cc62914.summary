by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 's top criminal court has thrown out a law banning ' upskirt ' pictures - because it restricts photographers ' right to freedom of expression			2
the @entity11 struck down part of the anti- ' creepshot ' statute , which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification			1
these included revealing photos of women - often called ' upskirting ' or ' downblousing ' - that were taken without their consent			2
rejecting the law on wednesday , judge @entity23 claimed it was a violation of federal free - speech rights and a ' paternalistic ' intrusion of a person 's right to be aroused			1
rejected : @entity3 's highest criminal court has thrown out a law banning ' upskirt ' pictures - because it restricts photographers ' right to free speech and is a ' paternalistic ' intrusion of a person 's right to be aroused she said that photos - like paintings , films and books - are ' inherently expressive ' and therefore protected by the @entity43 , according to the @entity44			1
' the camera is essentially the photographer 's pen and paintbrush , ' wrote judge @entity23 in her opinion			0
' a person 's purposeful creation of photographs and visual recordings is entitled to the same @entity43 protection as the photographs and visual recordings themselves			0
' under the 8 - 1 ruling , which supported a previous decision made at the 4th @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity59 could take surreptitious images for arousal or sexual gratification			1

' case : the @entity76 ( pictured ) struck down part of the anti- ' creepshot ' statute , which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification the appeal , which questioned why some free speech can be treated as unlawful behavior while others are not , stemmed from a case involving a man charged with improper photography in 2011			1
@entity93 , in his early fifties , was charged with 26 counts of improper photography after taking underwater pictures of children , aged 3 - 11 , dressed in swimsuits at a @entity99 water park			1
prosecutors claimed that the constitutional right to free speech , including taking public photographs , should not be a cover behind which lawbreakers can hide			2
but @entity93 's attorneys claimed the statute did not distinguish ' upskirt ' photography from ' merely photographing a girl in a skirt walking down the street ' , meaning it could criminalise paparazzi journalists , arts patrons , pep rally attendees and ' even the harmless eccentric '			0
@entity115 : rejecting the statute , judge @entity23 said that photos - like paintings , films and books - are ' inherently experessive ' and therefore protected by the @entity43 judge @entity23 appeared to agree , saying : ' protecting someone who appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be the sort of " paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant 's mind " that the @entity43 was designed to guard against			1
' but she added : ' we also keep in mind the @entity132 â€™s admonition that the forms of speech that are exempt from 1st amendment protection are limited , and we should not be quick to recognize new categories of unprotected expression			0
' she also admitted that ' upskirt ' - type images are intolerable invasions of a person 's privacy			0
during the past 13 years , at least 151 inappropriate photography cases have been filed in @entity144			0
