at the meeting in @entity3 between @entity4 and @entity5 in the summer of 2012 , the former @entity1 coach made it clear that he craved stability			1
@entity5 ’s track record with managers had not been good , dispensing with @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 when he raged against results			2
sensibly , @entity4 approached with caution			0
at @entity1 , his relationship with successive presidents , @entity20 and @entity21 , had fluctuated wildly during @entity4 ’s hugely successful spell as head coach			0
@entity4 , the @entity24 coach , craves stability and chooses his clubs based on such assurances @entity24 's dominance of the @entity30 domestic scene means @entity4 may be tempted by a move this summer @entity33 's position at @entity34 is under threat as they fight for fourth place @entity5 had been seduced by @entity1 ’s football , the 14 titles that the club won during @entity4 ’s four years in charge before he took off to @entity42 with his family for a year - long sabbatical			1
@entity46 ’s inner circle believed they had finally landed their man and @entity5 began recruiting players in anticipation of his arrival			1
@entity51 arrived from @entity52 for £ 32m and @entity53 from @entity54 for £ 25m			0
@entity55 , a £ 7m capture from @entity57 , was another gamble			0
then @entity5 blew the deal by firing his @entity61 - winning coach the morning after a catastrophic 3 - 0 defeat in @entity63 against @entity65 ’s @entity64			2
it turned out to be a painful lesson			0
@entity4 was spooked , pulling out of the deal to become @entity46 ’s next manager the following day and decided instead to succeed @entity70 at @entity24			1
@entity46 owner @entity5 believed he had landed @entity4 in the summer of 2012 - but the then - @entity1 coach was spooked by the @entity73 's habit of hiring and firing managers expecting @entity4 to arrive , @entity5 recruited the likes of @entity51 ( right ) for £ 32m @entity4 opted to join @entity24 instead and has maintained their dominance in the @entity77 @entity1 @entity78 2008 - 09 , 2009 - 10 , 2010 - 11 @entity79 2008 - 09 , 2011 - 12 @entity80 2009 , 2010 , 2011 @entity61 2008 - 09 , 2010 - 11 @entity81 2009 , 2011 @entity82 2009 , 2011 @entity24 @entity77 2013 - 14 @entity83 2013 - 14 @entity81 2013 @entity82 2013 this is precisely the scenario that is facing @entity34 as they weigh up what on earth they are going to do with a coach who can no longer motivate his players			1
it is an open secret that @entity34 want @entity4 to become their next manager , but the indications are that he will not be ready to leave @entity24 until 2016 , when his three - year contract expires , at the very earliest			1
to wait 12 months or more for a manager who will have the top clubs in the @entity96 falling at his feet when he announces that he will leave the @entity98 is a dangerous position to be in			0
timing , as ever , is everything			0
according to the inside story on @entity4 ’s first season at @entity24 , there is an anecdote in the book @entity106 that indicates that he could see himself one day managing @entity107			1
in the same book @entity4 also discloses that @entity109 , the former @entity1 winger who now works at @entity34 as the sporting director , also approached him in the summer of 2012			1
to appeal to @entity4 , he demands stability because he knows the training facilities , the stadium , the support and the financial power , through television rights , commercial arrangements and ticketing , is already in place			2
to fire @entity33 with six games left of the @entity96 season would be an admission by @entity34 ’s owners that anything other than the @entity96 trophy or the @entity61 warrants a dismissal			1
@entity34 's place in the @entity96 top four is under threat from @entity130 and @entity131 @entity34 slipped to a 4 - 2 loss to @entity107 at @entity133 on sunday , leaving them in fourth place @entity33 guided @entity34 to the @entity96 trophy last season but they 've fallen well short this time that was @entity46 ’s game before @entity11 returned , via spells at @entity141 and @entity142 , and they lost a lot of goodwill over it			1
@entity34 felt a mild tremor too when word got out that they were about to fire @entity148 , the manager who led them to their first @entity96 title , on the eve of the @entity153 final against @entity154			2
after that , @entity34 vowed to be different			0
after meekly surrendering their @entity96 title and being given another chasing by @entity1 over two legs in the @entity61 , it is clear that @entity34 have failed to make significant progress under @entity33			1
the concern now , especially after @entity130 ’s 2 - 0 victory over @entity162 on monday evening , is that the club could yet fall out of the top four			0
even though @entity34 appear to have a favourable run - in against @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 before the final game of the season against @entity131 , there is a contingency plan open to them			0
@entity4 holds the @entity61 after @entity1 's 3 - 1 win over @entity107 in the 2011 final @entity4 is thrown in the air by his @entity1 players after their 2009 @entity61 win @entity182 , currently in charge of @entity34 's @entity181 , could take charge until may @entity182 , currently in charge of @entity34 ’s @entity181 , has the respect of the first - team players and could yet be parachuted in to see the season through			1
the difficulty beyond that scenario is what to do beyond the end of the season because a club with @entity34 ’s ambitions can not limp on for another 12 months in the hope that @entity4 becomes available			2
he demands consistency , a stable environment to allow him to work with his players on the training ground , preparing for a match every three days			0
that is the cycle for @entity4 at @entity24 , picking the bones out of their 3 - 0 victory over @entity204 at the weekend before moving on to the @entity61 quarter - final against @entity206 in @entity207 do @entity208			2
he is always looking ahead , much like the chess grandmaster @entity209 after they became friends during @entity4 ’s year in @entity42			0
for @entity34 , it is down to them to make the next move .			0

@entity46 owner @entity5 believed he had @entity4 in 2012
but the @entity216 was spooked by @entity5 's regular hiring and firing
@entity4 craves the stability he has found at @entity24
and he will seek similar assurances should he join @entity34
@entity33 's time at the @entity225 appears to be drawing to a close
city are *clinging* on to fourth spot in @entity230
