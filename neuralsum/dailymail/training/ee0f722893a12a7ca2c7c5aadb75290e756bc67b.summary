by @entity0 online matchmaking , singles ' nights , speed dating , dating apps , blind dates ... when did finding love become such an almighty palaver ? would n't it be easier if you could just spot the nearest singleton a mile off ? or , at least , some 10 metres off ? perhaps if they were wearing , say , a recognisable ' i 'm free ! ' wristband ? it may sound preposterous , but that 's precisely the thinking behind a new loved - up start - up powered by @entity21 - @entity20 couple @entity19 and @entity22 , whose whirlwind romance and continued relationship inspired the @entity26 - named my after the partners ' surnames - a coloured rubber bracelet with which they hope to unite singles all over the world			1
the new @entity26 bracelet aims to take some of the complication out of looking for love , enabling singletons to easily spot each other the @entity20 - @entity21 collaboration behind @entity26 recognised the difficulty in meeting other singles and set about creating a single identifier that would appeal to the mass market launching now in the @entity20 and in @entity43 in a few weeks , @entity19 and @entity22 say the band should help ' increase new encounters , lower the fear of first introductions , and suit busy modern lifestyles '			1
claiming the bands could ' change the face of dating forever ' , they continue : ' the launch of @entity26 is a revolutionary concept			1
when worn , the band visibly identifies that the wearer is single , just like a wedding ring shows you are married			0
' @entity26 not only impresses upon others that there is so much choice out there , but also where that choice lies			2
' the couple say they recognised the difficulty in meeting other singles and set about ' creating a single identifier that would appeal to the mass market '			0
the silicone wristbands , priced £ 6 for one or £ 10 for two , are designed in seven different colours and embossed with the words fate , destiny and future			1
speaking to @entity72 , @entity22 said : ' we recognised that as the population of single adults continues to rise across every age group , they need new and innovative ways to connect			2
' online dating provides one method but can not measure chemistry and it does n’t help when you are out and about , which is of course most of the day			0
' whilst working at my previous office of 3,500 people , i realised that i saw hundreds of people each day that could potentially be a suitable partner , yet there was no way of knowing their relationship status			0
' the new colourful wristbands enable you to identify a potential date 's availability without having to ask @entity22 and @entity98 met on holiday in @entity100 , and their relationship is now both personal and professional the couple talked about how lucky they had been to bump into each other on holiday in @entity100 , but and ' how so many people must miss out on meeting their soul mate by not saying the first hi '			1
@entity22 continued : ' we began to question the laid back approach to meeting other singes that most of us take and decided that a single identifier would be of huge benefit to singles			0
' the couple built the website @entity120 to promote @entity26 but also to provide a central resource for single people			1
' there 's a tendency to think of the notion " single and alone " , yet we want to promote " single and together "			0
' there are literally hundreds of millions of singles , yet finding one for you has always been comparable to a needle in a haystack			0
' yet it was always going to be hard when single , as a relationship status , is visually completely invisible			0
' with @entity26 you do n’t have to go looking for single hot - spots , just wear the attractive band and your perfect partner could be just around the next corner			2
' would you wear one ? the bands come in a range of colours , are embossed with the words fate , future or destiny , and cost £ 6 for one or £ 10 for two			1
