by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 12:26 est , 14 may 2012 it 's a landscape picture so spectacularly beautiful many cynics will suspect it has come from computer photo - wizardry			1
but the photographer who captured this stunning vista of the orange sun splashed gloriously across a mountaintop claims the amazing view was all natural			1
@entity10 saw the awe - inspiring scene during a sunrise over @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , at the exact moment the peak was bathed in orange sunlight			1
sunrise spectacular : @entity10 captured this picturesque scene in @entity15 when early morning sun bathed orange light over @entity13 mr @entity10 said a combination of the sun 's warm glow , along with the reddish brown of @entity13 's sedimentary rock , helped create the unique early morning landscape			1
the 47 - year - old also points out that evergreen trees in the left corner of the picture are also turning red at the sun - shade boundary			1
and he insists that , although many may suspect otherwise , the incredible image did not receive any @entity37 treatment			2
mr @entity10 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ' the morning started out pretty stormy and cloudy , which can be magical , as in this case , or a real dud			1
' it can be hit or miss , which is why a photographer must consistently make the effort to be at a location and ready			2
the before shot : this image shows what @entity50 in @entity14 looks like under more usual circumstances ' i feel i was rewarded for the dozens of early mornings i 've had that produced no images			2
i could see that the clouds were breaking up and that the lake was still , so my hopes were rising			0
' i kept looking behind me , checking for a hole in the eastern horizon that the sun might break through			0
' what is unusual about this shot is that the sun managed to find its way through clouds to illuminate @entity13 , but little else			0
' i could n't see the cloud break where the sun came from , but was certainly glad it made it through			0
' normally , i would have expected and hoped that the clouds and surrounding peaks would turn the same brilliant orange but that never happened			0
' the peak glowed for maybe a couple of minutes , and then the sky fizzled to grey			0
in the end , this is what makes the shot unique since the peak stands out from the rest of the landscape and becomes a real focal point			0
