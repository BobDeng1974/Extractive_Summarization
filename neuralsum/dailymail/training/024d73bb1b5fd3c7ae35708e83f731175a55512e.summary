it was on september 5th 2012 that @entity41 engineer @entity39 , 50 , and his wife , @entity43 , 47 , died alongside her mother , @entity44 , 74			2
all suffered bullet wounds to the head as they sat in a @entity48 estate car , following an attack by a mystery gunman shooting outside , and at close range			1
the killer , who has never been found , also murdered a @entity8 cyclist called @entity54 , 45 , whose body was found next to the estate car			1
it still had its engine running when the bodies were found by a @entity18 cyclist soon after the killings			2
the @entity63 ’s daughters , @entity64 , seven at the time , and @entity66 , four , survived the savage attack close to @entity68			1
@entity69 , who is leading the investigation into the so - called @entity71 , has now been tasked with the @entity25 killing , which police are certain was a ' murder '			2
mr @entity0 was found along an @entity76 road near @entity25 , 50 miles from where the @entity63 family were found in their car near @entity80 while refusing to discuss a possible link between the two , mr @entity69 said : ‘ it seems that he was killed by a shotgun after a shot at very close range			1
' the van he was driving was stopped in the middle lane , and partially blocking the road			0
the victim had a face wound			0
’ he said the arrested man was not a formal suspect , but ‘ someone who had a severe dispute with the victim , in relation to the hunt			2
he had issues with the victim , and because he died , we had no choice but to talk to the suspect , but do n’t get carried away			0
’ mr @entity69 said mr @entity0 came from nearby @entity105 , and was a ‘ popular member of the community ’			1
an autopsy was due to be carried out on thursday in @entity109			0
@entity105 mayor @entity110 said mr @entity0 was a ‘ well known figure , a dynamic worker who was heavily involved in the local community			1
’ police that mr @entity0 had ‘ spoken to the attacker ’ before the shooting , which is believed to have happened overnight on tuesday to wednesday			1
mr @entity0 had a ‘ bullet in the temple , ’ said a police source			1
he said he ran a successful business specialising in painting and decorating , and was also a keen hunter			2
in september , mr @entity69 said whoever was responsible for the 2012 killings may have got away with the ‘ perfect crime ’			0
‘ the further we advance , the less conviction we have , ’ he said , saying the enquiry ‘ lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up			0
on a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track			0
’ @entity39 , 50 , his wife , @entity43 , 47 , and her mother , @entity44 , 74 , all died after being shot from close range in their car ( pictured ) two years ago			1
the gunman has never been caught mr @entity69 said that ‘ after two years ’ hundreds of people had been interviewed , thousands of documents read , and numerous forensic tests carried out ‘ but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out			2
’ conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come , mr @entity69 said : ‘ we have tried everything possible , but we ’re perhaps we ’re in the presence of the perfect crime			0
’ there have been claims that mr @entity63 was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother @entity157 , 54 , of @entity158 , @entity41			1
@entity157 was last year arrested under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence			0
investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman , and to know the local area extremely well			0
this has led to well - sourced theories that mr @entity54 , the cyclist , may have been the principal target			0
he had recently left his wife and two children two live with a multi-millioniare heiress , with whom he had just had a baby , and there were said to be tensions in the relationship			0
the 2011 killings took place in an isolated layby on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of @entity183			0
a detective involved in the case said : ' the reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence , and disappeared without trace			0
it is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved			0
