by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 03:36 est , 9 april 2013 climate change could result in flights from @entity3 to @entity4 getting much bumpier in the future			1
scientists from @entity7 and @entity9 universities have analysed supercomputer simulations of the atmospheric jet stream over the @entity12 and claim climate change will increase air turbulence			1
they found the chances of hitting significant turbulence will rise by 40 to 170 per cent by 2050 , with the likeliest outcome being a doubling of the airspace containing significant turbulence at any time			1
dr @entity29 said : ‘ most air passengers will have experienced the uncomfortable feeling of mid-flight air turbulence			2
our research suggests that we 'll be seeing the “ fasten seatbelts ” sign turned on more often in the decades ahead			0
‘ air turbulence does more than just interrupt the service of in - flight drinks			2
it injures hundreds of passengers and aircrew every year - sometimes fatally			0
it also causes delays and damages planes			0
‘ the total cost to society is about $ 150million ( £ 98million ) each year			0
any increase in turbulence would make flying more uncomfortable and increase the risk to passengers and crew			1
expectations : dr @entity29 from the @entity30 said the average strength of turbulence will rise ‘ rerouting flights to avoid stronger patches of turbulence could increase fuel consumption and emissions of atmospheric pollutants , make delays at airports more common , and ultimately push up ticket prices			1
’ ' aviation is partly responsible for changing the climate in the first place			2
it is ironic that the climate looks set to exact its revenge by creating a more turbulent atmosphere for flying ' dr @entity29 , @entity30 he added : ‘ aviation is partly responsible for changing the climate in the first place			2
it is ironic that the climate looks set to exact its revenge by creating a more turbulent atmosphere for flying			0
’ dr @entity31 said : ‘ our research focused on clear - air turbulence in winter			0
this is especially problematic to airliners , because clear - air turbulence is invisible to pilots and satellites , and winter is when it peaks			0
’ the study , called ' intensification of winter transatlantic aviation turbulence in response to climate change ' , is published today in the journal @entity93 .			1

climate change study by scientists at @entity7 and @entity9 universities
they analysed simulations of atmospheric jet stream over @entity12
chances of hitting significant turbulence will rise by 40 to 170 **%** by 2050
average strength of turbulence will also increase , by between 10 and 40 **%**
