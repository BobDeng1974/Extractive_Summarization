by @entity0 published : 14:24 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 20:02 est , 19 november 2013 binge drinking among teenagers has led to a ‘ meteoric ’ rise in alcohol - related deaths , a leading doctor warned yesterday			1
professor @entity6 said too many children were getting drunk on a regular basis – and some of them would die in their twenties as a result			1
sir @entity6 , who is the country ’s leading authority on liver disease , has called for urgent government action and accused @entity15 of backing down over minimum pricing per unit and other controls			1
under age girls @entity20 15 , ( left ) and @entity21 14 , ( right ) had no problem getting served when they took part in a bar crawl experiment ‘ it is tragic to see young people coming into hospital and dying of alcohol - related liver disease , ’ said the president of the @entity26			1
‘ liver specialists are seeing people as young as in their 20s dying due to alcohol			2
’ sir @entity6 said he was concerned by the number of people drinking while their brains were still developing : ‘ we could see up to a quarter of a million preventable deaths from liver disease in the next 20 years			2
’ speaking at a conference in @entity41 hosted by the charity alcohol concern , the professor said a recorded four-fold rise in deaths from liver disease was ‘ meteoric ’			2
@entity46 claimed 1,200 lives a year in 1970 but the toll in 2010 was 5,000 and rising			0
the @entity49 and @entity50 are the only @entity52 countries where deaths from liver diseases are on the increase			0
‘ no other disease has shown anything like this , ’ added sir @entity6			0
the conference also heard that alcohol - related admissions to @entity49 hospitals are at an all - time high of 1.2million a year			0
according to a survey carried out in 2011 , 30 per cent of girls and 25 per cent of boys reported being drunk in the previous 30 days			1

‘ i am aware that in politics there are difficult decisions and trade - offs , ’ he said			0
‘ my guess is that factors for the change of position would be pressure from the drinks industry and concerns from @entity83 that the person who is not well off and drinks responsibly would be disadvantaged			0
‘ the secretary of state , @entity87 , is not following the evidence on how we can reduce alcohol - related liver diseases in terms of availability , promotion and pricing of alcohol			1
‘ instead , regulation is getting laxer - we hear the government is considering changes to licensing laws so people can get a gin and tonic when having their hair cut			2
’ prof @entity6 said minimum prices per unit would not affect the cost of drinks in pubs or restaurants - and only mean a slight increase for moderate drinkers			2
and he said an experimental ban on bulk discounts for alcohol has seen a 4.5 per cent decrease in wine sales over 12 months to october 2012			0
as well as minimum pricing , prof @entity6 suggested district hospitals should create @entity119 to work with people admitted with drink - related conditions and help them reduce their consumption			1
