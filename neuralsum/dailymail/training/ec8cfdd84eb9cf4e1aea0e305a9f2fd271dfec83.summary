@entity1 officials are investigating the possibility that @entity4 hackers were responsible for attacking unclassified @entity6 computer systems this week , forcing tech teams to take several systems offline			1
the @entity10 administration has described the impact as an ' inconvenience , ' as staffers temporarily lost access to some digital resources			2
but the thought of a stealth cyberattack by @entity4 president @entity18 – or by his industrialist cronies – is sending shock waves through @entity21			0
@entity18 is , by all accounts , furious at the @entity1 for a regime of punishing economic sanctions designed to pressure him to disengage his military from armed conflict in @entity28			1
the @entity29 reports that @entity30 , a @entity31 cybersecurity firm , found that @entity4 hackers were behind a series of cyberattacks striking governments in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity38 , along with @entity39 and several @entity41 nations – and their militaries			0
hackers attacking the @entity6 ? it makes sense , experts say , given the havoc they could cause if they ever seized control of government computers the @entity4 also allegedly targeted the computers of journalists whose reporting focuses on issues that the @entity18 government considers top - of - mind			1
' this is no smash - and - grab , financially motivated @entity4 cybercriminal , ' @entity30 threat intelligence manager @entity56 told the @entity29			0
' this is @entity4 using their network operations to achieve their key political goals			0
' @entity6 officials have confirmed that the attack on their computer infrastructure did n't accomplish anything approaching digital vandalism			2
no data was destroyed and the intruders were more akin to peeping @entity69 than to arsonists			0
' the activity of concern is not being used to enable a destructive attack , ' @entity72 spokeswoman @entity71 told the @entity29			0
the administration wo n't directly address the possibility that @entity4 are to blame			0
' it would be unwise , i think for rather obvious reasons , for me to discuss from here what we have learned so far , ' @entity6 press secretary @entity78 told reporters wednesday during a briefing			0
' so what i can tell you as a general matter , though , is something that will not be particularly surprising to you			0
there are many people around the world who would love to gain greater insight into the activities of the @entity1 government by collecting information from the @entity6 network			1
' @entity78 also said the computer network at @entity6 is ' subject to daily cyberattacks , or at least efforts to infiltrate it			1
' ' we take these kinds of activities very seriously , ' he added			0
equally serious is the fact that a country described as a ' friendly ally ' alerted the @entity6 that its computers may be under attack			2
surveillance detection in the @entity1 government 's computer systems apparently failed			1
it 's not clear if the @entity10 administration 's unwelcome computer guests took anything , or if the foreign - government tipster was alerted by the presence of @entity1 material suddenly appearance on computer servers that typically host illicit data			1
hacker - in - chief , maybe : @entity4 president @entity18 's government is suspected of being behind repeated efforts to infiltrate the @entity10 administration 's computers another possibility is that hackers – like burglars casing a building , looking for security cameras , and casually trying to open doorknobs and windows – were trying to assess the @entity6 's capacity to protect its computer systems			1
the intruders may haev been trying ' to test what the security culture is , or to get valuable information about the security posture at the @entity6 , ' said @entity143 , a cybersecurity expert at the @entity145 consultancy			2
this week 's revelations are n't the first episode of organized , stealthy hackers from @entity4 targeting @entity1 interests			1
in 2014 @entity1 cybersecurity firms spotted a digital espionage campaign that appeared to target more than 1,000 computers at oil and gas companies in the @entity156			2
in addition to industrial secrets , experts believe the criminals were searching for a way to control the computers – and the physical systems they control – from thousands of miles away			1
they covered their tracks by encrypting their communication and disguising their location , but the @entity29 reports that small bits of russian - language code was found in streams of data they left behind , along with other telltale signs like timestamps that established when the attacks were launched – in this case , during regular working hours in @entity177 .			0

@entity6 *acknowledges* daily attempts to intrude on its computer networks
administration fears that @entity18 's government is behind one recent effort that rattled government it experts
some systems were shut down , but the @entity6 insists it was only an ' inconvenience '
hackers could be trying to assess @entity1 security *countermeasures* , steal data , or take control of computers *remotely*
