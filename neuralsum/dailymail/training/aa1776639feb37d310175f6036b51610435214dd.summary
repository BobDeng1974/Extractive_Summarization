at first glance , it may look like a log covered in insects , or even two snakes moving in tandem			2
but this wriggling mass is made up of hundreds of fungus gnat larvae , or larval @entity8 , swarming together			2
it is thought the insects travel en masse to deter predators , and those on the inside are the dominant members of the group being shielded by the lesser members			1
it is thought the insects travel en masse to put off predators and those on the outside are the dominant members of the group while they appear more conspicuous , they ‘ look hard , ’ dr @entity28 , fly curator at the @entity30 , @entity31 , told @entity34			1
‘ birds are more likely to think it ’s a snake than larvae , ’ she said			1
dr @entity38 , a biology lecturer at @entity39 explained that the insects are demonstrating ‘ the selfish herd theory ’			1
this is when individuals within a population – in this case gnat larvae - attempt to reduce the odds of being eaten by putting others of their own species between themselves and predators , resulting in an aggregation , or swarm			1
the theory was proposed by @entity53 in 1971 to explain the gregarious behaviour observed in a variety of animals , including insects , schools of fish and even herds of wildebeest			1
‘ the outer layer of larvae are more exposed than creatures towards the centre , so the less dominant ones are on the outside , ’ she said			1
the idea is that subordinate animals will be forced into higher risk positions and you can see the larvae changing places in the swarm as it wiggles along			2
it is thought that the tiny creatures signify their dominance using chemical trails , which lots of insects use to move along together			1
@entity83 , professor of ecology at @entity86 ’s @entity85 , told @entity34 : ‘ @entity87 of insects can occur around resources such as food , shelter or , in adult insects , mates			2
‘ the avoidance of predators can also cause aggregations - where the likelihood of any individual being preyed upon is reduced where the predator or swamped or affected by some consequence of group behaviour			1
’ the sight was captured at an unknown location in the @entity104 where the larvae seem to be ' walking ' along the pavement			0
while gnat larvae aggregations may seem rare , many examples have been documented in that species , and in others such as sawfly in @entity113 , where dr @entity38 said they are common			1
‘ you ’re unlikely to see them in this climate because it ’s not warm enough			0
insects are exothermic and rely on the sun to warm up , ’ she said			2
professor @entity123 , director of science at the @entity125 , said : ' there are over 400 species of fungus gnats in the @entity129 and the larvae , of some species at least , will form these swarms			2
' fungus gnats usually feed on fungi and rotting leaves , while the adults fly around houses in the summer			0
' not much is known about the larval stages or life cycles , but the normal environment for larvae and their fungus food supply , is moist			0
' if the area dries out or populations build too high , a cohesive mass may be assisted by an aggregation , ' he said			0
@entity149 of @entity150 , wrote an account of this strange sight over 50 years ago			0
he wrote : ‘ on the morning of june 15 , 1949 we witnessed a mass migration of fungus - gnat larvae in the rainforest zone of @entity157 - an island in the @entity159 - at an altitude of about 4,000ft ( 1,200 metres )			0
‘ close to a temporary shelter in which we were housed , my wife noticed a strange crawling object moving over the wet , muddy soil			0
‘ closer examination at once disclosed that this was an irregular , band - like mass of small dipterous maggots			0
’ he identified them as @entity171 or snake - worms			1
‘ … the mass of larvae was moving slowly in a very irregular band about a foot in length , less than an inch in width and layered to a depth of about half an inch			0
‘ as has been described in some previously observed cases , the individual larvae were moving on the slimy bodies of their fellows so that progression is accomplished by the forward motion of those on the top , while those at the rear , as they are uncovered , move with a sort of superficial , belt - like , rolling motion over the cramped individuals in the lower layers			0
‘ thus , the mass moves onward , but the larvae are continually changing position with reference to one another			0

it *'s* thought the insects travel en masse to deter predators
expert from @entity30 , @entity31 , said the wriggling insects look ' hard ' and snake - like to birds , which might otherwise eat them
insects are demonstrating ' the selfish herd theory ' which says that dominant creatures get the most protection on the inside of a swarm
sighting is common in some countries such as @entity113 , but unusual in the @entity129
