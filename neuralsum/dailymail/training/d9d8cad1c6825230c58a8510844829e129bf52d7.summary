by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 07:35 est , 5 february 2013 locked up : @entity2 man @entity1 , who moved to @entity3 to find work , has become one of the first men in the @entity3 to be jailed for squatting a @entity2 man who moved to @entity3 to find work has been jailed under tough new anti-squatting laws for refusing to move out of an empty house where he had been sleeping			1
former soldier @entity1 , 27 , was arrested by police after defying requests to move out of the empty property in @entity16			1
the @entity2 immigrant , who exploited @entity19 border control policies to settle in the @entity3 in 2005 only to end up homeless and an alcoholic , was prosecuted following the scrapping of squatters rights in september last year			1
at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity1 pleaded guilty to a new squatting offence and was jailed for 15 weeks			1
the court heard @entity1 was arrested on january 31 after police acting on a tip off found him inside the boarded up property in new @entity30 , @entity16 , which is empty due to renovation			1
the officers got into the house through a broken door and could see @entity1 was sleeping on a makeshift bed in a downstairs room			1
they woke him up and told him he was squatting and had to leave and was told not to return			2
but 20 minutes later police returned to check on the house and found him back inside the property lying in a drunken stupor sleeping in the same makeshift bed			1
he was arrested when he refused to leave			2
in mitigation @entity41 , defending , said @entity1 had come to the @entity3 from @entity2 in 2005			1
he got a job and everything was fine until the breakdown of his relationship			2
he returned to @entity2 ' to straighten his head ' but when he came back to @entity16 found that his former partner had started a new relationship			1
prosecuted : @entity1 defied police requests to move out of an empty house where he had been bedding down at night ' he had hoped to reconcile the relationship and was unable to cope with the situation he was faced with , ' said mr @entity41			1
' he started to drink and unfortunately the drink has taken over his life			2
he has n't caused any difficulties other than being in a property he should n't have been in			2
' @entity1 has been jailed following a successful prosecution under new squatting laws			1
previously , police could not evict squatters as soon as they moved into somebody 's property			2
so a homeowner 's main option to get them out was through a civil court order - which could be time consuming and costs many tens of thousands of pounds			0
these rules were changed and new legislation introduced in september last year			0
the new offence protects homeowners or legitimate tenants who have been excluded from their homes			2
it will also protect those who own residential buildings that they do n't live in , such as landlords , local authorities or second home owners			0
but homeless charity crisis said the new law would criminalise vulnerable people , leaving them in prison or facing a fine they can not pay			0

he said : ' i came to @entity95 with my girlfriend in 2005 but shortly after we broke up			0
i started work but with the spiralling economy , i ended up losing my job and finding myself sleeping on my friend 's sofa and drinking hard , which he did n't like			0
' i returned home to @entity2 for a short time before eventually returning to @entity16 where i found myself living on the streets			1
' i now sleep in the abandoned cars in @entity107			0
i am an alcoholic and i need alcohol to survive			0
i have recently started suffering severe fits and if i do n't drink they get worse			0
i am scared i am going to die			0
' i often drink up to six litres of @entity112 cider in a day			0
i am going into rehab			0
i do n't want to be like this anymore			0
