@entity1 manager @entity0 has insisted that he has no regrets over publicly targeting a domestic treble in his first season as @entity1 boss			1
the @entity6 has set the bar high and riled opponents by repeatedly saying he wants nothing less than a clean sweep			2
@entity12 and @entity13 are the only @entity15 managers in the club ’s history to have achieved the feat. @entity1 boss @entity0 will be hoping to get his hands on the @entity20 this weekend @entity0 believes he set his side a realistic target in trying to win a domestic treble however , @entity0 defended the treble talk , saying : ‘ what ’s the worst thing that can happen ? that you do n’t reach your goals ? ‘ i can say i am happy to win one title this year and reach a goal			1
you can say something else , but everybody knows the demands of this club			2
i have said that all season and there is so much hard work and so many games but we have a good chance to win a trophy on sunday and we have prepared for that			1
’ the accepted practice for managers is to try to remove pressure and expectation from the shoulders of their players by playing down trophy talk , but @entity0 rejects that idea completely			1
‘ i learned at @entity54 that if you say you are satisfied to be number six then you come sixth			2
‘ if you say then that you only want to get to the cup final then you lose the cup final			1
‘ you have to say you want to win the league or @entity20			1
you have to reach for something			2
it ’s in your head mentally			2
@entity13 was the last manager to win the domestic treble at @entity1 ‘ this club is so big and has such a good team that it ’s possible			1
if i did n’t think it was possible i would n’t say it			2
but i know it ’s possible and that ’s why i set high goals and make high demands			0
’ desperate to win his first trophy as @entity1 manager , @entity0 has removed a ban on his daughters attending games following some early setbacks when they attended			1
‘ i have to be fair with them			0
they were at the @entity79 game , away , standing with the supporters			0
it was a crazy experience for them			0
they just said that the supporters were crazy and they do n’t look at the football match			0
they smelled of smoke and beer			0
but they will be here on sunday			1
’ famously pictured removing his clothes on the pitch after @entity54 avoided relegation , @entity0 says he has no plans to embarrass his daughters by repeating the feat if he wins on sunday			1
‘ they are used to it			0
they ’ve seen their father doing stupid things before			0
they are 15 years old and they are probably a little embarrassed about that			0
‘ they were there when i took off my clothes after that game			0
we were sitting on the couch the day after that game , watching it on television			0
it was not a great sight			0
if we win on sunday you can expect a good celebration with the others			1
i will not take off my clothes			0
’ @entity1 ’s rearranged @entity117 fixture with @entity118 at @entity119 will now be played on april 22 , with a 7.45pm kick - off , because of the @entity15 side ’s @entity122 quarter - final replay .			1
