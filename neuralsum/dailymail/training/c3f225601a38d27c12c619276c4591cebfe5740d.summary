the @entity14 - born goal - kicker set a new individual @entity30 points record of 33 in @entity6 ' debut at his hometown @entity13 in sunday 's 48 - 16 victory over @entity35 , but is now fighting for his future			2
' absolutely @entity1 is in the mix , ' said @entity0			1
' there are a number of high - profile 10s that are available this year , and that 's all part of the bigger picture			2
' we 're hoping to be able to resolve that over the next few weeks			0
' we 're in discussions with @entity3 about moving things forward , the same as we are with a number of other players			2
' we 're certainly not far off resolving things on the recruitment front right across the board really , so certainly by the end of january things will be a lot clearer			0
