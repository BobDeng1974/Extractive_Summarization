by @entity0 after the frantic year @entity2 has gone through , it is n’t surprising he is looking forward to a much - needed beach holiday with his model girlfriend @entity4 after @entity6 ’s match against @entity7			1

shortly afterwards , he was on a plane to @entity18 for pre-season training with his new club @entity20 , who he signed for from @entity23			1
last hurrah : @entity2 ( @entity24 ) and @entity25 will play their final game of the season against @entity7 in @entity10 the end is nigh : @entity2 trains for one last game before he heads of on holiday apart from a brief spell when he was inexplicably dropped by interim head coach @entity32 at the start of the @entity34 , he has hardly missed a game for club or country since — including starting for @entity20 as they narrowly lost to @entity39 in the @entity41 play - off final two weeks ago			1
following that match , he was straight on to a flight to @entity44 from @entity45 to prepare for @entity6 ’s first match against the @entity47 in @entity48			0
an ankle injury in the first half to fellow lock @entity51 — that has ended his tour — and a lack of other second - row options on the bench meant @entity2 had no choice but to play the whole 80 minutes in the searing heat			2

‘ i have only one game left and i want to finish my season on a high with a win over @entity7 and after that i will be switching off from rugby for a while			2
triumphant : @entity2 was part of the @entity14 team that emerged victorious from @entity15 last season no cigar : @entity2 came close to winning the @entity41 play - off final with new club @entity20 ‘ i am looking forward to lying on a beach for a couple of weeks as it will be good just to shut down completely from rugby because it has been pretty full on for a year			1
‘ i had the @entity14 tour last summer , the move to @entity20 and everything that has gone in between with @entity6			1
‘ i have n’t really had a chance to reflect on it all but i will after the @entity7 game that ’s for sure			2
‘ being with @entity6 has been great because it ’s a nice way to end what ’s been an incredible year for me			0
it ’s one i wo n’t forget , that ’s for sure			0
