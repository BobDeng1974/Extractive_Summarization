by @entity1 reporter published : 13:13 est , 2 june 2012 updated : 13:36 est , 2 june 2012 @entity2 , 18 , was stabbed twice after he was attacked in @entity3 , @entity4 in 1993 a new review has been ordered into claims police corruption impeded the original @entity2 murder investigation			1
home secretary @entity9 has appointed a leading barrister to carry out an independent probe , despite @entity12 and the police watchdog , the @entity13 , concluding last week they could find no new evidence			1
@entity16 , @entity17 , who earlier this year secured the conviction of @entity2 and @entity2 for the 1993 racist gang murder , in @entity3 - 19 years after the crime - will head the review			0
the move was welcomed by @entity2 ’s mother @entity23 , who had called for a fresh public inquiry after it was claimed the @entity26 withheld paperwork about the extent of corruption from the @entity30			1
mrs @entity31 told the @entity32 : ‘ whilst i asked for a public inquiry into these allegations , my discussions with the home secretary have reassured me that the independent review she has ordered will seek to deal with my concerns			2
‘ this is because firstly , it will be conducted by someone independent of both the police and the @entity13 , organisations in which i have little faith and confidence , and secondly , the person conducting the review , @entity16 , @entity17 , is someone who has already shown his commitment in getting justice for me and my family			2
’ the scope of the inquiry and the barrister who will be in charge have not yet been decided			0
a @entity56 spokesman said : ‘ the home secretary has asked for a @entity17 - led review of the work the @entity26 has undertaken into investigating claims of corruption in the original @entity2 murder investigation			1
’ the @entity26 launched a review to examine the claims , while the @entity13 reviewed its 2006 investigation into complaints following the broadcast that year of the @entity69 programme @entity70 who killed @entity2			1
@entity31 with her son @entity72 at a memorial service last month - 19 years after @entity2 was murdered officers from the @entity26 's @entity75 looked at thousands of documents , many dating from the 1980s , from @entity26 archives and from government archives in @entity80 , and spoke to serving and retired officers as well as the junior counsel for the @entity26 at the inquiry			2
the review found that no investigations , nor the inquiry , uncovered evidence of corruption or collusion which could have hampered or influenced the original or subsequent investigations			1
it also found that the force disclosed all material relating to ‘ adverse information ’ it had about three officers of concern , including those the claims surrounded			0
there was no other material known to be held by the force which suggested that corruption or collusion impacted on the initial investigation into mr @entity2 's murder , and there are no new allegations from the recent claims , the force said			0
any allegations or suggestions had already been investigated by the @entity26 and @entity13 , it said			0
the police watchdog said its review followed reports on allegations made by former met police officer @entity117 about the relationship between former detective sergeant @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity2 's father			1
jailed : @entity2 , left , and @entity2 , right , were sentenced to life in prison for the murder of @entity2 in april 1993 but on thursday the @entity13 also said it found that no new information or evidence has been made available which would lead to a change in the conclusions reached by its original investigation into allegations made by the @entity69 documentary			0
suspicion had fallen on the conduct and integrity of former @entity26 commander @entity135 , who was involved in the original murder investigation , and his relationship with @entity138 , who was later convicted of a separate murder			1
probe : home secretary @entity9 asked for a review the @entity26 's previous investigations into corruption claims no criminal or misconduct charges were brought as a result of the internal investigation into mr @entity135 , who says he was exonerated and denies any wrongdoing			1
he was questioned at the @entity149 inquiry about corruption , but no evidence of wrongdoing was found			1
during the @entity149 inquiry , lawyers claimed @entity138 had a criminal associate , @entity120 , whose son @entity156 was a prime suspect in the murder of @entity2			0
it has also been claimed that another @entity12 officer , who interviewed the suspects following @entity2 ’s killing , had links to @entity120			2
a leaked @entity12 report alleged detective sergeant @entity119 , one of the lead investigators in the initial botched inquiry , received corrupt payments from @entity120			0
those allegations were investigated by the @entity13 which found no evidence that corruption had affected the inquiry			2
mr @entity119 , has always denied wrongdoing			0
the @entity26 investigation into @entity135 , codenamed @entity173 , began in april 1987 when he was working as the force 's head of criminal intelligence , according to the @entity177			0
it was triggered by allegations that he had taken bribes from criminals and had improper relationships with criminal informants - something he strongly denied			0
there are claims that a confidential report compiled by @entity12 's anti-corruption command was not disclosed to the panel of the 1998 @entity149 inquiry that examined the forces handling of the @entity2 case shadow home secretary @entity193 said : ‘ i believe it is right that an independent review is undertaken into allegations of corruption at the time of the original investigation into the murder of @entity2			1
‘ however i also feel that 13 years after the @entity2 we should not only confront these allegations of corruption , but publicly review progress made in eliminating racism in the police service			2
‘ it was clear before the internal review undertaken by the @entity26 into corruption and the @entity2 case that a public inquiry was needed			1
‘ so too it is clear that internal reports and work , though worthwhile , are not sufficient in such an important case			0
‘ after the history of problems in this case , everything possible should be done and be seen to be done to ensure the fullest possible confidence in the police investigations			0
