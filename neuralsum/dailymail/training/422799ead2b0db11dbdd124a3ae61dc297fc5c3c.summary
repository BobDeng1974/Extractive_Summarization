' systematic failure ' : his honour judge @entity1 found the council had unlawfully deprived the teenager of her liberty a judge has condemned a council which unlawfully took an autistic 19 - year - old woman into care for more than a year and banned her parents from seeing her alone			1
lawyers acting for the family from @entity14 , @entity15 , accused the council of committing ‘ one of the most serious cases of the deprivation of liberty ’ ever seen by a court			1
the disabled woman - known only as @entity22 - was supposed to go into respite care with @entity24 for just two weeks while her parents went on a break			1
the young woman , who can not speak , had injured herself at school three days earlier and her worried mother had alerted respite staff to self - inflicted bruising on her chest			1
but with her family out of the country , staff concluded the injury had been caused by ‘ someone or something other than herself ’ and decided to take her into care			1
her desperate parents were then banned from unsupervised contact with her and forced to battle for 14 months to get her released			1
a judge at the @entity43 has now criticised the council and ruled it acted unlawfully			0
the council has apologised but the couple are suing them for damages			0
the court heard how @entity22 was on a residential school placement before the separation , but had regular contact with her family			1
while on a school trip in may 2013 she was in an ‘ extremely distressed condition ’ after staff saw her ‘ breathing heavily and hitting herself on the sternum area ’			2
she displayed behaviour described as ‘ severely challenging behaviour ’ and had to be restrained by staff and taken home early			0
her mother noticed bruising on her chest and , after consulting her gp , took her to an arranged respite placement in @entity14 three days after the school incident			2
illegal move : lawyers acting for the family from @entity14 accused @entity24 ( whose headquarters are pictured ) of committing ' one of the most serious cases of the deprivation of liberty ' ever seen by a court despite alerting respite staff to the bruises , the teenager was taken to @entity81 within days , but staff declined to tell the doctor - dr k - about her previous incident at school			1
as a result @entity24 was called in and they decided to take @entity22 into full - time care			1
her parents returned from holiday to hear of the decision in their absence			0
but after a nine - day trial earlier this year , his honour judge @entity1 found the council had unlawfully deprived the teenager of her liberty			1
he said the lack of a ‘ proper investigation ’ showed a ‘ systematic failure ’ by the authority			0
he said : ‘ [ the doctor ’s ] report said “ the bruising is felt to be comparable with a blow or blows to @entity22 ’s anterior chest with a significant force or fall onto an object			0
‘ ” this would be an unusual injury pattern to have been self - inflicted but if this was the case then it would be expected that such self - harm , which would have been demonstrably significant and painful , would have been witnessed ”			0
‘ these are very significant words given that members of staff at the school had observed [ previously ] p breathing heavily and hitting herself on the sternum area			2
‘ this information was easily available but was never passed onto @entity122 nor was further information that on the class trip @entity22 had displayed severely challenging behaviour pulling hair , kicking seats and that staff on that trip had been " taken to the ground " by p and she had had to be restrained in the approved holds for physical restraint on the trip			0
‘ instead , at a strategy meeting , as a result of the conclusions of the medical report that it was “ highly likely that @entity22 has received a significant injury from someone or something other than herself ...			0
” so instead it was decided she would not be returned to her mother			0
’ a spokesman for the family ’s lawyers said p was now back at the family home and ‘ settling in well ’			0
she said : ‘ the council did not take account of several possible explanations for the cause of the bruising , not least the fact that she had been observed hitting herself in that area and that she had also taken a member of staff to ground whilst out on a school trip			1
‘ crucially , the young woman herself was not given the opportunity to explain how the bruising had occurred			0
’ she added : ‘ in delivering his judgement that the council had unlawfully deprived p of her liberty , his honour judge @entity1 criticised the council for its systemic failure , its corporate failings and its misguided philosophies			2
‘ the council continued to pursue an unsubstantiated case against the family , and unreasonably refused to drop allegations made against them			2
’ @entity24 said it accepted the judge ’s ruling and comments			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we were completely motivated by serious concern for the young lady ’s welfare			0
‘ we have apologised to the family for the distress that our actions caused and are working closely with them to provide the right care and support for their daughter now and in the future			1
‘ we have also taken urgent steps to ensure that all adult social care staff learn from this case and this situation never arises again			2
