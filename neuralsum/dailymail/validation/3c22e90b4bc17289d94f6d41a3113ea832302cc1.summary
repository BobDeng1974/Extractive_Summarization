standing with a @entity1 scarf in the middle of the @entity3 while thousands of @entity5 fans blast out ' @entity6 ' might strike most people as a crazy stunt to pull			1
so when a picture emerged of one brave soul appearing to do just that during sunday 's top - four clash , many @entity10 users got very excited			0
the image went viral , with even @entity16 tweeting about it after @entity1 's 2 - 1 win at @entity19			1
a @entity1 fan photoshopped into the @entity3 at @entity19 ; @entity16 even tweeted about him after the game the original picture of the @entity1 fan was taken on a pre-season tour in @entity25 in 2013 the @entity5 fans shown in the image were actually watching their team against @entity29 in 2011 @entity16 wrote : ' very happy tonight			1

a few hours later @entity43 can reveal the original picture of the @entity1 fan , taken a long way from the @entity3 , which was super-imposed into the @entity19 crowd			1
