by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 11:18 est , 21 december 2013 @entity3 : 12:47 est , 21 december 2013 web investor @entity4 has a grand vision to divide @entity7 into six new states , freeing @entity9 from the rest of the @entity11			1
the plan , which would need government approval , is to split the state into six smaller ones : @entity16 , @entity7 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity9			1
each new state would have its own government and elected officials , meaning the enclave of @entity9 would be free to achieve its techno utopia dreams			1
golden age : @entity4 wants to divide @entity7 into six smaller states as outrageous as it sounds , the plan has backing from @entity29 , the mayor of @entity9 's largest city - @entity30			1
the venture capitalist told @entity32 : ' it 's absolutely appealing to cut ourselves off from the drag of the rest of @entity7			0
' while the idea may appeal to many of @entity7 's 38 million residents , if the six - state plan were approved it would come down to government and not voters			2
' getting such a measure on @entity7 's wacky ballot will be no easy task ... attempts to get initiatives on the state ballot can cost millions of dollars , and often fail , ' @entity43 reported @entity49 as saying			0
his plan was met with a mixed reaction on @entity53 , with @entity55 founder @entity54 tweeting : ' @entity4 has idea even sillier than moon colony or seasteading			2
' @entity59 , who has worked at various web companies such as @entity53 and @entity61 , tweeted that the plan reminded him of @entity63 , a novel set in an ecologically sound future			0
and @entity66 of @entity67 tweeted : ' is @entity4 just engaging in performance art or is he just delusional ? ' co-founder of @entity70 imagined what the resulting ' utopia ' would look like , tweeting : ' and then teenagers from the various territories will fight to the death in a closed arena to win health benefits			1
' the proposal has a long way to go , although raising the funds for such a campaign would not be problematic for mr @entity4 , who just stepped down from his billionaire partnership at @entity83 , which backed more than 500 start ups including @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 electric sports cars			2
innovative : venture capitalist @entity4 says the plan will mean @entity92 have better representation dividing lines : if the plan wins approval , @entity9 will become a separate state in an email to @entity49 he said the reason for dividing the state up was so its large population had more appropriate representation in @entity103			1
he added that this would mean decisions being made by government would be more relevant to the population			0
'' this initiative encourages more competition and less monopolistic power , ' he said			0
' like all competitive systems , costs will be lower and service will be better			0
' the man behind other ground - breaking initiatives such as @entity116 in @entity117 , added : ' each new state can start fresh			0
from a new crowd - sourced state flower to a more relevant constitution			0
' mr @entity4 added that @entity121 had been backing the idea of a divide since 1859 , when ' voters overwhelmingly approved the splitting of @entity7 into two states ... but @entity127 never acted on that request			1

@entity4 puts *forward* vision to *create* smaller states with better representation
@entity134 may win support in @entity9 but it will need government approval
