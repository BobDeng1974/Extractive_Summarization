up to 3,600 mainland officers preparing to cross the @entity1 by @entity2 published : 19:47 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 19:47 est , 20 may 2013 @entity4 police guarding the @entity5 will be ‘ disguised ’ amid fears they could be targeted by @entity1 dissidents			1
extraordinary measures are being taken to protect a contingent of up to 3,600 mainland officers preparing to cross the @entity1 next month			1
@entity10 fear they could fall victim to well - armed terrorists intent on grabbing the global spotlight with a violent atrocity			0
@entity4 police guarding the @entity5 will be ' disguised ' as their @entity1 counterparts amid fears they could be targeted by @entity1 dissidents ( stock image ) as a result all officers on public order duty during the meeting of world leaders will wear boiler suits and an identical custom - made cap			1
this will mean that mainland officers are indistinguishable from their @entity1 colleagues , save for their silver collar numbers			1
the move comes as preparations to secure the two - day summit on june 17 and 18 at @entity33 golf resort near @entity34 , @entity35 , enter their final stages			0
police and the security services are staging the biggest police operation in the province ’s history because of the continued threat of a dissident attack			2
more than 8,000 officers will form a ring of steel around the remote resort , which is based on a lake peninsula , and the route from @entity50			2
the top priority of organisers is to ensure the safety of world leaders including @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 and their extensive entourages			0
but they also face a wave of potentially violent protests by a range of organisations from trade unions to anti-globalisation movements			0
the biggest protest could attract up to 20,000 demonstrators to @entity50 , including known activists from across @entity69			0
shadow demonstrations are also expected in @entity71 and @entity72 , mainly because the location of the summit is difficult to reach			0
all officers on public order duty during the meeting of world leaders will wear boiler suits and an identical custom - made cap all this takes place against the backdrop of a stubbornly volatile security situation in the province as terrorist alerts take place daily			2
some rank - and - file officers have questioned the government ’s decision to stage the summit at such short notice in @entity1			1
the estimated bill for the security operation has not been disclosed , but sources said it is likely to exceed £ 10million			0
assistant chief constable @entity96 , of the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , said a terrorist attack could take place anywhere			0
the senior officer , who is responsible for the security operation , said the @entity5 is a ‘ great opportunity ’ for dissident groups to grab attention			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve got no reason to say that dissidents wo n’t do something during that period of time			0
‘ this has been the backdrop , the sad reality of @entity1 over quite a period of time			1
there is nothing to suggest that the rhythm of that will be disrupted			0
’ officers travelling from @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 will be based at military barracks and transported in armoured @entity122 as part of the security crack - down			1
they have been issued with state - of - the - art bullet proof vests and will be accompanied by armed @entity1 colleagues			1
the travelling contingent have been told they will work under ‘ lock down ’ conditions and are not allowed to go sightseeing in their own time			2
hundreds of officers have already been trained in how to work alongside water cannon , a machine expected to be approved for us on the mainland within months			2
police commanders said mainland officers will not be deployed to ordinary incidents because of their lack of knowledge of the political make - up of the area			1
their @entity97 colleagues plan to use drones for the first time to beam down pictures to @entity150 will join two helicopters patrolling the skies between @entity50 and the summit venue			0
on the ground a huge security fence will be erected around the venue , with stores and other lower priority areas guarded by private firms			0
police in the @entity161 are also heavily involved as the extensive entourages of some countries are staying in hotels south of the border			0
the @entity1 government is passing emergency legislation to enable it to shut down mobile phone networks in a limited area to prevent signals being used to detonate a bomb			2
senior officers said the @entity173 and @entity174 ( oglaigh na @entity175 ) are the most active dissident groups with ‘ real capacity and capability ’			1
@entity179 dissidents attempted a gun and bomb attack on police in @entity50 only last thursday			0
officers in @entity1 work under constant threat of attack , with car bombs and armed ambushes a deadly reality			1
the terrorist threat level in @entity1 remains ‘ severe ’ meaning an attack is considered ‘ highly likely ’ .			1
