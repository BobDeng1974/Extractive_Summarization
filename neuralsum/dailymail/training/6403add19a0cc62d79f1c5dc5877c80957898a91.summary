detectives have been called in to investigate unexplained injuries to dementia patients at a scandal - hit care home firm			1
three elderly residents suffered the mysterious injuries before the homes were ruled unsafe and evacuated			1
@entity7 , 89 , has only weeks to live after developing an infection due to a severe bedsore that went untreated			1
@entity7 is one of three residents left with unexplained injuries after moving into the care homes being investigated by police			1
the 89 - year - old required stitches to her head and suffered horrific bruising the probe will lead to urgent questions over why patients had to endure months of appalling treatment before officials intervened			1
a damning report by the health watchdog – which could have alerted residents ’ families – was not published for eight months			1
there will also be fresh calls for a public hearing into the tragedy of an 85 - year - old man who died 48 hours after the emergency evacuations			0
his death has been shrouded in secrecy , with officials refusing to name him despite the disturbing events leading up to it			0
last night , the @entity39 watchdog was branded a ‘ disgrace ’ for not closing the homes sooner			2
families said they had long had concerns about poor care at @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48 in @entity49 , south @entity50			1
but less than a year ago , both passed inspections by the commission			0
in the case of @entity48 , inspectors did raise concerns over training and vetting of staff			2
picture of health : mrs @entity7 before she moved to the care home but this was hidden from families for eight months as the @entity39 forgot to publish it online			1
last night , mrs @entity7 ’s daughter @entity66 , 54 , said she would never have let her mother stay at @entity48 had she realised the @entity39 had already found faults with it			1
she added : ‘ the whole thing is disgraceful			0
the @entity39 and local authorities should have been more vigilant			0
‘ how many other elderly people across the country must be suffering in substandard nursing homes ? ’ @entity48 and @entity45 are both owned by @entity75 businessman @entity74 , 51 , and his wife @entity76 , 42			1
the couple , who own a £ 2million house on a gated estate in @entity80 , are believed to have raked in £ 650,000 a year from each home			2
@entity82 said the homes were run ‘ on a shoestring ’ , with poor training and a lack of equipment			2
@entity48 was criticised by @entity39 inspectors in january but this report was not published until september due to ‘ administrative error ’			1
during those eight months , mrs @entity7 and other vulnerable residents were placed at the home without their loved - ones realising there were issues			1
it was @entity97 which eventually gave the order to rescue the residents			0
@entity45 was given a clean bill of health in january last year , although families say it had been a ‘ hovel ’ for years			2
in september , staff at @entity105 asked the @entity39 to inspect it after raising concerns			0
but it took more than a month after this inspection for its evacuation to be ordered			0
on december 9 , residents were left shivering in their pyjamas as the home was suddenly closed on one of the coldest nights of the year			1
just 48 hours later , a man of 85 died			0
but the @entity47 coroner chose not to hold an inquest and his name is being kept secret			1
have you , or any of your relatives , been affected by the scandals at @entity45 and @entity48 care homes ? if so , please email news@dailymail.co.uk			1
@entity124 , 91 , who died a fortnight after being evacuated from @entity127 , will also not have her death investigated			2
but it is understood police are probing injuries suffered by @entity131 and two male @entity133 residents in their 80s and 90s			1
a @entity136 spokesman said there had been no arrests and investigations continue			0
the @entity140 is also looking at whether @entity45 staff were working here illegally			2
last month health minister @entity143 vowed to prosecute owners of homes that provided ‘ shocking ’ standards of care			2
the @entity149 were unavailable for comment			0
@entity45 ( above ) was evacuated last year after @entity105 urged an investigation into standards there a resident is stretchered out of the care home after being evacuated in the bitter cold last year bruised , malnourished and given five weeks to life : granny after two months in care home smiling for the camera and enjoying time with her family , @entity7 was a lively and happy grandmother			1
but a ten - week stay at one of @entity74 and @entity165 ’s nursing homes left the 89 - year - old malnourished , badly bruised , scarred , and with an infection that will soon kill her			0
the widow – who has been given just weeks to live – is emaciated at little more than 5st , bed - ridden , and heavily medicated with morphine to numb the pain			2
shocking : the widow has contracted a deadly infection after a bedsore went untreated while she was living at the home			0
right , she is healthy before entering its care she is one of three patients whose unexplained injuries at @entity179 in @entity49 , south - west @entity50 , are now are under investigation by police			1
her family believe her rapid decline was caused by the poor care she received at the home and branded the @entity39 ’s handling of the case a ‘ disgrace ’			2
her daughter @entity66 , 54 , told the @entity190 : ‘ to think of her suffering and in pain for those weeks is horrendous			0
' had she not gone to @entity48 she would still be getting up today and taking part in activities			2
she could have gone on for years			0
’ outraged : mrs @entity7 's daughter @entity66 says she would not have arranged for her mother to stay in @entity48 had she been aware of concerns mrs @entity7 , who has dementia and was wheelchair bound due to arthritis , was moved from a residential home to @entity48 in july when her health worsened			1
it is owned by @entity75 businessman @entity74 , 51 , and his 42 - year - old wife , who enjoyed lavish family parties in their homeland			0
according to mrs @entity7 ’s family , she was neglected from the outset and her health deteriorated rapidly , causing her to lose more than half a stone in just two months			0
her daughter said @entity48 staff did not keep records properly so she has had no explanation for how her mother came to need 12 stitches on her head and suffer severe facial bruising			1
and she says her mother now has not long left to live because of an infected bedsore on her foot that was not treated properly			0
when she was eventually taken to hospital , doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg below the knee – an operation she was unlikely to survive			0
mrs @entity66 , a book keeper from @entity226 in @entity47 , said : ‘ the home was run on a shoestring			1
i ’m surprised any residents survived			0
’ mrs @entity7 was placed there in july by @entity105 , who allegedly told the family it was the only bed they could find			0
the £ 595 - a - week cost of her stay was met by @entity237 ( @entity238 )			0
in september , @entity240 officials moved her to a different home where staff found the bedsore on her foot and sent her to @entity244 they called @entity48 staff to confront them , they were allegedly told it was ‘ not that bad ’			1
mrs @entity7 , a grandmother - of - one , worked as a cleaner until she was 70			0
a @entity47 council spokesman said when mrs @entity7 was placed in @entity48 the home had passed its most recent inspection			1
a @entity238 spokesman said she had been relocated as soon as concerns were raised .			0
