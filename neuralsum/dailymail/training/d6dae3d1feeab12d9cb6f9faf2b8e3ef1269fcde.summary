@entity4 , 36 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , spent seven weeks in the burns unit of the @entity8 after the medical accident			1
in may last year , mrs @entity4 underwent a procedure called thermal ablation - an internal gynecological procedure			1
painful : @entity13 ( left ) has lost his job and his wife @entity15 ( right ) remains in pain after the botched procedure but four minutes into the procedure , the intrauterine balloon containing a saline solution , heated to @entity21 , burst inside her , the @entity18 reported			1
there are different types of endometrial ablation but the two most common are microwave endometrial ablation and thermal balloon ablation			1
both are used to get rid of the lining of the womb			1
most commonly this is because of extremely heavy , painful periods or fibroids , non-cancerous tumours that grow on the uterus wall			0
microwave endometrial ablation uses a probe that emits microwave energy to heat up and destroy the womb lining			1

mrs @entity4 underwent the procedure at @entity83 and was under general anaesthetic during the ablation			1

a hospital report said the surgical method had been used on the @entity105 of @entity6 since 2004 without incident			0
the staff were properly trained , and testing of the machine found no faults			0
however , the report also recommended the thermal ablation system be permanently removed from the hospital			1
the @entity105 @entity114 has apologised for a ‘ catastrophic equipment failure ’ but maintains its hospital staff are ‘ competent and capable ’			0
the @entity114 's own root cause analysis report said ' immediate cooling measures were not undertaken '			0
mrs @entity4 and her husband @entity119 took legal advice before going public about her experience , and are limited in what they can say			2
but , they say they have one message that do want to make heard : ' staff should be stood down while the @entity128 is investigating			0

@entity4 , 36 , visited hospital for the routine procedure thermal ablation
involved inserting balloon filled with @entity135 water to burn womb lining
but was left scalded after balloon burst inside her during freak accident
she was then left *untreated* for internal burns by medics for five days
11 months later she remains in pain and has had 35 operations to recover
