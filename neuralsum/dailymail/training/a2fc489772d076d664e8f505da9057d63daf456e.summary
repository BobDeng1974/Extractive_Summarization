by @entity0 the world 's tallest model , @entity1 , has finally found love - and her mr @entity3 is only four inches shorter than her			1
the 34 - year - old beauty stands at a lofty 6ft 8in and completely dwarfs most men she meets			1
but now the towering brunette from @entity8 , @entity9 is in a relationship and is enjoying barely having to stoop to kiss her new man			0
@entity13 said : ' i have no problem being with a taller woman , in fact my friends are envious of my girlfriend			1
' the pair met when @entity13 started working as @entity1 's accountant and they hit it off straight away			1
@entity1 , also known as @entity40 said : ' the first time i met @entity13 we were going over some tax preparation , not the most romantic encounter , but then when i heard him speak @entity45 i just fell head over heels			1
i remembered the time i was all alone in @entity48 and wished i had a boyfriend			2
he 's not like any other man i 've dated			2
' @entity13 , who began his accounting business 1993 says : ' eve is a tender loving companion to me			1
she sometimes complains about her height from time to time , but i know she enjoys being tall			0
' she likes to live out a superhero fantasy , imagining herself as wearing a costume , riding the world of evil with her brains , martial arts and sense of justice as her only weapons			0
' my nickname for @entity53 is " @entity67 " as to me , she represents the statue @entity68 in the @entity69 in @entity48			0
' eve is very spontaneous and energetic , i love her for who she is and i always look forward to the next time we are together			2
' despite having thousands of admirers , @entity1 's longest relationship before @entity13 had lasted just six months as she struggled to find @entity77 right			1
although @entity13 is four inches shorter than her , @entity40 says that her difficult dating experience has taught her to be open to different possibilities ' i 've dated men of all sizes , even a 5ft comedian , ' said @entity40 , who started modelling four years ago after appearing on the front cover of @entity85 magazine			1
' but the short men i dated saw me as a replacement for their mother and the few taller men i 've dated were either too old , not available , too boring or struggled to cope with the fact i could look them directly in the eye			1
' i did worry i 'd never find true love			1
' eve has also worked as a personal trainer , paralegal and political lobbyist , and now the full time model and actress also makes money by charging $ 400 an hour for men to wrestle her			2
although she says that she lets @entity13 wrestle her for free , even sometimes letting him win			1
@entity13 says : ' i love to challenge @entity53 to a game of table tennis , i always beat her , but there is always the thought at the back of my mind that she could throw the bat at me at any time			1
@entity40 used to worry her height meant she would never find love , but is happy with @entity13 who she met when he was her accountant gushing over her new man , she said : ' @entity13 is very personable and kind hearted			1
' he knows when i 've had a tough day or i 'm under a deadline and he manages to ease my mind with a well timed back rub			0
' i used to have a long list of wants in a man , but my dating experience has taught me to be open to different kinds of possibilities			0
if there 's no chemistry then it wo n't work			0
' guys forget that @entity1 is an alter ego i play in the entertainment biz			2
guys who approach me with a focus to be with me because of my height tend to see me only as a fetish object - albeit just a surface attraction			0
@entity40 says that being introduced to fitness training by a previous boyfriend gave her body confidence ' @entity13 is shorter than me at 6 ' 4 " and i 'm content with that			1
it 's hard to have a ' wish list ' , you end up placing your world in a box and you do n't see the good outside that box			2
' one of the worst dating disasters the model experienced was with a man who after their first meet , grabbed her crotch and asked ' you do n't have a penis do you ? ' as a child @entity1 was always tall and by the age of 14 and 5ft 9 , she towered over her classmates and teachers			1
' while all the girls were getting breasts , i just kept growing skywards , " said @entity1 , whose mum @entity158 was 6ft 1in and dad @entity160			1
' people called me ' giant ' and ' stretch ' because i was ridiculously tall , flat chested and lanky			0
' i hated my body so much i hid myself away and avoided the boys i fancied because i did n't want to be rejected			0
' no - boy was interested in taking me to the school prom			0
' over the next five years @entity53 suffered terrible growing pains as she shot up 11 inches , and by 19 stood at 6ft 8in			0
' it was one of the worst times of my life , ' said @entity1 , who struggled to find clothes to fit her 40 - in inside leg and shoes for size 11 feet			1
' whenever i walked into a room everyone gawked at me			0
' eve eventually took up acting classes to boost her confidence			0
' i dreamed of being a @entity186 star , but the main parts i won were as aliens or monsters , ' explained @entity1 , who has starred as @entity190 in hit @entity193 series @entity191			2
it was n't until 2004 that she finally found the courage to start dating men , after meeting @entity197 , a 5ft 10 airline mechanic in a bar			1
although the relationship fizzled out after four months , he introduced @entity53 to fitness training , which hugely boosted her confidence and made her appreciate her body			0
@entity40 says : ' the first time i met @entity13 we were going over some tax preparation , not the most romantic encounter , but then when i heard him speak @entity45 i just fell head over heels			1
he 's not like any other man i 've dated			0
' eve then joined a dating website but had little success after a handful of dates			0
then when she was 27 and working as a fitness trainer , @entity1 dated a 5ft 6 @entity218 bodybuilder for six months but eventually the relationship became very one - dimensional and she moved on			1
' @entity220 was lovely and his height did n't make a difference when lying down , but i realized i wanted a man who could sweep me off my feet intellectually as well as physically			0
' @entity226 men find me too much too handle because they 're used to a woman looking up to them and short men see me as a trophy			2
' @entity13 is n't like that , he is successful in his own right , confident and loves me for who i am			2
' eve credits her height to genes - saying her @entity238 and @entity239 heritage is the reason why she is so tall			0
she said : ' all the women in my family are tall			0
' now she has said goodbye to single life and looks forward to a future with @entity13 , and the couple have spent the summer holidaying in @entity48 and @entity246 .			2
