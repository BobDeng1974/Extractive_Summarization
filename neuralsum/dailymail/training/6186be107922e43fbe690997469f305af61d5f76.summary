officers failed to spot that a *vulnerable* girl was being abused even after she *vanished* from a children 's home more than 100 times ;
health workers sent underage victims away with *contraceptives* when they came to them with sexually transmitted *diseases* ;
social workers and teachers did not bother to investigate what had happened to victims after they had been *excluded* from school .
