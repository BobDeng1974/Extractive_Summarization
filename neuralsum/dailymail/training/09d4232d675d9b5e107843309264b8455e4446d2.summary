two days ago , @entity10 posted a photograph of himself and @entity1 on @entity89 , saying : ' @entity1 found 2 people today in prague wishing him well , people who he had never meet before , but they knew all about him ! ' while posted online today , it is not clear when exactly the footage was filmed , although at the beginning of the film @entity10 says it is sunday five - year - old cancer patient @entity1 was seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother @entity10 once it was discovered the @entity103 had fled with @entity1 in august , an international arrest warrant was issued and the parents faced a protracted legal battle to get him to the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) , with a high court judge only approving the move after they had been released from police custody in @entity110			1
the @entity106 has said proton therapy is more effective than radiotherapy as it limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs , such as the heart and liver in @entity1 's case			2
this would lead to less severe long - term side - effects including heart and breathing problems			0
the @entity41 has since agreed to fund @entity1 's treatment			2
@entity124 , of the @entity106 of @entity9 , said the boy had been moved into his own private room following his last round of proton beam therapy			0
@entity129 ( right ) claims @entity130 have accused his family of being greedy by asking for the Â£ 50k raised for his younger brother @entity1 's ( left ) treatment			1
the charity refused the request because it will be funded by the @entity41 @entity33 and @entity137 with their son @entity1 , 5 , at the @entity140 as he waits to have proton beam therapy at a clinic in @entity9 ' @entity1 left the intensive care unit on tuesday and has been put in an individual room , ' she said			2
he has ' started to put on weight , he is smiling , and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him , ' she added			0
his father , @entity150 , said the family are now considering the next step of his treatment which could see them head to @entity110			0
he said : ' now @entity1 has started his proton beam therapy , we need to be thinking about what comes next			2
' he still can not move on his own and he ca n't talk properly either so we need to think about physiotherapy and occupational therapy for him			0
' we have got a doctor who works in @entity161 coming to see us soon so he can assess @entity162 and his condition			2
but he will definitely need ongoing treatment in a hospital so we wo n't be coming home for a while			0
' he added that @entity1 still needs to be fed through a tube and they are still working out the best way to get him to the hospital in @entity110			2
' once we meet the doctor , we will have a better idea of what lies ahead , ' he said .			0
