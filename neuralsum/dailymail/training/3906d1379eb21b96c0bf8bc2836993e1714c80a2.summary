mr @entity11 often appears in the background of tv broadcasts , holding up placards campaigning against nuclear power			1
as he tried to use the interest in the @entity38 book to further his cause this morning , he came up against mr @entity3 , who runs @entity40 , the firm publishing @entity28			1
the barking of the protester 's dog - which eagerly joined in the commotion - could be heard by tv viewers as the struggle continued			1
but the terrier - carrying placards reading ' @entity50 ' on its back - failed to live up to the loyalty expected from dogs , jumping up and biting its owner on the rear			1

chief superintendent @entity63 said : ' we respect the rights of people to protest peacefully			2
we will investigate fairly any allegation regardless of who is involved and we will seek the most appropriate resolution			0
' tussle : the bizarre scene was being played out while @entity7 was defending his explosive memoirs on live tv immediately after the incident mr @entity3 remained defiant , writing on @entity75 : ' oh dear , i seem to have gone nuclear ... mirror photographer tells me i did what the snappers have wanted to do for years !

' i want to apologise and say sorry to @entity11 , who is a passionate campaigner and well known to everyone who attends party conferences and was perfectly entitled to do as he did on tuesday in trying to get attention for his causes			2
it was totally out of character for me to react to him in the way i did			0

he told @entity30 : ' two separate things - why i decided to write the book is i wanted to tell my story about my time in politics and all the lessons that i learnt from it and , indeed , the lessons that both the @entity84 and other parties can learn from the way that i got brought into the political system and the way that effectively started to operate in a way that was unacceptable			0
' in terms of why i â€™m publishing it now , i was always going to write this book at some stage , i had more lucrative offers to publish it close to the general election when it would have caused more of a distraction and chose not to do that			0
i though the earlier i published it the better			0
