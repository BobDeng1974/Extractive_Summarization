by @entity0 while @entity4 ’s wealthiest citizens continue to outpace their global peers , the country ’s middle class has lost its long held distinction of being the most affluent in the world according to new research			1
although economic growth in the @entity4 continues to be as strong as in many other countries - or stronger - only a small percentage of @entity4 households are fully benefiting from it , according to the @entity15 analysis			1
based on surveys conducted over the past 35 years , income across the lower - and middle - income tiers of @entity4 society has plateaued over that time , while citizens in other advanced countries have received considerably larger rises			1
catching up : the gap in middle class wealth between @entity25 and those in the @entity4 is rapidly narrowing @entity28 ’s middle class was substantially lagging behind the @entity4 back in 2000 , but it caught up in 2010 and has since surpassed the @entity4 in @entity30 , the average incomes still trail those the @entity4 , but the gap in several countires such as @entity33 , the @entity34 and @entity35 is much smaller than it was a decade ago			1
the income data were compiled by researcher from the @entity15 who analyzed date from the @entity41 database in connection with the @entity43			0
if the middle class are having a bad time , then the poor in the @entity4 have it even worse			0
@entity28 ¿ s middle class was substantially lagging behind the @entity4 back in 2000 , but it caught up in 2010 and has since surpassed the @entity4 a family at the 20th percentile of the income distribution in this country now makes significantly less money than a similar family in @entity28 , @entity35 , @entity54 , @entity55 or the @entity34			1
the reverse was true 35 years ago			0
in 2010 , median per capita income was $ 18,700 in the @entity4 , up 20 percent since 1980 but virtually unchanged since 2000 , after adjusting for inflation			2
by comparison , median per capita income increased 20 percent in @entity33 between 2000 and 2010 and 14 percent in the @entity34			0
median income also rose 20 percent in @entity28 between 2000 and 2010 , to $ 18,700			2
although economic growth in the @entity4 continues to be as strong as in many other countries - or stronger - only a small percentage of @entity4 households are fully benefiting from it yet according to one of the most commonly cited economic statistics - per capita gross domestic product - the @entity4 continues to maintain its lead as the world ’s richest large country			1
most @entity4 are n't keeping pace with their counterparts around the world because a large share of recent income gains is flowing to a small slice of high - earning households			2
‘ the idea that the median @entity4 has so much more income than the middle class in all other parts of the world is not true these days , ’ @entity81 economist @entity80 told the @entity43			1
‘ in 1960 , we were massively richer than anyone else			0
in 1980 , we were richer			0
in the 1990s , we were still richer			0
’ that is no longer the case , he added .			0

the country **'s** middle class has lost its distinction of being the most affluent in the world
@entity15 research over the past 35 years shows that lower - and middle - income groups in the @entity4 have plateaued over that time
@entity28 **'s** middle class has overtaken the @entity4 in recent years and a number of @entity30 countries have caught up too
the median @entity4 income - $ 18,700 - has barely changed since 2000
yet according to per capita gross domestic product the @entity4 has maintained its lead as the world ’s richest large country
only a small percentage of @entity4 are benefiting from this continued growth
