you might not think of frogs as pioneers of environmental activism			2
but @entity7 biologist and artist @entity6 has used deformities found in wild amphibians to highlight the damage we are inflicting on the planet			1
by chemically cleaning and staining terminally deformed frogs , @entity6 hopes to show how chemical run - off is harming natural wildlife			1
these images of deformed frogs by @entity7 artist @entity19 show how some animals are unable to grow the correct amount of limbs due to chemicals as a biologist , @entity19 's research focuses on deformities in amphibians			1
the frogs were collected across the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			0
enzymes were then used to make the tissues transparent.injecting coloured dyes into the bones , tissues and deformities made them stand out			0
the specimens were then posed and imaged with a high - resolution @entity41 , the images were printed with water - based ink			0
this includes those found with more or less limbs than they should have			0
these mutations can be caused by chemical run - off from factories , which can wreak havoc on complex ecosystems			0
the chemicals make the frogs more susceptible to the invasion of violent parasites into their balanced ecosystems			0
@entity19 took his scientific research and combined it with his artistic talents to create the curious displays of art. ' these abnormalities are most likely caused by predatory injury or parasitic infection while the frogs were still tadpoles , ' @entity6 told the @entity66			1
' @entity67 and parasites are natural , but environmental degradation appears to be increasing this phenomena			0
' the artistic works , known as @entity72 : @entity73 , are currently being shown at an exhibition in the @entity0 in @entity75 , the @entity1 until june			1
some of the frogs , including this @entity79 tree frog from @entity80 , @entity76 can be seen to have additional limbs rather than missing limbs due to the mutations parasites can feed on young tadpoles and alter the growth of their limbs , creating deformed frogs the entire project has taken @entity90 over 10 years to compile with the help of collaborators including @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			2
to find the deformed amphibians he headed to various wetlands and marshlands across the world including the @entity102 and @entity76			2
each inch of every frog was then chemically cleaned and stained with a different colour to produce a beautiful medium for art. this colouring also helped scientists understand the nature of the deformations			1
from his research he found the culprit for some of the missing or excess limbs were a pair of parasites called dragonfly nymphs			0
a deformed @entity121 toad ( left ) from @entity122 , @entity102 and a @entity7 green frog collected in @entity124 , @entity76 are both seen to be missing limbs , possibly due to chemical waste the frogs are thought to become more susceptible to parasites owing to chemical interference some of the frogs are seen to have an usually large number of limbs due to the mutations these parasites feed on young tadpoles and alter the growth of their limbs			1
@entity6 and his partners , however , are convinced that chemical pollution has been a major contributor to the excessive deformities seen in the amphibians			1
colouring the bones with enzymes revealed the unusual structure of the frogs they believe unsavoury environment elements have increased infections and compromised immune systems , slowly debilitating the natural growth process and making the frogs more susceptible to harmful parasites			2
ultimately , @entity19 considers amphibians to be biology 's answer to the coal mine canary , a corner of life that needs to be carefully observed to monitor our well - being			0
by depicting his findings as accessible art , @entity6 hopes he will be able to open the eyes of the world to the environmental issues that concern us all .			2

artist @entity6 has created art highlighting deformities in frogs
the terminally deformed amphibians were chemically cleaned and stained to create the *incredible* effects
but the deformities themselves are due to chemical waste that we have *dumped* into the environment
the exhibit known as @entity72 : @entity73 is on display at the @entity0 in @entity75 , the @entity1 until @entity183 the @entity0 in the @entity184 in the @entity1 .
