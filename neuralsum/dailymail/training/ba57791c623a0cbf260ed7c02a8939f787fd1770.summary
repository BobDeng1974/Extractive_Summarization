@entity0 has fond memories of sparring @entity2 - now he 's determined to give the @entity3 a night to forget			1
victory for the @entity6 featherweight at the @entity7 on saturday will set him up for a shot at @entity10 world champion @entity9			1
but standing in his way is the dangerous and undefeated 28 year old from @entity14			0
@entity0 ( right ) takes on the dangerous @entity2 in a final eliminator for the @entity10 world title on saturday ' this is the one to see if i really am a good fighter or i 'm over-hyped like some people have been saying , ' said @entity0			1
' i believe that on my day i can beat anyone			0
if i can take my best into the ring , i do n't think there 's a featherweight out there that can live with me			0
' i am not saying that based on my last performances , but in sparring and in the gym i believe that if i can replicate that i will prove it , and i need to deliver that			0
' i believe i can become the best featherweight on the planet â€“ and if you do n't believe me , i 'll open the gym up and let people come down to the gym and watch me spar			0
' @entity2 is a tough customer , he has power in both hands and is the real deal so this is the time for me to prove i can get to the top and stay there			2
' i have made my hard fights look easy recently , if i had stood and had a fight with them i might have made them look good but i boxed on the back foot , used my skills , and got easy wins			2
that 's maybe why i am not getting the credit that i should be getting			0
' @entity0 outpointed @entity51 in @entity52 in may to set him up for his biggest fight to date @entity0 and @entity2 met in sparring in @entity55 two years ago and the 27 year old hinted that fans can expect fireworks this weekend			1
' we sparred a couple of years ago when he was 23 - 0 , it was the first time i went to @entity60 , so he 's only had four fights since , ' added @entity0			1
' we sparred at @entity63 's gym a couple of times and it was competitive and then we sparred again in @entity69 's @entity68 gym a couple of times			2
' we did n't talk about fighting really , i was @entity72 champion at the time and he 's @entity3 so i had thought about it but not too much and neither had he , and we certainly did n't think we 'd be meeting in a final eliminator for a world title			1
' if the sparring is anything to go by , the fans are in for a treat			0
