by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 14:50 est , 26 june 2013 two teenage girls who incited riots in @entity3 by posting insults about about their classmates online and calling them ' sluts ' have been found guilty of defamation			1
the defendants , aged 15 and 16 , set up an @entity9 on which they posted photographs of other girls and boys annotated with derogatory remarks			1
they were ordered to pay more than £ 55,000 in compensation to their victims , while the younger girl was sentenced to juvenile detention and the elder to community service			1
one of them put out an appeal asking ' which young people are the worst sluts in @entity25 ' , and received hundreds of replies			2
the page quickly became notorious in @entity3 's second - largest city , and a crowd of hundreds turned up at one of the girl 's schools in protest at the ' slut - shaming ' behaviour , prompting a showdown with police			2
the 15 - year - old admitted setting up the @entity26 account , and although the elder girl denied the charges the @entity57 criticised her for seeming to have a poor grasp of facts			2
inflammatory : @entity25 was hit with riots over the controversial online posts in december showdown : police confronted protesters who turned up at the girls ' school in vigilante retaliation they were proven to have been responsible for the online abuse thanks to forensic evidence which was submitted to the court			1
the two girls will have to pay their 38 victims 15,000 kronor ( £ 1,450 each ) in compensation for the defamation			1
@entity77 , the lawyer for the plaintiffs , said the verdict could help curb cyber-bullying by showing that it is impossible to hide behind an online pseudonym in order to abuse others			0
mobbed : students engulfed cars at the school as they showed their anger at the account ' many think they are anonymous when they are sitting behind a computer and therefore take greater liberties than if that anonymity was n't there , ' he said			0
' the verdict sends a signal to young people and society that this indignity culture can not be allowed to exist			0
i hope it will also result in parents being more alert to what kids do at the computer			0
' however , the 16 - year - old 's lawyer @entity108 told @entity110 that the sentences were ' a little harsh ' , and criticised the ruling that the girls ' parents must pay half of their fine			0
' how can you stop your daughter from going in on the net and writing that someone is a whore when you do n't even have a computer yourself ? ' , he asked .			0
