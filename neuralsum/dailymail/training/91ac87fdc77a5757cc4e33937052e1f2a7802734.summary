@entity0 refused to blame the officials for @entity3 's defeat to @entity4 , but told his sloppy players its time to sharpen up			1
@entity7 's side halted the @entity9 ' run of eight successive league wins as they moved to within four points of the @entity13 leaders with a 2 - 1 win			1
@entity15 had a goal wrongly chalked off for offside late on as @entity4 held on for their first victory over the @entity20 giants since may 2012			1
@entity3 manager @entity0 ( right ) watches on during his side 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity4 at @entity23 @entity0 refused to point the finger at referee @entity25 or his assistants , but the @entity27 did reveal his anger at the way his team allowed @entity31 and @entity33 space to put the home side in front			1
@entity36 gave @entity3 hope with a late strike but @entity40 's recent lean spell in front of goal continued			1
the on - loan @entity44 frontman is the top @entity46 scorer with 11 strikes but has now gone four games without netting			2
@entity0 said : ' today it was two things that were most disappointing			1
we conceded two easy goals			2
we ca n't give them such easy goals as we did			2
@entity4 's @entity31 ( right ) celebrates after he put the home side ahead in the fifth minute ' secondly , it 's the fourth match now that we have created eight to 14 chances but when you score one goal that is way too little			1
we have to be more effective at putting the ball into the net			2
' the disallowed goal is disappointing			2
but over a whole season it is even - @entity25			0
' @entity31 punished @entity68 's fresh - air swipe at a loose ball inside the @entity3 box when he fired @entity4 ahead after four minutes			1
the @entity71 then set up @entity33 's header 20 minutes into the second period when he wriggled past @entity73 before standing up a fantastic cross to the back post			1
@entity15 was onside when he prodded home from @entity73 's chested pass but was hard done by as the linesman 's flag went up			2
but the @entity80 did well to play in @entity36 for @entity3 's late score			1
@entity33 ( second left ) celebrates after he doubles @entity4 's advantage in the 65th minute ' i 'm annoyed about the way we defended			1
it is easy to keep the ball , push them out - do n't let them go in and open up the goal			0
we did that twice and then you see what happens , " said @entity0			1
' could @entity40 's place be under threat ? yeah			2
we have big competition in the team , we need all the strikers we have			2
we play with the players we think are the best to win games			0
' there is one thing you have to remember with @entity40 , he has n't played football for two years before he came here			0
he started very well and now he has had a little dip			0
that is because he has to be physically stronger and play matches over time			0
' all strikers go through periods like this			0
but we have to focus on what is going to get him out of this situation			0
' @entity0 insisted @entity4 are now right in the hunt for the title but @entity7 said : ' it 's still too early to say that			1
we have to be more consistent			0
@entity3 's @entity120 ( left ) puts in a strong challenge on @entity4 's @entity122 ' we were flat last week against @entity123 , so we need this same level of energy and desire every week			1
today we also had bits of luck			0
' i did think @entity3 might be further head by now with the resources they have			1
competing with that is very difficult			0
' if something is not working , they can spend a few million and then sit him on the bench			0
' keeping hold of players will be @entity7 's main concern next month			1
the likes of @entity33 and @entity31 are certain to attract interest during the january transfer window			1
but @entity7 said : ' speculation has been part of it since i came here			1
and it will be until the end of january when the window closes			0
' i 'm hopeful i 'll still have the same squad , maybe one or two coming in , instead of going out			0
' it 's a compliment to the players			2
but for the manager it does n't help			0
last year it was n't one or two , it was six or seven			0
and we lost a couple mentally for a few weeks because of that			0
we sent @entity161 and @entity162 on holiday because they took a little dip			0
' it 's hopefully not as many this year - and there were no signs of losing focus today			2
no doubt as we get closer to the window , everybody will be linked with somebody			0
