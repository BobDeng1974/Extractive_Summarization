a team of @entity2 designers have developed a rocking chair that can transform energy from its rocking motion to charge an @entity6 or @entity7			2
built according to the classic , proven rocking chair design , the seat - which its makers have dubbed the @entity8 - uses a built - in generator that transforms gentle swaying into electricity			1
handcrafted from @entity18 pine , it is styled with all the traditional features you would expect from a rocking chair but also comes equipped with an @entity6 stand			2
@entity8 : this rocking chair which charges your @entity6 as you use it is the brainchild of a @entity2 design team perfect for the older @entity27 : the owner 's @entity6 rests conveniently on a stand built in to the chair 's armrest an updated classic : the @entity8 comes complete with stereo speakers built into the backrest the backrest of the painted wood rocking chair also features built - in speakers , presumably to pelt out @entity37 or @entity38 videos from @entity40			1
its makers claim that just an hour of easy swaying will charge your @entity6 to 35 per cent , and it is also compatible with other @entity46 devices - although publicity pictures suggest it uses the old - style connector			1
the chair uses a winding mechanism combined with a set of gears to create enough force to drive the generator , which the development team says was a challenge to make energy efficient enough for practical use			0
now , however , they believe the same mechanism could be used to fit power generation mechanisms to doors , draws and stairs			0
handcrafted : the @entity8 comes with all the design features one would expect from a rocking chair energy efficient : the chair uses a winding mechanism combined with a set of gears to create enough force to drive the generator , which its makers say generates enough power in an hour to charge an @entity6 up 35 per cent obsolete already ? publicity pictures suggest the @entity8 ships with the old - style @entity46 connector - which means an adaptor would be needed for the latest generation of @entity78 the chair is still in development , but @entity81 , the @entity82 - based design studio behind the chair , give it an estimated retail price of € 1,300 ( £ 1,038 ) - pretty steep for most pensioners			1
its makers say : ' the amount of technical gadgets we have learned to depend on has increased dramatically the last couple of years			0
' the @entity8 is an product that explores how furniture can interact with technology and actually support the power for this technology			0
' movement is energy and to collect as much of this energy as possible is one of our future challenges			0

the @entity8 can charge your @entity6 up to 35 per cent with an hour 's gentle swaying
