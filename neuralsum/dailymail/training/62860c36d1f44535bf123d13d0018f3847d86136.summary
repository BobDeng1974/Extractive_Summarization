@entity0 are attempting to return to the summit of the @entity2 with the most expensive squad ever assembled in the @entity5 game			1
the arrival of @entity7 this week takes the combined transfer fees of the @entity0 squad to an eye - watering £ 401.2million - and that figure could grow with new signings before the transfer window closes			1
the value of @entity0 's squad now outstrips their neighbours and defending champions @entity17 , who are worth a collective £ 344.15m when the transfer fees are added up			1
@entity17 's title - winning squad from last season cost £ 364.7m to put together , while their successful team from the 2011 - 2012 season was worth £ 334.5m			2
@entity0 have so far spent £ 131.7m on four players - @entity7 , @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity45 - as @entity46 desperately tries to strengthen a squad that slumped to seventh in the table last season			1
but these big money signings are merely an escalation of @entity0 's exponential buying over the last decade with 17 members of the squad costing in excess of £ 10m when they arrived at the club			2
reinforcement : @entity0 announced the £ 16m signing of @entity45 from @entity58 last week incoming : @entity20 was signed from @entity59 earlier in the summer @entity61 , for instance , cost £ 10m when signed from @entity62 in 2010 , @entity63 cost £ 16.5m when he arrived from @entity64 in 2011 , and @entity65 cost £ 15m			1
the much - maligned @entity66 was £ 27m , @entity67 £ 16m and @entity68 £ 17m			0
the result is by far the most expensively - assembled squad in the @entity2			0
and the numbers could increase further if @entity0 land £ 30m - rated @entity72 from @entity74 and other last - minute buys			2
@entity0 have made @entity72 their prime target following the arrival of @entity7 and are involved in negotiations with the @entity79 champions			2
they are also interested in the @entity81 defender @entity80 , who is well known to @entity82 , the former @entity83 coach			0
next up : @entity0 's spending could increase further if they secure a deal for @entity74 player @entity72 ( right ) @entity87 delight : @entity81 and @entity83 defender @entity80 ( left ) is also on @entity0 's radar @entity0 's total transfer fees far outstrip those of title contenders @entity33 , who squad was put together for £ 245.8m , and @entity34 , worth a combined £ 209.5m			1
as transfer fees grow ever - more extortionate , the price of assembling a title - winning squad will grow higher and higher			0
already , @entity0 have smashed the £ 400m mark			0
it surely wo n't be long before the half - a - billion point is reached			0
@entity101 joins @entity103 's @entity5 exodus			0

the current @entity0 squad cost £ 401.2m to assemble
it is the most expensive squad ever in the @entity5 game
@entity7 's move from @entity25 for £ 60m has seen @entity0 overtake rivals @entity17 , whose squad was built for a combined £ 344.15m
@entity0 have also signed @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity45
@entity32 squad put together for £ 341.8m , @entity33 £ 245.8m and @entity34 £ 209.5m
