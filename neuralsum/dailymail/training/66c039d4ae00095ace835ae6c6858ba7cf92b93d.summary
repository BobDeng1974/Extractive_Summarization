@entity0 controlled @entity2 ’s incisive pass , rolled his marker and , with the calmest of side - foot finishes sent @entity7 top of the league			1
the ecstatic roar that followed was deafening , the main stand of their 109 - year - old @entity12 home literally shaking in the excitement			2
once again , their defiant chant went up : ‘ f * * * the @entity18 and the @entity19 , we are the famous @entity7 / they tried to kill us off , but we ’re not so soft , we are the famous @entity7 ! ’ @entity7 's @entity0 scores his sides winning goal against @entity23 at @entity12 several agonising moments later , when referee @entity25 blew the final whistle , it was replaced by another song , @entity29 , blasting over the @entity30			1
it was an apt choice			0
this was @entity7 ’s seventh league win in succession , enough to take them above @entity35 and @entity36 to the @entity38 summit			1
@entity7 played in the championship as recently as 2007			1
then everything started to go wrong			0
broke and beaten down by the authorities , they suffered three successive relegations and spent five seasons in the wilderness of @entity46			1
@entity47 helped @entity7 beat @entity23 as @entity49 's side went to the top of @entity38 the team that graced the @entity52 through the @entity53 , and stunned @entity54 to win the @entity55 at @entity56 in 1988 , were in danger of being forgotten , even erased			1
but here , on a sunny @entity61 afternoon , before a sell - out crowd of more than 10,000 , their restoration to the famous @entity7 of old was well on course			1
little wonder the fans were singing that song			0
beaming chairman @entity65 said : ‘ we ’ve been through eight difficult years			2
three relegations , a total of 40 points deducted ( for being in administration )			0
@entity71 has a shot at goal under pressure from @entity75 of @entity23 ‘ down in the conference for five years , two very frustrating play - off finals ( they lost to @entity79 in 2011 and @entity80 in 2012 )			1
but finally we ’re back in @entity38 and top of the league			0
’ it was a moment of personal redemption for @entity85 ( below ) too			0
after a frustrating season in which his time on the pitch has been restricted by a niggling foot injury , he came off the bench to haunt his former club and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the travelling fans			2
he was eager to stress it was nothing personal , saying : ‘ i do sincerely apologise but i play for @entity7 now			2
i have been in a lot of pain with my foot			0
it ’s been there such a long time and in the back of your mind you do think : “ is the pain ever going to go away ? ” @entity2 and @entity0 both played key roles in @entity7 's win over @entity23 ‘ it ’s just been such a big disappointment and the celebration was all that coming out			1
’ @entity85 ’s intervention settled a thoroughly mediocre game			2
chances for either team had been a rare commodity and it looked as though @entity7 would be frustrated by @entity23 ’s second - half spoiling tactics			1
but their manager @entity49 had other ideas , as his assistant @entity119 revealed			0
look no further than @entity121 ’s eight - goal spree at @entity122			0
at the end of a week in which @entity130 was sacked , the misery around @entity124 ’s was compounded by @entity126 ’s rampant side , who recorded their biggest ever league win			2
you have to fear for the @entity133 , who have won just one of their last 25 home league games and are anchored in the @entity138 relegation zone			0
‘ it was what dreams are made of here for the @entity7 fans , ’ he said			1
‘ the momentum was there and as @entity49 said , “ it ’s made for @entity147 to grab the winner ” - and so it happened			2
’ still arrived at @entity12 in february 2013 , after the club had got through four managers in four seasons			0
slowly but surely , he has turned them around			0
‘ he is just an amazing guy , ’ said @entity65			0
‘ he ’s got everyone onside in a club where there had been quite a lot of disaffection and things have gone so badly wrong for so long and people were disenchanted with everything			0
’ as @entity7 ’s long - suffering faithful toast their ascent to the top of @entity38 , that disenchantment has been long forgotten			1
what caught my eye ... @entity171 's @entity170 dives in vein but cant prevent @entity174 's @entity173 from scoring the winner			1

@entity7 beat @entity23 1 - 0 to go above @entity35 and @entity36 in the table
the @entity179 were playing in the championship as recently as 2007
@entity7 suffered three successive relegations and then spent five years in @entity46 before *promotion* last season saw them return to the @entity19
@entity186 *tasted* success for the first time since august - and at high - *flying* @entity189 of all places . a *double* from @entity191 brought the @entity192 ’ 12 - match *unbeaten* streak crashing to a halt .
@entity174 were staring at a ninth league game without a win until a stirring second - half *fightback* from two - down defeated @entity171 . @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity173 were on target .
clubs in @entity205 and two , plus the *32* *non-league* sides who have made it through the qualifying rounds , find out their @entity212 first round *opponents* live on @entity213 at *7pm* on *monday* .
