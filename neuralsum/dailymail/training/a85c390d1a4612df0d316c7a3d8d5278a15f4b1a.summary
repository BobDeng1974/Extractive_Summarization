the space rock , 2012 @entity5 , flew past earth closer than the moon , at a distance of just 143,000 miles			1
the asteroid has a diameter of around 150 feet - and would have exploded with the force of an atomic weapon had it hit our planet			2
the flight path of asteroid 2012 @entity5 , showing its near - miss with @entity2 on sunday nothing is known about its likely composition			1
the asteroid flew past @entity2 on sunday at 9.32am gmt. an impact with an asteroid of that size would not cause a planet - wide disaster similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago - but would hit @entity2 's surface and explode			1
the asteroid was spotted by the @entity30 1 telescope in @entity31 on march 13 this year			1
' @entity5 will safely pass @entity2 on april 1 , ' said scientists at @entity34 's @entity33 via a @entity36 post			2
no danger : @entity39 astronomer @entity38 has said we have nothing to fear from 2012 @entity42 ... for now @entity34 's latest scan for ' impact event ' threats used the @entity46 , or @entity46 and took two infrared scans of the entire celestial sky between january 2010 and february 2011.the scan aimed to find asteroids and comets ' near @entity2 ' - ie within 120 million miles.the scan found there are 20,500 asteroids and comets that could destroy a city - sized area within 120 million miles of earth - previously the figure was thought to be @entity60 says the risk of impact is less than previously thought			1
the likelihood of a ' planet - killer ' - the mountain - sized asteroids in the ' large - sized ' range , above 3,300ft - appears to have fallen more @entity68 are only 981 of these objects near @entity2 , and @entity34 has found 911 of them			2
the 1.8 meter ( 60 - inch ) diameter telescope on @entity71 is designed to automatically search the skies for objects that either move or change their brightness from night to night			0
it contains the world â€™s largest digital camera , with 1,400 megapixels			0
] @entity34 has been keen to dispel any panic surrounding asteroids this year as rumours of an apocalypse linked to the @entity84 calendar have surfaced on the internet			0
' the @entity2 has always been subject to impacts by comets and asteroids , although big hits are very rare , ' @entity34 scientists wrote earlier this year			0
' the last big impact was 65 million years ago , and that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs			0
' today @entity34 astronomers are carrying out a survey called the @entity97 to find any large near - @entity2 asteroids long before they hit			2
' we have already determined that there are no threatening asteroids as large as the one that killed the dinosaurs			0
two other smaller asteroids passed safely by @entity2 over the weekend .			0

150 - foot asteroid flew past @entity2 just 143,000 miles up
only detected two weeks ago by telescope in @entity31
@entity111 would have caused *devastation* equal to nuclear bomb
