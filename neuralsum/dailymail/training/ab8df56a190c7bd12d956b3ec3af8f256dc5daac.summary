the @entity1 military has spent six months investigating ' @entity3 spy drones ' violating its air space - only to discover they were in fact @entity6 and @entity7			1
the planets were apparently mistaken for unidentified flying ' drones ' after repeated sightings in the skies above eastern @entity12 near the disputed @entity14 border area between @entity1 and @entity3			1
the military documented 155 air violations of the border - known as the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) which @entity1 shares with @entity3 - by ' unidentified flying objects ' between april 2012 and february 2013			1
with tensions increasing between the two countries , @entity1 feared that @entity3 was making nocturnal sorties across the border			1
sightings : the @entity1 military spotted 155 air violations above @entity12 , pictured , near the @entity1 - @entity3 disputed border , by unidentified ' flying objects two astronomers from the @entity28 , @entity29 , were tasked with discovering what exactly the army had been witnessing			1
astronomer @entity32 told the @entity34 - based telegraph : ' our task was to determine whether these unidentified objects were celestial or terrestrial			0
' the astronomers identified the two planets from their movements across the sky in relation to the stars			0
the @entity33 suggested the soldiers who spotted the ' drones ' ought to be let off lightly for the mix - up as planets can appear much brighter as a result of the different atmosphere at altitude and the increased use of surveillance drones by both sides			0
but the suspicions will have done nothing to help ease @entity1 - @entity3 bilateral relationships which is already on tenterhooks with @entity1 frequently accusing its neighbour of making incursions onto its territory			1
the situation reached a heated three - week - long stand - off in april after @entity3 troops were accused of setting up a camp on the @entity1 side of the @entity16 boundary			2
growing tensions : @entity3 troops ventured across the @entity16 and 19km inside @entity1 territory in the @entity70 valley near @entity71 in april @entity1 officials have reported several minor incursions since then , including three in the past week , when @entity3 troops entered the @entity1 side in the @entity77 region of northern @entity1 adjacent to southwestern @entity3			1
@entity1 and @entity3 have separately held 16 rounds of talks since 2003 to resolve their border dispute , without making much progress			2
@entity3 claims around 90,000 square kilometers ( 35,000 square miles ) of land in @entity1 's northeastern state of @entity84 , while @entity1 says @entity3 is occupying 38,000 square kilometers ( 15,000 square miles ) of territory on the @entity87 plateau in the western @entity14			1
the two nations face tensions in other areas as well			0
@entity3 is a longtime ally and weapons supplier to @entity93 , @entity1 's bitter rival			2
the presence in @entity1 of the @entity97 spiritual leader the @entity98 and the self - declared @entity99 irks @entity100			0
@entity3 is also suspicious of @entity102 's growing ties with the @entity103			0
despite the tensions , trade between @entity1 and @entity3 has soared , with @entity3 becoming @entity1 's biggest trading partner			2
two - way trade jumped from $ 5 billion in 2002 to nearly $ 75 billion in 2011 , but declined slightly last year because of global economic conditions			0
@entity1 is concerned , however , that trade remains heavily skewed in @entity3 's favor .			0
