this is the moment a cautious driver holds up a busy @entity3 street while doing a seven - point turn in his £ 294,665 @entity6 supercar			1
the motorist , spent almost one minute edging his 217mph car forward and backwards as he attempted to turn around in @entity9 in @entity3			1
the display was captured on the dashboard camera of by a taxi driver who was held up by the display			2
i have noticed new crazy driving styles too			0
' the @entity6 features a sophisticated all - wheel drive system which delivers the 700bhp produced by the 6.5litre v12 engine to all four wheels to increase grip and make it safer to drive			1
luckily for the driver concerned , the car also comes as standard with power steering as well as parking sensors			2
the @entity6 's massive engine is placed behind the driver 's cabin , over the rear wheels to produce the ultimate weight balance			0
however , even though the driver took seven attempts to turn in the road , he would not have automatically failed his driving test			1
the driver consciously avoids getting too close to the pavement in case he damages his expensive bodywork the @entity6 can hit 60mph in less than three seconds and is capable of reaching 217mph on a race track @entity52 , chief examiner of the @entity53 said it was understandable why the driver appeared to have some difficulty in turning his car			1
' the @entity6 has a particularly large footprint on the road and it is fairly clear that the driver is n't exactly certain where the front of the car ends			1
@entity63 list price : £ 294,665 engine : 6.5 litre @entity65 power : 700bhp at 8,250 rpm fuel efficiency : 16.4mpg combined 0 - 60mph : 2.9 seconds top speed : 217mph transmission : 7 - speed semi-automatic all wheel drive ' it is also very low , so i guess the driver did not want to touch the kerb as repairing the carbon fibre bodywork would be quite expensive			1
' i would expect that controlling the clutch during such a delicate manoeuvre could be tricky as well			0
' ' it is better to take an extra shunt than to hit something			0
although the driver could have considered finding an alternative place to turn in a less busy location			2
' mr @entity52 , who has more than 40 years ' driving experience said that there is a common misconception among motorists with the three - point turn			2
' it has been called the three - point turn since before i started driving			2
but the examiner will ask you to turn in the road using forward and reverse gears			0
the examiner will be looking to see if you have the car under control at all times and are keeping an adequate look out			0
the driver has to make adequate progress but you would n't automatically fail with seven turns			0
in that car it would be difficult to complete the manoeuvre in less than five			0
' i don ' think the @entity6 would be a good car for doing the driving test as the examiner would have difficulty seeing out , so it might not be an acceptable vehicle			0
' eventually after almost a minute , the @entity6 squeezes past a taxi who is busily searching for a fare			1

the 217mph super car took seven attempts to turn in a busy @entity3 street
the 700bhp monster spent almost one minute edging forwards and back
eventually on the seventh attempt the car is able to clear a waiting taxi
the @entity130 was filmed on a second taxi 's dash - cam
