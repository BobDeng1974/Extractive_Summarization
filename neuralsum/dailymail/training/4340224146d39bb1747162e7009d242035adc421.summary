his colourful past has included a spell behind bars and a stint on a reality tv show			0
but lord @entity6 broke new ground last week when a convoy of removal vans packed with his family ’s art and antique furniture was pursued by eight police cars up a busy motorway			1
far from being the result of a daring heist , however , staff working for the peer were pulled over by officers as he attempted – he claims rightfully – to reclaim a number of valuable family heirlooms at the centre of a financial dispute			1
scroll down to see video @entity26 , who attempted - he claims rightfully - to reclaim a number of valuable family heirlooms @entity26 and a team of removal men with three vans had taken the items from his family estate – @entity33 in @entity34 – early on thursday morning			1
he had driven ahead but officers caught up with the vans nearby on the @entity38 and forced their drivers to return the antiques to the stately home pending a police investigation			1
last night , @entity26 , 62 , told the @entity43 : ‘ it is a total farce			0
‘ the contents are worth millions of pounds and include furniture plus art from @entity48 – items which have been in our family for a long time			1
i ’m gobsmacked that on the @entity53 ’s highway somebody can be stopped by the police for transporting their own furniture			2
’ the row centres on the contents of @entity33 , which he was forced to lease when he was jailed for an insurance scam in the 1990s because he could not afford to maintain the £ 200million estate from prison			1
a second agreement was drawn up so that the antique contents of the hall could also be rented , and it is an alleged failure to keep up with payments on this contract that led to @entity26 ’s dawn raid on the 500 - acre estate			2
removal men carrying the valuable artwork from @entity33 in @entity34 but the antiques were eventually ordered to be returned to the stately home the peer , his estate agent and 43 removal men apparently walked in to the hall through open doors and claimed almost all of the furniture and antiques inside – including works by @entity48 , @entity83 and sir @entity84 and a pair of @entity87 walnut side tables			1
the items removed are thought to be worth more than £ 2million			2
@entity26 , who has appeared on tv reality show @entity89 ! , added : ‘ the police have hijacked a couple of million pounds worth of stuff but have n’t asked any questions about who owns it			2
what is going on ? why was that ? ’ @entity33 was built in 1760 and has housed royalty , prime ministers and one of @entity103 ’s lovers			1
@entity33 in @entity104 in @entity34 , which @entity26 was forced to lease when he was jailed and could n't afford to maintain the estate from prison lord @entity6 ’s family bought the estate about a century ago and he inherited it from his grandfather in 1971			1
but in 1996 the @entity111 and former army officer was jailed for five years for a fraudulent £ 4.3million insurance claim on four of his vintage sports cars			0
he decided to lease the property for £ 9million for 60 years			2
the property has been rented since then by @entity118 , part of @entity121 - based @entity120 , which is run by @entity123 hotelier @entity122			0
the estate has been run as a historic house and golf club , used for corporate entertainment , conferences , exhibitions and weddings			2
mr @entity122 and @entity118 did not respond to requests for comment			0
a spokesman for @entity134 said : ‘ detectives from @entity104 ’s @entity136 are currently investigating an incident that occurred at @entity33 on thursday morning			1
‘ officers attended the estate following a report of property being taken			1
following officers ’ attendance , the property was returned			0
‘ currently , officers are attempting to establish the exact circumstances of what has happened and whether any criminal offences have been committed			0
’ @entity153 solicitors , for the trustees of the @entity155 which owns and leases the property , said in a statement : ' much of the contents of @entity33 in terms of the pictures , @entity6 family portraits and family heirlooms have been licenced to a tenant , a company called @entity162 which currently operates @entity33 as a golf course and conference centre			1
' the trustees of @entity33 ended the licences with the tenant in november 2013 and requested the return of the items to the trust			1
' the tenant is legally obliged to return these items to the @entity171			1
despite written requests to the tenant ’s solicitors , the tenant has failed to return the items			2
' yesterday morning ( 19th june ) , a removal company , at the request of the trustees went into the @entity179 , as they had the right to do , without the use of any force , and removed many of the contents that belonged to them			0
the contents were removed in three separate vans			0
' we believe that the incident may have been mistakenly reported as a theft			0
it was not a theft			0
' the trustees are entitled to possession of those goods			0
the tenant ( @entity196 ) is well aware that the licences allowing it to use the goods ended last november and no argument has ever been received from the tenant to the contrary			0
the tenant knows that it is not entitled to the goods and has no right to be using them			0
