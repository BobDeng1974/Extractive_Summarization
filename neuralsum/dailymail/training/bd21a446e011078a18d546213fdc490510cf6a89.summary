' mr. b ' , a 60 year old @entity9 man who had suffered from severe obsessive - compulsive disorder ( @entity11 ) and anxiety since the age of 13			1

following a successful implant to treat the symptoms , a dutch 60 year old told doctors he had become a huge @entity4 fan after hearing the song @entity18			1
before the implant , mr @entity28 's musical taste was broad , covering @entity9 - language songs , the @entity31 and his favourite band , the @entity32			1
following the implant , he had been listening to the radio , when he heard ' @entity18 ' of the @entity35 and was deeply affected by the song			1
' mr. @entity38 started to listen to more songs of @entity4 and noticed that he was deeply moved by the raw and low - pitched voice of the singe , ' the team said			1
' moreover , he experienced that he preferred the performance of the songs in the @entity45 and @entity46 , due to the fullness of the voice of the older @entity4 in that period			1
' his favorite songs , ' @entity50 ' , ' @entity18 ' and ' sunday morning coming down ' had a certain rhythm with a fast tempo in common that moved him			2
' the authors , @entity57 and colleagues , said the unnamed man had suffered from severe obsessive - compulsive disorder ( @entity11 ) and anxiety since the age of 13			2
medications and psychotherapy had failed to help , so he was given deep brain stimulation ( @entity66 ) as a last resort treatment			0
' our patient reported that after @entity66 he was grasped in particular by the rhythm of @entity4 songs and by the tone of his voice , ' the team said			2
the electrodes were placed in the nucleus accumbens region of the brain			0
mr. @entity38 reported he felt very confident , calm and assertive and he started to call himself ' mr. @entity79 ' , the new and improved version of himself			0
' it could be suggested that the image he creates when listening to songs of @entity4 seems to match his ' new ' confident self , ' the researchers wrote			0
before the implant , mr @entity28 's musical taste was broad , covering @entity9 - language songs , the @entity31 and his favourite band , the @entity32			1
however , after it , he said those bands were ' banned ' and only listened to @entity4 ' like mr. @entity79 states : ' it seems as if @entity4 goes together with @entity66			0
' the team also found the change is taste was directly linked to the implant			0
' moreover , his former musical taste reoccurred immediately when stimulation was interrupted due to battery depletion , suggesting a direct causal link between musical preference and stimulation of the accumbens			0
' interviews also revealed that before the implant , the man had little interest in music			0
' mr. @entity38 , had never been a huge music lover , ' they wrote			0
' his musical taste was broad , covering @entity9 - language songs , the @entity31 and the @entity32 , with a preference for the last named			2
' while music did not occupy an important position in his live , his taste in music had always been very fixed and his preferences stayed the same throughout decades			0
' after undergoing the surgery , 12 months later the patient admitted his new musical taste			0
' he had been listening to the radio , when he coincidentally heard ' @entity18 ' of the @entity35 singer and experienced that he was deeply affected by the song			1
' mr. @entity38 started to listen to more songs of @entity4 and noticed that he was deeply moved by the raw and low - pitched voice of the singer			1
' moreover , he experienced that he preferred the performance of the songs in the @entity45 and @entity46 , due to the fullness of the voice of the older @entity4 in that period			2
banned : the @entity31 were also a pre-operation favourite of mr b - but he can no longer enjoy them ' his favorite songs , ' @entity50 ' , ' @entity18 ' and ' sunday morning coming down ' had a certain rhythm with a fast tempo in common that moved him			2
' mr. @entity38 reported that he felt good following treatment with @entity66 and that the songs of @entity4 made him feel even better			0
' from this moment on , mr. @entity38 kept listening simply and solely to @entity4 and bought all his cd ’s and @entity144 ’s			0
' when listening to his favorite songs he walks back and forth through the room and feels like he finds himself in a movie in which he plays the hero ’s part			0
' he reports that there is a @entity4 song for every emotion and every situation , feeling happy or feeling sad and although mr. @entity38 played almost simply and solely @entity4 songs for the following years , the music never starts to annoy him			1
' from the first time mr. @entity38 heard a @entity4 song , the @entity9 - language songs , the @entity31 and the @entity32 have been banned			1

60 year old @entity9 @entity11 sufferer had implant fitted to control symptoms
