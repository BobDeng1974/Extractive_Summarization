@entity0 has insisted he would have no problem convincing the authorities that he is ‘ fit and proper ’ to become an @entity4 director as he described the current @entity6 board as ‘ one of the worst the club has ever had ’			1
the crisis - torn club announced plans on monday to fight @entity0 ’s bid to oust chairman @entity13 , chief executive @entity14 , finance director @entity15 and director @entity16 at an egm to be held within the next six weeks			1
@entity0 needs to win 51 per cent of the vote if he is to succeed in replacing the unpopular current directors with himself , fellow @entity21 director @entity20 and @entity22 , the former managing director of @entity24 brewer @entity23			1
@entity0 ( above ) says he 'll have no problems convincing the @entity6 board he 's fit enough to run the club @entity6 chairman @entity13 ( left ) with @entity14 ( right ) but , in a clear reference to @entity0 paying £ 44million in @entity31 after pleading guilty to contravening tax laws , the board told the stock exchange on monday : ‘ the rules require that all individuals appointed to the board of an @entity38 company are suitable to be a director of a @entity41 public company			1
’ in addition to the @entity38 market , @entity0 and @entity20 will also have to convince the @entity44 they are ‘ fit and proper ’ people to be directors after previously being on the board at @entity4 prior to @entity48 leading the club into administration and then liquidation			1
yet @entity0 said : ‘ there are no problems regarding the @entity38 regulations and the issue with the @entity44 is simple			1
only once a director is appointed is an application made to the @entity44 by the club			2
‘ both myself and @entity20 will have to deal with our previous directorship at the time that @entity48 got involved			0
additionally , i will have to deal with my reasons for staying on the board and trying to impose some level of governance during the @entity68 era			0
‘ i will also deal with my favourable settlement in @entity31			2
‘ these are all issues that the @entity44 rightly has to address in the same way that the @entity44 has to review the history of anyone who gets involved with a @entity75 football team			0
@entity76 ( left ) appointed his associate @entity14 ( right ) as @entity6 chief executive in december off - field politics have prompted numerous protests from @entity6 fans this season ‘ that was all considered by me prior to my application - as was the likelihood that the incumbent board will use the media to try and influence the debate by misrepresentation			1
‘ the enthusiasm that this board adopts to ‘ media management ’ and its failure to act in the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders is exactly why they should be jettisoned in favour of directors who have the requisite business skills and respect for the tradition of @entity6 to take the club forward			2
‘ history will judge this board as one of the worst the club has ever had			0
there is not one individual who puts the club above personal interest			0
’ @entity0 ’s salvo came after @entity6 called on him to drop his call for a general meeting on monday morning and to save the financially - stricken club the expense of hosting it			1
the board ’s 7am statement added : ‘ if the notice ( issued by @entity0 ) is valid and is not withdrawn , the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions			2
’ in a second statement , the under - fire @entity6 directors conceded they may have to consider using @entity4 as security on a loan - but insisted any decision would not be ‘ taken lightly ’			1
shareholders arrive at @entity4 in @entity24 , ahead of the 2014 @entity6 agm			2
fans protested against that possibility before friday night ’s abandoned clash with @entity133 after it was revealed @entity136 owner and @entity138 tycoon @entity76 - who owns an 8.92 - per - cent stake in @entity6 - had applied for security over both the stadium and @entity142 as part of a £ 10million loan arrangement			1
the so - called @entity145 - wealthy fans @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 - had already announced they would increase their own loan offer of £ 5m but would not ask for security on the stadium			0
the board added : ‘ the directors are pursuing bilateral discussions with two parties who are both stakeholders in @entity6			0
‘ these discussions contemplate a significant amount of capital being available to the business on a long - term basis in order to enhance the squad which the directors believe is necessary			0
‘ a consequence of funding to this level is that , in reality , it may be necessary to use @entity4 stadium as security ; such a decision would not be taken lightly			2
‘ no decision has been taken at the current time while discussions are being finalised in good faith			0
‘ the advance notice does not mean that security will be given , and the directors are adamant that it will not unfairly advantage the party with whom it was agreed			0
‘ the board will conclude a transaction , based on its merits , which it believes is in the best interests of shareholders as a whole in accordance with their fiduciary duty			0
