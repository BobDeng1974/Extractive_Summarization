@entity2 's lifestyle website @entity0 is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again , this time to pregnant women			1
according to ms @entity2 's osteopath - self - described pain expert @entity5 , who penned ' ten ways to have a pain - free pregnancy ' for @entity0 - expectant mothers should be careful not to ' relax their vigilance over food ' , and to always ' remind ' themselves : ' you do n’t need a ton of food to sustain your baby			1
' ms @entity5 ' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - ' dairy , rich fatty meats , pork , peanut butter , wheat and sugar , for example ' - is very much in keeping with ms @entity2 's strict diet , so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health - focused website			1
' but while a number of the tips offered up in the piece – such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet – have been welcomed by health experts , dr. @entity47 , an internist and the author of popular advice site , @entity50 , tells @entity56 that there is little scientific fact to back up some of @entity0 ’s advice			1
' although not as " sexy " as " anti-inflammatory diets " and " magical cures " , common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy , ' she says of the website ’s top tips			1
and when it came to ms @entity72 ’s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a ‘ magical cure ’ for morning sickness – while other foods like wheat , dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation – dr @entity47 explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims			0
' i am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation , let alone any evidence to support it , ' dr @entity47 remarks			0
' most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates , crackers for example , help with the nausea			0
' glowing : in keeping with ms @entity2 's strict diet , ms @entity72 advises expectant moms avoid ' dairy , rich fatty meats , peanut butter , wheat and sugar '			1
pictured , ms @entity2 pregnant with her daughter @entity38 in 2004 ms @entity72 also makes several references to the impact of the ' pressure ' caused by the growing baby on a mother - to - be 's back , and warns against lower back massages			1
' pregnant women should n't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy , ' counters dr @entity47			0
' remember women 's pelvis ' evolved to a different shape than men 's because we become pregnant			0
' as for diet , dr @entity47 recommends a variety of ' fruits , vegetables , whole grain cereals , and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat '			2
she does concur with ms @entity41 on her advice that pregnant women should ' watch their portion size ' however , and recommends ' avoiding fast foods , overly processed foods , and sugared sodas '			0
one of us : while critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years , ms @entity2 , pictured last week in @entity137 , recently insisted she was ' incredibly close to the common woman ' in regards to recommended weight gain , dr @entity47 admits : ' there is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy			1
' it depends on whether you are normal , over , or underweight to start with			0
' ' normal weight women should gain between 25 - 35 pounds , underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds , and overweight between 15 - 25 pounds			2
obese women should gain slightly less , between 11 - 20 pounds			2
other kernels of advice offered up by ms @entity72 in her recent @entity0 post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day , and plenty of time spent in the ' bathtub , a pool , or the sea			1
' she even helpfully suggests : ' the crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you ’re pregnant ! ' repeat offender : @entity0 ( pictured ) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice , not to mention outrageously expensive products this is far from the first time @entity0 has been criticized for its questionable health advice			2
in january , ms @entity2 came under fire for suggesting women partake in ' vaginal steams ' , which she said ' cleanse your uterus ' and ' balance female hormone levels '			2
this information was slammed by doctors , some who even suggested the practice might be harmful			0
just this week , ms @entity2 defended herself in the face of long - standing criticism surrounding @entity0 's expensive and unattainable content			1
speaking to @entity188 , she said : ' i 'm incredibly close to the common woman in that i 'm a woman and i 'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers			2
' we all want fulfillment , we all want to live our best lives			0
we want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life			0
i think that 's all women			0

mother - of - two @entity2 *enlisted* her go - to ' pain expect ' , @entity5 , to write the tips on her lifestyle website , @entity0
while some of the tips , like eating healthily and keeping calm , have been welcomed by experts , others have proven less popular
