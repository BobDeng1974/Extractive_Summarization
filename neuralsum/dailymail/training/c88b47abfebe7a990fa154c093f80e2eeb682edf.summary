the majority of the money - up to £ 15.5 billion - would be used to upgrade and renew the high voltage electricity network in @entity122 and @entity123 and the high pressure gas network across the @entity96 , creating some 7,000 jobs in the supply chain			0
a further £ 7 billion would be spent on making sure the gas networks to homes and businesses remain safe and reliable and would connect 80,000 households to the gas network for the first time			2
