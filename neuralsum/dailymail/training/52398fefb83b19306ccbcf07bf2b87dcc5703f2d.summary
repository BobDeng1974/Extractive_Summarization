by @entity0 published : 08:08 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 18:19 est , 10 december 2012 a toddler born with a condition that meant her tongue would n't stop growing can now smile for the first time , thanks to surgery			1
baby @entity7 nearly suffocated because her tongue suffered ' accelerated growth ' - caused by @entity10			1
the disorder left her unable to eat or talk and strangers asked if she was sticking her tongue out at them			1
doctors spotted the unusual growth disorder , which can affect any area of the body , while she was still in the womb			2
@entity7 's mother @entity22 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , was seven months pregnant with her fourth child when she and her husband @entity23 , 38 , paid for a private 4d scan			1
but during the scan the sonographer noticed the baby ’s tongue was abnormally large			1
she referred the family back to the hospital where further @entity48 scans confirmed @entity7 was suffering with @entity10			2
mrs @entity7 , 27 , said : ' it felt like somebody had dropped a bomb			2
we were warned her tongue would be up to three times the size of a usual newborn baby and would keep growing			0
nobody could tell us how big it would get			0
' mrs @entity7 ( left , with husband @entity23 ) said : ' @entity7 is the sweetest little girl you could meet ' mrs @entity7 was booked in for a caesarean section at 38 weeks but her waters broke the day before and she was rushed into theatre for an emergency operation on march 3rd 2010			1
she said : ‘ i did n’t get to see her when she was born because she was rushed straight to baby care to check her breathing			0
but my husband brought me a picture on my phone and my heart melted straight away			0
‘ yes her tongue was very big and protruding from her mouth but she was just as gorgeous as my other children and i could n’t wait to hold her			0
’ the size of @entity7 's tongue meant she could n’t latch on to her mother 's breast , so she was tube fed and kept in hospital for the first six weeks of her life			2
@entity7 's parents said they were terrified as doctors did n't know how large her tongue would get back home her parents did n’t notice how quickly her tongue was growing , but at a check up aged 12 weeks doctors noticed it had got so big she was struggling to breathe			1
@entity7 was readmitted for emergency surgery to fit a tracheotomy - cutting a hole in the neck to access the windpipe - to help her breathe			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i was distraught			2
seeing her every day we just had n’t noticed how much it had grown			0
to be told her life was at risk because her tongue was so big was devastating			0
’ @entity7 remained on a ventilator until her breathing stabilised and was kept in hospital until she was well enough to undergo her first tongue reduction operation in september 2010 aged just six months			2
she was finally allowed home four months later in january 2011 aged ten months old			0
her father @entity23 gave up his job as a chef to become her full time carer , learning how to tube feed her			0

@entity7 had to be tube fed as she could n't latch on to her mother 's breast due to her over-sized tongue but @entity7 ’s tongue continued to grow rapidly once again putting her life at risk and a second operation was scheduled for march 2011			2
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ it was frustrating for her because she could n’t eat or talk but she did start to learn sign language to communicate with us and her brothers and sister			1
‘ the worst part was when people would stare			0
they obviously thought she was poking her tongue out at them			0
' @entity7 is the sweetest little girl you could meet and would never dream of being rude or cheeky but her tongue had grown so big she could n’t close her mouth let alone smile , talk or eat			1
‘ our biggest fear was that she could suffocate			0
’ @entity7 's abnormally large tongue was spotted by the sonographer during a private 4d scan			1
in this collect she ( bottom left ) is pictured with her brothers and sisters recovering : @entity7 after having surgery on her tongue			1
doctors think it has now stopped growing more reduction surgery in march this year was deemed a success and @entity7 ’s tongue finally stopped growing			1
it meant that doctors could recently remove her tracheotomy and delighted @entity7 now ca n’t stop smiling			1
she ’s also learning to eat and talk , too			0
‘ we ’d never heard of anything like it before and to be honest it sounded like something out of a horror film but we are so happy that the surgery has been a success because @entity7 has a gorgeous smile and now she ca n’t stop flashing it			2
‘ we thought she was beautiful before but to see her smiling now melts my heart			0
she has been through so much and has always been such a happy little girl			0
but now thanks to her lovely smile it shows on the outside too			0

@entity7 , now two , was born with syndrome that caused accelerated growth of her tongue . doctors first noticed something amiss during a 4d scan
the condition left her unable to eat or talk and she needed a tracheotomy to help her breathe
it is now under control after three rounds of surgery and her parents say she is always smiling and is catching up with her peers
