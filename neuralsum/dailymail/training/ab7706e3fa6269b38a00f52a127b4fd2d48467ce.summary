by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:29 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:32 est , 23 december 2013 mighty wings will be returning to a @entity4 's near you - though not necessarily due to popular demand			1
@entity4 's began stockpiling chicken wings earlier this year for its @entity9 promotion which debuted on september 9			1
but the spicy wings did n't fly out of stores , and now the company has 10 million pounds of @entity14 in cold storage			1
in a flap : @entity4 's franchisees must participate in another @entity18 promotion after the first failed to offload the stockpile of chicken wings @entity4 's media relations executive @entity22 said in a statement : ' we 're bringing back @entity14 - stay tuned			1
' before the wings were launched in september , the company released a statement explaining : ' with the introduction of @entity9 , @entity29 € ™ s is bringing the popularity and fun of chicken wings to customers seeking any time and any reason to enjoy them			0
' customers , however , did not take to the @entity9 , and the company still has 20 per cent of its original supply of chicken wings left			0
according to the @entity40 , @entity4 's franchisees have been told they must participate in another @entity42 promotion or pay for the excess inventory			2
fowl play : many customers felt the wings were priced too highly at $ 1 per wing @entity4 's ceo @entity47 has acknowledged that one reason the wings did n't sell well was that the price was ' not the most competitive			1
' the wings were priced at $ 2.99 for three - well above competitor @entity53 's pricing of five wings for $ 3.99			0
many customers baulked at paying a dollar per wing at the fast food chain , where they can purchase a whole burger for the same price			1
the @entity40 reports that franchisees commented on the problem in a survey in october while the promotion was running			0
winging it : the company will roll out the promotion around the country soon ' @entity9 are proving once again that we canâ € ™ t sell premium items in large numbers because we still have the @entity73 , ' one franchisee said in the anonymous survey			0
the higher prices came after @entity4 's began buying up big in the chicken wing market , driving prices up and necessitating a higher price point for the company to make its margin			2
critics have also noted that the breaded and fried wings were too spicy to appeal to the @entity4 's customer			2
when @entity9 land at @entity4 's outlets again soon , they will be priced more competitively .			0

@entity4 's still have 10 million pounds of chicken wings leftover from its @entity89 promotion
the fast food chain plans to *reinstate* the promotion to try and sell off the wings
they original offer ran from september to *november* but was not popular
the wings were criticized for being too *expensive* and too spicy
the wings are in cold storage until mighty wings go back on the menu
