@entity0 has a riddle to solve : how does he keep @entity2 one of the most potent sides in @entity5 without one of the best players in the world ? slowly but surely , we are starting to see the answer he will provide			1
moving on without @entity10 , the man who provided 31 goals last season and perpetual threat , is going to be a challenge but that is not to say @entity2 will stall without him			2
@entity17 and penetration from all areas is what @entity0 wants to see from his side in the new campaign , with the goals and threat being shared out and at times during their latest friendly – a 1 - 0 win over @entity26 , secured by @entity28 ’s goal – you saw how it might all fit together			1
subs : @entity70 , @entity71 goal : sterling 5 @entity26 : @entity34 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 @entity83 had @entity63 dropping deep , acting like a quarterback in a stadium synonymous with @entity86			0
to his sides , @entity87 and @entity49 provided energy , while up front @entity50 , @entity48 and @entity28 kept @entity2 explosive			1
there will , inevitably , be adjustments made to this line - up before their new campaign begins on august 17 , not least as a new £ 20million defender in @entity97 needs to slot in , but this might just have been a glimpse of the @entity2 of the future			1
clearly , it is impossible to say at such an early stage whether this new look squad will be superior to the group @entity10 inspired before his £ 75m sale to @entity107 , but @entity0 unquestionably has a plan , one that he believes will keep @entity2 on the front foot			1
that is how they started their campaign in the grandly titled @entity113 ; @entity26 could n’t contain them in the opening 10 minutes , as @entity28 , @entity48 and @entity50 scurried forward , constantly running beyond the @entity117 defence			1
@entity119 tackle : @entity63 launches himself at @entity78 ' shot as @entity58 looks on midfield battle : @entity48 comes under pressure from @entity123 in @entity124 high jump : @entity58 and @entity80 go for the ball determination : @entity56 battles with @entity128 for possession clearing his lines : all eyes are on @entity34 as he thwarts a @entity2 attack @entity28 opened the scoring after five minutes , dashing into the danger zone to feed on the scraps after @entity50 , who had been set free by @entity63 , scuffed a shot that cannoned off @entity73 and fell invitingly at the @entity140 forward ’s feet			1
a few more goals should have followed before half - time			0
@entity2 have only been in training for three weeks – some of this starting line - up only returned last monday – but they looked sharper and more nimble than their opponents in the stifling 28 degree heat			2
@entity147 sped inside two tackles before curling his shot over the bar ; next @entity49 almost burst through after @entity28 and @entity48 had impressively combined , while @entity63 fired a series of dangerous set plays into the area			1
@entity26 , by contrast , offered no threat and their physical approach was illustrated by the fact @entity159 and @entity123 were booked for crude challenges			0
@entity82 , meanwhile , was shown a yellow card after he dived to win a penalty			0
as is always the case with these games , a raft of changes followed in the second half			0
@entity26 almost found a way back into the match , when @entity128 cracked a drive against the crossbar in the 50th minute but that was the only scare @entity2 had			0
if anything , they had more opportunities to win			0
the best fell to @entity68 , whose right - footed drive in the 75th minute was beaten away by @entity26 keeper @entity34 , while @entity67 found the side - netting with a powerful effort from 20 yards			2
denied : @entity159 challenges @entity50 as @entity73 watches on a meeting of minds : @entity181 legend @entity180 and @entity0 share a moment before the game i beg your pardon : a @entity63 fan expresses her support for the @entity2 captain in full voice : @entity2 fans sing that famous , spine - tingling anthem before kick - off even though there were no further goals , a crowd of 36,170 saw @entity2 take a definite step forward on their performance when they lost 1 - 0 to @entity199 in @entity200 and @entity0 will be looking for more of the same again when they return to @entity201 for the first time in 10 years to play @entity203			1
@entity203 , of course , are the standard - bearers back in the @entity206 but the game may yet be revealing to see where @entity2 now stand in relation to the champions			1
two points separated them last may – @entity0 will be hoping the changes he has made will bridge that gap			2
after the game , @entity0 said : ' i 'm evaluating the fitness of the players but i was delighted with the team			0
pride and passion : @entity2 fans show their colours during the friendly at @entity222 in @entity124 @entity223 is the colour : the crowd in @entity226 was a sea of red as @entity230 - based @entity2 fans had the chance to cheer on their team you 'll never walk alone : one @entity2 fan joins in with the singing stateside support : these fans had an excellent view of @entity2 's 1 - 0 win against the @entity117 champions hand on heart : fans pledge their allegiance to @entity2 as the match gets underway ' we will get sharper but at the minute we are building up the resistance			1
our passing was crisp and precise and i was also pleased with how we defended			0
' @entity0 also paid tribute to @entity50 and was excited by the impact @entity48 made			1
' i have seen a difference in @entity252 and i think he 's ready to be the main man , ' he added			0
' he has come back from the @entity254 looking really sharp			0
@entity48 looked exciting and @entity28 was a joy to watch			2
' @entity2 's move to sign striker @entity257 broke down earlier in the day , and @entity0 added : ' we are disappointed for the player but we have to move on			2
we have made a decision			0

@entity28 fired the @entity262 ahead after five minutes with a close - range effort
@entity0 named a strong side to face the @entity117 champions
@entity48 made his first appearance in a @entity2 shirt
the @entity262 will also face @entity271 and @entity203 in @entity272 of the @entity273
