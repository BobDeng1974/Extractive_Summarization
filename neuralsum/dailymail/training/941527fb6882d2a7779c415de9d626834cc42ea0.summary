and when pushed to state what they weigh , 60 per cent of @entity13 will claim to be at least half a stone lighter than they actually are			0

' a spokesman for eating disorder charity beat told @entity124 : ' this type of exploitation of the most toxic aspect of celebrity culture is just wrong in so many ways			1
' of course many people are concerned about maintaining a healthy weight , but inviting a spurious comparison with another person ’s supposed weight does n't help anyone			0
' @entity136 ( 23 per cent happy ) @entity137 ( 19 per cent happy ) @entity138 ( 17 per cent happy ) @entity139 ( 16 per cent happy ) @entity140 ( 15 per cent happy ) @entity141 ( 20 per cent unhappy ) @entity142 ( 18 per cent unhappy ) @entity143 ( 16 per cent unhappy ) @entity144 ( 16 per cent unhappy ) @entity145 ( 15 per cent unhappy ) a-list weights : the scales will show you as a @entity62 if you weight around 8st 9lb and 14st women are an @entity65 @entity151 nutricentre.com nutritionist said : ' i am very concerned with the concept of celebrity weighing scales			1
as a nutritionist i have no objection to women weighing themselves in kg - this is commonplace on normal scales and many women choose the metric method of weight – for example in @entity163 and @entity164			2
' comparing your weight to anyone - your friends , sister or colleagues would be a very unhealthy way to judge your own weight – so a comparison to celebrities is even worse			0
' these scales do not take into account body fat percentage , height , @entity178 , waist and hip measurements and common sense on what is a healthy weight for an individual			0
' not only is this concept deeply unscientific but also i believe it would encourage even more insecurity and anxiety about weight which is a sad situation			0
' these scales also set a very poor example to teenage girls who are often more susceptible to eating disorders and are easily impressed by celebrity status			2
