more than half of them were still serving at the time			0
' corrupt ' : the report alleges that criminals had free access to information held by the @entity9 the documents , leaked to the @entity29 , concludes that organised criminals were able to infiltrate @entity30 ' at will ' and access confidential information from secure databases			1
the report , written by a team led by @entity35 , the force 's former assistant commissioner , spoke to informants , used intelligence from intercepted telephone conversations , interviewed officers and scoured old police files to reach its conclusions			0
the @entity9 today insisted that the force has ' changed vastly ' since the report was completed			1
but a recently retired senior officer , speaking anonymously to the newspaper , said that : ' the @entity9 is still every bit as corrupt as it was back then			0
' details of the report include a case in which a police statement from a sensitive witness was found in a nightclub controlled by a family of suspected gangsters			0

he said : ' i think everyone recognises that the police has changed vastly over the past five years - let alone the last 10 or 15 years			2
' a statement issued by the force also said that the @entity9 continues to investigate corruption , and has ' no complacency ' about the matter			2
it said : ' the dedicated @entity90 ( @entity91 ) , part of the @entity9 's @entity93 , proactively investigates any allegations or intelligence relating to either corrupt police officers and staff and those that may seek to corrupt our officers or staff			0
' all such allegations and intelligence are taken extremely seriously and any any lessons learnt from resulting investigations are used to further our efforts to reduce the likelihood of such offences occurring in the future			0
' there is no complacency in the @entity9 's determination to succeed in this task and the work of the officers and staff of the @entity91 is undertaken relentlessly and determinably , fully recognising that criminals who seek to corrupt our officers and staff will remain a threat			0
