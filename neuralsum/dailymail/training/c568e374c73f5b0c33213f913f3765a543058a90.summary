mr @entity40 – from @entity48 in @entity49 – said : ‘ he only got nine months for perverting the course of justice , and we had nine years of struggle to come to terms with what we lost that evening			1

‘ @entity5 was able to set up a life for himself in this country , getting married and having children			1
@entity5 has been sent to prison a decade after hitting @entity33 while talking on his phone ‘ when police told him what he had done the day @entity33 died he simply ran away with no regard for the consequences of his actions – no regard for our laws			1
as a family we want to see him deported back to @entity18			1
we do not understand why he has been treated like a @entity19 citizen when he never behaved like one in the first place			1
‘ why should he have the benefit of our taxpayers ’ money and all the services we provide prisoners ? ’ mr @entity40 , who was on a posting in @entity83 with his wife on the day of the fatal crash in november 2003 , said he would never get over it			1
‘ when we came back to the @entity19 after the accident @entity33 was laid there on life support , ’ he added			1
‘ her mum and her sister painted her nails and we said our goodbyes			0
she was so young – she was incredibly bright , she was our blonde haired sparkly eyed girl and she was robbed from us			0
’ privately - educated @entity33 was stranded in the outside lane of the @entity97 after she lost control of her @entity99 after leaving @entity100 in @entity101 , where she worked for @entity102			1

the figures show that 93 of the 555 murder charges in 2012 were laid against foreign nationals			0
for the 3,436 rape cases , 632 of the accused were foreign nationals			0
many of the cases will still be making their way through the criminal justice system			0
the only constabulary in the survey of 43 police forces in @entity128 and @entity129 not to have foreign citizens on its books for rape or murder was @entity134 in rural @entity129			2
@entity49 refused to reveal the nationalities of the eight foreigners it has charged with rape , saying it could lead to ethnic victimisation			0
in @entity141 , more than a third of the 210 rape suspects charged in 2012 were from overseas			0
twenty - four were from @entity142 , 14 from @entity143 , 13 from @entity144 and ten from @entity145			2
of the 180 the @entity146 charged with murder , 41 were foreigners , including seven from @entity142 and five from @entity149 , @entity144 and @entity150			0
following the crash police officers took down @entity5 ’s details but allowed him to leave the scene to recover from the ‘ shock and trauma ’ of the crash			1
within a year he was travelling back and forth between @entity19 and @entity18 on business			1
in 2007 , he returned to the @entity19 using his real name and was given student status while working full time for his business , @entity161			2

he first came to @entity19 in 1999 , using false papers			1
he was told he faces deportation when he leaves prison			0
judge @entity186 said : ‘ you had no right to be on the motorway unsupervised as inevitably you were			0
‘ the telling feature in this case in my judgement is that you were distracted because you were using a mobile phone to make a business call			0
‘ you made absolutely no effort on your return to the @entity19 to surrender to the authorities			1
you probably thought you had got away with it			0
’ @entity199 insisted last night it was not common procedure to arrest a driver at the scene of a collision			0
‘ we review all wanted person files and no case like this is ever fully closed , ’ said detective constable @entity205			0
