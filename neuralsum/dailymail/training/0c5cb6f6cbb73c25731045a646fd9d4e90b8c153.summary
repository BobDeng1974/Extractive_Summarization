@entity3 , who is 19 stone and suffers from heart problems , was unable to get up after falling in her own home			1
her daughter @entity7 , 38 , dialled the ambulance trust 's non-emergency line to ask for a lifting team to assist her 78 - year - old mother			1
but when the family was told that no one from the community health team was available to attend their home in @entity17 and they would have to wait for a first responder to be dispatched from 999			2
more than five hours later , no one had arrived			1
a great - grandmother was left lying on her living room floor for more than seven hours waiting for a @entity22 ( pictured ) to arrive @entity7 said : ' i told the caller i thought this was appalling service and that my mother was now in pain			1
' they kept telling me not to feed her or give her a drink , only a sip of water , which was impossible as she was on floor			0
' it then took a further two hours before anyone arrived , a full seven after the initial call at around 4.30pm			1
@entity7 said : ' at 11.09pm i called 999 again and stated how disgusted i was and three minutes later a single paramedic arrived in a car			2
' the responder did not have lifting equipment so he had to call for another ambulance to attend as well			2
' he radioed for another pair of hands to lift my mum up and two paramedics arrived minutes after in a 4x4			0
they got mum to her feet and she was very wobbly and confused , a spokeswoman for @entity53 has since apologised for the delay and blamed a busy period of calls ' he said they had been really busy that night			0
he was brilliant but i just feel seven hours is far too long to leave someone			0
' he informed us five crews had been issued to our job but were then diverted to more serious cases en route			0
the paramedics that came were fabulous but the wait was atrocious and i feel let down			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity53 has since apologised for the delay and blamed a busy period of calls			0
' when a person falls at home and sustains no injury but needs lifting assistance , it is most appropriate for a community healthcare team to attend , ' she added			2
' unfortunately , on this occasion the community team had no one available and so the ambulance service was asked to assist			2
' during this very busy period , @entity53 received 999 emergency calls within @entity17 between 4pm and midnight on friday 19 december 2014			0
' all 999 calls must be prioritised to ensure patients suffering life - threatening emergencies receive attention as quickly as possible			0
' it is for this reason that the ambulance service was unable to get to mrs @entity3 any sooner			1
' @entity53 would like to apologise to mrs @entity3 for the time she had to wait for an ambulance to arrive			1
