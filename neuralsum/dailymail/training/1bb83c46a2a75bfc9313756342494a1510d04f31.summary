by its very nature as the lowest professional division in the country , the goings on in @entity5 are all too often an afterthought in the frantic world of @entity9 football			1
but at the bottom of the @entity12 you will find the very essence of our game			2
league two in the past housed seasoned veterans and long - ball football , but now it is the home of some of the best young talent in the country , forced to try and forge a career from the bottom up due to the influx of foreign talent in the top flight			0
clubs like @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 have set a new and encouraging trend of focusing on development rather than recruitment			0
the only way is up : @entity36 celebrate after winning the @entity5 play - off final in may what the @entity38 implore the big clubs to do is already being done in @entity5			2
twelve of @entity31 's squad of 20 have come through their academy , eight of @entity29 's squad of 19 , and seven of @entity30 's squad of 22			0
refreshingly too , financial gulfs are nowhere near as wide in @entity5 than they are higher up the pyramid , creating a level playing field and a truly unpredictable league			2
@entity52 were surprisingly relegated last season alongside @entity54 , while the quartet of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 who have come down from @entity61 will find no easy games			1
on the flip side , @entity63 and @entity64 , promoted from the @entity65 , can take solace in the fact that no side has gone straight back down from the conference since its inception			1
so you get the picture then - what @entity5 lacks in prestige it makes up for in its fluid , combustible and refreshingly @entity9 nature			2
@entity79 moment : @entity63 captain @entity81 lifts the @entity65 title squad overhauls are far more commonplace , with the vast majority of transfers being signed for free on one - year deals - @entity58 have been the busiest of the lot so far , with 16 players coming in			1
that being said , managerial changes are less frequent in @entity5 than in the leagues above			2
only three clubs changed managers in the summer , with @entity95 coming in at @entity96 , @entity97 at @entity57 and @entity98 at @entity58			1
@entity5 also houses the second - longest serving manager in the country			2
@entity101 's eight years at @entity31 is bettered only by @entity103 's near - 18 - year stay at @entity104			0
@entity101 and the rest of the league will be back in action this weekend when the season kicks off at 3pm on saturday			1
here , @entity109 previews the battles to win promotion and to stay in the @entity12 ... high profile : former @entity114 winger @entity113 has joined @entity58 the favourites @entity116 and @entity117 finished last season strongly after changing managers and , having both recruited well , look capable of automatic promotion			1
@entity116 boss @entity121 managed to persuade prolific veteran striker @entity122 to come back to @entity123 , while goalkeeper @entity124 , midfielder @entity125 and winger @entity126 have impressed at higher levels in past seasons			0
@entity129 was given the @entity117 job full - time at the end of last season after remaining unbeaten during his caretaker spell , when @entity117 won five of their final seven games to avoid relegation			1
that has given the former @entity117 captain a mandate to manouevre in the transfer market and he has added the experience of goalkeeper @entity141 , left back @entity142 and @entity143 to a squad full of young talent from their academy			0
new arrival : former @entity9 international left back @entity142 ( right ) is now at @entity117 @entity96 could also be in the automatic promotion shake - up , with a hungry @entity95 eager to prove his managerial credentials after a frustrating start to his career			1
@entity155 's first three jobs were all in difficult environments at @entity117 , @entity157 and @entity158 , so he will appreciate being in relatively serene surroundings , even though he has had to drop into the fourth tier			0
all four relegated sides will be expecting promotion challenges , but that may be a bridge too far for a @entity59 side who have been going backwards for the entirety of @entity169 's third spell in charge			1
like @entity59 , @entity56 stuck with their manager despite relegation			1
@entity173 will be under immediate pressure to challenge at the top , but he has the squad to do so			0
bossing it : new @entity96 manager @entity95 ( left ) and his @entity179 counterpart @entity178 likewise , @entity57 have not been weakened too much by relegation and have a side that hould be in the automatic promotion race right to the end			1
@entity58 's reaction to relegation was in stark contrast to that of their rivals , with a new manager and 16 players coming in			0
@entity98 needs to get his squad gelled quickly , but he will be hungry for success in @entity5 having been harshly sacked by @entity36 shortly after leading them to the @entity12 two years ago			1
the signing of former @entity196 and @entity197 wideman @entity113 could prove to be an inspired piece of business by @entity98 and @entity58			0
dark horses such is the nature of @entity5 , all 24 sides know that promotion is not beyond their reach , even if they are not expecting it or planning for it			2
@entity207 were the losing play - off finalists in may , and while their squad will have been hit hard by that defeat it has been strengthened over the summer			0
they have a top young manager in @entity212 who will be confident of a third successive top - seven finish			0
pointing the way : @entity216 goalkeeper @entity215 will hope to be part of another top - seven finish as a big - name club for this level , @entity63 's odds for promotion are artificially short , but back - to - back promotions from the conference to @entity61 have been achieved in recent history by @entity226 and @entity59			1
the loss of striker @entity228 to @entity229 will be hard - felt though and they may take a mid-table finish			0
@entity234 and @entity216 , losing play - off semi-finalists in may , will in the hunt for the top seven again and could be challenged by a cluster of improving sides from last season 's also - rans , such as @entity238 , @entity29 , @entity31 and @entity30			0
relegation battle the stats prove that this is traditionally the tightest relegation scrap in all four of @entity9 's professional leagues			0
with little to choose between all 24 clubs in terms of financial clout , and with the fact that only two teams go down , there often arises a scenario like last season , when @entity52 were relegated on the last day despite being just nine points adrift the top half of the table			0
promising : @entity254 manager @entity212 ( right ) chats to @entity256 's @entity255 before a friendly the team that escaped that day , @entity258 , could well find themselves in another relegation battle after a difficult summer in the transfer market for manager @entity263			0
@entity64 have a very inexperienced side and unless they address that they could become the first side to be relegated back to the @entity65 the season after promotion			1
if @entity64 and @entity258 are to stay up they will be looking to finish above the likes of @entity272 and @entity273 , who finished last season poorly			2
@entity116 6/4 , @entity117 13/8 , @entity63 15/8 , @entity58 11/5 , @entity275 7/2 , @entity207 7/2 , @entity30 4/1 , @entity234 4/1 , @entity56 9/2 , @entity216 9/2 , @entity59 9/2 , @entity238 11/2 , @entity96 11/2 , @entity273 6/1 , @entity57 6/1 , @entity64 7/1 , @entity276 8/1 , @entity29 8/1 , @entity277 8/1 , @entity278 , @entity279 11/1 , @entity272 14/1 , @entity258 14/1 , @entity31 18/1			1

@entity5 season kicks off with 12 *fixtures* on saturday , *august* 9 at 3pm
@entity63 and @entity64 return to the @entity12 after promotion
@entity57 , @entity56 , @entity58 and @entity59 relegated from @entity61
