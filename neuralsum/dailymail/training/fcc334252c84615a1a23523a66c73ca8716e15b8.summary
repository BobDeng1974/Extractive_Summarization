despite being seen within the four - hour waiting time , stipulated by the @entity22 constitution , mr @entity7 was forced to wait due to a bedding crisis - a familiar problem at hospitals across the @entity26			1

a 92 - year - old @entity1 veteran was forced to wait more than 26 hours in @entity2 at the @entity8 before he could be admitted to a ward when a bed became available in many cases patients , especially elderly people , can not be discharged from hospital unless a suitable rehabilitation bed is available in community hospitals and care homes - a process organised by social services			1
mrs @entity11 said the scenes in the @entity2 were ' chaotic ' on the night her father was admitted			1
' where has it all gone wrong ? , ' she said			0
' it 's just very disappointing			0

' @entity48 , my sister and my daughter went with him to the hospital and we had to take it in turns to sit with him in the corridor			1

' a gp called an ambulance for mr @entity7 , a great - grandfather who lived in sheltered accomodation in @entity64 , on december 3 when his condition began to deteriorate			1
ms @entity11 added : ' it took the ambulance 20 or 30 minutes to get to him			2
' it was a non-emergency so we thought it came in around that amount of time - and the paramedics were marvellous			2
' he was admitted to the hospital at about 3pm and stayed on the trolley until about 6pm when he was checked by doctors			2
' he was then taken to a cubicle in @entity2 where we stayed with him for another three hours			1
' we were told to go home at 9pm because they said they 'd find him a bed as soon as they could			0
' but they did n't put him on a ward until 5pm the following day			0
@entity7 ' daughter @entity11 described the scenes in @entity2 as ' chaotic ' adding that patients were facing ' unbelievable waiting times ' as a nurse serving on the front line in @entity93 she saw gunshot wounds , multiple trauma injuries , and children shot - the casualties of vicious warfare			1
every day for six months she faced shelling , caring for soldiers on trolleys as warning sirens blared in the distance , alerting them to the enemy advancing			0
for most , the stressful , unpredictable and highly pressurised conditions , are an alien concept			0
but for nurses , doctors , healthcare assistants and support staff on the front line of @entity26 's @entity22 , life at work is ' worse than conditions in a warzone '			0
a senior nurse at @entity118 's @entity117 of @entity9 , pictured , has written a brutal account of the pressures of working in @entity2 , claiming conditions are ' worse ' than serving on the front line in the @entity93 war the senior nurse claims life staffing the busiest @entity2 ward in @entity9 is worse than anything she faced in a field hospital during the second @entity93 war			1
her brutal three - page account comes after a stressful night in the department , and just a week after the latest figures revealed waiting times at @entity132 in @entity133 reached their lowest point since 2004			1
the @entity133 figures revealed just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target set in 2004			2
in @entity9 , where the @entity22 is run by @entity139 , figures for november were even worse , with just 83.8 per cent of patients being seen within four hours			2
the letter was read out at a meeting for staff with the managers at @entity118 's @entity117 of @entity9 , and pinned to a staff noticeboard			0
in it , the nurse recalls the heartbreaking moment a pregnant mother miscarried on the floor after waiting to be seen for two hours , a suicidal patient locked herself in the toilets and a woman suffered a suspected heart attack in the waiting room			2
' it was a very distressing time for the family			0
' mr @entity7 suffered a heart attack during his stay at the @entity8 , and spent both his birthday and @entity161 on the ward			1
he passed away on the morning on @entity163 , of suspected pneumonia			0
his daughter added : ' what upsets me more than anything is that he should have been treated with more respect at his age			0
' my father has worked all his life			0
' the corridor was cold and we had to find a blanket to put over him			0
' a spokesman for @entity177 said it did not comment on individual cases			0
@entity180 , head of nursing at @entity8 , said : ' we apologise to anyone who is experiencing long waits in our @entity2 departments			1
' as with all hospitals during the winter months we are dealing with increased pressures in our emergency departments with many more patients requiring admission			0
' this may result in some patients being cared for in our medical assessment area with a dedicated nurse while waiting for a bed on a ward to become available			2
' providing the highest quality patient care is our utmost priority and our staff are working tirelessly to keep waits to a minimum wherever possible			0

@entity7 was rushed to the @entity8 on december 3
