by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 trailing 1 - 0 with time fast expiring and a star striker who looks shackled and shattered , managers have a decision to make			1
when that forlorn frontman is @entity8 , the stakes are raised			2
but that is the scenario which has faced both @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity13 bosses present and past			1
one acted , one stalled			0
one won , one lost			0
afterwards , a beleaguered @entity11 offered : ‘ i think if i 'd brought him off some people would say ' what are you doing ? you are 1 - 0 down and you 're taking off your top goalscorer ”			1
’ instead , he had replaced a winger for a winger , a midfielder for a midfielder and a full - back for a full - back , all the while leaving @entity49 to wonder what influence he might have had at the expense of his laboured team - mate			2
@entity54 , in contrast , hooked @entity22 with 14 minutes remaining of @entity19 ’s second - round tie with @entity20 on sunday			1
sure , it raised eyebrows , but , significantly and to game - changing effect , it raised the energy , urgency and invention of his side			2
come full - time they were leading 2 - 1 , @entity22 ’s replacement – @entity65 - @entity66 – having assisted @entity68 ’s equaliser and kept his nerve to score the winner from the penalty spot			1
@entity54 , unlike @entity33 , had not been afraid of the subsequent scrutiny which would have arrived in the wake of a defeat			0
the comeback kings : @entity10 celebrates as @entity19 beat @entity20 late on to progress to the last eight he said : ‘ the substitution was tactical			1
let ’s not forget before he joined the team he was recovering from an injury			0
it ’s difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes , especially in these conditions			0
’ @entity66 ’s goal was the third consecutive match in which a @entity54 introduction had made the difference			0
@entity90 fired the winner in the 3 - 2 victory against @entity93 and he was again on target from the bench in the 2 - 0 success over @entity97 , fellow substitute @entity89 having opened the scoring			1
on both occasions @entity54 had made bold calls , forward depay having replaced a defender against @entity93 and playmaker @entity68 the man to make way for @entity105 against @entity97			0
such conviction characterises @entity54 , just like a lack of it ultimately undermined @entity11			2

@entity19 were losing 1 - 0 to @entity20 when @entity10 decided to replace @entity8 with @entity112
the match ended 2 - 1 to @entity19 with @entity112 scoring a vital last - minute penalty
this is in stark contrast to when @entity11 left @entity22 on the pitch whilst @entity13 were losing 1 - 0 to @entity27 in december
@entity11 stated after the match : " if i 'd brought him off some people would say ' what are you doing ? you are 1 - 0 down and you 're taking off your top goalscorer ”
