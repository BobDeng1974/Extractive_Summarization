farmers are producing ‘ designer tomatoes ’ by changing the flavour and adding @entity2 by growing them under pink led lights farmers are producing ‘ designer tomatoes ’ in a revolutionary greenhouse that can change the flavour and add vitamin c by growing them under pink led lights			1
farm technologists have discovered that changing the colour of the lights , from red to a fuchsia pink or blue , will alter the flavour , delivering a more home - grown taste			1
the new technology also means tomatoes can be grown all year round under glass , preventing the need for imports from warmer climates , such as @entity27			1
currently , 80 per cent of the tomatoes eaten in the @entity29 are imported , which generates huge transport costs and waste			1
farmers in this country have traditionally used sodium lights , which give off a white or yellow colour , in their greenhouses to extend the growing season for summer crops			1
however , it appears the leds – @entity42 – are much more effective in mimicking the sun and they can deliver different colours of light , which can intensify the flavour			2
the @entity42 also use much less energy , which means growing tomatoes and other crops in greenhouses under light through the winter becomes financially viable			1
experts at the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , are already growing tomatoes under the brightly coloured led lights at a new 1,000 square metre glasshouse			1
@entity60 , chairman of the @entity61 , said the process of photosynthesis , which is the key part of the growth process , principally uses the red and blue spectrum found in sunlight			0
‘ the led system means that we can target the colour of the light that the plant needs , rather than just giving a blanket white light , ’ he said			1
‘ in doing that we use as incredibly reduced amount of energy			0
as a result , leds offer a great opportunity to grow something very efficiently			0
’ the trials also involve growing salad leaves , strawberries and garden plants under a mix of coloured led lights			1
farm technologists have discovered that changing the colour of the lights , from red to a fuchsia pink or blue , will alter the flavour , delivering a more home - grown taste ( file picture ) the research in @entity56 is looking at specialist , highly flavoured tomatoes , such as @entity98 , a midi - plum variety , rather than the cheap bulk buy imports that tend to be bland or watery			1
some of these were grown in the glasshouse through the autumn and harvested in december before going on sale in the area in the run - up to @entity108			0
mr @entity60 said : ‘ they have been very well received due to their exceptional , just - picked taste			0
@entity98 is a lovely variety , with a deep red colour , but most importantly , that home grown flavour			2
’ @entity115 , the chief executive of the technology centre , said : ‘ basically the led gives us the advantage that you can build up your own bespoke colours of light			2
that allows you to change the flavour and shelf life			0
’ the centre is researching how changing the light and colours affects the taste and the nutritional quality of the tomato			0
there is some evidence from @entity132 that there are real benefits			0
a project between the @entity42 manufacturer @entity137 and @entity138 found that the system can produce healthier tomatoes			2
crops receiving extra light from the @entity42 contained up to twice as much vitamin c as others , even though the extra dose was equivalent to only a quarter of the natural light intensity on a sunny day			0
the @entity147 , based in @entity148 , which is one of the @entity29 ’s biggest tomato producers , is supporting the trial			2
its general manager , @entity152 , said the led system will allow the crop be grown all year round			1
‘ one of the large challenges around growing in the winter is the amount of capital involved , which can be £ 1m a hectare			0
the purpose of this trial for us to understand the technologies and see whether they deliver the returns we want , ’ he said			0
mr @entity152 told @entity165 ’s @entity167 programme that while people eat fewer tomatoes in the winter , there is still a large market			0
‘ we are importing a lot of tomatoes across the winter and having a high quality tomato that is fresh and local to market means we can get something that is better tasting for consumers , ’ he said .			2

farmers produce ' designer tomatoes ' by growing them under led lights
different colour lights alter the flavour of tomatoes and can add vitamin c
new technology allows farmers to grow their produce all year round
this means @entity29 could become less *reliant* on imported tomatoes
