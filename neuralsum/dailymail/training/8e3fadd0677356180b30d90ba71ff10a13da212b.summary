by @entity0 published : 16:11 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 29 march 2013 @entity2 , at front , performing in the @entity3 at the @entity4 with @entity5 and @entity6 my father is responsible for my entire showbusiness career			1
if he had n't pushed me to go to @entity10 in @entity11 , which was , and still is , a very good school , and then on to @entity3 i would never have discovered a talent for comedy			1
we lived in @entity16 , @entity11 ; it was just me and @entity18 as my parents had split up when i was small			1
at school , i was drawn to acting and singing , and put together the school revue in 1959 , in which i performed my own songs and sketches			0
i loved hearing an audience laugh - it was and still is a great feeling			2
when i went away to @entity3 in 1960 after winning a scholarship to @entity29 , i met @entity6 ( later to become a writing partner in @entity31 ) who was a year older than me , and we rapidly became friends			1
@entity5 was two years older than me but started at @entity33 at the same time			1
as they were both in the @entity35 , i plucked up the courage to join in my second year			2
we all got on well and spent hours at the @entity35 , rehearsing and coming up with ideas			2
as i started my third year , i was n't thinking about what my career might be			0
but during that autumn term i wrote a song about the singer @entity42 for the @entity35 termly show			2
it contained some nice word play , and luckily for me someone from the @entity46 saw it being performed			0
i then got a message to call a producer from @entity49 , the @entity46 's flagship satirical comedy show			2
suddenly i was being offered £ 30 , and one of my songs was going to be on national tv ! it was a penny - dropping moment			0
i thought , ‘ @entity56 , there might be a career here			0
' i 'd done some holiday work as a scaffolder , but now earning money as an entertainer became a possibility			0
i remember telling my dad that @entity65 , and he was a bit perplexed but pleased ; he had wanted me to be a teacher			0
i was soon bringing in more money doing cabaret performances with my @entity35 colleagues in @entity70 and @entity3 and my new career as an entertainer started to gather pace			1
@entity2 on @entity74 , left , and with his granddaughter @entity75 at a @entity70 film premiere then , to all of our surprise , our revue show a @entity80 , which was later renamed @entity3 , made it to @entity70 and we spent the next few months performing at the @entity4 to rave reviews			1
the cast was me , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			1
we then took it to @entity90 and later @entity91			0
after that i got regular writing work for radio shows before @entity95 , @entity6 and i put together @entity31 , which ran for nearly 12 years			1
i 'd never have thought i would have made it in showbusiness but luck and serendipity really played their part in what has turned out to be a marvellous career			0
@entity2 's @entity104 are available from @entity105 , @entity106 's , @entity107 and @entity108 ; see @entity109			0
