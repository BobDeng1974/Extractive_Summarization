by @entity0 published : 16:09 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 17:30 est , 12 march 2014 the restaurant manager and barman of an upmarket riverside restaurant stood before a judge today accused of killing a customer			0
the two men , along with the boyfriend of another colleague , allegedly restrained the man so forcefully that he stopped breathing and suffered a fatal heart attack			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 deny the charge of manslaughter			1
a jury heard that @entity13 and @entity15 held @entity19 down on the ground outside @entity21 in @entity22 for more than half an hour , before being joined by @entity14			1
@entity13 ( right ) , @entity14 ( right ) and @entity15 allegedly restrained a 34 - year - old man so forcefully that he stopped breathing and suffered a fatal heart attack when police arrived at the scene in @entity22 , @entity29 , they turned the unresponsive 34 - year - old over and noticed he was not breathing and his lips were blue			1
they called for an ambulance and tried in vain to revive him			0
the three defendants and barmaid @entity38 ’s girlfriend - were all arrested even though mr @entity19 was not formally pronounced dead until the following morning			1
@entity39 later charged the men with manslaughter on the grounds of using unreasonable force against their victim			0
prosecutor @entity45 told the nine women and three men on the jury : ‘ prolonged restraint of a person , involving the application of pressure to their trunk or torso , may inhibit the in - and - out movements of the chest which are essential for proper respiration			0
‘ in other words , an individual may be prevented by such pressure from fully breathing in and out			0
‘ mr @entity19 had been restrained with such force and for so long a time that ultimately he suffered a cardiac arrest , itself being brought on because during the time he was under the restraint he could not breathe properly			1
’ he told the jury at @entity68 : ‘ they are charged with the offence of manslaughter because the use of the force by which the fatal restraint was applied by them , was unlawful			1
’ mr @entity76 said that following his arrest , bar manager @entity13 had told police the victim had grabbed him and had been trying to do the same to barmaid @entity38 and get her telephone number			2
he said that fearing for his safety and that of colleagues and customers , he had restrained the man , before restaurant manager @entity15 helped to take him outside			1
meanwhile , miss @entity38 made the first of several emergency calls to @entity39			0
a jury heard that @entity13 and @entity15 held @entity19 down on the ground outside @entity21 ( pictured ) in @entity22 for more than half an hour , before being joined by @entity14 when police arrived at the scene in @entity22 , @entity29 , they turned the unresponsive drinker over and noticed he was not breathing and his lips were blue ‘ he continued to struggle violently			1
he had so much strength			0
he was lashing out at us , ’ @entity13 said in a prepared statement to the police			2
‘ we were simply trying to restrain him , desperate for the police to arrive			0
’ however , jurors watched @entity104 footage from cameras at the restaurant which showed that after the initial restraint inside the bar , mr @entity19 was lying on the floor motionless and was even dragged from the room without appearing to offer any resistance			1
accounts by other customers , @entity116 and @entity117 , on mr @entity19 ’s behaviour before and after the initial confrontation contrasted with @entity13 ’s statement , said the prosecution			1
mr @entity76 said earlier cctv footage also cast doubt on @entity13 ’s account of the victim ’s alleged aggression and behaviour towards him and @entity126			2
he said : ‘ it is submitted by the prosecution that by comparison with other available evidence as to what took place on the first floor , what was said can be demonstrated to be untrue			0
‘ things did not happen as he described to the police			0
’ once outside the bar the employees got mr @entity19 onto the ground again			1
@entity14 then arrived , having heard of the situation in a phone call with his girlfriend			2
he joined in the restraint , allowing @entity13 to return inside and make more calls to the police			2
the prosecution said it was during this time that @entity14 could be seen striking a number of blows at the victim			2
this photograph shows forensic officers on @entity152 at the time of mr @entity19 's death ‘ the prosecution submit that mr @entity14 had an agenda of his own			1
it was to punish him			0
this was not and could never have been lawful , ’ said mr @entity76			0
he accepted that by the fateful night of november 8 , 2012 , 34 - year - old @entity158 - born mr @entity19 had established a reputation as a heavy drinker and troublemaker , which had seen him barred from a number of pubs in the @entity29 town			1
he had even had a confrontation with @entity13 at the bar five months before his death and it was this which the prosecution believes played a large part in what happened			2
he urged the jury to base their findings predominantly on what happened on the night in question and not previous events			0
to do otherwise would be , he said , using a footballing analogy , ‘ to play the man rather than the ball ’ , which is what he said @entity13 had done			0
‘ he responded not to the behaviour in front of him but to the reputation , ’ he said			0
@entity13 , 26 , from @entity187 , @entity22 , @entity15 , 29 , from @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , and @entity14 , 23 , of @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity29 , all deny the single charge			1
the trial , before judge @entity195 is expected to last about two weeks			0

@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 allegedly restrained @entity19 so forcefully he stopped breathing
the jury heard mr @entity19 was held on the ground for more than half an hour outside the restaurant in @entity22 , @entity29
the three deny a charge of manslaughter at @entity68
