she found herself unable to stop blurting out ' marshmallow ' and immediately called her doctor for an appointment after she ran back to her car in shame			2
by the time she saw her gp the next day , her ticks had already increased ten-fold , and she began shouting words like ' n * * * * r ' - as well as ' @entity61 ' and ' i 'm a t * * t '			1

then i saw his hearing aid and i started saying " deaf , deaf " - it was a new tick			1
@entity3 's syndrome is a neurological condition affecting the brain and nervous system that causes sufferers to make involuntary noises and movements called tics			2
tics can be vocal - such as grunting , coughing or shouting - or physical – such as the jerking of the head or jumping up and down			2
the exact cause of @entity3 's is unknown but it can come on suddenly , usually in children or teenagers , but also in adulthood			2
it is believed the condition is brought on by a problem with the basal ganglia , which are a group of specialised brain cells located deep inside the brain			2
it is thought that the problems may be caused by excessive levels of a naturally occurring chemical called dopamine			0
another theory is that @entity3 ’s syndrome may be linked to an infection in which antibodies produced by the body to fight the infection interact with brain tissue , affecting the brain 's functioning			0
' i was like " oh god , i 'm sorry " and he said " i 'm deaf , it does n't matter what you said , i ca n't hear you "			0
' it was amazing and we just hit it off straight away			0
' one of miss @entity5 's biggest fears was staying over at his house because her ticks continue through the night - but mr @entity123 immediately put her at ease			1
' he said he turned off his hearing aid through the night so he would n't be able to hear me at all			0
i thought " this is amazing '' , she said			0
' i was keeping my mum up at night , but now the only person i keep up in the night is our dog			0
' the pair moved in with each other in july and mr @entity123 is now a carer for @entity188 , who suffers severe physical ticks , as well as her verbal outbursts			0
mr @entity123 , who has been 97 per cent deaf since contracting meningitis aged five , said : ' @entity192 completed me			0
her ticks were never a problem for me - i thought it was cute if i 'm being honest			2
' i used to get frustrated not being able to hear things properly but we even each other out			0
' things i ca n't do like phone calls she does , things she ca n't do like chop food i do			0
i could never imagine life with out her now			0
