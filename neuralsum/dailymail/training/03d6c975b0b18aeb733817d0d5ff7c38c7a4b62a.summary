@entity0 , now 15 years old , was living with her grandmother when she first met the man who would become her husband			1
' it happened when i was only 13 years old , ' she remembers			1
' my friend who had already found herself a husband convinced me into marriage			1
' shocking though it might seem , @entity0 , then barely into her teens , had agreed to marry a man old enough to be her grandfather - and a feckless alcoholic to boot			1
shocking : @entity0 , now 15 , was married off to a feckless alcoholic when she was just 13 years old extreme though it might seem , @entity0 is by no means unique			1
according to @entity20 figures , 14.2 million girls under the age of 15 are forced into marriage each year			1
most come from @entity22 , the @entity23 , and like @entity24 herself , from @entity27 - @entity26 , @entity28 , the @entity29 and her home country of @entity31 among them			1
along with an education and childhood cut short , girls suffer a traumatic initiation into sexual relationships , are put at risk of domestic violence and @entity41 's , and have the chance of a career or better life taken away			2
worse , many also die in childbirth or from pregnancy - related complications - the leading cause of death for girls aged between 15 and 19 years old in developing countries , according to @entity53 figures			2
' child marriage is an appalling violation of human rights and robs girls of their education , health and long - term prospects , ' comments @entity62 , executive director of @entity63			2
' a girl who is married as a child is one whose potential will not be fulfilled			2
' school : like other child brides , @entity0 had to leave school after her wedding - much her grandmother 's horror rescue : @entity24 , pictured with her grandmother ( centre left ) was rescued by a child protection team for @entity0 , who lived in extreme poverty with her grandmother , the thought of swapping a life of hardship for that of a wife proved enough to convince her to give up school in order to marry			1
' one day my friend came to me and asked why i was suffering , ' she remembers			0
' life was very difficult at home			0
we could not even afford soap			0
' my friend told me it would be better if i got married like her , so that my husband could take care of my needs			1
' one day , she was approached by a much older man from her village who talked of giving her a better life - one where she 'd never go hungry again			2
' he kept pursuing me to marry him , ' explains @entity0			1
' he promised to take care of me , provide whatever i wanted , and after sitting for my grade eight exams i accepted			0
' but life after her marriage was not what she was expected			0
not only was her new husband an alcoholic , he squandered any money he earned - leaving his child bride hungry			1

@entity135 source : @entity137 ' my husband was an alcoholic but because my grandmother was too poor to have me back , i decided to persevere in the marriage , ' she remembers			1
' he never kept any of his promises			0
when i asked him [ about money ] , he told me he had already paid my dowry of 37,000 kwacha ( approximately £ 65 ) and that was the money he would have used for my upkeep			0
' i regretted what i ’d done - my wish was to continue with education , but then i was helpless and had no one to support me			0
' her grandmother , who had been reluctant to allow @entity0 to marry in the first place , was furious but says she did n't know how to get her grandchild back			1
but @entity0 ' fortunes took a turn for the better when her grade eight exam results , which included passes in every subject , were released to her grandmother			1
' i cried when i received the good news about my grandchild ’s performance , ' she reveals			0
' i was happy , yet disturbed as i did n’t know what to do			0
problem : early marriage , such as this one taking place in @entity31 , are the fate 14.2 million girls every year ' i went back to school and talked to the teacher who advised me to seek help from the @entity173 in our village to bring @entity0 back home			1
' horrified by @entity0 ' tender age , the @entity173 , trained by children 's charity @entity178 , swung into action and traced the schoolgirl to her husband ’s house			1
' i was at home when some people [ the child protection committee members ] came and asked me if i was aware that i passed my exams and had been selected to join one of the best schools in my district , ' remembers @entity0			1
' they promised to contribute part of my school fee and i decided to run away while my husband was away			2
' i was afraid and thought he would come looking for me , but i have never seen him			0
the committee contributed some money and paid part of my school fee			0
' and @entity0 is by no means alone			1
@entity31 remains a country with a high number of child brides , with girls living in the north of the country at a particularly high risk of being married off to anyone who can afford their dowry			1
the end of childhood : a child bride is pictured in @entity212			0
@entity213 has told of how she suffered a similar fate when she married age 10 recently , however , tribal leaders have introduced new rules to try and reduce the number of child brides from the area and encourage more to stay in school			1
' in the past , we had our own cultures that allowed us to take a girl to a man without any question , whether young or at any age , ' explains @entity228 , a traditional leader from the @entity230 province			2
' the girl could be referred to as wealth			0
if a girl was born in a family , the father considered himself as rich			0
' but with fines of up to 60,000 kwacha ( £ 87 ) for anyone who forces a child to marry , all that could be about to change			2
' many people are afraid of breaking them because they fear the consequences as they feel the penalties are too high that they can not afford , ' adds @entity228			0
while many child brides suffer irreparable damage , for @entity24 , now 15 , her story has a happy ending			0
' i 'm happy i returned to school , even though there may be challenges			0
some day , ' she adds determinedly , ' i will be an accountant			0
' recently , two of my friends at school were planning to get married , but i discouraged them , ' she adds			2
' i told them my story , and they stopped all the marriage preparations and chose to continue with education			0
' commenting on the case , @entity260 , ceo of global children ’s rights charity , @entity261 , said : ' child marriage is a pernicious practice , which denies millions of girls their futures			1
' we know that girls who marry young are more likely to experience violence , abuse and forced sexual relations			1
they are also more likely to experience poor sexual and reproductive health , and more likely to drop out of school			0
' improving education and school retention for girls plays a crucial role in preventing early and forced marriage , and therefore helping to end the cycle of poverty and powerlessness that it causes			2
