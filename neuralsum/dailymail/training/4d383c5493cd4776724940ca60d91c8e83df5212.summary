@entity0 have missed out on a place in @entity3 final			1
the group lost out to @entity5 , after the two acts received the lowest number of votes from the public after their two performances on saturday night 's show			1
while they were picked by their mentor @entity14 and @entity16 to go through to the final , they lost out when @entity18 chose to go deadlock – allowing @entity5 who received the most public votes to go through to the final			1
missing out : @entity0 will not be going through to the @entity3 final after losing their place on sunday evening the decision means @entity5 will join @entity26 and @entity27 in the final			1
@entity14 was the first judge to cast his vote and said : ‘ this is harder than usual because the acts are so different			1
it was an emotional sing off , you ’ve both done so well			2
’ @entity35 went next and said : ‘ it ’s very simple – @entity5 ’ struggling @entity16 said : ‘ @entity5 you sang one my favourite songs tonight , you are such a diamond in the rough in this competition			1
but the act i ’m sending through is @entity0			2
’ fight : they lost out to @entity5 after @entity18 sent the vote to deadlock gracious : the group were hugely thankful for the opportunity given to them emotional : the two acts were very emotional ahead of their performances @entity18 was last to pick and after a pause said she was going to put it deadlock , meaning the act with the most votes would go through to the final , which in this case was @entity5			1
after they were voted of @entity54 , from @entity0 told @entity55 : ‘ just being here is a highlight			2
i thank @entity14 for everything he has done for us			2
’ the band then turned the audience and shouted : ‘ if you believe in us , make some noise			2
’ ca n't decide : @entity18 was unable to make a decision and sent the vote to deadlock moving : the two acts were very supportive of each other and hugged away throughout giving it their all : @entity0 performed @entity70 's @entity71 impassioned : @entity5 performed @entity72 's @entity73 @entity5 was the first act to take part in the sing - off and he sung a very impassioned version of @entity72 ’s @entity73 with his guitar in a bid to remain in the competition			1
his moving performance got a standing ovation from the judges			2
@entity0 were the second to sing – picking @entity70 's @entity71 and delighted the crowd moving around the stage			2
performing on the show was @entity3 alumni @entity87 , who famously won the show in 2006			2
shock : @entity91 could n't quite believe that @entity0 had been sent home too much : @entity27 also found the whole situation hugely emotional the 28 - year - old sung her song one more sleep from her upcoming festive album and the setting was suitably christmassy			1
while she started her performance looking like a @entity101 tree fairy with a full skirt – she took it off to reveal a sparkly @entity104 style shift dress with thigh high boots			2
she was joined on stage by dancers dressed as @entity101 trees and as various trinkets which can be found on a christmas tree and even a @entity112 in latex			2
the final three : @entity26 , @entity5 and @entity27 all looked a little shell shocked about being in the final so pleased : @entity26 and @entity18 could n't hide their happiness when they found out @entity26 was through following her performance she gave advice to the contestants : ‘ @entity122 , you ’ve just give it all you ’ve got			1
at this point it ’s all about topping every performance			0
’ when asked who she was backing , while at first she said she could n’t pick she admitted : ‘ i ’ve worked with @entity26 and we ’ve been messaging on @entity128 , so @entity26			1
’ @entity87 was followed by @entity130 crooner @entity129 , who performed alongside a full brass band			0
over the moon : @entity27 let out a scream when he found out he was through it was the second week that @entity5 found himself in the sing - off - last time it was with @entity137 but he seemed determined to give it his all on saturday evening			1
ahead of the performance , he said : ' this is a completely different version to the original , i 'm taking a big risk with this ... i 'm definitely going to channel my inner diva			0
' for this second performance of the evening he belted out @entity147 but said he was worried because the last time he sang an @entity149 song , he ended up in the bottom two			0
break down : the @entity152 singer fell to the floor as the news sunk in letting their hair down : @entity0 seemed to enjoy the group song @entity0 meanwhile sang an upbeat version of @entity160 hit , @entity161 and said the words meant a lot to them as they feel like they have been surviving the competition			0
@entity16 said : ' the semi-finals have finally begun			0
you being the excitement , the life , the energy to the show			0
this is the ' rc ' anthem			0
‘ you are survivors and you are going to survive all the way to the finals			0
' but @entity35 angered @entity16 when he said the trio should have held something back			0
all together now : @entity26 , @entity5 and @entity27 sung together @entity101 cheer : before the dreaded votes @entity129 took to the stage @entity18 agreed with him and said : ' ok , perfect song for you , you bring a good spirit to the show			1
it 's all overload for me , people humping the floor , backpacks			0
. just pull the reigns in a bit			0
' but @entity14 scoffed : ' this is not the time to pull the reigns in , it 's the semi-final			0
the vibe in this room suddenly went up 10 gears			0
' for their second song they picked @entity201 , but admitted they were concerned that what @entity149 does as an artist is very different to what they would do			0
fairy : @entity87 looked like a @entity101 fairy when she performed on the show the moment of truth : the @entity3 judges looked a little apprehensive as they made their way on stage it was perhaps only fitting that in the worst series of @entity3 for years , the best act in the semi final was sent home			1
@entity0 ’s posturing , emoting and crotch thrusting may have been so overboard that they looked ludicrous , but their versions of songs by @entity224 and @entity149 were easily the best on saturday night			0
i ’m a @entity161 was modern and energetic and @entity201 was stripped down and , unusually for this competition , in tune			0
by contrast young @entity27 ’ rendition of @entity230 was judged by everyone on the panel to be ‘ pitchy ’ and too weedy			1
he admitted himself that he could n’t connect with the song ‘ because i ’ve never had my heart broken or been in love ’ - except perhaps with his teddy bear			0
@entity26 ’s attempt to take on @entity239 left her looking less like a @entity87 or @entity241 than a rather ordinary wedding singer			1
as for @entity5 , his caterwauling version of @entity243 was so painful it was comical			1
@entity27 and @entity5 have seemingly been voted for on their youth and , in @entity27 ’ case , as @entity35 kept reminding the audience at every opportunity , because he was from @entity152			1
@entity26 seems to be universally popular with viewers because she ’s so nice			1
@entity0 will probably be more successful than all of them because there ’s a huge gap in the market for a @entity259 version of @entity70 or a more grown - up @entity260			0
but in terms of winning it , their big mistake was to think @entity3 was a contest about singing .			0

@entity18 took the vote to deadlock , with @entity5 sent through with most public votes
@entity5 will join @entity26 and @entity27 in the final
