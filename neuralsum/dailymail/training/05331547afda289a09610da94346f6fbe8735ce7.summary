by @entity0 published : 19:27 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 19:27 est , 26 august 2013 the number of workers aged over 50 has hit record levels , with two million more in jobs than just 15 years ago			1
it is estimated that by 2020 a third of the workforce will be over 50 as people remain in good health and live longer			1
ministers say older workers have a wealth of skills that are key to strengthening the economy and have told businesses to do more to retain them			1
mature workers : the number of employees aged 50 to 64 has reached 7.7 million however , charities say the increasing retirement age , family breakdown and cuts to pension schemes have forced some older people to stay in work longer than they had planned			1
figures from the @entity27 show the number of people aged 50 to 64 in employment has reached 7.7million – even higher than before the recession			0
while the number in this age group will have risen , the proportion in work is believed to be higher than at any time before			0
pensions minister @entity36 said : ‘ older workers are not only essential in meeting the long - term demand for labour in our country , they are also an opportunity to add value to business and drive our economy forward			1
‘ far from blocking jobs for younger workers , the over-fifties can help to mentor and develop new recruits and apprentices and maximise productivity across the workforce			1
’ since october 2011 no employee can be asked to leave a job simply because they have reached the age of 65 , which means they can work into their 70s and beyond			0
balancing the books : cuts to pension schemes are forced some older people to stay in work longer than they planned employers were warned by the @entity27 earlier this year that they must hire more mature staff as @entity68 is ‘ running out of workers ’ , with 13.5million vacancies predicted in the next decade – but only seven million young people due to leave education			1
ministers believe the gap can be filled by older people			0
around 22 per cent of people are aged over 60 , but by 2035 it is expected to rise to 28 per cent			0
the figures out yesterday showed the average age at which men leave work has risen from 63.1 in 1993 to 64.8 today			0
for women it is up from 60.9 to 62.6			0
fading dream : many more over 50s and 60s are having to put back their retirement plans for men and women the state pension age will rise to 66 by 2020 , and to 67 as soon as 2025 – a decade earlier than planned			2
a government guide issued to employers says : ‘ older people are the main untapped source of labour : unlike migrants , they already live here , and their numbers are growing			2
’ @entity98 , of the charity @entity99 , said a number of factors explain the rising number of older workers , including lifestyle , finances and marital status			1
she added : ‘ it is great to see more people aged 50 - plus in the workforce			2
older people have a wealth of experience and skills which contributes significantly to businesses and the economy			0
’ a recent survey found 14 per cent of people did not know when they would ever be able to retire , with those aged 65 and over not expecting to give up work until the age of 71			0
but mr @entity36 insisted he did not want to promote a culture of ‘ work till you drop ’			2
he said : ‘ this is actually enabling people to carry on and in most cases that is good for their wellbeing as well			0
’ tests by the @entity128 in @entity129 on more than 200 workers found those aged over 65 performed better than those in their 20s in speed and memory exercises , and their work was more consistent with fewer ‘ bad days ’ at the office			2
@entity140 ’s , which employs more than 1,000 staff aged over 60 , reported 20 per cent higher performance at restaurants with older workers .			1

by 2020 a third of the workforce will be over 50
employers have been warned they must hire mature staff as @entity68 is ‘ running out of workers ’
however , older workers are also staying because of pension cuts
