@entity1 biologist @entity0 says , ' cells are living computers and @entity4 is a programming language , ' but warns that this could lead to viruses and bacteria used to ' hack ' human minds the field of ' synthetic biology ' is in its infancy			1
we can ' tweak ' the genetics of life forms - but billionaire entrepreneur @entity15 only created ' artificial life ' for the first time last year , christening his life form ' @entity19 '			0
but experts working within the field believe that our expertise is out - accelerating natural evolution by a factor of millions of years - and some warn that synthetic biology could spin out of control			1
it could lead , says @entity0 of @entity28 , on @entity30 's research campus , to a world where hackers could engineer viruses or bacteria to control human minds			1
@entity0 believes that genetic engineering is the next frontier of computing			0
' this is one of the most powerful technologies in the world , ' says @entity0 ' synthetic biology - the writing of life			1
' ' i advocate that cells are living computers and @entity4 is a programming language			0
' ' i want to see life programmed and used to solve global challenges so that humanity can achieve a sustainable relationship within the biosphere , ' he @entity52 's growing fast			0
it will grow faster than computer technologies			1
' he predicts a world where we can ' print ' dna , and even ' decode ' it			0
but he warned , in a speech at technology conference @entity61 , that viruses and bacteria send chemicals into human brains - and could be used to influence , or even ' control ' their host			1
a literal virus - injected into a ' host ' in the guise of a vaccine , say - could be used to control behaviour			2
@entity0 warns that we ' may have to learn how to counterattack ' against such weapons			2
could ' artificial life ' pose a threat to humanity ? security expert @entity80 said , ' synthetic biology will lead to new forms of bioterrorism , ' and said , ' bio-crime today is akin to computer crime in the early @entity85 , @entity86 initially recognised the problem - but it grew exponentially			1
' when billionaire entrepreneur @entity15 ' created life ' last year by adding synthetic dna to a bacteria cell , professor @entity89 , an @entity90 ethicist , said : ' @entity15 is creaking open the most profound door in humanity 's history , potentially peeking into its @entity97 could be used in the future to make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable			2
the challenge is to eat the fruit without the worm			0
' @entity0 , however , is generally optimistic about the future of synthetic biology			1
the scientist - who had a vasectomy because he ' never trusted the process ' of natural reproduction , says , ' we are going to make synthetic genomes - human genomes			2
it will make cloning look organic			0
it will make human reproduction look quaint			0
' @entity118 blogger @entity117 says , ' i know people who ca n't even keep their computers protected , updated and patched - i wonder if they would be more security minded when the hacking could be lethal ? '			0

synthetic biology is ' out - accelerating evolution ' - expert
bio-crime today is ' like computer crime in the @entity85 '
viruses could be used to influence behaviour - and we may have to ' learn how to counterattack '
' one of the most powerful technologies in the world '
