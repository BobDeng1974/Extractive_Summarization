@entity0 fears he may have become a victim of his own stoicism after spending more time than he would like on the fringes for both club and country			1
@entity0 has struggled to command regular first - team football at @entity7 under manager @entity8 and has lost a grip on his @entity11 place as a result			1
typically , @entity0 knuckled down and fought his way back into @entity8 ’s team but has to admit there have been times when he wondered if his professionalism counted against him , making him easier to drop than more volatile team - mates			1
@entity0 ( left ) , pictured playing for @entity7 against @entity19 , has started the last four matches for his club despite his current form , @entity0 has struggled to cement a place in the first teams of both @entity7 and @entity11 ‘ there are two ways to react — a right and a wrong way , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you can sulk and mouth off or work harder and working harder is the only way i know			0
‘ maybe it counts against you if you ’re not sulking or ruining training if the manager leaves you out			2
i ’m not naming names			0
i ’ve played with enough players for you to decide who it can be			2
‘ maybe that does count against me at times			2
the manager knows i ’ll just carry on training as hard as i can			0
it ’s no good for the team if someone sulks or disrupts training			2
‘ the team comes first , whether it is @entity11 or @entity7			1
it is no good for the team if you do alienate yourself from the group and start making things difficult			2
’ @entity0 ( second left ) believes that the good of the team is more important that personal performance the 28 - year - old believes his professionalism could have hindered his career for @entity7 @entity0 has started @entity7 ’s past four matches in the @entity55 and his form has impressed but lack of action in 2014 did not help his international career in @entity60 year			1
he won his 50th @entity11 cap in @entity62 last month and yet the 28 - year - old has played only 223 minutes for the national team in 2014			1
the only games he started were a friendly against @entity67 , when he was used as an experimental right back , and the final group game in @entity70 against @entity71 , when the team ’s fate was sealed			1
‘ it ’s a dilemma for the @entity11 manager ( @entity75 ) , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s difficult when someone ’s not playing much at club level and he is seeing other people playing every week			0
it ’s definitely frustrating but on the other hand it ’s @entity11			1
@entity0 believes that volatile teammates could be more likely to get picked ahead of someone who stays quiet @entity0 made his 50th @entity11 appearance last month , but has only managed 223 minutes in the whole of 2014 ‘ i do n’t think i could ever turn my back on my country and look back thinking i ’d stopped , just to have a few extra days off			1
‘ it ’s a massive honour to play for your country			0
i played 46 times for the under - 21s and never would have turned it down			1
’ friends have jokingly tried to persuade him to shed the reputation which inspired the @entity97 parody @ @entity98 , an account which was recently posting tweets about the virtues of skimmed and semi-skimmed milk			0
‘ people get a tag and it sticks , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that ’s the way it is			0
if i change my @entity109 accent , it might change something but i ’m stuck with that and proud of it			0
‘ at times , i do think if i was a bit lazier , just did the attacking side of the game , would people notice me more ? but i play the game which is best for the team			2
i track back , i defend and sometimes might not have the energy to go forward because you ’re doing that work			0
@entity0 is professional in his approach to the game , and thinks he plays the game which is best for the team @entity8 has selected @entity0 ( right ) for @entity7 's last four @entity55 matches ‘ if i feel i ’m not getting a fair crack of the whip i do go and see the manager			1
that ’s the way i ’ve always done it			0
football is all about opinions			0
people who do n’t rate you ... i try to change their mind			0
‘ this is my fifth season at @entity136 and , with the trophies i ’ve won , and to be there , to hold my own , i ca n’t be doing too badly			0
’ @entity0 has survived an exodus of @entity11 players from the @entity141 — @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 have all left the club			1
he is out of contract at the end of the season and in talks about a new deal			0
he added : ‘ i seem to go through phases in my @entity7 career where at times i ’ve played a lot and enjoyed it massively and there ’s no place you ’d rather be			1
it ’s an amazing club , why would you want to leave ? ‘ then at other times it ’s a bit more frustrating when you ’re not playing as much and it ’s a bit more difficult			0
’ @entity0 has even taken the step of learning to speak @entity167 to help him bond with signings from @entity169 and @entity170 , as well as @entity172 manager @entity8			2
‘ i always wanted to learn another language , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ a few of the lads do n’t speak great @entity176 , so it helps them and helps me improve , too			0
i do n’t think you can be fluent until you live in a country but i can speak it ok			0
