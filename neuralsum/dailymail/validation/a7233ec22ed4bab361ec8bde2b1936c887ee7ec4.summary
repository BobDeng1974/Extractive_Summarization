while scientists have theories about how fish first crawled onto land and breathed air , it 's a mystery as to how vertebrates evolved tongues instead of feeding using suction			1
but now , a slow - motion video of mudskippers eating shrimp may help reveal the evolutionary secret			1
it shows the creatures , which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground , taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue , allowing them to swallow food on land			1
it shows the creatures , which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground ( pictured in a stock image ) taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue , allowing them to swallow food on land experts believe the finding may shed light on how terrestrial tetrapods - four - legged vertebrates - with tongues evolved from fish between 400 and 250 million years ago			1
when underwater , mudskippers suck water containing food particles into their mouths , which are swallowed when they reach the back of their throats , @entity48 reported			2
however , this method does n’t work on land , so terrestrial vertebrates evolved tongues to move the food to the back of the throat			1
a team of researchers led by @entity63 at the @entity64 , @entity65 , captured slow - motion x-ray footage ( shown ) of @entity68 mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water the video revealed that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish ( stock image left ) with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians such as nexts ( right ) , meaning they could reveal a missing evolutionary link mudskippers are members of the gobies family , which is one of the largest fish families comprising more than 2,000 species			1
they are completely amphibious that can use their pectoral fins to walk on land			2
they appear to move in a series of ' skips ' and can use their muscular bodied to catapult themselves two feet ( 60cm ) in the air			0
mudskippers are uniquely adapted to intertidal habitats , meaning that they do n't have to hide in rock pools or retreat when the tide goes out			0
they feed out of water and even fight to defend their territories			0
the creatures breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth and throat , but this only works when mudskippers are wet , limiting them to humid and watery habitats			2
enlarged gill chambers enable them to retain a bubble of air and they close tightly when the animal is out of water to keep gills moist			0
a team of researchers led by @entity63 at the @entity64 , @entity65 , captured slow - motion x-ray footage of @entity68 mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water			1
they found that it takes the gelatinous creatures less than half a second to pounce and eat			2
by watching the video , which was slowed down 50 times , the experts were able to see that the mudskippers carry water in their mouths			1
they spit it forward to grab the shrimp and then suck it back into their mouths quickly , to mimic the action of a tongue			0
the team also placed food on an absorbent surface and found that the mudskippers could still grab the food using their unusual technique , but had problems swallowing it			0
the scientists worked out that mudskippers move the hyoid bone in the floor of their mouth upwards , before they attempt to gulp down food			0
their finding is reported in @entity152 b : biological sciences and is the opposite of what fish do underwater			0
however , it closely resembles the feeding habits of newts , which have tongues			0
this means that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians , so they could reveal a missing evolutionary link			1
dr @entity63 said : ‘ this could be an in - between , from which a fleshy tongue could have evolved			2
‘ this has never been considered a possibility , until now .			0

slow motion video captured by @entity64 researchers shows mudskippers eat on land with the help of a glob of water
amphibious creatures take a mouthful of water that acts like a tongue
find could help solve the evolutionary mystery of how tongues evolved
