by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured , put the bottle containing sulphuric acid into his pocket when he was going to clean a drain , unfortunately the plastic container melted causing serious burns a workman suffered severe burns after his leg was soaked in sulphuric acid - which burned through an @entity13 bottle			1
@entity1 , 46 , needed two skin grafts after putting the drinks bottle into his pocket unaware that colleague @entity17 had filled it with the highly - corrosive liquid			1
a court heard how his colleague decanted the heavy - duty drain cleaner from its container and left it next to a sink at the @entity26 warehouse at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
both mr @entity1 and his colleague believed the substance in the bottle to be a less corrosive drain cleaner			1
after feeling his leg burning , mr @entity1 removed it and threw it away , before rushing to the toilets where he put cold water on his leg			1
the pain stopped as his nerve endings were damaged , so mr @entity1 went home and walked the dog before going to hospital on june 20 last year			1
he was kept in hospital for ten days and even had to spend two hours in a special decontamination unit			0
mr @entity1 believes he was sacked as a result of the accident			1
he said he tried to return to work three times but each time he was told he was suspended without pay , before finally losing his job			2
he said : ' i ’ve been out of work since and it ’s going to take two to four years for it to fully heal			1
' @entity55 , from @entity56 , @entity57 , and mr @entity1 have since lost their jobs at the warehouse			1
@entity17 , who was a representative of the company ’s @entity61 committee and had undergone @entity63 to @entity61 ( @entity65 ) training , denied giving the acid to mr @entity1 , but said it had been left unattended			1
he admitted two counts of breaching @entity61 regulations			0
@entity70 , defending , said the sulphuric acid had only been in use at the facility for a week , replacing a weaker drain cleaner which had been previously used			1
mr @entity70 said : ' he put it into what he accepts now was not an appropriate container with the intention of going to clean the drain			1
' he had certainly not realised that the new chemical which had been used from the week was considerably stronger and more caustic than the previous drain cleaner			0
mr @entity1 suffered extensive burns , pictured , following the accident and has needed two skin grafts			1
according to medics it may take two years for the injuries to heal ' although this is an offence that led to quite a bad injury , it is a case where the difficulty arose because of unfortunate error of judgement not through deliberate effort			2
' in effect , he had to find a smaller container than the new large one that had been used from that week to find some chemical to apply to a blocked drain			2
' mr @entity1 said he was also in the process of taking the company to an industrial tribunal , and although he and @entity17 used to be friends , they had not contacted each other since the incident last year			1
magistrates ordered @entity55 to carry out 60 hours unpaid work in the community and to pay £ 300 towards prosecution costs , and a £ 60 victim surcharge			0
the court heard a civil action was also underway , over the matter of compensation for the injured man			0
@entity119 , senior enforcement officer at @entity120 , said : ' this case demonstrates that @entity120 will prosecute where health and safety regulations have been breached , and particularly when serious injuries are the consequences			0
' the magistrates recognised the gravity of the matter and i am satisfied with their findings			0
' mr @entity1 's colleague @entity17 filled the @entity13 bottle , pictured , with sulphuric acid			1
the company had previously used a less caustic drain cleaner that did not melt plastic bottles speaking after the case , mr @entity1 said : ' they sacked me for attempted theft of chemicals but i never stole anything			1
' i asked my colleague what he was doing and he said he was clearing a drain			2
i had a blocked drain at home so i asked him if i could have some of the drain cleaner he was using			0
mr @entity1 said he has been scarred for life , pictured , after the accident and is currently in the process of taking a civil case against his former employers ' he gave me a bottle but i did n't know what the substance was inside			1
he left it on the side for me			0
i was leaving work so i put the bottle in my pocket with my keys			0
as i was walking out of the warehouse , the bottle burst			2
' he said he tried to clean the acid from his leg with water before going home			2
' i had no idea what it was so i did n't think it would be that bad			0
if i 'd have known , i would n't have put my trousers back on but i did , which must have made it worse			0
' i drove home wearing the trousers that were covered in acid and then washed them out			2
' when he arrived in hospital , doctors asked him what what had caused the injuries and they transferred him to a decontamination unit for two hours before moving him to the burns unit			0
' a couple of days later i had the first skin graft			0
they gave me a spinal anaesthetic so i actually watched the whole thing			0
i was sent home ten days later but i had to keep going back to have the dressings changed			0
' mr @entity1 said : ' i tried going back to work about four weeks after it happened because i was n't getting sick pay so i needed the money			1
as soon as i walked through the door , i was suspended			0
i tried to go back another three times but each time , i was suspended again until i was sacked			0
' they also said i had breached the handling of chemicals but i was never trained in that any way so i could n't have breached it			0
' mr @entity1 said he has n't seen his colleague since the accident but does not blame him for his misfortune			1
he added : " @entity17 and i always used to talk			2
we got on , and we 'd chat about the rugby			0
' when it happened , @entity17 was by my side but he just left me to it and i went to the toilet to try and wash it off			2
' i do n't blame @entity17			2
i do n't believe he was trained properly			0
' mr @entity1 's colleague transferred some of the sulphuric acid from the container , pictured to a small 500ml @entity13 bottle so he could take some of the liquid home to clean his own drains			1

@entity1 needed two skin grafts after the acid badly burned his leg
colleague @entity17 filled the soft drink container with sulphuric acid
@entity230 told that mr @entity1 's leg may take a further two years to heal
both men have lost their jobs at the @entity236 's warehouse in @entity28
