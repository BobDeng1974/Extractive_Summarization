many young adults have a horrible feeling that , come middle age , they will develop the sartorial habits and odd tics of their parents			2
and they are right – except it happens even earlier than they expect			2
in fact , most find themselves turning into their own mother or father at the tender age of 32			1
and the reason ? they have children of their own			2
@entity19 , 32 , should be morphing into her mother @entity21 , right , any day now a survey by website @entity23 listed 50 ‘ giveaway behaviours ’ that show you are turning into your own parent , from preferring estate cars over hatchbacks to realising the bins go out more often than you do			1
mothers admitted ‘ fancying children ’s tv presenters over rock stars ’ and thinking 6am is a ‘ time for getting up , not getting in ’			0
they also cited not knowing a single song in the charts and having handbags crammed with baby wipes and toys			0
fathers said they stop buying casual clothes , leave @entity44 because they are jealous of childless friends ’ excitement - filled posts and find that air travel is no longer any fun at all			0
young adults : prince @entity51 and his wife @entity52 both turn 32 next year other giveaways included finding day - old cups of tea and worrying about a daughter ’s future boyfriends			1
more than nine in ten of the 1,092 parents surveyed said their children had changed everything for them			0
two - thirds suffered from lack of sleep , six in ten complained of the cost and more than eight in ten said they no longer had any free time			0
but many reported a positive effect , with a third describing themselves as ‘ more tolerant ’ and a similar proportion saying they cared more about their community			0
@entity23 founder @entity73 said : ‘ parenting is the great leveller			2
whatever your class or job or education , or wherever you live , if you ’re a mum or dad you ’ll do certain things which mark you out as a parent			0
’ the results echo prince @entity51 ’s comments that the arrival of his son @entity86 had changed his life			1
he and @entity52 both turn 32 next year			1
perhaps they already feel as though they are turning into @entity90 and @entity91 .			1

@entity19 is 32 , so will already be turning into @entity21
*duchess* of @entity95 , *31* , has a year before becoming @entity91
