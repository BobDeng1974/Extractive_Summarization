' it was delivered about five days early so it makes you wonder what size it would have been if the pregnancy had gone to term			1
' we have had big lambs before but i have never seen anything like this			0
' as soon as it was delivered the vet weighed it straight away and she was just smiling because of how big it was			2
' @entity37 and i guessed about eight or nine kilograms - we could n't believe it when she said 11			0
it is about the size of a three or four - week - old lamb			1
' the previous record holder for the biggest lamb in the @entity1 was @entity45 , born in @entity46 in 2013			2
@entity15 , 18 , said : ' the ewe went into labour early and we did n't even have a chance to deliver naturally			0
' we had to take it to the vet for a caesarean because of the size of the lamb			1

the ewe is doing well too			0
they are together but she just ca n't keep up with the lamb 's demand for milk because it is so big			2

the mammoth lamb was born ( left ) at @entity5 in @entity6 , north @entity7 , on tuesday and had to be delivered via caesarean section			1
@entity15 ( right ) , who works on the farm with parents @entity17 and @entity19 , said : ' the lamb is absolutely huge ' the lamb 's mother ( left ) can not keep up with its demand for milk , so it has to be given a bottle by @entity15 as well ' i think it is the biggest to have ever been born in the @entity1			2
i did some research online and a lamb called @entity45 was born a few years ago at 24lbs , so ours is 2oz heavier			2
' the biggest lamb born at the farm previously was around eight kilograms			0
the family are now considering whether to send an application to the @entity89 to have @entity3 's record claim substantiated .			0
