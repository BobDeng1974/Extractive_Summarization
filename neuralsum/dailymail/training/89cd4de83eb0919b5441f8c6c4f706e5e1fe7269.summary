by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 15:24 est , 19 december 2012 one is a newly - pruned tree , the other is @entity3 , a cartoon @entity5 from the popular @entity6			1
but can you tell which is which ? walkers in the woods near @entity11 , @entity12 , were surprised to see their favourite cartoon character staring down at them today			0
spot the difference : the pruned tree , left , bears an uncanny likeness to cartoon character @entity3 , right photographer @entity18 , who took the picture of the tree , said : ' i was out taking some pictures of the weather in the woods when i saw this tree that appeared to be staring at me			1
' i thought it looked a bit like a voodoo mask at first , and it felt quite spooky out there in the woods			0
but when i got closer i saw it looked even more like @entity3 from @entity6			1
' i have never seen a tree look like a cartoon character before			1
' @entity3 is the skinny , asthmatic @entity5 with huge bulging eyes who stars in the @entity35 cartoon series he shares with his sidekick @entity36 , a dim - witted cat			2
in the show , @entity3 is quick to anger and usually takes it out on @entity36 by slapping him in the face or beating him up			0
the animated series was hugely popular both here and in its native @entity44 , and ran for five seasons in the 1990s			2
centred on characters created by @entity47 , @entity6 developed a cult following despite attracting criticism for its off - colour jokes , sexual innuendo and violence			0
the show has been credited with paving the way for satirical , animated shows like @entity56 and @entity57 .			0
