imagine a world where you no longer have to spend hours putting together @entity3 furniture			0
instead , that flat - packed table you purchased will instantly unfold into the right shape while you sit back and relax			0
now , the @entity6 is hoping to make this a reality by providing an $ 855,000 ( £ 528,000 ) grant to develop @entity10 printing technology			1
@entity10 printing uses 3d printing - a process that works in a similar way to a laser printer , building a solid object from a series of layers with each one printed directly on top of the previous one			1
the concept draws inspiration from nature which has the ability to self - replicate and repair itself in response to external environmental conditions			0
the technology has the potential to dramatically change processes in construction and manufacturing and could make it easier to build in extreme environments			0
the @entity6 is hoping 4d printing will lead to materials that allow cars to change their structure or a fabric that enables a soldier ’s uniform to alter its camouflage			1
the research grant has been awarded to a trio of university researchers from the @entity58 ’s @entity57 , @entity59 , and the @entity60			1
3d printing , also known as additive manufacturing , is a process that works in a similar way to a laser printer , by building a solid object from a series of layers with each one printed directly on top of the previous one			2
@entity10 printing takes 3d printing one step further by allowing 3d - printed materials to be programmed to self - assemble into different shapes over time			1
it can do this , for instance , by varying water - absorbing characteristics in parts of the material that activate a change in shape when they come into contact with moisture			1

the three scientists will combine their expertise to manipulate materials at nano and micro levels in order to produce , via 3d printing , materials that can modify their structures over time			2
‘ rather than construct a static material or one that simply changes its shape , we ’re proposing the development of adaptive , biomimetic composites that reprogramme their shape , properties , or functionality on demand , based upon external stimuli , ’ said principal investigator @entity105			0
co-investigator @entity116 added that current 3d printing technology allows the researchers to build in complicated functionality — not just throughout an entire structure , but also within specific areas of the structure			2
‘ if you use materials that possess the ability to change their properties or shape multiple times , you do n’t have to build for a specific , one - time use , ’ she explained			1
the research will use responsive fillers embedded within a hydrogel			0
they claim this will open up new routes for producing the next generation of smart sensors , coatings , textiles , and structural components			0
@entity10 printing takes 3d printing one step further by allowing 3d - printed materials to be programmed to self - assemble into different shapes over time ‘ the ability to create one fabric that responds to light by changing its colour , and to temperature by altering its permeability , and even to an external force by hardening its structure , becomes possible through the creation of responsive materials that are simultaneously adaptive , flexible , lightweight , and strong , ’ said @entity148 ’s @entity147			1
‘ it ’s this ‘ complicated functionality ’ that makes true @entity161 printing a game changer			0
’ earlier this year , architect @entity163 announced a project to develop morphing materials using 4d printing			2
in collaboration with @entity170 - based group @entity169 , @entity163 set up a radical lab at the @entity172 ( @entity172 ) to create materials that self - assemble			1
in a similar way to the @entity6 ’s project , @entity163 is aiming to use of multi-material 3d printing to programme different properties into various parts of a product ’s geometry			2
the idea is that these parts will have varying water - absorbing characteristics that activate a change in shape when they come into contact with moisture .			1

@entity10 printing enables 3d - printed materials to be programmed to self - assemble
it can do this , for instance , by varying material *'s* water - absorbing qualities
this activates shape change when material come into contact with moisture
@entity6 has awarded £ 528,000 to the @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 to develop the technology
