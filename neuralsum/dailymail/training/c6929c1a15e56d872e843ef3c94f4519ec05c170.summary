but mr @entity1 sparked anger when he dismissed the calls as ' ridiculous frippery '			2
miss @entity49 said : ' the first minister has to explain where he spent that money , because he should understand in the real world the people of @entity13 will be disgusted at how the first minister treats himself at their expense			0
' can he now have at least the decency of explaining to them how he spent , in just one week , the taxpayers ’ money which he still has n’t accounted for			0
” but mr @entity1 replied : ' there were , in my memory , 17 people in the @entity66 delegation			1
that is the expenditure in terms of the flights and accommodation for 17 people			0
' ' the visit was not just about the two days of the @entity3			0
the visit stretched over the range of events in @entity16 to attract investment to @entity13			0
luxury : the first minister stayed at the five - star @entity14 in @entity16 , pictured pricey : located in @entity80 , the hotel features a spa and a swimming pool ' the investment to @entity13 that was announced in that trip was worth tens of millions of pounds and brought jobs to many areas of @entity13			1
' all that justifies a substantial effort to promote this country and this ridiculous frippery we get from @entity42 '			0
the first minister and his entourage spent almost half - a - million pounds of taxpayers ’ money to go to the @entity3			2
the £ 468,581 ‘ @entity97 ’ bill included £ 80,264 on accommodation and £ 54,192 for flights			0
the true cost to taxpayers will be even higher , as @entity102 and @entity103 and @entity104 also sent representatives to @entity16			2

stylish : mr @entity1 defended the trip to the hotel , pictured , for the handover of the @entity3 she said the @entity14 was described as being ' for those who love to spoil themselves with a luxurious five - star experience without losing that comfortable home away from home feeling '			1
she added : ' for the first minister to dismiss questions about how he spent £ 54,000 on a trip to the golf as " ridiculous frippery " shows just how out of touch @entity1 is with the real lives of the people of @entity13			2
' in just a week he spent more than twice what the average @entity118 earns in a year			1
' he can not tell us why he chose to stay in a five star luxury hotel at the taxpayers ’ expense in @entity16 rather than the one @entity13 government officials were staying in			0
' @entity1 can not account for how thousands of pounds of public money was spent			0
' the people of @entity13 wo n’t see asking him to account as " ridiculous frippery " – but they will fear that thousands of their money was spent by @entity1 on ridiculous fripperies			0

' there were various business meetings which were held at the @entity14 and there was a block booking made at the @entity14 in order to get best value for that			0
' he stayed there some of the time when he was in @entity16 for the business meetings , but when he was attending the golf at the @entity3 itself he was staying at a different hotel , which was the same hotel everyone stayed at for the golf at @entity191			1
