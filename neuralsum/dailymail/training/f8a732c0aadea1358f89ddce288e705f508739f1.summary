by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:23 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 7 april 2013 the government has been ordered to pay compensation for the ‘ injustice ’ of inflicting misery on an elderly couple who were left without heating for three years by a bungled state - sponsored energy programme			1
@entity8 told a parliamentary watchdog his three - bedroom home had become a ‘ hell house ’ , with his dying wife @entity12 forced to wear her coat indoors and go to bed early in a desperate attempt to get warm			1
a boiler installed under @entity19 ’s £ 2.4billion @entity18 scheme broke down after just six months , beginning a tortuous battle to have it fixed which lasted through three bitterly cold winters			1
a damning report found both the @entity23 and its contractor @entity24 guilty of ‘ maladministration ’ , accusing them of inflicting ‘ distress and physical and material hardship ’ on an ‘ elderly and vulnerable ’ couple			1
@entity8 and @entity31 signed up to the @entity18 scheme in 2009 to update their heating system , but endured three years of misery after it stopped working			1
mrs @entity31 died in october , having never seen the problem fixed as a result of three years of excuses , mistakes and unresolved complaints , mr @entity8 experienced ‘ distress and physical and material hardship ’ which would have been ‘ amplified because he also had to watch his wife , who was unwell , also suffer ’ , the @entity38 said			1
mrs @entity31 , 85 , died from tongue cancer in october			1
the inquiry was told that one of the last things she said to her husband while being treated in hospital was to ask if the heating problems had been fixed			0
the @entity38 ordered @entity23 to pay mr @entity31 £ 1,000 in addition to a raft of remedial work at the property in @entity59 , north @entity60 to put right the mess left by @entity24 after installing the boiler in 2009			1
the contractor repeatedly refused to put the problem right , and only acted after a complaint was made to the @entity38 about the dysfunctional @entity66			2
mr @entity8 , who turned 90 on saturday , told @entity1 that after three years without heating and the death of his wife he was forced to move out of his home altogether after during the unusually cold winter at the end of 2012			1
‘ it was grim ’ , he said			0
‘ i had electric heaters going but it did n’t make any difference			0
it was so cold it was unbelievable			0
i moved out and was staying with my daughter			0
’ @entity23 was severely criticised for its role in the ‘ emotional and physical distress ’ the couple suffered ’			2
the ministry first learned of the problems in october 2010 , but it took two years before a remedy was found and the house had already been without heating for a year			0
@entity19 mp @entity86 , a former environment minister , said : ‘ this was more than incompetence and maladministration			0
‘ it was a heartless refusal to help an elderly couple whose home @entity24 had wrecked under a government scheme that was supposed to keep them safe and warm			1
‘ i am delighted that the @entity38 has now secured substantial compensation for mr @entity8			1
the only tragedy is that his wife passed away just before @entity98 and did not survive to see the @entity38 ’s report			0
’ the couple live in mr @entity86 ’s @entity102 constituency			0
the boiler was installed in 2009 but six months later it stopped working , leaving the @entity104 without heating for three years ( file picture ) mr @entity8 would often wear a coat in the house and wore a dressing gown to bed , which had an electric blanket and three further blankets on top			1
the couple would go to bed during the day , not to sleep but to keep warm while running up electricity bills using heaters to warm the kitchen – where they ‘ effectively lived ’ as the only room they were able use comfortably			0
getting dressed was ‘ horrible ’ and the experience reminded mr @entity8 of ‘ wartime ’ , he told the ombudsman			2
the devastating report said : ‘ mr @entity8 said that he would often wake up early , at 5am , to put the electric heaters on so his wife could be warm when she got up			2
mrs @entity31 , who was 85 at the time , would sit in the kitchen with her arms on the radiator to try and get warm			0
‘ throughout the time they did not have heating , mrs @entity31 was very unwell			0
this turned out to be the symptoms of the tongue cancer that she eventually died from			0
‘ mr @entity8 was distressed when talking about his wife and the suffering she must have felt being unwell and freezing cold on top of that			2
‘ he said that one of the last things his wife said to him when she was ill in hospital before she died was to ask him if the heating had been put in yet			0
‘ he said that she must have really suffered to still be thinking about the heating at that time			0
’ the @entity38 said it was clear that @entity24 failed to carry out work to meet mr @entity8 ’s needs , and stopped working altogether within six months of being installed			1
‘ the purpose of @entity18 was to tackle fuel poverty by ensuring people without working heating systems got working heating systems , ’ the report added , arguing both @entity23 and @entity24 should have recognised that they had failed to meet this basic objective			1
mr @entity8 was persuaded to sign up to the scheme update the working heating system in the three - bedroom home the couple had lived in since 1962			1
@entity24 carried out a survey of the @entity104 ’ home in february 2009 , and a boiler was installed in july that year			2
but in january 2010 , mr @entity8 complained to @entity24 that his house was not warming up , including having problems with the water pressure and thermostat			2
some remedial work was carried out in february 2010 , but this made little difference			0
@entity19 mp @entity86 condemned the ' heartless refusal ' of the government to intervene earlier mr @entity8 made a formal complaint in may 2010 about the suitability of the boiler and the fact it had been put in a place that he was not happy with			1
they promised to carry out a ‘ power slush ’ to remove sludge and debris from the pipework and radiators in august			0
in october that year he complained to the @entity23 , and they promised a power flush in november but the firm and ministry kept blaming the properties old pipework			1
it was not until march 2012 that @entity24 finally admitted it had put the boiler 90 degrees from it should have been , and said the heating system no longer met mr @entity8 ’s needs			1
they offered to replace the boiler in the position originally agreed and fit new radiators in the lounge , but mr @entity8 considered the offer to ‘ inadequate ’ and complained to the ombudsman			2
as a result , @entity24 upped its offer and has installed a better boiler , new radiators and underground pipes and is planning to make good the kitchen and redecorate and pay £ 1,500 in compensation			1
while the firm had now gone beyond what was required under guidance , these actions were only ‘ reasonable , adequate and fair ’ given the suffering the family experienced			0
a @entity23 spokesman said : ' the customer service provided on this occasion was unacceptable and we are writing to mr @entity8 directly to express our most sincere apologies that the service he received was far from the usual high standard			1
' we have worked with @entity24 , who run @entity18 , to ensure that mr @entity8 now has a suitable heating system installed in his home which he is happy with			1
' @entity18 has helped around 2.3million vulnerable households since 2000			2
overall customer satisfaction remains high for the scheme			0
' a @entity24 spokesman said : ‘ we acknowledge and accept the findings of this report and would apologise unreservedly for what has clearly been a difficult time			0
‘ the heating system is now fully operational and we are in contact with mr @entity8 to discuss additional measures as a goodwill gesture			0
‘ @entity18 assisted more than 2.3 million households in @entity234 during its existence , helping to make their homes warmer and more affordable to heat			2
on this occasion service levels clearly fell short of the high standards set			0
