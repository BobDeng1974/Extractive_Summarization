the @entity1 charter plane , top heavy with @entity5 ’s bloated @entity4 party of around 80 underperforming personnel , will touch down first in @entity7 and then @entity8 on wednesday afternoon on their hasty retreat from @entity10			1
the pampered underachievers — both players and officials — will scuttle towards a convoy of chauffeured cars and then home to their families			0
there will be no welcoming party of @entity5 fans thankful for having been entertained by their heroes on the greatest football stage in the world			1
just a miserable retreat for a pathetic @entity5			1
this was the team of athletes , coaches , and a myriad of experts that flew from @entity5 in the belief that they would be the ‘ best prepared team at the @entity4 ’			1
what they were n’t prepared for , and neither were the fans who paid thousands of pounds to follow a dream to @entity10 , was that @entity5 would be out eight days after the tournament had begun			1
even now , the humiliation may not be over			0
@entity5 play @entity49 on tuesday night in @entity50			1
if they lose , this will be their most miserable @entity4 since 1950 when @entity5 were defeated by the @entity52 in the same city			1
at least in those days @entity5 managed one victory , a 2 - 0 win over @entity56 in @entity57			1
that tweed - and - brogue clad party numbered only 17 players , four referees , two trainers , eight sports writers and the manager			0
it was long before an @entity5 team needed an army of sports @entity68 how did it come to this ? and how did we get to the stage that the @entity1 ’s reaction is to keep calm and carry on ? the @entity1 ’s blundering chairman @entity74 ’s timing on friday was bizarre in the face of such an abject display			1
a time for review or consideration ? best to review the operations of the whole @entity5 set - up ? no , @entity74 blurted out his and the @entity1 ’s full support for @entity25 just minutes before @entity49 scored the goal against @entity83 that sealed @entity5 ’s fate			1
unnecessary : @entity74 has made a series of needless comments in his role as @entity1 chairman @entity89 : @entity5 crashed at the group stage in @entity10 but @entity74 says @entity25 will not be sacked @entity74 , who likes a report as his ill - conceived @entity92 shows , should have , at the very least , played a straight bat when asked about @entity25 ’s future			1
then he should have set about a root - and - branch review of @entity5 ’s approach to this @entity4			1
the starting point ? what exactly did everyone in that ridiculously excessive @entity1 party — only @entity101 had a bigger delegation — do to justify their place in @entity10 ? not a lot in many cases			1
@entity107 , @entity5 ’s retiring director of football development who somehow thinks @entity5 can win the @entity4 in 2018 , made a short address in a ceremony in a @entity113 cathedral to mark the 60th anniversary of the d - day landings			1
apart from that his only noticeable contribution seems to have been endlessly walking around the training ground keeping fit			0
keep fit : sir @entity107 appeared to spend most of his time walking around the training ground @entity74 might also ask why @entity5 need a load of blazers hanging around the hotel with nothing to do but wait for the next free drink or dinner			1
the defunct dinosaur international committee , who have n’t had a meeting for three years since being marginalised by the @entity130 set - up , still had @entity131 and @entity132 in @entity113			0
then another four — @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 — took their places on the @entity1 gravy train for the @entity10 leg			1
and as if this is n’t enough freeloading largesse , @entity142 ’s @entity141 has arrived for the meaningless match against @entity49 because @entity133 went home after the @entity147 humiliation			0
@entity5 flew out with all manner of specialists : fitness and conditioning coaches , doctors , sports scientists , video analysts , security officers , four club @entity5 and @entity1 executives and numerous commercial figures			1
the whole team will fly back as what @entity159 might call ‘ specialists in failure ’			1
impact ? @entity163 talks with sports psychologist @entity164 but his contribution has been questioned perhaps the most heralded member of the team was the acclaimed sports psychiatrist @entity164			1
but he has cut a timid , detached figure , who did nothing either to empower @entity163 and his team - mates			0
one leading @entity173 coach asked : ‘ when is the last time that group of players lined up in the tunnel with a look about them that said to the opposition : “ you ’re gon na have to play well to beat us today , lads ”			0
’ the answer is probably against @entity184 , in the quarter - final of the @entity4 in @entity186			0
it was there that @entity5 played for an hour with 10 men and were beaten , inevitably , in a penalty shootout			1
@entity74 , who attended a couple of training sessions at the @entity194 military base , should also demand specific data on the impact of so many sports scientists			0
@entity5 had the best of everything — except the football			2
at their base in @entity194 , the @entity1 lavished over £ 100,000 on ensuring the training pitch was up to standard yet used it on just seven occasions ; likewise the media centre , which cost £ 80,000 , partly paid by sponsors @entity206 , to install			1
firing line : @entity208 and @entity209 fronted up to the early exit at the expensively - assembled media centre this extravagance was also in evidence during the squad ’s three weeks of training before they arrived in @entity57			0
the @entity1 spent more than £ 100million building a national training centre at @entity218 outside @entity219 , yet had less than three full days there during that time			1
instead they preferred to go to the @entity220 — colder than @entity219 for part of the week — and then on to @entity113 at the start of the hurricane season with the first day ’s training washed out by rain			0
and only the @entity1 in their wisdom could complete their @entity4 from hell by having a closed training session on sunday when already out of competition			2
how much better it would have been to let in fans , who have been totally let down by @entity5 , to watch them practise			2
it was ‘ business as usual on a match day minus two , ’ said an @entity1 spokesman			2
try telling that to the short - changed @entity5 supporter			2
the @entity1 have a habit of putting a positive spin on everything			2
why even this @entity4 has been a success : due to @entity242 appearance money for @entity4 finalists they will make a net profit from their brief stay in @entity10			2
nowhere was the @entity1 ’s financial obsession better illustrated than when the team was used as clothes horses for kit suppliers @entity252 ’s vast wardrobe of gear			1
the smiles of the @entity1 officials and staff at @entity5 ’s military training base on sunday said it all			1
soon enough they will pack up their boxes of @entity252 t - shirts , shorts and socks and travel home with the rest of the team			0
@entity267 setting : the @entity1 paid £ 100,000 for one training pitch but it was barely used this has been an appalling @entity4 campaign and yet the public are supposed to accept the same , dreadful excuses from the @entity1			1
to the outsider , no one is really taking this shameful experience seriously enough within that organisation			0
when @entity101 , @entity280 and @entity281 have found themselves in similar positions , they have opted for a cathartic overhaul			0
at their training camp , you are met by armed , @entity10 military personnel on the way in			2
once inside , there is a cossetted , almost arrogant , atmosphere			0
we are @entity5 , it says			2
@entity25 is a lovely , charming man			0
but he has proved beyond reasonable doubt he can not lead @entity5 to success at tournament football			2
the facts speak for themselves			0
‘ the players gave me everything i could have asked for and more , ’ @entity25 claimed and that proves the point			0
if they really have given him everything and more , and still lost their opening two group games , there is something profoundly wrong			0
every time @entity5 come up against elite competition , they get well beaten			2
time.that the jobs of @entity25 and his assistants are safe after such a fiasco – even before the last dead rubber of is played — is beyond belief			0
however , it is worth casting the mind back to @entity5 ’s @entity318 surrender in @entity319 last winter			2
@entity321 chairman @entity320 was adamant that @entity322 would remain in charge			0
and flower , like @entity25 insisted , could n’t see any reason why he should n’t			0
a month later @entity322 , once out of the @entity5 bubble of a major sporting event , realised the depth of national feeling and resigned			0
he admitted that those who had questioned him had been right all along			0
@entity25 should do the same , but he wo n’t .			0

around 80 @entity5 staff will return to the @entity32 on wednesday
that includes an army of specialists who had no impact on the team
£ 100,000 was spent on a pitch they hardly used in @entity10
arrogant @entity1 blazers *swanned* around the team hotel
@entity1 have offered same excuses for humiliation as they did at previous finals
