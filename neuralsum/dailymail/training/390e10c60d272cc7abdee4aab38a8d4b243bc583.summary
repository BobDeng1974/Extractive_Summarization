historical evidence of how plucky @entity2 army officers rescued @entity6 ’s original ‘ @entity5 ’ and transformed it into the legendary @entity4 goes under the hammer next week			1
the blueprint beetle plans and associated papers reveal how the @entity2 team who re-started production at the factory in 1945 led directory to the re-birth of what is now @entity18 ’s biggest car company and to the revival of the booming @entity21 car industry			1
the blueprints carry on them the name of one of the key figures - colonel @entity27 – and will go to auction at the @entity30 motor cars and automobilia sale at @entity32 , @entity33 on monday			1
instructions : scale drawings clearly show the outline of the famous type 1 beetle and explain how to build one hand - over : colonel @entity27 signs over the ' saved ' @entity5 factory in @entity41 to the @entity21 in 1949 the documents were discovered originally by the @entity2 army officers in 1945 in the ruins of the @entity5 factory in @entity46 that had switched from pre-war car production to wartime military vehicles and even parts for the infamous v1 rockets or ‘ @entity52 ’ which rained down on @entity51			1
the @entity2 officers and their team brought back to life what @entity6 called his ‘ @entity57 ’ ( @entity58 ’ ) – or ‘ @entity57 ’ – car in a town which carried the same name			0
but they gave it back its original name – @entity5 or ‘ @entity5 ‘ – and renamed the town @entity41 after the local castle			1
after defusing an @entity67 bomb that had been dropped on the car plant in @entity41 , colonel @entity27 and major @entity69 found the blueprints for @entity6 's pre-war ' @entity71			0
' from them , they restarted car production of the car designed for @entity6 by dr @entity77 – who founded the @entity80 car dynasty - with an order for 20,000 type 1 beetles for the @entity2 army and in doing so helped get @entity46 working again after the war			1
since then 21 million @entity85 have produced and its success was one of the major building blocks of today ’s mighty @entity21 motor industry			1
one careful owner : colonel @entity27 's personal @entity5 how - to - guide : blueprints were made into two books each containing 18 tabbed sections which will be auctioned by @entity30 on december 3 it comes as @entity5 this week launches a new generation version of the @entity97 at the @entity98 in the @entity99			1
the blueprints are believed to be copies as the originals were destroyed by @entity67 bombing during the war			0
they were made into two folios each containing 18 tabbed sections and were used by @entity108			0
they are now being sold at auction in @entity33 with a guide price of £ 3,000 to £ 4,000 pounds			2
the scale drawings clearly show the outline of the famous car and tell the reader how to build a beetle			0
various sections include the drawings for major components of the @entity4 car , including the engine , fuel pump , carburettor , gear box , steering gear and body			2
the @entity2 beetle adventure had begun when @entity128 , who was looking for a workshop that could carry out repairs to @entity67 tanks and transport , sent @entity133 of the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) to check out the stricken factory and ‘ take charge			0
’ amongst the debris the @entity2 found some @entity139 parts			0
@entity69 decided to make the car in the factory and use it as much - needed transport for the occupying allies			0
he had the car painted army green and sent it to his commanding officers			0
shortly afterwards he received an order for 20,000 more cars			2
big order : @entity2 @entity152 order for 20,000 beetles in 1945			1
raw materials were , however , in short supply due to the war and by 1946 the @entity2 army had produced 1,000 @entity5 out with the old , in with the new : the new @entity4 on display at @entity159			1
but is it as popular ? they even lashed up a one - off cabriolet version which they dubbed the ‘ @entity166 ’ in honour of the colonel			0
and by march 1946 the @entity2 army had produced its 1,000th @entity5			2
in may , 1949 , the ‘ @entity168 ’ was formed and five months later the factory was officially handed back to the @entity21			1
a road close to the @entity5 factory is now named after @entity133 in appreciation of the work he did to save the @entity5 factory			1
the blueprints are being offered for sale by a private collector from the @entity2			0
a @entity30 spokesman said : ‘ colonel @entity27 , along with major @entity69 and colonel @entity180 were deployed by the @entity181 to commandeer and oversee operations at the @entity58 factory in @entity184 after the end of @entity186 according to information supplied by the vendor they discovered these copies of blueprints for the car , the originals believed to have been destroyed by @entity67 bombing of the factory , and @entity69 , @entity196 and @entity180 each owned one set of the blueprint copies , @entity27 's set being offered here along with another unnamed set			1
‘ he added : ‘ @entity133 is credited by motor historians and enthusiasts as being instrumental in reviving the @entity204 production of the car that become known as the ' @entity139 ' , which may never have happened if it was n't for the discovery of these blueprints			2
’ @entity208 , head of the automobilia department at @entity30 , said : ‘ @entity2 influence on the industry in @entity46 immediately after the way can not be underestimated			0
‘ the beetle is iconic			0
like the @entity214 it came through the age of austerity and came out the other side still going strong			0
‘ these blueprints are a reminder of the huge @entity2 influence in making the @entity21 motor industry the might that it is today			2
