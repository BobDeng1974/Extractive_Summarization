by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 17 june 2013 a £ 1.5billion rescue plan for the @entity3 will slash the income of thousands of pensioners , it emerged yesterday			1
the 169 - year - old bank will be floated on the stock market to plug a giant hole in its balance sheet			1
it hopes to raise £ 1billion in a mix of shares and bonds , plus a further £ 500million by selling its general insurance arm			1
not co-operating : the @entity3 's plan to tackle their £ 1.5billion losses may see thousands of @entity18 lose out on their life savings but the @entity20 , which has 4.7million customers and whose interests run from funerals to pet insurance , wants savers who own its bonds to help foot the bill			1
up to 7,000 who handed over a chunk of their life savings will lose out			1
as part of its grand plan , the co-op will no longer pay income to its bondholders , most of whom are retired			2
some were being paid as much as 13 per cent in annual interest – or £ 1,300 for a £ 10,000 investment			1
instead , in exchange for their bonds , investors will be offered either a cash payoff , shares in the new bank , or new bonds			2
but they face losing 35p for each £ 1 of co-op bonds they hold			2
future : chief executive @entity50 is hoping for financial success when co-op bank goes on the stock market the price of many bonds has halved over the past couple of months , leaving thousands out of pocket			1
@entity58 worth £ 60million are held by individual investors , paying annual interest of 5.5 to 13 per cent			1
these bonds are a type of investment , and not to be confused with the fixed - rate savings - account bonds offered in branches			2
known as retail bonds , they are simply an iou written to investors to raise funds for business growth			2
in return for money , the lender pays savers interest			0
@entity75 , of financial adviser @entity76 , said : ‘ many people will have considered these co-op bonds to be safe , but this highlights just how much of a huge risk there can be when investing			0
i fear there will be more pain as they ’ll be forced to accept further losses as part of the rescue plans			2
’ the bailout follows months of setbacks for the @entity90 op. in march , it revealed a £ 600million loss as a result of having to pay compensation for the mis - sale of payment protection insurance , and losses on bad loans			1
the following month , it pulled out of a bid for 632 @entity102 branches			0
then in may , a downgrade from the ratings agency @entity104 saw the bank ’s debt being given ‘ junk ’ status			2
the @entity109 also revealed it had put a halt to new lending to small firms			0
analysis by @entity114 , city editor the implosion at the @entity3 that will wipe out the savings of thousands of smaller investors and trusts is the result of hubris and mismanagement on a mammoth scale			1
instead of the ultimate owners of the bank – the wealthy co-operative movement – digging into its own coffers , it is the bondholders who are being asked to carry the can			0
it is the closest @entity18 has come to a @entity132 - style rescue in which ordinary investors are made to pay for errors of management and government			0
the crisis at the so - called ethical bank is the result of political interference in decision - making and inadequate banking disciplines			0
this has left a £ 1.5billion black hole in the bank ’s balance sheet , placed the whole co-operative movement at risk and created huge uncertainty for the bank ’s 4.7million customers			1
successive governments have contributed to the crisis			0
it was @entity155 ’s administration that sought to back a new ‘ super-mutual ’ bank as a challenger on the high street			0
the @entity160 ’s favourite bank , the co-operative , was chosen as its preferred vehicle and the government backed a 2009 merger with the much larger @entity165			0
trust gone : the implosion at the @entity3 is the result of ' hubris and mismanagement on a mammoth scale ' dozens of @entity173 , including shadow chancellor @entity174 , are sponsored by the co-op movement			1
the @entity165 deal turned out to be a disaster			0
large numbers of mortgages on the @entity165 ’s books were rotten and the society had become embroiled in commercial property deals that went wrong in the recession			0
much of this was hidden from public view until @entity186 gave the nod to the @entity3 bid for 632 @entity102 branches			1
the former @entity190 should have stepped in and made it clear that the co-op lacked the management and balance sheet resources to enter the big league			0
not surprisingly the deal fell apart when the co-op revealed heavy property losses and acknowledged it lacked the systems to manage the bank			1
it was then that credit ratings agency @entity104 downgraded the bank ’s debt to ‘ junk ’ status			0
that meant traditional customers , such as local authorities and non-governmental organisations , could no longer safely hold deposits with the bank			1
under the complex rescue package just unveiled by the co-op after extensive talks with the @entity217 ’s @entity216 watchdog , it is bondholders rather than the co-op movement who will bear most of the pain			0
that has left investors in the bonds angry , disappointed and disillusioned with both the co-op and the government that allowed this series of catastrophic errors to happen .			0

bank needs to raise £ 1.5billion to combat annual losses
