@entity1 's manifesto pledge to dramatically extend @entity3 's right - to - buy policy was this morning attacked as a ' deeply unfair ' bribe which will cost taxpayers billions of pounds			1
in a bold pitch to working class voters , the prime minister said the @entity9 would offer discounts of up to 70 per cent to 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home			1
but the @entity14 said the subsidy - which will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties - will cost taxpayers £ 5.8billion and was effectively worth £ 100,000 to each family who benefited			1
@entity34 jumped on the remarks this morning , claiming the policy had ' unravelled ' and pointed to figures showing that last year just 479 council homes were sold off – raising £ 100million , or 2 per cent of the funds promised by the @entity9			1
but the home secretary @entity40 defended the policy on the @entity42 this morning – insisting it was affordable and would give families the opportunity to live in a home that they owned			2
she said : ' it is a very important policy because it shows what sort of government a @entity49 government would be			0
it shows that we 're a government that 's on the side of working people who want to get on a build a better future for themselves and their families			0
' unveiling the conservative manifesto this morning , mr @entity1 declared the ' dream of a property - owning democracy is alive '			2
he said : ' the next @entity49 government will extend the right - to - buy to all housing association tenants in this country – 1.3million extra families – a new generation given the security of a home of their own			1
' original plan : the right - to - buy scheme became @entity3 's most famous single policy the pledge to extend right - to - buy , which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by @entity34 in @entity77 and the @entity78 in @entity79 , will delight the @entity49 faithful , who were buoyed last night by a six - point poll lead over @entity34			1
but the policy was branded ' deeply unfair ' by housing associations and industry experts today			0
@entity14 director @entity85 said the extension of @entity87 to buy to housing association properties was ' the wrong solution to our housing crisis '			1
she said : ' a very conservative estimate of this policy puts the cost to the taxpayer of at least £ 5.8billion			2
' following 40 years of successive governments ' failure to build the homes the country needs , soaring rents and house prices and the biggest baby boom since the 1950s , ensuring that there enough homes today and tomorrow must be our nation 's top priority			0
' she added : ' halfway through a programme of austerity and in the grips of a housing crisis , if you had £ 20 billion of taxpayers ' money , would you just give it away as a gift to some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents ? ' @entity122 , deputy chief executive of the @entity26 , said the move would do nothing to tackle the housing crisis			2
he said : ' in fact it could make things worse for people on lower incomes who are already struggling to access a decent home at a price they can afford			0
' individual tenants might benefit from the opportunity to own a home , but we would be very concerned that it would result in a dramatic loss of vital social and affordable housing			2
' the conservatives say that forcing councils to sell off their most valuable properties would fund this extension plus 400,000 new homes over five years – we fear the figures simply wo n't stack up			1
' @entity146 and chancellor of the exchequer @entity145 listen to prime minister @entity1 as he unveils the @entity49 manifesto in @entity148 this morning he added : ' and it could have a huge impact on councils ' ability to build new homes , particularly in more expensive areas like @entity155 and the south east , where it might actually make more sense for them to borrow against the value of these properties so they can fund more homes			2
' senior @entity49 figures , including @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , have been calling for the measure to be at the heart of the party 's manifesto			0
the original right - to - buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates			1
leading to a surge in home ownership , it became @entity3 's most famous single policy			0
@entity34 's shadow housing minister attacked the @entity49 policy today the @entity181 government has already increased right - to - buy discounts for council homes , meaning more are moving into the private sector			1
but most tenants living in homes provided by housing associations – not - for - profit bodies that have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing – do not qualify			1
enabling them to buy their homes is expected to require major changes to the @entity195 , and is likely to be fiercely opposed by housing associations themselves			2
as well as promoting home ownership , the scheme could also dramatically reduce the vast housing benefit bill			0
currently , taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties			1
the 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people			1
mr @entity1 said : ' at the heart of this manifesto is a simple proposition			0
we are the party of working people , offering you security at every stage of your life			0
' if you 're a young person looking for training , if you 're looking for a decent job , if you want to buy your own home , if you 're raising a family and need help with childcare , if you fall ill , and need to rely on our @entity221 , if you are reaching retirement , and want real security			2
we are there for you – offering security at every stage of your life			0
' some @entity34 figures , including former welfare minister @entity228 and former cabinet minister @entity229 , have previously championed the idea of extending the right - to - buy to housing associations			1
how does right - to - buy work ? introduced in 1980 , it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home			1
@entity34 dropped its opposition to the policy but , in 1999 , @entity239 's government cut the top discount from £ 50,000 to £ 38,000 and sales slowed			0
what has the coalition done ? it has sought to reinvigorate the scheme , cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of £ 77,000 for most areas			1
are housing association tenants covered ? housing associations – autonomous , not - for - profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low - cost homes – are largely exempt			1
however , around 800,000 ha tenants have a limited ' right to acquire ' with discounts capped at between £ 9,000 to £ 16,000			2
the other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy			0
what are the @entity49 proposals ? they would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right - to - buy			1
tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount , increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant			0
those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount , going up 2 per cent every year			0
discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or £ 102,700 in @entity155 and £ 77,000 across the rest of @entity278			2
how will this be paid for ? the @entity9 say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant			1
council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off			0
around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year , because tenants die or move			0
the sell - off could net £ 4.5billion a year			0
what about the proceeds ? they will be split , with a proportion used to replace on a ' one - to - one ' basis the council homes sold off			0
the new properties would be more affordable , probably in less expensive locations , and could be built either by a council or housing association			2
another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right - to - buy discounts for housing association tenants			1
the rest would go to create a £ 1billion fund , enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing			0
it would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land , and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years , @entity9 say .			0
