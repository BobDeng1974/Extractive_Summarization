by @entity0 ‘ this book is a manifesto , ’ writes professor @entity1 , who is n’t messing around			1
there is an idea abroad which , though counter-intuitive , has taken the fusty world of linguistics by storm			2
the only problem , says @entity1 , is that it ’s wrong			2
the @entity11 says that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world			1
so the @entity18 look at everything in their very @entity18 way — with an effortless sneer and possibly a cigarette hanging from their lips — not because they are @entity18 , but because they speak @entity18			1
feeling @entity18 : the @entity11 says that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world this idea caught on in academic circles in the @entity33 , when a fire inspector and part - time linguist called @entity36 observed that the @entity38 language @entity39 has no way of marking time			1
there are no tenses , no words like ‘ later ’ , and @entity36 theorised that these informed the @entity45 ’ sense of how time and the world work			2
in @entity39 , he said , past , present and future are the same , and this corresponded to ‘ the cyclical sense of time in @entity39 cosmology ’			2
the academic world being what it is , @entity11 was succeeded by @entity54 , whose adherents continue to gather evidence to support the hypothesis			1
in @entity60 , there are words for ‘ dark blue ’ and ‘ light blue ’ , but no word for just ‘ blue ’ , while in @entity66 only one word covers ‘ blue ’ and ‘ green ’			0
does that mean @entity60 and the @entity66 see colours differently ? @entity68 would say they do , and have tried to prove it			0
@entity1 thinks it ’s all hogwash			1
@entity39 , he says , marks time as much as anyone would expect a language to , ‘ with good old - fashioned tense markers and plenty of words for things like already and afterwards ’			1
and while @entity60 did press buttons slightly faster than @entity80 speakers when asked to distinguish between different shades of blue , it was only 124 milliseconds faster			0
the theory , he says , simply does n’t pan out			1
the problem is that the @entity86 media , not to mention a gullible public , really want it to work			0
‘ the language - as - thought idea vibrates in tune with impulses deeply felt in the modern enlightened @entity86 soul			1
’ but languages do n’t evolve in any controlled or rational way			0
the @entity95 and @entity96 are trying to impose pattern on something that has no pattern			0
@entity1 ’s conclusion is almost painfully straightforward : that all humans essentially think alike			0
i find this strangely reassuring			0
readers of @entity105 and the @entity107 books will know that it ’s much easier to put forward a pleasing new theory than it is to prove it does n’t work			2
@entity1 does n’t care about this , and takes to his subject with a giant scythe			0
the elegance of his writing and the righteousness of his rage make this an unusually sprightly ride through the thickets of academia , where people will still be arguing about this long after we are all dead .			0

@entity11 theory says the language we speak shapes our *perception*
therefore the @entity18 look at things in a @entity18 way - not because they are @entity18 , but because they speak the language
new book says the hypothesis is ' hogwash '
