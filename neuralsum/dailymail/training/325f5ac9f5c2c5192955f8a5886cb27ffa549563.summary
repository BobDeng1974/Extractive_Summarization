’ mrs may ’s call last year for a law to allow the collection of vast amounts of information about emails , phone calls and internet activities was blocked by deputy prime minister @entity59			2

she dismissed accusations that the government was engaged in mass surveillance , as claimed by supporters of rogue @entity70 spy @entity69			2
in fact , far from having a ‘ fictitious mastery ’ of the technology , @entity26 faced the ‘ significant risk of being caught out by it ’			1

‘ we continue to face possible attacks by @entity87 in @entity88 and @entity89			0
