a tumour growing inside of @entity1 caused a headache so severe that it drove her to stab herself in the head with a knife to try and relieve the pain			1
what is even more shocking is that surgeons found hair and teeth inside her tumour when they removed it from her right ovary			1
@entity1 's ordeal started three days before @entity15 when she went to work with a blistering headache			1
@entity1 , from @entity17 in @entity18 , was struck down with a headache just before @entity15 a tumour found in ovary caused her to stab herself in the head and go into a psychosis			1
@entity1 's ( left ) sister , @entity24 ( right ) , had to watch her sister go through the ordeal as the day wore on and the pain did not go away , @entity1 , from @entity17 in @entity18 , texted her sister - @entity24 - who told her to go to the sick bay			1
when @entity24 , 27 , visited her later in the day , she became concerned when @entity1 complained there was ' something in my head ' and she needed to get it out			1
the 27 - year - old told that 's life ! @entity1 's forehead did look swollen so she took her to hospital , where doctors did some tests and found nothing wrong with her			1
they sent the sisters back home with painkillers for @entity1 - who is a mine truck driver - to take			2
but her condition did not improve			0
the 28 - year - old spent the next two days in an agitated state , with her boyfriend - @entity50 - reporting she could not sleep			0
on christmas day , @entity24 told @entity51 her father had left messages to say her sister had been re-admitted to hospital			2
it took specialists weeks to diagnose @entity1 's condition , which caused her to experience mood swings @entity1 before the tumour took over her body and drove her to take up a knife and stab herself in the head to relieve the pressure of her headache frantically , she rushed to be at her sister 's bedside but nothing prepared her for what she would see when she walked into @entity1 's room			1
' she had blood on top of her head , she was strapped to the bed and rocking back forth while they were trying to do the lumbar puncture , ' @entity24 said			0
the condition mostly affects young women who end up in being misdiagnosed and are admitted into psychiatric care or display behaviour so erratic they are kept in intensive care , according to the @entity82			0
the tumour found on the ovary is named a teratoma , which could possibly have teeth , hair or brain tissue			1
this tricks the body 's immune system into attacking the brain			1
her father told @entity24 that @entity1 had tried to stab herself in the head with a knife			1
' she was so distraught about the pressure on her head that she had tried sucking it out with a vacuum prior to doing it with a knife , ' @entity24 told @entity51			2
the situation had escalated so much that the police had to be called to calm @entity1 down before she was taken to hospital			2
when the tests from the lumbar puncture came back , doctors diagnosed her with encephalitis			0
encephalitis happens when the brain becomes swollen and inflamed from a virus			0
but after days of treatment it was clear @entity1 was not responding , falling into a psychosis where she did eat or sleep			2
surgeons found an 8cm tumour on @entity1 's right ovary , which had hair and teeth inside it @entity1 and partner @entity50 who stayed with her throughout the ordeal in hospital one time @entity24 fed her sister water and she spat it out at her			1
@entity1 would also throw abuse at her loved ones and hospital staff			1
things got so bad that @entity1 was transferred to the psychiatric ward at @entity131 's @entity130 where she could be supervised by a nurse 24 hours a day			2
her behaviour became increasingly worse , to the point where she was yelling and being aggressive towards @entity24 and staff , but in the next moment she was staring into space			2
before her illness , @entity24 described her sister as ' very outgoing '			0
' she was always the one to have a comeback			0
she was very cheeky , ' @entity24 told @entity51			0
' [ she ] was a completely different [ person ] , it was n't her at all			0
' for weeks , @entity1 's condition had specialists puzzled but finally they got their answer			1
after performing an ultrasound on her abdomen , doctors found a benign tumour on her right ovary containing brain matter , which was causing the immune system to attack her brain			1
one nurse likened it to ' a monster growing inside ' of @entity1			2
her condition , ovarian teratoma encephalitis , is believed to only affect one in seven people			0
surgeons removed the 8cm tumour on her ovary , but there was another surprise inside it - hair and teeth			1
but it was a long road to recovery for the truck driver who spent another two months in hospital and went through a brain - injury rehabilitation clinic			0
@entity1 told @entity51 she had no memory of the weeks she was affected by her tumour			2
' i do n't remember anything from first week of hospital to nearly the february after that , ' she said			0
' i do n’t remember waking up until mid-february			0
that was when i was able to think on my own			0
' despite the months that have passed , @entity24 thinks her sister is still not back to the @entity1 she knew			1
' she 's not @entity1 she was prior to getting sick			0
she 's not 100 per cent i do n't think			0
