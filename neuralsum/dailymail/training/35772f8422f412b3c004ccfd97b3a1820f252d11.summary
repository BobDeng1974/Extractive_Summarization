by @entity0 @entity1 , 23 , was working on a country house redevelopment when he was crushed by a two - ton block of limestone a builder who died while working on a country house redevelopment was crushed to death by a two - ton block of limestone which fell on him because of a ' complete lack of planning ' , a jury heard today			1

he was airlifted to hospital with ' catastrophic injuries ' , but died later the same day @entity59 , prosecuting , said : ' the decision had been taken not to use any fixings to hold the stone in place , therefore when the strops [ a short rope whose ends are spliced together to make a ring ] on the crane were slackened off , the only thing that held it there was its own weight			2
' since it was top - heavy and its width was not uniform and it was balanced on two concrete blocks , it was inevitable it would topple			0
' he said tests were later carried out on the block and found that because of its irregular shape , it was a matter of millimetres which could decide whether it was stable or not			0
' the specialist inspectors from @entity86 considered the absence of restraint as being very serious , ' he said			0
' they identified fixing the stones in place before the strops were let off was an essential part of the operation and absence was a significant error			0
mr @entity1 had originally been working on the site as a plumber and was then taken on by @entity38 as a stonemason ’s mate because he was recognised as being a good worker sign : @entity38 is due to be sentenced at @entity102 on a forthcoming date ' it was concluded this was a result of a complete lack of planning and the work of @entity38 fell significantly below the standard expected of someone carrying out such a lifting operation			1
' it would appear no real thought or planning had gone into the operation itself			0
' @entity116 did almost nothing to ensure the lifting operation was done safely			0
the dangers it posed were obvious and they had been alerted by an email from the architect			0
' the crane and its driver , from a local plant hire base , had only been drafted in to the site that morning , @entity123 @entity102 heard			1
at the time of the incident , the masonry team was building a ' rustic wall ' above the so - called @entity132 at the home of former @entity31 director @entity30			1

mr @entity150 was directing crane driver @entity155 and mr @entity151 was on the lintel , while mr @entity1 , who had been on the stairs , moved down below the block to try to move it into place			1
mr @entity59 told the court : ' when mr @entity150 appeared happy with the position of the stone he signalled to mr @entity155 to slacken off			1
' according to mr @entity155 , only seconds after this happened the stone began to topple over onto mr @entity1			1
' the jury was told that the limestone pieces obtained by @entity38 were twice as high as the ones envisaged by architect @entity167 and had prompted the masonry firm to produce its own drawings to reflect the change			2
mr @entity59 said the move prompted mr @entity167 to send an email to @entity116 ’s director , @entity173 , which read : ' that sounds very promising			0
