@entity0 have joined @entity1 and @entity2 in asking for @entity4 's @entity3 on loan			1
if successful it would mean they would have to make any deal for @entity9 a permanent one as they ca n't have two players on loan from the same @entity13 club			1
22 - year - old @entity3 is wanted by a raft of clubs in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 for a year - long loan deal after spending last season at @entity21 in @entity22			2
@entity3 enjoyed a successful loan spell in @entity22 , scoring five goals in 28 appearances - but has ruled out a return to the @entity48 this time round			0
@entity4 are holding further talks with @entity50 over a one year player - coach contract			1
the 36 - year - old is expected to make his return to @entity54 later this week			0
misfit : the @entity57 striker has failed to make an impression at his parent club since joining in 2011 lethal : the striker netted 15 times in the league for the @entity0 last year , and was their top scorer			0
youngster : @entity64 is hoping he can convince the player @entity2 once tried to sign to come to @entity66			0

@entity2 and @entity1 are already in the *market* for the wide man
@entity0 could not take two @entity4 players on loan
that means if this deal goes through it would rule out a @entity9 loan
@entity50 *continues* talks over player - coach role at @entity4
