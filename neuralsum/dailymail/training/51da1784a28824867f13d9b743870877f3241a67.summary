by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 05:32 est , 5 december 2012 retail therapy can cure many an ailment , and though the @entity4 are multi-billionaires , they apparently find their source of comfort in the filled aisles of @entity9			2
the former @entity11 presidential candidate and his wife were pictured shopping at their local bulk warehouse near their home in @entity17 , @entity18 on tuesday			1
the couple stocked up on bottled water , pretzels , fruit snacks , dixie cups and paper towels			2
they also seemed to be preparing for @entity26 as their carts had a few rolls of gift wrap and a toy car that will likely be a present for one of their 18 grandchildren			0
the @entity60 's fondness for the discount membership club is no secret , as they frequently talked about their trips to @entity9 during the campaign trail			1
cynical political analysts cried foul , saying that the they were trying to use their mentions of the budget store as a way to help lessen the public perception that the former governor was out of touch with the ' common man ' because of his great wealth			0
the family 's affinity for the store seems genuine , however , as @entity37 repeatedly boasted that it was the easiest - and most fiscally responsible - way to feed her large family			0
blending in : @entity36 and @entity37 were both dressed down , though @entity37 accessorized her look with a hot pink scarf no driver needed : the couple arrived in their own @entity83 suv what do we need ? they both sported sunglasses during the visit , though @entity36 decided to keep his on the entire time and @entity37 took them off while inside the store plan of attack : @entity37 has previously said that she always thinks about what is the most strategic way to shop in the store before going inside because it can be overwhelming when the couple 's five sons , their wives and all of their children come over for dinner , the total number of @entity4 at the various dinner tables can easily add up to 30 people			1
during an interview on the @entity105 show during the campaign , @entity37 told the celebrity chef how she always has her route mapped out before she goes in the store			0
' wholesale shops are big , you have to go with a game plan before you start , ' she said at the time			0
@entity113 at work : @entity60 bought several children 's toys during his visit , presumably for some of his 18 grandchildren spoiler alert : one of the @entity60 clan can expect a remote controlled car for @entity26 trying to go unnoticed : @entity36 kept to himself during the visit , but in spite of his hopes , the hat and glasses did not keep alert shoppers from noticing him during that appearance , @entity37 talked a great deal about how she buys the store 's produce - both fresh and frozen - and stocks up on desserts			1
but the pictures from their tuesday trip to the @entity18 store reveal that she and @entity36 focused more on the non-perishables this time			0
it looks like in addition to picking up some @entity26 presents for the kids , the couple may have also gotten a puffy black jacket for @entity36 , as one was seen hanging off the side of his cart			0
he tried to blend in during the trip , and was dressed casually in khaki shorts , a navy athletic shirt a baseball cap and sneakers , but his black sunglasses inside the store may have been a bit conspicuous			0
@entity37 seemed relaxed but made less of an effort to blend in with the masses as she accessorized her black leisurewear with a hot pink scarf			0
new attire : @entity36 appears to have bought a puffy black winter jacket even though the @entity18 temperatures do no require one quite yet casual gear : @entity60 has not announced many plans for his life post-campaign , though he did just rejoin the board of directors of @entity165 about their business : the couple have led a low - key life since the election ended in november clean up : aside from one ' exit interview ' , @entity60 has kept quiet as many commentators speculated on the demise of his presidential bid healthy : @entity178 juice drinks and @entity179 were among the treats that they bought doing his part : @entity36 returns the carts after he and @entity37 emptied their loot the former presidential candidate has laid low ever since he lost the election , relaxing with his family in @entity17 , taking time out to see the latest edition of the @entity190 and accompanying his grandchildren to @entity192			1
@entity60 briefly popped back up on the political radar when he had lunch with president @entity195 in the @entity196 last week , though he did not speak to reporters after the meeting and only one joint photo was released			1
as of monday , @entity36 officially has an income again , since he announced yesterday that he will be re-joining the board of directors of the hotel chain , @entity202			1
board members receive an annual salary of $ 60,000 as well as $ 110,000 in company stock as compensation for their efforts			2
@entity36 served on the board of the company from 1993 to 2002 when he resigned to serve as governor of @entity211			2
he re-joined the board in 2009 and resigned again in january 2011 as the campaign heated up with the seemingly - unending process of @entity11 primaries			1

@entity219 have long been fans of the discount bulk shop
comes day after @entity60 re-joined the board of directors of @entity202
