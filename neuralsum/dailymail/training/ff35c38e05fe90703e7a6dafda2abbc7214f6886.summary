if anyone questioned @entity3 's deadline day capture of @entity4 then have a word with @entity6			1
it was the deftest of touches midway through the first half , but it had @entity6 - a seasoned international defender - bewildered , looking round for the ball			2
one second @entity6 was comfortable , goal side and touch tight with @entity14			2
but with an inconspicuous flick of his boot , the @entity15 was arrowing into @entity20 's penalty area			1
@entity4 made his first start fro @entity22 in the 1 - 0 win against @entity20 on wednesday night the @entity15 international lived up to his billing after his £ 27million move from @entity27 on deadline day it was a breathtaking moment of skill			1
the sort of thing that forced @entity3 to pay an initial £ 23.3million rising to £ 27m			2
and on this , his first start for the @entity34 , @entity14 , for the most part , lived up to his billing			1
his ovation ahead of kick - off would have made the @entity40 feel at ease in his new home			2
and had he been as vocal as those who now chant his name , @entity14 may well have earned his new team an early penalty after his shot ricocheted onto @entity49 's arm			0
it looked a blatant spot kick on the replays , and perhaps with a louder appeal , referee @entity50 would have pointed to the spot			2
@entity3 will surely drum that into @entity14 in the coming weeks - but on wednesday night 's evidence the @entity15 does n't need a lengthy induction into life at @entity22			1
@entity4 , who could have had a goal and an assist inside 25 minutes , strikes at goal manager @entity3 will have been pleased with his new signing 's work rate too he slotted seamlessly into @entity22 's attacking quartet - getting to grips with the fluidity of @entity3 's forward line instantly			1
he started the game out on the right , but looked just as comfortable through the middle or on the left			1
@entity3 likes a versatile player , in @entity14 he seems to have one			0
he could easily have scored a goal and assisted another inside the opening 25 minutes such was his impact in the early stages			0
his work rate caught the eye , too			0
refusing to allow @entity80 to bear the brunt of the defensive duties down @entity22 's right , @entity14 ensured he was on hand to lend support to his team - mate as they dealt with @entity88 's threat			1
@entity89 won the game for the @entity92 leaders in the closing stages with a long range strike @entity89 takes a moment to look to the heavens after sealing a precious victory in @entity22 's title charge @entity3 would n't accept anything less , though			1
there was n't quite the same level of dynamism in @entity14 's second half display			0
perhaps the pace of the @entity92 caught up with him			0
he saw little of the ball in the second period before he was replace by @entity110 in the 69th minute			0
but the facts spoke for themselves : a respectable 87.2 percent pass completion rate , two shots , three key passes and 62 touches of the football			0
perhaps this display did n't have the razzmatazz of his performances for @entity121 during the @entity122			0
but he showed more than enough to leave @entity22 supporters with a positive first impression			1
work - rate , versatility , pace and end product - @entity14 is your archetypal @entity3 player .			0

@entity4 made first start for @entity22 against @entity20 on wednesday
@entity135 *joined* @entity22 on *transfer* deadline day for £ 27million
former @entity27 man @entity4 , for the most part , lived up to his billing
@entity15 started on the right but looked equally capable in centre and left
