by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:15 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 19:14 est , 19 october 2013 two murderers who escaped from prison by using forged release documents have been caught after spending nearly a month on the run			1
@entity8 and @entity9 were taken back into custody on saturday night after being found in a @entity12 motel			1
@entity14 police said the men , who were both serving life sentences , were arrested without incident , but it has not been said what led police to the @entity20			1
days later , @entity9 , also 34 , used the same paperwork to get his sentence ' reduced ' to time served , as well			2
he was released on october 8			0
the men were so convinced that their scheme had worked , they showed up at another correction facility to register as ex-cons that had been released into the community			2
family members and friends of two convicted killers initially thought their release was legitimate and spent time with them , even planning a birthday party for one			0
but in the weeks after their release , relatives learned that the men were freed because of forged documents that reduced their life sentences to 15 years			1
caught : both convicts were arrested at the @entity56 in @entity12 on saturday evening @entity57 , who was described as @entity8 ' father figure , said he brought the convict clothes when he picked him up from prison , and drove him to see his mother and grandmother			1
mr @entity57 planned a birthday party at his home for @entity8 , who turned 34 on october 1 , a few days later , but he never showed up			2
at a news conference on saturday , family members of both men pleaded with them to turn themselves in			0
we just want you to surrender yourself to someone you trust who will bring you back here safely			0
we do n't want any harm to come to you , ' @entity9 's mother , @entity74 said			0
ms @entity74 said the family thought their prayers had been answered when she got the call saying @entity9 would be released october 8			2
she was so shocked and delighted that she called the prison back twice to make sure it was true , and was told the same information each time , an attorney for the family said			0
appeal : @entity9 's mother , @entity74 , her husband @entity86 , listen as @entity8 ' uncle , @entity57 , calls for the men to turn themselves in manhunt : the families of the two escaped convicts made an emotional appeal to them a few hours before @entity8 and @entity9 were caught @entity9 was taken by prison staff to a bus station so he could travel home , and the convict even attended church during his pseudo release			1
his mother said the family have been cooperating with authorities and made no attempts to hide him			0
just like @entity8 , @entity9 registered as a felon at the jail three days after he was released			1
both men signed paperwork , were fingerprinted and even photographed before walking out of the jail without raising any alarms			0
by registering , the men drew less attention to their forged release			2
had one of the murder victim 's families not contacted prosecutors , authorities might not have known about the mistaken releases			0
@entity121 - @entity120 state attorney @entity119 told the @entity122 he found out about @entity8 ' escape after his victim 's family told prosecutors that he had been released			1
that led to the discovery that @entity9 also was out of prison			2
emotional : @entity74 says she called the prison twice after being told her son was due to be released early ' we 're looking at the system 's breakdown , i 'm not standing here to point the finger at anyone at this time , ' @entity121 sheriff @entity130 said on friday			1
the @entity138 has since changed the way it verifies early releases and state legislators promised to hold investigative hearings			0
chief judge @entity143 , who presided over the @entity145 trial , believes that the two inmates had outside help in forging the documents			1
judge @entity143 told the @entity122 : ' i strongly believe they had some help			1
it is unlikely [ the documents ] were produced by the inmates			0
' however he has few leads on who might have falsified the documents and it is unclear how they were filed			0
judge @entity143 , who presided over the @entity145 trial , had his signature forged on fake court documents that led to the early release of two convicted murderers the court orders appeared legitimate , said @entity166 , with the county seal , letterheads and identical formatting to real papers			1
whoever created the documents had ' elementary knowledge ' , according to the judge			0
it is not the first time a @entity14 convict has used a forged signature from a judge to secure his release			1
when judge @entity181 heard of @entity9 and @entity8 ' escape his ' reaction was " oh no , not again " , ' he told @entity183			1
in 2009 @entity184 , 44 , used a forged court order bearing judge @entity181 's name to escape prison , where he was serving a sentence for theft			2
@entity9 and @entity8 were doing time for more serious crimes however			1
@entity9 was serving life for a second - degree murder committed in @entity121 in april 1999			0
set free : both men walked out of the @entity195 in @entity14 after corrections officers were duped by falsified court documents saying the prisoners had been granted an early release he told investigators at the time that he had intended to frighten 23 - year - old @entity203 whom he said had been intimidating him			1
@entity9 fired three shots , one of which struck @entity203 and killed him			0
@entity8 was also serving life in prison for the first - degree murder of a father of six in @entity212 in september 1998			2
