when @entity1 prime minister @entity0 addresses a joint session of the @entity3 on march 3 , an important chair in the @entity6 chamber might be empty			1
@entity6 press secretary @entity7 refused to say on wednesday whether vice president @entity8 would attend			1
his absence would be conspicuous – not only because he represents president @entity10 , but also because he officially presides over the @entity11			1
' the vice president 's schedule for that week has not yet been set , ' @entity7 told reporters			0
' so as we get some more details worked out of his schedule , we 'll be able to let you know whether or not he 'll be able to attend that joint session			2
' @entity21 's @entity20 gives vice presidents the role of @entity11 ' president , ' a role that 's largely ceremonial but can include casting tie - breaking votes when legislation hits a 50 - 50 deadlock			1
members of both houses of @entity3 have gathered in the @entity6 chamber 18 times since @entity10 took office , including those annual presidential speeches			1
' the vice president has only missed one , ' @entity7 said wednesday			0
' he missed one back in march of 2011 when then - @entity51 prime minister @entity50 spoke before a joint session of @entity3			1
' @entity8 was overseas on visits to @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 at the time			0
other heads of state have also addressed @entity3 in the @entity10 era , including the leaders of the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65			2
@entity0 spoke to a joint session of @entity3 in may 2011 , delivering a passionate defense of his country to thunderous applause and 29 standing ovations – four more than @entity10 had received during that year 's @entity38 address			1
@entity8 was among those cheering			0
but his attendance in march , @entity7 said , ' is going to be contingent on his schedule			0
' @entity0 's speech in 2011 was aimed squarely at @entity10 , a flat rejection of using @entity1 's 1967 borders as a starting point for a peace deal with the @entity80			1
' @entity1 will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967 , ' he declared			0
' @entity1 on the 1967 lines would be only 9 miles wide , ' @entity0 added later			2
' so much for defensible borders			0
' this time around the israeli prime minister is concerned about the threat of a nuclear - armed @entity86 , and is preparing another rhetorical cruise missile to lob at the @entity88			1
@entity10 has fended off threats from members of both parties in @entity3 to level new sanctions on @entity93 as the @entity95 's mullahs drag negotiatons over their nuclear program to a slow crawl			1
@entity6 and @entity11 leaders believe @entity86 is playing for time while it gears up a weapons program , but @entity93 insists it wants to maintain reactors for energy – although @entity86 sits atop the world 's third - largest oil reserves			1
the @entity6 , however , insists that tightening the screws now would give @entity86 a rationale for ending the talks entirely			2
the latest spat unfolding along the length of @entity111 in @entity108 was put on ice when senators agreed to hold off on a new round of sanctions until march 24			0
@entity0 is a fierce critic of how @entity10 and his @entity116 have handled the years - long negotiations			1
@entity36 , the @entity119 @entity118 who presides over the @entity121 , extended his invitation on january 21			2
, decidedly going behind @entity10 's back and putting the @entity6 in a difficult position			2
@entity7 announced the next day that @entity10 would n't be meeting with @entity0 while he was in @entity108			2
@entity0 received 29 standing ovations during his 2011 speech – that 's four more than @entity10 got during that year 's @entity38 address ' we have a longstanding practice of not meeting with democratically elected officials shortly before their election , ' he said , noting that the @entity1 will go to the polls on march 17			1
' and the reason for that is we want to avoid even the appearance of any kind of interference with a democratic election			0
' @entity7 continued to snipe at @entity118 on wednesday , dismissing @entity36 's invitation as a ' breach in protocol ' that could elevate relations between @entity21 republicans and @entity1 's @entity145 above @entity21 's broader relations with @entity1			1
he also acknowledged that several senior @entity148 lawmakers have openly discussed boycotting the march 3 speech			1
' the president believes that individual members ought to decide for themselves , ' @entity7 said			0
' that 's certainly appropriate			0
' several prominent @entity154 democrats including @entity156 rep. @entity155 met with @entity1 ambassador to the @entity21 @entity158 on wednesday , airing their complaints			0
@entity160 : rep. @entity155 hosted a group of disaffected @entity154 democrats for a meeting with @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity21 @entity158 @entity165 : @entity167 @entity148 sen. @entity166 ( right ) says having @entity0 address @entity3 is ' obviously political ' no rsvp yet : senate minority whip @entity169 of @entity170 says he may or may not show up for @entity0 's speech @entity172 , the speaker of @entity1 's @entity173 – its parliament – met separately with @entity6 minority leader @entity175			1
@entity1 told the @entity176 that @entity148 became furious when @entity36 ' decided that @entity1 would be a political football and he 'd spike it in the end zone			2
' others in the meeting included @entity182 rep. @entity181 , @entity156 reps			0
@entity184 and @entity185 , @entity187 rep. @entity186 , @entity170 rep. @entity188 and @entity187 rep. @entity189 , who also chairs the @entity190			0
@entity36 insists that the @entity121 is part of a branch of the @entity21 government that 's co-equal with the @entity6 , and has the right to invite @entity0 to ' talk to the members of @entity3 about the serious threat that @entity86 poses and the serious threat of radical @entity198			1
' in the @entity11 , @entity167 's @entity166 is also weighing a boycott			0
' my concern is that it 's obviously political , and it uses the backdrop of the @entity121 , and the @entity11 and the @entity6 , two weeks before a political campaign , and violates all the protocol that 's always existed in terms of working this out with the president , ' she told the @entity208			2
@entity170 @entity148 sen. @entity169 said he may or may not go : ' i have n't made up my mind			0
' @entity211 @entity210 sen. @entity210 , who along with @entity213 democrati sen. @entity212 has been pushing for a new sanctions regime on @entity86 , said empty seats on march 3 would be a disgrace			1
' i think that would not be appropriate treatment of the prime minister of @entity1 , and i 'm sure they can respond to their constituents as to why they would do that , ' @entity210 fumed			1
@entity212 told @entity223 that he wo n't miss @entity0 's speech			0
' from my perspective , if he is here , i 'll probably be attending , ' he said			0
@entity0 has other challenges on his mind with his position at stake in the march 17 election			0
his @entity145 has launched an ad mocking rivals @entity232 and @entity234 as unqualified stewards of @entity1 's children – while he , the ' @entity0 , ' can take better care of their futures			0
the two challengers , known to @entity1 as ' @entity240 and @entity234 , ' would trade off prime minister duties if their coalition can drive @entity145 from power .			2

@entity118 house speaker @entity36 invited the @entity1 prime minister to address a joint session of @entity3 on march 3
vice *presdient* @entity8 has the constitutional role of ' president ' of the @entity11 , and can cast deciding votes in 50 - 50 ties
he is seen with @entity36 behind president @entity10 during @entity38 addresses
@entity8 has missed only one joint session of @entity3 in 6 years when he was out of the country , but might not show up for @entity0
' @entity0 ' is *expected* to ask @entity3 to hit @entity86 with new *punitive* sanctions , something the @entity6 says would derail nuclear negotiations
some senior *congressional* democrats are considering a boycott of the speech in order to *embarass* @entity0 and the @entity118
