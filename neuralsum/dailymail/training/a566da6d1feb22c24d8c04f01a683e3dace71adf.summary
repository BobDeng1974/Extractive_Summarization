forecasters will soon measure the weather in space from a new operations branch set up by the @entity4			1
the @entity5 will open next week in @entity6 after years of preparation and millions of pounds of investment			1
it was created in 2011 after the government added @entity11 to the @entity12			0
solar flares and coronal mass ejections are among weather phenomenons forecasters will be watching out for in the new space weather centre from next week , anyone will be able to find out about weather in earth 's orbit and look out for potential disruptions			1
while immediate effects of weather in space are not always experienced on earth , solar storms can cause power outages or satellite failure across the world			1
coronal mass ejections coronal mass ejections ( or @entity32 ) are huge bubbles of gas threaded with magnetic field lines that are ejected from the @entity36 over the course of several hours			2
they disrupt the flow of the solar wind and produce disturbances that strike the @entity42 with sometimes catastrophic results			0
solar flares another type of explosion that occurs on the sun which can disrupt earth 's connection to satellites			1
information provided by @entity52 the need to monitor such risks has become even greater , say experts , as society is ever more dependent on technology			0
the @entity4 has teamed up with the @entity58 to build the centre which opens on wednesday			2
among the team 's tasks will be to pinpoint possible sources of disruption near the sun. ' we 'll be analysing sun spots to see how complex they are , ' @entity65 , a met office space forecaster told the @entity70			0
' we know that certain sunspot groups are very unlikely to produce coronal mass ejections , wheras others are highly likely to			0
' so we can forecast an elevated risk of a big solar flare or one of these @entity76 happening			0

@entity4 is to open a @entity5 on wednesday
forecasters will monitor solar flares and magnetic storms in earth 's orbit
disruptions can ruin satellite signals and wipe out power grids
