@entity52 babe : @entity6 's £ 475 the @entity41 bag is described on the brand 's website as a ' striking shoulder bag with a modern edge ' - cue a sell out famous fans : @entity32 fans include @entity123 , left , and @entity124 , right new favourite : clearly bored of her beloved @entity35 and @entity37 tote , the @entity34 - born artist , pictured with @entity10 and the bag last week , is championing little - known @entity39 brand , @entity32 @entity131 , hair stylist to multiple @entity133 clients spanning film , fashion , music and business , shares a few tips on achieving that fabulous finish on a blow dry in between salon visits			1
@entity142 is crucial – all washes are not created equal ' it ’s really important to select the right shampoo and conditioner that begins the journey to the ultimate polished finish – a shampoo and conditioner that clean and hydrate without harshness or weighing hair down – it ’s a crucial balance			2
water temperature is also vital to get right – make it luke warm to cool			2
hot water opens the scalp ’s sebaceous glands which stimulates an unhelpful grease risk			2
' @entity131 , hair stylist to multiple @entity133 clients spanning film , fashion , music and business , shares a few tips on achieving @entity6 's fabulous finish easy on the product – less is absolutely more ' this really is the most common blow dry blunder : overloading the hair with too much product			1
it ’s true that damp hair is the first step in introducing something that assists styling , but when you select the right product you really do need very little of it			2
before applying squeeze and pat dry with a towel , avoid rough drying			0
also place the product in the centre of your hand and warm it before applying first at the roots through the middle and to the ends			0
' @entity131 recommends : @entity191 ( for fine or blonde hair ) – ' apply a small amount from mid-length to ends			0
an extra tiny amount can be applied after blow drying to tame any fly - aways or condition dry ends even more			1
' direction ? back to front – literally ' divide the hair into two sections , start atthe back and work your way forward			0
this technique contributes significantly to how long the blow dry lasts			0
if you ’d like some movement in the end result , pin the section your not working on up , this gives that lift @entity6 has at the root that gives body but not bouffant			1
' tension is a good thing – for a blow dry ! ' introducing tension and pressure at the root with a barrel brush with dryer nozzle pointed downwards to smooth the hair shaft as it goes gives the shine in the finish ( equally a dryer than dries quickly helps here			0
the @entity230 dryer dries from the inside out so locks in moisture and helps minimise frizz and drying time )			0
the super sleek end result is entirely down to firm pressure with the right brush as you blow dry			0
it creates root movement , and this very movement at the root is like the scaffolding of the blow dry you construct			0
use a top quality anti-static round brush from the beginning until just before the polish stage			0
' @entity131 recommends : @entity252 – ' those looking for extra volume can spray a little on the roots at this stage of the blow dry			0
' @entity256 – it ’s all in the finish ' change tools here as your prepare to really invest in a high shine , clean finish for your blow dry			0
use a paddle brush to dry the remaining ends , and then comb through each section with straighteners			0
spray hairspray up and in as opposed to directly onto the crown – it 'll weigh it down			0
