by @entity1 reporter published : 16:13 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 16:37 est , 30 march 2012 charges against 27 students recently accused of hazing have been dropped by @entity5 today			1
through its judicial affairs office , the @entity7 school had charged more than a quarter of the @entity10 's members of violating school policy			1
the members were accused of threatening physical harm to new fraternity members , putting other students in fear for their safety and / or engaging in hazing during the fall 2011 term			1
allegations : senior @entity20 , right , claims @entity10 fraternity brothers forced he and other members to swim vomit			1
@entity10 's @entity5 president @entity24 , left , said no such events occurred during the 2011 pledgings animal house : more than a quarter of @entity10 's brotherhood had been accused of hazing after a former pledge said he and others were forced to swim in a kiddie pool of vomit and other bodily fluids the students also were accused of providing alcohol to underage students , providing drugs and / or providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated individuals during the same time period			1
the charges were based largely on allegations made by former fraternity member @entity20 , who went public in january with allegations of ' dehumanizing ' experiences he said he witnessed at the fraternity			1
in a column for the school newspaper , @entity20 said the fraternity pressured pledges to swim in a kiddie pool of rotten food , vomit and other bodily fluids ; eat omelets made of vomit ; and chug cups of vinegar			1
he called those activities the norm rather than the exception on @entity65 campus , and he criticized the administration for not doing enough when he made anonymous complaints last year			2
brotherhood : 27 members of the fraternity face identical charges , according to @entity10 's president ( there is no suggestion that any of those pictured here face charges ) taking action : more than more than 100 faculty members wrote to the @entity5 administration , describing hazing as an ' open secret ' and calling on the administration to set up a task force to address it on friday , college spokesman @entity85 said initial information presented to the college supported the hazing charges , but it did n't hold up under further scrutiny			1
' accordingly , all those charges against individuals have been rescinded , ' he told @entity92			0
' organizational charges against @entity10 remain pending			2
' the fraternity 's former president , @entity24 , declined to comment friday			2
he has said that nothing @entity20 described , and nothing remotely close to hazing , occurred at the fraternity in the fall 2011 pledge term			2
@entity10 provides all of its members with anti-hazing and risk management education and , several years ago , launched a comprehensive anti-hazing program called we stand together			1
source : @entity10 's national website by then , the fraternity had gotten rid of any traditions that would be " deemed problematic " by the administration , @entity24 said , and no current members of @entity10 were members in 2009 when @entity20 was a pledge			1
he suggested the charges were a knee - jerk reaction to bad press , a suggestion college administrators strongly denied			0
officials also denied that the college failed to act on @entity20 's initial complaints			0
the college recently created a task force on hazing			1
administrators also have said they see hazing as part of a larger problem , tied together with binge drinking and sexual assault , and have taken steps to address all three through the @entity128 the college launched last year			2
apart from the college , @entity65 police also have been investigating @entity20 's claims , but police chief @entity133 has said criminal charges are unlikely , in large part because @entity20 is not cooperating with police			0
@entity20 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on friday			0
ms @entity139 , the college administrator , had strongly denied both mr @entity20 's allegation that the college failed to act on his initial complaints			0
she said the administration already had been working hard to tackle the issue of hazing and was not simply responding to the recent allegations and faculty pressure			2
for example , the college hired a new director of @entity152 organizations who had been credited with turning around the fraternity and sorority system at another college , has hired two sexual assault coordinators and is in the process of hiring another alcohol and drug abuse counsellor			0
the college sees hazing as part of a larger problem , tied together with binge drinking and sexual assault , and has taken steps to address all three through the @entity128 it launched last year			0
' clearly we put our resources where our mouth is , ' she said			0
' this idea that we have somehow thrown up our hands , said there 's nothing we can do about hazing or other high risk behaviour going on college campuses is a complete mischaracterization			0
' ms @entity139 also said college officials did everything they could when mr @entity20 made his anonymous complaints , but the tips he provided did n't pan out			0
there are credibility issues surrounding mr @entity20 â€™s include mr @entity20 's 2010 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and witness tampering and a 2011 disorderly conduct conviction , following a confrontation with a security officer during @entity192 festivities .			0

former @entity5 member has accused @entity10 fraternity of pressuring pledges to eat vomit omelettes and chug cups of vinegar
