more than 80 of the 500 commemorative plants in @entity9 , @entity10 , were carefully dug out of the soil in two late - night attacks			1
it is thought the thieves were jealous and wanted the red flowers for their own gardens distraught : 86 of 500 memorial geraniums in @entity9 , @entity10 , to honour @entity7 soldiers were ' intricately ' dug up in late - night raids			1
@entity19 , chair of the parish council , said the thieves were jealous ' calculated ' : mr @entity19 said the attack was too clean to be done by vandals as police interview villagers @entity25 chairman @entity19 said : ' it is clear to us all that they have been taken by people who are so impressed with the displays that they want them in their own gardens			1
it is either that or people think that they can sell them on at car boot sales or something similar			2
' each time the flowers have been taken away very carefully so it can not be vandals otherwise they would have been strewn everywhere			2
' it seems to us all that these plants have just ended up in a lot of people ’s gardens			2
' the £ 300 flowers were planted last week as part of the village 's efforts to mark the centenary of the @entity7			1
two days later , residents awoke to find 40 of the poppy - red geraniums missing			1
the next morning , a further 46 had been intricately dug up			1
police have now been dispatched to the rural @entity10 community - where the population is just 475 - to take statements about the thefts in what is being dubbed a ' bloom - dunnit ' by locals			1
honour : the red plants , a nod to poppies , were bedded last week in honour of @entity7 soldiers investigation : police have been dispatched to the @entity70 town , which has one of @entity73 's lowest crime rates villager @entity74 , 59 , said : ' it ’s despicable really , what some people will do in this day and age			1
flowers have been stolen before but not on this scale - and they obviously wanted them			1
' i doubt very much people from round here will have taken them			0
it ’s a nice area and people would not steal from the neighbours			0
it ’s such a shame because there is never any crime in @entity9			1
' it would nice to think they would put the plants back after the upset that has been caused - but i ’m not holding my breath			2
' @entity97 , who lives on a barge near to the village and works at a tea room said : ' nothing bad ever happens here so it ’s a shock			0
' the people who did this must be putting the plants in their own garden			0
it was a nice thing to do to have the flowers so it just shows what people are like today			2
' it ’s such a shame but it wo n’t be anyone from the village			0
we ’ve never had anything stolen in @entity9 before			1
it ’s the kind of place where you can leave your stuff outside and no one will take it			0
' @entity124 , 75 , lives in the village , said : ' we were all devastated			0
a lot of people had put a lot of time into making this flower bed look lovely			0
' it ’s always had a nice show of flowers so i do n’t know why anyone would want to ruin it			2
they must want to sell them i guess			0
search : mr @entity19 has urged police to check people 's gardens for the plants after the rare attack on the village historic : the quaint village of 450 people in leafy @entity10 has 45 listed buildings and a 197 - acre deer park ' the villagers have been talking about nothing else but no - one can think who it might be who is responsible			1
my son ’s a farmer so he helped fetch the plants and plant them so it ’s a shame it has been ruined			0
