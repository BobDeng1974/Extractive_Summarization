outrage sparked by photos showing @entity1 , who gave birth seven months ago , with double chin fans say actress , 38 , should lose weight fast ' like @entity7 did ' she is a former @entity8 , a successful @entity10 star and married to the son of one of @entity14 's best - loved stars			1
she found international fame in the @entity17 film @entity16 , and @entity18 billed her as the world 's most beautiful woman			2
thanks to the notoriety such fame and fortune has brought her , @entity1 has become one of the most admired and revered women in @entity14 , and indeed the world			1
but such fame has come at a cost for the 38 - year - old star			1
since the birth of her daughter in november last year , @entity1 has been open about the fact that she is in no hurry to lose the few extra pounds she gained during her pregnancy			1
' but with the star , who married @entity48 , the son of @entity14 's most loved film star @entity49 in 2007 , tipped for her 10th appearance at @entity51 next week , furious speculation is mounting as to how she will look			2
commentators have been unkind , lambasting the star for letting her fans down			2
many have gone a step further , suggesting the star has a ' duty ' to her fans to regain her pre-pregnancy figure			2
one website posted a video of the star looking less than her usual svelte self , flicking between photographs of her pre-birth , and photos now			2
svelte : @entity1 at the @entity68 last february when she was in the very early stages of her pregnancy , and at last year 's @entity71 in may , six months before she gave birth to her daughter called ' @entity1 's shocking weight gain ' , the clip , which came accompanied by elephant sound effects , has been seen more than 500,000 times			1
dozens more videos in a similar vein have been posted , each with viewing figures in the tens or hundreds of thousands			0
comments left after the video prove that many of those watching have little sympathy for @entity1			1
' she is a @entity10 actress and it is her duty to look good and fit , ' one said			2
another added : ' she needs to learn from people like @entity7 who are back to size zero weeks after their delivery			1
' it has opened up a debate in the country , and beyond , about the attitudes held towards women in the public eye			0
some unkind fans have compared @entity1 to @entity7 , saying she should lose weight as quickly as ms @entity7 did after her four pregnancies ' @entity1 is like a goddess , ' said showbusiness columnist @entity102 in the @entity103 by way of explanation			1
' she is held up as the ideal of beauty and so there is an expectation on her to look perfect at all times			0
' ' the most beautiful woman in the world ' : @entity1 won @entity8 in 1994 ' the role models being held up are @entity114 and @entity7 , but our body frames are different – we have wider hips and curves – so this whole business of looking desperately skinny two weeks after giving birth is a western import			1
' cinema professor @entity122 added that women in @entity14 were up against an almost impossible task			0
' there is a glorification of motherhood in @entity14 and @entity14 cinema , ' he told the paper			0
' but people are confused because they do n't know whether to glorify @entity1 in her new motherhood or lament that she is not looking like a runway model			1
' it 's safe to say that far too many fall into the latter category , judging by the cruel comments flooding internet sites			0
some , however , have come out in defence of the star , saying that she , like any new mother , should be focusing on her infant , not her diet			0
' she is a real women looking after a baby			0
we should be concern for her health and happiness especially if she is nursing the baby			0
not the @entity151 belief of expecting people in the spot light to lose all weight in month			1
if she ﻿ dieted what will happen to the baby 's diet , ' one said			0
' that 's because @entity161 is not one of those selfish ones who puts the focus on their bodies instead of their babies , which makes them moody and ineffective as parents , ' another said			0
' kudos to you @entity161 for keeping it real and letting your baby have all the bonding and attention she needs with you			0
' video : one of @entity1 's recent hits was in @entity178 , 2010			1
