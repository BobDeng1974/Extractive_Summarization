by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's death at the age of 85 has , among other things , prompted the question , ' what role will his children now play at @entity9 ? ' while @entity10 led the takeover of the club in 2005 , since 2006 he has left the day - to - day running of the club to his sons - indeed , he has never set foot in @entity16			1
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are regularly seen at the ground but the other three , @entity21 and @entity22 and their sister @entity23 follow their father 's ' lesser spotted ' policy			1
getting the @entity28 in : @entity17 ( right ) , @entity19 ( left ) and @entity18 ( second left ) at @entity16 just after the 2005 takeover the @entity3 family own 90 per cent of @entity9 - all split equally with 10 per cent listed on the @entity31			1
that means @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 could have more involvement at @entity16 now - indeed , they could have the future of the club in their hands			1
it is unlikely they would want to sell their shares , given the strong family bond			0
@entity9 are insisting it is business as usual but the death of the family head could affect how the sextet run the club			2
taking stock : @entity47 ( third left ) and @entity17 ( third right ) with @entity9 officials in @entity51 in 2012 the two most high - profile @entity28 are @entity17 and @entity18 , the executive co-chairmen			1
@entity17 is the oldest of the six children and headed the @entity9 takeover in 2005			1
he and his brother @entity18 have been prominent figures ever since , taking over the day - to - day running of the club in 2006 after their father had a stroke			0
they had the final say on the appointment of new manager @entity65			0
@entity18 is also actively involved in the running of @entity9 , speaking to @entity67 up to three times a day about all aspects of the club			1
passed away : @entity3 ( right ) , pictured with sons @entity18 ( left ) and @entity19 in 2005 , has died aged 85 of the other powerbrokers at @entity9 , @entity71 is the most prominent			1
he joined @entity9 in 2005 when he acted as an adviser in the @entity3 family ’s controversial £ 790million takeover and was invited to join the club soon afterwards			1
@entity67 was initially involved in @entity9 ’s financial planning before being handed responsibility for the club ’s commercial and media operations in 2007			0
@entity67 became a director in 2012 and played a key role in @entity9 ’s £ 1.37billion flotation on the @entity31 in august of that year			0
it was no surprise therefore that he was chosen to replace chief executive @entity86 when he stood down in june , although @entity71 retained his existing title of executive vice-chairman and remains based at the club ’s @entity90 corporate headquarters			0
holding the keys : @entity67 ( left ) and @entity9 group managing director @entity93 family affair : @entity17 ( left ) and @entity47 are joint executive co-chairman at @entity9 sir @entity95 will always be an iconic figure at @entity9 and was instrumental in choosing @entity97 as his successor as manager and was part of the panel which picked @entity102			1
the most successful boss in @entity9 's history was a frequent presence at matches last season as the club recorded their worst @entity110 finish			2
it will be interesting to see whether he is spotted at @entity16 as regularly now @entity102 is in charge			2
@entity95 's close ally @entity86 is @entity9 ’s former chief executive and remains an influential figure on the club ’s football board			2
it is thought by some observers that @entity9 made a mistake by letting him leave the same summer as @entity95 and it has turned out that way			0
@entity120 was also consulted about @entity102 's appointment			0
the legend : long - serving boss sir @entity95 still holds power at @entity16 despite his retirement @entity93 , the group managing director , was promoted from commercial director in the shake - up that saw @entity67 replace @entity120 in 2013			0
he is the most senior figure at @entity16 on a day - to - day basis and together with @entity71 , has trebled @entity9 ’s commercial revenue over the course of the next seven years , closing deals with major sponsors all over the globe			2
sir @entity134 is , of course , a @entity9 legend , who became a director in 1984			0
@entity134 was a key figure in @entity95 ’s appointment in 1986 and continues to be a respected voice on team - related affairs			0
icon : long - serving @entity9 stalwart sir @entity134 still holds power in the halls of @entity16			2

@entity3 's six children own 90 per cent of @entity9
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are regularly spotted at @entity16
@entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 are *rarely* seen
