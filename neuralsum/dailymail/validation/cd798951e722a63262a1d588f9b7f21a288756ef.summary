president @entity10 's administration , along with @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , have been engaged in highly confidential talks with @entity3			2

upon his return to @entity26 , mr @entity37 said : ' after my short visit to the @entity23 , i return to @entity0 knowing that many around the world heard what @entity0 has to say about the impending deal with @entity3			1
' mr @entity22 wanted any proposed deal dependent upon @entity3 denouncing terrorism world wide and ceasing its ongoing sponsorship of jihadi organisations			1
the @entity54 reported that @entity23 intelligence agencies discovered @entity0 officials discussing information that could have only been gathered from inside the confidential talks			1
a senior @entity23 official told the @entity54 : ' it is one thing for the @entity23 and @entity0 to spy on each other			1
it is another thing for @entity0 to steal @entity23 secrets and play them back to @entity23 legislators to undermine @entity23 diplomacy a @entity2 source said : ' people feel personally sold out			1
that ’s where the @entity0 really better be careful because a lot of these people will not only be around for this administration but possibly the next one as well			0
' a spokesman for mr @entity75 rejected the espionage claims			0
' these allegations are utterly false			0
the state of @entity0 does not conduct espionage against the @entity23 or @entity0 ’s other allies			1
the false allegations are clearly intended to undermine the strong ties between the @entity23 and @entity0 and the security and intelligence relationship we share			1
' this denial was reiterated by the country 's outgoing foreign minister @entity87 : ' this report is not true			0
obviously @entity0 has security interests to defend and we have our own intelligence			2
but we do not spy on the @entity23			0
there are enough participants in these negotiations , including @entity3			0
' we got our intelligence from other sources , not from the @entity23			2
the instruction has been clear for decades now : you do n’t spy on the @entity23 , directly or indirectly			0
' @entity23 secretary of state @entity100 , left , has been engaged in the high level negotiations with @entity3 's foreign minister @entity102 , right , in @entity103 , @entity104			2
the talks are expected to resume tomorrow the @entity0 government has strongly denied spying on the talks which are being held in @entity104 however , reaction in @entity6 among @entity5 to possible deal with @entity3 has been hostile , with one senior senator warning that the @entity2 faces ' a violent backlash ' if it bypasses @entity113 and instead brings the deal to the @entity115			1
the negotiations concern a promise to loosen economic sanctions on @entity119 if the @entity3 administration pledges to cease development of nuclear weapons			2
@entity5 senator @entity123 threatened to pass legislation in the @entity125 in april to require congressional oversight of any deal before it can be brought to the @entity115 the deal is being discussed by the five permanent members of the @entity130 and if agreement is reached , it is expected that it will receive the full backing of the @entity115			2
senator @entity32 told the @entity134 in @entity135 : ' that would be met with a violent response in the @entity6			0
i do n't think that 's good for the country - to take a deal that could affect world order to an international body before you take it to your own people			0
' @entity5 senator @entity146 , the chairman of the @entity147 , introduced the bipartisan bill to give @entity6 a vote on any agreement reached			1
the bill would require the president to submit the text of any agreement to @entity6 and would prohibit the administration from waiving any of the congressional sanctions for 60 days			2
during that time , lawmakers could hold hearings and approve , disagree or take no action on the deal			0
@entity0 wants any deal to include the dismantling of @entity3 's nuclear weapon development programme senator @entity146 , who introduced the measure with @entity166 senators @entity165 and @entity167 of @entity168 and @entity32 , already wrote to mr @entity10 warning him not to try to by - pass @entity6			1
in a letter , senator @entity146 told president @entity10 that letting the @entity115 consider such an agreement - while at the same time threatening to veto legislation that would allow @entity6 to vote on it - would be a ' direct affront ' to the @entity23 people and would undermine the role of @entity6			1
@entity3 president @entity29 said that substantial progress had been made on a possible deal , claiming ' there is nothing that can not be resolved '			0
the talks are taking place in @entity103 , @entity104 , and are expected to resume tomorrow after a two - day break			0
@entity0 's intelligence minister @entity183 has flown to @entity184 to directly lobby the @entity13 over the deal			2
he said that dialogue with @entity13 in the past over @entity3 's nuclear ambitions have proven ' productive ' in the past			0
he said : ' we do n't have a plan b , we only have a plan a and this is to try to prevent a bad deal with @entity3 or at least to try to make it more reasonable and to close some of the gaps and loopholes that made it even worse			0
' @entity0 diplomats believe that the @entity23 is willing to do a deal with @entity3			1
@entity0 officials claim they are only interested d in proposal which ' dismantles , not simply freezes ' @entity119 's nuclear weapon programme			0
former @entity0 ambassador to @entity14 @entity205 added : ' it 's only natural that given @entity37 's concern of a deal with @entity3 that he would turn to @entity13			1
