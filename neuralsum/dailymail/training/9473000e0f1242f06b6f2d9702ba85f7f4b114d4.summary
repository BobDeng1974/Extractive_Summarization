when @entity1 went to @entity2 this week to meet and greet their current shirt sponsor @entity4 it was significant that they chose @entity5 to represent them			1
with his 23rd birthday falling on thursday and already having clocked up more air miles than any of his team - mates since the summer , the @entity7 would have benefitted from the rest more than any other player in the dressing room , but needs must – @entity5 is the face of the future for @entity1 and when the club meets its biggest and most important sponsor , he has to be there			1
@entity4 are due to end their sponsorship of the club in 2016			2
if a new deal is to be agreed it will need to be finalised before the end of this year			0
with @entity5 and @entity28 turning up in @entity2 on wednesday there was talk that the sponsor was considering doubling its existing offer of € 30million ( £ 22.4million ) a year to € 60m ( £ 44.8m ) a year			1
@entity5 was chosen to go to @entity2 this week to represent @entity1 and meet their sponsors @entity4 @entity5 , since his move from @entity33 in june 2013 , has begun to cement himself as the face of @entity1 dressed in a fetching @entity36 shirt , @entity5 recently fronted a @entity4 television advert @entity1 are currently debating the possibilities of continuing with @entity39			1
that debate would be cut short if a firm offer of € 60m ( £ 44.8m ) is indeed made			0
the answer would be yes			0
with the @entity45 more determined than ever to cut off all perceived sources of state aid to the big clubs in @entity49 , private money is more important than ever and @entity1 need the @entity39 cash			2
@entity39 also need the association with the club and with the freshest face in football in @entity5 , whose kudos has rocketed in the last eight months with his heroic attempt to drag a poor @entity58 side to @entity60 glory and his 22 goals for @entity1 this season			1
as well as being crucial to the club ’s new shirt sponsorship deal , @entity5 will be integral to @entity1 ’s battle with @entity66 to improve the € 40m ( £ 29.9m ) a season offer currently in play			1
@entity1 want closer to the £ 75m that @entity69 will pay @entity70 every year from next season			2
they believe having one of the @entity76 sport ’s brand ’s top clients in @entity5 should entitle them to that			0
@entity5 ( left ) and @entity28 represented @entity1 in @entity2 to launch a marketing campaign this week it seems @entity5 ( right ) is taking the mantle from @entity81 , who has so often been the front of campaigns @entity1 are also in negotiations with two broadcasters for the rights to show their games next season			1
the pressure from the @entity90 government to force @entity91 and @entity1 by law to negotiate with the other 18 clubs and share the income has completely stalled and the @entity96 club are trying to improve on their current € 140m ( £ 105.5m ) a season deal			0
again @entity5 ’s part in promoting whichever company wins the rights , will be of vital importance			0
back at training on thursday , the day of his birthday , he was congratulated by his team - mates and there were messages from all over the world including from the last magical @entity7 to light up the @entity108 , @entity109 , and from @entity110 who had predicted so many ‘ new @entity114 ’ that he was always going to get one right in the end and seems to have done so with @entity5			0
@entity1 need @entity5 to work for them as much off the pitch as on it to justify the outlay of what now looks like more than € 90m ( £ 67.2m ) for the player they bought from @entity33 in a convoluted deal that involved 11 different contracts to both the club and the player ’s parents ' company @entity126 - a piece of cutting - edge financial engineering which they were proud of at the time but that has landed them in court with the @entity90 tax man wanting a greater share of the pot. a recent @entity137 advert features @entity5 in the dressing room - he is a hot property in the marketing world there does not seem to be any friction between @entity5 and @entity81 as the baton is passed between them the good news for the club is that the player is a natural at fulfilling his commercial responsibilities – handling the spotlight as well as @entity150 did at @entity91			1
one of the arguments @entity1 used to convince @entity5 to sign for them and not go to @entity91 , who made a late push , was that he would have less pressure in @entity155 playing alongside @entity81 and a host of @entity49 internationals who had won the @entity60			1
but now that the focus starts to shift gently from @entity81 to the @entity7 superstar four years his junior , there are no signs that he can not handle it			0
there are also no signs of conflict with @entity81 , something that @entity169 predicted when the @entity7 first arrived			0
‘ you ca n’t have two captains on the same boat ’ was his famous doomsday prediction , but from the moment @entity5 gave his first press conference and declared that he wanted to learn from @entity81 who he repeatedly called ‘ the best in the world ’ things have gone smoothly			2
neither does the @entity181 mind that some of the marketing burden , that he has always hated , is now shared			0
if both skippers are trying to sail in the same direction it seems there is not a problem and both @entity5 and @entity81 are doing their bit to make sure @entity1 stay financially ahead of their big @entity189 rivals			1
aged 27 @entity81 remains the image of the club that has won the @entity192 more than any side this century			0
but at 23 @entity5 is the face of the future .			2

@entity5 went to @entity2 this week to meet and greet sponsors @entity4
@entity81 has been the face of @entity1 for recent @entity189 *success*
it seems now that the times are changing , with @entity5 taking the mantle
there does not appear to be any friction between @entity81 and @entity5
