by @entity0 we 're used to seeing pictures of the @entity3 in faded brown sepia - dull , muddy , black - and - white photographs that seem to epitomise the drab khaki landscape of shell - blasted sludge that was the trenches in which they were taken			1
but , 100 years on , the wonders of 21st - century technology now allow us to see these amazing pictures of the conflict in breathtaking full colour , giving us a much keener sense of what it was actually like to be there			1
@entity21 photo technician @entity20 travelled back in time to colour this selection of images from the @entity25 's archive – specially selected to bring home the full horror of the conflict – exclusively for weekend magazine			1
bloodbath and mudbath seven stretcher bearers struggle to carry a wounded man to safety in @entity35 during the battle of @entity37 in 1917			2
prolonged shelling destroyed drainage ditches and turned the area around the shattered town of @entity42 into a quicksand of impassable sucking mud that would bog down wounded men and drown them still only 19 , @entity20 started to colour old black - and - white pictures purely as a hobby three years ago			1
' people would send me old photos of relatives and i would add colour and send them back , ' he says			1
' the more photos i did , the better i got at it			1
i guess that – as with most things in life – practice makes perfect			2
' working entirely digitally , @entity20 takes extraordinary pains to achieve exactly the right results			2
once the original photograph has been scanned into his computer , he starts with a base layer of colour for each object in the scene			1
' then the fine details are added on top , such as grains in wood or skin tones , buttons or intricate patterns in clothing			2
' pigeon post : pigeons were often used to carry messages from the front line when radio , morse code and human runners had failed			2
here an officer ( far right ) writes a message as the pigeon 's handler , having removed the bird from its cage , holds it upside down to attach the note giddy up : dismounted cavalrymen take a rest in a convenient shellhole while their mounts form a protective ring around them			2
horses proved ineffective in trench warfare , and by the war 's end they had effectively been replaced by tanks to do this , @entity20 magnifies the image to the point where individual pixels can be distinguished , then colours them in with a fine stylus from the huge range of shades available in the palette of his @entity109 software			2
it can take up to two days of focused concentration to finally bring a photo to life			2
' how long it takes depends on the complexity of elements in the original photo , ' he says			0
' how detailed it is , and how large the image is in terms of resolution			0
of course , the object is to make the photo look as if it was taken with a colour camera			1
highway to hell : soldiers gingerly make their way across a path made of wooden duckboards in @entity131 near @entity42 , @entity35 , during the battle of @entity37 in 1917			1
shelling has reduced the wood 's trees to gaunt skeletons there are so many things that have to come together for that to happen : the colour of different areas of the sky , for example , the reflections on anything shiny or wet , the tiniest details such as the blush in a soldier 's cheek on a cold day , and the warming colours on a hot one			1
it takes a lot of patience to get everything to work together , but when it does it looks great			0
' since it 's impossible to retrieve any sense of original colour from a black - and - white photo alone , the only way for @entity20 to accurately recreate the true colour of any object on an image is to find a colour photo of the same object – or to research it			1
sleeping it off : tommies snatch a few minutes ' shuteye during a well - deserved break from front - line duty , watched by men waiting to take their place			0
soldiers could spend days in the forward trenches with barely a wink of sleep up and at ' em ! @entity21 soldiers go into action , but the man in the foreground has fallen before even leaving the trench			1
note the reinforced concrete bunkers in the background which have already suffered heavy artillery pounding iron monsters : developed in secret by the @entity186 under @entity187 , tanks , or ' landships ' as they were originally known , first saw action on the @entity191 in september 1916			0
this one , named @entity193 , is clanking through the city of @entity195 to spearhead the @entity21 offensive there in april 1917			0
they were hellishly hot for their crews and liable to break down , but tanks helped end the deadlock of the trenches in 1918 survivors : soldiers of the original @entity205 return from the bloody battle of @entity207 in september 1915			1
@entity207 was the last in a series of failed @entity21 attacks that effectively destroyed the @entity205 and led to the firing of its commander , sir @entity211 , and the hiring of his successor , sir @entity214 , who kept the job for the rest of the war despite being accused of senselessly sending millions of men to their deaths doomed ? one of the most iconic images of the war shows soldiers of the @entity223 waiting to join the offensive on the @entity191 on 1 july , 1916			1
there were 60,000 @entity21 casualties that day - almost 20,000 died			0
the battle continued until mid-november , but no other day produced such appalling losses since , for example , many uniforms from the war still survive it was simple enough for @entity20 to reproduce their exact shades			0
' but if i ca n't source an original object i can often find a replica on the internet			0
i 've even found items on @entity239			0
' some things , however , are simply left to the artist 's instinct and @entity20 admits that ' there will always be an element of artistic licence in colourisation , but accuracy will always be striven for '			0
because we 're used to the blazing colours of modern photography , these pictures may look muted to us			0
but , says @entity20 , that perfectly suits the faded look of old photographs			0
' usually old black - and - white photos will have faded , so the colours need to be toned down to match			1
' but however muted the colours , the raw horror of war leaps out of these images for us all to see			0
@entity261 : a @entity262 befriends two @entity264 children in june 1916			0
such images of the @entity267 - @entity21 alliance in action were useful propaganda but belied often edgy relations between soldiers and local civilians , who were accused of overcharging their defenders			1
the soldier belongs to the @entity276 , the @entity277 ( @entity278 ) , a unit raised from civil servant volunteers in the capital @entity281 to hell : @entity21 troops pose in a railway carriage en route to the front in 1916			0
a sign on the sliding door on the right proclaims ' @entity290 ' and ' @entity291 ' : the men often had to share their transport with horses before disaster struck : women workers stack live shells destined for the trenches at the huge munitions factory at @entity300 in @entity301 in 1917			1
a few months later , on 1 july , 1918 , 250 workers were killed when eight tons of @entity304 explosive at the factory blew up			0
only 32 bodies could be positively identified girl power : as the war went on , more and more men left for the trenches			2
the gaps in the labour market were increasingly filled by women - like these female navvies pushing barrows of rubble - carrying out tasks previously only thought suitable for men			0

most @entity3 imagery is black and white , but the @entity321 has been given exclusive access to restored colour photos
the *collection* looks back at the trials and *triumphs* of our soldiers who risked their lives in the trenches
