for a man whose team began this tournament by putting five past the @entity4 , @entity0 is becoming adept at lowering expectations			1
' we are not a fantastic team , ' said the @entity9 manager on friday night			1
' we just a team that ’s difficult to beat			2
' this is very much @entity12 ’s way these days			2
so tired of criticism of his team in the run - up to this @entity17 , the veteran coach has decided to play along			2
' the children from the head of our sponsors made it , ' said @entity12			2
' i was given it because her children made it and i promised to wear it			0
i will wear it again			0
i will always wear it when i 'm coach of @entity9			1
that 's another three matches , as you know			1
' if the incoming manager of @entity53 is to leave his current post in the most memorable way possible then there is likely to be some excitement along the way			1
this @entity59 team is not one that does things quietly			1
@entity62 start : @entity9 began the tournament brilliantly by routing world champions @entity64 5 - 1 close control : @entity67 brings the ball down during a training session			1
the striker has overcome fitness doubts to be ready for the @entity73 encounter talking tactics : @entity75 in conversation with @entity77 as the @entity59 team prepare for the quarter - final clash eyes on the ball : @entity85 ( left ) , @entity82 ( centre ) and @entity84 ( right ) watch a cross during the training session alive and kicking : @entity88 warms up with some high kicks @entity12 spoke yesterday of the sense of togetherness and unity that he believes characterises this squad but @entity9 have still had to come from behind three times already to reach the last eight			1
' one of the things we can is turn a match round , ' said @entity12			0
' sometimes it ’s down to luck but also due to considering your chances and opportunities			0
' we have n't played as well in ball possession as we can at times but when the opposition have the ball we 're one of the best teams , if not the best			0
' that 's why we 've progressed so far			0
' race is on : @entity88 and @entity85 race each other on the pitch at the stadium in @entity116 practice makes perfect : @entity0 watches intently as @entity88 tries to curl home a free - kick blaster and the master : @entity12 analyses the technique of @entity123 as he prepares to take a shot on target : @entity9 's @entity123 fires the ball through a crowd of bodies to equalise against @entity129 back from the dead : van @entity0 's team were in trouble against @entity129 in the last 16 before a late turn - around @entity12 ’s insistence of playing on the counter has caused much debate at home			1
certainly it almost failed them against @entity129 in @entity141 last week when only two goals at the death saved them			0
however , it says much for his players ’ faith in @entity12 ’s philosophy that they adhere slavishly to his instructions , even if we may see them adopt a slightly more proactive approach at @entity152 today			1
' of course in @entity9 we 're used to playing 4 - 3 - 3 , attacking football with two wingers , ' said winger @entity88			1
' but i think you also have to look at the quality of the squad			0
that 's what we did , and what the manager did			2
eyes on the prize : @entity88 insists @entity9 need to go in for the kill for the remained of the @entity17 @entity168 attention : @entity9 's squad are all ears as @entity12 talks them through his plans the stage is set : @entity9 take on @entity73 at the @entity174 @entity173 on saturday talking tactics : @entity12 acknowledges that his team have not always been fluent , but they are getting results ' we spoke about it a lot with him and decided to play a slightly different system			1
' i think it 's very functional , maybe not as dominant as we are used to playing , but still very good			0
and we 've played four games and scored 12 goals , so that 's pretty positive			0
' i think we are on a mission together			0
we are here to win matches and to go as far as possible			2
' i do n't think the expectations were that high before the tournament and , as a result , we can be very proud of where we are			0

despite stellar start , @entity59 boss insists ' we are not fantastic '
@entity0 has caused *controversy* in @entity9 with tactical approach
but manager also claims he has ' another three matches '
