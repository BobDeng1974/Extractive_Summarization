by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 18 may 2013 @entity1 has threatened to pull the rug from under his coalition with @entity4 after a series of bitter rows that have rocked the government			1
the prime minister said he is prepared to run the country without his deputy pm unless @entity14 - @entity13 feuding that has paralysed his administration ends			1
mr @entity1 added he hopes to cling on to his ailing alliance with mr @entity4 as they tackle the economic crisis and other vital issues together			1
@entity1 said that he will govern without @entity4 if the feuding does n't end but in a move that could trigger an early general election , he said : ‘ the best way to do that is to continue with the @entity3 , but if that was n’t the case then we ’d have to face the new circumstances in whatever way we should			1
’ the innocent - sounding ‘ new circumstances ’ he refers to are the sensational prospect of an end to the @entity3			2
it is the first time mr @entity1 has publicly aired his fears his political marriage to mr @entity4 , sealed with sunny optimism at their @entity34 joint press conference in @entity36 three years ago , is about to end in divorce			1
revealing his frustration in a candid interview in @entity40 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i ’m here to deliver good government for the country and we ’ve still got important work to do – paying down the deficit , turning round the economy , and all the rest of it			2
‘ what matters to me , though , is can we get things done ? can we improve the state of the country ? can we fulfil our manifesto ? ’ if not , he continued , he was ready to ‘ face the new circumstances ’ – in other words , break up with mr @entity4 and run a minority @entity57			1
potentially , that could cause far more chaos than any @entity3 infighting			0
but @entity1 added that he would rather be with @entity4 when attempting to solve the economic crisis it was the lack of a @entity64 majority in 2010 that forced mr @entity1 to team up with mr @entity4			1
without the backing of @entity67 , there are insufficient conservative mps to get mr @entity1 ’s legislation through @entity70 on their own			2
in turn , that could force mr @entity1 to ask the @entity73 for permission to call an early general election , instead of waiting until 2015 , a key part of his 2010 pact with mr @entity4			1
alternatively , mr @entity1 and mr @entity4 could agree to an amicable divorce , with the @entity13 leader stepping down as deputy pm but supporting the @entity14 on some issues , making it possible for mr @entity1 to cling on to power – for the time being			1
it would allow them both to pursue their own separate manifestos in the run - up to the @entity89 are advantages to both leaders in a friendly split			2
mr @entity4 would get the chance to repair his battered reputation with @entity13 activists			1
and mr @entity1 , although weakened , would be freed of constant bickering between @entity14 and @entity97 and aides			1
mr @entity1 ’s comments follow reports that both he and mr @entity4 are facing up to going it alone in the run - up to the next election			1
in the @entity40 interview with @entity14 mp and author @entity106 , mr @entity1 vented his fury over the root cause of the @entity14 - @entity13 schism – mr @entity4 ’s u-turn on a pledge to back parliamentary boundary changes that would have made it easier for the @entity113 to win the next election			1
‘ that was immensely frustrating , ’ said mr @entity1			2
‘ @entity3 has its frustrations , there ’s no doubt about it , and we have disagreements			0
sometimes those disagreements mean you ca n’t take actions in the areas that you want to			0
’ mr @entity106 said the pm ’s comments could be a clear warning to mr @entity4 that he may be about to call an election			1
a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ the coalition will continue until 2015			0
’ @entity132 's economic policy has been savaged by his former guru as a ‘ beg , steal and borrow ’ approach , writes @entity135			0
lord @entity136 told a private audience of activists the @entity140 leadership was showing ‘ tin - eared contempt for the public ’ by sticking to the left - wing belief that the government should borrow billions to fund schools and hospitals			2
and the @entity147 quoted @entity148 ’ 1972 @entity150 entry @entity149 to bolster his argument against mr @entity132 and shadow chancellor @entity152			2
lord @entity136 said that the @entity140 leadership have showed a ' tin - eared contempt for the public ' he said : ‘ i think our position is like that 1970s terrible song			0
we ’re going to beg , then we ’re going to steal and then we ’re going to borrow to get the money – that ’s going to further humiliate people			0
’ last night the @entity113 seized on the remarks as a sign of a ‘ choreographed move ’ at the top of the party to unseat mr @entity152 – amid renewed speculation in the party about mr @entity132 ’s leadership			0
lord @entity136 ’s remarks emerged days after a poll showed that mr @entity132 ’s lead over the @entity14 had fallen to only three points			1
@entity136 , one of @entity140 ’s most influential thinkers , made his remarks in a private discussion on ‘ reforming the public services ’ at last week ’s progress conference , at which senior party figures gathered to discuss tactics for winning the next election			0
@entity136 quoted the @entity148 1972 @entity181 entry @entity182 he condemned the @entity184 approach for showing ‘ this tin - eared kind of contempt for the public that still permeates – no , no , no , if you spend more it will be better ’			0
he added : ‘ i think the state should be helping you help your mum – not we will help , we will take care of your mum			0
we ’ve got to partner up with people			0
’ his intervention comes as mr @entity132 faces increasing pressure to flesh out the party ’s economic policies			0
he admitted for the first time three weeks ago that @entity140 would have to borrow billions of pounds to fund its policies			0
when @entity201 contacted @entity136 last night , he burst out laughing and said : ‘ it just came to me suddenly – beg from the @entity202 , steal from the poor and borrow the rest			0
’ asked if he realised his comments would be seen as a direct attack on the @entity208 economic strategy , he said : ‘ well , we do n’t even know what that is .			0

@entity212 of minority government could trigger early general election
prepared to go without @entity4 unless @entity14 - @entity13 feuding ends
but added he hopes to cling on to his ailing alliance with mr @entity4
