by @entity0 @entity1 have expressed an interest in @entity4 central defender @entity3			0
@entity5 will move for a new centre - half if captain @entity7 leaves for @entity8			1
and @entity3 is on the @entity10 ’ radar as they make plans for the exit of @entity7			1
talented : @entity3 impressed for the champions @entity4 last season on his way : could @entity3 have played his last game for @entity4 ? the @entity18 international was watched extensively by @entity1 scouts during his time at @entity22 , but @entity4 moved quickly to snap up @entity3 in 2012 as he developed a reputation as one of the best emerging defenders in @entity26			1
despite missing out to @entity4 , the @entity28 club remain keen on @entity3 and are set to revive their interest should @entity7 leave			2
@entity3 ’s future at the @entity31 is unclear this summer due to the pending arrival of @entity33 from @entity34			0
@entity35 are also interested in @entity3 , 21 , who could cost £ 16million			1
experience : @entity7 is still a top player on his day frustrating : @entity7 has endured his fair share of injury woes over the last few years @entity39 could join @entity8 whether @entity7 completes a move to @entity41 remains to be seen , with the @entity10 far from convinced about selling their skipper			2
the @entity44 international has less than 12 months on his existing deal meaning he can leave on a free transfer next summer			0
but @entity5 knows letting @entity7 go , particularly after the departure of fourth - choice centre - back @entity50 , would leave him alarmingly short of options in the position			2
it is understood @entity5 would give serious consideration to a player - swap deal with @entity8			0
@entity5 has shown firm interest in @entity8 central defenders @entity59 and @entity60 in the past , and may look to include either in a deal for @entity7 .			0

the @entity10 will look to snap up the @entity18 defender if skipper @entity7 departs the club
@entity3 is believed to be valued at around £ 16million
@entity35 are also interested in the talented centre - half
