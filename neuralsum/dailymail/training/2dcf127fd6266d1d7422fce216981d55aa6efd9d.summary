@entity1 manager @entity0 insists his side have learned from last season 's crushing defeat by @entity5 and will go looking for the victory he hopes will kick - start their season			1
last april @entity8 , under whom @entity0 worked first time around at @entity10 , came to @entity11 with a tactical plan to stifle and frustrate and take advantage of any weakness			1
it worked perfectly as the then free - scoring home side failed to break down a disciplined defence and were caught twice on the counter-attack - the first coming , now famously , after @entity21 's slip allowed @entity22 to race through to score			1
@entity1 captain @entity21 walks off dejected to be consoled by his manager @entity0 ( left ) after his mistake led to their 2 - 0 defeat by @entity5 that ended their @entity28 title hopes last season @entity22 's strike changed complexion of the game and allowed @entity5 to pick @entity1 off on the counter @entity8 ( left ) and @entity5 ruined @entity1 's title dream last season in a spiky encounter the defeat was the beginning of the end of @entity1 's title dream but now the tables have turned and it is @entity5 who are in top spot , unbeaten in their opening 10 matches			1
@entity8 will have adapted his game plan for saturday but @entity0 insists his team are ready for the considerable challenge which awaits them , having already lost at home to @entity49 and been held by @entity50 and @entity51			1
' we will have learned from that			2
this is a new challenge and it will be a tough game , ' said @entity0			2
' @entity5 were obviously strong last year and they have big experience in their squad and know the league and that helps them massively			2
@entity0 looked relaxed in training on thursday , despite @entity1 's poor start to the season @entity0 will been keen to get striker @entity63 firing on all cylinders as soon as possible ' add to that the players who have come in and @entity66 , one of @entity69 's top strikers , and @entity70 , who knows the league and is a real creative force , and add ( @entity74 ) hazard to that who is one of the best young players in the world and they are a strong outfit			1
' this offers us a great chance at home to get a great result and then hopefully that can kick - start the season for us			1
' i can see the improvements in us day - by - day			0
' we 've had injuries and in patches we have shown the level of our game is okay but it is not consistent enough and we have n't scored as many goals as last season			0
' we are trying to find that solution and balance but that is something which is ongoing			0
' part of @entity0 ' problem is that few of his players are operating at the level they were in the second half of last season when they seemed destined to end their 24 - year wait for the title			1
@entity21 take a free - kick during training as @entity63 and @entity111 look on @entity1 forward @entity112 in action at their @entity115 headquarters on thursday it means he does not really know what his strongest team is , which is why all the furore over his team selection against @entity121 in midweek needed to be viewed with some degree of perspective			1
' my job is just to focus on our games , ' added the @entity129 boss			0
' i will always think in the best possible way for @entity1 and look at every performance making the fans proud and it will be the same this weekend when we will pick a team to win the game			2
' @entity136 and @entity137 were all smiles during training ahead of the visit of @entity5 @entity21 enjoys himself in the rain as @entity63 looks on during training on thursday while @entity0 will recall big names like @entity21 , @entity111 and @entity112 - all rested in the bernabeu - others may find they have been overtaken			1
with defence being such a problem again this season the performance of @entity147 , who had not started anything other a @entity150 match since mid-february , has put Â£ 20million summer signing @entity153 under threat			0
the 33 - year - old @entity155 international had come to be viewed as a centre - back always likely to make a mistake but he barely put a foot wrong against the world - class talent of @entity161 and @entity162			0
manager @entity0 issues instructions to his captain during training at @entity115 on thursday @entity147 turned in an impressive performance against @entity121 in the @entity168 on tuesday ' @entity147 was outstanding on the night and it is a great mark of his professionalism that he can come in and play as well as he did , ' said @entity0			2
' one of the reasons we wanted to bring him in was because he was the right type of character			0
' he knew that he may not play as many games as he has done in the past but his influence off the field and his character is contagious			0
' he loves football and has a wonderful enthusiasm for the game and whether he 's in the team or not , he 's always the same : supporting the players			0
' when called upon he can do a good job , as we saw the other night with his leadership qualities and organisation			0
' overall , i thought he and @entity190 were outstanding			0

@entity1 welcome @entity28 leaders @entity5 to @entity11 on saturday
@entity5 all but ended @entity1 's title challenge last season with 2 - 0 win
