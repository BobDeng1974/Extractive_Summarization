set aside the fact that our @entity1 is the defender of the @entity3			2
ignore the 26 @entity5 bishops who sit in the @entity6			2
pay no attention to the @entity8 that told us 33.2 million people in @entity11 and @entity12 describe themselves as @entity13			2
for if you want a more telling insight into religion in the @entity17 today , just look at these photographs			2
the story they tell is more revealing than any survey			0
the photo on the left shows @entity24 in @entity25 while the photo on the right shows worshippers gathered for friday midday prayers outside a nearby mosque in @entity31 , both in @entity32 what they show are three acts of worship performed in the @entity32 of @entity32 within a few hundred yards of each other at the end of last month			1
two of the photos show sunday morning services in the churches of @entity43 on @entity44 , and @entity24 ’s on @entity25			1
the third shows worshippers gathered for friday midday prayers outside the nearby mosque on the @entity48 in @entity31			1
the difference in numbers could hardly be more dramatic			1
at @entity43 ’s , some 12 people have congregated to celebrate @entity52			0
empty pews : 18th - century parishioners crowded into @entity43 hear @entity55			0
only 12 people attended the service when the church was built in the early 18th century , it was designed to seat 1,230			0
numbers are similar at @entity24 ’s , opened in october 1849			1
then , it could boast a congregation of 1,000			0
today , as shown in the picture , the worshippers total just 20			1
while the two churches are nearly empty , the @entity48 mosque has a different problem — overcrowding			1
the mosque itself is little more than a small room rented in a community centre , and it can hold only 100			1
however , on fridays , those numbers swell to three to four times the room ’s capacity , so the worshippers spill out onto the street , where they take up around the same amount of space as the size of the near - empty @entity24 ’s down the road			1
dwindling flock : @entity24 's @entity25 in @entity32 was built to hold 1,000 people			1
today , the congregation numbers around 20 what these pictures suggest is that , on current trends , @entity3 in this country is becoming a religion of the past , and @entity90 is one of the future			1
in the past ten years , there has been a decrease in people in @entity11 and @entity12 identifying as @entity3 , from 71.7 per cent to 59.3 per cent of the population			0
in the same period the number of @entity98 in @entity11 and @entity12 has risen from 3 per cent of the population to 4.8 per cent — 2.7 million people			0
and @entity90 has age on its side			0
whereas a half of @entity17 @entity98 are under 25 , almost a quarter of @entity13 are approaching their eighth decade			0
it is estimated that in just 20 years , there will be more active @entity98 in this country than churchgoers — an idea which even half a century ago would have been utterly unthinkable			0
many will conclude with a heavy heart that @entity3 faces a permanent decline in @entity17 , its increasingly empty churches a monument to those centuries when the teachings of @entity117 governed the thoughts and deeds of the masses			1
a study in devotion : the tiny mosque on the @entity48 , @entity31 , holds only 100 people , so the local @entity126 community throng the street for friday midday prayers on sunday october 1 , 1738 , @entity43 ’s was packed twice during the day to hear the great evangelist @entity55 , who then preached at the church for the following week explaining , as he put it , ‘ the way of salvation to many who misunderstood what had been preached concerning it ’			1
today , there are no @entity138 to fill up the pews			0
the church does its best , offering , for example , a monthly ‘ @entity145 ’ , during which the few congregants can discuss the readings of the day over a baked potato			0
@entity155 @entity154 of @entity43 ’s puts on a brave face when he says : ‘ what we are saying now is it is not just a matter of numbers			1
it is about keeping faith with the city and hanging in there — being part of the community			0
’ at @entity24 ’s , meanwhile , @entity159 can not explain why the numbers are so low : ‘ it ’s impossible to say , there are so many variables			2
’ when he is asked if he tries to boost his congregations , he simply replies : ‘ we are not a company , we are a church			0
’ in contrast , there seems a remarkable energy attached to the mosque on @entity169 , which has been described as the ‘ @entity170 ’			2
here , come rain or shine , members of the @entity126 community perform the friday prayer of @entity175 under the open sky			2
it is a communal act which will surely only grow in popularity			0
sadly , that ’s not something that can be said of the two nearby churches , and unless they can reinvigorate their congregations they may finally end up being deconsecrated			1
when that happens , such large buildings will be attractive spaces for those who can fill them			0
one day , in a few decades , @entity43 ’s may well again be packed with worshippers — but they will not be @entity13 .			2
