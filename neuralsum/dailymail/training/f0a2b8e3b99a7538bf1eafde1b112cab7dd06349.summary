by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:45 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 16:07 est , 1 august 2013 with only thin justifications , @entity3 agents have been spying on @entity5 online without a warrant - reading emails , chats and browsing histories			1
today , @entity9 broke down the process by which @entity3 analysts tap internet activity by publishing a training guide used to introduce new analysts to @entity15			1
described as the ' widest - ranging ' database , @entity15 allows analysts to wiretap basically anyone			1
@entity19 was referring to the system when he said in june : ‘ i , sitting at my desk can wiretap anyone , from you or your accountant , to a federal judge or even the president , if i had a personal email			0
’ how they did it : new documents published in @entity9 today show how @entity3 analysts like @entity19 spied on @entity5 without a warrant massive reach : @entity15 is a program involving over 700 servers worldwide that supposedly hold basically everything that every casual user does on the internet the manual explained in detail how analysts could side - step warrants and spy on ‘ nearly everything a typical user does on the internet ’ – including the web activity of @entity5			1
these revelations come in light of a congressional hearing taking place today which representative @entity53 said would be ‘ an ad hoc , bipartisan hearing on domestic surveillance			2
’ senior intelligence officials from the @entity58 , @entity3 , @entity59 , and the @entity60 , as well as critics , will be speaking about the surveillance program			1
hearing : the @entity63 is holding a hearing today on the surveillance programs carried out by the @entity3 legally , the @entity3 is not allowed to spy on @entity5 persons without a @entity68 warrant			1
but @entity15 provides a loophole for this law			0
if an @entity5 had contact with a foreign target , that allows the @entity3 to track them without a warrant			1
analysts just provide a justification for the tapping , usually from several excuses , some included in a drop - drown menu , and they can start surveillance			2
no court official or @entity3 official signed off on the individual justifications			0
' it 's very rare to be questioned on our searches , ’ @entity19 said in june			0
‘ and even when we are it 's usually along the lines of : let 's bulk up the justification ' the @entity3 denies this claim , issuing a statement to the newspaper today that there are ‘ multiple technical , manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring			1
’ and once tapped , the type of information searchable is startling			0
all they need is simple information such as an email , ip address or phone number to access web activity			0
manual : an excerpt from the @entity15 training guide shows how simple log - in information allows analysts to access a wide - range of information online by entering a person ’s email and a justification , an analyst can read all email exchanges , narrowing down by time range			1
justification : analysts can read personal email exchanges with an address and a simple ' justification ' for the surveillance analysts could also read chats and private message on social - networking site @entity131 simply by entering the target ’s username and a date range			2
they could perform reverse searches as well , entering a specific website and gaining information on all the ip addresses that visited it			0
the sheer amount of information being collected online is so large that most information can only be stored for three to five days			2
to store ‘ interesting data ’ for longer , the agency built a database that can hold some documents for as long as five years			0
according to an @entity3 report published in 2007 , 850billion ‘ call events ’ had been collected and stored , and about 150billion internet records			2
they reported that each day 1 - 2billion new records were added			2
in 2012 , there were 41billion total records in the @entity15 system for one 30 - day period			1
while the agency has tried to keep @entity5 communications separate from foreign communications , they have admitted that even strictly @entity5 communications can travel on foreign systems and it ’s sometimes hard to identify the national origin of of a communication			0
domestic surveillance : drop - down menus give analysts several justifications to monitor @entity5 based on a foreign target connection in their statement , the @entity3 continued to defend their broad surveillance : ‘ these types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to protect @entity5 and allied troops abroad			1
’ wide - ranging : @entity15 allowed analysts access to ' nearly everything a typical user does on the internet ' hoping to stop some of the opposition in congress to domestic surveillance , the @entity183 administration announced today that it will declassify a set of documents on its telephone spying program			1
the documents will provide little solace , however , to @entity5 hoping to understand the legal analysis that underpinned the widespread surveillance			2
and the redacted documents show only in broad strokes how @entity3 officials use the data			0
one particular type of analysis , called " hop analysis " is hinted at but never fully discussed			0
that allows the government to search the phone records of not only suspected terrorists , but everyone who called them , everyone who called those people , and others who called them , as well			0
with that authority , the government can search the records of millions of people in an investigation of one person .			0

training manuals on the @entity3 's web spying system were released today
@entity15 , the system used to mine information online , is described by the @entity3 as their ' widest - reaching ' database
the manual explains how analysts were able to spy on @entity5 without a warrant
for 2012 , the database had 41billion records stored during a single 30 - day period
the @entity231 is having a hearing on the surveillance program today
@entity235 will declassify documents on its telephone spying program
