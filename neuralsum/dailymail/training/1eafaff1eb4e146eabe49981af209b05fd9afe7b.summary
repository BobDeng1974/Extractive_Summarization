@entity0 looked in danger of missing out on @entity11 ’s top race when @entity12 requested he was replaced on the filly owned by his boss sheik @entity14 by veteran @entity16 , the jockey on board when she won the @entity18			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) has chosen to ride @entity2 ( pictured ) in sunday 's @entity19 since then @entity6 has registered her third defeat of the season in the @entity22 with @entity0 suggesting the 2014 model is a pale shadow of the 2013 one			1
but @entity26 - @entity7 , who has expressed satisfaction with @entity6 ’s preparation , told @entity29 : ‘ we will prove on sunday he ( @entity0 ) is wrong			1
‘ i do n’t think she has gone mentally			0
she sweated before the @entity22 but then she did that before the @entity18 last year			0
‘ mentally she is still strong , less so physically after her foot and back problems this year			0
i would n’t run her unless i thought she was mentally up for the challenge			0

conditions of his recent part - purchase mean @entity0 , successful on his boss ’s impressive debutant @entity70 at @entity71 , is also unable to ride @entity73 ’s third runner @entity72 , with @entity74 maintaining his partnership with the @entity77 winner			2
both @entity78 and @entity6 are shorter in the @entity18 betting than @entity2 but @entity79 , racing manager for @entity73 , said the colt ’s chances should not be underestimated			2
