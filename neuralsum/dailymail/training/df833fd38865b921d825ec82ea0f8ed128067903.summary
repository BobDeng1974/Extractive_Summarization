walkout : a group of employees at the @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , are said to have left the restaurant in quick succession in protest at @entity4 's ( right ) ' bossy management style ' the famous chef bought the pub in 2011 , but locals quickly became ' upset ' with the changes he made , and some shunned it for being too pricey			1
customers who have booked rooms are apprently being sent to a nearby hotel and tables ca n’t be reserve - but a spokesman for the venue claimed the restaurant is only shut for a quick refurbishment			1
local councillor @entity41 , who has been drinking at the pub for more than 20 years , said around 15 members of staff walked out in the past few weeks			1
he said : ' it has been a down hill struggle since he [ @entity41 ] took over to be honest			0
he has gone through about eight or nine chefs in the last year			1
' it is because they are not allowed to run the how they think it should be run			0
but the final straw came two or three weeks ago and most of the staff resigned en masse , basically because he would n’t let them manage			1
' i understand the chef that was there left yesterday			1
he took most of the staff with him			1
i walked up there today and i said to the manager ‘ what the hell is going on ? ’ ' he ’s a great guy but he ’s there by himself			1
he said ‘ well , i put my notice in and i ’m leaving in two weeks time ’			2
there is nobody there to run the place			0
' when i was up there there was a @entity74 couple there			0
he was there trying to explain " we ca n’t take you because we ’ve got no staff "			2
' a member of the kitchen staff who left the pub two years ago , but worked under ‘ @entity4 ’s reign ’ said there have always been problems			1
he told @entity86 : ‘ by the end of my time there , it was a horrible place to work			0
‘ it was always up and down			0
when he first turned up it was really good , but after the novelty wore off it just dropped			0
the standards were n’t great			0
‘ the head chef that was brought in and was having to train someone new every week because of the turnover of staff			1
it just did n’t go well at all			0

@entity4 bought the pear tree in march 2011 with business partner @entity102 as one of six pubs from @entity105 which went into administration			1

allegations : the venue - which was bought by the chef in 2011 - has allegedly been forced to turn away customers as ' only one manager remains ' - but staff claim it is just because of refurbishments reaction : residents in the @entity13 village ' shunned ' @entity4 's ' posh ' food when he took the venue over in 2011 all pub snacks were removed with customers being pointed towards the ' posh ' menu for food , and one of the eight rooms at the hotel cost between £ 70 and £ 170 a night			1

mr @entity41 added : ' @entity41 does n’t realise what ’s going on			0
he lives in a bit of a dream world			0
and he wo n’t let the staff manage			2
' the staff know what the locals want but @entity41 wo n’t let them			1
i ’ve heard the place is losing £ 2,000 a week - that ’s just the rumours though			0
' but manager @entity153 denied the place had lost its staff , defended his boss , and said customers were only being turned away because of a refurbishment			1
he also said some younger members of staff had left to go to university			2
mr @entity153 said : ' i ’ve got a lot of respect for @entity41 , so it ’s not my place to really say anything			0
i am leaving but i ’m going on to my own career , i just want to take on something by myself - that ’s the only reason behind me doing it			0
response : the manager has denied the claims - and says they have a ' full brigade ' working at the restaurant and said the head chef had moved on because he was offered another job @entity178 : the venue in @entity12 , @entity13 , has a bar , restaurant and eight en - suite rooms ' i ’ve been working for @entity41 for coming on five years , which is a long time at one place , and i want to take on my own thing			1
' he denied the staff has resigned en masse , or that he was the only staff member left , and added : ' we ’ve at full brigade here			2
' yes the head chef has moved on , but that has been happening for some time really , we ’ve been expecting it for a while			1
' he is a very talented chef and he got offered a job in a restaurant where he can write his own menu			2
