by @entity0 published : 21:06 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 21:20 est , 5 december 2013 families who build ‘ granny flats ’ for elderly relatives or house grown - up children in converted garages are to be given a lucrative tax break			2
from april , tens of thousands of households who have an annexe lived in by a family member will get a 50 per cent discount off their current council tax bill			1
at present , these self - contained buildings are classed as individual properties so homeowners pay a full rate of council tax on them – on top of what they pay for their own residence			1
reforms : from april , tens of thousands of households who have an annexe lived in by a family member will get a 50 per cent discount off their current council tax bill ( file picture ) currently a typical home would have a council tax of £ 2,427 for both properties , but the tax break is expected to knock £ 500 a year off this			1
there are an estimated 24,150 family annexes in @entity37 , plus many more in @entity38 and @entity39			1
the government hopes that by giving such granny flats a tax break it will encourage more families to build them and help elderly relatives and older children to live independently			2
it is also expected to give a huge boost to the construction industry			0
@entity49 , of over- @entity50 , said : ‘ it ’s great to see that the double taxation faced by families that want to house family members has been addressed			2
‘ a 50 per cent council tax discount on an annexe could encourage more families to have a ‘ ‘ granny flat ’ ’ for older relatives so that they can remain independent , whilst still being close enough in case help is needed			1
‘ it could also offer a cost - effective alternative for grown - up children whilst they save for a deposit to get their foot on the property ladder			0
’ the taxman is to increase its use of debt collectors to target households that refuse to pay their bills			0
in a drive to claw back £ 2.3billion from tax fraud , errors and debts , the chancellor revealed the government would use more private sector agencies with ‘ specialist recovery skills ’			1
although they will not be able to call at people ’s homes , they will be allowed to write letters , phone and send texts and emails			0
the debt agencies will be paid by results			0
in most cases , the targets are families who were overpaid tax credits after failing to tell @entity96 about a change in circumstances			2
a blitz on tax avoidance and fraud is set to raise £ 9billion over the next five years , the chancellor said			1
@entity103 unveiled a crackdown on aggressive tax dodging schemes , saying it was unacceptable for firms or individuals to ‘ avoid paying their fair share ’			2
hedge funds and other partnerships will have to pay another £ 2.2billion in tax , as he announced an end to murky arrangements whereby fund managers are treated as self - employed and avoid paying @entity117			1
they will also be stopped from delaying income tax payments to earn interest			2
@entity122 officials will also get better systems to help them claw back £ 2.3bn paid out in benefits and tax credits because of fraud and error			1
the double council tax bill has been dubbed a penalty for families because it particularly affects generations who want to live together			1
for a local authority to class an annexe as a separate property it must usually be self - contained and constructed or adapted for use as separate living accommodation			0
it will usually include a kitchen area , a bathroom or shower - room and toilet			0
tens of thousands of expats who claim the state pension will have to prove they are still alive			2
every two years , many @entity147 who live overseas will be obliged to get a certificate signed by their doctor , a lawyer or a government official if they want to keep claiming state payouts			0
it is thought up to 500,000 expats living in countries that do not automatically share information with the @entity147 may be affected			0
the new rules are to crack down on the number of people who continue to pocket a pension for a partner who has died			0
the fraud is estimated to cost the taxpayer up to £ 25million a year			1
the typical council tax bill for a band @entity166 home in @entity37 is £ 1,456			1
on top of this an annexe , which would be classed as band a , would incur a bill of £ 971			1
families will now get a 50 per cent discount off this second tax , which will save them a total of £ 5.3million in 2014/15			1
the plans do not go as far as when they were first mooted by communities minister @entity178 last year			0
at that time the government suggested it could axe council tax completely on such annexes			1
there is already an exemption from council tax for annexes lived in by relatives who are classed as dependent – such as frail older relatives or the disabled			1
but the new rules will particularly help relatives who want to live independently and annexes used by any other family members			2
it will not apply if the annexe is lived in by someone who is not family			2
a levy on self - built homes , including all extensions and home improvements will also be lifted			0
@entity202 , of my ageing parent which advises families how to care for older relatives , said : ‘ everyone can benefit from this			0
‘ it could make life much easier for thousands of families who are forced to travel hundreds of miles to look after elderly relatives and end up feeling guilty they do n’t see them enough			0
‘ at the same time it allows elderly people to live independently			0
’ but @entity218 - @entity217 , of the @entity219 , suggested the proposals were not sufficient in helping elderly people			0
he said : ‘ putting a shed on the side of the house is not the long - term answer to solving the housing issues for older people .			0

changes will see a *dramatic* cut in tax bill for thousands from next april
a typical home has a council tax of £ 2,427 for both properties
there are an estimated 24,150 family annexes in @entity37 , plus many more in @entity38 and @entity39
