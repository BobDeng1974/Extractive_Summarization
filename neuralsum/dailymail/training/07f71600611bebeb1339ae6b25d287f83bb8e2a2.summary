@entity39 heard that , despite complaints , there was a management ‘ cover - up ’ at @entity45 , in @entity22 , and the abuse was allowed to continue			1

‘ the decision to put my dad into care was one we did n’t take lightly , ’ he said			0
‘ as a family we were left with feelings of guilt			0
the defendants all worked the day shift on the @entity87 at the home , which housed residents diagnosed with dementia and displaying ' challenging behaviour ' , the court heard			1
@entity92 , prosecuting , told the court the four defendants ill - treated residents in ' varying ways '			1
' they mocked them , bullied them and on occasions deliberately assaulted them , ' she said			2
miss @entity92 said bean bags should have been used as part of recreational therapy but they were thrown so hard and fast that residents were unable to catch them			1
' this caused frustration and anger in the residents , whereas the defendants would laugh , ' she said			2
@entity57 and @entity23 would say ' they were doing it for their entertainment as they were bored ' and if residents objected , they ' would be subjected to it all the more '			1

‘ victims of dementia are extremely vulnerable and susceptible to others			2
their quality of daily life is dependent on the help of others			0

one son of a victim chose to enter the witness box to give his statement in person			2
@entity238 said his family ’s decision to place his father , @entity74 , a retired chartered surveyor , into care was the ' worst day of our lives '			0
he said that decision was not taken lightly because his father , married for 57 years , had @entity11 ’s and was unable to give his opinion			0
he said : ' we had feelings of guilt for not being able to look after him			0
' our feelings of guilt only worsened when we found out that @entity252 had been subjected to humiliation and ill - treatment by those who were trusted to care for him			1
' we feel angry this could have been allowed to happen to @entity252 and sorry that @entity257 had to learn about it			0
” he said evidence heard at the trial had ' saddened us greatly '			2
mr @entity238 said a clear signal had to be sent by the courts that such behaviour could not be tolerated			0
he asked : ' what sort of human being treats another with such disrepect ? ' he added that he thought it was clear that management at @entity65 had covered up the incidents and that they and the owners had failed to ensure the safety of the residents			1
mr @entity238 said he did not believe the @entity274 ( @entity48 ) had held @entity275 to account			0
he said he was still awaiting formal apologies from the defendants and @entity279 ’s management and directors			0

a daughter of one victim said she was ' devastated ' when she was informed of the abuse			2

another relative described how she was informed of the abuse against her mother			2
' to receive a letter and to be informed that your parent has possibly been physically abused in a place that is thought to be comfortable for them is heartbreaking , ' she said			0
she said she wanted to know why the defendants had acted like they did and what they would think if their parents were treated in the same manner			0
the son of the man whose foot was stamped on also thanked whistleblowers in the case who were ' brave enough ' to come forward			0
the wife of another victim described feeling that members of staff had been ' laughing at the families behind their backs ' and that the carers had abused her trust			0
judge @entity6 said three common themes emerged from the statements given by families			0
he said : ' in each and every case , the victim ’s family trusted the home to look after their relative			2
' secondly , many of the families felt a sense of guilt of having to give up the care of one of their family to be cared for by strangers			0
' and thirdly , the anger and resentment at the trust being betrayed			0
