@entity1 defender @entity0 is confident he will never forget his maiden @entity2 away match			1
@entity4 has experienced plenty of firsts in 2014 as his rapid rise to prominence continues , including starting a @entity10 game early in the year and later going on to make his senior @entity12 debut			1
the 20 - year - old is now getting a taste of a continental campaign with his club in what is their return to @entity2 action after four seasons of not being involved			1
@entity0 featured in his first @entity2 away match in a hard fought 1 - 1 draw against @entity24 the 20 - year - old has had a stellar year , making his @entity12 debut on 30 may in a 3 - 0 win against @entity27 another milestone was @entity4 ' first @entity12 start in a friendly against @entity31 on 3 september and his latest new experience came on thursday night as the @entity1 played their first away fixture of @entity35 with the opponents being @entity38 's @entity24 , the contest very much represented a journey into the unknown , even given the help @entity1 striker @entity41 and winger @entity42 - both of whom have played in the country 's premier division - tried to provide for their team - mates in the preparations			1
it turned out to be an extremely tricky fixture for the @entity49 from which they just salvaged a 1 - 1 draw , their stand - out seasoned @entity2 campaigner @entity41 notching an equaliser in the 82nd minute			1
1 january 2014 - @entity4 makes his first @entity10 start in a 1 - 1 draw against @entity56			2

2 october 2014 - another first for the @entity1 man as he features in his maiden @entity2 away game in a 1 - 1 draw against @entity24			1
and reflecting upon the evening , @entity0 said : ' it is a big learning curve for me and one of these nights - you 'll never forget the first one			1
' it was hard - we do n't get to see much of the @entity38 league , so we did our homework on them and got advice off @entity41 and @entity80 as much as we could			2
' but you never really know until you get here and play them			0
it was pretty much a learning curve for us all			1
' it is always hard when you are coming away to a such a hostile environment like here i suppose			0
' it was very strange for us , something we are not used to			0
' @entity1 were second - best for much of the game and fell behind in the 43rd minute when @entity91 capitalised on an error by @entity93 and fired home			0
@entity24 created the bulk of the chances throughout and almost made it 2 - 0 in the second half when substitute @entity98 hit the bar			0
although there were a number of moments of uncertainty at the back for the visitors , @entity4 put in a fairly impressive individual display			0
and he felt the team showed great character to snatch a 1 - 1 draw late on for a second successive match , having done the same in saturday 's @entity114 derby at @entity115 stones reflected on a ' hard ' test against @entity24 who finished fifth in the @entity119 last year veteran striker @entity41 wheels away after his late leveller for @entity1 at the @entity123 it was a tricky affair , but @entity126 's men held on to snatch a @entity35 draw in @entity38 stones said : ' i think it is a very good point that we got out of the game			2
' it was a bit sloppy for the first goal , but i thought the character we showed to come back and score the equaliser was credit to ourselves			0
' we dug in there and i thought we could even have had a few more			0
' it shows there is great character in the dressing room			0

stones ' rapid rise to prominence has continued to impress
