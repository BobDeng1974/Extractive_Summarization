by @entity0 many people would think expecting to have both brains and beauty would be wishful thinking			2
not so one @entity6 member who says having a nose job was the cleverest thing he has ever done			1
@entity9 , 21 , from @entity10 , had cosmetic surgery before graduating to make sure his large nose did n’t stop him being offered a job			1
@entity9 , 21 , from @entity10 , had a nose job because his large nose was damaging his self - confidence			1
he is pictured ( left ) before the operation and ( right ) after it now he says that thanks to the operation his confidence is finally as high as his iq			1
mr @entity9 , who has an iq of 132 , said : ‘ it was a no brainer for me			1
i wanted to enter the job market at my best and i could n’t be that with confidence issues about my appearance			1
‘ i hated meeting new people or having photographs taken			2
i shied back from the spotlight			0
‘ but now i ’m confident and ready to tackle anything			0
it ’s simple logic , feeling less ugly has made me braver and happier			0
it ’s nice not to be laughed at because of my nose			2
’ mr @entity9 first started dreaming of cosmetic surgery as a self - conscious teenager			1
he said : ‘ i inherited a large bump in my nose which runs in the family			1
mr @entity9 ( pictured on his graduation day after his operation ) says he feared his large nose would prevent him being offered a job			1
he says having the surgery also made him confident in his graduation photos mr @entity9 says having the surgery was the best thing he has ever done			1
he is pictured after the operation ‘ i tried to just forget about it and get on with things because we all know there are more important things to life , but it did cause me embarrassment and make me feel self - conscious			0
’ despite being bullied over his appearance he still passed 11 gcses with flying colours and won a place to study a-levels at college			2
he also went on to read for a degree at @entity60			0
he said : ‘ my confidence grew slightly but i still hated talking to people side on and despised having my photograph taken			2
mr @entity9 ( pictured after the operation ) is a member of @entity6 with an iq of 132 ‘ i never felt particularly attractive so i suppose because of that i was n’t the most outgoing or dynamic person in the room			1
’ so he focused on his studies and was thrilled to win membership to the prestigious @entity6 academy in 2012 with an iq of 132 - 132 is the @entity72 pass mark for joining @entity6			0
but despite his top credentials as he neared the end of his degree in media and marketing , he feared his nose would hold him back as he competed for jobs in a difficult market			1
he said : ‘ you do n’t have to be a genius to work out that in the current job market only the very best will win the few jobs available			2
‘ i felt sure that could n’t be me because i simply was n’t the best i could be because of my confidence			2
‘ it ’s a complete myth that only shallow or stupid people care about the way they look			0
it ’s not shallow to want to make the best of yourself			0
’ he began researching surgeons and within a month of finishing his degree in may 2013 was on the operating table at @entity96 in @entity97			0
he said : ‘ i researched the companies thoroughly and all claimed to have the best surgeons , something i would expect from a surgery provider anyway			2
but transform seemed to offer the best after care and support			0
’ the surgeon agreed to shave off the bump and smooth the tip for a more streamlined nose at a cost of £ 4,000			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ it was a lot of money but i saw it as an investment in myself and my future			1
’ he was instantly delighted with the results			0
he said : ‘ even with the bandages on i could see a huge difference			0
i knew it would only improve as the swelling receded			0
mr @entity9 , pictured ( left ) before the surgery and ( right ) after it , said : ' now i ’m confident and ready to tackle anything			1
it ’s simple logic , feeling less ugly has made me braver and happier ' mr @entity9 ( pictured on his graduation day after his surgery ) says he is now confident entering the jobs market and feels his chance is as good as anyone else 's ‘ when the bandages came off i just looked at my side profile and thought : ‘ @entity134 , i ’m not really ugly anymore			1
’ as he recovered he was thrilled to hear he ’d won a job on a graduate training scheme that he ’d applied for before the surgery , but says his new nose meant he was able to start the position in august 2013 full of enthusiasm and vigour			1
and months later when he graduated in november 2013 he enjoyed posing for pictures in his gown			0
he said : ‘ i hated cameras before and would never have posed for photographs			0
it was wonderful to enjoy it			0
’ now his graduate scheme is coming to an end and mr @entity9 says he ’s confident enough to face battling for another job thanks to his nose			1
he said : ‘ everyone knows how tough it is for graduates to find work right now			0
i ’m so pleased i made the decision to have surgery with transform because now my chances are just as good as the next mans			2
