for a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country , the sudden opening of a gun store on @entity3 's @entity2 raised eyebrows			1
the @entity8 was open for only two days last week and had a very specific purpose - to put people off buying guns			1
potential shoppers were lured in by a large sign in the window that stated : ' first - time gun buyer ? we are here to help you			0
' in the apparently well - stocked store , in a space usually used as an art gallery , each gun is labelled with information about how that make and model was used in a particular tragedy			1
the ' sales pitches ' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal and hidden cameras captured the startled reactions of customers			1
@entity51 's mom had this in her collection , too , until he took this and several other guns and killed her and then went down to @entity56 and killed six teachers and 20 innocent children			1
twenty little kids â€¦ gone like that			0
' for a customer interested in ease of use he said : ' this revolver , it 's the easiest gun we have to use			0
it 's our most popular one			0
it 's a .22 - caliber , six - inch revolver			0
it 's also a gun that a five - year - old found in his parents ' bedroom , went down and shot his nine - month - old baby brother with it			0
' in another part of the video he showed a 9mm semi-automatic weapon to a customer : ' a very handy gun			0
it 's a great gun to carry in your purse , like that gal from the @entity90 , her two - year - old son reaches into her pocketbook , pulls it out , shoots her			0
' the store - and its accompanying website , @entity92 - were part of a campaign put together by @entity96 to @entity97 , a gun control non-profit organization and @entity3 @entity98 , one of their affiliates			1
the ' sales pitches ' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal descriptions of tragedies committed with the make and model of the weapon all the weapons , which were unloaded movie props , also have a tag with information about the tragedy to which the clerk refers - the descriptions are also on the related website hidden cameras captured the reactions of potential first - time gun owners to the ' sales pitches ' customers were visibly shocked or upset by the descriptions of gun accidents and mass shootings working with @entity125 , a @entity3 - base agency , and production company @entity127 , the goal was to ensure that people are aware of how many accidents and tragedies occur as a result of having a gun in a home			1
the groups were also particularly keen to reach out to parents			0
the pro-gun lobby was quick to label the stunt as misleading			2
' this is a tasteless pr stunt designed to further an anti-gun agenda , and it 's out of touch with reality , ' @entity139 spokeswoman @entity138 told @entity145			1
' as gun ownership has risen to an all - time high , violent crime has fallen to a 43 - year low , and the firearm accident death rate has fallen to the lowest that it has been in over a hundred years			2
' ' a clear majority of the @entity152 people support the use of firearms for protection and put more faith in gun ownership rights than in gun control			2
' @entity159 , executive director of @entity160 said : ' our aim is to ensure those looking to purchase a firearm are aware of the potential risks [ and to promote responsible gun ownership ]			2
' ' often gun purchasers wrongly believe guns will keep them safe when , in fact , a gun in the home greatly increases the risk of homicide and suicide			2
' ' this sets the record straight so consumers can make an informed choice to buy a firearm or not			1
' the store has an accompanying website which carries the same information potential shoppers found the information sobering			0
