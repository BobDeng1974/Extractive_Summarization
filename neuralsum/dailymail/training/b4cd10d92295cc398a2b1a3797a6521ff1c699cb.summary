three experimental treatments will be used on @entity2 patients in @entity3 from next month as health workers attempt to bring the viral outbreak under control			2
at one site in @entity9 victims will be given blood transfusions from recovered patients , while at two different locations medics will begin using new antiviral drugs			1
all three treatments have been fast - tracked into use without the usual lengthy trials on animals and healthy people , but doctors believe it is the only way of stopping the infection spreading further			1
blood plasma therapy , in which the blood of an @entity2 survivor is pumped into a sufferer to boost their immune system , has been used before but the precise effects have not been studied			1
medics will begin treating @entity2 patients in @entity3 using blood transfusions and two new types of antiviral drugs at three different sites from next month the treatments have been fast - tracked into use without the lengthy trials on humans and animals , but medics insist they are needed to bring the deadly outbreak under control doctor @entity44 , who caught the virus in @entity9 before carrying it back to @entity47 , was given blood from nurse @entity49 while in isolation at a hospital in the city			1
@entity54 nurse @entity53 was also given a blood transfusion after she caught the virus treating two missionaries			1
both patients have recovered and been released from hospital after testing negative for @entity2			2
doctors from the @entity62 of @entity63 will begin the first widespread trial of blood plasma therapy at an ebola centre in @entity67 , @entity9 , next month			1
the first antiviral drug , known as brincidofovir , is being tested by @entity70 at a separate site in @entity72 , though researchers have not revealed exactly where			2
the drug comes in tablet form and needs to be taken twice a week for two weeks			0
the drug works by interfering with the way the virus multiplies within healthy human cells			0
it will be given to 140 patients , with their consent , and doctors will compare their survival rates against those who were not treated			0
@entity85 , who is overseeing the trial of the drug , said : ' if we 're going to find a treatment , we have to do it now - which is why we have to accelerate these trials			0
' a second antiviral , favipiravir , will be administered at a third site in @entity9			0
mrs @entity53 was also thought to have been given this drug before recovering from @entity2 , but authorities would not confirm its use			0
transfusions involve pumping blood from a recovered @entity2 patient into a sick person			1
the treatment has been used before , such as on @entity47 doctor @entity44 ( pictured ) but has not been widely tested while there is evidence that blood transfusions are effective , their use is highly controversial among native @entity109 , many of whom hold to spiritual beliefs while it is hoped that the new treatments will help to stop the largest and deadliest outbreak of @entity2 in history , their success is far from certain			1
the antiviral drugs are largely untested on humans , so it is not known exactly what effect they will have on the virus			1
while there is some anecdotal evidence that blood transfusions can help patients recover , their use is highly controversial among the native @entity3 people			1
identifying people who have recovered from the disease , taking their blood , transporting it to the patient and then administering it in countries whose healthcare systems have been wiped out also poses huge challenges			2
the worst outbreak of the virus on record has claimed at least 5,160 lives in @entity72 , @entity141 and @entity9 so far			0
cases of the disease have also been reported in @entity144 , where eight people have died , and @entity146 , where four have been killed			0
a team from @entity70 will test one antiviral , known as brincidofovir , which works by disrupting the way the ebola virus divides inside human cells a team from @entity154 will test one of the antivirals , known as brincidofovir , which works by disrupting the way the ebola virus divides inside human cells officials in @entity146 believed they had eradicated the disease after quarantining everyone who had come into contact with a two - year - old girl who arrived from @entity9 carrying the disease			2
however a second infected man arrived and passed the disease to a nurse , who died on tuesday , prompting 90 more people to be placed in isolation			0
the country 's president , @entity170 , says he has no plans to close the border with @entity9 for the moment , but has called on the @entity175 to step up their response to the crisis .			0

doctors will test blood transfusion therapy and two new antiviral drugs
none of the treatments have been put through usual lengthy testing
blood transfusions used before but no widespread trial has taken place
@entity47 patient dr @entity44 was given transfusion during recovery
