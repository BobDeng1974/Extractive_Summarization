by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 20:45 est , 14 june 2013 @entity2 frustration with the @entity4 ’s outspoken opposition to spending cuts boiled over yesterday , as a senior minister ridiculed the department for having ‘ more horses than tanks ’			1
treasury chief secretary @entity10 made the jibe after senior generals joined defence secretary @entity13 in warning that further cuts would damage the @entity15			1
general sir @entity16 , the head of the @entity17 , told @entity18 that further spending reductions could prove ‘ quite dangerous , quite soon ’			0
he added : ‘ we have got to the point in certain areas where we ca n’t go any further without seriously damaging our professional competence and our chances of success on future battlefields			0
’ battle : the @entity29 military has more than 500 horses but fewer than 230 tanks , treasury minister @entity10 noted as he insisted the @entity4 had ' plenty of room ' to make savings mr @entity10 , who is charged with finding £ 11.5billion in cuts for the year 2015 - 16 , responded by saying : ‘ of course in a department that has more horses than it has tanks , there is room for efficiency savings without affecting our overall military output , which is what we need to maintain			1
’ official figures show the @entity4 has more than 500 horses , including 417 on ceremonial duties and 82 held by the @entity48			1
the @entity49 also keep two ponies as mascots			0
by contrast , cuts following the last strategic defence and security review have left the @entity17 with only 227 @entity57 tanks			1
however , a defence source said mr @entity10 ’s claim was meaningless , as reducing the number of horses retained for ceremonial duties like @entity63 would have virtually no impact on the department ’s finances			1
cuts : chief secretary to the treasury @entity10 praised the 13 departments who have settled their savings for 2015 - 16 they said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s a very helpful contribution			1
horses play a proud ceremonial role in the @entity15 , and modern warfare is not based on tanks			1
’ the row came as @entity79 sought to calm @entity81 fears about military cuts by confirming there would be no further reduction in military personnel			1
under current plans the size of the @entity17 will be slashed from 102,000 three years ago to 82,000 by 2015			2
there had been fears that the number could be cut again			0
but speaking at a @entity91 press conference , mr @entity79 said : ‘ we are not going to be making further cuts to the numbers of our @entity17 , @entity95 or @entity96			2
‘ they know what they have available and i think we can be very proud of the job that they do			0
‘ no department can be excluded from being efficient , from saving money , from making sure we get the best possible value for every pound that we take from the taxpayers and spend			0
‘ but our taxpayers and our country can be secure in the knowledge that we have the fourth - largest [ defence ] budget in the world and we have some of the finest armed forces in the world and while i ’m prime minister that is the way it will always stay			2
’ @entity118 ’s @entity2 spokesman @entity117 said it was astonishing that ministers were fighting their spending battles in public , adding : ‘ it ’s totally chaotic for the government to be conducting spending negotiations in public this way , with big departments like defence yet to reach agreement			1
’ but mr @entity10 said : ‘ although none of the spending choices we make are easy , ensuring the @entity29 can pay its way in the world is vital to our long - term prosperity			1
’ military horses have a unique role in both the history and day - to - day life of the @entity29 army			1
as many as 100 mounted officers used to help guard the monarch , accompanying them on any trip they made by road			2
now the @entity4 has more than 500 horses			2
the daily @entity146 ceremony involves up to 15 horses if the @entity148 is in @entity149 and 12 if she is away			2
the @entity151 sentries and their mounts are on duty every day outside @entity154 , offering round - the - clock protection to the royal household			0
today ’s popular @entity63 ceremony also has the @entity29 cavalry at its heart			0
the procession , which marks the official birthday of the @entity162 , takes place every year in june on @entity164			0
it has been a @entity29 infantry tradition since 1748			0
more than 200 of the @entity17 ’s horses line the route , forming the body of the parade and pulling the @entity148 ’s coach			0
the event has become so popular with spectators that tickets regularly sell @entity174 even gather to watch the rehearsals that take place two weeks before .			0

chief secretary to the treasury argues cuts can be made without hitting the *frontline*
another 6 government departments have *signed* off 2015 - 16 budgets
but with half of *ministries* settled only a third of £ 11.5bn has been found
