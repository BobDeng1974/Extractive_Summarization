@entity0 will not be allowed to sign players in 2015 after the @entity2 upheld the @entity4 sanction imposed on the @entity6 club			1
the ban was imposed on @entity0 after they were deemed to have breached rules on signing international players under the age of 18			1
@entity0 were appealing the ban at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , this week but it was confirmed on tuesday morning that it has been upheld and the @entity6 will also be fined 450,000 @entity15 ( Â£ 293,000 )			1
@entity17 's move to @entity0 was allowed while the club appealed against a ban on new signings , which is now in force after @entity4 's original sanction was upheld by the @entity2 on tuesday @entity23 is one of five players to have moved to the @entity25 this summer although they can not make new signings they can renew contracts and recall on - loan players			1
@entity0 were not happy with the decision and released a statement blasting @entity2			2
' @entity0 wishes to state , with all due respect for the sports authorities , that it totally disagrees with the verdict of the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) announced today to confirm the sanction originally imposed by @entity4 as a consequence of the alleged breach of regulations on the international transfer of minor footballers			1
' the club has made it clear to the @entity42 , the @entity43 and the @entity2 itself that it understands and supports the policy on the protection of minors and the concern for the protection of their development and education			0
' this is confirmed by how they club has acted throughout its history , setting an example around the world for the way its young footballers are schooled and educated , and the work that is done on their development			0
@entity0 's youth structure has enabled hundreds of young players to achieve their dreams and receive a decent upbringing			2
@entity69 has also moved to @entity0 after their ban was delayed , but it is now in full force ' the errors that the club might have committed , and which have been recognised and argued before the corresponding authorities are , in all cases , of an administrative nature and to a large extent have been caused by the existing conflict between the @entity4 regulations and @entity83 legislation , along with the @entity85 's conviction that it was acting correctly			1
' therefore , @entity0 considers the sanction to be completely disproportionate as it supposes an excessive punishment for the club , when considering its trajectory and the circumstances of this specific case			0
' @entity2 had earlier released a statement saying : ' @entity2 has dismissed the appeal filed by @entity0 against @entity4 regarding the decision issued by the @entity94 on august 19 , 2014			1
@entity17 is introduced to @entity0 fans in august after making his summer move from @entity97 ' the panel found in particular that @entity0 had breached the rules regarding the protection of minors and the registration of minors attending football academies			2
' the @entity4 decision is confirmed in full and the sanction remains in force			0
' @entity0 's appeal to @entity2 forced a delay of the initial ban and allowed them to sign @entity17 , @entity69 and @entity23 among others during the last summer transfer window			1
but the @entity2 decision means the suspension will now be in effect during the january window and the summer spending period			0
@entity0 will only be allowed to add to their squad from january 2016			0
the @entity120 ( @entity120 ) issued a statement later on tuesday in which it expressed its concern that other @entity83 clubs could find themselves in the same situation , and saying it may take the case to the @entity128			0
it also backed @entity0 's insistence that they had acted correctly throughout , and labelled the club 's @entity131 youth academy as ' a world example '			0
' we consider that the sanction can only be classified as totally disproportionate , inappropriate and unrelated to the errors , since it involves a disproportionate punishment for @entity0 , taking into account the behaviour and the circumstances of the case , ' a statement on www.lfp.es read			0
' as a result of this existing conflict , to properly protect the interests of under - age players , the current model of @entity83 football and the because other @entity83 clubs can be found in a similar situation , the @entity120 is conducting a review of the adequacy of the different rules of @entity4 , as well as the different standards of the @entity128 , and based on this will consider the possibility of reporting to the @entity128 the current regulation of the transfer of under - age players			2
