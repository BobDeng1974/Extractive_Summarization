the @entity0 was a brief moment of humanity amid the horrors of the @entity3			2
but when @entity6 and @entity8 troops emerged from the trenches to shake hands and swap gifts in @entity12 , the festive goodwill clearly did not extend to the @entity13 , a newly discovered letter reveals			1
lance corporal @entity14 tells how a shared contempt for @entity18 ’s @entity17 ally in the @entity3 helped the opposing sides briefly find common ground when they met , with one @entity8 officer even remarking : ‘ ten @entity13 do n’t make an @entity22			1

one of the @entity8 was an officer who shook hands , then asked in @entity22 : ‘ are you all @entity22 in front there , and no @entity13 ? ’ lance corporal @entity14 wrote : ‘ i answered , “ all @entity22 , no @entity13 ”			1
he replied , “ i thought so ”			2
then he said , “ ten @entity13 do n’t make an @entity22 ”			1
i thought , “ compliments ”			2
‘ he weighed me up and down			0

lance corporal @entity14 describes the @entity0 event as ‘ a remarkable experience … unbelievable i should say , had it happened to anyone else ’			1
but in the letter , dated december 27 , 1914 , he adds : ‘ we are at each others ’ throats again now			0
’ the letter was discovered by a collector who bought it unwittingly in a house clearance sale , historical documents expert @entity73 of auctioneers @entity72 ’s said yesterday			0

he was buried in @entity99 near the @entity13 village of @entity116			1
his name appears on a war memorial in @entity104 , @entity119			0
the letter ’s insight into the reality of the events of the 1914 truce is a contrast to the rather idealised vision of life in the trenches depicted in @entity131 ’s @entity130 ad			0
the ad has attracted more than 700 complaints , mainly from those who feel it is ‘ distasteful ’ to use war to sell groceries			0
the @entity138 , who was joined by @entity141 manager @entity140 , said the story was a ' message of hope and humanity '			2
he added : ' @entity147 had the power to bring people together and break down barriers			0
it is vital that 100 years on we keep the @entity0 truce story alive			0
' for future generations this memorial will help ensure that not just football , but also a nation , remembers			0
' supermarket giant @entity131 has also made it the centrepiece of its @entity0 ad campaign this year			1
' on thursday afternoon day before @entity162 we stood shouting at the @entity8 in @entity22 ( we can speak no @entity8 )			1
' they answered by calling us @entity22 pigs and something a bit worse , well things went on like that for some time and matters improved and we asked them if they thought their people were in @entity173			1
' this happened in the section of trench i was in charge of between myself and a couple of men of my section			0
the @entity8 only being 40 yards away and we being nearer than at any other part of the line around here			2
' well the fellow next to me asked the @entity8 to stand right up , saying he would not shoot			2
the @entity8 did , then i asked him to come out of the trench and meet one of us half way and talk			2
' he hesitated , but i assured him we would not shoot , if his fellows would not and to prove we meant it we stepped out of the trench and walked across towards them , all eyes were now watching this ( the fellow i have just mentioned took our last loaf of bread the only one we had between about 10 of us , and gave it to the @entity8 , biting a bit off at the same time to let him know we had not poisoned it			1
' well everyone was now clapping both @entity18 and @entity8 and the @entity8 also shouted ' @entity202 '			2
i walked across to my man and shook hands , i asked him how he liked it			0
' @entity206 , i wish i was back in @entity8 ( in good @entity22 ! )			1
' i said , are you losing many men			0
he said ' yes & could i make arrangements with my officer commanding to have @entity40 day and @entity212 to bury their dead and not firing			2
i said i would ask for him			0
' i wanted a souvenir so i took my knife out of my pocket and he let me cut a button from his coat			0
i could only give him a few dirty old biscuits from my pocket ... on @entity40 day i called up my friend the @entity8 and we met again halfway			2
' now out steps a @entity8 officer and comes up to me			1
the officer says , after shaking hands and in good @entity22 ' are you all @entity22 in front there and no @entity13 '			1
i answered , ' all @entity22 , no @entity13			1
' he replied , ' i thought so ' , then said ' ten @entity13 do n't make an @entity22 '			1
i thought : ' @entity232 '			0
' he weighed me up and down , gave me six cigars , some chocolate , shook hands again and turned about , went back to his trench			0
the other chap gave me a knife as a souvenir			0
' i said jokingly if he would play us a game of football			0
he said ' yes ' then i got called in again and we were soon banging away at them again			0
' but what makes it so strange to me is on each side of us they were still fighting and an officer who ordered his men to fire volleys into them when they were asking to speak had his head blown off a few hours afterwards			2
' of course we have had to forget all about that now we are at each others ' throats again ... '			0
