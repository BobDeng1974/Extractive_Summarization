it is just as well @entity2 substitute @entity1 salvaged a stoppage - time point with a header to rival @entity6 ’s super nod , for @entity7 ’ bank balance could have taken a hit had defeat been allowed to amplify his rage			1
the @entity13 boss was furious – with some justification - that referee @entity15 failed to dismiss @entity16 moments before he fired what looked to be the winning goal			1
the @entity20 midfielder was already in the book for a foul on @entity23 when , needlessly charging to close down @entity24 deep in the visiting half , he floored the winger			2
friend , though , chose not to show a second yellow			0
it was a baffling decision and left @entity7 incensed			0
@entity1 ’s equaliser , however , meant his post-match reflection was perhaps more considered , although his comments may yet be of interest to the @entity34			2
@entity1 throws his arms into the air in celebration as his header earns @entity2 a point at @entity20 on sunday @entity1 's team - mates jump on him to celebrate the goal which earned them a point at @entity43 @entity44 ( centre ) jumps upwards but can not do anything to prevent @entity1 ( unsighted ) from putting the visitors level @entity16 ( second left ) fires @entity20 into the lead from the edge of the area against @entity2 at @entity43 @entity16 holds his arm aloft in celebration after giving the home side the lead against @entity2 in the @entity56 the @entity58 midfielder runs off with his arms aloft as his @entity20 team - mates follow him to celebrate the strike @entity20 players jump on top of @entity16 as the @entity58 midfielder runs to the corner to celebrate in front of the @entity43 faithful @entity16 opens his arms and shouts his joy having smashed the @entity58 into a second - half lead in the @entity56 @entity20 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity44 6.5 ; @entity68 5.5 , @entity69 6 , @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 6.5 ; @entity72 6 ( @entity73 65 , 6 ) , @entity16 6.5 ; @entity74 6.5 ( @entity75 69 , 6 ) , @entity76 6 , @entity77 6 ( @entity78 86 ) ; @entity79 6 subs not used : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84			1

‘ given the yellow cards which were dished out and the nature of them , for him not to give @entity119 a clear second yellow was disappointing			0
he needs to be stronger			0
the lad is allowed to stay on the pitch and scored the goal which nearly means we did n’t take something from the game			2
with them down to 10 men i think we would have won			0
‘ but there is no point ( in speaking to the referee ) , the game has gone			2
i do n’t think i ’ll get an apology either , in all my years of management i ’ve never had one , so i do n’t expect it now			0
’ @entity16 , meanwhile , would have had no complaints had he been banished to the dressing - room			1
‘ if i 'd seen a second yellow , i could n't have felt too aggrieved , ’ he said			0
‘ i caught him but you ride your luck sometimes			0

and , after the eulogies which followed @entity6 ’s effort to win saturday ’s @entity166 , @entity7 was keen to extol the aerial virtues of his veteran frontman			0
‘ if you listen to what has been said over the weekend then @entity6 is only guy who scores goals like that , but that ’s an oversight on @entity1 - he ’s been doing that for a long time , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity1 has been unlucky in the last few weeks not to start more games			2
but he ’s very much valued at this club , that ’s why we gave him a new contract			0
coming on or starting , he will always have an impact – that ’s a credit to him as a professional			0
’ @entity96 ( centre ) of @entity2 is challenged by @entity20 's @entity16 ( right ) as @entity77 ( left ) looks on during the first half @entity76 ( right ) tries to stretch his foot out to reach the ball as @entity2 's @entity89 is brave and smothers it in the area @entity76 ends up upside down after @entity89 smothers the ball and prevents the @entity20 midfielder from getting a shot away @entity20 boss @entity88 smiles as he walks out for his first home match since being given the job until the end of the season @entity20 winger @entity77 ( centre ) receives treatment on the field after a strong challenge as @entity76 ( right ) leans over him @entity79 ( right ) is upended by @entity2 's @entity23 as the players clash during the @entity56 match at @entity43 @entity77 ( left ) stretches his foot highest as the @entity20 winger beats @entity2 's @entity97 to the ball at @entity43 as impressive as @entity1 ’s finish was , that @entity20 had committed so many bodies forward at that late juncture was unforgivable			1
head coach @entity88 agreed , as he fumed : ‘ there were two minutes left on the clock and we get a free - kick			1
it goes into the final third and we play four or five passes backwards and back to the keeper who kicks it			0
we were out of shape and before you know it ’s in the back of the net			0
with two minutes left you should run ball in corner			2
’ but @entity20 should have made sure of the points before that concession			2
@entity16 gave them a largely undeserved lead when he steered home low from 12 yards on 74 minutes and substitute @entity75 was sprung clear soon after			1
he , however , dithered in the area and the chance was gone			0
@entity79 was equally wasteful when blazing over moments before @entity1 ’s leveller			2
@entity88 bemoaned those misses but praised @entity16 , who , in his opinion , should not have been sent off			1
@entity79 ( right ) of @entity20 beats @entity2 defender @entity91 to the ball and directs an effort towards goal the @entity20 forward ( centre ) manages to make a nuisance of himself and get between @entity91 ( third left ) and @entity90 ( right ) @entity77 ( left ) tackles @entity145 and sends the @entity2 midfielder flying up into the air at @entity43 @entity240 ( centre , bottom ) receives treatment from the @entity2 medical team after suffering an injury against @entity20 ‘ @entity16 is a very competitive footballer and we wo n’t take that out of him			1
i thought the ref handled the game very well and , for me , it definitely was not a second yellow , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve told @entity16 he has to start scoring more and he showed good energy to get in box and get a good goal			1
‘ but it had n’t been a classic game and wo n’t be going in my @entity258 collection			0
they ca n’t be exciting all of the time though			0
sometimes you have to do what you can to win a game			0
win 1 - 0 , go home and everyone is happy			2
it is frustrating that we did not do that			0
we even had a couple of great opportunities after @entity16 ’s goal			1
’ earlier , @entity2 goalkeeper @entity89 produced an instinctive stop to keep out @entity74 ’s header and @entity44 pulled off an identical save at the other end to thwart @entity96			1
but @entity88 was right , it had been a dour affair before the relative excitement of the final 15 minutes			1
in fact , @entity15 ’s failure to send off @entity16 had given the contest a much - needed injection of incident and injustice – not that @entity7 would agree with that assessment			2
@entity20 boss @entity88 shows his obvious frustration from the touchline as the two sides battle it out at @entity43 @entity96 ( left ) gets ahead of @entity69 to direct a header goalwards , which @entity20 keeper @entity44 does magnificently to turn wide @entity44 ( left ) dives well to his left and makes a brilliant save to tip @entity96 's header round the far post at @entity43 @entity79 ( centre ) tries to get to the ball ahead of @entity90 ( left ) and the rest of the @entity2 defence at @entity43 @entity74 ( right ) of @entity20 goes down under the challenge of @entity2 's @entity24 out near the touchline @entity16 smashes a left - footed shot from the end of the area to put @entity20 into the lead against @entity2 @entity16 watches as his shot arrows past @entity89 , on to the left - hand post and then into the back of the net at @entity43 @entity77 ( right ) , @entity76 ( left ) and @entity71 ( obscured ) embrace @entity16 following the midfielder 's strike @entity16 ( centre ) sticks his arm in the air to celebrate putting @entity20 into the led at @entity43 on sunday afternoon @entity2 forward @entity1 ( right ) jumps highest to head the @entity13 level in the 90th minute as @entity20 's @entity68 ( left ) tries to compete @entity1 ( centre ) is embraced by his @entity2 team - mates after his late header earned the @entity13 a point at @entity43 the former @entity315 forward puts his arms out wide to celebrate his header which earned @entity2 a valuable point			1

@entity16 fires @entity20 into the lead from the edge of the area at @entity43 on sunday
@entity2 furious and thought @entity16 should have been sent off for a second booking minutes before
@entity97 has goal *disallowed* for the visitors after being caught *offside* before finishing into the corner
@entity1 's rose highest to head in a 90th - minute header and earn @entity2 a point at @entity43
@entity58 boss @entity88 is denied *victory* in first home match since being appointed until end of the season
