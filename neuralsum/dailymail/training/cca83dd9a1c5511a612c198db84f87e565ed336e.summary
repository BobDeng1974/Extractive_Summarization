@entity5 , 23 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , weighed 15st when she moved to the island and wore size 18 clothes			1
but after swapping an unhealthy diet of chips and sugary cereal for healthy salads , mrs @entity5 is now a slim size eight and weighs just 8st 12lb			1
but when the couple relocated to @entity4 , mrs @entity5 was left miserable and covered up her size 18 frame with leggings and dark clothes - despite the 30 degree heat			1
she even installed a temporary swimming pool in her back garden , even though the beach was just metres from her doorstep			2
' i wanted to use the beach , but i was far too embarrassed to go there , ; ' explained mrs @entity5			1
' it 's a shame i spent my first year living in @entity4 stuck inside			0
' when i lost the weight , i loved finally getting to the beach in my bikini and feeling proud of my body			2
' @entity5 said she did n't have time for a wedding diet and was forced to walk down the aisle in a size 18 dress despite living just meters from the beach in @entity4 ( left ) @entity5 was too embarrassed to wear a bikini after eating healthily through her pregnancy with son @entity22 , @entity5 decided it was time to make a change mrs @entity5 was living on an unhealthy diet of what she describes as ' rubbish ' throughout her teens , and continued to do so in the run up to her wedding			1
but shortly after the couple married , corporal @entity5 , of @entity60 of the @entity61 , was posted to @entity4 for two years			1
' there was barely time to plan the ceremony , let alone think about a wedding diet , ' remembers a rueful mrs @entity5			1
' i crammed my bulky body into my corseted wedding dress and forced myself to think about married life in sunny @entity4 with my perfect man			1
' i may not have had my dream wedding body , but i was tying the knot with my dream man and i told myself that was the most important thing			0
' stationed in paradise , the pair had an apartment which overlooked the @entity78			0
but despite living a stone 's throw from the beach , mrs @entity5 could n't face squeezing into her bikini			1
gone are the days when @entity5 covered up her size 18 frame with leggings and dark clothes despite the 30 degree celsius heat ( left ) and she is now confident in a tiny two - piece ( right ) ' i just could n't face the thought of baring my folds of flab on the beach , among the bikini - clad holidaymakers , ' she says			1
' when @entity20 was on leave from work , he 'd convince me to join him on a sunshine stroll along the promenade but being with him only made things worse			0
' the chafing on my legs was so bad i had to stop and sit down every few yards			0
we installed a pop - up pool in the back garden so i could cool off in the heat , even though we lived right by the sea			2
' in august 2011 , mrs @entity5 gave birth to her first son , @entity22			0
after eating healthily throughout the pregnancy she knew it was time to change her diet and joined her local @entity112			0
mrs @entity5 used to eat two bowls of @entity114 for breakfast , a baguette with chicken and butter for lunch and a burger with chips and onion rings for dinner			2
throughout the day she would snack on biscuits and crisps			0
but with the help of diet experts , mrs @entity5 adopted a new eating regime , which now includes fresh fruit and natural yoghurt for breakfast , a stir fry made with fresh vegetables and lean chicken for lunch and a homemade lasagne for dinner			2
@entity5 no longer feels self conscious next to husband @entity20 ( pictured with her and son @entity22 before she lost weight , left ) since her life - changing weight loss mrs @entity5 has launched her own @entity112 in @entity143 throughout the day she snacks on fresh fruit and ham			1
' i wanted to enjoy my last summer in @entity4 and i wanted to wear shorts rather than leggings , ' adds mrs @entity5			1
' finally , after a lot of hard work i felt confident enough to hit the beach in a bikini and for the first time i attracted glances from strangers for all the right reasons			0
' my husband loves me no matter what i look like			0
but he loves how much more confident and happy i am now			0
' mrs @entity5 also started walking for more than an hour every day , which combined with her healthy new diet , resulted in a dramatic 5st 3lb weight loss			2
