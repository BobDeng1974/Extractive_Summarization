by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 11:04 est , 5 march 2014 passenger planes could soon be equipped with @entity4 - style lasers which would shoot down a terrorist 's missiles			1
@entity8 's @entity7 has announced that the @entity10 system developed by defence contractor @entity11 had successfully completed tests and has been certified for commercial use			1
@entity10 uses laser technology and a thermal camera to deflect incoming missiles - after a threat is detected it fires a laser to disrupt the missile 's navigation system , taking it off course and detonating a safe distance from the aircraft			1
the futuristic defence was first ordered in 2002 by the - prime minister @entity35 after two shoulder - launched missiles were fired at an @entity8 @entity37 as it took off from @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41			1
the missiles both missed their target and none of the 250 passengers were hurt but the development of @entity10 was ordered as a direct result of the incident			2
the project was delayed for several years because of infighting among defense firms and government agencies over which one would foot the bill			0
the @entity10 system that protects passenger aircraft against shoulder - fired artillery ( file photo ) the @entity10 system was developed by @entity8 defence contractor @entity11 to protect commercial airliners from surface - to - air missiles ( file photo ) once the contract was awarded to @entity11 , the project was completed in just three years			1
' @entity10 has been validated under the most complex and sophisticated testing conditions ever conducted in @entity8 and is now ready to protect @entity8 airlines , ' @entity8 air force brigadier general @entity64 , told wired.com			1
the system will now be installed on all @entity70 airliners but @entity11 says it also has contracts with several other countries around the world			1
the approval of @entity10 comes just six weeks after another @entity8 arms company revealed details of a ground - based laser defense system which can shoot missiles from the sky with a pulse of energy			1
state - owned @entity82 said the futuristic military hardware called @entity84 was almost ready for deployment			0
the futuristic defence was first ordered in 2002 by the - prime minister @entity35 ( pictured ) after two shoulder - launched missiles were fired at an @entity8 @entity37 as it took off from @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 it works by firing a focused laser at targets which are heated so rapidly they disintegrate in an instant			1
the arms maker publicised specifications of its @entity96 ( @entity96 ) at this week 's @entity97 , which is @entity100 's largest aerospace and defense exhibition			2
' it 's exactly like what you see in @entity4 , ' said company spokesman @entity104			2
' you see the lasers go up so quickly like a flash and the target is finished			0
' countries are vying to weaponise laser technology			2
the @entity111 announced last year that it will attach a prototype of its @entity113 ( @entity114 ) to @entity115 and send the amphibious transport docking ship to the @entity117 in 2014			0
this will be the first time a laser weapon is used in active service			2
the blast of infrared energy it delivers can disable a small boat or even take down a drone from above as an impressive @entity111 video shows			0
@entity111 researchers told reporters that the laser gun , or a ' directed energy pulse weapon ' as the military call it , destroyed its targets 100 per cent of the time in testing			0
' it operates much like a blowtorch ... with an unlimited magazine , ' a @entity111 official said			0
the solid - state laser prototype does n't use up expensive ammunition so is cheap to operate			0
' its weapon round costs about $ 1 to shoot , ' said rear admiral @entity141 , a @entity111 researcher			0
however , @entity114 costs more to build in the first place - at around $ 32 million per unit .			0

@entity10 was approved for commercial use by @entity8 's @entity7
the system detects incoming missiles and automatically fires a laser which disrupts the navigation system
@entity10 will now be installed on all @entity70 airliners
