but the outgoing first minister , who dramatically announced he was stepping down from the job on friday , claimed holding a referendum was ' only one of a number of routes ' to independence			0
he said despite last week ’s referendum defeat the ‘ writing is on the wall ’ for the @entity27			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i think the destination is pretty certain , we are only now debating the timescale and the method			2

the ‘ curry summit ’ took place in mr @entity44 ’s dining room in @entity55 , @entity43 , as the results from the @entity4 referendum came in on thursday			2
mr @entity14 ’s demand for @entity40 only votes in the @entity60 threatens to deny @entity16 a chance for an overall majority after the next election			1
the @entity51 currently has 41 mps representing constituencies north of the border which would be banned from voting on any legislation only affecting @entity40 – including education and health policy			1
interviewed yesterday on @entity70 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ there are a whole range of ways @entity4 can improve its position in pursuit of @entity4 independence			1
’ he added : ‘ i think referendums are great , they have been my policy and even i have been surprised by an 85 per cent poll and the degree of public engagement , but of course for many years there was a “ gradualist ” attitude to independence			0
‘ that is to say you establish a parliament , you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you ’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent			0
many countries have proceeded through that route			0
‘ there is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well - so a referendum is only one of a number of routes			0
‘ i think it ’s the best route incidentally , that ’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many			0
’ mr @entity0 's remarks came amid mounting nationalist fury over the perception that @entity2 was wobbling over honouring its promise to devolve more powers to @entity4			1

mr @entity14 ’s demand sparked an angry backlash from @entity136 – with @entity16 accusing the prime minister of playing politics with @entity2 ’s pledge to transfer powers to @entity4			1

a @entity43 spokesman this morning said : ‘ the three pro-union parties have made commitments on further powers for the @entity12 and we have set out a clear timetable to do this			1
this government has delivered on devolution and we will do so again in the next @entity12			2
’ but mr @entity0 said the @entity153 and @entity51 should have thought about their differences ‘ before they made a solemn vow and pledge to the @entity4 people ’ and accused them of breaking their pledge			1
he said : ‘ i do n't see how they can be kept between @entity14 who says they must go in tandem with changes in @entity40 , and @entity16 who says they ca n't go in tandem with changes in @entity40			1
these seem to be two irreconcilable positions from political interest at @entity2			2
‘ it 's the people who voted @entity172 because they believed these commitments from the @entity2 leadership , these are the people who are feeling most angry , most hurt , most disappointed in @entity4 today			1

the prime minister has invited more than 20 of his mps to the 16th century @entity205 estate			0
mr @entity14 is desperate to head off a rebellion over his pledge to devolve a raft of new powers to @entity12			1
he wants to win @entity199 support in return for guarantees that he will introduce new laws blocking @entity4 mps from voting on @entity40 - only legislation			1
mr @entity0 said ‘ no ’ voters in last week 's independence referendum were ‘ tricked ’ by a late vow of more devolved powers			1
he said : ‘ i am actually not surprised they are cavilling and reneging on commitments , i am only surprised by the speed at which they are doing it			0
they seem to be totally shameless in these matters			0
’ mr @entity0 claimed that independence was now only a matter of time			2
he said : ‘ when you have a situation where the majority of a country up to the age of 55 is already voting for independence then i think the writing is on the wall for @entity2			2
‘ i think the destination is pretty certain , we 're only debating the timescale and the method			0
