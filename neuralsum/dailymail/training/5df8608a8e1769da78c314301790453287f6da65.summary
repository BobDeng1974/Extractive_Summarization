the @entity0 has identified 1,200 gp practices in @entity2 which may not be providing safe care one in six gp surgeries could be putting tens of thousands of patients at risk , according to the @entity10 watchdog			1
the @entity0 has identified 1,200 practices in @entity2 which may not be providing safe care , including 864 it has categorised as of ‘ highest concern ’			1
failings include misdiagnosing cancer , inadequate care of the elderly and making patients wait too long for appointments			1
@entity0 chief inspector professor @entity21 said most surgeries were managing to provide good care despite high demand , but added : ‘ we ’re sadly finding some very poor practices			1
‘ these typically are chaotic , have very poor leadership and a lack of learning culture			0
they also have a poor skill mix – some do n’t have any nurses			0
' patients could be at risk by simple things such as by prescribing out - of - date medicines and vaccines			0
’ the poorly performing surgeries will be prioritised for vigorous , day - long spot checks over the next two years , which could lead to the worst being closed down			1
preliminary assessments of nearly all 8,000 surgeries in @entity2 were carried out as part of a new @entity46 - style ratings system based on 38 categories covering safety and basic care			1
the surgeries have been placed into one of six categories ranging from ‘ highest concern ’ to ‘ lowest concern ’			1
patients can go to the @entity0 website to see how their surgery is performing in comparison with neighbouring practices and how they rate according to national standards			1
criteria include detection rates for cancer and dementia , opening hours , giving patients the flu jab and the numbers of frail , elderly patients ending up in @entity69 because they are not properly looked after			2
the consequences for patients of any one of these failings can be catastrophic			2
by this stage , the cancer has often spread to other organs and may have become untreatable			0
the @entity0 also identified 217 surgeries which could be putting young women at risk by not offering them screening for cervical cancer			1
a further 228 are making patients wait far too long to see a doctor or nurse			0
the surgeries were given a score for each of the 38 indicators			2
these were added together to give an overall score , with the final result determining which of the six bands they were placed in			0
there were 864 surgeries in band 1 ( ‘ highest concern ’ ) and 332 in band 2			1
by comparison there were 3,979 surgeries in band 6 ( ‘ lowest concern ’ )			1
failings identified by the health watchdog include misdiagnosing cancer , inadequate care of the elderly and making patients wait too long for appointments			1
it has categorised 864 surgeries as of ‘ highest concern ’ @entity120 , who is also a gp in @entity121 , @entity122 , added : ‘ gps are under a lot of pressure but they are demonstrating that even in deprived areas they can provide fantastic care			1
i do have concerns about access to practices			2
but we need to do more to encourage people to take better care of themselves and to make better use of pharmacies			2
’ prof @entity21 said he expected that only about 160 practices ( two per cent ) would be put in special measures , where officials from @entity2 would step in and instruct them to make urgent improvements			1
if these are not carried out , the surgeries could be closed down and patients taken on by others nearby			2
@entity144 , of @entity145 , said : ‘ the patients at these high - risk practices should be told so they have the option of going elsewhere			2
‘ that is part of the @entity10 ’s duty of candour , its obligation to be honest and open			0
over the past 18 months there has been a rise in the number of patients contacting us with concerns – most notably not being able to get an appointment , which is fundamental			0
’ gps are being warned not to close early over the festive period			0
@entity10 officials have written to surgeries over concerns they will close their doors mid-afternoon on @entity166 and @entity167 when it is traditionally quiet			2
last year @entity2 found that one in 20 gps had shut by 4pm and left patients in the hands of out - of - hours firms			1
a letter sent to practices last week – obtained by @entity176 – reminds them that @entity166 and @entity167 are ‘ normal working days ’			2
@entity179 , chief executive of the @entity180 ’ @entity178 , added : ‘ the @entity10 must be open and transparent and patients should be provided with as much information as possible about their gp practice			0
‘ we know that if patients are provided with information , they are able to make more meaningful choices about their healthcare			0
the more transparent and honest a gp surgery and its staff are , the more confidence the public will have in the system			0
’ patients can check their surgery ’s rating by going to www.cqc.org.uk/content/our-intelligent-monitoring-gp-practices and inserting their postcode			0
however , the website has already been criticised by some patients as being riddled with jargon and difficult to interpret			0
@entity202 , co-director of @entity145 , said : ‘ there are just too many patients and not enough doctors			0
@entity206 are just stretched to the limit and that is why so many patients are ending up in @entity69			0
’ dr @entity210 , chairman of the @entity211 , added : ‘ many practices are struggling to meet quality standards due to factors beyond their control , such as lack of funding , significant increases in patient consultations and difficulties in trying to recruit sufficient gps to meet patients ’ needs			0
’ @entity223 , deputy medical director at @entity2 , said : ‘ we ’re pleased this report shows that despite the increased pressure on @entity221 there are so many good and outstanding practices across the country			1
