by @entity0 for @entity1 a networking evening can be a nerve - racking and intimidating event for a budding entrepreneur breaking into the world of work			1
so when @entity8 , from @entity9 , secured a 20 minute sit - down with a successful businessman during an event in @entity13 , she was hopeful it could lead to help in the future			1
but when she returned to her room afterwards , ms @entity8 was in for a rather different proposition from the @entity20 businessman , @entity21			1
instead of offering advice , he demanded sex			2
' @entity25 , ' the message read			0
' i will not leave @entity13 without having sex with you			1
deal ? ' @entity8 , who works for a design sharing website and runs her own networking company for women , @entity32 : ' i was so flustered			1
i could n't sleep for an hour or two			1
what did i indicate to him ? ' crude : businessman @entity21 ( left ) sent an email to @entity8 ( right ) following a networking meeting saying : ' i like you a lot			1
i will not leave @entity13 without having sex with you ' shock : when she returned to her room , she found an email waiting for her asking her for sex but the next day , she discovered that another woman at the conference had received the same email from mr @entity21			1
she said : ' that eliminated the factor that i 'd brought this on myself			0
' when she next saw @entity21 - who says on his website that he specializes in ' connecting talent with right investors ' and ' providing tough love and tactical hands - on help with business strategy ' - she told him his email was ' inappropriate ' and never spoke to him again			2
he later claimed that his email account had been hacked			2
@entity8 works as @entity62 , which allows users to share designs and get feedback			1
she has been with the company just a month , according to her @entity68 page			2
she is also the founder of her own business , @entity69 , which aims to connect entrepreneurs , investors and advisers , her @entity68 page explains			0
disturbed : @entity8 , pictured above , said she was so shocked by the messages , she could not sleep @entity8 , pictured with a friend , decided to share the message to give support to other women it had happened to on the company 's @entity84 page , it explains : ' @entity86 is a group of kickass entrepreneurial women who dream big and bust their butts to make them reality			1
' by sharing her story , she feared what reaction she would get as some people might think she was attention seeking			0
but she went public in the hope it would encourage other women to speak out			0
' i believe that when women see what i posted , next time it happens , they 'll call them out , ' she explained			0
' opting to be too scared to associate my name to something like this just did not seem to be the right answer , or the type of example i 'd like to set			0
' since then , she has received numerous messages of support from both men and women			1
on @entity117 , @entity116 said : ' it takes guts to fight the good fight like this , but if no one takes a risk and talks out , these things just keep happening			0
proud of you ! ' @entity126 said : ' wish more women would stand up for themselves like you have done ! let it be the start of a trend			0
since sharing her story , ms @entity8 has received many messages of support on her @entity117 page people on @entity117 said she had shown courage for speaking out about what happened at the event @entity139 said : ' i hear that this can be looked upon as a negative in the " industry "			1
as a @entity144 ( venture capitalist ) , i completely disagree			0
we focus on teams more than anything , and someone showing this type of courage should be applauded			0
' and on @entity84 , she thanked people for the messages of support			2
she said : ' ca n't thank you all enough for solidifying that speaking up was the right decision			2
' mr @entity21 blamed the fact his @entity159 was hacked for the emails he sent to ms @entity8			1
he said : ' sorry , my @entity159 was sending phishing emails to some of you this morning			1
do not open the message			0
' when the news broke that ms @entity8 had shared her story , he followed it up by saying : ' many of you witnessed in past weeks , that my @entity159 was hacked			1
sorry for weird messages you might have received			2
do not open any attachments			0
' @entity21 describes himself online as an angel investor and a vc - venture capitalist - scout , an area dominated by men at @entity179			2
ms @entity8 thanked people for the support on @entity84 and said it reassured her she was right to speak out businessman @entity21 blamed the fact his @entity159 was hacked for the suggestive emails he sent ms @entity8 despite the lip service @entity179 has given over the past couple of years to the need to recruit more women venture capitalists , at senior levels the industry â€™s gender balance has n't budged , @entity185 reported on wednesday			1
just four per cent of senior investing partners in @entity196 venture capital are women , according to data from @entity199 , a consulting firm			0
that is down slightly from five per cent in 2010 , and about even with 2008			0
the numbers compare to 15 per cent of executive officers at @entity204 companies , 24 per cent of tenured faculty at @entity196 business schools , and 20 per cent of the @entity209 - all areas that have shown gains for gender parity in recent years while venture capital has stalled			0
the issue matters because women venture capitalists have a direct effect on the success of companies other women launch , say female entrepreneurs , including serving as role models and being more likely to spy potential in businesses that target other women .			0

@entity8 , who works for a design startup , had an *informal* 20 minute chat with businessman @entity21 in @entity13 last month
after the networking event , he sent her emails asking to have sex with her
she said : ' i was so flustered . i could n't sleep for an hour or two '
she has since received many messages of support online
@entity21 blamed the fact his @entity159 account was hacked for the crude emails
