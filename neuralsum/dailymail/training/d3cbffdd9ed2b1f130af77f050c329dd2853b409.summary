by @entity0 he is without doubt the most fashionable bunny in @entity3 – and his antics are followed by thousands on social media			1
but supermodel @entity7 ’s pet rabbit @entity8 almost came to an unfortunate end last week after he was let loose in the offices of @entity11 , home of the designer handbag			1
miss @entity7 released @entity8 , giving him free rein of the room , while she sat at a table with executives before a photo shoot			1
@entity7 , with her pet rabbit @entity8 , which has a lucky escape at @entity21 last week a source said : ‘ he was happily eating the celery out of the @entity24 and just hanging with everyone			1
‘ he was hopping around into everyone ’s lap and then @entity7 put him down on the floor so she could take a few pictures			1
it was then that he saw his moment			2
’ @entity8 is said to have spotted an air - conditioning pipe poking out of the floor			1
‘ before anyone could do anything he had launched his back paws and scuttled over to it , ’ the source said			2
‘ the last thing anyone saw was the disappearing tail			0
he did n’t get very far because he got stuck under the floor			0
’ @entity7 strokes the rabbit , which is sitting in the crook of her arm , as she walks down the street horrified staff called for the urgent assistance of maintenance men , who were forced to remove a number of floor vents so the pet could be rescued – much to miss @entity7 ’s relief			1
the 21 - year - old supermodel , who has posed for @entity54 , @entity11 and @entity55 , is known for her rather eccentric habits			1
lately these have included carting @entity8 to meetings in a bunny box			2
she introduced ‘ @entity60 ’ to the world last wednesday			0
he has since been photographed with his famous ‘ aunties ’ – her sister @entity62 as well as her friend , the singer @entity64			0
he has also been pictured frolicking around the streets of @entity66 , sitting in front of a computer keyboard and showing off his taste for @entity55			0

tweeting celebrity pets do not have a good track record in terms of their own mortality			0
@entity8 ’s dash for freedom had similarities with the sad passing of @entity124 , the in - house dachshund of magazine @entity126 in central @entity66			2
last year it had become distracted by a passing jogger and make a dash for it , through a revolving door , but sadly , it did n’t make it through to the other side			0
this despite the best efforts of two fire engines and 10 firemen .			0

@entity7 took rabbit @entity8 to offices of handbag designer @entity11
while there the pet spotted an air conditioning pipe and *climbed* down it
maintenance men had to be called to free the rabbit which became trapped
