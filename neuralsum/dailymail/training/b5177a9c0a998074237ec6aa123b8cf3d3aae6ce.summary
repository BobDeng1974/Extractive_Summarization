by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 06:08 est , 20 june 2013 @entity3 post-menopausal women are 50 per cent less likely to be offered treatment for vaginal problems than those in @entity7 and the @entity8 , a new study has found			1
around one and a half million women in the @entity3 suffer from the post-menopausal condition called vaginal atrophy which is caused by a deficiency in oestrogen			1
but new research has found that just 21 per cent of sufferers in the @entity3 are being given access to appropriate treatments such as oestrogen therapy - 50 per cent less than those in @entity7 and the @entity8			1
ignored : just 21 % of @entity3 women suffering from vaginal atrophy are receiving appropriate treatment for the condition as a result , many women in @entity3 avoid sex with their partners because of the condition , which causes vaginal dryness , itching and painful intercourse			1
the study , called the clarifying vaginal atrophy 's impact on sex and relationships ( @entity39 ) study which has been published in @entity40 , is the first of its kind			1
it found the lack of treatment in the @entity3 led to @entity3 post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy having less sex than women in @entity7 and @entity49			1
over 60 per cent said fear of painful sex was one of the main reasons they avoided intimacy , with almost one third of women and male partners saying that vaginal discomfort had caused a ' big problem ' for their sex lives			1
dr @entity62 , co-author of the study and associate specialist gynaecologist at the @entity65 , said : ' given the obvious impact of vaginal atrophy on women in the @entity3 , and their partners , it is very sad to learn that we are lagging behind other @entity72 countries in terms of ensuring appropriate access to treatment			1
it is possible to enjoy an intimate love life if you suffer with the condition , providing you have access to the correct treatment ' it is our hope that the closer study will encourage our fellow medical professionals , and women themselves , to routinely raise the topic of post-menopausal vaginal health , thereby facilitating appropriate diagnosis and treatment			2
' before the menopause the skin and tissues around the vagina are kept supple and moist by fluids and mucus			0
these are made by glands at the neck of your womb			0
and also affects your tissues in and around your vagina , causing the lining of your vagina to be thicker and more elastic			0
@entity108 also stimulates the cells that line your vagina to produce glycogen , a compound which encourages the presence of helpful germs ( bacteria ) which protect your vagina from infections			0
after the menopause your ovaries make less oestrogen			0
the lack of oestrogen leads to thinning of the tissues around your vagina and a reduction in the number of glands that make mucus			2
you may also lose some fat tissue from around the genital area			0
vaginal atrophy is a condition that causes dryness , discomfort and can make having sex difficult			1
after the menopause a woman 's ovaries make less of the hormone oestrogen			0
the lack of oestrogen leads to thinning of the tissues around the vagina and a reduction in the number of glands that make mucus			2
this can be very uncomfortable but it can also lead to serious long - term urogenital problems if left untreated			0
it can also have a significant emotional impact on women as it often leads to reduced intimacy with partners			0
it is possible to manage the condition providing you have access to the right treatment			0
treatment options include hormone replacement therapy ( @entity158 ) , oestrogen cream or pessaries and lubricating gels			2
vaginal atrophy can lead to serious long - term urogenital problems if left untreated because it can thin the bladder wall			2
it can also have a significant emotional impact on women as it often leads to reduced intimacy with partners			0
local oestrogen is the main treatment recommended by the @entity170			0
@entity3 women who tried local oestrogen treatment for vaginal atrophy reported beneficial effects such as less painful sex , more satisfying sex for their partner and themselves and having sex more often			1
' more than two - thirds of @entity3 women in @entity39 used lubricants and moisturisers to treat their vaginal symptoms , but these are not as effective as oestrogen therapy as they do not treat the underlying cause , ' explained dr @entity186 , co-author and @entity188 , @entity189 's & @entity190 and @entity190 & @entity191 , @entity192 , ' local oestrogen offers women a well - tolerated and effective solution to vaginal atrophy which , as the closer study illustrates , can significantly disrupt many relationships			1

just 21 % of @entity3 women suffering from vaginal atrophy receive treatment for the common condition caused by a lack of oestrogen
symptoms can be distressing and reduce intimacy within a relationship
but various therapies including @entity158 can easily treat the condition
