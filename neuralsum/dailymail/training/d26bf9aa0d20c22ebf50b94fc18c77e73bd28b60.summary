by @entity0 pygmies developed their small size to allow them to travel through the rainforest easily , researcher have claimed			2
they say the small body size associated with the pygmy is probably a selective adaptation for rainforest hunter - gatherers			1
however , they say that all @entity11 pygmys do not have the same genetic change , suggesting a more recent adaptation than previously thought			1

researchers say that all @entity11 pygmys do not have the same genetic change , suggesting a recent adaptation			1
a phenotype is the outward expression of genetic makeup and while two individuals with the same phenotype may look alike , their genes may differ substantially			0
the pygmy phenotype exists in many parts of @entity31 , @entity32 , the @entity33 and potentially in @entity34			0
the phenotype is usually associated with rainforest hunter - gathers , groups of people who do not farm , but obtain resources by hunting large and small animals and gathering fruit , nuts , insects and other available resources ' i 'm interested in how rainforest hunter - gatherers have adapted to their very challenging environments , ' said @entity48 , assistant professor of anthropology and biology , @entity51			1
' @entity53 rainforests are difficult for humans to live in			0
it is extremely hot and humid with limited food , especially when fruit is not in season			2
' @entity48 and colleagues looked at the genetics of the @entity62 hunter - gatherers of @entity15 and compared them to their farming neighbors , the @entity65 , with whom they traditionally traded forest products for grain , and sometimes intermarry			1
the researchers also looked at the @entity71 hunter - gatherers and their farming neighbors the @entity73 in @entity31			1
they report their results in the @entity75			0
the average height for @entity78 men is five foot and for women it is four foot eight inches			2
their short stature is not caused by a single genetic mutation as occurs in many forms of dwarfism , but is the result of a variety of genetic changes throughout the genome that influence height			2
researchers say the small body size associated with the pygmy is probably a selective adaptation for rainforest hunter - gatherers the researchers investigated 16 different genetic locations that were associated with short stature when they looked at individuals who were an admixture of @entity78 and @entity65			1
several of these regions contained genes known to be involved with growth in humans			0
they then studied these regions to look for indications that the changes were ones that persisted because they were adaptive			0
short stature may be adaptive for rainforest individuals for a variety of reasons , according to @entity48			0
small bodies require less food , which is adaptive for a food - limited location like the rainforest			1
small bodies also generate less heat , which , in the heat and humidity of the rainforest , is adaptive			2
it is also easier for small , agile individuals to move through dense undergrowth and to climb trees .			0

*diminutive* height is selective adaptation for rainforest hunter - gatherers
small bodies also require less food and give out less heat
all @entity11 pygmys do not have the same change , suggesting it is recent
