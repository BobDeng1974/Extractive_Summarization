federal officials , amid the worst @entity1 biosafety crisis in years , have dismissed 11 eminent scientists from a 23 - member panel that advises the government on how and whether research on dangerous pathogens should be conducted			1
the purged members were informed that their service was no longer needed via an email on sunday night from @entity12 , executive director of the @entity13 ( @entity13 )			0
two of the dismissed members told @entity16 that the notice came without warning			0
the panel is overseen by the @entity20			0
serious safety concerns : the @entity22 has revealed still more safety breaches at some of its top level labs and 11 scientists from a 23 - member safety panel were fired via email sunday night the action , first reported on @entity32 's website , came two days after federal health officials released details of an investigation of the mishandling of anthrax samples by scientists at the @entity22			1
according to the @entity40 , four of the scientists have since signed a petition to limit the types of research that may be done into highly dangerous flu types over fears of potential release			1
that probe turned up numerous additional breaches at @entity22 , igniting concerns about how scientists at the agency and nationwide handle dangerous microbes			1
in one newly disclosed incident , @entity22 scientists contaminated samples of low - pathogenic bird flu viruses with a highly pathogenic strain and in march shipped them to a @entity59 lab , where the viruses promptly killed all the chickens exposed to them			1
on wednesday , a subcommittee of the @entity63 is scheduled to hold a hearing on the @entity22 's biosafety lapses			2
‘ add these to the long list of questions we have about how biosecurity is being managed , ’ said @entity63 chairman @entity66 , a @entity68 @entity67			0
‘ why has n't the panel met in years , and why is now the time to dismiss nearly half the experts on this panel tasked with advising the administration on biosecurity ? ’ string of mistakes : the action came following an investigation into lab safety brought on after dozens of lab technicians and @entity22 staff were potentially exposed to live anthrax due to human error in june in the sunday night email from @entity20 , which was reviewed by @entity16 , @entity12 wrote that she ‘ wanted to tell you that a new slate of @entity13 members has been approved as your replacements , and thus your service on the board is ending			1
’ ‘ this may come as welcome news ! ’ she wrote , adding that the departing members ‘ will be missed			0
’ an @entity20 spokeswoman said in a statement on tuesday that ‘ it is routine for federal advisory committees to rotate their membership over time so that fresh and diverse perspectives can be brought to bear , ’ and that the dismissed scientists ' terms ‘ had been renewed several times			2
’ one of the dismissed members , @entity108 of the @entity109 , tweeted that it was a ‘ bizarre time to eliminate all institutional memory			0
’ the biosecurity board does not approve particular experiments but offers policy advice on , among other things , oversight of ‘ dual use ’ studies , meaning research that could be used for biowarfare or bioterrorism as well as for legitimate @entity124 2012 , for instance , the board recommended that details of experiments on an especially deadly form of avian influenza , @entity128 , not be published			1
they feared the information could be used to create a strain that , unlike the natural form , is highly transmissible between infected people			2
another error : health officials have revealed that a bird flu breach occurred in addition to the anthrax debacle			1
a @entity22 lab sent another lab a sample that was supposed to be weak bird flu but had been contaminated with a potent strain and killed all the lab chickens exposed to it at the time , the board 's concerns led to a 60 - day self - imposed moratorium on @entity20 - funded projects on @entity128			1
one of the dismissed board members expressed surprise that the purge included virtually all of the people with experience of the @entity128 debate and included experts known for communicating openly with fellow scientists and the public on biosafety issues			0
dr. @entity162 of the @entity163 in @entity164 , for instance , co-authored a 2012 editorial in the journal of the @entity167 on the @entity128 debate , calling for ‘ a clear scientific rationale ’ for studies that enable pathogens to be more deadly or contagious than they are in nature			0
@entity162 was dismissed from the advisory board on sunday night			0
also dismissed was microbiologist @entity174 of @entity175 , who played a crucial role in the investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people and infected another 17			1
@entity174 's dna analysis of the anthrax mailed to @entity1 senators and news organizations allowed investigators to trace the bacteria to an @entity187 lab in @entity188			2
‘ i fell over in my seat , ’ @entity189 , executive director of the @entity190 , said of the advisory board dismissals			0
given the @entity22 's recent biosafety missteps , ‘ this seems to not be the time to make major changes			2

in a newly disclosed incident , @entity22 scientists contaminated a weak bird flu strain with a vicious strain that promptly killed a *group* of lab chickens
the action came two days after federal health officials released details of an investigation of the mishandling of anthrax samples by the @entity22
dozens of @entity22 *employees* were potentially exposed to anthrax after a high level lab failed to *inactivate* samples it sent to several other labs
four of the scientists had signed a petition raising *alarms* over fears that research into flu viruses could lead to deadly release
