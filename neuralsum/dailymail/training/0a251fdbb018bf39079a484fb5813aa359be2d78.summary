by @entity0 last updated at 1:00 am on 4th february 2012 @entity1 was stripped of the @entity3 captaincy for the second time yesterday and a number of team - mates believe he should not be picked by @entity7 while allegations of racism persist			1
the decision , taken by the 14 members of the @entity13 board , was communicated first to @entity7 on thursday night and then to @entity1 at 10am yesterday in a call from @entity13 chairman @entity15			1
the news was broken by @entity17			0
@entity1 faces trial on july 9 , having been accused of a racially aggravated public - order offence against @entity20			1
@entity1 denies the charge , but the @entity13 have decided it would be inappropriate to let the 31 - year - old @entity24 defender lead @entity3 at this summer ’s @entity25			1
given the boot : @entity1 has been stripped of the @entity3 captaincy - for the second time - because he faces criminal charges over allegations he racially abused @entity30 defender @entity20 on a dramatic day … losing the @entity3 armband has left the defender considering retirement from international football , and @entity35 understands @entity1 was made aware a number of his black @entity3 team - mates had an issue with him — over his clash with @entity20 at @entity40 on october 23 — during their last get - together			1
yesterday , former @entity43 striker @entity42 became the latest black football figure to speak out against @entity1 — joining @entity45 and @entity46			2
tv pundit @entity42 told the @entity47 : ‘ they have made the right decision			0
i just found it incredible that @entity1 could think he could lead @entity3 into the @entity25			1
i do n’t even think he should go to @entity51 — i do n’t think it would be good for the team			0
’ family man : father - of - two @entity1 with his wife @entity56 @entity1 , stripped of the captaincy two years ago amid the controversy of his affair with @entity60 and @entity35 ’s revelation that the @entity63 box he was given at a discounted rate was being offered on the black market , is said to feel betrayed by the @entity13			1
but he may also feel it is difficult to face hostility in the dressing room when he is no longer skipper			0
the decision to delay his trial until july 9 makes it additionally complicated for him			0
the @entity13 made the unprecedented move of cancelling the pre-match handshake at last saturday ’s @entity75 tie between @entity30 and @entity24 because @entity20 and his team - mates were planning to snub @entity1 and it is believed @entity79 players , with @entity80 among them , were planning to do the same at @entity81 tomorrow before @entity1 was withdrawn through injury			1
the issue is a nightmare for @entity7			0
he reinstated @entity85 as captain a year ago , ignoring warnings that the move could come back to bite him			0
now he has lost his captain in chaotic circumstances for the second successive tournament , and is left with problems when it comes to appointing a replacement			0
after the way @entity7 handled replacing @entity80 with @entity1 last year , it is no surprise that the @entity79 defender does not want the job			1
he tweeted yesterday : ‘ i do n’t want to be @entity3 captain after the last episode , just want to concentrate on playin for utd & if i make the squad then as ever i ’ll be delighted			1
’ @entity104 ’s @entity103 is the right man if he is fit and in form			0
he captained @entity3 at the @entity106 and handled his media responsibilities extremely well			0
but concerns over @entity103 ’s fitness do not make him the automatic choice , even if @entity7 ( right ) would prefer to go with one of the senior players			2
@entity113 is a major candidate , with the likelihood @entity115 will miss the tournament through injury making the @entity120 man ’s place in the side more secure			2
beyond that , @entity7 may well consider @entity124 ’s @entity123 ; an experienced club captain and someone now among the first players on the @entity3 team sheet despite missing out on @entity130 selection			1
@entity131 could also be a contender if he can prove himself worthy of a place in @entity3 ’s first @entity133 @entity134 would have been considered had he not been suspended for the first two games in @entity136 and @entity137			2
@entity138 would be a reluctant skipper and @entity139 , while a certainty to start every game , is likely to be dismissed on the grounds he is too young			0
@entity7 , while accepting the @entity13 ’s right to strip @entity1 of the captaincy , is far from happy			1
the decision has been taken while he is in @entity147 and his stance on @entity1 has not changed			2
the manager made a recent visit to @entity24 ’s training ground just to see @entity1			1
but @entity15 and the @entity13 board have made the correct call			0
they have to consider the public image of the @entity3 team			0
it is believed they stopped short of suspending @entity1 from international football altogether because it would set a dangerous precedent ahead of @entity1 ’s case at @entity163 ’ court			1
race row : the moment @entity1 ( in the black shirt ) is accused of racially abusing @entity30 defender @entity20 ( centre left )			1
he denies any wrong - doing an @entity13 statement read : ‘ following the decision to adjourn the court case against @entity1 to july , the @entity13 confirm he will not captain the @entity3 team until the allegations against him are resolved			1
‘ the @entity13 board expected the trial to be concluded prior to the @entity25			0
further to wednesday ’s confirmation that the trial will not take place until after the tournament , the board has collectively decided it is in the interests of all parties that @entity1 has the responsibilities of captaincy removed at this time			2
‘ this decision has been taken due to the higher profile nature of the captaincy , on and off the pitch , and the demands and requirements expected of the captain leading into and during a tournament			0
‘ the @entity13 board can confirm that he has not been excluded from the squad and that @entity7 is free to select him for the @entity196 fixture on february 29 and the @entity25			2
‘ @entity13 chairman @entity15 has spoken to @entity1 and @entity7 to explain the facts to them			1
@entity7 has not been involved in the @entity13 board discussions which reached this conclusion , but understands that the @entity13 board has authority to make this decision			1
‘ @entity7 will take the decision as to who will be made captain moving forward			2
‘ this decision in no way infers any suggestion of guilt in relation to the charge made against @entity1			2
the @entity13 will not be making any further comment on this matter			0
’ @entity103 is the odds - on favourite to take @entity1 's armband for the @entity51 opener , according to @entity218			2
the @entity104 skipper is a warm 2/5 favourite to take over from @entity1 should he be stripped of captaincy , with @entity139 next in at 5/1			0
@entity139 's teammate @entity113 earns an 8/1 quote while @entity24 's @entity131 and @entity138 are outsiders at 20/1 and 33/1 respectively			1
@entity1 is also now odds - on ( 8/11 ) to not start the opening match against @entity226			0
@entity227 of @entity218 said : ' @entity103 appears the obvious choice with the odds reflecting that			0
' should the armband be passed to another @entity24 player punters will be in for a bumper payday			0

@entity24 defender , 31 , *informed* of @entity13 's decision this *morning*
move comes two days after court sets trial date for @entity1 to answer charge of racially - abusing @entity30 player @entity20
it emerged @entity3 manager @entity7 was not consulted and does not agree with the decision .
@entity79 defender @entity80 — *brother* of @entity20 and @entity1 ’s *predecessor* as @entity3 captain — ruled himself out of contention to be the new skipper .
@entity7 began deliberating over @entity1 ’s replacement , with his options limited . @entity113 and @entity123 are among the leading contenders .
@entity24 boss @entity255 backed @entity1 and said he would remain @entity24 captain .
