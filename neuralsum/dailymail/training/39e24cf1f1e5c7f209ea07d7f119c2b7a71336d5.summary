by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 08:47 est , 7 august 2013 journalist @entity0 has been on the receiving end of online abuse but believes the @entity4 campaign was a waste of time sunday 4th august was a day to celebrate , not just because it was my youngest sister ’s 20th birthday , but also because on a certain social network there was a distinct lack of the usual pompous , self - promoting prattle			1
in case you missed it – then let me enlighten you : some of @entity19 ’s foremost ‘ twitterers ’ , who also happen to be ‘ feminists ’ ( although their definition of the term seems to change by the day ) had – in a spectacular paddy – decided to ‘ protest ’ against @entity26 and not use it on sunday 4th august			1
the reason ? certain opinion formers had received abusive tweets and , even though @entity26 had already caved into their demands of formulating an abuse button , forged ahead - galvanizing their followers with a 24 hour protest			1
@entity35 ! this meant that they and their merry band of toadies would neither be indulging in the usual self - congratulatory claptrap or selling themselves via inane tweets for a whole 24 hours			2
the usual suspects who took part in ' @entity45 ' – who primarily use the site to flog themselves and their god awful products - included @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
naturally a @entity26 - lite sunday was chosen for the ‘ protest ’ - how on earth would those hallowed celebrities and writers truly cope if they could n’t promote the usual tat and self - promoting baloney they persistently foist on us the other six days of the week ? you ’d be forgiven for assuming that i too joined the hallowed ones in their protest – after all i ’ve received death threats , crude insults and the like ever since i penned ‘ that ’ piece about being beautiful last year			1
but you would be wrong if you presumed that i would entertain the silly season ’s latest luvvie cause			0
you see i do n’t subscribe to the @entity19 ’s version of the ‘ sisterhood ’ : i adore my husband , i ’m proud of the fact he comes first in my life and i come first in his			0
i ’m unrepentant of the fact that i prepare a meal for him every night in my spick and span home			0
i could have joined in with the ' feminists ' and listed my own impressive roll call of insults – but why bother ? the ‘ threats ’ ( truthfully they 're just mindless prattle ) are as likely to be acted on as i ’m to be invited to ‘ sups ’ at ms @entity85 ’s house			1
for it was @entity85 who led the # twittersilence campaign			1
lucky you if you do n’t know who ms @entity85 is ! a ‘ writer ’ , perhaps best known for wittering on about popular culture in a broadsheet and emphasising her point in @entity99 ( and i thought it was only my @entity101 – who left school at 14 – who resorted to such writing )			1
writer @entity85 ( left ) led the @entity4 campaign in protest against online trolls and presenter @entity51 ( right ) was another celebrity to take part in the sunday silence ms @entity85 can do no wrong in the eyes of the chattering classes – @entity113 and her ilk			1
naturally then , when she decided to take a stand against ‘ twitter abuse ’ she also encouraged her followers to do the same			0
this from a woman who has tweeted that @entity121 ' hate women and gays and f * * * kids '			0
@entity124 and her ilk are , to my mind , little more than jumped up attention seekers desperate for a cause – and any ole cause will do			0
as for @entity131 , i fear her university and broadcasting career have been eclipsed by her dogged whinnying about the threats she ’s apparently received			0
i do n’t deny it - it ’s horrible to be on the receiving end of such abuse			2
but i ’ve performed my own reality checks in the past : is someone really going to announce on @entity26 that they ’re going to rape , bomb or do something to one or other of my bodily parts ? highly doubtful			2
furthermore it ’s a waste of public money to insist the authorities investigate such messages			1
which is why whenever i receive such missives i treat them with the contempt they deserve – deleting them and getting on with my life			0
tweet relief : @entity0 and showbiz editor @entity157 were two journalists happy to see @entity85 and co. off @entity26 for the day summer 2013 is n’t a period in time we ’ll look back on as women with our heads held high			1
the bonkers ‘ project ’ @entity164 has n't helped ( which i have tweeted about – calling it the ‘ he looked at me , therefore he wants to rape me ’ website )			0
and now this ! we women are in danger of replicating the mass hysteria last seen in the @entity176			0
i ’m ashamed right now to be a woman when i read some of the foul diatribe aimed at men			0
why ? because stunts like this really do prove that we are the weaker sex			0
was @entity26 any the worse for the lack of celebrity posturing yesterday ? was it filled with abuse ? no , it was n’t			2
in fact many of @entity124 's happy band continued to tweet and retweet throughout the day - laughably undermining their objective			2
as for yesterday 's ' campaign ' , channelling the spirit of @entity85 i have this to say : ‘ # twittersilence ? @entity196			1
@entity0 says that she does n't subscribe to the @entity19 's version of ' sisterhood ' and is proud that her husband @entity199 is the top priority in her life			2

group of media opinion formers took part in their own protest on 4th august
campaign *pioneered* by feminist writer @entity85
other *members* of # @entity4 group were @entity51 and @entity50
silence on the social networking site meant as protest against trolls
@entity0 has been target of online abuse
says is a waste of public money for authorities to investigate every message
*enjoyed* a day without ' pompous , self - promoting prattle ' on @entity26 though
