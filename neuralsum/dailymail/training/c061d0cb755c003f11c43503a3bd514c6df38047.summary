researchers have issued a fresh warning over using electronic gadgets before bed			0
a major new study found that the light from the gadgets can disrupt sleep patterns			1
it is the first to study e-book users and readers of paper books			1
tablet readers took longer to fall asleep and spent less time in @entity14 sleep , the study found previous research has shown that blue light suppresses melatonin , impacts the circadian clock and increase alertness , but little was known about the effects of this popular technology on sleep			1
the use of light emitting devices immediately before bedtime is a concern because of the extremely powerful effect that light has on the body 's natural sleep / wake pattern , and may thereby play a role in perpetuating sleep deficiency			1
' we found the body 's natural circadian rhythms were interrupted by the short - wavelength enriched light , otherwise known as blue light , from these electronic devices , ' said said @entity39 of @entity40 , who led the study			2
' participants reading an @entity43 took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness , reduced melatonin secretion , later timing of their circadian clock and reduced next - morning alertness than when reading a printed book			1
' the research , published in published in the @entity51 today , found of a light - emitting electronic device ( @entity43 ) in the hours before bedtime can adversely impact overall health , alertness , and the circadian clock which synchronizes the daily rhythm of sleep to external environmental time cues			1
previous research has shown that blue light suppresses melatonin , impacts the circadian clock and increase alertness , but little was known about the effects of this popular technology on sleep			2
the use of light emitting devices immediately before bedtime is a concern because of the extremely powerful effect that light has on the body 's natural sleep / wake pattern , and may thereby play a role in perpetuating sleep deficiency			2
during the two - week inpatient study , twelve participants read le - e - books on an @entity71 for four hours before bedtime each night for five consecutive nights			1
this was repeated with printed books			2
although @entity71 were used in this study , @entity40 researchers also measured other ereaders , laptops , cell phones , led monitors , and other electronic devices , all emitting blue light			2
the order was randomized with some reading the @entity71 first and others reading the printed book first			0
participants reading on the @entity71 took longer to fall asleep , were less sleepy in the evening , and spent less time in @entity14 sleep			1
the @entity71 readers had reduced secretion of melatonin , a hormone which normally rises in the evening and plays a role in inducing sleepiness			0
participants who read from the @entity71 were less sleepy before bedtime , but sleepier and less alert the following morning after eight hours of sleep			0
additionally , @entity71 readers had a delayed circadian rhythm , indicated by melatonin levels , of more than an hour			0
participants who read from the @entity71 were less sleepy before bedtime , but sleepier and less alert the following morning after eight hours of sleep			0
' in the past 50 years , there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality , ' stated @entity107 , phd , @entity109 , @entity110 , chief , @entity112 of @entity113 and @entity114			0
' since more people are choosing electronic devices for reading , communication and entertainment , particularly children and adolescents who already experience significant sleep loss , epidemiological research evaluating the long - term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed			0
' researchers emphasize the importance of these findings , given recent evidence linking chronic suppression of melatonin secretion by nocturnal light exposure with the increased risk of breast cancer , colorectal cancer and prostate cancer .			0
