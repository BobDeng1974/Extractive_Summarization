tattoos might be skin deep , but you ’ll need pretty deep pockets if you decide to have them removed later on , according to new research			0
luckily for @entity7 , who have covered their bodies in ink , they 've earned $ 75m ( £ 47m ) this year alone			2
a clinic has analysed the body art of the four tattooed members of world - famous boy band @entity7 and found that - should the boys ever regret going under the needle - it would cost them almost £ 68,000 collectively to make their tattoos just a ‘ @entity18 ’			1
because it ’s necessary to wait at least six weeks between removal sessions , which normally last around 40 minutes , @entity26 would n’t be tattoo - free for 38 years			1
@entity36 has undergone quite the transformation in the last four years , abandoning his squeaky - clean image			1
but should @entity36 regret the rock - and - roll look , he will have to fork out £ 19,250 and spend more than 100 hours under the laser			1
and it would take him a total of 17 years to achieve a blank canvas			1
that 's a long time ! @entity36 would have to fork out £ 19,250 and spend more than 100 hours under the laser if he decided to get rid of his ink world famous : @entity26 has the most body art , but removing his famous tattoos would set him back over £ 31,000 , the most of all the bandmate if @entity53 decides he ’s over his tattoos , he will need to find time in his hectic tour schedule for more than 100 removal sessions , over a 12 - year period , at a cost of £ 11,894			1
@entity60 , who has the least ink of all the boys , would still need to spend almost two full days ( 44 hours ) in the chair for 66 individual sessions over eight years			2
perhaps this news will put @entity66 - the only tattoo - free member of the band - off having any body ink			1
although the @entity7 boys might still love their tats , clinics are witnessing a 52 per cent increase in the number of tattoo removal enquiries in the past six months across the @entity76 , with the cost of removing a small , black and white tattoo starting at around £ 400			0
a spokesperson for @entity80 , who commissioned the research , said : ' body art is a lifetime commitment but people change and , sometimes , the symbols we once wore proudly become something of an embarrassment			0
ink also ages and degrades along with our skin , so it may not look as good decades later			2
ink - free : the @entity7 boys have dramatically changed their image since finding fame with the boyband in 2011 ' while the technology to remove ink is improving , this is not a great reason to rush any tattoo decision or to take risks with the artist			1
always look at the previous work of the actual artist , not just the shop , and be sure to check the standards of equipment and hygiene			0
' it 's also worth knowing that factors like colour , position and size make a significant impact on the cost and ease of removal - just in case you end up regretting your decision			0
' @entity124 , founder of @entity126 - based tattoo removal specialist , @entity127 , added : ' the time needed to remove a tattoo varies according to the individual , as do the chances of wiping out all trace of the design			0
skin type , the colour and location of the tattoo , scarring and the degree of density will all make a big difference			0
' the laser technology used to remove tattoos has come on leaps and bounds in the past few years and the introduction of a state - of - the - art laser called @entity148 means tattoos can now be removed in a third of the time of a normal machine			2
' most people do n’t realise that removing tattoos can take months or even years , because laser sessions should be at least six weeks to three months apart to get the best results and minimise the risk of scarring and other side effects			0

@entity26 would have to spend more than £ 31,000
@entity36 would need £ 19,000 for 150 sittings over 17 years
boy band would have to spend *435* hours , over a period of 75 years collectively , to return to ink - free skin
