' meanwhile @entity31 tried to make light of the situation by adding : ' well the site is down so i guess that 's @entity37 's way of telling me to keep my money			2
' the company 's @entity40 feed is asking shoppers to send a direct message with their details so the customer service team can contact them , but is not saying how long the issue will take to fix			2
speaking to @entity47 , a @entity2 spokesman blamed high demand for the crash			1
anger : @entity2 has been advising frustrated shoppers to send their details over in a private message on @entity40 , but there is no word on how long it will take the site to go back online discounts : the crash comes just days ahead of cyber monday , the biggest online shopping day of the year , with @entity1 customers expected to spend £ 649million in 24 hours the crash comes just days ahead of cyber monday on december 1 , the biggest online shopping day of the year , with @entity1 shoppers making 7.7million purchases worth around £ 600million in just 24 hours last year			1
this year that number is expected to jump significantly as more @entity1 retailers promote heavy discounts , with £ 649.6million expected to be spent			1
@entity2 is a fashion company that has 6million visitors to its site every month , with just over 1million of those coming from the @entity1			1

from one computer in a @entity82 apartment to office blocks in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity74 : the rise of @entity2 @entity87 , founder of @entity2 , who sold the business for £ 350million in 2010 back in the year 2000 , when @entity87 first floated the idea of an online store for high fashion , internet shopping was in its infancy			1
wireless had yet to break into the mainstream , and most people had not yet conceived of a world in which people could shop from their phones , let alone tablet computers			0
so when ms @entity87 suggested launching a website selling high fashion labels , she was laughed at , with investors refusing to believe that women would ever use the service			1
despite this , she decided to press ahead with the idea , and set up a webpage linked to a single computer in an apartment she had rented in @entity82			0
orders came through to ms @entity87 and her team of 15 staff via a painfully slow dial - up connection			0
all of the stock was piled at the back of the room , and it was up to this small team to make sure everything was packaged and sent out correctly			0
the workload was punishing , made worse by the fact that ms @entity87 was pregnant at the time			0
in newspaper interviews since , she has confessed to crying every night during the first year , unable to cope with the pressure			0
she need n't have worried			0
the site was an online shopping revolution , rolling designer boutique and glossy magazine into the one product , and sales took off			2
in 2010 ms @entity87 sold the business to luxury group @entity135 , whose stable includes luxury brands @entity137 and @entity138 , for £ 350million - pocketing around £ 50million herself			0
at the time , she said : ' there were a lot of unimaginative private - equity people who said that women would never shop online			0
