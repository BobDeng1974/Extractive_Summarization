ahead of this weekend 's quarter - finals , @entity1 's experts in @entity2 run the rule over the eight remaining teams at the @entity6 ... @entity7 strengths : there is a balance that somehow works			1
not the best side on paper but sum of their parts may be greater than the rest			1
weaknesses : @entity18 is often exposed ; @entity19 and @entity20 are red cards waiting to happen ; and @entity22 has struggled			1
can they win it ? probably not			2
could beat @entity25 , but could struggle if they face @entity2 in the semi-finals			1
if he imposes himself on the game , the rest falls into shape			1
engine room : former @entity34 midfielder @entity29 ( left ) and @entity20 @entity25 strengths : they have the world ’s best keeper in @entity39			1
in midfield they have unlimited attacking options			2
weaknesses : the indulgence of captain @entity45 in the centre			2
he should be playing full back			2
defence is vulnerable and they will be beaten by the best teams			1
can they win it ? no , they will come up short			2
more passes than any other player so far at the @entity6			1
he is the heartbeat of the team			2
pass master : @entity60 and @entity25 midfielder general @entity54 ( right ) @entity2 strengths : @entity63 , especially now he is fit for friday night ’s game			1
wide man @entity65 is improving and @entity67 and @entity68 can look solid			2
weaknesses : over-reliant on @entity63 ; @entity71 as a target man ; @entity73 not imposing himself ; the nerves that may overwhelm them — it ’s a long list			2
can they win it ? yes , but only because there is a determination not to fail			2
when he plays , they function ; when he ’s denied space , they falter			2
main man : @entity87 's @entity63 has been by far @entity2 's best player at the @entity6 so far @entity89 : @entity2 @entity90 strengths : @entity93 passing , speed down the flanks , clinical finishing			1
coach @entity96 has worked out a system to mitigate the absence of @entity99			2
weaknesses : @entity101 has been imperious but at some point the 38 - year - old defender will be exposed			1
the back four is yet to be tested			0
can they win it ? the heart says yes , the head says @entity2 will end the fairytale			1
key man : the star of the @entity6 , @entity110 — that ’s @entity111 — @entity112			1
perfect 10 : @entity114 man @entity112 has been a revealtion at the @entity6 for @entity90 @entity116 strengths : same as they ever were : @entity119 and that array of attacking options			1
that said , in reality the difference between them and the others all boils down to one man			0
weaknesses : defensively they are a shambles at times			0
a really good side , who can dominate possession against them , will expose that			0
can they win it ? yes			0
they are finding a way to win despite their problems			0
key man : everything starts and finishes with @entity119			0
weight of expectation : @entity119 is the man @entity116 hope will deliver them the @entity6 @entity146 strengths : rarely concede and boast lots of match - winners			1
have the capacity to get much better			0
weaknesses : players like @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 are all gifted , but sometimes play like they ’ve never met each other before			0
can they win it ? perhaps , if they can build on what they have and keep their defensive line strong			0
they are n’t the same team without their composed captain			0
rock solid : @entity167 and @entity146 captain @entity163 ( left ) is at the heart of his country 's defence @entity172 strengths : they have match - winners and a smart coach who has convinced them they ’re better than they are			1
players like @entity180 and @entity181 can turn games			0
weaknesses : they lack quality throughout the team			0
their defence is n’t good enough to get the job done at this level			0
can they win it ? we may have seen the best of them already			0
could struggle against a top side			0
has gifts that most players can only dream of			0
speed merchant : @entity172 winger @entity180 ( left ) has enjoyed a flying start to the @entity6 @entity89 : @entity172 @entity202 strengths : hungry and energetic with terrific spirit			1
@entity207 ’s pace and @entity209 ’s craft build on a strong defensive base			0
weaknesses : the element of surprise is wearing a little thin			0
@entity214 will miss the quarter - final through suspension and they are not deadly in front of goal			1
can they win it ? it would be a fabulous story but — no. key man : @entity225			0
the keeper has been inspirational			0
he is an athletic shot - stopper who commands his area			1
striking it rich : @entity231 youngster @entity207 ( left ) has been a standout performer for the surprise packages			1

@entity6 quarter - finals begin on friday night
