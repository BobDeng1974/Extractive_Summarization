the @entity2 said he learnt about economics at a young age , watching his family struggle to balance the books and realising ' you ca n't spend money you do n't have '			1
he invoked @entity21 as he spoke of a ' greater moral purpose in politics ' to leave the next generation better off			0
the @entity7 have stepped up their attack on @entity15 's economic record , warning @entity27 and @entity28 have not learnt the lesson of the spiralling deficit they left in 2010			1
but in a speech in @entity33 today , mr @entity2 struck a personal note with his recollections of how money was tight growing up			1
he was born in @entity37 , the middle child of five sons			0
his father @entity40 , who came to @entity41 from @entity42 , worked around the clock as a bus driver , earning him the nickname ' mr @entity46 '			1
when mr @entity2 was four , his father took over a ladieswear shop in inner - city @entity50 , and the family moved into a two - bedroom flat above it			1
three brothers shared on room while mr @entity2 and another younger brother were in a room with their parents			0
' i learnt about economics at a young age , ' he said in today 's speech at the @entity63 in @entity64 ,			1
' my father came to this country with virtually nothing			1
' but he worked hard on the buses to save enough money to start his own business			1
he began with a market stall and then he eventually opened a shop			2
' he recalled how living above the shop he would ' help out whenever i could '			2
' that background taught me some valuable lessons			2
it taught me that you need to plan ahead			2
' it taught me that you 've got to live within your means			1
it taught me you ca n't spend money you do n't have			1
' these are lessons this government understands			0
steadily , step by step , we are getting our country 's economy back on track and we are getting the deficit down			2
we have a plan and it is working			0
' he insisted the task to cut the deficit had to continue , to ensure the debts were not left for future generations			0
' a former banker , mr @entity2 was elected as an mp in 2010 , and became @entity100 minister two years later			0
in april this year he joined the @entity101 as @entity2 , after @entity102 was forced to resign over her expenses			0
he said : ' it was @entity21 who said ' we in politics are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all '			0
' i agree there is no greater moral purpose in politics than that – to leave our children something better than we ourselves have known			0
that is why we have to get the deficit down			0
' mr @entity2 accused @entity15 of planning to spend and borrow more if elected in 2015			2
the country , he said , faced a ' serious decision ' at next year 's general election about whether to continue with the current @entity83 's ' long - term economic plan ' it was putting into action or to ' hand @entity27 the keys to @entity130 and to go back to @entity15 's approach of higher taxes and more spending '			1
a former banker , mr @entity2 was elected as an mp in 2010 , and became @entity100 minister two years later			0
in april this year he joined the @entity101 as @entity2 , after @entity102 was forced to resign over her expenses he added : ' do we continue to do the right thing , getting the economy back on track and getting the deficit down ? or do we return to spending more than we can afford and allow the deficit to continue for decades to come ? ' the deficit he said was already down by more than a third , was predicted to fall to half by the time of the election in 2015 and then be eliminated before the end of the next parliament			0
he said : ' when it comes to the deficit , @entity15 have n't learnt their lesson			2
no matter what they say in public , @entity15 are still planning to spend more and borrow more if they are elected			2
' spending and borrowing run through @entity15 like the words in a stick of rock			0
' he claimed that @entity15 's future plans would mean in 21 years time the government would still be running a deficit of £ 24 billion in today 's money			1
' for every child in @entity41 today this is equivalent to an extra £ 35,000 of debt on each of their heads			1
more debt than they could ever hope to repay			0
' our plan to run absolute surpluses is the only reliable way to get the size of @entity41 's debt down to safe levels over a sensible time scale			1
' but @entity15 's shadow chief secretary to the treasury , @entity177 , said : ' these numbers have been totally made up			1
@entity15 has not set out any plans for extra capital spending after the election , so this is just another example of the @entity7 lie machine in action			1
' @entity2 should look at what is happening under his government			0
not only has @entity187 failed to deliver rising living standards he is also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year			0
in fact , this government is set to borrow £ 190 billion more than planned in 2010 and borrowing is going up not down so far this year			0
' he added : ' @entity15 has set out a tough fiscal commitment to balance the books - on the same measure used by @entity198 in this parliament - and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next parliament			2
' we will get the deficit down where this government has failed , but we will do so in a fairer way - including by reversing @entity187 's tax cut for millionaires			1
