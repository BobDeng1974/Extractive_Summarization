' i never thought there would be so much variation until i saw a yellow and blue box in @entity47 , boxes in @entity0 and @entity71 are white with red printing and the @entity47 box was just so completely different i was intrigued			0
' it was when i saw that there was a series of boxes from a food distributor , i knew it was something possible to collect			0
