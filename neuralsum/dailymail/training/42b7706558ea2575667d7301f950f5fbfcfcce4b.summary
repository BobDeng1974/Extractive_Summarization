by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:33 pm on 21st july 2011 detectives have been criticised for a ' shocking and disgraceful ' conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was revealed how they took a key murder trial witness to a brothel , paid him cash and allowed him to take cannabis and heroin in their company			0
a @entity15 ruling has unearthed how ' supergrass ' and convicted robber @entity16 had sex with a policewoman , socialised at officers ' homes and visited pubs while in custody as @entity24 sought to secure his continued co-operation			1
the force also ignored a number of violent crimes allegedly committed by @entity16 , including the brutal rape of his cellmate and the vicious stabbing of a fellow prisoner with broken glass bound with twine			1
convicted robber @entity16 , pictured left in 1996 , was the main prosecution witness in the case of @entity37 , right , who admitted murder last month @entity16 received special treatment because he was the main prosecution witness in the case of @entity37 , who last month admitted murdering 85 - year - old @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 in 1996			1
@entity37 and his brother , @entity43 , were originally found guilty of the attack after a @entity47 @entity46 trial in 1998 , but the convictions were quashed by the @entity49 in 2009 on the grounds they had been ' procured by gross prosecutorial misconduct '			1
the @entity15 judgement , published on wednesday , reveals for the first time the ' variety of wholly inappropriate benefits ' given to @entity16 by @entity42 officers five @entity15 judges ruled by a majority of three to two last year that @entity37 should face a retrial			1
more than Â£ 3million of taxpayers ' money had been spent on the case by the time he finally admitted his guilt , for which he received a 17 - and - a - half - year jail term			0
the @entity15 judgement , published on wednesday , reveals for the first time the ' variety of wholly inappropriate benefits ' given to @entity16 by @entity42 officers			1
one judge , @entity67 , who took the view that @entity37 should not have been retried , found that a large number of officers , including ' several of very high rank ' , were engaged in a ' prolonged , persistent and pervasive conspiracy to pervert the course of justice '			1
officers colluded in @entity16 's perjury during the trial , the judge found , intending him to lie throughout his evidence about how he had been treated			1
they ensured @entity16 's police custody records presented a ' false picture of the facts ' , even forging one to conceal the truth , and they lied to the @entity84 after the trial			2
lord @entity67 stated : ' to describe police misconduct on this scale merely as shocking and disgraceful is to understate the gravity of its impact on the prosecution process			0
' it is hard to imagine a worse case of sustained prosecutorial dishonesty designed to secure and hold a conviction at all costs			0
' none of the officers involved in the case have been prosecuted or disciplined			0
all have since left the police service and at least one is understood to be living abroad			0
the full extent of the corruption was uncovered by a @entity104 investigation on behalf of the @entity105 , which probes potential miscarriages of justice			0
it is understood that some @entity42 officers refused to co-operate with the inquiry			0
investigators found that @entity16 regularly had sex with a woman police constable but he cheated on her when her colleagues took him to a brothel - a trip described on the custody record as an outing to ' assist in the locations of crime '			2
@entity16 wrote to the woman officer , apologising : ' i was drunk and stoned on weed , they paraded a dozen beautiful women in front of me and said take your pick			2
' it is alleged that @entity16 later assaulted the officer after they broke up , but the case was one of several against him which were not prosecuted			2
@entity37 's solicitor @entity135 said he was stunned by the ' incredible scale of the malpractice exposed '			2
deputy chief constable @entity138 said : ' in relation to the original investigation back in 1996 , the methods used to deal with the main witness were wholly unacceptable and can not be condoned in any way whatsoever			1
' following the @entity104 inquiry ' the @entity84 concluded there were no criminal offences committed by any officer '			0
mr @entity138 said : ' since the original investigation was carried out 16 years ago there has been a complete root - and - branch overhaul of procedures to safeguard against such failings and to prevent them from ever happening again			0

@entity24 also ignored a number of violent crimes allegedly committed by @entity16
he received special treatment as he was a main witness in the retrial of @entity37
officers intended @entity16 to lie throughout his evidence about how he had been treated
