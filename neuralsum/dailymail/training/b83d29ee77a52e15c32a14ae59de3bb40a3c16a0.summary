by @entity0 published : 17:42 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 10 february 2013 only 15 of the hundreds of foreigners who took part in the riots of 2011 have been deported , the @entity1 can reveal			2
ministers had promised to get tough after violence and mayhem tore apart @entity10 cities , but the vast majority of overseas nationals who joined in the destruction are still here			1
a combination of @entity18 law and human rights rules is thought to be blocking efforts to deport them and could lead to large numbers being granted the right to stay			1
carnage : although more than 200 foreigners were convicted of taking part in the 2011 riots in @entity26 , only 15 have been deported mayhem : rioters throw missiles at lines of riot police in @entity26 in august 2011 while officials have managed to kick out 15 of the rioters , another 31 have been told they can remain in the country despite their crimes			1
more than 200 foreign criminals were convicted for their part in the riots in which shops were plundered , businesses set ablaze and hundreds of millions of pounds of damage done			2
among the offences they carried out were burglary , robbery , theft , criminal damage and disorder			2
if the remaining cases follow the same pattern – of one rioter kicked out for every two who remain – it would mean more than 130 ending up staying in @entity54			1
many remain behind bars at a cost to tax - payers of tens of thousands of pounds a week – but more than 80 are at large having been released			1
and three convicted foreign rioters have been ‘ lost ’ by the @entity60 after failing to comply with bail conditions			2
ministers had pledged to take tough action to kick out foreign criminals as quickly as possible after the riots in august 2011 which began in @entity66 , north @entity26 and spread across the country into several nights of carnage			1
@entity71 minister @entity70 said at the time : ‘ we strongly believe that foreign national lawbreakers should be removed from the @entity54 at the earliest opportunity			1
thugs : people try to kick in the window of a jeweller 's shop near the @entity81 shopping centre in @entity82 , central @entity10 , as violence spread outside @entity26 violent : among the offences carried out by foreigners in the riots were burglary , robbery , theft and criminal damage @entity26 's burning : shops and residential properties on fire in @entity94 during rioting in the summer of 2011 ‘ we also have the power to cancel visas of foreign nationals found guilty of criminal activity , and this is something we will be looking to do when these cases arise			1
’ in the following months , it emerged that @entity104 nationals played a central role in the mayhem			2
figures from the courts showed one in seven of all convicted rioters was from overseas			2
the @entity111 released a list showing 44 nationalities of convicted rioters , including those from @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			1

other rioters came from @entity126 , @entity127 , the @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			2
the true number of foreign nationals may be even higher as 4 per cent of those taken into remand during the riots refused to tell police their nationality			2
the @entity60 has set up a special unit , known as @entity139 , to track down and remove foreigners involved in ‘ serious criminality ’			2
mob mentality : masked rioters taunt police in @entity66 in august 2011 chaos : riot police form a line as they attempt to stop rioters in @entity66 during the summer of 2011 but figures released after a request under the @entity151 show their record to date is lamentably poor			1
of the 201 cases passed to @entity60 , only 15 have been kicked out			0
some 28 have been given permission to stay because they ‘ do not meet deportation criteria ’			1
three others have been allowed to remain after legal appeals			1
a total of 63 are still in prison , or in immigration detention awaiting deportation			1
pledge : @entity71 minister @entity70 said at the time that the government strongly believed that foreign offenders should be deported the fact that they are still behind bars suggests officials are more confident of eventually removing them			1
another 53 are at large but classed as ‘ still being considered for deportation ’			1
there are 31 who have been given temporary admission while their cases are considered			0
the three who have absconded have not been named and officials refused to reveal any further details			0
five others are still waiting to be sentenced			0
@entity18 rules prevent officials even trying to deport any @entity182 nationals sentenced to less than two years in prison			1
non-eu nationals do not qualify for automatic deportation unless they were jailed for at least 12 months			2
@entity186 , director of the think - tank the @entity188 , said : ‘ the average rioter in 2011 had already committed 15 offences , so the public have a right to expect them to be punished properly			0
they will be appalled by these figures , which show just how important it is to fix our human rights laws			1
’ last night , immigration minister @entity199 said : ‘ many of those convicted of involvement in last summer ’s riots are still behind bars – that ’s where they belong			2
‘ we are pursuing deportation in scores of cases and wherever possible , when they have paid their debt to society , we will remove them from the @entity54			1
’ a gang that made millions of pounds smuggling immigrants in at a rate of ten a day has been broken up			0
