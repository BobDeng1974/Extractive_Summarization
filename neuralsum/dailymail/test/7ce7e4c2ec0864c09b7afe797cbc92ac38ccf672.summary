it is the disease the medical community refuses to accept , and most experts claim is just a mental illness			1
morgellons disease has been described by those who suffer from it as causing fatigue and memory loss , while also leading to large sores on the body which are constantly itching to the sensation of bugs or parasites crawling underneath the skin			1
from these sores they claim sprout colorful fibers that can not be described and , according to one person , ' can not be forensically identified as animal , vegetable or mineral			2
' that person is @entity22 , who claims to have suffered from @entity23 for most of her life , and who has recently been hospitalized after she was found unconscious at her home			1
@entity27 , who suffered from polio as a child , remains in the hospital , but is said to be in ' good spirits			0
' she went on to say ; ' fibers in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm ... @entity23 is a slow , unpredictable killer - a terrorist disease : it will blow up one of your organs , leaving you in bed for a year			2
' this is far different than the way many in the medical community describe the disease however , which , according to the @entity61 , is incredibly rare and effects predominantly middle - aged white women			2
the @entity64 reports that the symptoms are very similar to those of mental illness , from the sensation of crawling and bugs and parasites to the concept of false beliefs			1
the @entity64 even conducted a study at one point , and found that most people who claim to suffer from the disease were likely just experiencing anxiety , depression or , in some cases , issues with substance abuse			1
@entity27 admitted to briefly having problems with addiction in a @entity86 interview , saying ; ' i did n’t get involved for years , and then i went on @entity88 and they asked me how i wanted to be paid , and i ran away to join the circus : clowns used to get paid in wine – pay me in cocaine because everybody was strung out on cocaine			2
' a 2012 paper published in a peer - reviewed medical journal found that half of the 115 subjects tested positive for a prescription or illicit drug , among them ; amphetamines , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , cannabinoids , and even cocaine			0
futhermore , most of the fibers collected from their skin were cotton , likely from clothing or bandages , and no parasites were detected in any of the individuals			0
the medical community believes @entity23 is likely a mental illness and that sufferers are anxious , depressed or even suffering from substance abuse ( @entity27 above in 1996 ) @entity118 , the director of the @entity119 and herself a registered nurse takes issue with this study			1
' a serious and often deadly systemic infection is present in @entity23 samples			0
still patients are being prescribed antipsychotics while the infection goes undetected and untreated , ' she told @entity129			0
' clouding the picture is that some patients do exhibit psychiatric manifestations			0
but spirochetal infections , such as @entity134 , are well known to affect the central nervous system and cause psychiatric symptoms			0
yet the infection is ignored while dermatologists offer dangerous antipsychotics as the only treatment			0
' some individuals have said that taking antibiotics cured them of @entity23 , though some experts could bring that back to the idea of mental illness and claim it is simply a placebo effect			1
researchers and experts meanwhile do accept that @entity23 exist , just not as an actual medical condition			1
@entity27 meanwhile has long been committed to having morgellons recognized for what she believes it to be - an ' incurable disease			0

@entity22 was hospitalized on *tuesday* after being found unconscious in her @entity159 home
@entity27 has suffered from @entity23 disease throughout her life , and has recently dedicated herself to trying to get it accepted as a medical condition
sufferers claim they feel the sensation of bugs or parasites constantly crawling under their skin and biting them
they also say they are constantly itching , and large sore develop on their skin from which colorful fibers grow
the medical community believes it is likely a mental illness and that sufferers are anxious , depressed or even suffering from substance abuse
@entity27 , who has been a heavy *smoker* since she was 9 - years - old and had polio as a child , has admitted she dealt with cocaine addiction in the *70s*
individuals have said that taking antibiotics cured them of @entity23 , though some experts say it is simply a placebo effect
