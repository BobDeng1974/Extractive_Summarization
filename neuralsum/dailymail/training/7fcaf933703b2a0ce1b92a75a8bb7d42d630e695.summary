' i know where the $ 470 million could have been better spent on @entity40 , ' she added			0
' and what do we really know of the free trade deal with @entity44 ? we will get rid of our tariffs from day one but what about them , they have still got their tariffs in place , when will the @entity44 act on that , we have n't been told			0
and the @entity54 president was not immune to criticism			0

she would go on to win the seat of @entity71 and stood as an @entity126 and a year later the @entity2 would enter @entity40 's political landscape			1
at the two subsequent elections , with redistribution effectively forcing her out of @entity71 and into @entity129 , ms @entity0 would prove unsuccessful despite enjoying very strong primary support			2

' i 'm sick and tired of all the corruption and lies and there is too much interest in overseas interest			0
' despite her support for @entity171 she said it had become clear to her that @entity174 's @entity9 group was not going to be the alternative third major party @entity40 were hoping for			2
' i 'm very disillusioned by it and i honestly believe i can make a difference ' said @entity0 ' i was hoping @entity174 and his party would be able to do it but they have n't , ' she said			2
' how can you criticise @entity8 ? i wo n't , she has stood up for what she believes in and in some ways she is being that individual on the floor of parliament that i was , i ca n't criticise that			2
' i 've been sent to prison and ridiculed all my political life but i have n't given up			0
' i got pushed out of my own party in 2002 but i rejoined last year and now it 's time to rebuild it			2
' this is a huge decision for me but i have always tried to keep @entity40 aware of what is going on			0
' they describe me as far right wing , i am not , i am centre and that 's what @entity40 want			0
they want to know about their jobs , the home they hope they can afford and if they get sick that they will get a hospital bed			0
' she sounded a warning to the major parties saying ' they know i can take away their voter base , like i did before '			0
