up to nine eurosceptic ministers are to demand that @entity1 grants them the freedom to campaign for @entity3 to leave the @entity4 if the @entity5 remain in power after the general election			1
several @entity5 members of the @entity9 are thought to back a @entity3 exit if significant powers can not be repatriated from @entity12 ahead of an in / out referendum			0
one @entity15 source said the prime minister would risk ‘ splitting the party ’ unless he suspends the normal convention of collective cabinet responsibility , to allow ministers to join either the ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ campaigns			1
details of the divisions came as a former senior eurocrat accused the prime minister of diminishing @entity3 ’s influence in the @entity4 and weakening its relationship with @entity40			1
@entity41 , the former president of the @entity42 , said that under mr @entity45 is no longer at the centre of @entity4 decision - making and has lost its position as an important point of contact between the @entity40 and @entity50			1
and he warned that mr @entity1 ’s ‘ aggressive rhetoric ’ against @entity12 could lead to a @entity3 exit from the @entity4 if a referendum is held			1
if re-elected , mr @entity1 has pledged to seek to negotiate a looser , more trade - based relationship with @entity12 and then ask voters to approve or reject it in a referendum by the end of 2017 – with a ‘ no ’ vote meaning @entity3 would leave the @entity4			1
@entity59 has already indicated that backbench @entity60 who want to campaign for @entity3 to leave the @entity4 , whatever deal the prime minister secures , will be free to do so			1
chancellor @entity64 said : ‘ ultimately it will be a free vote			0
’ former senior eurocrat @entity41 accused the prime minister of diminishing @entity3 ’s influence in the @entity4 and weakening its relationship with @entity40 however , mr @entity1 has so far dodged the question of whether ministers will also be free to join whichever side of the argument they support			1
mr @entity41 , who was succeeded by @entity74 last month , said mr @entity1 had a ‘ difficult relationship ’ with the @entity4 because of the ‘ pressure ’ from the @entity76 in the @entity5			1
‘ i see @entity1 as basically a very pragmatic leader , someone that certainly wants to defend the interests of his country , ’ mr @entity41 told @entity78 ’s @entity79			2
‘ but while , with @entity85 , @entity3 was really playing a very important role in the @entity4 , they were at the centre of decisions , today this is no longer the case			2
‘ the @entity40 president , if he wants to get @entity50 countries on board , i think the first call he makes is the chancellor of @entity96 , no longer to the @entity3 prime minister			2
’ mr @entity41 said a @entity3 exit from the @entity4 would be a ‘ real mistake from all points ’ and warned mr @entity1 against continuing to attack @entity12 in the run - up to his promised referendum if he wanted the @entity3 to remain part of the union			1
he said : ‘ i think many people that are going to make the case when the time comes , and if there is a referendum , i think the majority will be in favour			0
‘ but it depends now on leadership in @entity3			0
the current situation – putting the blame on @entity50 – makes it harder			0
’ former prime minister @entity118 allowed his ministers to vote with their consciences on @entity50 , something @entity1 is unlikely to do in the 1975 referendum on whether @entity3 should join the @entity122 , prime minister @entity118 decided to suspend collective responsibility because his party was similarly split on the issue			1
cabinet ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and also to campaign against each other			0
seven @entity131 cabinet ministers – @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 – went on to argue unsuccessfully against @entity3 ’s membership			0
some of mr @entity1 ’s allies argue it would be embarrassing for him to make a similar move if he is recommending voters stay in the @entity4 , since it would undermine his argument that his concessions have made a significant difference			2
but the @entity15 source insisted : ‘ @entity118 did just the same as @entity1 : promised to renegotiate and then hold a referendum			0
‘ he will be very wise to suspend collective responsibility			0
it is the only way to avoid resignations and ensure once the referendum result is in , everyone comes back together			0
’ several cabinet ministers , including @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , have already suggested publicly they would be likely to vote for an exit on the current terms			0
mr @entity158 , the @entity5 policy chief , said he was ‘ not sure ’ whether the prime minister would succeed in persuading other member states to make concessions on issues such as border control			0
another cabinet minister , @entity166 , has insisted @entity3 should have ‘ no fear ’ of life outside the @entity4 .			2

nine ministers are to demand for the freedom to campaign for an @entity4 exit
*pm* risks ' splitting the party ' if he does not let ministers join campaigns
former @entity180 says @entity1 has weakened @entity3 **'s** influence in the @entity4
@entity41 says @entity161 also weakened @entity3 **'s** relationship with the @entity40
