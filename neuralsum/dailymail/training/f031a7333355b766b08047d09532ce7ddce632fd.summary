by @entity0 @entity1 was given a rousing send - off by @entity3 as he said goodbye to the club he 's served for eight years , claiming his heart will always be at @entity7			1
the central defender was handed a present by sir @entity10 before @entity12 ' side played @entity13 on tuesday night			1
and even though the 32 - year - old started on the bench at @entity7 , he did get a run out in his final home game for the @entity18			2
@entity12 had planned to give @entity1 his standing ovation later on as @entity3 fans caught a final glimpse of a man who has been a terrific servant for the club since joining from @entity40 in 2006			1
and he was emotional when the time came to say goodbye			2
' physically i will leave but my heart will always be at this club			0
i 've spent so many years here , ' @entity1 said			1
' i 've worked with so many great people and will always watch and care about @entity3			1
' it was a tough season			0
it has been a tough night - it was very emotional			1
he won five @entity51 titles , the @entity52 and three @entity53 under previous manager sir @entity55			1
but as @entity3 changed under @entity57 , certain players became surplus to requirements			1
while there would have been very little resistance to @entity1 penning a new deal for at least another year , he felt the time was right to jump ship			2
@entity12 said afterwards : ' @entity1 goes with all our best wishes of success in the coming years			2
' cracking send off : @entity1 was centre of attention after kind words from interim manager @entity12 the final walk : @entity1 began on the bench at @entity7 during his last home game for the club see you soon ! @entity1 applauds the supporters and said his heart would always be with the club writing in the matchday programme , he said : ‘ thank you for all the support you have given me over the years			1
i know i will be supporting the club in the future			0
‘ you never know what 's going to happen with emotions			0
you can try to predict but i was n't emotional before and i have n't cried yet			0
' @entity1 admits the lap of the pitch wo n't be the same without a trophy but that it is ' the least the players can do ' to thank the supporters			2
he said : ' as we did n't do well this season , that walk around @entity7 wo n't be the same after many years where we have always been celebrating something after the final game			0
now , it has become a chance to thank the fans for supporting us this year			0
i think this is definitely the least that we can do			0
' we must perform in these last games to give them something to look forward to next season and to believe this team can win again			0
that is what the players are thinking about now - to try to put on good performances and build on that next season			0
