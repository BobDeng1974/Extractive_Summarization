but he previously told the newspaper he agreed with what his wife wrote			2
the column said @entity3 have become ' raging @entity53 ' after drifting ' to the right ' for the past four decades			2
' @entity55 and the @entity56 are simply the devil in disguise and cable television and the @entity60 are his playground			0
the @entity22 are his evil minions , ' she wrote			2
@entity17 is a city of about 19,000 in the western part of the state , about 115 miles southwest of @entity66			0
@entity16 pastor @entity67 said the opinion piece was not the cause of @entity15 ' departure			1
' that 's what people have made it out to be , ' @entity67 said			0

it 's not clear whether @entity14 also attended @entity16			1
' i did n't find the column to be the sort of lighthearted poking that one would typically find in satire , ' @entity86 said			0

' @entity86 said the column also mischaracterized the convention 's stance on the @entity107 policy			0
the @entity3 's action last month ' was a very balanced resolution that did n't denounce the @entity22 , ' @entity86 said			1
