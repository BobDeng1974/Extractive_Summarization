by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 12 august 2012 updated : 19:52 est , 12 august 2012 the live - in boyfriend of an @entity3 mom who disappeared last year has been charged with her murder even though the woman ’s body has never been found			1
the alarm was only raised about @entity8 , 28 , when her sister conducted her own search after not having heard from her in weeks			0
@entity12 ’s boyfriend and father of her child , @entity16 , now 34 , eventually confessed to police that he killed @entity12 by hitting her in the head with a hammer but he thought it was all a dream			1
missing : though @entity8 's boyfriend admitted that he killed her , no physical evidence has ever been found except from some blood stains on the carpeting of the @entity3 trailer the couple shared the case against @entity16 has been complicated as police have been reluctant to follow up due to a lack of hard evidence - and diminishing resources			1
the latest change has been an upgrade in @entity16 ’s charge , as he originally faced a voluntary manslaughter charge but now heads to court with a full murder charge			0
adding to the problematic twists in the case is the well - being of @entity12 and @entity16 ’s child , who has been in care of @entity12 ’s family since @entity16 was arrested for an unrelated crime in late september of last year			1
@entity12 ’s sister @entity43 travelled to @entity12 ’s home in @entity45 , @entity3 in august 2011 after she had n’t heard from her sister in an unusually long amount of time			1
on top of that , @entity12 ’s boyfriend @entity16 was giving @entity52 unclear answers , continuing to say that when @entity53 called , @entity12 had just stepped out of the house , or was unavailable to speak , and he never knew when she would be back			1
charged : now @entity16 , 34 , is charged with @entity57 's murder , months after he admitted to hitting her repeatedly with a hammer though he initially thought it was only a dream though she alerted @entity45 police that she was concerned about her sister ’s welfare during that august trip , no real breaks in the case came until september 28 , 2011 when police responded to the home where @entity12 and @entity16 lived			1
at the time , @entity16 was wearing an ankle monitoring bracelet for criminal activity that has yet to be released , and police arrived at the home because the bracelet had been cut off			2
@entity16 was taken into police custody , charged with attempted escape , and sent to the @entity78 jail			2
the @entity79 reports that in october , @entity16 told a fellow inmate that he tried to kill @entity12			0
that tip prompted a search warrant of the trailer that @entity12 and @entity16 shared and police found blood stains on the carpet and bedroom that matched that of @entity12			2
for some unknown reason , police only interviewed @entity16 directly in january , and that was the first time that he confessed to killing @entity12 directly to authorities			0
the affidavit states that @entity16 told police that ‘ he and @entity8 had been fighting for three days ’ leading up to her reported death around july 1 , 2011			1
@entity98 reports that the fight was over prescription pills			0
‘ @entity16 stated that he fell asleep on the couch and he awoke to @entity8 hitting the couch with a hammer			2
@entity16 stated that he believes that @entity8 hit him on the head with the hammer and knocked him out			2
‘ @entity16 stated that , when he came to , @entity8 was dead on the floor and bleeding from the head			0
@entity16 said that he has memories of hitting her in the head with a hammer but thought that it was a dream			1
’ the @entity111 reports that he told police that he put a plastic bag over her head , wrapped her body in a tarp , and put it in a garbage container that was picked up later that day			1
trouble : the two - year - old child shared by @entity57 and @entity16 was used as a part of a now - revoked plea deal that police had offered @entity16 in exchange for more clues about @entity57 's body during the interrogation process , @entity16 directed police to a local landfill and after the spent six days looking through 6,000 tons of trash , they still found no clues relating to the case			1
because the body has never been found , @entity16 was originally charged with voluntary manslaughter			0
another aspect of the case has been the couple ’s son , and @entity16 tried to bargain with prosecutors over releasing further details about the murder in order to secure custody of the 2 - year - old child			0
after learning of the prospect that the child may go back into the care of the accused murderer , @entity12 ’s family were predictably upset and petitioned the courts for the plea deal to be taken off the table			0
the next formal verdicts in the case will come when it goes to a jury trial on august 21 , but until then the fight between the @entity12 family and the local police will likely continue to play out , as they blame @entity78 prosecutor @entity156 with failing to properly inform the @entity157 about the details of the plea deal			0
‘ this case is so screwed up , ’ @entity8 ’s father @entity12 told the @entity79			0
‘ something needs to be done			0

@entity57 , 28 , went missing in august 2011 from her trailer home in @entity45 , @entity3
