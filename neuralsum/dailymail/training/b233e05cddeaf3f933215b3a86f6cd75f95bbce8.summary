by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:04 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 14:36 est , 14 march 2014 federal reports have revealed that terrorists would only have to sabotage nine out of the 55,000 electric - transmission substations across the @entity6 in order to cause a national blackout that could last for more than a year			1
a coast - to - coast blackout has become a very harrowing - and plausible - prospect that has scared federal regulators into issuing warnings calling for widespread security precautions to be put into place			2
the @entity15 has published the findings from a @entity17 that told how the three electric systems could be brought down entirely by attacks on select stations			2
three parts : the @entity6 energy grid is made up of three systems that only have minimal interactions which means that only nine stations would have to be attacked to shut down the whole system ' destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire @entity6 grid would be down for at least 18 months , probably longer , ' wrote @entity17 's director of external affairs @entity31 in a june memo that was only revealed publicly today			1
adding to the problem , the solution is not as simple as just protecting these nine stations because there are reportedly 30 stations that meet the necessary criteria but less than a third of them have to be attacked			0
experts differ on the number of stations that would fall into said category - with others putting it closer to 100 - but it does not diminish their concern			2
â € ˜ it is neither a monumental task , nor is it an inordinate sum of money that would be required to do so , â € ™ former @entity17 chairman @entity52 said in an email to the @entity15			0
at the moment , existing laws focus on security protocols at nuclear power stations as opposed to those that deal with standard electricity			0
attacked : fears were renewed over the safety of electricity plants after an attack on the @entity66 plan in @entity67 , @entity68 which took place in april 2013 when one or two men attacked 17 towers in less than 20 minutes concerned : senators @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) were two of the four who are now pushing for an exploration of a security expansion for many electric plants in light of sabotage fears the stations are owned and operated by private companies , and many of them only have cameras and chain - link fences to fend off attackers			1
should the attack focus on only one of the country 's three major systems , that would n't be much help to those effected , however , because the three systems interact so minimally that it would be very difficult to transfer electricity from one system to another			1
concern about attacks on power plants was renewed after a strike on a power station in @entity68 in april 2013			1
one or two gunmen were able to break into a @entity106 station in @entity67 , cut the communication lines and then go on to shoot up 17 transformers in under 20 minutes			2
they were able to flee before police arrived because it took so long for any 911 calls to go out since they had knocked out the fiber optic cables serving the facility which facilitate phone calls			0
' this was n't an incident where @entity118 and @entity119 decided , after a few brewskis , to come in and shoot up a substation , â € ™ retired vice president of transmission for @entity106 , @entity124 told @entity15 in february			0
lit up : the @entity126 sheriff 's office released this surveillance footage of the attack which shows the gunshots going off on the grounds of the @entity106 facility @entity132 flew : no one was injured and the power did n't actually go out in the area because the state grid was able to maintain it but officials fear that it was a test run ' this was an event that was well thought out , well planned and they targeted certain components			1
' power in southern @entity68 did not go out after this incident because the state grid operator was able to prevent the fallout , but it did prompt enough concern to make experts fearful			1
in february , four @entity151 senators sent a letter to federal regulators asking if they needed to install mandatory security standards for power companies to enforce at their plants			1
senators @entity158 of @entity159 , @entity73 of @entity160 , @entity72 of @entity68 and @entity161 of @entity162 wrote that the sabotage was a " wake - up call to the risk of physical attacks on the grid			2
" ' this incident came uncomfortably close to causing a shutdown of a critical substation which could have resulted in a massive blackout in @entity68 and elsewhere in the @entity173 , ' they wrote			0
in december , @entity17 chairman @entity174 told @entity175 grid security is a top priority , and her agency cooperates with utilities to protect physical equipment			0
federal cybersecurity standards for protecting the grid are in place and mandated			0
however , rules for protecting physical sites such as transformers and substations are voluntary .			0

federal regulators fear that the three main electricity systems for the @entity6 could be entirely wiped out after a small but targeted attack
concerns *raised* after a ' test run ' attack on a @entity67 , @entity68 electric plant where one or two people broke in and *wrecked* 17 towers
the *culprits* were never found and the area did n't lose power because the state grid was still working but experts thought it could have been practice
there are around 55,000 power plants around the @entity6 but anywhere between nine and 100 would have to be attacked to ruin the system
' the entire grid could be down for 18 months , probably longer , ' according to a memo to *government* officials
