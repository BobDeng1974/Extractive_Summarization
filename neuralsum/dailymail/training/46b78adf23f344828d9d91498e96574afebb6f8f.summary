@entity0 believes @entity1 will be able to produce more of the kind of fluid football this season that made them such a force last term and has backed them to show their creativity in monday 's @entity12 clash with @entity13			1
the @entity15 ' 2014 - 15 top - flight campaign got under way last sunday with a 2 - 1 home win over @entity18 , a result @entity0 felt his men had had to ' grind out '			1
certainly , it was not a performance akin to those they were putting on for much of the conclusion to 2013 - 14 , in which they fell just agonisingly short of claiming the @entity12 title			2
but despite all the change and the fact that many of his squad came into pre-season off the back of playing at this summer 's @entity63 , @entity0 is sure the @entity66 outfit 's old potency will return			1
reflecting on the @entity18 victory , the @entity67 said : ' we were certainly delighted to start with a win			2
' i was very , very pleased and very happy we won the game			0
' of course , we will perform better and that fluidity will get better as the season goes on			0
you have to understand a lot of players are coming back late			0
' @entity13 scored 102 goals on their way to being crowned @entity12 champions last term , while runners - up @entity1 notched 101			1
their encounters during the season saw @entity13 win 2 - 1 at the @entity84 - the venue for monday 's match - before @entity1 triumphed 3 - 2 at @entity86			1
and while expecting a close battle this time around , @entity0 also anticipates there being plenty of creative attacking play in the game , even given how early on it is in the campaign			1
back in action : @entity41 is closing back in on full fitness as he takes the ball away from @entity96 rocks at the back : @entity46 and @entity99 looking serious during the session debutant ? @entity101 could play his first game for @entity1 against @entity13 asked if he thought monday 's contest would be a cagey one , @entity0 said : ' i do n't think so			1
' i think the nature of both teams is the offensive game , but of course they 're normally tight games			0
' if you look at both sets of players , there 's lots of invention and creativity in the team			2
i think both will be creative and want to score goals			0
' we know we need to be compact and solid when we have n't got the ball , and we need to be aggressive and press well			0
' we know we have the freedom , movement and pace that can hurt teams			0
we understand it 's early on , but it 'll be a good game for sure			2
' one thing @entity0 was particularly pleased about with regard to the @entity18 game was the character his players demonstrated to come through and emerge with the win			1
he feels it is down to the sense of team spirit at @entity1 , something he has been keen to emphasise that no incoming player - such as maverick @entity142 frontman @entity54 - will disrupt			1
preparation : the captain looks to get himself ready for the huge game at the @entity84 smiles : @entity147 and @entity148 look to be enjoying themselves at @entity150 one on one : @entity152 eyes up @entity41 with @entity0 watching on ping : @entity48 looks to hit one with his famous right foot @entity0 said : ' i think the atmosphere and the ambience around the team is very , very good			2
' it 's been a key marker for us			2
when people look at the team , as well as the qualities , our team spirit is very strong , and it is something that got us through the game last weekend - that character , resilience and spirit			0
' maybe early on you did n't really see that , but i think you see that now in the team - that if we are not playing so well , we still want to fight and work			0
' you do that when the team is close and the squad is close			0
ultimately that will get you results			0
" @entity54 will not be able to feature against his old club @entity13 on monday even if his proposed transfer goes through before the game as it needed to have been completed by midday on friday for him to be eligible , but there could be debuts for summer signings @entity101 and @entity34 .			1
