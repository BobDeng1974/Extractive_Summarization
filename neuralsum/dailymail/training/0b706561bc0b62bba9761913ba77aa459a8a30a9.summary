by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:28 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 14:21 est , 24 october 2013 @entity2 in @entity3 have defied public outrage to vote in favour of a bigger budget for the @entity7			1
all 12 meps in @entity10 ’s party backed an increase in @entity7 spending from a deal agreed earlier this year , despite calls from political leaders in the @entity16 for austerity to apply at home and abroad			1
it is embarrassing for mr @entity10 , who tried to claim credit for securing the budget cut , and comes ahead of @entity7 leaders meeting for talks tonight on the budget and boosting growth			1
embarrassing : @entity10 , pictured on @entity26 , claimed credit for the budget cut , which his own @entity8 have voted to reverse support : @entity30 backed the budget increase along with fellow @entity2 @entity32 @entity8 were voting on a plan from the @entity34 to spend a massive € 142billion next year , some 2 per cent more than national governments agreed in february			1
while @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 @entity8 voted against the bigger budget , all @entity2 backed it			1
while the budget will be 5 per cent lower than last year , it will still be € 855million higher than the deal secured by mr @entity43 at crunch talks early this year			0
leaders of @entity47 ’s national governments agreed on a total € 908billion budget limit for 2014 to 2020 - about 3 per cent lower than the current seven - year period			1
last night @entity8 voted on the first year of the 2014 - 2020 budget round , and voted for a 2 per cent increase on what the @entity47 leaders agreed			2
prime minister @entity43 is in @entity3 tonight for talks on curbing spending and cutting red tape the decision by the @entity2 to endorse extra @entity7 spending while defending cuts in the @entity16 appears at odds with mr @entity10 , who in february boasted : ' i spent months making the case for the tough approach that we took with politicians around the @entity7			1
' @entity67 treasury minister @entity66 said : ‘ @entity10 must explain why the @entity2 voted yesterday for an increase in the @entity69			1
‘ at a time when families in @entity16 are facing a cost of living crisis and the deficit is high , we need restraint and reform of the @entity69			0
‘ that 's why @entity8 voted against the @entity34 's proposal for a higher budget			2
and it 's why we pushed for a real terms cut last year and defeated @entity43 in a vote in the @entity83			0
’ however , the @entity2 insisted they had secured a cut to the budget - just not as big as national governments wanted			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ’ not a single @entity88 voted to increase the @entity3 budget			1
they voted to cut it by 5.4 per cent , cutting £ 8billion from @entity7 spending			2
’ @entity2 also led cost - saving measures which cut £ 24million from @entity30 expenditure , supported a cut of £ 30billion from the seven - year budget , and backed a cut of 5 per cent in staff and pension costs to save a further £ 8billion over eight years			2
’ in february mr @entity43 celebrated a major diplomatic coup in @entity3 after securing the first @entity7 spending cut in its history			2
during 26 hours of talks , the prime minister also fought off attempts , led by @entity106 , to slash @entity16 ’s rebate			0
mr @entity43 ’s deal will save @entity16 taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds on what they would have been forced to pay under the @entity112 ’s initial plans to increase the budget			0
however , our annual contributions will actually increase – because of @entity117 ’s decision to surrender a chunk of the rebate , won by @entity120 in 1984 , in return for reform of agricultural spending which never materialised			0
split : members of the @entity34 are at odds with the leaders of @entity47 's national governments over the size of the @entity3 budget mr @entity117 agreed in 2005 that investment spending in new eastern @entity47 members , which is rising as a proportion of the @entity7 ’s budget , should no longer be subject to the rebate			1
@entity7 leaders meet in @entity3 today and tomorrow to discuss ways to improve growth and competitiveness across @entity47			0
@entity3 red tape is ‘ throttling ’ @entity16 business , @entity43 has warned ahead of the talks			0
the prime minister is to push for a one - in , one - out rule , to halt the growth in @entity7 regulations			0
ahead of the meeting , @entity147 published a list of the 100 most costly @entity7 regulations to the @entity16 economy using data from the @entity16 @entity154 ’s impact assessments of these rules			0
it concludes they cost the economy £ 27.4billion a year - more than what the @entity158 expects to raise in revenue from council tax			0
in at least 24 cases , the government ’s own impact assessment finds that the estimated costs outweigh the estimated benefits - meaning that they impose a net cost on the @entity16 economy .			0

all 12 @entity2 meps defy national governments to demand 2 *%* rise in 2014
@entity173 , @entity36 and @entity38 voted against the plan for extra @entity3 spending
embarrassment for @entity10 who tried to claim credit for budget cut
