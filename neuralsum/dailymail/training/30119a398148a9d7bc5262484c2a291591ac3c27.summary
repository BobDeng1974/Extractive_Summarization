by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 15 march 2014 updated : 08:00 est , 15 march 2014 an ex-soldier , dubbed ' @entity4 's @entity3 ' , has completed an 8,000 - mile trek around the coast , taking him 18 months and raising almost £ 200,000 for the @entity8 charity			2
@entity9 , 40 , set off on august 8 2012 , from his local pub in @entity12 - @entity11 , and ran across the length and breadth of @entity4 , battling against the elements			1
he completed his journey 's final steps by sleeping rough every night , covering every strip of the @entity20 's coast			2
@entity21 ( left , centre ) was dubbed ' @entity4 's @entity3 ' because of his epic walk , which resembled the portion of the classic film which saw the hero ( right ) trek across the @entity28 during his voyage he fought the wet @entity20 weather , going through 14 pairs of walking boots throughout the trip			1
he beat the flu twice , got blisters , sickness , non-stop rain , suffered several near death experiences and had to use his army skills to survive			1
as he finished the 8,000 mile trek , he claimed he cried as he saw @entity41 appear over the horizon , which signalled the end of his voyage			0
@entity21 chose to sleep rough throughout his voyage , despite many offers of a warm bed for the night @entity21 ended and started his voyage in @entity12 , where he was greeted by many people who celebrated his accomplishments , including the town crier mr @entity21 said : ' i 've cried more in the last week than in the last decade			1
seeing @entity41 just signalled the end and it was extremely emotional			0
' everyone who has supported me on the journey throughout - following me on @entity53 , giving me a hot drink or a sandwich , cheering me on - has completely reinstalled my faith in humanity			0
' as an ex-infantryman myself , i know soldiers struggle returning to life as a civilian			0
many struggle to reintegrate into normal family life , often due to a lack of counselling and support			0
' my aim was not only to raise an obscene sum of money for @entity8 but to enhance public awareness of our homeless soldiers by sleeping as they would sleep			2
@entity21 arrives in @entity12 at the end of his 11,000 mile walk around @entity4 to raise money for @entity8 ' i suppose i am a modern - day @entity3 , but this is no @entity79 movie			1
' mr @entity21 came up with the idea when his @entity12 @entity81 went bankrupt , leaving him struggling to find work			1
he applied for more than 120 jobs , but got nothing but rejections , and was eventually left homeless and penniless			0
he set off to raise £ 10,000 for @entity8 by walking anti-clockwise around the coast from north west @entity88			1
when he finished he was greeted by the @entity12 @entity89			2
after sleeping rough for the last 18 months , he hoped to raise awareness of how many ex-servicemen and women who also end up on the streets			1
he has accepted hot meals and showers , as well as offers to wash his kit , but he always rejected the offers of a bed for the night			0
@entity21 ended up raising almost double the amount he set out to make during his trek , making £ 20,000 for @entity8 his plan to sleep rough was often made worse by constant rain , freezing conditions , coupled with landslides and swollen rivers which made it dangerous to sleep outside			1
while his original plan was to raise £ 10,000 for @entity8 , he almost doubled this with his total of nearly £ 20,000			1
@entity111 , ceo and co-founder of @entity8 said : " what @entity113 has achieved is nothing short of astonishing			0
' since @entity8 launched six years ago , the great @entity20 public has done many remarkable things , but @entity113 's walk is unique			0
' we have never heard of anyone contemplating this challenge , let alone completing it			0
' choosing to walk such a long distance over a sustained period of time - whilst sleeping rough to raise attention of homelessness - has required huge personal sacrifices by @entity113			2
' as a result of these sacrifices , @entity113 has raised an incredible amount of money which will help us provide practical , direct support to servicemen , women and veterans who have suffered life - changing injuries and illnesses			0

man slept rough and made it round the entire *coastline*
@entity21 , an ex soldier from @entity12 , used army training to survive
he raised almost double his target of £ 10,000
*intended* to raise awareness for how many *ex-army* end up on streets
