by @entity0 whether it ’s a quick dip before breakfast or a cheeky stroll along the red - light district , these tiny holidaymakers are making the most of the hot weather			0
and although @entity10 ’s little people are only 2cm tall , the world is their oyster in his latest collection of work			1
@entity10 , a @entity14 - based finance worker , spends hours scouring the internet for the miniature figurines , before setting up the surreal scenarios			1
sweet seduction : in ' @entity19 ' artist @entity10 uses @entity21 sweets to recreate the infamous red - light district and although the figurines are usually used on model railway sets , @entity10 has far more interesting jobs for the little people			1
his latest pictures show them in situations such as playing golf with hundreds and thousands and watering the gigantic bluebells			2
but it ’s not all fun and games - for these little chaps , tending to a 5 square metre garden is a mammoth task			0
the 34 - year - old said : ' i shot the latest set of photographs over the past couple of months and so i have been able to utilise things like @entity46 and @entity47 in some of the work			2
' @entity49 9 ' recreates a bloody murder scene from artist @entity53 's favourite crime series go @entity54 ! ' @entity55 ' is one of artist @entity10 's pieces using 2cm - tall figurines , which he trawls the internet to find ' it ’s nice to keep some of the work relevant to when it was made			1
' my wife and i visited @entity19 back in april and the infamous red light district was just begging to be recreated using an amusing diorama			0
' in this instance @entity66 act as the platforms from which the ladies try to entice their male spectators			0
' each scenario takes @entity10 around 90 minutes to set up and photograph			1
he started creating the miniature dioramas over 10 years ago during his @entity75 degree at the @entity76 artist @entity10 's work , humorously named , ' @entity77 could not believe that @entity79 did not like butter ' he said , ' miniature figurines have always fascinated me and i take a lot of enjoyment from thinking up new ideas about how i can use them next			2
' i always joke with people , saying that i obtained my degree by playing with toys , which on the face of it , is difficult to argue against			0
' i am a very keen landscape photographer , and i think my initial interest was born out of an effort to find a completely different style of photography to interest myself in			0
' although renowned for its humour , @entity10 ’s latest body of work has taken a more sinister turn			2
' watering the bluebells ' shows a little man hard at work atop a stem a golfer does his best with spilt hundreds and thousands in @entity10 's piece called ' four ! ' most notable is the blood - splashed murder scene inspired by the dark tv series ‘ @entity108 ’			1
@entity10 said , ' my wife and i were massive fans of the tv series @entity108 , and when it finished for good i decided to dedicate one of my miniature set - ups to the show we loved			1
' maybe the murderer in my mini-series could be called " the @entity119 " ? ' murder scenes aside , @entity10 hopes that the little people would be happy in their roles			0
he said , ' hopefully they would thank me for allowing them to fulfill their potential in the various scenarios they find themselves placed in			0
' but adds , ' or maybe they would tell me to stop being so silly			0
' ' fishing for cod ' ( left ) and ' @entity131 ... ' ( right ) put @entity10 's 2cm - high people into percpective ' sitting on strawberry laces ' : one of artist @entity10 's works , which feature little people usually used in model railways ' @entity138 ! ' features a mini @entity139 a little overgrown : ' tending to the garden ' features little people trimming sprouting cress ' @entity144 ' is one of @entity10 's surreal scenarios he 's captured on camera ' @entity148 ' is missing @entity10 's usual suspects -- his little model railway figurines ' @entity151 ' is @entity10 's quirky take on aviation ' @entity154 ' : only 2cm tall , but pretty scarey none - the-less ' a quick dip before breakfast ' shows how much fun you can have in a bowl of @entity160 - especially if you 're 2cm tall the artist has used seasonal flowers in his new series , including a daffodil in this piece , ' @entity166 ' it 's not all happy times in the world of little people			1
' ok , now give me your wallet ' depicts a mugging scene ' contemporary seats ' : what better place to perch than a sherbet - filled flying saucer ' @entity177 ' makes good use out of a pot of @entity180 the appropriately named ' @entity181 ' ' @entity182 ' is one @entity10 's spookier creations ' honey , i think we took a wrong turn ' makes life look quite fun as a figurine ' portaloo ' : an imaginative use for a box of tic tacs making a splash in ' @entity195 ' artist @entity10 's work ' made from @entity197 '			2
