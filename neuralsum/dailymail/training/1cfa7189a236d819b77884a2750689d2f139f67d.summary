by @entity0 train passengers will not get the chance to travel directly from @entity4 or @entity5 to mainland @entity6 on the new high - speed rail network , it was revealed last night			2
a £ 700million connection had been proposed between @entity9 - from where @entity11 will depart - and the @entity13 terminal at @entity14			1
but transport secretary @entity15 has said it does not offer ‘ good value ’ and would require ‘ too many compromises in terms of impacts on freight , passengers and the community in @entity23 ’			1
map : a £ 700million connection had been proposed between @entity9 - from where @entity11 ( in yellow ) will depart - and the @entity13 ( in grey ) @entity13 terminal at @entity14 mr @entity15 announced yesterday that he was removing the @entity11 - @entity32 link from the @entity33 currently going through @entity34 - and would look at other ways of linking @entity11 with the continent			1
those hoping to use the @entity11 line to get directly from the @entity39 to cities including @entity41 and @entity42 will now have to make a short walk between the two stations in @entity45			0
passengers will have to disembark at @entity9 , where the @entity11 ends , and walk 700 yards to @entity14 to catch a connecting train			1
the average person would take seven minutes to walk that distance			0
@entity11 boss sir @entity50 recommended in a report launched yesterday in @entity4 that the proposed link was ‘ sub-optimal ’			1
scrapped : transport secretary @entity15 ( left ) said the connection in @entity45 does not offer ' good value ' , and @entity11 boss sir @entity50 ( right ) recommended that the proposed link was ' sub-optimal ' he told the @entity55 : ‘ it was the right technical solution to achieve that linkage , but it was a compromise on everything it did			1
' it was the right technical solution to achieve that linkage , but it was a compromise on everything it did ' sir @entity50 , @entity11 boss ‘ we should look at what the other options [ are ] as simple as being able to get between the two stations either by @entity69 or by walking , as you do in @entity41 , or a very expensive high speed connection from further outside @entity45 to the @entity39			2
’ it comes as mr @entity15 gave a green light to ‘ ambitious ’ plans by his high - speed tsar to fast - track the £ 50billion @entity11 to the @entity39			1
and he also signalled the return of a much loved landmark - the @entity78 - demolished more than 50 years ago as part of the 1960s ‘ modernisation ’ of the station			0
acceleration : mr @entity15 has given a green light to ' ambitious ' plans by his high - speed tsar to fast - track the £ 50billion @entity11 to the @entity39 the minster backed sir @entity50 ’s plans to ‘ accelerate ’ the route beyond @entity89 by up to six years by creating a new hub station 43 miles to the @entity39 at @entity91 , which would be operational by 2027			1
he also backed plans for a much bigger revamp of @entity9 - the @entity96 terminus - than the £ 1.2billion redevelopment currently planned			2
he said he was asking @entity11 and @entity97 to ‘ develop more comprehensive proposals for the development of @entity9 ’			2
sir @entity50 had concluded the station should be subjected to a more substantial revamp ‘ that could truly stand the test of time ’ and ‘ whose effects will be felt for generations ’			0
days gone by : mr @entity15 also signalled the return of a much loved landmark - the @entity78 - demolished more than 50 years ago as part of the 1960s ' modernisation ' of the station significantly it will mean the return of a once much - loved landmark - the @entity78 - much of which is in storage			0
he said : ‘ this work should include proposals for the @entity78 which should never have been knocked down and which i would like to see rebuilt			0
’ built in 1837 , as the entrance to @entity9 , the @entity78 was demolished in 1961			0
but 60 per cent of the original stone has been located in the bed of the @entity122 at the @entity123 in @entity124 , and much of that removed intact			0
the arch is likely to be rebuilt as part of a wider development of shops , flats and amenities .			0

£ 700million connection had been proposed between @entity9 and @entity14
but @entity135 *insists* @entity11 - @entity32 link does not offer ' good value '
requires ' too many compromises on freight , passengers and @entity23 area '
