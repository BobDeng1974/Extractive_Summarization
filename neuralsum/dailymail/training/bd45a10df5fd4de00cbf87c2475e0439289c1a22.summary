to share or not to share ? that is the question			2
parents fear they could lose friends on social media and become a ' baby bore ' by bombarding @entity6 's news feed with photos of their children			1
the rise of social media has seen users share personal photos on @entity6 , @entity13 and @entity14 , but a study taken by @entity16 , an @entity18 - born social network app for parents , reveals 50 per cent of parents worry ' over-sharenting ' will annoy friends			1
despite three quarters of @entity18 parents worrying about the safety of sharing baby pictures on social media , one in 10 parents admit their concern is losing friends			1
@entity32 user @entity31 joined the social network site after realising all her baby pictures were annoying @entity6 friends despite three quarters of @entity18 parents worrying about the safety of sharing baby pictures on social media , one in 10 parents admit their concern is losing friends this follows last month 's warning to mothers who post baby pictures publicly , after @entity14 users were caught stealing newborn and toddler photos , re-posting them to new accounts , and then inviting followers to create elaborate story - lines with the children			1
the practice is called ' baby role - playing , ' and a quick search for the hashtag ' # babyrp ' has revealed hundreds of these accounts exist , with new ones popping up daily			0
the scenarios - which take place in @entity14 comment sections - usually involve one user acting as the parent or caregiver and another pretending to be the child , who 's been given a new name			1
though most of the back and forth is relatively innocent ( swaddling or feeding the baby , for example ) , occasionally the scenarios turn extremely sexual and violent			0

' our users own their content and we provide value beyond printing services and sharing photos through our focus on helping families raise their children and support their child 's development			1
' first - time mother @entity31 knows the anxiety of ' over-sharenting ' all too well			1
she told @entity117 she was taking up to 100 to 150 photos of her daughter , @entity95 , each day			0
' i copped quite a bit of slack because i posted one too many photos - waking up photos , sleeping photos , side photos , ' she said			2
' at the start everyone was really excited but eventually my friends were commenting on the photos saying " oh , another photo of @entity129 - has n't she changed since the last 48 photos you 've put up			2
" " ms @entity133 , who lives in @entity134 , @entity135 , explained her reasons for sharing pictures of her daughter was to let her family , who are not @entity135 residents , see @entity95 grow up			0
' i realised it was becoming an issue			0
i actually had people unfollow me and unfriend me , ' she said			0
losing @entity6 friends was not ms @entity133 's only fear , she held concerns for her daughters safety and made sure she would never post photos of her naked , at the beach or potty training			1
@entity14 users were caught stealing newborn and toddler photos , re-posting them to new accounts , and then inviting followers to create elaborate story - lines with the children @entity159 offered piece of mind to ms @entity133 and meant annoying friends on @entity6 would no longer be a problem			1
' when you first become a parent it is the proudest moment of your life and you feel like the whole world feels the same but they actually do nâ€™t , ' ms @entity133 laughs			0
' @entity159 is a safe community where i can post anything i want and i know that people want to see it			2
' i am on another website called @entity176 which has 4000 followers and people are constantly asking for a media outlet that lets them post photos of their children that allows their family and friends access			2
' i am fast to jump on and tell them all about @entity16			0
' but this is not something that only ms @entity133 enjoys , she said even @entity95 has an input with her @entity32 page			0
' most of the time she is quite particular about what photos are being taken of her and she says " @entity197 have we ' beans ' it ? " , ms @entity133 said			2
' she ( @entity95 ) has a very solid understanding of who gets to see it			0
' @entity32 has been established since 2012 and now has half a million users who use the social network site			1
the platform was thought of by co-founder @entity91 who wanted to find an easy and safe way to share moments of his son			0
the idea was then recognised by @entity92 and @entity211 who jumped on board to be apart of @entity16			0
