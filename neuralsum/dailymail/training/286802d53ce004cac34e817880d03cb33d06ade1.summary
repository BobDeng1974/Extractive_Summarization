and that includes @entity7 the red squirrel who is seen here taking the aerial route to collect some hazelnuts at the country park she calls home			1
soaring through the air , she aims for park ranger @entity17 ’s arm , and , on making a safe landing , scampers along her sleeve to pilfer her pockets			0
as for the pickpocketing , it ’s a trick she has learned because rangers at @entity44 , in @entity45 , carry nuts with them especially for the eight red squirrels who live in an enclosure there			1
the squirrels have even started pickpocketing visitors – although it ’s unclear how many snacks they ’ve managed to get their paws on			1
rangers have excused @entity7 ’s behaviour because they believe she is pregnant and gathering food ahead of giving birth			1
red squirrels are extinct in @entity45 but @entity61 - @entity60 , whose family has owned the estate for 200 years , has helped to establish a small conservation area for them on his land and hopes to one day release them into the wild near @entity69			1
phew : landing complete , cheeky @entity7 prepares to hunt for nuts in the ranger 's pockets getting warm : @entity7 peeks inside ms @entity17 's pockets before finding the nuts carried to feed the eight red squirrels who live in the enclosure at @entity44 in @entity45			1
red squirrels are a protected species in @entity80 , brought to the brink of extinction by their disease - carrying grey cousins			2
outside the @entity86 and @entity87 , the few remaining reds live in colonies on @entity89 , the @entity90 , @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97 in @entity98 and @entity101 ’s @entity100 nature reserve			0
they are still widespread in @entity103			0
@entity7 was born in 2011 , in the enclosure at @entity44 , which is surrounded by 20ft of sheet metal to keep out grey squirrels			2
she breeds with her partner @entity108			0
mr @entity60 said : ‘ @entity7 is the matriarchal type and was one of the first squirrels here , so she is also one of the braver ones			2
‘ all the squirrels here are used to humans and really tame			0
they know all the keepers and will happily forage in their pockets for food			0
‘ they even have a check in visitors ’ pockets despite us not encouraging them to feed the squirrels			2
