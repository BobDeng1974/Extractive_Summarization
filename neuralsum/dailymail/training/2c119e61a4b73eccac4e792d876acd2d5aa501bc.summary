by @entity0 the @entity3 administration only finalized the exchange of @entity5 for five @entity7 detainees one day before the swap took place , a top @entity1 has revealed today			1
senator @entity10 said tuesday that @entity12 officials did n't learn the pickup location for sgt. @entity5 until an hour ahead of time			1
senator @entity10 , the @entity16 's no. 2 - ranked @entity1 , presented the timeline as an explanation for why president @entity3 did n't inform @entity19 30 days before the may 31 prisoner trade			1
republicans and some @entity22 have sharply criticized the president for failing to notify them and contend he broke the law			1
@entity3 says he acted legally			2
@entity10 spoke as a @entity42 panel overwhelmingly backed a measure barring @entity12 funds for the transfer of detainees from the prison at @entity48 , @entity49 , amid the congressional outcry over the swap			2
timing : president @entity3 has stood by his decision to approve the exchange and said that the quick window was necessary to ensure the safety of both @entity5 and the @entity12 soldiers transporting him ‘ the reason for that is simple , this is a secret military mission in which disclosure of the mission could put into jeopardy not just the life of mr @entity5 but also the lives of the military , ’ incoming @entity42 press secretary @entity58 said tuesday			1
on a bipartisan 33 - 13 vote , the @entity67 added the provision to a $ 570billion defense spending bill that blocks money if the administration fails to notify @entity19 within 30 days of a transfer from @entity48 as required by law			2
the administration exchanged @entity5 , who was the last remaining @entity12 prisoner of war in @entity75 held captive by the @entity7 since 2009 , for five @entity7 officials who had been at @entity48 for more than a decade			1
the five were sent to @entity78 , where they are to remain for a year as part of the deal			2
representative @entity81 , the @entity82 chairman of the defense subcommittee , described the agreement as a ' violation of trust ' by the @entity3 administration that can not be overlooked			1
the measure also bars 85 per cent of the money in the account for overseas conflicts until defense secretary @entity92 reassures @entity19 that no funds will be spent to violate current law requiring congressional notification			0
house speaker @entity96 lamented tuesday that although he was briefed on the super-secret mission to take out @entity98 in 2011 , he was kept in the dark about the prisoner agreement with the @entity7			0
although @entity96 and other lawmakers voiced concerns when told more than two years ago about the possibility of the trade , the @entity101 @entity82 told reporters he ' was never briefed on any specific negotiation			1
' in the week since the deal , lawmakers have raised questions about whether @entity5 was a deserter and whether the @entity12 gave up too much for his freedom			1
the exchange : the @entity114 was briefed on the exchange ( pictured ) today many members of @entity19 have cited intelligence suggesting the high - level @entity7 officials could return to the @entity75 battlefield			1
particularly galling for lawmakers was a detail that emerged in a closed - door briefing monday night with administration officials that 80 to 90 members of the @entity12 government knew of the swap but not a single member of @entity19			1
@entity82 representative @entity128 ' @entity127 , who serves as the @entity114 chairman , announced after the briefing that he 'd investigate the deal			1
defense secretary @entity92 will testify before the panel wednesday			0
no such probe is occurring in the @entity1 - led @entity16 , but @entity133 representative @entity133 demanded similar open hearings			0
' it 's got to be demoralizing for our allies			0
it 's got to be demoralizing for our soldiers			0
it 's got to embolden the people we 're fighting against			0
we 're at war , ' @entity133 told reporters			0
defending the administration 's conduct , @entity10 blasted his colleagues in @entity19 for focusing on the lack of notification , even if one of the loudest critics has been a party colleague : senator @entity151 of @entity152 , who heads the @entity153			0
defense : @entity22 senator @entity151 has said that she agreed that it would be impractical to expect the president to give a month 's notice before the exchange looking for the next step : @entity82 representative @entity128 ' @entity127 ( right ) , who serves as the @entity114 chairman , announced after the briefing that he 'd investigate the deal ' are we saying that once we decided to do the prisoner transfer , we had to notify @entity19 and wait 30 days ? ' @entity10 asked			1
' the president could n't do that			0
it could have endangered the man 's life by waiting 30 days			0
' the law on notification ' does n't square with reality , ' he added			0
@entity10 said he expected public doubts to subside as people learn more about @entity5 's experience			2
' as people understand the circumstances of his imprisonment , it will help explain why the president considered this such a threat , ' @entity10 said			0
he expected @entity5 to offer his account publicly as well , although military officials are ' a little bit tentative because of his medical condition ' right now and because declassification procedures are under way			2
' as soon as he 's in good shape and stabilized , he can tell us a little bit more about his experience , ' the senator said .			0

@entity114 has been briefed about the deal and learned that top officers only heard about the deal one day before
@entity82 argue the president broke the law by not telling them a month before the exchange took place
@entity3 stands by his decision and says that the safety of @entity5 - and the @entity12 *tasked* with transporting him - was at stake
