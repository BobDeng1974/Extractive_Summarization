file picture a sukuk is an @entity6 bond			1
it generates returns to investors without breaking @entity6 law that prohibits interest			2
the essential difference with a conventional bond is that each sukuk represents a share of ownership of the asset you are investing in			2
regular bonds represent a share of debt			2
whereas normal bonds do not give the investor a share of ownership in the project they support , sukuk investors get partial ownership			2
the criteria for what you can invest in with a sukuk is limited			0
it must be sharia - compliant			0
conventional bonds which can be used for anything			0
bond holders receive regularly scheduled interest payments for the life of the bond - often at a fixed rate - and they are not affected by costs related to the asset			0
sukuk holders receive a share of the profit and accept a share of any loss incurred			0
' there are some countries which naturally look inwards , pull up the drawbridge and refuse to recognise that the way the world is changing affects their future success			0
' but @entity7 will not make that mistake			2
' the creation of a new stock exchange index listing @entity6 compliant companies is intended to attract more @entity6 investors to @entity23			1

at the same time the @entity157 is working on the issue of a bond - like sukuk , worth around £ 200 million , which could be launched as early as next year			0
it will be structured so that investors are paid a fixed return based on the profit generated by an underlying asset			0
this is in line with @entity6 principles which forbid interest - bearing bonds			1
