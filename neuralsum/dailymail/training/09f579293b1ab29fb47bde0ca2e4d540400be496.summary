‘ the @entity25 has carried out some very interesting research on this			0
one in five people in our economy can not do the four basics online of sending and receiving an email , browsing the internet , filling in an online form			1
‘ now there ’s been a lot of talk about communities who ’ve been disconnected from our global economy and those of course were a lot of those who were voting for @entity4 in the local and @entity16 elections			1
