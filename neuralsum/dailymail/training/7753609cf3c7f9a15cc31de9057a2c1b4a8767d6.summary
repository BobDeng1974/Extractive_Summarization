by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 06:07 est , 18 january 2013 older people are increasingly turning to e-readers and tablets to indulge their love of literature , according to research they may be developing their own shades of grey			1
but @entity10 ’s older generations are far from technophobic when it comes to reading			1
nearly one in three over- 55s now owns an e-reader , research reveals			1
mums , dads , grannies and grandads are increasingly demonstrating that while technology is widely regarded as the domain of the young , in fact digital books are replacing or supplementing traditional ones in the homes of savvy seniors			0
many are discovering there ’s nothing quite like settling down in front of a nice warm @entity31 , or putting their feet up with an @entity33			1
according to research by @entity36 consumer analysts , 29 per cent of those aged 55 and above now own a digital book reader , compared with just 22 per cent of the younger generation			2
older women embracing the digital age are particularly fond of the devices , with 31 per cent owning one			1
that may also have something to do with @entity45 , the publishing phenomenon which began life as an e-book			0
the findings fly in the face of assumptions that only youngsters can conquer the complexities of technological wizardry , or that oldies would never abandon proper books			0
@entity57 , of @entity36 , said : ‘ over- 55s are the keenest readers across all formats of books ( paperback , hardback and digital ) – bar audiobooks			1
‘ the popularity of e-readers in this age group is related to the fact that the digital book is designed specifically to cater for an activity in which they are the keenest participants			2
’ or , to put it another way , e-readers probably appeal to granny because she can enlarge the text , and will never lose her place in a book again			2
but do n’t get the idea that the older generation is fearlessly spearheading a silver surfer revolution			2
one in four admits to needing a youngster to teach them how to use new technology			0
kindle technology has evolved dramatically since its launch in 2007 and owning a smartphone ? that , apparently , is a whole new chapter			0
‘ the majority continue to have no immediate need for one , ’ mr @entity57 said			0
@entity91 launched the first successful e-reader , the @entity92 , in november 2007			0
it used a low power ‘ e-ink ’ display that had no visibility problems in sunlight			0
the technology has since evolved and many tablets , such as the @entity31 , combine an e-reader with the ability to play music and films and browse the internet .			1

nearly one in three over- 55s own an @entity33 , @entity31 or similar
older women even more likely to enjoy tablets and e-readers
generation *'s* love of reading could be behind spike
