@entity0 , the conservative firebrand and new media pioneer who died suddenly at just 43 , had told friends he was poised to take his jihad against the @entity4 deeper into the mainstream media with a regular show on @entity7			1
last weekend , @entity0 told friends he was in early talks with @entity7 about a crossfire - style show in which he would argue from the @entity10 alongside former @entity13 @entity12 representative @entity11 taking him on from the @entity4			1
such a show could have been a blockbuster			1
in what was perhaps his finest hour , @entity0 was the man who ended the political career of @entity11 by revealing that the married congressman he had sent lewd photographs sent to young women via @entity22			1
@entity0 , left , told friends he was in talks with @entity7 to co-host a show with @entity11 articulate , outspoken and - before his fall from grace - a darling of the @entity4 , @entity11 was one of the few liberals who might have given @entity0 a run for his money			1
it would also have been a dramatic move for @entity7 , which previously brought in disgraced @entity33 , who resigned as @entity35 governor after his trysts with a high - end prostitute were revealed , for a show that was subsequently dropped			1
separately , @entity0 had been asked last friday by @entity40 screenwriter ans producer @entity39 about how he might be portrayed in @entity39 's new @entity42 series @entity43 , about the inner workings of a cable news network			1
@entity39 had also recently spoken to @entity0 about portraying him in @entity39 's new show @entity43 @entity39 told me via email : ' i e-mailed @entity0 last friday because the episode of the newsroom i 'm currently writing takes place during the week the @entity11 photos were in the news			1
' @entity0 and i had struck up a friendly e-mail relationship and so i reached out to ask him if he could give me a timeline of the events from his point of view			1
i got a quick response - ' i 'm in ' - and we were supposed to meet for coffee at the end of the day today [ thursday ]			2
' @entity39 said that the coffee would have been ' about @entity0 shedding any new light on the @entity11 incident ' and ' we 'll likely see shards of @entity0 during his various appearances that week ' in news footage from that time			1
confidants of @entity0 say he had some reservations about a @entity7 show but would probably have signed up for it			1
he was intrigued by the notion of a show with @entity11 , believing it could be a vehicle for real discussion of ideas			1
@entity78 , spokeswoman for @entity7 , said that @entity7 had no comment			2
i first met @entity0 in 2007 , when he was still working in relative obscurity for the @entity81			1
engaging and irrepressible , he had a passion for taking on liberals and delighted in doing so from his native @entity85 , which he viewed as the belly of the beast			2
working from the basement of his home in @entity90 , he would post stories on the @entity81 that would be read by millions and help shape the media narrative			2
in each pretty much each corner of virtually every room was some kind of @entity97 device so that he would always be connected to the world outside			2
he was proud that the house was right next to the @entity100 , where many @entity13 troops were buried and military funerals were often held			2
he told me that his real estate agent had told him the proximity to the cemetery meant the house was worth less but to him it increased its value			2
this reporter last saw i last saw @entity0 this past saturday in @entity108 , @entity109 when he was appearing at the @entity111 conference after he had uncharacteristically slept in until 10am although he saw the mainstream media as the enemy , he understood it and knew many of its main players			1
this enabled him to use the media , sometimes from with , as well as oppose it			2
i remember him telling me that the internet had been invented for him because is provided an outlet for his @entity121 , with which he had been diagnosed			2
shortly afterwards , @entity0 burst onto the national scene , leaving @entity81 to set up his @entity124 websites			1
almost overnight , he became a conservative megastar			1
the next time i saw him in @entity85 was last september , when we met for drinks at @entity129 in @entity130 with mutual friends			2
by this time , one of the weapons he used to fight the @entity4 was @entity22			2
as he approached , wearing a t - shirt from a @entity136 group he had spoken to , he was walking and tweeting			2
although he could come across as an angry figure , particularly when on the defensive on television , the reality was that @entity0 loved life and had an immense capacity for humour and mischief			1
adopted by a secular @entity146 couple , he had grown up holding conventional political views ( his natural father was an @entity149 musician ; he knew who his birth parents were but had no interest in meeting them )			2
despite his fearlessness , he was also a sensitive soul and a very affectionate husband to @entity157 and father of four			2
he gloried in his battles , re-tweeting the vilest things said about him to shame and expose their authors			0
but he told me that he had wondered about the effect of his public persona when his son had been upset relating how a school friend had said to him : ' my father says that your father is evil '			0
@entity0 had joked that after the occupy protests he 'd shaved his face and cut his hair shorter but @entity0 was happy to have made a hundred new friends for every friend he had lost because of his new celebrity as a right - winger			1
that night , he recounted how he had received an agonised - and completely unsolicited - email from a college friend who had explained at great length why he could no longer be his friend			0
@entity0 laughed at the presumptuousness of the whole thing and how he had replied with two words : ' oh well			1
' he also said that night that he had recently gone to the hospital emergency room with a tightness in his chest			0
when a nurse had ' freaked out ' at how high his blood pressure was , he had responded : ' do n't tell me that - you 'll make it even higher			0
' @entity0 had looked overweight and stressed that night			1
i and the others with us told him he needed to ease up on his insane travel schedule and he talked about trying to exercise more , taking downtime with his family and getting a personal assistant to take charge of his diary			0
but he always seemed to be on @entity22 , on tv , on the phone or on a plane - and sometimes seemingly two or three of these at once			0
a few months ago , he set up a part - time base on @entity203 , spending time in @entity205 working out of a wonderfully kitsch historic house decorated by a rich @entity207 and right next to the @entity208			0
i last saw @entity0 on saturday in @entity108 , @entity109			1
he was appearing at the @entity136 - linked @entity111 conference , where @entity210 and @entity211 also spoke			0
that morning , he had uncharacteristically slept in until 10am and there had been a panic about where he was			0
tragic death : @entity0 leaves behind a wife and four children loving father : @entity0 had suffered heart problems a year earlier during his speech , however , he was on vintage form , describing @entity222 as ' the metronome ' and his allies as ' the alligators '			1
he declared proudly : ' i 'm out there fighting with the metronome			0
i 'm out there fighting with the alligators			0
' at another point , he said : ' i 'm fighting these people as hard as i can			0
' he urged conservatives to ' stop acting like @entity235 ' in denouncing those who backed @entity237 candidates who might not pass this or that purity test and said it was essential to get behind whoever was the nominee			0
as usual , he was extremely funny , joking about how he had shaved his stubble and cut his hair after occupy people said that ' i look like a bum '			0
in describing an anti-republican media narrative designed to divert attention from unemployment and gas prices by highlighting social issues , he said : ' i have four children			0
i took care of the thing down there			0
contraception 's not in the top two billion things in my world			0
' he branded @entity261 ' race card television ' and that if a conservative said ' gymnasium ' on television , the response would be : '' gym ' originates in antebellum @entity267			1
you 're all racist ! ' the next day , he took a car to @entity271 airport with filmmaker @entity272 , another speaker and a close friend			0
as he got in , he told her : ' i feel awful			0
' she put it down to a hangover			0
in the car , they discussed @entity39 - on friday night , he had shown her the email from @entity39 - and the prospect of a @entity7 with @entity11			0
@entity0 felt that such a @entity7 show would rehabilitate @entity11 but he wanted to ensure it would be serious and would involve going out and talking to real people as well as back - and - forth in the studio			1
they talked about @entity285 , which @entity0 felt was stuck in the past with too many blonde presenters and outdated formats			1
one of the journalists he admired most , he said , was @entity290 , who worked for him as @entity124 and is now also @entity7 contributor			0
he described her as a ' warrior princess ' , effective because she was cool and modern			0
@entity0 thought that the @entity4 feared people like @entity290 most because she was an attractive , engaging , hip person who did not fit the stereotype of dour , fusty conservative			1
essentially , the same thing could have been said about him			0
one of @entity299 's central arguments was that conservatives had allowed themselves to be excluded from popular culture - film , television , music , even art. he was a central figure in the largely undercover world of @entity40 conservatism			0
at the end of his speech in @entity108 , he said that conservatives would have to endure the race card and the ' fairness ' card being played against them in the coming election			0
they 're at war with you and the very idea that you 're still here shows that the @entity136 mindset is alive and kicking			0
' who would have thought that the fiercest and most formidable conservative warrior of all was about to leave the battlefield			1

show would have been *comeback* for *ex-congressman* forced to quit after campaign from conservative firebrand @entity0
