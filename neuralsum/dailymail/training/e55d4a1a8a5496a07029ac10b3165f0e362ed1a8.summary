by @entity0 published : 14:55 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 19 february 2013 @entity1 stormed it yet again with an epic show on @entity5 's so - called @entity4 that was nothing short of exquisite			1
the @entity7 chief creative officer always stages spectacular theatre - and this season was no different			1
to the sounds of @entity13 's @entity11 @entity10 opened the show , modelling a tan leather skirt that told of the camels and rich chestnut browns tones to come			1
@entity18 walked next , in a cheeky translucent rubber pencil skirt and heart top that embodied the spirit of the collection : playful , saucy and a little bit kinky			1
i swear i saw @entity25 give a wink from his perch up on the memorial plinth next to the stage when she sauntered out onto the catwalk , staged in a gleaming glass box among the trees in @entity34 , wearing the see - through skirt , with nothing but a pair of heart - print knickers underneath			1
it was a naughty but nice look that set the scene for what was a show of contrasts that gently subverted the long legacy of this heritage brand			1
@entity47 's most infamous showgirl and political mistress was referenced in the show 's title - trench kisses : a collection of classics and @entity53 - setting a mischievous tone for the hint of sexiness - and wickedness - to come			1
scroll down to watch the show in full subverting tradition : @entity18 walked second in an outfit that embodied the very spirit of the show - vinyl skirt with heart - print knickers beneath that managed to be at once both prim and kinky ' i like the idea of taking something that has gravitas , this 158 year old brand , but making it subversive and kinky , ' @entity1 said afterwards			1
that translated as traditional fabrics and classic shapes given edge with vinyl , patent leather and metal			2
glossy gold collars topped corset dresses , trimmed the collars of coats and formed gleaming belts that encircled slender waists , cinching in wool and cashmere			0
with the launch of @entity7 's new beauty range , those shimmering gold collars and embellishments were intended , @entity1 said , to cast their light onto the models ' faces and really make them glow			1
and they did ( though having 22 - year - old models with the skin of a radiant cherub helped , i 'm sure )			0
but while there was plenty of sauce and a fair few pairs of knickers on show , this was by no means a gimmicky collection			1
colours were iconic @entity7 tones : red , white , camel , oxblood , black and gold			1
@entity112 , dozens of them , and each more darn covetable than the last , streamed endlessly down the catwalk			0
there was black wool , leopard print mink and camel ; oxblood leather , vinyl , python print ; tan suede covered in amorphous gold metal plates , leather - fringed with metal eyelets , studded with dozens of gold rings , heart - print calfskin , laminated leather , laminated jacquard ... traditional with a twist : classic with a touch of the @entity130 in this mink @entity133 coat luxe : a mink gabardine trench with gold belt , accessorised with the studded crush bag @entity139 calfskin trench : ' i wanted to clash the contrasting worlds of sweet and sexy ' , @entity1 said golden girl : @entity18 modelled a metallic collar @entity1 said was intended to cast light on to the models ' faces to make them really glow iconic : a red corset dress with oxblood trim was in typical @entity7 tones classic : a trad camel coat was given edge with gold metal eyelets and a shimmering metal belt return of the kitten heel ! @entity18 and the rest of the models wore low , pointed kittens for a prim walk @entity18 's navy double - breasted coat with its wide lapels and gold belt was stand - out , as was a creamy camel number with gold eyelets , teamed with a fringed leather bag in oxblood			1
only a true fashion insider could have all the words necessary to tell of the veritable army of styles that we saw - but i can tell you there were trench coats , cabans , @entity179 , @entity181 greatcoats and cropped bikers ... and that was just for starters			0
@entity185 by @entity13 @entity186 ( acoustic version ) by @entity188 hold me by @entity189 the theme of the show made for a playful yet provocative vibe , @entity1 said backstage afterwards			1
' it 's sassy , sexy			2
i like the idea of an inverted world			0
there 's traditional trench coats mixed with rubber , ' he said			2
or little sweethearts under rubber skirts			0
' it 's the idea of these two worlds clashing			2
something sweet contrasting with something sexy			0
@entity206 and established with something sassy and naughty			0
there 's an air of elegance , but underneath there 's this kinkiness			2
' @entity1 said his models were actually quite prim - providing a backdrop that allowed him to add a touch of sauce with the styling			1
' i put the girls in these kitten wedges so they had quite a prim walk , ' he said			0
' but then i put them in these vinyl skirts , patent leather , rubber , metal			0
something to make the heart race			0
' and race it did - no more so than during the epic finale , when a stage opened at the back of the catwalk and the haunting voice of rising @entity233 star @entity189 's @entity234 soared to a crescendo accompanied by a cello , the piano and a heavenly choir			1
the benches vibrated and a moved crowd simultaneously developed goosebumps from head to toe			0
@entity243 - a man not often moved to tears one might suppose - declared the show ' emotional ' , while @entity1 himself said he almost had a little weep during the pre-show run - through , so powerful was the setting and the music			1
if it all sounds a little hyperbolic , i 'll just say you had to be there			0
the spectacular staging of his shows is certainly no accident			0
the man who never rests says he is already thinking about the production for his @entity259 , which wo n't take place until september			0
' usually at the end of a show i 'm thinking about the next one , ' he says			2
' i 'll go back to the office now and write them down			0
' ' music is so important to the shows			0
because shows are all about entertainment and they 're about emotion , and about making people feel something			0
' ' people have to feel it in the fashion , but also in the lighting , the music , the atmosphere			0
it 's a combination of all of those things			2
' in what is a world first , the items are already up on the @entity7 website available to pre-order until 3 march - and worth a look if only to perv upon the items up close			1
@entity287 to burberry.com now to check it out			0
