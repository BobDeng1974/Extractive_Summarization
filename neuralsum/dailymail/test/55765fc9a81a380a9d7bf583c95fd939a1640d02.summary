some of the oldest surviving photographs of the @entity1 and @entity2 , dating back more than 150 years , have been found			1
the remarkable images were shot by photographer @entity4 , who developed the negatives in an improvised dark room on board his punt which he sailed along the @entity9			1
and despite being more than 150 years old , most of the images capturing the iconic landmarks along the river are instantly recognisable today			2
while a picture taken from the banks of the @entity9 of @entity2 , showing @entity4 's floating dark room in the foreground , is remarkably similar to contemporary pictures of the iconic building			1
another shows the @entity1 in the 1850s when @entity39 was prime minister , and is strikingly similar to photos taken today			2
the pictures are to be sold as a collection at the @entity43 and are estimated to sell for around £ 30,000			1
@entity4 travelled around the @entity9 on his boat to capture images of the well known landmarks , developing them on the spot his floating dark room construction is often seen tethered to a skiff in some of the photographs			1
as an artist and photographer was renowned for his panoramic pictures , captured along the stretch of the @entity9 - featuring images from the @entity1 to @entity57 in @entity58			2
he was commissioned to take the collection of pictures for @entity61 of the @entity9 : from its rise to its @entity64 , by @entity65 and mrs @entity66			2
the photographer was known for his panoramic images , such as this one taken overlooking the @entity9 , of @entity28 @entity28 today is busier than the scene surrounding the 18th century stone bridge captured by @entity4 around 150 years ago the buildings and riverside of @entity73 was captured in a photograph taken by @entity4 , who then developed his pictures as quickly as he could today 's picture of @entity73 - with the church spire dominating - bears a striking resemblance to that taken by @entity80 , more than 150 years ago the images , such as this of @entity83 , were saved by @entity4 in his book of pictures of the @entity9 in the mid 1850s and will now be auctioned some of the photos capture how the areas have changed , such as at @entity83 where the watermill no longer stands after it was burned to the ground in 1908 , having survived for almost 800 years @entity4 's photography along the @entity9 included this shot of @entity93 in the 1950s , with his darkroom boat in the foreground ( right ) @entity93 has been significantly developed since the 1850s when @entity4 captured his image of the @entity99 suburb along the @entity9 the photos - believed to be the the first documented collection of the @entity25 's greatest river - were eventually published by @entity4 's father 's publishing company , @entity103 , in around 1862			1
only a handful of copies of the photographs are known to exist , with most in specialist collections			0
the last to appear at auction was at @entity110 in 1981			0
each of the photographs captured a historical record of the area at the time - with some also showing how changes have occurred in the last 150 years			0
at @entity83 , a watermill built during the 12th century , was a focal part of @entity4 's image			0
but in photos from today the mill is absent - after it was burned to the ground in the early 1900s			0
@entity4 's image provides a historical record of the construct , which produced malt , barley and corn for almost 800 years			2
but most of the photos show how little things have changed - such as the photos of the houses of @entity132 and @entity133			0
an image of the houses of @entity132 and @entity135 , taken by @entity4 , is believed to be one of the oldest photographs @entity4 's picture of the @entity1 is thought to be the oldest surviving image of the landmark , which looks similar today a black and white photograph of @entity142 features in @entity4 's groundbreaking photo album of panoramic views of the @entity9 @entity142 is in full view overlooking the @entity9 in an image taken from the exact same spot today as the one several years ago the images capture how @entity99 's landmarks appeared in the nineteenth century , such as at @entity150 , as he travelled past @entity73 lock and weir lies on the @entity9 today after being built in 1773 and captured by @entity4 almost 100 years later the collection will be sold by @entity154 and @entity155 , at the @entity58 book fair , held on april 25 and 26 , for £ 28,500			1
last month an image taken by @entity4 of young men playing cricket at @entity160 was discovered and at 150 years old , was believed to be the earliest ever photograph of a school cricket match , and the second oldest of any cricket anywhere			0
the image , which showed men playing in waistcoats , was signed in pencil by @entity4 and taken just five years after the first ever image illustrating the sport			0
this was captured by @entity171 in 1857 , a founding member of the @entity173 and famous for his photographs of the @entity175			0
@entity4 's photo captures the calmness at @entity178 - which connected @entity179 with @entity180 in @entity181 today @entity178 is still a calm stretch of waterway on the @entity9 , with most traffic now crossing @entity185 instead snapshots in the collection , including this of barges in @entity58 , will be sold when it is sold at the @entity43 for around £ 30,000 the busy waterways in @entity58 , pictured in 2009 , bear a striking resemblance to the bustling river captured by @entity4 150 years earlier the incredibly rare collection of photographs taken from @entity99 to @entity58 is to be sold and has an estimated value of about £ 30,000			1

@entity197 created a makeshift dark room on board a boat he used to travel along stretch of the @entity9
@entity4 captured images of iconic landmarks in the 1850s , such as the @entity1 and @entity2
images are oldest surviving documented record along the river and are remarkably similar to those of today
