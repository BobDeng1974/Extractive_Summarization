by @entity0 if you ’ve ever marvelled at the wonder of hand warmers – those hard flat packs that heat up when you bend them - then this video will amaze you			1
a scientist from the @entity8 , @entity9 , is filmed putting his hand in a jar of hot ice , or molten sodium acetate , so it crystallises around his fingers			1
in a matter of seconds , the man 's fingers are coated in a thick layer of ice			2
but instead of being cold , the scientist explains that his hand is actually quite warm , ‘ like a hot bath ’			1
frozen : the scientist 's hands are coated in a thick layer of hot ice , or molten sodium acetate			1
because the ice is in fact warm , he is able to shake the crystals off ‘ hot ice ’ is created using sodium acetate , which is a salt created from the reaction between sodium bicarbonate , or baking soda , and acetic acid , or vinegar			1
when this reaction occurs , sodium acetate appears to freeze like ‘ ice ’ as the cold solution turns from liquid to solid			1
this process is exothermic , meaning that the solid structure is warm to the touch			0
solutions of sodium acetate are used in certain types of hand - warmers			2
when a metal button is pressed inside the plastic pouch containing the solution , it releases chemicals that starts the reaction			0
this causes the solution to crystallise , and this reaction generates heat			0
eventually he ’s left with a block of ice stuck to his hand , but he ’s able to break free because the crystals are still soft , ‘ like ice cream ’			0
explaining the process on @entity70 channel @entity69 , the scientist , who does not give his name , said : ‘ this works because the substance is not " ice " as in water , but a different substance called sodium acetate trihydrate			2
‘ normally solid sodium acetate was melted into a liquid that was then supercooled to below its melting point			0
‘ in this state , adding nucleation sites , like the crystals on my hand , rapidly causes the rest of the sodium acetate to crystallise			0
’ the incredible video has been watched almost three million times			0

a scientist from the @entity8 placed his hand in hot ice
hot ice is made from molten sodium acetate during an exothermic reaction
in seconds the scientists hand is *covered* by thick layer of this solid ' ice '
but as the ice is warm ' like a hot bath ' he is able to free his hand
molten sodium acetate is also used in plastic hand warmers
