the shocking @entity1 ‘ catcalling ’ video which went viral internationally last week has been recreated in @entity2 with extremely different in a stark contrast , the model is mostly ignored by passers - by during her five hour experiment			1
in the original video , aspiring actress @entity9 was filmed walking through @entity1 for 10 hours , and was subjected to 108 catcalls and even followed by several overly - persistent men			1
she was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments , including : ' what 's up beautiful ? ' , ' hey baby ' , ' sexy ' and ‘ damn , girl ! ’			0
it appears that @entity2 are far more polite , as model and yoga instructor @entity18 was treated respectfully during her five - hour experiment on the streets of @entity22			1
although she did received glances from admiring passers - by , who stopped or turned around to watch her , she was not confronted or harassed nearly as severely as the original video			1
in her social experiment , ms @entity18 did not receive the same wolf - whistles , nor were suggestive comments yelled at her , and she was only approached twice which were both in polite circumstances			1
@entity46 , 24 , had suggestive comments yelled at her while she walked around @entity1 , dressed modestly in jeans and a high - neck t - shirt , ms @entity18 , dressed in a tracksuit , was left to her own devices			1
@entity50 were behind the latest experiment , filming ms @entity18 ’s journey discreetly with a go - @entity53 although she does attract glances , she is only disturbed twice ; once by a man asking for directions and the second time by a man who apologises for interrupting her			2
the man who interrupts ms @entity18 is clearly taken with her , walking past her before turning around to introduce himself			0
although she does attract glances , she is only disturbed twice ; once by a man asking for directions and the second time by a man who apologises for interrupting her the man , who ‘ sounds @entity66 ’ according to the subtitles , jogs down the street to tell @entity9 that she ‘ looks nice ’			2
it may be interpreted as sinister , but the video makes it clear that he apologises for stopping her			0
in a stark contrast , ms @entity9 is followed down the street by a man for more than five minutes , pestering her with comments like ‘ you do n’t want to talk ? ’ , ‘ if i give you my number will you talk to me ? ’ when the video was posted , @entity1 - based @entity9 explained her involvement in the awareness campaign by saying , ‘ everyone has a right to feel safe			1
’ ' this happens daily to so many people			0
we do n't put up with harassment in school , at home , or at work , so why should we have to put up with it on the street ? ' the @entity50 explain that they shot the footage to try and measure the level of street harassment that women experience in @entity22			2
@entity50 were behind the experiment , filming ms @entity18 ’s journey discreetly with a @entity98 they define street harassment as ‘ sexual comments , catcalls and whistles from male strangers ’			1
ms @entity18 says that she found @entity2 men to be polite and that it was a refreshing change after her experiences living in @entity1 for five years			1
" it was nice , it was a change from @entity1			2
people were actually quite polite , " she told @entity50			0
" i did n't feel uncomfortable at all			0
" the @entity1 experiment has received more than 33 million views			1
the @entity2 appropriation has had more than 600 thousand clicks in three days			2
the set off a storm of outrage since it was released tuesday			0
rape threats have since been directed toward @entity118 , the woman in the video , according to multiple reports			1
the footage , which was shot and edited by @entity122 , was captured by a camera @entity122 had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of @entity9 , who was dressed in jeans and a t - shirt and walked silently along			2
unwanted attention : @entity9 appeared in the original video , which showed the catcalling she experienced over a ten - hour period on the streets of @entity1 speaking about the experience of making the video , @entity9 told @entity135 ' i felt like crying and i have occurrences in my past of sexual assault , so i was n’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me			1
i was just going over in my head and reliving , unfortunately , these memories while i was walking			2
i wanted to break down in tears			0
' @entity145 , executive director of @entity146 ! , the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video , told the @entity149 ' it ’s hitting a nerve			0
certainly , people are coming out of the woodwork and saying some really offensive and misogynist things			0
' we ’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against @entity158 and we ’re pulling those down as quickly as possible , but they exist			1
that ’s scary and i think what they ’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this			0
and both of us are saying no , we need to talk about this because if we do n’t talk about this , if we do n’t get this story out , then none of this is going to change			0
' hidden camera : the footage was captured by a camera @entity122 had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of @entity9 , who walked silently along @entity122 told @entity135 ' i ’m getting some blowback , but not nearly as bad as @entity158			1
right now she ’s getting a lot of threats and things like that and it ’s just so sad			0
it ’s like the video is now being echoed in real life			0
' at no point did @entity9 make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them			2
that did n't stop the comments from coming			0
when she did n't respond , one man told her , ' somebody 's acknowledging you for being beautiful			0
you should say thank you more ! ' stalked : one man walked next to @entity9 for five minutes as she walked through @entity1 another criticism was that some men 's comments seemed innocuous : ' good morning , ' ' have a nice day			1
' ' some men could have been ' genuinely being nice , ' @entity199 , a @entity200 resident who readily acknowledged street harassment exists and has seen it happen to women in his family , told the @entity206 said he thought the video shed light on a bigger problem , ' but some people just genuinely want to say hello			2
' that 's the problem with street harassment , may told the wire service , because when there 's a fear that a simple good morning could escalate into sexual comments or actions , there 's a reluctance to engage at all			0
everyday : @entity9 said the number of comments she received on the streets the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her			1
