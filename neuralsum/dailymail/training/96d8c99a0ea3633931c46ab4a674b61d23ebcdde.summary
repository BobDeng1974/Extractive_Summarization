by @entity0 and @entity1 first lady @entity3 's healthy eating initiatives have been so unpopular among young people that more than a million students have stopped buying school lunches			1
the @entity7 set new standards for what types of foods schools can serve students that have been phased in over the last three school years in response to @entity3 's push for healthier school lunches , and even more changes are coming in 2014			1
already , data from the department shows that a total of 1.1 million children abandoned the @entity21 between the 2011 and 2013 school years after @entity3 went to war over what 's on their trays			1
and among students whose meals are not subsidized by the government , the number is even higher - totaling 1.6 million			2
not having it : first lady @entity3 's healthy eating initiatives have been so unpopular among young people that more than a million students have stopped buying school lunches if only @entity3 's regs on school lunches were as popular with kids as her dance moves were yesterday during the first - ever @entity38 first lady @entity3 joins the lunch line at @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 on january 25 , 2012			1
@entity3 made the visit to speak about the @entity7 's new nutrition standards for school lunches in announcing the changes to school lunches in january of 2012 , @entity3 said that , ' schools are finding that when they actually offer these healthier options , kids are n’t just willing to try them , they actually like them			1
that 's the thing , that 's the surprising thing			0
' i 've been to so many schools across the country where parents see their kids eating fresh vegetables off the vine , kids they say would never try anything , but that 's the beauty of children — they change , ' the @entity3 said			1
but since then many schools have had success putting the rules in place , others have said they are too restrictive and costly			0
the rules set fat , calorie , sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond			1
schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for whole grains have proven particularly difficult , while some school officials say kids are throwing fruits and vegetables they are required to take in the trash			1
' i am talking to the lunch ladies who do all this work and it is thrown in the garbage at the end of the day , ' @entity88 rep. @entity87 told @entity94			0
@entity96 @entity95 are proposing to let some schools opt out of healthier school lunch and breakfast programs if they are losing money			0
a @entity102 spending bill for agriculture and food programs released on monday would allow schools to apply for temporary waivers if they have a net loss on school food programs for a six month period			2
the @entity110 said in a release that the waiver language is in response to requests from schools			0
the @entity116 , which represents school nutrition directors and companies that sell food to schools , endorsed the provision on monday and said that schools need more room to make their own decisions			0
president @entity125 said the group supports the one - year waiver as a temporary solution until @entity129 considers renewal of a school foods law that expires in 2015			1
' school meal programs need more flexibility to plan menus that increase student consumption of healthy choices while limiting waste , ' @entity125 said			0
the @entity116 says that almost half of school meal programs reported declines in revenue in the 2012 - 13 school year and 90 percent said food costs were up , leading 1,445 schools to quit the program			2
nutrition advocates and other supporters of the rules say it will take some time for schools to adjust and the @entity96 proposal is overly broad			0
@entity151 of the @entity152 says the @entity96 @entity95 are using a ' hacksaw rather than a scalpel ' to try and solve problems some schools are having			0
@entity151 argues that there may be other factors in play such as enrollment or food costs if a lunch program is losing money			0
' it 's a shame that the @entity96 @entity95 are taking a step backward and allowing schools to serve more unhealthy food to children , ' she said			2
' why would @entity129 , already maligned for labeling pizza a vegetable — and i know something about pizza — now seek to weaken federal child nutrition programs , and through the appropriations process no less , other than to appease the industry ? ' @entity170 rep. @entity169 said on tuesday			0
the latest round of regulations handed down by the government requires public schools to serve more whole grains , fruits , and vegetables and less sodium and fat in announcing changes to school lunches in january of 2012 , @entity3 said that , ' schools are finding that when they actually offer these healthier options , kids aren ¿ t just willing to try them , they actually like them			1
that 's the thing , that 's the surprising thing			0
@entity129 passed the @entity197 , @entity196 in 2010 just before @entity170 lost control of the @entity96			1
the legislation places stricter regulations on what foods schools can and can not serve students at lunch and in vending machines on school property			1
@entity170 passed the legislation as part of a plug for @entity3 's @entity210 campaign			2
getting kids to eat healthier , and at school in particular , has been a major part of the @entity3 's initiative			2
' with more than 32 million children participating in the @entity21 and more than 12 million participating in the @entity219 , good nutrition at school is more important than ever , ' the campaign 's website says			1
' @entity210 is committed to providing healthier foods in our nation ’s schools , and encourages all schools to provide school breakfast			2
' ' the first lady has from day one made the health of our children a top priority , and that means keeping the pressure on to ensure that school nutrition standards already implemented by 90 percent of our schools stay intact , ' @entity227 press secretary @entity226 said on tuesday			2
' @entity238 and this administration believe that every decision we make should be guided by sound science and hard evidence , not politics or special interests , particularly when it comes to the health of our children			0
' the latest round of regulations handed down by the government requires public schools to serve more whole grains , fruits , and vegetables and less sodium and fat			1
' as parents , we try to prepare decent meals , limit how much junk food our kids eat , and ensure they have a reasonably balanced diet , ' @entity3 said at a 2012 event announcing of @entity7 's new guidelines on school lunches			1
' and when we 're putting in all that effort , the last thing we want is for our hard work to be undone each day in the school cafeteria			0
' the @entity270 's spending bill does not include the @entity102 's one - year waiver			0
instead , republicans in the @entity270 will go after new limits on sodium in school lunches and the amount of whole grains schools have to serve			1
if the @entity102 's legislation passes in either chambers , it would be a big blow to @entity3 and her healthy eating campaign , which has been unpopular among students			2
' i blame @entity3 , ' a student told the wire earlier this month			0
' it 's great that schools are trying to make lunches better , they 're not doing a very good job of it			0
' starving kids at school is n't exactly a way to ( get ) kids ' obesity down , ' the student said			0
the new rules are already showing wear and tear as student dissatisfaction with school meals rises			0
on tuesday the @entity7 announced a two - year waiver of its own for schools having trouble meeting new regulations on whole - grains			1
@entity310 public school students sick of the smaller portions and healthier offerings they get at lunch thanks to @entity3 's anti-obesity initiatives are sounding off on social media some students who less than thrilled about the new guidelines are blaming @entity3 directly for their unappetizing school lunches			1
