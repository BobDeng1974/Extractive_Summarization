the small blaze is understood to have been in a room at the @entity9 end of the building in the early hours of this morning			1
sources said there was no significant damage but areas were being cordoned off because of the potential danger from toxic substances such as asbestos			1
blaze : areas of the houses of @entity3 were closed off this morning after a fire areas including the commons chamber were off - limits to members of the public as a result			1

mps would be forced to relocate to a replica chamber if the plans to overhaul the @entity33 go ahead			2
it would be the first time that the @entity36 has been left empty since the @entity37			0

the worst problems are linked to subsidence caused by decades of tube trains rattling past the foundations and work on the underground car park			0

cracks have also started to appear in the walls of the @entity59			0
the problem is so severe that mps are even being asked to consider the radical proposal of selling off the historic building and moving into newly built offices – a move that could net £ 500million for the exchequer			2

they include building a new parliament , temporarily evacuating for refurbishment or continuing with decades of limited repairs during the summer holidays			2
