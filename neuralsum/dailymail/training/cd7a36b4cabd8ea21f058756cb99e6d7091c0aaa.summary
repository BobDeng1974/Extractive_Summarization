@entity6 , 22 , has started a petition to lower the age of screening from 25 back to 20 and has so far collected 7,000 signatures			1
once the student from @entity12 collects 10,000 she will take it to @entity14			0
petition : @entity6 wants routine smear tests to be offered from the age of 20 in @entity18 like it is in @entity19 @entity6 , who has a four - year - old daughter @entity20 , was diagnosed with the cancer two years ago			1
she had a hysterectomy to remove two tumours , which gave her the best chance of survival			0
ms @entity6 decided to become a nurse after battling with the disease and hopes , once qualified , she will be able to care for people in a similar situation			1
' having been through the illness myself , i want people to understand how important the issue is and that people my age can get cervical cancer , ' she said ' up until the age of 18 , girls can have the hpv vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and then at 25 routine screening starts - but in between those ages there ’s nothing to prevent or detect the disease			2
' @entity6 , who had a hysterectomy , said : ' i am so lucky that i already have my daughter ' the mother of one said she went to her gp after showing symptoms of the disease and it was confirmed by a smear test			1
' if i ’d have waited until 25 then i probably would n’t be here now - which is terrifying , ' she said			0
' when i went into hospital to have my hysterectomy the nurses and carers on the ward were absolutely brilliant and it was then that i decided i wanted to become a nurse			1
' i know i ca n’t have any more children but i am so lucky that i already have my daughter and i look forward to becoming a nurse and caring for people who are battling similar illnesses			2
' once @entity6 has collect enough signatures , she hopes to cycle the 100 mile trip from @entity71 to @entity72 to deliver the petition and raise money for charity			2
she said : ' i urge people to sign my petition and help make a difference			0
changing the screening age could save lives and that ’s worth a few minutes of anyone ’s time			0
the age for routine cervical screening was raised from 20 to 25 in @entity18 in 2003 after a review concluded that screening under - 25s would do more harm than good			0
@entity19 and @entity89 still do routine smear tests at 20			0
