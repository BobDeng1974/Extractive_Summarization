by @entity0 normally the drama happens on the stage , not in the wings			0
not so in @entity4 , where opera director @entity5 has swapped the leading lady in his production of @entity9 's epic opera @entity8 just three days before opening night			1
@entity11 singer @entity10 has been dismissed in favour of @entity14 soprano @entity13 , who flew in to @entity15 from @entity16 only yesterday to take over the role of princess @entity18			1
@entity10 has been replaced by @entity14 soprano @entity13 in the @entity4 production of @entity9 's epic opera @entity8 the decision was made during the final rehearsals , and an official @entity4 statement explained it was based on a ' mutual ' belief that the role of @entity18 would ' not be right ' for @entity10 's @entity4 debut			1
the last minute swap follows a spate of disruptive cast changes : @entity10 was herself a replacement for original casting of @entity18 , @entity31 soprano @entity30 , who was forced to leave the production in june when she fell pregnant			1
@entity13 on stage at the @entity4 in @entity34 by @entity35 and directed by @entity5 in april the role of princess @entity37 will now be played by @entity13 , right , on all nights in @entity4 apart from the final two , 18 and 21 decmber , when @entity40 singer @entity39 will take over part the opera is a supernatural romance set within the courts of medieval @entity45			1
@entity13 will play @entity46 on all performances apart from 18 and 21 december when he role will be performed by @entity40 @entity39 , herself a newcomer to the @entity4			2
the @entity4 explained : ' after much deliberation and consultation following the final rehearsals of @entity9 's @entity8 , it has been agreed between the @entity4 and soprano @entity10 that the role of @entity18 would not be the right part for her debut at @entity4			1
' the @entity4 considers @entity10 an important voice of the future , and we are keen to build a continued relationship with her			2
' however , voices do develop , and we have to recognize that this role is not ideally suited for her now more dramatic voice			1
' despite all efforts until the last minute by all parties to make it work as well as possible , it has been mutually agreed that @entity10 will not appear in @entity8 and will postpone her @entity4 debut			2
' the @entity4 is proud to announce that it has been agreed that she will return in 2015 in her celebrated role of @entity69 in @entity70 boh√®me , and another important role is under discussion for the future			0
' as well as the commotion surrounding the role of @entity18 , @entity74 withdrew from her part as @entity78 due to a medical condition , returning later when no alternative could be found			0
@entity13 took the role of @entity82 in the @entity4 production of @entity34 by @entity35 , directed by @entity5 , in april this year @entity5 's production of @entity9 's opera opens on thursday and runs until 21 december after a number of unhappy people commented on the website about then change , specifically asking why @entity13 had not been chosen to replace @entity30 back in june , the @entity4 added : ' we are sorry that the cast change causes disappointment			1
' @entity13 was n't originally available to replace @entity30 , as she was not available for the rehearsal period , but we are extremely grateful to her for having jumped in with such short notice immediately after ending her last engagement in @entity95			2
' we do of course take full responsibility for believing wholeheartedly in this casting six months ago , and i am sorry that the change now has caused disappointment and irritation			0
' we still are very excited about @entity10 's voice , and we look very much forward to presenting @entity10 as @entity102 - a role she has received much deserved acclaim for - and are discussing another significant role with her , as stated above			1
' as for @entity4 having many last minute cast changes , i do agree that we have been particularly unlucky in the last year with too many cast changes , most of them due to illness or other circumstances beyond our control			0
' we are very sorry for this , and i do assure you it is something that we never announce with a light heart			0
we will do all we can to prevent this and hopefully will have fewer cast changes in the future			0
' comments on the @entity4 website reveal that fans have mixed feelings about the last - minute cast change ... ' i am shocked and very disappointed			0
this is a very big mistake			0
it is sad that people of @entity15 and around the world will not hear miss @entity10 in this roll [ sic ] this year at your house ! ! ' @entity131 ' i hope all this annoying cast changing will not influence the planned future dvd release that is announced on the website			2
this fantastic opera needs more attention and more respect during preparation ! ' sgett ' this is very sad news to me ... i have heard @entity10 sing and am very sorry the people of @entity15 will not have that opportunity			0
