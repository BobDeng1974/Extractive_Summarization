arrested : @entity0 was put under arrest for his gyro - copter stunt and charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace the postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the @entity10 @entity9 is facing two criminal charges			1
but he 's being released from federal custody to return to @entity14			1
@entity0 made his initial appearance in @entity16 in @entity17 on thursday			1
that 's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the @entity9 's @entity20 after flying through restricted airspace around the @entity22			1
he was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace			1
@entity0 said it was a political protest			1
@entity0 was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in @entity29 starting next week			1
in a soft voice , @entity0 appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant			1
homeland security secretary @entity35 said thursday that the copter ' apparently literally flew in under the radar , ' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why			1
@entity35 said it 's too soon to say whether wednesday 's incident should prompt changes in security procedures			1
' i want to know all the facts before i reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future , ' he said			2
but lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security , especially amid revelations that the pilot , @entity14 postal worker @entity0 , was interviewed by the @entity56 almost two years ago			1
the agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat , said rep. @entity60 , @entity61 , the senior @entity62 on the @entity63			2
@entity60 spoke thursday with the @entity56 director			1
' i think that there 's absolutely a gap , and it 's a very dangerous gap , with regard to our airspace , ' @entity60 said			1
' i do n't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere			2
suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle ? that could have been a major catastrophe			2
' how 'd it happen ? homeland security secretary @entity35 said thursday that the copter ' apparently literally flew in under the radar , ' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why approach : the small gyro - copter ( circled in red ) lands on the @entity20 of the @entity9 in @entity17 as members of the public walk by			1
the stunt has n't cost him his freedom , yet , but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial @entity35 said the @entity56 passed along the information from the interview with @entity0 , who was to appear in court thursday afternoon , to ' all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies			1
' @entity99 minority leader @entity98 , @entity100 , called the incident ' stunning			2
' ' what safeguards can we use ? we do n't want to be a place where we 're saying ` this is an iron - clad @entity9			1
' and have such restrictions on people having access to it , ' @entity98 told reporters			2
' nonetheless , we have to ensure the safety of those people			2
' the tiny , open - air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone , but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from @entity120 , @entity121 , right up to the @entity9			1
@entity0 has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics , and deliver letters to all 535 members of @entity129 on the topic			1
' we are a democracy			2
we do n't have fences around our airspace , so we 've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings , ' @entity35 told reporters on @entity141			1
' and so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this , but then again , you do n't want to overreact , either			2
' still , lawmakers questioned why , if authorities had been in touch with @entity0 , no action was taken to stop him			1
practice run : @entity0 flies his gyrocopter near the @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity14 prior to his ' insane ' stunt on wednesday before @entity0 made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the @entity10 @entity9 grounds , he blogged about his intention to undertake the ' non-violent demonstration			1
' though , it may have been a demonstration years in the making			2
in a post dated september 2013 on the democracyclub.org , a writer called @entity164 wrote : let me say first – this is a non-violent demonstration			2
i have no intention of hurting anyone – i have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone , including me			2
there is no way i can prevent over-reaction by the authorities , but i have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows			2
when i took off , i was over an hour away from the no - fly zone			0
the demonstration is about restoring democracy			0
corruption in @entity17 has robbed the @entity10 citizens of the representative government that is our birthright			1
polls show that the public is aware of the problem and very concerned , but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality			0
as a result of this flight , two things will happen			0
) first , we ’re going to change the narrative – the story			0
voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot - button issues and come together on a single issue			0
@entity129 wo n’t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business			0
lobbyists , special interests , unions			0
we have to make this happen			0
the political parties wo n’t			0
lobbyists love the status quo			0
the mainstream media ( not the local media ) is making a financial killing with mega-elections			0
it ’s up to us			0
second , in every @entity129 race in 2016 , i want every candidate to take a stand on corruption			0
after this flight , we ’re going to define exactly what reform means – set a written standard – and it ’s that standard which candidates will have to endorse			0
or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position			0
the candidate who only wants to talk ‘ reform ’ but wo n’t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform			0
that may be in the primary or the general election			0
giving you a choice is our job			0
the clear choice , establishment or reform , will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races			0
you get to choose ( that ’s your job as a voter			0
) but for the first time in decades , you will have a meaningful choice			0
what do i want from you ? look over your options on the previous screen or the ‘ @entity266 ’ on the sidebar to the right			0
rootstrikers or @entity268 or @entity269			0
my favorite group is n’t listed there – it ’s my own startup group : ‘ the @entity274 ‘			0
find a group ( or groups ) that you are comfortable with and sign up			0
we ’re not after money – we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed			0
protest flight : @entity0 took off from an undisclosed location in @entity17 and landed his gyro - copter on the @entity281 of the @entity10 @entity9 building ' my concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response , ' said rep. @entity288 , @entity289 , chairman of the @entity290			1
' these small aircraft or @entity293 devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage , so that 's something we 're taking a look at , ' @entity288 said , adding he might hold hearings on the issue			1
@entity300 and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media			0
@entity35 defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over @entity17 , federal buildings and monuments			1
' we 've got a well - coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission , ' he said			2
he said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask , ' what 's a gyrocopter ? ' it 's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar			1
unlike most larger aircraft , a gyrocopter does n't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft , its altitude and heading			2
even without a transponder , radar can detect ' primary targets ' - planes , flocks of birds , rain and other objects			0
but how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors			0
the landing on the @entity9 grounds ' just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier			1
it 's very hard to hermetically seal airspace , ' said @entity345 , a @entity346 aeronautics professor			1
evidence : the illegally landed craft was piloted by @entity14 mailman @entity0 to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform evidence : the illegally landed craft was piloted by @entity14 mailman @entity0 to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform			1
