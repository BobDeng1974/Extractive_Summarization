' @entity0 was in @entity57 , @entity58 , campaigning for @entity18 minority leader @entity59 when he attempted to make his presidential aspirations , or lack thereof , crystal clear			2
there , he also decried almost every major foreign policy decision @entity8 has made as president , accusing him of ' misjudging @entity66 's intentions and ambitions , misunderstanding what would happen if we did not support moderate voices in @entity71 and get them armed , misunderstanding what would happen if @entity74 did n't have a status of forces agreement with @entity10 troops staying behind to help support the @entity74 military			2
' in @entity16 , the place of @entity0 's birth and the state his father @entity82 served as governor , the former presidential nominee pleaded with his audience to elect @entity17 to the @entity18 in november in order to place a check on president @entity8			1

@entity0 has said for months that he does n't intend to seek his party 's nomination to the presidency for a third time , but ambiguous statements about how ' circumstances can change ' and comments from wife , @entity154 , about what it would take for @entity0 to enter the race next year have left fans of the @entity1 politician hoping he 'll give it another go after all			1
the @entity162 may have doused even more cold water on @entity0 's alleged 2016 plans this week when it reported that @entity0 and @entity154 were permanently relocating to @entity165 be closer to their son @entity166 , who owns property adjacent to the land they 've been building a 5,900 square foot home on for the last year and a half or so			1

@entity0 's last two presidential campaigns were run out of @entity42 , where he currently resides , by longtime aides - many of whom worked for him since his time as governor			1
