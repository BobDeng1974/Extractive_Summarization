this did not have quite the same snarling intensity to match the @entity3 derby at @entity4 last week but @entity5 showed enough devil against their @entity8 rivals to prove that again they are serious @entity10 players			1
@entity11 took the field with the intention of repeating their autumn victories over heavyweights @entity16 and @entity17			2
but they finished dominated , defeated and floundering against the ropes as @entity5 hit them with wave after wave of muscular attacks			2
when @entity26 scythed through @entity11 ’s tired defence with two minutes left to score the home side ’s fourth try , and secure an important bonus point , @entity25 ’s men could reflect on a job emphatically done			1
@entity26 scores a late try for @entity5 to add a bonus point to an already impressive win @entity11 's @entity35 ( right ) beats his opposite number @entity37 to run in the first try of the match @entity35 slides in for a five - pointer after an intercept , which was converted by @entity42 just as they did in the @entity43 against @entity44 a fortnight ago , @entity5 demonstrated an unstinting determination to complete the mission			1
the @entity47 will come again but this was a sound lesson for their youngsters			0
‘ it was pleasing to get that last try from @entity26 because i thought he was outstanding , as were a lot of people , ’ said @entity5 head coach @entity25			1
‘ we ’ve got threats all over the park and we ’re in a good place			0
we ’ve not won anything in 2014 but the one thing we are doing is getting better			0
i ’m delighted with the intent we showed			0
’ @entity5 ’s victory was again built on the cornerstone of an immensely impressive forward display — with @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 the pick of a very good bunch — which enabled their hugely gifted backline to cut @entity11 to ribbons			1
four tries to two was the least the home side deserved , with both the visitors ’ scores coming as the result of forced mistakes rather than any creative brilliance			0
@entity47 winger @entity35 points to a message on tape on his wrist , which reads ' mum ' @entity5 's @entity84 winger @entity83 eases over for the hosts ' first try of the match @entity11 centre @entity88 drives @entity5 's @entity90 back and forces the prop to lose the ball much as @entity11 ’s highly promising threequarter line attempted to pick holes in @entity5 ’s defence , they were starved of possession and overpowered with ball - in - hand			1
time after time they coughed up possession in the first half and despite some bullish charges from centre @entity88 , the @entity10 ’s third - placed side at kick - off made few inroads			0
@entity11 director of rugby @entity106 , whose side lost at @entity109 last week , said : ‘ i ’ve got no complaints about the result , although i ’m disappointed with the amount of ball we turned over			2
‘ yes , it ’s back - to - back defeats but we ’ve had two away games during a tough period			0
that result wo n’t decide if we win the @entity10			0
’ as is customary , @entity120 pulled the strings for @entity5 , with centres @entity122 and @entity124 playing flat to the line and cutting clever angles as the back three of @entity37 , @entity83 and @entity26 went looking for work with enthusiasm and intelligence			1
@entity130 @entity67 tackles @entity47 ' @entity131 during their @entity10 clash the @entity47 ' @entity134 winger @entity133 crosses for his side 's second try to level the scores at 14 - 14 @entity133 celebrates his try but @entity42 's conversion of the five - pointer was the last points for the @entity47 @entity142 had the ball in hand as @entity5 pushed over for a third try it would have been a travesty if @entity5 had not claimed a bonus point			1
@entity37 had a first - half try correctly ruled out for a marginally forward inside pass from the outstanding @entity122 and they spent the past 20 minutes almost permanently camped in the opposition 22			2
when @entity26 finally sealed the bonus point , which could prove invaluable come the end of the season , @entity5 ’s dominance was complete			1
@entity83 , @entity122 and replacement lock @entity142 scored @entity5 ’s earlier tries , while @entity133 and @entity35 both took advantage of mistakes to briefly give the visitors hope of an upset by levelling at 14 - 14 after 46 minutes			1
but @entity5 ’s superior strength and depth told			0
after @entity142 drove over with 53 minutes on the clock , and fly - half @entity25 added a penalty , head coach @entity25 was able to bring on rugby league convert @entity166 for an 18 - minute cameo			2
the 18st powerhouse had little chance to make an impact but his cult status at @entity172 is assured , judging by the reaction of the 13,349 capacity crowd to his entrance .			0

@entity5 *clinched* bonus point win and kept second place with win
@entity11 were third coming into the match and could drop to fourth
@entity83 , @entity122 , @entity142 and @entity26 scored tries for @entity5 while @entity120 kicked four conversions and a penalty
@entity11 tries from @entity35 and @entity133 converted by @entity42
@entity5 have now won seven in a row in all competitions
