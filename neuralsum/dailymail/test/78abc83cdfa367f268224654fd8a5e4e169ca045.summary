they 've steamrolled past top - four rivals @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 in their current six - game @entity6 winning streak , and @entity8 are looking to make it seventh heaven when they travel to table - toppers @entity11 on saturday			1
ahead of the blockbuster clash at @entity15 , the @entity8 squad were pictured travelling down to @entity16 on friday afternoon			1
led by captain @entity19 the @entity18 ' contingent commuted via @entity20 to the @entity22 capital			1
@entity19 ( left ) and @entity23 were among the @entity8 stars who made the trip to @entity16 via train on friday ahead of this weekend 's @entity6 clash at @entity11 @entity28 ( left ) or @entity29 ( right ) could start up front for @entity8 vs @entity11 on saturday @entity8 boss @entity31 faces a number of selection dilemmas ahead of their clash against the @entity36 it was earlier revealed that the 29 - year - old striker may have to revert to a midfield role against the @entity36 after @entity40 and @entity41 were two of four @entity8 players ruled out of the clash due to injury			1
however , @entity45 is able to call upon the services of in - form midfielder @entity47 who is returning to the home of his former club for the first time on saturday			2
@entity47 , who won three trophies in two - and - a - half successful seasons at @entity53 , posted a picture via his @entity56 account as the @entity8 players boarded the train on friday afternoon			1
accompanied with the caption : ' i got back to @entity16 a few times , but this one it 's different ... big game , lots of memories , great day of football ! ... @entity67 vs # @entity8 ' @entity8 's no 8 was all smiles as he gears up for what promises to be emotional return to west @entity16			1
alongside the injuries of @entity40 and @entity76 , @entity8 duo @entity73 and @entity74 were also absent from the train ride - with the quartet all suffering injuries following @entity8 's 4 - 2 win over bitter rivals @entity4 on april 12			1
the club 's injury setback means that @entity84 and @entity28 could both be recalled against @entity86 ’s side			2
and the latter was all smiles alongside @entity89 as they travelled down to @entity16 on friday			1
@entity28 is one of several selection dilemmas that @entity45 and assistant boss @entity91 have to make for the trip against @entity11 ; in what the @entity93 described as ‘ the worst scenario ’			1
@entity40 ( left ) limped off against @entity4 while @entity74 picked up an injury soon after @entity45 also revealed in his pre-match press conference that @entity41 ( left ) and @entity73 are out @entity19 ( right ) has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back into midfield @entity45 ( left ) puts his arm round @entity8 captain @entity19 during training this week @entity45 ( left ) has revealed that @entity19 may play in holding midfield role against @entity11 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 : @entity103 ; @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity84 ; @entity19 ; @entity47 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity23 ; @entity28 ‘ i have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that ’s not so good for us , ’ said @entity45			1
‘ we had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it ’s not like that			2
@entity40 is out and @entity74 is out , but also blind and @entity73 , ' the 63 - year - old said at @entity8 's pre-match press conference on friday			1
‘ that ’s the worst scenario because @entity74 and @entity73 are good players at the left central defender position			1
@entity121 is suspended so we do n’t have many choices			2
@entity76 and @entity40 could play the midfield holding position and i do n’t have any other option , or i have to play @entity19 in that position again			1
i have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow			2
‘ other players can take profit of the momentum now			2
it ’s always like that			2
it ’s not special in the life of a manager or a team			2
‘ you have seen that i took @entity73 off pitch ( against @entity4 ) because of injury , you have seen that @entity40 was off the pitch , you have seen the tackle of @entity142 against @entity76			1
only @entity74 is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match			1
‘ it ’s because of the distance between the matches			2
@entity76 and @entity73 were very close to playing but it was not enough			1
‘ other players can take profit of the moment now			2
it ’s always like that			2
it ’s not special in the life of a manager or a team			0
’ @entity45 addresses the media ahead of @entity8 's crucial @entity6 clash with @entity11 on saturday @entity84 has n't featured under @entity45 recently but should return to play at left back @entity47 ( right ) is closed down by his @entity8 team - mates during a training session on friday @entity108 will be hoping to continue his impressive form against @entity11 on saturday evening @entity108 ( centre right ) is embraced by his team - mates after scoring against rivals @entity4 last week sports analysts @entity165 predict that a @entity11 win is easily the most likely outcome at @entity15 asked if @entity84 could return for the first time since being substituted in the @entity170 defeat to @entity171 last month amid concerns over his fitness , @entity45 replied : ‘ maybe you shall see tomorrow [ saturday ]			1
@entity84 is fit enough i think			0
he has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and i do n’t like that			0
but we train and i think he is fit enough			0
’ with @entity11 holding an eight - point lead and a game in hand over third - placed @entity8 , @entity45 believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title			1
he also claimed that @entity86 will be happy with a draw			0
‘ it ’s still possible , i ’ve said that before , ’ he added			0
‘ it is not logical but it is possible			0
it ’s more when and if , and i do n’t believe in when and if			0
the fact is that we are behind @entity11			1
‘ but , alright , we have to play against them and so do @entity171 so we can lay pressure on @entity11 ’s shoulders			1
you never know , you ’ve seen it in previous @entity6 seasons			1
so i can not say it is not possible , but it is not logical			0
‘ they play at home but i think that @entity11 will be satisfied with a draw			1
of course they will want to beat @entity8 and we want to beat them , the question is how long players can play in the discipline			1
@entity29 ( back right ) has only been training with @entity8 for a week but may return to feature ‘ we live for these titles , we are doing this for that			1
the only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title			0
when you are second or third you can play @entity213 , but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it			0
that ’s why managers are fixated on titles			0
when you reach that goal you are happy			0
‘ to be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal , that is also a goal of mine			0
that is why i ’m still a manager because i do n’t have to work anymore – you can count on that			0
i like to work with young people and help them in their career			0
’ @entity45 gave a young @entity86 his break in coaching at @entity233			0
asked to compare the @entity235 with his current assistant @entity91 , the @entity8 boss admitted that he has been surprised by the @entity239 legend ’s work ethic			2
he said : ‘ it ’s always difficult			0
people compare with each other because @entity86 was not the world - class player that @entity91 was			0
so that ’s the same thing with me			0
i was not as world - class as , for example , @entity247 yet our ambition is maybe then higher			0
‘ but i have to admit that i could not imagine when i spoke with him ( @entity91 ) in may or june to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it , that he works very hard			0
as an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker , and he reads the game very well like @entity86			0
but to manage a group you have to work , and what i can see is that he ’s learning quickly			0
’ @entity105 celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at @entity239			0
