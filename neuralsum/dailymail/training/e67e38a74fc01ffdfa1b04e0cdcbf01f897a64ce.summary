@entity0 crouched on the @entity2 turf , shirt pulled taut over his head after a match which probably ended @entity7 ’s title challenge and the chance of an ‘ absolute dream come true ’ for the @entity10			1
@entity11 coaxed his team - mate to his feet , waving away tv cameras honing in on his despair and @entity16 draped his arm around @entity0 and ushered him off the pitch			1
these images may have prompted some mickey taking but they showed how much he is cared for by @entity7			2
this is a club that stuck by him when he was a pariah of football after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity25 and nibbling at @entity27 ’s arm			0
they have supported him completely and @entity30 has cajoled the best from the striker on the pitch			0
down and out : @entity0 crouches on the @entity2 turf after @entity7 threw away their lead hiding away : @entity11 guides @entity0 away after @entity7 's costly draw at @entity36 consoling : @entity0 was desolate after @entity7 effectively handed the @entity37 to @entity38 slumped : @entity0 and @entity7 must hope @entity38 slip up over the next two games but there is also the sense that @entity0 has repaid the debt with his blistering form and goals this season and is now entitled to look for a new challenge , most likely at @entity47 or @entity48			1
a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity50 at @entity51 last week and the squandering of a 3 - 0 lead at @entity36 on monday night will only fuel the speculation that one of the world ’s best players could be heading for a club where he perhaps has more opportunity to establish himself as a great of the game			1
there were rumours that @entity0 was heading to @entity64 even before @entity7 ’s title challenge began to unravel			1
@entity47 president @entity66 is thought to have set his sights on luring @entity0 from @entity68 to @entity64 just as he did with @entity69 last summer			2
@entity0 will have watched the @entity70 excel at the @entity71 and be rewarded with a @entity73 final later this month and a battle against @entity48 and @entity75 for the @entity77 title			2
calm before the storm : @entity0 scored his 31st @entity37 goal of the season to put @entity7 3 - 0 up before it all went wrong : @entity0 celebrates with team - mate @entity82 at @entity2 main man : @entity0 has been in blistering form this season but could be a summer target for @entity47 @entity0 signed a lucrative new deal in december to keep him at @entity7 until 2017 but if they were to sell this summer , the club could expect to triple the £ 22.8m it cost to bring him from @entity90 in 2011			1
@entity0 , from @entity91 , in northwestern @entity10 , could be tempted by a return to a @entity64 - speaking environment			1
next month he will link up with his compatriots to prepare for the @entity95			0
four members of the current @entity10 squad play in @entity64 - three for @entity75 and one for @entity98 – and will no doubt extol the virtues of @entity64 life and football			2
@entity0 claimed just last week that he was happy at @entity7 but the way the @entity37 trophy has slipped from their grasp has clearly deeply affected the 27 - year - old			1
he recognises that this could be the best chance @entity7 have to win the title over the next few years against the financial might of @entity38 and @entity50			2
dream link up : @entity0 has been courted by @entity47 and could team up with @entity69 ( right ) @entity111 's best : @entity0 would surely relish the chance to play alongside @entity113 at @entity47 big time : @entity47 are in the @entity73 final and fighting for the @entity77 title with his first half goal at @entity2 on monday , @entity0 equalled the 38 - game league record of 31 goals held by @entity121 and @entity113 , despite missing the first five games of the season through suspension			1
he is @entity127 football ’s hottest property and his stock is the highest it ever has been			0
@entity0 completed his remarkable turnaround by being named the @entity131 award this week			0
the last three winners of the award have all left their clubs at the end of the season			0
@entity136 exited @entity137 to join @entity140 rivals @entity138 in 2011			0
@entity141 moved up to @entity142 after leaving @entity143			0
most recently @entity69 jetted off to @entity47 from @entity138			0
the danger for @entity7 is that their star man ’s head will be turned , just as soon as it reappears from under his shirt .			0

@entity0 broke down *crying* after @entity7 's *incredible* 3 - 3 draw at @entity36
@entity10 striker 's *reaction* and despair will *inevitably* fuel talk of a *transfer* to @entity47
@entity0 has *achieved* *brilliant* stats this season , with 31 goals and 12 assists in the @entity37
