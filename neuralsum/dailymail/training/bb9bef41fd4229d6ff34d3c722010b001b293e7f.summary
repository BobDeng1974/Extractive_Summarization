by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:36 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 08:52 est , 6 april 2013 child heart surgery is to be resumed at @entity3 amid claims of a ‘ shambles ’ over the decision to suspend operations on safety grounds			1
parents , mps and campaigners have demanded to know how the troubled unit came to be closed over safety concerns – only to re-open within a week			1
some claimed the decision had been ‘ reckless ’ – while the @entity16 and trust bosses maintained they were forced to act after seeing data that suggested death rates were double the national average			1
children 's heart surgery is set to resume at @entity3 after days of uncertainty over its future			2
it was closed last week after figures emerged suggesting high death rates but last night worrying new evidence emerged of the problems at the unit			1
all child operations at the @entity33 unit were halted on @entity34 following the release of @entity16 figures suggesting its death rate was double that of other centres , and a ‘ constellation ’ of issues			1
but a decision was reached at a summit between @entity43 , @entity44 and other organisations on thursday to aim to re-open the unit early next week			2
treated at @entity33 : @entity47 , right , was saved by surgery after doctors said they should abort her			1
@entity50 , right , had a heart defect and died after an operation at @entity33 for a heart defect some parents of children treated at the unit , as well as mps and campaigners , have welcomed the news			1
but others said questions still needed to be answered about the problems at the unit			0
@entity64 , 28 , and @entity65 , 37 , say they were left ‘ devastated ’ by the way they were treated at @entity33			1
the couple were told by doctors at the unit that their longed - for baby daughter had such severe congenital heart disease that they had no choice but to abort her			1
conflict : sir @entity77 's decision to close the unit came just 24 hours after mrs justice @entity79 ruled further consultation was necessary @entity3 is at the centre of a long - running row over the future of children 's heart services at the hospital			1
the @entity16 announced last july it wanted to close three units and keep seven open , the idea being to concentrate specialist services in fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for child heart patients			0
those currently chosen to stay open are at @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and two @entity101 centres			0
facing closure are units at @entity105 ’s @entity104 , @entity101 ’s @entity106 and the @entity33 site			2
this means patients in @entity110 would be being forced to travel to @entity97 or @entity98 for treatment - a 150 or 200 - mile round trip respectively			0
there is huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the @entity110 and nearly 600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit , oragnised by the group @entity119 ( @entity119 )			1
last month , a high court judge derailed plans to close the unit because of the ‘ secretive ’ approach of @entity16 chiefs			1
mrs @entity125 backed claims by @entity127 that the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals were kept secret			0
last week , she ruled the decision was ' unfair and legally flawed '			0
but within 24 hours , sir @entity77 , medical director of @entity44 , had travelled to @entity33 to suspend congenital heart surgery after data emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average			1
he said the figures were among a ' constellation of reasons ' behind the suspension			0
miss @entity64 – who was 26 weeks pregnant – was told ‘ not to @entity147 ’ her baby ’s condition as it would n’t be helpful			1
when the couple ignored this advice and looked up the condition on the internet , they were shocked to discover that there was in fact an operation that could help			0
miss @entity64 then emailed every hospital in @entity44 specialising in complex heart conditions – and the @entity158 in @entity98 said they could offer the surgery			2
their baby daughter @entity47 was born there on march 5 and given open heart surgery four days later			1
she will need further operations but she is now a healthy one - month - old			0
miss @entity64 said : ‘ we felt like a piece of meat on a conveyer belt			0
it did n’t seem like they were talking about my little girl – they kept calling her the foetus			0
’ but when they went to @entity98 , medics had a totally different attitude , she said			0
‘ they gave us hope			0
i just want to advise other expectant mothers to always seek a 2nd 3rd 4th opinion			0
’ @entity180 , 39 , is among those calling for a full investigation into deaths at the hospital			0
she lost her only child , seven - year - old eve , last march after an operation at @entity33 to rectify a congenital heart defect			1
after @entity190 ’s death , miss @entity50 complained to the hospital about her daughter ’s care , including why the operation was delayed until @entity186 was seven , when the average age for such a procedure is apparently four			2
she also says she was not fully briefed on either the risks involved , or exactly what went wrong during the surgery			0
responding to the news that the unit is to resume operations she said : ‘ it seems back - to - front to me to announce it will re-open before they have had assurances that the unit is safe			2
this is too important to be rushed			0
’ @entity208 , @entity208 mp for @entity209 , who has campaigned to keep the unit after its closure was recommended in a nationwide review , called on health secretary @entity213 to launch an investigation into how the hospital ’s closure had been handled			2
he said : ‘ i ’m afraid the communication from @entity44 has been woeful and the handling has been deeply questionable , and indeed the motivation behind the decision in the first place is something that i think people want to get to the bottom of			0
’ parents had criticised the timing of the unit ’s suspension , which came just 24 hours after a high court judge ruled that a decision - making process to close it as part of an @entity44 - wide reorganisation of services was ‘ legally flawed ’			1
@entity234 , of the @entity235 , which ran the campaign to save children ’s heart surgery at @entity33 , said : ‘ many children are reliant on the @entity33 unit for urgent or on - going treatment , so the sooner normal service can be resumed , the better			1
’ but @entity243 , chief executive of the @entity244 , said families needed full disclosure on the investigations that had taken place because they were still ‘ very worried ’ about their children and frightened about raising concerns			2
she said parents who had raised concerns in public had been subject to harassment and bullying			0
the hospital is at the centre of a long - running row over the future of its children 's heart services @entity262 , deputy chief executive and chief operating officer of @entity44 , said : ‘ the risk summit concluded that surgery could restart at the beginning of next week , subject to independent validation of the clinical data and an external review of clinical governance processes			1
‘ we expect this work to be completed over the next few days and a conclusion reached early next week			0
’ a spokesman for @entity43 said : ‘ we can not comment on individual cases but we would be very happy to talk to families if they would like to contact the hospital to discuss any concerns			2

unit forced to close last week after data emerged showing high death rates
questions have since been raised about *reliability* of *mortality* data
local mps criticised ' hasty ' decision to close the unit
raises ' serious concerns ' over the judgement of those who made decision
a couple claimed doctors at the unit wrongly told them they should abort their baby because it would be too sick to survive – only for them to discover the problem could be treated elsewhere ,
a mother told how her daughter ’s life was saved by heart surgery – after doctors at @entity33 had claimed ‘ nothing could be done ’ for her ,
a mother whose seven - year - old daughter died at the unit died last year demanded a fresh investigation into her case .
