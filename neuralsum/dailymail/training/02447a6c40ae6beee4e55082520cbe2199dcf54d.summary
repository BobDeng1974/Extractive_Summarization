by @entity0 published : 18:23 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 04:05 est , 10 march 2014 it ’s amazing how quickly things change in football			2
last season @entity5 was @entity6 ’s hero but now he looks like he ’s had his nose put out of joint			1
i ’ve seen it before with players who are the main man and all of a sudden somebody takes their place			1
it seems to affect strikers more often because they have a greater sense of hierarchy			0
trudging off : @entity5 is substituted at @entity19 on saturday contrast : celebrating @entity6 's title win with @entity22 last season ( left ) and being hauled off by @entity24 last season , it was all about @entity26			1
he was @entity22 ’s golden boy but under @entity24 it ’s been a different story			2
@entity6 have been in poor form and so has the @entity30			1
@entity33 ’s new contract shows how much the club value him and , little by little , you can see the confidence seeping away from @entity26			1
i am not suggesting he is a bad player			0
he is a sensational footballer and he was no 7 in my list of the top foreigners to grace the @entity40			0
but , at 30 , @entity26 is not getting any younger and , if he is still not happy by the summer , i would n’t be surprised if @entity6 decide he is surplus to requirements			1
main man : @entity26 knows he is behind @entity33 ( centre ) in the pecking order pushing for a start : @entity47 ( centre ) scored in the 3 - 0 win at @entity50 straight - talking @entity51 after a result like @entity53 had at @entity54 , it was refreshing to see a manager come out and talk with such honesty			1
when @entity53 manager @entity59 spoke after the game , you could see how much the performance was hurting , and how much it meant to him			1
it was almost as if he could n’t help himself			2
he is a real football man , he speaks from the heart and he just gave his honest view of the performance			2
some people do n’t like that passion and you very rarely hear managers take on their players			2
there is a risk you might alienate the dressing room and @entity59 might have gone a bit far , but sometimes that ’s what happens in the heat of the moment			1
he is no laptop manager and he calls it as he sees it			0
there has been talk in some quarters that if he does n’t finish in the top four he will lose his job			2
spurs might expect a top - four finish but they do n’t have a divine right to be there — they ’ve done it only twice in 24 years			1
people will say his words will damage the dressing room , but there ’s no better way for the players to prove themselves than in the @entity96 on sunday			2
fuming : @entity59 pulled no punches after @entity53 were thrashed by @entity98 @entity99 @entity100 had a great game for @entity102 and continues to build on his impressive reputation			1
and when you look at some of @entity53 ’s defending , you wonder why they let him go			1
if @entity53 are in the market for a defender , @entity100 is exactly the kind of person they would be going for			1
@entity98 re-signed @entity111 after all , and stranger things have happened			0
case for the defence : @entity100 has had a better season than many of his former @entity53 team - mates not bad , @entity118 , but not as good as gazza ! it ’s been a good weekend for goal celebrations			1
@entity122 headbutted a corner flag and i loved @entity125 ’s on saturday night			1
it was cheeky and a great way to respond to @entity129 ’s comments about his age — even @entity129 was laughing			2
@entity98 pensioner : @entity125 celebrates his goal against @entity53 on saturday some people have said it was the best ever , but if @entity125 gets a 9.9 from the judges , then @entity138 and the dentist ’s chair gets a perfect 10			1
before that game against @entity140 he told us that he would go for it if he scored			0
we did n’t believe him but then he scored that incredible goal and he set off			0
we all thought , ‘ where ’s he going ? ’ then he just sprawled out on the floor and we all joined in			0
it was a genius goal and a genius celebration			0
no contest : @entity138 celebrates with ( left to right ) @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity0 @entity151 what a result for @entity153			0
i knew they would give @entity156 a tough game but i did not expect that			0
they play good football , just as they did under @entity163 , and @entity164 uses a system that works			0
@entity166 will feel like he ’s won the pools			0
@entity168 could finally end the years without a trophy , but before they get too excited they should remember losing to @entity170 in the @entity171 final four years ago			1
you ca n’t underestimate @entity153 , who join only @entity174 , @entity98 and @entity175 in winning at the @entity176 this season			2
@entity179 boss @entity178 enjoyed a great result against @entity181 — one of his old clubs — and will face yet another in @entity185			0
@entity186 has done wonders at the @entity188 , taking them from 21st to 11th and winning nine on the spin			0
@entity190 will soon have them back where they belong			0
pointing the way : ex-city striker @entity164 produced another upset for @entity153 butt of the joke : @entity179 midfielder @entity122 shows his sense of humour after scoring on sunday that way to @entity201 : @entity186 has guided @entity202 @entity185 to the semi-final @entity204 need a miracle @entity204 has always been a club that prides itself on stability , but they have caught the @entity40 madness bug			0
to go through three managers in three months beggars belief , because there is no magic wand			0
they have fewer points at this stage than all three relegated sides had last season			0
it ’s an awfully long way back from here			0
in need a miracle : @entity204 manager @entity221 watched his side lose again @entity224 memo we had a reminder on saturday of the quality of some of @entity224 ’s fringe players with good performances from @entity231 and @entity232			1
@entity233 ’s @entity231 has had a good season and though @entity232 was on the losing side against @entity168 , his run to set up @entity238 ’s goal was sensational			1
he is one of the few @entity224 central midfielders who can run with the ball at pace down the middle			2
both would be unlucky to be left in the departure lounge rather than boarding the plane to @entity246			0
knocking on the door : @entity238 's @entity232 ( left ) and @entity233 's @entity231 ( right )			1

@entity5 was @entity6 ’s main man last season but has been overtaken by *£* *300,000* - a - week @entity33
i would n’t be surprised if @entity6 decide @entity5 can go in the summer
@entity59 's honesty is refreshing - @entity53 will be *revved* up for @entity168
spurs should try to re-sign @entity102 and @entity224 defender @entity100
@entity125 's celebration was *brilliant* but nothing on @entity259 's at @entity260
@entity231 and @entity232 did their @entity224 chances no harm
