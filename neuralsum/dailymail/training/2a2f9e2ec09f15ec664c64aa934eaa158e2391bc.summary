the weather forecast for this saturday evening in @entity1 is muggy and that is a warning to @entity4 on two counts			2
this is not the moment for doing anything daft			0
nor can he afford to be waylaid			0
as @entity11 sets out upon the road to redemption there is no scope for another mishap			0
certainly not one as calamitous as his starching by @entity18			0
@entity4 ( left ) takes on @entity19 ( right ) for the @entity21 middleweight title on saturday the pair will fight at @entity23 as @entity4 looks to win the belt and become @entity26 world title challenger reassuringly , he knows it			1
in the early part of the build up for this @entity21 super-middleweight title challenge to @entity32 holder @entity19 , @entity4 talked - whimsically and almost certainly in vain - about a third tilt at world champion @entity18 despite two stoppages at the hands of the @entity36			1
he also expanded on his writing of a sit - com and introduced the first recruits to his secondary boxing business as a now - licensed manager			0
but now he sounds fully focussed on what should be a routine job at hand , assuming there really are no distractions			0
@entity4 says ‘ i ’m back on track to win a world title and i ’m aware i ca n’t afford another mistake			1
’ @entity4 ( left ) weighed in at 11st 13lb 6oz with @entity19 ( right ) topping the scales at a heavier 11st 13lbs 8oz @entity4 knows he must beat @entity19 in order to save his career at the highest level and box for a world title if any additional incentive were needed for him to rebound from that brutal knock - out inflicted by @entity18 in the @entity59 just across the way from the @entity23 in which he fights @entity19 , it comes with the @entity26 ’s confirmation that the winner of this one will become the mandatory challenger for that organisation ’s version of the world title			1
and @entity4 came in just under the 12st super-middleweight limit at 11st 13lb 6oz with @entity19 weighing slightly more at 11st 13lbs 8oz			1
@entity4 proved adept at manipulating the alpha - belt boxing bodies when cornering @entity18 into two compulsory @entity70 belt defences in succession			2
@entity4 ( left ) takes is hit cleanly by @entity18 ( right ) in their rematch at @entity1 in may , his second straight loss @entity4 makes his return to the ring on saturday night at @entity1 as he looks to overcome @entity19 now he has done it again with the @entity26 , much to the annoyance of their new champion @entity79 who complains that he is not worthy of the honour			1
to which @entity4 says : ‘ whether he likes it or not - and he sounds scared of me - that ’s the way it is and once i ’ve beaten @entity19 i ’m coming for him			2
’ as a lateral thinker and a young multi-tasker , @entity4 is one of the more interesting personalities of the prize - ring			0
but come this @entity91 there is nothing complicated about what must be done to reactivate his career			0
simply , he has to apply his superior ring - craft to a crushing of the fanciful world title aspirations of a moderate opponent			2
the @entity101 has much to contemplate as he looks to rebuild his boxing reputation on a return to the ring @entity26 world champion @entity79 ( right ) lands a punch on @entity106 during their fight last month @entity4 v @entity19 is live on @entity110 hd this saturday night from 8pm .			1

@entity4 takes on @entity19 at @entity1 on saturday
@entity4 is challenging @entity19 for @entity21 super-middleweight title
@entity101 says he is ' back on track to win a world title ' with this bout
but he says he ' ca *n't* afford another mistake ' after two losses to @entity18
@entity4 weight in a 11st 13lb 6oz , @entity19 meanwhile was 11st 13lbs 8oz
compulsory shot at @entity26 champion @entity79 not far off for @entity4
