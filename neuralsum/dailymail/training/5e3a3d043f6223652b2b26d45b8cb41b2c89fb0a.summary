struggling restaurant chain @entity0 is going back to its roots with a new menu that ’s set to feature more dishes featuring lobster			1
a revamped menu announced on monday removes several poorly received non-seafood dishes including @entity7 and a @entity8			1
these non-seafood dishes had been added by the chain 's previous owner , @entity12 , in the vain hope of attracting people who do n't like seafood as sales declined			1
‘ at the end of the day , we believe that seafood is really why people come to @entity0 , ’ said @entity29 , @entity0 's president			2
@entity0 says the menu will be easier to navigate and features more photos of the food			0
four of the five new dishes include lobster , and it 's increasing the amount of shrimp in the popular @entity41 platter by 50 percent			0
the price of the dish , which also includes lobster and crab , will go up by a dollar to $ 26.99			0
the reversal comes after @entity0 was sold off to investment firm @entity48 by @entity12 during the summer			2
the struggling restaurant chain is going back to its roots with a new menu that ’s set to feature 10 percent more seafood @entity12 , which is based in @entity54 , @entity55 , and owns @entity56 , had failed to turn around the chain 's declining sales and blamed a variety of factors such as the growing availability of shrimp at other restaurants and price - sensitive customers			1
for its last fiscal year , @entity12 had said @entity0 's sales declined 6 percent at established locations , following a 2.2 percent decline the previous year			1
@entity0 , which is still operating out of @entity12 's offices until it moves into its new home , will no longer have to disclose its sales figures because it is privately held			2
whether its new menu will win back customers remains to be seen , with people increasingly heading to chains like @entity77 where they feel they can get high - quality food without paying as much			0
off the menu : dishes removed from the latest @entity0 menu include the poorly received @entity7 , right , and the @entity8 , left other changes had already been in the works			1
ceo @entity84 , who is back at @entity0 after serving as its president from 2004 to 2011 , has said steep discounting like ‘ 30 shrimp for $ 11.99 ’ was a mistake			0
the chain this summer also started changing the way it plates its dishes , with fish piled over rice instead of having foods spread out on a dish			0
@entity0 says that presentation is more visually appealing , while also helping retain the food 's heat .			0

out go dishes including @entity7 and a @entity8 and in comes 10 percent more seafood
