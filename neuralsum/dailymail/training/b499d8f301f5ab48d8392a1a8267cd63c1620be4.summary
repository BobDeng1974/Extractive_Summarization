by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:15 est , 7 february 2014 women have been trying to figure out what men want for decades , devouring dating tomes such as men are from @entity9 women are from @entity10 in the hope they might bring them closer to the answer			1
today , new research promises to offer an insight into the mysterious workings of a man 's heart			1
a study of 2,000 men has revealed that the ' perfect girlfriend ' is 5ft 5in tall , drinks white wine , has no tattoos and supports @entity26			1
when it comes to appearance men want their girlfriend to resemble @entity31 the survey by dating app company @entity33 also found that men go for a woman with an @entity38 accent and who drive a @entity40			1
and it 's bad news for single vegetarians , with the majority of men agreeing that they like a girl who enjoys meat and loves a roast dinner			1
ladies can breath a small sigh of relief when it comes to weight though , with men 's expectations not being too unrealistic , preferring a woman who weighs a healthy 9st 2lbs , and has a bra size of @entity58			2
single men also had an opinion as to what their dates should be watching , possibly to avoid any scraps over the remote control ? their first choice was @entity66 , followed by @entity67 , friends and then @entity69			0
guys prefer a girlfriend who lists ' @entity69 ' as one of their favourite programmes when it comes to films , @entity74 is their ideal girl 's film of choice and rock is her favourite music genre			2
they do n't want her sitting around watching too many @entity83 classics though			0
the survey revealed that they would rather date a hard - working woman , with a nurse and teacher being the top professions of choice			1
when asked what celebrity would best resemble their perfect girlfriend , @entity31 took the lead followed by @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
a spokesman for @entity33 said that the men 's choices may be slightly unrealistic and that they should keep their options open : ' it seems that @entity104 men have very specific tastes for a girl to live up to			1
' we know that everyone has a favourite hair colour and sometimes even eye colour and height , with brown hair being the colour of choice in this instance			0
' but we think that avoiding a woman because she might support an opposing football team or enjoy a different genre of films to you , might be being a bit too picky			0
' they went on to say that having too many specific ideas of the perfect partner is the reason why some men may be finding it difficult to find a partner			1
' we encourage meeting up with people you share interests with , but suggest not being too strict as you might find that you get to learn something new			0
' avoiding a woman because she might support an opposing football team or enjoy a different genre of films to you , might be being a bit too picky			0
' @entity139 , @entity33 ' dating is fun and should n't become a chore or make you feel as though you wo n't ever find " the one "			2
being more open to new things will certainly help you find that perfect girlfriend			2
' thankfully there were some things that men were happy to keep their options open about			0
their perfect partner enjoys a wide range of hobbies , including reading and travelling			2
they also want a woman with a full social life who loves to go to bars with their friends and enjoys going to concerts			0
when it comes to sex , men want their perfect girlfriend to be adventurous in the bedroom , and be happy to embark in a bit of role play as well as enjoy experimenting with different positions			2
although men want a girl who can impress them , the study revealed it is also important for their girlfriend to get on with the other most important woman in their life - their mum			1
open minded : men prefer a woman who will experiment in the bedroom despite their rather specific desires , such as preferring women to wear miniskirts or skinny jeans , three quarters of the single men said they do n't think they will meet their perfect woman and will have to compromise instead			1
and it appears that a lot of men have already learned the art of compromise with two in five men in a relationship believing that their current wife or girlfriend is n't the perfect woman for them			1
the spokesman added : ' it is very surprising that so many men who are currently in a relationship , feel as though they are n't with the right woman for them			0
' and it 's sad to see that some single men do n't believe the perfect woman exists			1
' we want to show these men that we do n't agree , there is someone out there for everyone			0
' and if they 're lucky they might even find their perfect woman in time for @entity213			0

a dating company survey has revealed what a man 's idea of a perfect girl is
*qualities* include being a *fan* of @entity26 and enjoying white wine
experts warn men need to be able compromise to find a partner
