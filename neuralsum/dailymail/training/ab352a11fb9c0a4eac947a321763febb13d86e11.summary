by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 05:49 est , 12 november 2012 under - fire mp @entity1 has defended her controversial decision to go on i 'm a celebrity ... @entity4 - claiming she will donate her mps ' salary during her time on the show to charity			1
mrs @entity1 did not mention what she intends to do with her fee from @entity13 's reality show			1
she is receiving a reported £ 40,000 fee for taking part - nearly eight times the maximum amount of money she will donate			1
with an @entity7 ' salary of £ 65,738 per year , if she lasts the full three weeks on the show , she will donate a mere £ 3,738.57 to charity			1
@entity1 looks worn out after her first appearance on i 'm a celebrity ... @entity23 yesterday - coinciding with the publication of her column revealed she will donate her mps ' salary for the time she is on the show to charity but mrs @entity1 has accounted for four weeks leave from her constituency - which would increase her donation to £ 5,056.76			1
she made the extraordinary comments before her laptop was taken away at the start of filming for the show and imposed an embargo for it to appear in her @entity37 website column after the show went live			1
the news comes after her @entity41 constituents were furious at the prospect of her abandoning her post for up to four weeks on full pay			0
the mp has drawn widespread criticism for swapping her parliamentary duties for the @entity48 reality tv jungle , and has been suspended by her party while she is away			2
despite the furore , mrs @entity1 seems to believe appearing on the show will only enhance her career as a politician			2
she says in her blog that being on the show is a ' publicity gift ' and a way of communicating with 16 million people			1
she says she ' seized ' upon the opportunity , and ' who would n't ? ' she justified her decision , arguing that ' more people watch the x- factor final than voted in the general election ' , so the realm of reality tv is ' where politicians need to be too '			2
mrs @entity1 said that while she may have to eat a kangaroo 's testicle she may also have the chance to talk about abortion time limits , or to ' big up @entity72 '			2
in her column she would donate her mp 's salary during her time on the programme to children 's charities in her constituency			1
prime minister @entity80 has backed the decision by chief whip sir @entity82 to suspend her and said mrs @entity1 had not informed him she was taking part in the @entity13 show			1
@entity86 mp @entity1 has drawn widespread criticism for swapping her parliamentary duties for the @entity48 reality tv jungle , where she is pictured on the show , right if mrs @entity1 , pictured on the show , will donate £ 5056,76 to charity accounting for four weeks away from her constituency to be in @entity48 but mrs @entity1 insisted in her column - which she submitted a week ago and was published yesterday - that she had told the @entity93 she would be away for up to a month			1
she wrote : ' do people understand why i am in a jungle , eating only three handfuls of rice a day with a few beans thrown in ? ' i think many may have guessed that i am a bit of an anti-politics politician ... i believe that we politicians need to spend less time talking to each other and more time talking to people			0
' she continued : ' an audience of 16 million people for the first and last show and 12 million per show is a very large audience			0
in the world of messaging , it 's huge			0
it would have been mad to have refused ... the majority of people do n't look to @entity118 and they do n't buy newspapers , as the distribution figures show us			0
@entity1 says she ' seized ' upon the opportunity to take part on the show			1
here she talks politics with @entity126 ' they do however surf the net , watch popular tv and engage with reality shows			0
if that is where sixteen million people are , it 's where politicians need to be too			0
' she added : ' mps are not popular and so i do n't expect to be in the jungle for very long but i hope i can do something to make some people think again			0
that some of us politicians come from very normal backgrounds and went into politics for reasons of deep belief and principle			0
' and in a typically acerbic parting shot she said : ' whilst the half term recess is under way , i will be working with rats and snakes in a jungle			0
it 's not really very different from @entity118 after all			0
' the politician was accused of snubbing a @entity161 service yesterday in her constituency by taking part in the show			2
the @entity165 in her constituency told @entity13 it received a letter from the mp in the @entity168 , saying she would be ' out of the country ' and could not attend .			0

@entity172 defence of her decision was written for her @entity37 column under embargo to appear after reality show went live yesterday
she wrote the comments before her laptop was taken away from her
@entity1 will donate a maximum of £ 5,056.76 - four weeks salary - to charity , *compared* to the fee of up to £ 40,000 that she will earn for appearance
