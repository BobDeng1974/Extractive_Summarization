dispute : the row centred on garlic from @entity3 @entity4 has been forced to hand over £ 15 million to the @entity5 to settle a bizarre dispute over garlic			1
@entity8 demanded the sum because it ruled that the @entity4 did not charge enough duty on shipments of garlic from @entity3			1
judges at @entity15 ’s top court said the @entity4 taxman should have classed the imported garlic as fresh rather than frozen , and so charged a higher tariff			1
last night critics mockingly dubbed the charge a @entity21 , because of garlic ’s fabled anti-vampire powers , and said the case illustrated the power of @entity5 institutions and the way they increasingly get the better of @entity4			1
just last week , @entity28 revealed that the @entity29 is taking the government to court to make it easier for migrants to get benefits by scrapping restrictions on who can claim child benefit and tax credits			2
judges at the @entity41 court have also overruled @entity4 ’s objections to a cap on bankers ’ bonuses , in what is seen as a damaging blow to the @entity48			2
@entity50 sir @entity49 , a leading @entity51 mp who chairs the @entity52 , said last night : ‘ this £ 15 million is a lot of money by any standards , but what i call the @entity21 is just yet another example of what is now becoming an endemic problem			0
‘ we are increasingly losing cases in the court – it ’s a natural consequence us our being boxed into a @entity52 legal framework that is not dependent on policy			0
i think this case is petty but it also highlights what we are up against			0
’ he believes @entity68 needs to pass a new law that would enable ministers to bypass the demands of the @entity52 court as well as human rights legislation			0
the garlic case took almost a decade to be resolved			0
it began when the @entity76 inspected ‘ imports of fresh garlic originating in @entity3 ’ and concluded that the authorities in @entity4 had made ‘ obvious administrative errors ’			1
investigators claimed @entity83 ( @entity83 ) staff had not been checking whether the garlic coming into @entity4 was fresh or frozen , and simply charged the lower rate of duty applied to frozen vegetables when the cargo was fresh			1
eventually the @entity29 told the @entity4 to pay it just over £ 20 million for underpayment of duty on imports of garlic between january 2005 and december 2006			1
@entity4 refused to pay up , claiming there was nothing owed , and was taken to court			2
the dispute came after @entity4 did not know whether it was paying for frozen or fresh imported garlic @entity83 said it originally believed the garlic , which was stored at @entity98 , counted as completely frozen but later scientific evidence suggested otherwise			1
the agreements with the @entity3 food companies concerned could not be changed retrospectively , so the extra duty could not be collected later			2
@entity83 has now paid £ 15 million as it was allowed to keep a quarter of the bill to cover the costs of collection			0
a spokesman for @entity83 said last night : ‘ we were naturally disappointed with the judgment			0
‘ the @entity29 ’s case relied heavily on facts regarding the freezing point of garlic which came to light subsequently and which we did not know at the time the classification rulings were issued			0

@entity8 demanded @entity4 pay the sum for garlic shipped from @entity3
judges said taxman should have been classed as fresh rather than frozen
the difference means @entity4 has been underpaying tax for the *product*
