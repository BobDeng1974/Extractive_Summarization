a long - awaited rescue of passengers on board a research ship trapped in @entity5 ice for more than a week was today successfully completed			2
a helicopter airlifted passengers to a nearby vessel after landing on a makeshift helipad next to the stranded ship			1
the helicopter was originally going to fly the passengers to a @entity14 icebreaker , the @entity15 , with a barge then ferrying them to a nearby @entity18 vessel			1
but sea ice was preventing the barge from reaching the @entity15 , and the @entity21 's @entity20 , which is overseeing the rescue , said the operation would consequently be delayed			2
the 52 scientists and tourists on board were instead flown to an ice floe next to the @entity18 icebreaker the @entity51 , and then taken by a small boat to the @entity18 ship , expedition leader @entity54 said			1

the ship is n't in danger of sinking and has weeks ' worth of supplies on board , but it can not move			0
