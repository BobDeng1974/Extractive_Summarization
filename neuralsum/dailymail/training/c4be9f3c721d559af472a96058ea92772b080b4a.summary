an amateur photographer claims is being haunted by a ghost which emits a peculiar smell of fish just before tragedy is about to strike someone she knows			1
@entity7 , 27 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , claims she has smelt the fishy odour on a number of indications before something bad has happened - such as a family friend dying or her grandmother being taken into hospital			1
but rather than fear the spectre , which has stalked her for 10 years , and its distinctive smell @entity20 has now come to accept it and takes the aroma as a clear warning to be on her guard			2
it also inspired her to become a ghost hunter and she has used her enthusiasm for photography to capture spectres on film - even photographing what she believes is the ghost of a monk in @entity9			1
' ever since i was little , i 've sensed spirits around me			0
i 'd pick up on presences in the room and the fishy smell would come as a warning			2
' the ill - scented encounters started when miss @entity7 was around nine or 10 and shortly afterwards a relative was rushed into hospital after suffering a stroke			1
she said : ' in a way , the spirits ' whiffy warning had helped prepare me			2
' it was this episode which prompted miss @entity7 to work as a ghost hunter â€“ one of the @entity59 's only female stalkers			1
' i often visited old buildings to take photos			0
miss @entity7 said she believes this picture has captured an image of a ghost of a monk in a church window ' i noticed a number of my pictures were covered in light orbs			1
' when i researched it online , i learnt that some people believe it indicates a spirit present in the picture			0
' this made me think , ' i 'm going to catch more than light orbs '			0
' so i continued scouring old buildings , snapping away			0
' in january last year miss @entity7 , who works as a machinist , was taking pictures of @entity80 and @entity81 church in @entity82 , @entity9 , when she captured a mysterious image			1
the amateur photographer took up ghost hunting after the ' smelly ghost ' seemed to be warning her miss @entity7 said she picks up presences in a room and the fishy smells then come as a warning to her since starting to hunt for ghosts @entity20 has become determined to capture more images of spectres she said : ' in one of the pictures , a ghostly figure was standing in the window of the church			1
' i glance up and the ghost had disappeared			0
' i made my way home and uploaded the pictures onto my laptop			0
' as i zoomed into the image i noticed it looked like a monk			2
' i did some research and discovered the church was founded by monks hundreds of years ago			0
in this photo , taken in 2011 , miss @entity7 said there is an image of a girl in top right corner and some orbs ' i realised it must have been haunted by them and i 'd caught one on camera			1
' i could n't believe i 'd managed it			0
' but i know it 's a real ghost			0
' and it 's just made me even more determined to catch spirits on camera			0
' i suppose you could call me a real - life ghost hunter			2
' and in 2011 miss @entity7 claims she took a photo at @entity129 which captured an image of a girl , with orbs in the top right hand corner .			1
