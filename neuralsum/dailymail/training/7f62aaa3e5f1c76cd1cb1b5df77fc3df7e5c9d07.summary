@entity137 , a @entity3 immigration lawyer based in @entity138 , @entity139 , said her celebrity status as the ‘ @entity0 ’ may have counted against her			1
‘ i strongly doubt that if someone who was not particularly notable made an admission in court proceedings about past drug use , it would come up , ’ he said			0

the typical wait time is about 20 to 25 weeks but you can get it done in a matter of days			0
you need to demonstrate a need for it to be handled quickly , ’ he said			0
being blocked from @entity3 caps a torrid 12 months for @entity161 , who has endured a very public divorce from her former husband @entity108			0
the marriage broke down irrevocably after mr @entity108 , 70 , a wealthy art collector , accepted a caution for assault when newspapers printed pictures of him with his hand around his wife ’s throat outside @entity173 ’s restaurant in @entity174 in june			0

she said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband , @entity186 , and the ‘ intimate terrorism ’ of her second , mr @entity108			0
the tv cook also described how she ‘ smoked the odd joint ’ of cannabis in the last year of her marriage to mr @entity108 to make ‘ an intolerable situation tolerable ’			0
but she maintained that she was now drug - free , telling the jury : ‘ i did not and do not have a drug problem , i had a life problem			0
