by @entity0 @entity1 must be the only man on the planet who did n’t know @entity3 had won the @entity4 until this morning			1
the chartered surveyor has spent the past 43 days on the most remote outpost in the @entity7 – @entity8 – beating the previous record set by a solo man by three days			1
just 20 metres high and the size of two tennis courts , the tiny granite chunk 286 miles off @entity15 ’s west coast is almost uninhabitable			1
but the 39 - year - old was n’t too bothered about being left out of the football mania that ’s gripped the world over these past few months			2
mr @entity1 , who is married to @entity24 with whom he has a two - year - old son called @entity26 , said : ‘ i ’m not a football fan so i feel quite fortunate that i missed out on the television being dominated by the @entity4			1
‘ my wife , on the other hand , is a fan and joked that she was glad i was away so she could watch all the games without me complaining			2
’ but rather than fleeing civilization in a bid to avoid the @entity4 , mr @entity1 spent 43 lonely days on the island to raise £ 10,000 for @entity35			1
speaking about his achievement , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i reminded myself this morning as soon as i woke up , that today was a new record			1
’ lonely : mr @entity1 celebrates by himself after beating the world record for the longest solo stay on the remote island @entity8			1
there are no inhabitants on the island apart from a few birds			2
he spent 43 days living inside the ' house pod ' pictured but mr @entity1 has had to postpone the celebrations until he gets home to @entity48 , near @entity49 , because he has no - one to toast with on the remote island			1
the only other inhabitants include a few birds that he befriended earlier in his stay			0
he said : ‘ it ’s strange really , as it ’s just another day on the rock			0
‘ i had a little smile to myself , but there ’s been no euphoria as such			0
‘ i had no one to celebrate with			0
’ mr @entity1 told how he began talking to some homing pigeons and guillemot birds to alleviate his boredom , but the wildlife had all since disappeared by the time he broke the world record			1
he said : ‘ it ’s been relatively quiet on the wildlife front since there was a storm			0
‘ there ’ve been no new oddities like the racing pigeons , and i have n’t seen much of the minke whales			0
’ mr @entity1 landed on the rock on june 5 , a week before the first @entity4 match kicked off , and set up his tiny yellow ‘ house pod ’			1
he had originally planned to stay for 60 days but was forced to curtail his quest after losing four barrels of supplies in a storm at the beginning of the month			0
the pod , which was secured to the rock with bolts , was just 15 metres above the lapping waves			0
mr @entity1 had thought the pod was watertight but it sprung a leak in the hinge of the top hatch during the storm			2
to stop more water from coming in , mr @entity1 had to close his ventilation hatches causing the temperature in the pod to soar			2
after enduring the elements for more than a month , mr @entity1 is glad to be coming home			1
and having eaten nothing but army ration packs , he has a few food items in mind for his arrival home			0
he said : ‘ i ’m looking forward to a glass of wine and a pint of good ale when i get back			0
i think a pizza is in order too			2
’ mr @entity1 will no doubt be looking forward to the prospect of walking to his local @entity108 when he gets home , as @entity8 offers little opportunity for exploring			1
much of the land is too steep and rocky to be accessible			0
when mr @entity1 did stray from his pod , he wore a harness attached to the rock with a strong lifeline so he would n’t be blown into the sea			2
the little area that his pod rests on is just 3.3 x 1.2 m ( 11 x 4 ft )			0
there are no bushes or trees — just seaweed , algae and a single black lichen			0
occupation : in 1997 , three @entity126 members set the group record of 42 days			0
in 1985 the former @entity129 soldier @entity128 set the 40 - day solo occupancy record , which mr @entity1 has just beaten back to civilisation : @entity128 , who set the original 40 - day solo record in 1985 for time spent on the island , does a hand stand when he gets back to the mainland			1
mr @entity1 plans to order a pint and a pizza twenty species of bird and six species of animal have been recorded on or near the island , but human beings have never been in abundance			1
the first recorded landing was in 1811 by a @entity148 officer called @entity149 , who gave the name @entity151 to the flat area where @entity1 has anchored his pod			2
in 1955 , @entity8 was claimed by a group of @entity155 who hoisted the @entity157 there — worried that foreign forces might invade the island and use it as observation post			1
then the @entity162 of @entity163 was passed by @entity164 , formally declaring it to be part of @entity167 , even though the nearest permanently inhabited settlement is 228 miles away on @entity169 in the @entity170			0
over the years , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 ( on behalf of the @entity174 ) have each lodged competing claims			0
in 1974 the @entity148 landed again , then in 1985 the former @entity129 soldier @entity128 set the 40 - day solo occupancy record , living in a wooden shelter			1
in 1997 , three @entity126 members set the group record of 42 days .			0

@entity1 has been living on @entity8 - the most remote outpost in the @entity7
he has beaten the 40 - day record to raise £ 10,000 for help the heroes
the tiny granite island is completely cut off from civilisation
as a result he did **n't** learn the *results* of the @entity4 until this morning
the chartered surveyor is returning home to his wife and son today
after surviving on rations he ca **n't** wait to order a pint and a pizza
