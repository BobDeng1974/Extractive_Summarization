by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 11:54 est , 9 october 2012 it may only be october , but we can think of one very good reason to get hold of your 2013 calender right now			0
actually , we can think of 11 very good reasons			0
@entity9 firemen have peeled off their suspenders , slipped out of their t - shirts and stripped down to their flame - retardant trousers to be photographed for a steamy topless calendar , through which they hope to raise money for a motor neurone disease charity			1
scorching : the eleven brave firemen from the @entity18 strip off in front of their truck for the charity 2013 calendar , to raise money for @entity23 @entity25 's lift : the burly men are never more at home than when they are lifting someone to safety , even if that someone is a fellow topless colleague firefighter @entity31 , 36 , of @entity32 , said : ' we originally did a photograph as a bit of a laugh for watch manager @entity38 's wife , but it turned out to be really fun			1
the shoot itself was great fun and everyone had a really good time , it was very relaxed as you can tell from the pictures			1
' @entity47 , chair of the @entity23 's @entity50 and @entity51 branch , had the idea of producing the calendar			1
ms @entity47 , whose mother has the disease , said : ' the idea was well - received , and with willing participants we have been able to put together a fantastic calendar			2
' we have had some great support from companies that have sponsored the calendar to help with production costs			2
considering that no - one has any experience in front of the camera the firefighters look really relaxed , and they were all thrilled with the finished photos			0
' @entity71 in @entity50 - which gives the @entity73 branch and their patients a huge amount of care and support - will also receive 25 per cent of profits from sales of the Â£ 8 calendar			2
@entity81 , @entity82 , said : ' our staff were happy to volunteer and assist one of our colleagues with such a worthy cause that can make such a difference to those individuals and families affected by such a debilitating disease , and we wish @entity47 and the charity well in the sale of the calendar			2
' @entity95 trouser competition : one of the firemen , left , gets a hosing down , while @entity97 is the poster - boy for the month of january , right motor neurone disease is a progressive disease that attacks the motor neurones , or nerves , in the brain and spinal cord			0
this means messages gradually stop reaching muscles , which leads to weakness and wasting			0
it can affect how you walk , talk , eat , drink and breathe , and although there is currently no cure , symptoms can be managed to help you achieve the best possible quality of life			0
the calendar is being sold in @entity9 and @entity117 , and on @entity118			0
to obtain a copy , email @entity47 at @entity121 for more information about @entity73 , visit the @entity23 website			1
taking it in his stride : the @entity9 lads all seem to be have enjoyed themselves rather a lot during the charity photo shoot boys and their toys : one bare - chested fireman ensures safety comes first by wearing his helmet while playing with power tools charity effort : proceeds from sales of the calendar will go towards the @entity23 .			1
