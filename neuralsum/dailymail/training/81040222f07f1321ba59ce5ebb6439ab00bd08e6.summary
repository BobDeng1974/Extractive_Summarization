by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 25 december 2012 abandoned dogs that were facing death because they bark too loudly have been saved after hundreds of people stepped in to help			1
twin sisters @entity5 and @entity7 , who run @entity8 , feared they would have to make the heartbreaking decision to destroy the animals after one noise complaint was made by a neighbour			1
the 70 - year - old sisters were issued with a council noise abatement order , which meant they must find homes for the 17 dogs or erect a £ 2,000 soundproof fence that they could not afford			1
if that failed the dogs would have to be put down			0
overwhelmed : @entity5 , left , said she and twin sister @entity7 , right , have been moved by the response life line : the twins are hoping they can now build a soundproof fence with the pledged money but after people heard their plight , the twins have been swamped with pledges of money to save the dogs from death row			1
a law firm has even offered to provide a free legal service if the sisters , who have cared for abandoned animals since 1948 , decided to fight the council order			2
mrs @entity40 said the response has been ' overwhelming '			0
the sanctuary , in @entity43 , @entity44 , costs £ 3,000 a week to run and , although they receive donations , the sisters and their husbands prop it up with their own cash			0
they feared they may have to close it after the council issued the order			0
but now mrs @entity40 thinks they will have enough money to build the fence			2
she said : ' the the phone has n't stopped ringing since 6.30 each morning			0
' we just can not believe the support we have received from all over the country and even abroad			0
' all these dogs were abandoned , their owners did n't want them or could n't care for them but this shows people really care because at the moment there are so many animals being abandoned			1
death row : the 17 abandoned dogs have been saved and will now be able to stay at the sanctuary care : the twins have been looking after abandoned animals since 1948 ' we are so grateful to everyone who has offered their support			1
you do n't realise how nice a lot of people are			0
' we think we will get enough to buy the fence , because quite a lot of people have pledged to send us money			2
' the animal sanctuary is also home to 10 cows , 10 ponies , seven pigs , five sheep , five llamas and three goats			0
the sisters began caring for animals when they were just six when their family saved a young pony called @entity97 because a neighbour was sending her to be slaughtered .			1

the animals faced death after a neighbour complained about their noise
*santuary* owners @entity5 and @entity7 say they are ' overwhelmed '
a soundproof fence can now be built at @entity8
