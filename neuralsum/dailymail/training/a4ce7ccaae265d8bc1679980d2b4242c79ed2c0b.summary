by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 19:03 est , 25 september 2012 call for investigation : @entity2 said it was ' highly unusual ' for a senior official to be involved in the detail of an industrial deal a leading @entity7 yesterday heaped pressure on cabinet secretary sir @entity9 over his role in the controversial @entity12 merger of defence giant @entity13			1
@entity2 said the @entity14 – which is probing the proposed link up between @entity13 and civil aviation firm @entity16 – should question @entity18 ’s top mandarin , saying it was ‘ highly unusual ’ for such a senior official to be involved in the detail of an industrial deal			1
sir @entity9 ’s role has raised eyebrows since he worked for four years at @entity24 , the investment bank advising @entity13 on the £ 28billion merger with the @entity28 - @entity27 firm			1
the @entity29 revealed earlier this week that he has held four private meetings with @entity13 over the last 15 months , plus two with @entity24 and another with @entity16 – which will control 60 per cent of the new firm			1
mr @entity2 said it ‘ would be a good idea ’ for sir @entity9 to give evidence to the select committee			1
he added : ‘ i do think it ’s highly unusual for someone as senior as the cabinet secretary to be involved in a deal like this			1
‘ you can imagine senior staff in the @entity42 and the @entity43 taking an interest but quite why the cabinet secretary is involved , i ’m not at all sure			2
it ’s not something that ’s within his purview			0
‘ i ’m sure he ’s been utterly proper and obeyed all the rules but the worry is that the judge of whether a civil servant has behaved appropriately is the cabinet secretary himself			0
it would have made more sense if he had delegated to other officials			0
’ mps on the @entity14 say they are seeking to call senior officials from @entity60 and the @entity43 to give evidence about the deal			2
collaboration : @entity13 , which may be merged with aviation firm @entity16 , helped to build the @entity64 sources close to sir @entity9 said he would be prepared to appear before the committee but said the onus would be on the mps to submit a formal invitation			1
yesterday deputy prime minister @entity70 backed the deal , saying it would further the cause of @entity12 defence integration			0
his intervention is also controversial since it pre-empts a decision by business secretary @entity77 about whether to refer the merger to the @entity79			0
and his call for @entity12 defence cooperation will be a red rag to many @entity83 , who fear the deal will see @entity18 ’s biggest defence firm fall partly under the control of the @entity28 and @entity27 governments , which own shares in @entity16			1
' backing the bid ' : prime minister @entity90 in an interview with @entity92 , mr @entity70 said : ‘ the two companies are making a case , a strong case , in favour of this merger			2
‘ i personally have always been in favour , over time , of greater consolidation in the @entity12 defence industry			0
’ mr @entity70 ’s words will fuel concerns among @entity7 @entity68 that the government has pre-judged the affair			2
senior officials have already revealed that @entity90 is backing the bid as long as he receives reassurances that it will not damage relations with the @entity110 , who are concerned military secrets will be compromised			0
and mr @entity77 made clear he had no objection in principle when he told a @entity116 fringe meeting on monday he did n’t ‘ worry about foreign ownership ’ of @entity18 companies – although he refused to comment on the specifics of the deal			2
former shadow home secretary mr @entity2 said : ‘ they should n’t be briefing anything until the bid has been through the proper process			1
this calls for cool , measured judgment first and activity later , not the other way around			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s very hard to see the @entity28 allowing their primary defence company to fall into foreign ownership			0
‘ this is very old - fashioned industrial politics , the idea that you bring big companies together to make even bigger companies			0
it has been a proven fallacy since the days of @entity140			0
' a spokesman for the cabinet secretary insisted it was ‘ standard practice ’ for him to show an interest in a deal involving a major government contractor like @entity13			1
he added : ‘ he is not the lead official on this , his role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement and coordination across departments			2

mr @entity2 said it is ' highly unusual ' for such a senior official to be involved in the detail of an industrial deal
