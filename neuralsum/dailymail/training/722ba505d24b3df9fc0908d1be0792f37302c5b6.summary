by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 13:39 est , 2 january 2014 a son who mistakenly spent 21 years visiting a cemetery where he thought his father 's ashes were scattered has discovered they were actually kept in a disused storage room			1
@entity8 , 63 , left instructions for the ashes of his father , @entity11 , to be scattered over a memorial rose garden when he died in 1992 aged 74			1
he and his family , who did not wish to see the scattering as it would have been too upsetting , had no reason to believe that their wishes had not carried out			0
lost : @entity8 and his wife @entity20 , pictured outside the crematorium with his the @entity23 's ashes but this year mr @entity8 found out that an administrative error meant that the ashes had never been put there - and that they had spent more than two years in storage			1
however , in a happy twist , the discovery means that the ashes of the late mr @entity8 can be reunited with those of his wife			1
while he was alive he had said he wanted his remains to be scattered at a picturesque location in @entity35 , @entity36			0
mr @entity8 had worked in the area all his life at a factory which made heavy machinery			2
in the @entity41 mr @entity8 , who had a reserved occupation , helped produce supplies to fight the @entity44			2
he had two children with his wife @entity46			0
the two assumed they would be able to arrange for their ashes to be scattered in the same place , but the family were outraged to discover it would not be possible as there was no definitive record of what happened to mr @entity8 's remains			1
new rules brought in at the crematorium means that ashes can only be scattered on the rose garden if those of a relative were already there			1
mr @entity8 , a painter and decorator with three children of his own , said : ' when my mother passed away , we were told that her ashes could be scattered over the @entity69 at @entity35 only if the remains of a relative of hers had been put there , too			1
' we told them that her husband ’s ashes had been scattered there , but then we received a letter from @entity80 telling us that they have no record of my father ’s ashes being scattered there as we instructed			0
' we ’ve been going to the crematorium for years , because that ’s where we told them to scatter my father ’s ashes			0
that ’s what he wanted			0
separated : @entity95 , right and @entity96 , left , had planned to have their ashes scattered over the same memorial rose garden ' at the time , my sister and i did not want to be present - i regret that now			1
' the strong family had struggled for months to find out what had happened to the lost ashes and , after months of chasing , it was today revealed that they had been left in a disused storage room decades earlier			1
the funeral took place so long ago , according to directors @entity113 , that there were no proper procedures for storing unclaimed ashes , which led to them being misplaced			1
after the family got in touch asking after them , the staff searched the new storage facility but did not find anything			2
however , a renewed search over @entity125 uncovered an unmarked box in the storage room			1
it contained an urn of ashes , which the company has now confirmed they are the lost remains			2
today mr @entity8 said it was a ' pleasant shock ' to have the remains returned , but that he went through ' months of hell ' not knowing where they were			1
he said : ' it ’s great that they ’re found , but we ’ve been through months of absolute hell			2
we can hopefully go up and scatter them all together			0
' there should have been an instruction to scatter the ashes			0
somehow the arrangements did n’t go to the crematorium ... i suppose we ’ll never know for sure			0
' i feel a bit bitter now because of how they treated us - i feel completely let down			0
they did n’t do their job properly 20 years ago			0
somebody made a big mistake			0
' it ’s a pleasant shock to find that they were found , but we ’ve gone through months of banging our heads against the wall			2
this has come completely out of the blue			0
' i ’m going to see him tomorrow to arrange both sets of ashes to be scattered			0
' @entity113 said they recognised the ' distress ' caused by the mix - up , but were pleased they could find what had happened to the remains			2
a statement from the company said : ' an unmarked box has now been discovered in a closed - off secure area which is seldom accessed by the current team and was therefore not searched previously			1
' within the box , we discovered a set of cremated remains which we have now been able to identify as belonging to the @entity8 family			1
' we are really pleased that we are now able to return the missing cremated remains to mr @entity8 , as we recognise the distress that this must have caused him and his family during this period of uncertainty			1
' according to the company , problems with unclaimed ashes are becoming more common in the funeral industry			0
in 2012 the director of @entity190 in @entity191 but out a last - ditch appeal in the hope that relatives would claim some of the 150 sets of remains he had been left with .			0

@entity8 , 63 , asked for remains to be put over a memorial rose garden
but he recently found out that this had never happened
the family were left not knowing what had become of the remains for months
there were plans for his mother 's remains to be put in the same place
today the funeral directors shocking revealed they had found the ashes
they were in a disused storage room and had been left in an unmarked box
now the remains of @entity8 and *mrs* @entity96 can be laid to rest together
