we 've all been there			0
the ball takes a bobble when you 're six yards out , and you fire it high over the bar			0
you swing too early and the sweet strike you 've pictured in your head is but a distant memory			0
fortunately , it happens to professional footballers too ... even the very best			0
step forward @entity12 , @entity13 and - twice - @entity14			1
@entity15 counts down the top 10 @entity17 misses of 2014 ... 10 ) @entity19 - @entity18 ' high , wide and not very handsome , ' as the commentator described it			1
admittedly , this is n't your typical miss from close range			1
attempting to whip a free - kick in from the left wing , @entity19 ' cross ends up in @entity29 of the @entity18 crowd			1
as he steps up to the ball , his left foot lifts up the turf and the final ball looks more like a rugby conversion than a football free - kick			1
a chunk of turf is ripped out by @entity19 ' remarkable free - kick for @entity18 , which balloons over the bar 9 ) @entity12 - @entity41 partly a terrible miss , partly a cracking save			1
as if facing @entity17 champions @entity44 was n't hard enough , @entity12 will be kicking himself that he did n't make the most of this gilt - edged opportunity			1
dead centre , in the 16 - yard - box , the ball fell to the @entity50 striker , who chested the ball down ready to fire it home			2
unfortunately for him - and his team , who went on to lose 4 - 0 - the ball had little power , and @entity58 was able to poke it away from danger			2
@entity12 of @entity41 ( centre ) has the whole goal to aim for but finds the foot of @entity58 8 ) @entity13 - @entity13 - @entity64 ' @entity13 ' as he has been affectionately named , has scored 66 goals in 112 appearances for @entity64			1
38 in 69 for the @entity67 , too			0
but when the ball fell to the 31 - year - old in the centre of the goal , he was simply not able to stick it in the back of the net			2
proof , it seems , that it happens to the best of us			0
thankfully for @entity13 , @entity64 went on to beat @entity79 2 - 0			2
@entity13 ( third left ) has a simple finish into the bottom corner but puts the ball wide of the mark @entity13 has been nicknamed ' @entity13 ' due to his impressive scoring record , but he missed this chance 7 ) @entity88 - @entity87 @entity87 's stalwart @entity89 had a moment to forget at @entity91 this year			1
his team lost 2 - 0 , so it 's firmly a case of what might have been had he headed home from close range			1
somehow , he gets it all wrong and heads the ball directly into the ground , before it bounces up over the bar			0
an empty goal , and what should have been an easy finish ... @entity87 's @entity88 should have cushioned his header into the net , but he puts it high and wide 6 ) @entity110 - @entity109 from a contender for goal of the season , to a contender for miss of the season in a split - second			1
what starts as a wonderful team move finishes with a disappointing miss. to be fair to @entity110 , there 's a brilliant piece of defending on the line to save a certain goal			2
but it 's a strike that would have been his side win , with the scores at 1 - 1 with less than two minutes remaining			1
@entity110 did n't show the touch of a @entity129 when he shot at the defender on the line 5 ) @entity133 - @entity132 it 's a striker 's dream			1
right place , right time			0
a shot is spilled by the opposition goalkeeper and you 're there to mop up and collect the praise			0
but for @entity132 's @entity133 , he had a moment to forget when the ball fell to his feet in a match against @entity87 this year			2
he shot , but the ball flew high and wide of a target that was gaping in front of him			0
to rub salt in the wounds , his team went on to lose 4 - 1			2
@entity133 was gifted with a chance when the keeper spilled it , but he put the ball wide 4 ) @entity158 - @entity109 he did everything but the finish			2
@entity158 is the second @entity109 player in this countdown , after his terrible miss against @entity163			1
the corner flew in from the right , and @entity158 got lucky with a touch off the defender			0
he is left with just the keeper to beat , but puts the ball over the bar			0
@entity158 got lucky when the ball fell to him from a corner , but he puts it well over the bar 3 ) @entity14 - @entity175 @entity175 's @entity14 is in at three ... and it 's not his only appearance on this countdown			1
a fantastic ball is whipped in from the right , but the @entity181 defensive midfielder gets himself in a tangle and can not put the ball in the back of the net			0
@entity14 's first entry sees him get in a tangle while playing for @entity175 2 ) @entity14 - @entity175 the phrase , ' it was harder to miss ' has never been more true			1
@entity14 , take a bow			1
less than a yard out , his initial shot lands at his feet for him to poke home			0
but alas , he somehow - inexplicably - puts the ball wide			2
in a quite remarkable miss , @entity14 puts the ball wide from very , very close range 1 ) @entity200 - @entity199 there are n't sufficient words to describe this miss. @entity203 does n't do it justice			1
@entity206 is n't strong enough			0
this is , quite simply , atrocious			0
@entity200 of @entity199 certainly wo n't be living this down for a good few years to come			0
in at number one , @entity199 's @entity200 manages to put the ball over the bar from a yard out			0

@entity12 's miss against @entity44 makes the list
@entity19 appears with an *exceptional* miss from a free - kick
@entity14 is on the countdown not once , but twice
@entity15 counts down the top 10 misses in the @entity17 in 2014
