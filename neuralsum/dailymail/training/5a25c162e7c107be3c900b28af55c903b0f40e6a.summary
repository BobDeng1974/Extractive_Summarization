at the top of a winding @entity2 mountain road is the entrance to @entity4 , a 1970s theme park abandoned less than 10 years after it opened			1
in its heyday the @entity8 could attract 20,000 visitors a day , but now the neglected @entity11 is missing some bricks , the @entity7 's castle is empty and the @entity13 has disappeared			0
in the same way the @entity15 created the @entity13 to wow his subjects , entrepreneur @entity14 dreamed up the @entity19 theme park as a way of attracting families - and money - to the resort town			2
in its first summer 400,000 visitors came to the @entity8 the park was designed originally to walk tourists through the story , starting with the farmhouse , where @entity46 could be found in the kitchen using local craftsmen and entertainers , @entity49 and designer @entity48 built their grand interpretation of the popular 1939 film over 450 acres			1
the @entity11 wound its way through the park , leading tourists to a replica @entity13			0
@entity62 's house , the castle of the @entity7 and the @entity60 village were all faithfully recreated			1
the men behind the project even set up a balloon ride made out of a ski lift , so that visitors would get a winged - monkey 's eye view of the park nestled in the mountains before they were whisked back to the real world			1
the park opened on june 15 , 1970 by @entity39 , accompanied by her then little - known daughter , @entity40			2
in its first summer 400,000 visitors came to the @entity8 , according to @entity74			1
sadly , however , @entity14 never lived to see his masterpiece , dying at the age of 50 of bone cancer only six months before the park opened in 1970			2
more tragedy was to beset the park , when a fire destroyed @entity13 and part of the museum collection , including dresses worn by @entity85 in the movie			0
visitor numbers started to dwindle and finally , ten years after its opening day brought in 20,000 visitors , the @entity8 closed its gates			1
as the sound effects of a tornado began , tourists would be ushered into to the storm shelter with one of several dorothys who worked at the park weeds have been cleared from the @entity11 , the fountain and waterfall have been repaired and , proving that there really is no place like home keep out : the gates to @entity4 , which attracted 400,000 visitors in its first summer , closed ten years after the park started theatrical : local entertainers would play the parts of characters in the beloved film , greeting families as they explored the mountain resort theme park abandoned and forgotten , the park became a target for vandals and thieves , who destroyed or stole props in the park , including entire houses			1

a door in the cellar would then open on to a tilted version of the farmhouse , to recreate the storm damage , and a pair of striped stockings and ruby red slippers of the @entity144 , would greet the visitors as they left the house			0
however , characters carved into the trees lining the now uneven @entity11 and stone characters scattered throughout the @entity60 village appear ghoulish in the abandoned park , and the witch 's castle looms eerily in the mountain mist			1
all hope is not lost for the @entity8 though			0
in the 1990s project @entity156 was started by a group of kind - hearted volunteers who , with a little bit of the @entity162 's courage and the @entity164 's brains , have slowly restored the park			0
popular : @entity85 as @entity62 in the @entity15 , released in 1939			0
one of her dresses and props from the film were in a museum at the park lost in time : @entity172 was once filled with families exploring the mountain park , but its exhibits , like the @entity60 village , right , are now eerily deserted weeds have been cleared from the @entity11 , the fountain and waterfall have been repaired and , proving that there really is no place like home , @entity62 's house has been converted into a cosy cottage , which can be rented to holiday - makers			1
' each summer we add something back to @entity4 sometimes it is original items returned to us from caring friends			0
one of my proudest moments was hauling back to @entity4 what i believe to be the very last balloon in existence , ' @entity191 , who helps look after the park , said			1
tourists are still welcome at the @entity8 where they have the option of hiring a costume and going in search of the @entity13			0
the park also holds a two - day festival each year , with a guided tour through the park , a picnic at the @entity209 farmhouse and , for an additional $ 100 , a whirlwind visit from @entity62 herself .			2

fire and death forced park to close ten years after it opened in 1970
park based on popular @entity219 theme attracted 400,000 visitors in its first summer
tourists could explore @entity62 's farmhouse , meet the characters and depart in a *special* hot air balloon ride
vandals and thieves damaged @entity4 , as it lay forgotten on top of a mountain resort
