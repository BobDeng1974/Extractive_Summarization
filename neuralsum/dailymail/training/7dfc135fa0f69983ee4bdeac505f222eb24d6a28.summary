by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 28 march 2014 updated : 17:30 est , 28 march 2014 my garden has evolved slowly over the past 20 years but about 15 years ago we made a decision , based upon the wet , grey winters , to create an elaborate and strong structure using mainly box - @entity7 sempervirens			1
box is one of our few native evergreens and has been used since @entity11 as the perfect plant to train into a low , evergreen hedge that only needs clipping once a year to hold its shape well			1
it ’s expensive to buy - so i began the process of raising thousands of plants from cuttings			2
slowly , these became strong plants and the miles of box hedging began to create the vibrant structure i wanted , even in the middle of the darkest days of winter			1
@entity0 has had trouble with box blight that causes the interior of box plants to die back box is - was - famously tough and trouble - free			1
the plants i raised were - i believed - set to last for scores , even hundreds of years of unhindered growth			1
but two years ago i noticed one area had started to die back			1
@entity35 will we get any fruit from our three - year - old peach tree this year ? @entity38 , @entity39			2
peach trees usually fruit after three to five years			1
they need to be in well - drained , fertile soil in the sunniest position possible			2
mulch liberally each spring with garden compost and water generously once a week			0
do not prune other than to remove any dead or damaged branches			0
q. the box cuttings i took last autumn and have kept in an unheated greenhouse still have no roots			1
what 's wrong ? mrs @entity53 , @entity54			0
a timely question given my box problems			1
cuttings taken last autumn will not show any growth until this spring			0
leave them in the pots until september , by which time they should have formed roots			0
carefully remove and plant them out			0
and watch out for box blight ! @entity35 how do i pleach my hornbeam hedge ? @entity67 , @entity68			1
do you really mean ' pleach ' - a pleached hedge has bare trunks with the hedge raised up in the air - or ' lay ' ? a laid hedge should be about 3.3m ( 10ft ) tall , with the trunks cut through until only flaps of bark remain , then woven between upright stakes			1
the plants of a pleached hedge should be placed at 2m ( 6ft 6in ) intervals , then trained onto a wire or bamboo structure			1
keep clipping the sides hard to encourage lateral growth , then tie this into the supporting structure			0
it takes about ten years to achieve a fully formed pleached hornbeam hedge			1
the green foliage was turning grey and brown and collapsing in a mouldy mess			0
otherwise unaffected leaves were showing chocolate coloured stains			0
i knew at once that this was one of my worst nightmares - the dreaded box blight			1
there are two forms of box blight , @entity102 and @entity103 , both fungi that cause the interior of box plants to die back			1
both types of fungi need humid , warm conditions to thrive and the past few years have been perfect for their spread			2
@entity111 needs open wounds - like those created every time box is clipped - to infect the host plant , whereas @entity116 can infect unwounded plants and is the more pernicious of the two , affecting quite woody stems as well as the foliage			2
the worst damage appears in august and september - and when it arrives the plants can die back in a matter of days			0
the best solution is to cut out all affected growth - and burn it			0
gather up all fallen leaves and remove the top layer of mulch or soil that can harbour spores			0
from the first patch i noticed in september 2012 the blight has ripped through our box hedges , leaving the crisp green ravaged with bare , brown patches			1
some of these will regrow but will almost certainly be hit again in a cycle that will eventually kill the plants			0
the crispness and the green is never again going to be re- created by these box plants			2
it is possible that all the box in the garden will be blighted , including the 64 box balls that i treasure dearly			2
we have some hedges of @entity7 sempervirens ‘ @entity150 ’ that have coarser , thicker leaves which are more resistant - but still get affected			0
so we are taking drastic action to try to limit the spread			0
badly affected hedges are being dug up and burnt - the work of 15 years going up in flames			1
what do we do ? plants that are clearly untouched are being taken to a piece of land 30 miles away that has no box - so no blight - and placed in quarantine for a full calendar year			1
any box that is not hedging is having the affected growth cut right back in the hope that the regrowth will be unaffected			2
the chances are slim but it is worth trying			0
we could replace the low box hedges with a substitute evergreen plant like @entity174 , euonymus , pittisporum or myrtle			2
none of these appeal to me and i am inclined to embrace the forced change and see it as a creative opportunity			0
however , the taller hedges - 1m ( 3ft ) high and more - would look just as good in yew , which grows very well here and now is the perfect time to plant it			0
so one door closes - with a slam - but as ever in a garden , another opens .			0

@entity0 has spent 15 years growing an *ornamental* hedge
a fungal *disease* called box blight has since *destroyed* the project
