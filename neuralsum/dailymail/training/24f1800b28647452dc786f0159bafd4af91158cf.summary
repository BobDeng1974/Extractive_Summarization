@entity1 's gold @entity0 is expected to launch at a ' small ' event in @entity3 on 16 october - a week earlier than first thought despite claims @entity1 has been gearing up to launch its new range of @entity0 on 21 october , we may get to see the devices a week earlier			1
tech site re / code claims the launch event will now take place on 16 october at @entity1 's @entity3 headquarters			1
if these reports are true , the @entity0 could go on sale on the 24 october			0
last week , rumours suggested @entity1 was putting the finishing touches to a new version of it 's @entity19 - including a gold version			2
the small event is likely to be in stark contrast to the star - studded launch of the @entity24 , which saw @entity25 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band 's new album			2
the move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full - size tablets , which are in decline			0
until now , @entity0 have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme , but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the @entity39 company ’s new @entity24 and @entity37 , which come in three colours			2
new versions of the 9.7 - inch tablet could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the @entity19 , ‘ people familiar with the matter ’ told @entity46			2
the new @entity0 are also predicted to sport a thinner , more rounded design , similar to the @entity24 6			1
hidden code in the latest @entity52 beta software hints that the @entity0 will feature a @entity54 fingerprint sensor and @entity56 functionality			1
the code states that users can ' pay with @entity0 using @entity54			0
with @entity56 , you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information			0
' however , it is not clear whether the new @entity0 will come with @entity63 functionality , which is used for contactless payments , as it relies on a @entity65 or mobile connection			0
@entity56 has only been announced in the @entity67 , so if the @entity0 do get the feature , it may be limited to only @entity67 buyers			2
until now , @entity0 have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme , but a golden makeover would make the tablets - available in silver and space grey - more similar to the @entity39 company ’s new @entity24 and @entity37 , which come in three colours ( pictured ) @entity1 is preparing to launch a range of imacs with @entity79 in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales			1
the firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its @entity86 software called @entity87 , and news @entity0 this month			1
' a new line of imacs with ultra high - resolution @entity91 is in late testing stages within @entity1 , according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer , ' said 9to5 @entity86 ' while the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design , which was introduced in 2012 , it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved @entity65 antennas , ' it says			2
the firm will also launch a new version of its @entity86 software called @entity87			1
the @entity87 software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their @entity86 - even if their @entity24 is in another room			1
the software has also been overhauled with a new ' flat ' look , and can search the web without having to open a browser			0
@entity1 is also rumoured to be launching a larger ipad with a 12.9 - inch screen next year , which if true , could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models			1
the latest swathe of @entity1 tablets could come with a split screen function , which would allow users of an @entity0 to open two apps side - by - side on one screen			1
sales of @entity0 have slumped for two quarters , after climbing from $ 5 billion ( £ 3 billion ) when they were launched in 2010 , to $ 30 billion ( £ 19 billion ) in 2012 and $ 32 billion in 2013 ( £ 20 billion )			0
the firm has n't unveiled an updated @entity0 since last october when it launched the @entity19 and @entity132 , and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens , including recently , @entity1 ’s @entity37 , which has a 5.5 inch screen			1
@entity1 is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales			0
in 1999 it rolled out different coloured imacs which were successful , but sales of its @entity142 – a ‘ budget ’ version of the @entity143 – have not sold as well as the company hoped			0
