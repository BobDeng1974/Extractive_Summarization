but instead of a blaze on board , the alert seems to have been triggered by extra ' humidity ' coming from some 390 cows being carried on the plane			1
the @entity11 landing at @entity12 is one of 88 mayday calls reported to the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) last year			1
a pilot was forced to make an emergency mayday landing when a fire warning light came on in his cargo plane			2
but the false alarm was triggered by cows on board a mayday landing is the highest level of emergency and is rarely used except in the most urgent cases			2
other reasons for using the international distress signal included low fuel levels , suspected terrorism and crew members being struck down with food poisoning and becoming unable to safely man the plane			0
a spokesman for the @entity15 , which has released details of the calls , said it was a pilot â€™s discretion to call a mayday based on an assessment of a given situation on board the aircraft			2
he said : ' it could be the result of some technical failure to the aircraft or a passenger being unwell			0
' the pilot will declare the mayday to air traffic control and communicate the nature of the situation			0
' the air traffic controller may then give the aircraft a priority landing and scramble airport fire and rescue service or medical assistance if required			0
' in this case the fire alert was triggered while flying over the @entity60 sea			1
according to the report a worried crew member was sent onto the main deck to investigate but saw no sign of smoke or fire			0
but following procedure they donned oxygen masks and started ' a controlled cabin depressurisation and rapid descent ' - an emergency landing after extensive checks on the aircraft , the pilot said he believed that the presence of the cattle led to higher levels of humidity on board			1
cows are well known for producing high levels of methane gas - the second - most - significant heat - trapping emission			1
other alerts saw an @entity86 send out a mayday call as it reached @entity12 after the crew were told bags which had been loaded were for passengers not on board , sparking a bomb fear the alert seems to have been triggered by extra ' humidity ' coming from some 390 flatulent cows being carried on the plane it was a false alarm			1
two more planes coming into @entity100 thought they were running out of fuel , with the crew of one so concerned , they sent an alert to be given priority landing			2
the captain of a @entity106 was unable to continue flying after falling ill so the crew issued a mayday emergency call			0
the plane was landed safely at @entity110 by the co-pilot			0
another 737 made and emergency landing shortly after take - off when the plane started to shake and there was a burning smell in the cabin			2
it was revealed to be a failed air conditioning unit			0
an emergency was declared on a @entity120 plane coming into @entity121 after the co-pilot became sick with food poisoning			0
and a @entity125 jumbo jet had to dump its fuel and make an emergency landing back at @entity12 after one of its engines caught fire on take off .			1

*baffled* crew had to don gas masks and make emergency landing after the alert was triggered over @entity60 sea
it was later revealed to have been set off by 390 cows in the cargo hold
cows produce high levels of methane gas - the second - most - significant heat - trapping emission
@entity11 landing at @entity12 is one of 88 mayday calls reported to the @entity15
