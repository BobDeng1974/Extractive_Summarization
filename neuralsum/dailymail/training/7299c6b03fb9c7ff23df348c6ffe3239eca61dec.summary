published : 10:32 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 02:48 est , 1 march 2013 mobile phones are the fastest growing area of @entity3 's business - yet co-founder @entity4 has said he thinks they are ' emasculating ' users			1
the @entity3 boss told a stunned audience at the @entity9 conference in @entity10 he believed phone users were ' hunched up , looking down , rubbing a featureless piece of glass '			1
' it ’s kind of emasculating , ' he said			2
' is this what you ’re meant to do with your body ? ' @entity3 co-founder @entity4 wearing his @entity21 computer			1
today he said the experience of using a smartphone was ' emasculating ' he claims the answer , perhaps unsurprisingly , is @entity3 's much - publicised @entity21 project , a £ 1,000 wearable computer set to go on sale this year			1
' when we started @entity3 15 years ago , ' @entity4 said , ' my vision was that information would come to you as you need it			1
fears are brewing that the next generation of wearable mobile devices , like @entity3 's @entity21 , could pose a serious cancer risk			1
the futuristic @entity3 gadget is practically useless unless it is connected to the internet to deliver search results , provide turn - by - turn directions , and upload images			1
to connect on its own , this would require them to be fitted with cellular radios , which emit radiation that studies have claimed could be carcinogenic			1
prototypes of @entity21 do not have the ability to connect to mobile networks themselves			2
the face - based computers can only access the internet through a wireless bluetooth connection to the wearer 's smart phone			2
that could be because the power draw of cellular radios is so high that fitting one would require a heavy battery			2
but the jury is still out on claims that the frequencies they use may be carcinogenic			2
previous studies have found low - level electromagnetic field exposure from mobiles and other transmitting devices could cause harmful heating of tissue , male infertility and cancer			2
' you would n’t have to search query at all			2
' however , he claims the reality has proved to be very different			2
' is this the way you ’re meant to interact with other people ? is the future of connection just people walking around hunched up , looking down , rubbing a featureless piece of glass ? ' ' it ’s kind of emasculating			1
is this what you ’re meant to do with your body ? ' @entity4 also revealed his own mobile phone addiction during the talk			1
' i have a nervous tic , ' he said			1
' the cell phone is a nervous habit			1
if i smoked , i ’d probably smoke instead , it ’d look cooler			2
' but i whip this out and look as if i have something important to do			0
' it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent secluding myself away in email			0
' @entity4 's comments have also provoked anger online			0
' we ’re taking advice on cool from this guy ? seriously ? ' said @entity109 on the tech blog daringfireball.net			1
' i can see the argument that dicking around with our phones in public is not cool , that we should pay more attention to our companions and surroundings , and less to our computer displays			1
' strapping a computer display to your face is not the answer			0
' some also believe @entity4 simply used the wrong word			0
' if only there were some kind of electronic search service that @entity4 could use to look up the meaning of ' emasculating ' , ' said @entity128 sociology professor @entity127 on twitter			0
@entity4 wears @entity21 glasses at an announcement for the @entity132 - he is rarely pictured without them			0
@entity4 also warned fans keen to get their hands on @entity21 not to trust @entity137 listing purporting to offer prototypes for the augmented reality spectacles			0
his comments came after a seller on the auction site put up what was claimed to be an early version of the gadget with a reserve of nearly $ 16,000			1
' i would trust @entity137 , by the way , but not that particular post , ' he said			0
mr @entity4 also had good news for those keenly awaiting the launch of @entity21 , with a promise that it would be available to the public for less than $ 1,500 later this year			0
@entity3 has revealed for the first time what wearers of its @entity21 computer will see			1
here , a message is received and displayed on screen			0
users can speak to reply the new video reveals how @entity3 glass could be used - including this video chat between a users holding a snake and a young child shocked by the animal the hotly anticipated glasses allow wearers to see sat - nav directions , take pictures and reply to emails - but until last week @entity3 had refused to show how they actually work			1
' want to see how @entity21 actually feels ? it 's surprisingly simple , ' @entity3 said			1
' say ' take a picture ' to take a picture			0
' record what you see , hands free			0
even share what you see , live			0
directions are right in front of you			0
the firm also said all of the footage was captured through @entity21			0
@entity21 will come in five colours - black , gray , blue , red or white and have removable shades			0
the company is negotiating with @entity192 , an e-commerce start - up company that sells trendy eyeglasses , to help it design more fashionable frames , according to the @entity195 .			0
