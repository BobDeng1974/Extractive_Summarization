with @entity0 planning to reduce its reliance on oil , work into solar power is gaining a foothold			1
and now one group of @entity0 students is hoping to showcase their research by driving a solar - powered car through the @entity10 heartland			1
a 19 - strong team is preparing to bring its @entity13 car - which translates to @entity14 - to compete in the @entity15 in july			1

its 15ft ( 4.5m ) carbon fibre chassis resembles a giant door			0
the four wheels that lurk beneath its sprawling white body ( pictured ) are the only clue it is a car at all top speed : 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) weight : 485lb ( 220 kg ) dimensions : 15ft ( 4.5m ) long , 6ft ( 1.8m ) wide and 4ft ( 1.1 m ) tall solar cells : 65 square feet ( 6 square meters ) batteries : @entity29 - can keep car going for four hours powered by the sun , its 15ft ( 4.5 metre ) carbon fibre chassis resembles a giant door			1

last month , the flat , rectangular vehicle was tested alongside slightly larger gas - powered motor vehicles on a stretch of highway in @entity0 's mountainous north			1
with final preparations now in place , the group plans to compete in an eight - day , 1,700 - mile ( 2,700 - kilometre ) race that will take it from @entity48 , @entity49 to @entity50 , @entity51			1
the flat , rectangular vehicle was tested alongside slightly larger gas - powered motor vehicles last month on a stretch of highway in @entity0 's mountainous north with final preparations now in place , the group plans to compete in an eight - day , 1,700 - mile ( 2,700 - kilometre ) race that will take it from @entity48 , @entity49 to @entity50 , @entity51 @entity0 is ramping up its renewable energy efforts according to the @entity0 energy minister , @entity59			1
the country ’s goal is to add 5,000 mw of new solar energy and wind energy capacity by the year 2018			2
professor @entity64 , who manages the @entity13 team , said he believes the project could help advance the cause of clean energy in a country where generous state subsidies have encouraged massive use of motor vehicles			0
‘ our young scholars and university students can significantly contribute to @entity0 's economic growth , particularly in the field of clean energies that can help us reduce dependency on oil , ’ he said			2
earlier this year , @entity82 cut a portion of its energy and fuel subsidies in order to bring prices closer to international levels - nearly doubling some prices at the pump			1
subsidies have kept the cost of petrol artificially low , and were blamed for making it cheaper than bottled mineral water			0
the cuts aim to release government money for production and infrastructural projects in order to improve efficiency and bolster the economy			0
transportation expert @entity103 said solar energy could potentially be a good investment for the government , given that the country has more than 300 sunny days a year to power the cells			2
the @entity109 reached a top speed of 70 mph ( 110 kilometres per hour ) during testing , but the team believes it is capable of 100 mph ( 160 kilometres per hour ) in competition			1
@entity115 , 20 , in charge of electronics on the project , from @entity119 near @entity82 , said the team plan to optimise the car 's absorption of solar energy based on the route it takes			1
‘ we first do a simulation of the actual race course and study the weather conditions there			0
then we try to calculate what the sun 's angles would be during the eight - days , ’ she said			0
the 485lb ( 220 kg ) vehicle is 15ft ( 4.5m ) long , 6ft ( 1.8m ) wide and 4ft ( 1.1 m ) tall , with a cockpit - like canopy for the driver			0
with photovoltaic cells covering some 65 square feet ( 6 square meters ) of its surface , the car 's lithium - ion batteries can drive it up to four hours			2
located 100 miles ( 160 kilometres ) from the capital , @entity142 has 300 days of sunshine a year			0
good roads stretch for miles across a largely barren desert landscape			0
to ensure a level playing field in the @entity10 , all teams will rely on 516 photovoltaic panels , or solar cells , made in @entity10 and patched together in @entity151			2
but each entrant has developed their own @entity154 ( @entity154 ) system , which connects inverters , battery chargers and other devices to optimise the car 's performance			0
the skill and key to winning is understanding the course and detecting the angles of the sun 's rays during a day 's racing , starting at 9am and ending at 6pm local time , with each team using four drivers			0
@entity115 ( left ) , 20 , in charge of electronics on the project from @entity119 , said they plan to optimise the car 's absorption of solar energy based on the route it plans to take the @entity109 reached a top speed of 70 mph ( 110 kilometres per hour ) during testing , but the team believes it is capable of 99 mph ( 160 kilometres per hour ) in competition the car 's predecessor , the @entity186 - 1 , ranked 17th in the 2011 @entity187 in @entity188			1
but while a host of technical challenges may have been overcome , the students now have a far bigger problem – sending the car to the @entity10 ‘ we are really worried about it , ’ said @entity194 , the mechanical leader of the team from @entity196 , west of @entity82			1
‘ to think that we might not make it is almost too terrible to contemplate			0
’ standing in their path are the sanctions imposed on @entity0 for a nuclear programme that some believe masks an intention to develop an atomic bomb			1
the restrictions make transporting the @entity186 - 2 by air cargo a logistical nightmare			1
‘ this car has made us crazy , ’ said @entity211 , the team 's electronics specialist who has now switched his attention to trying to find an air carrier			1
‘ i wish governments across the world would accept we are researchers , not terrorists			0
’ students from the @entity196 , west of @entity82 , assemble the solar powered havin - 2 vehicle for a test drive			1
with photovoltaic cells covering some 65 square feet ( 6 square meters ) of its surface , the car 's lithium - ion batteries can drive it up to four hours while a host of technical challenges may have been overcome , the students now have a far bigger problem – sending the car to the @entity10 sanctions on @entity0 make transporting the @entity186 - 2 by air cargo difficult the cargo arms of @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 all refused to carry the @entity186 - 2 , citing fears of breaching sanctions			1
a letter from the @entity241 appears to confirm that the car does not require special authorisation if is being used ‘ in a public conference , performance , exhibition or similar event ’			0
the solar challenge organisers , however , were unable to navigate the regulations			0
‘ it has been very difficult , ’ said @entity250 , the event 's team coordinator			0
‘ we went to a senator , who directed us to the @entity255 who then sent us to the @entity257			0
ultimately , i guess we were not a high priority case			0
’ last ditch negotiations with a @entity82 - based carrier are now underway			1
even then , a delivery date no later than 1 july , which the carrier is reluctant to guarantee , leaves less than two weeks for the @entity263 to clear customs in time for the start of the race			2
the @entity0 team is confident it can hold its own against the mostly @entity10 field , which includes the @entity270 ( @entity270 )			2
beyond the solar challenge 's aim of promoting clean energy , a sense of national pride is also palpable among mr @entity194 and mr @entity211 , who both took part in the same event in @entity188 three years ago			2
‘ we want to show we are good , maybe even better than the rest of the world , ’ mr @entity211 said			0
the @entity0 team is confident it can hold its own against the mostly @entity10 field , which includes the @entity270 ( @entity270 )			2

havin - 2 car is hoping to compete in the @entity15 in july
the eight - day , 1,700 - mile race will take the car from @entity48 to @entity51
car can reach a speed of 100 mph using solar panels to generate energy
but sanctions on @entity0 make transporting the @entity186 - 2 by air cargo difficult
last ditch negotiations with a @entity82 - based carrier are now under way
