by @entity0 for @entity1 the routes of two urban cycleways across @entity4 billed as ‘ @entity5 for the bike ’ were today unveiled by mayor @entity7			0
they will offer cyclists protection from other road traffic and are the centrepiece of a £ 913million project to get more londoners on to two wheels			0
the north - south route will run for more than three miles from @entity16 in south @entity4 to @entity17 in north @entity4			1

protected cycle routes will also be created through dangerous junctions , including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity23 and @entity38			1
connections will be created to cycle routes serving other parts of the @entity41 , @entity42 and suburbs			1
subject to detailed public consultation - which begins today - work will start early next year and the routes will open in march 2016			2

last autumn six cyclists were killed on @entity4 's roads in two weeks , leading to calls for more money to be invested in cycle lanes and safety measures			2
at the time , former @entity147 cyclist @entity146 asked mr @entity7 to look at banning heavy good vehicles from the roads during peak hours			0
this is a system already implemented in @entity152			0
out of 14 cyclists killed last year in @entity4 , nine were involved in accidents with @entity155			0
at @entity96 , one of the areas being redeveloped in the plans , seven cyclists are said to have died since 2008 - the latest being in april this year			0
the @entity161 would start at @entity36 , where it would connect to the existing @entity162 ( @entity163 ) , which runs east to @entity164 and @entity26			1
from @entity36 , the new route would run along @entity166 and @entity167 , @entity51 , across @entity23 , to @entity168 and through @entity168 , across @entity38 and up @entity169			1
from there , it will travel on the @entity172 from @entity173 to @entity174 and would continue along the @entity175 as far as @entity176 , @entity27			2
the @entity177 would start at @entity36 , where it would connect to the existing @entity162 ( @entity163 ) the design of the section from the @entity30 to @entity27 is still being finalised and will be consulted on at a later date			1
apart from a short stretch in the @entity38 area and a low traffic street adjacent to @entity167 tunnel , the new superhighway would be entirely physically segregated			0
in central @entity4 , there will be connecting @entity188 backstreet routes to other parts of the @entity41 , the @entity42 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and many other places			0
there will also be connections to an upgraded @entity161 2 for @entity196 and @entity197			0
from @entity36 , the new route would run along @entity166 and @entity167 , @entity51 and across @entity23 there will also be connections to the existing segregated track across @entity201 , connecting to @entity202 and @entity188 routes in @entity56			1
connections are proposed at the western end to @entity206 , @entity27 , @entity207 and @entity209 town centres and to the @entity211 trading estate			2
proposals for cycling infrastructure improvements on @entity214 will also be covered as part of the @entity217 scheme at @entity218			0
our wish is for segregation for cyclists on the bridge , subject to this being feasible			0
from @entity169 , it will travel on the @entity172 from @entity173 to @entity174 and would continue along the @entity175 the @entity226 would start at @entity16 , where it would connect to the existing @entity228 ( @entity229 ) at @entity230			2
from @entity16 the @entity231 would run along @entity232 , through @entity55 , along @entity91 and cross @entity233 before connecting to the proposed @entity177 on the north bank of the @entity48			1
from @entity16 the @entity231 would run along @entity232 , through @entity55 , and along @entity91 it is planned to then continue to @entity17 using @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity236 and quieter backstreet roads			1
the southern section between @entity16 and @entity236 station would be a largely continuous segregated two - way cycle track			1
@entity242 , where @entity236 is not wide enough for segregation in both directions , the route will use low - traffic back streets and / or segregation in one direction , subject to further consultation with the @entity249 , the highway authority			1
source : @entity20 it is planned to continue to @entity17 using @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity236 and quieter backstreet roads			0

@entity242 - south route of @entity257 's cycleway will run for more than three miles from @entity16 to @entity17
east - west route will run from @entity26 to @entity27 , a distance of over 18 miles , including section on @entity30 flyover
protected cycle routes will be created through junctions including @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity23
