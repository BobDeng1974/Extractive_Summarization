by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is poised to hand @entity3 - and @entity4 - a huge boost by returning to action three weeks ahead of schedule against @entity8 on saturday			1
but @entity9 is facing a fresh injury blow with the news that midfielder @entity12 faces weeks on the sidelines with a knee problem which could require surgery			1
skipper @entity2 was expected to be absent for three months after sustaining a hamstring problem in july			1
however , as he prepares to hand debuts to strikers @entity19 and @entity20 against the @entity8 at @entity21 , @entity9 says @entity2 ’s quicker - than - expected return feels like having another new player			1
‘ @entity2 looks very well			1
he could maybe play on saturday , ’ said the @entity3 boss			1
@entity3 's @entity2 could return from injury three weeks early against @entity8 on saturday ‘ we are talking here about new signings but to also get injured players back is great			1
‘ everybody knows how important @entity2 is to this team			1
he looks good and needs minutes under his belt			2
‘ it ’s tough to get players the minutes they need at the top level to get their fitness back			2
but when we do that i see a very good team here			2
’ @entity2 sustained his injury in a pre-season match against @entity39 and initial projections predicted a three - month lay - off			1
his comeback will also be welcomed by national team @entity43 ahead of next month ’s @entity46 double header with @entity47 and @entity48 , with @entity9 reporting : ‘ @entity2 is training with the team well now			1
it ’s positive and his body is improving quick so that ’s good			2
’ @entity55 was expected to be out for three months after sustaining a hamstring problem in july the news is less positive for @entity9 and @entity43 on @entity12 , @entity2 ’s club and country midfield partner			1
after watching @entity12 sent off in contentious circumstances by a @entity62 referee in @entity4 ’s 2 - 1 defeat to @entity64 last sunday , @entity9 only wishes the red card flashed by his countryman had come earlier than the last minute			1
‘ @entity12 is struggling with his knee now			1
i do n’t know how long that is going to take to get better			2
‘ it could be some weeks			2
he has a meniscus problem with his knee and it could need surgery , but i hope we do n’t need to do that			2
’ pleased to have a settled squad after the drama of transfer deadline day , @entity9 promises new faces against @entity79 ’ @entity8 side			1
@entity81 said @entity2 needed minutes under his belt after such a long lay - off @entity84 will also be restored to the first - team squad after bids for his services from @entity88 and @entity89 were rejected – to the defender ’s chagrin			1
left out of the 1 - 1 draw with @entity94 as a result , the @entity92 spoke to @entity9 yesterday and assured fans the defender ’s head is in the right place for the season ahead			2
‘ he ( @entity101 ) is very happy now			2
he ’s just become a dad and he ’s been with his national team for the first time			2
‘ he was a little bit disappointed for a couple of days after the window closed			2
people want things and he was thinking he had the opportunity to go to the @entity111			0
‘ but that was n’t possible and he knows now he has a lot of challenges here as well			0
he is a very important player for @entity3 and he has to take it as a positive			1
the way i saw him in training today , he has taken it fantastically well			0
‘ he has to understand how important he is			0
he is such an unbelievably good player for us			0
that ’s something he has to be glad about			0
we would have said : “ go away , we do n’t want you			0
” that would have been worse			0
’ @entity4 and @entity3 's @entity12 ( right ) could require knee surgery in a blow for the club @entity9 admits @entity3 had to play hardball on deadline day , adding : ‘ there was interest in him			1
but it was not even close to what we are thinking about			0
also , we were not interested in selling him anyway			0
he is one of the players we are going to build a new team around			0
‘ he has n’t said anything to me about speaking about it again in january			0
again , you can never plan in football			0
tomorrow , he could be injured or he could start playing fantastic and become a regular in the national team for @entity143			0
‘ he has things to work on to get improvement			0
he played very well against @entity146 , the standard he played was @entity149 level			0
that ’s why he was picked for @entity143			0
so if he continues that , he will get his chances			0
‘ he said that to me as well , that if he plays good matches for @entity3 , he will get opportunities			1
‘ i have no concerns about his commitment			0
i can honestly say i ’m really happy about his situation and have no concerns			0
i can see his body language and he is happy			0
now he is focused on getting good results with @entity3 and getting better			1
