chancellor @entity0 has failed to reduce welfare spending by as much as planned the elderly receive £ 500 more every year from their state pension than they did four years ago , says a report			1
but the fact pensions have increased has slashed the savings the government had pledged to make in public spending			2
controversial cuts aimed at reducing the welfare bill have failed to save taxpayers the sums promised by ministers , the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) said			1
this is partly due to more generous pension benefits introduced at the same time as the cuts			0
over the past four years , chancellor @entity0 has unveiled cuts to tax credits and benefits aimed at saving £ 19billion a year			1
but spending on welfare will be just £ 2.5billion less this year than it was in 2010 - 11 in real terms			1
ministers are likely to come under pressure to make further savings after the @entity9 suggested the government had over-estimated the amount its cuts would save			1
the @entity9 said the savings gap was partly due to a more generous state pension , seen as an attempt by @entity32 to win the ‘ grey vote ’			1
meagre pay rises in recent years have also left many workers reliant on housing benefits and working tax credits , pushing up welfare bills			0
the @entity9 said that when adjusted for inflation , @entity39 had saved £ 2.5billion this year compared with four years ago			2
the report ’s author , economist @entity41 , said : ‘ mr @entity0 wants further cuts to social security spending to help reduce the deficit			2
but he may end up having to make cuts just to stay on track			0
’ the @entity9 said that while some benefits such as @entity51 ’ @entity49 had been cut , pensioner benefits had risen			0
the state pension bill has gone up sharply because of a number of changes including the ‘ triple lock ’ , introduced two years ago			1
the lock guarantees price rises in line with earnings , inflation or 2.5 per cent – whichever is the highest – to protect oaps from paltry increases			0
but this will cost an additional £ 45billion over the next 15 years according to estimates			0
the @entity9 think - tank also said the @entity39 ’s housing benefit bill will be £ 1billion higher in 2014 – 15 than it was in 2010 – 11 , despite promises it would be slashed by £ 2billion			1
the rising state pension has contributed to a £ 5billion increase in spending on @entity73 welfare , a new study has revealed this was blamed on poor wage growth and rising rent prices , leaving many reliant on handouts to make ends meet			1
poor pay rises also meant the government had to pay more in working tax credits for employees on low salaries			0
cuts of £ 4.6billion to tax credits were announced , but will drop by £ 2.7billion compared with 2010 - 11 , the @entity9 said			1
the report also blamed ‘ significant ’ delays in implementing changes to the disability living allowance ( @entity90 )			0
the government had predicted cuts of £ 1.2billion , but the study said @entity90 spending would actually rise by £ 1.6billion			2
mr @entity41 said : ‘ the government have n’t implemented all the cuts that they announced			0
‘ but more importantly other things like the number of pensioners and low - paid people have pushed up spending in real terms			2
’ however falling unemployment meant the @entity51 ’ allowance bill dropped by £ 1.3billion , much more than the £ 100million ministers had pledged to cut .			0

@entity0 pledged to slash £ 19bn off the welfare and pensions *budget*
