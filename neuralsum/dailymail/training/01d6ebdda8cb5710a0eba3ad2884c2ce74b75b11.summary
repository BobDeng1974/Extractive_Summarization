by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:16 est , 28 february 2014 it may not quite have the glamour or glitz of the latest @entity7 blockbuster , but this blurry footage of an engineer standing in front of a camera is likely to be the first film ever shot in @entity13			1
revealed by @entity15 and called ' @entity16 ' , it was created by engineers @entity17 and @entity19 as they worked on the first device for viewing moving pictures			2
they made the movie for @entity24 in 1889 or 1890 while working with @entity25 to develop and test the @entity26 , an early motion picture viewing device considered to be the precursor to movie projectors			1
the @entity26 is an early motion picture exhibition device designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of the device			1
the @entity26 was not a movie projector but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video , by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high - speed shutter			1
first described in conceptual terms by @entity13 inventor @entity25 in 1888 , it was largely developed by his employee @entity19 between 1889 and 1892			2
the full film , 56 seconds long , shows a lab worker ' horsing around ' in front of the camera , and @entity15 today released this animated gif version in tribute to the pair			1
the shots are an experimental film made to test the original cylinder format of the @entity26			1
the films were intended to be internal tests of the new camera system , and were not created for commercial use , their rise to prominence resulted much later due to work by film historians			0
however , film buffs have never been able to prove who @entity13 's first film star was			0
scholars have differing opinions on whether the first was shot in june 1889 starring @entity74 or sometime between november 21 - 27 , 1890 starring @entity75			0
both men were fellow lab workers at the company			0

a series of three were made , before the team moved onto other projects			0
all three films show a blurry figure in white standing in one place making large gestures and are only a few seconds long			0
