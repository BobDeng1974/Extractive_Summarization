is this the death knell for florescent @entity2 pillows ? a doctor from @entity4 , @entity5 , thinks he 's come up with a solution to every traveller 's worst problem ; sleeping on the move			1
after suffering a sports related injury which made sleeping on trains , planes or in cars hellish , dr @entity10 decided to invent something more supportive than what was already on the market			1
the result is @entity20 , a disc - shaped head support pillow that starts out life as a flat disc about one inch thick			1
sweet dreams : dr @entity10 decided to invent a better support after suffering a sports related injury @entity20 costs $ 59 ( £ 36 ) and comes in different colours including cobalt , lime ( left ) and cream ( right ) you twist it into shape , pull the shoulder strap on to hold it in place then rest your head on the foam structure which moulds slightly to your face and neck			1
it 's small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag and works by allowing the muscles in your neck to relax			0
whether your on your daily commute or cradling a sleeping a baby and keen to catch up on forty winks yourself , this could be your saviour			0
@entity20 costs $ 59 ( £ 36 ) each and comes in different colours including cobalt , lime , cream and crimson			2
@entity10 raised $ 67,819 ( £ 42,000 ) for his project on @entity56 - smashing his $ 40,000 ( £ 25,000 ) goal			1
he wrote on his pitch : ' have you ever fallen asleep upright , perhaps while traveling , and awakened with neck discomfort ? me too ! ' like many , i would use a u-shaped neck pillow			0
unfortunately , the support i needed just was n't there			0
in addition , they are often too bulky to fit in my backpack			0
it 's small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag and works by allowing the muscles in your neck to relax supportive : the neck pillow is easily put on and is small enough to fit into a laptop case or handbag strapping : the strap is adjustable and sits below the armpit whether your on your daily commute or cradling a sleeping a baby , this could be your saviour ' and if you are like me , you feel claustrophobic when things are wrapped around your neck			0
' and who wants to inflate a device every time you need to use it ? ' during a flight about four years ago , i awoke with neck discomfort again and started drawing out the idea that would eventually become the @entity92			0
' out with the old : foam pillows available widely but , according to the doctor , that do n't give adequate support dr @entity10 added : ' as a physician ... i strive to have an impact on people 's lives every day			1
i truly believe with the @entity20 i can help more people than ever before			2
' with your support we can fund the initial manufacturing runs and turn the neck pillow business on its ear			2
' one of the support 's first customers , @entity111 , commented on @entity112 , ' i love @entity113 ! @entity10 did a great job			2
