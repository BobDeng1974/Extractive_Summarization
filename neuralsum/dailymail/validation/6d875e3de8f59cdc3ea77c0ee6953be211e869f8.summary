a family was devastated after they went to visit the grave of their late mother and grandmother only to find a large pile of rubble had been dumped on top of it			1
@entity10 had taken her two children and three grandchildren to visit her mother @entity13 's grave in @entity15 in @entity16 on @entity17 but found flowers and an ornament on the grave had been pushed aside to make way for a large pile of soil			1
ms @entity10 54 , said : ' it 's just heartbreaking			2
we did n't even have anywhere to put the flowers			0
' to cover up someone 's grave with a pile of rubble is so disrespectful - i could n't believe it , ' added ms @entity10			1
' we wanted to say our prayers on @entity17 but we could n't			0
my grandchildren had written a prayer			0
' how do you explain that their great - grandma 's grave is n't there because it 's just a pile of rubble ? i could n't get to sleep the next night because i was just so devastated			1
' the grandmother - of - five had taken her family to visit the grave of her mother , who died last year at the age of 89			1
since her death the family have been saving up for a headstone but had placed a memorial plaque , vases and a @entity64 ornament , which had been blessed by the @entity65 in @entity66 , on the grave			2
ms @entity10 said it was ' heartbreaking ' to find her mother 's grave covered in the large mound of soil @entity73 ( pictured left , aged 28 ) died about a year ago and was buried in @entity75 cemetery ( pictured right about six weeks before her death last year ) last wednesday ms @entity77 visited the site and left flowers and angel ornament			1
but when she returned just days later she found soil and large rocks had been dumped on her mother 's grave , as another plot had been dug about six inches away			1
the family also believe the new plot encroaches on their land , because they bought three at the time so other family members could eventually be buried alongside @entity13			2
ms @entity10 , a jewellery dealer , added : ' we ca n't afford a marble memorial but it 's irrelevant because it 's still my mum 's grave			1
' i go to see it regularly and it was okay on wednesday			0
@entity100 said the rubble had been placed on top of the grave while they dug a new plot ms @entity77 ' family almost did n't realise the pile of rubble was at the site of their relative 's grave ms @entity10 said flowers and ornaments , including of @entity64 ( blue ) had been pushed aside ' everything i had left there was chucked to the side like it did n't matter			1
' she loved the @entity64 ornament and it cost hundreds of pounds			0
the plot belongs to us and they have no right to do that			0
' ms @entity77 's son @entity123 said they almost walked past the grave at first , not realising it was under a heap of discarded rubble			2
he said : ' it ca n't have been an accident because they 've had to actually move all the stuff , and it 's not like there was nowhere else to put the muck			0
' either way , there should n't be a grave being dug so close			0
it 's blood - curdling to think they could have disturbed my grandmother 's grave			1
' @entity100 , which runs the cemetery , has apologised to the family			2
ms @entity10 said her family had been saving up for a headstone and were devastated by the grave the plot was covered in flowers before the rubble had been dumped upon it in time for @entity17 @entity151 , portfolio holder for the environment , said : ' we are really sorry for any distress experienced by the @entity156 family			1
' @entity15 is a working cemetery , which means that graves are being dug out and prepared for new burials all the time			0
' in this case , a grave was being prepared adjacent to the grave of the @entity156 family and , as a result , earth was placed on the adjacent grave , pending the new burial			0
' given the close proximity between graves , this practice is often unavoidable but we always remove any earth that is left on adjacent graves as quickly as possible			0
' he said that any family items removed as part of a new grave being dug are returned to where they came from .			0

@entity10 took her family to visit her mother 's grave in @entity16
she had been there the week before to lay flowers on her late mother 's plot
but when they arrived the grave had been covered in a large pile of rubble
there was no space to lay flowers and ornament had been cast aside
@entity100 said it was *normal* when digging new plots
apologised for distress and said was usually done as quickly as possible
