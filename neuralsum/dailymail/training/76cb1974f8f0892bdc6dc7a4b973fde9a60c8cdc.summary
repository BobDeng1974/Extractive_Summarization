by @entity1 reporter published : 19:54 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 03:25 est , 18 march 2013 a painting hanging in the former home of sir @entity4 has been confirmed as a self - portrait by the @entity7 master @entity6			1
for decades the picture , which has been at @entity9 in @entity10 since it was given to the @entity11 in 2010 , was thought to have been a portrait produced by one of @entity6 ’s pupils			1
but years of studying the 17th - century artist ’s style and a new investigation of the painting by the world ’s leading @entity6 expert , @entity19 , has re-attributed the painting as a work by the @entity23 himself			1
handle with care : curator at @entity9 @entity27 inspects a confirmed self - portrait of @entity6 estimated to be worth £ 20 million the painting , kept in storage for the first 18 months it was at @entity9 as there was nowhere to hang it , is now one of the @entity11 ’s most important			1
it has been given a value of £ 20 million , although as the trust holds items on behalf of the nation forever , the organisation said it can never be sold			0
the painting was given to the @entity11 as a gift from the estate of the late @entity44 , @entity45 of @entity46 , whose husband @entity47 , lord @entity47 , collected a great number of paintings during his lifetime			0
the self - portrait showing @entity6 aged 29 , “ signed ” by the @entity7 master and dated 1635 , previously belonged to the @entity53 of @entity54			1
its provenance had been shrouded in mystery for 40 years , after @entity6 specialist @entity58 suggested in 1968 that it may well have been painted by one of @entity6 ’s pupils			1
the real deal : property manager @entity62 , left , and @entity63 at @entity9 @entity27 gingerly carry the precious picture in the same year members of the @entity66 inspected the painting and came to the same conclusion , publishing their findings in 1989			0
mr @entity19 , @entity7 art historian and chairman of the @entity66 , said that based on what was known of the painter ’s style in 1968 , experts decided it was most likely to have been painted by one of his pupils			0
“ but over the past 45 years we have gathered far more knowledge about @entity6 ’s self - portraits and the fluctuations in his style , ” he said			2
an analysis by mr @entity19 , based on an x-ray of the painting published in 2005 and newly found circumstantial evidence , increased the likelihood it was by @entity6 himself			1
mr @entity19 went to @entity9 to look again at the painting , and said he saw the same crude brushwork and painting technique observed in other @entity6 pictures of that period , leading to the conclusion it was by the @entity7 master			2
gently does it : staff hang the self - portrait in pride of place at @entity9 , near @entity102 @entity62 , @entity11 property manager at @entity9 , said : “ it ’s amazing to think we might ’ve had an actual @entity6 hanging here on the walls at @entity9 for the past couple of years			1
we never dared think it might actually be an original , and many of our visitors will have just passed by it in what is sure to be a real contrast to the attention it is now going to receive			0
” @entity27 , curator of paintings and sculpture at the @entity11 , said : “ @entity6 was one of the great artists of the so - called @entity7 golden age			2
former owner : adventurer sir @entity4 lived at @entity9 for 15 years from 1581 he produced a huge number of self - portraits throughout his career , partly because he had a ready subject matter in himself , through which he could develop his painting technique but also because , as he was already famous , the finished images were highly desirable pictures for collectors			1
“ this portrait is now one of our most important works of art and will be the only @entity6 in the @entity11 ’s collection of approximately 13,500 paintings			1
” the painting will hang in @entity9 for another eight months before being sent for cleaning and further examination to shed more light on its attribution			2
a full technical analysis , funded by £ 20,000 from the @entity143 , will include x-rays , examination of paint pigments , infrared testing to examine any drawing under the painting and tree - ring dating of the beech panel it is painted on			0
@entity153 was originally a @entity154 abbey founded in 1278 by @entity155 , countess of @entity10 and was a daughter house of @entity157 , on the @entity158			2
it remained an abbey until the @entity161 by @entity162 in 1541 @entity162 sold @entity153 to sir @entity163 who , working with his son @entity164 , began to convert the abbey into a residence			0
@entity164 died in 1545 , leaving a son , also named @entity163 , who completed the conversion			0
he eventually sold @entity153 to @entity4 in 1581			0
@entity4 lived in the house for 15 years , as did many of his descendants until 1946 , when it was sold to a local landowner , @entity173 , who presented the property to the @entity11 in 1948			0
the abbey has been open to the public since 1951 .			0

the rare picture was found at sir @entity4 *'s* home in @entity10
it was *initially* thought to be a portrait of @entity6 by one of his pupils
portrait stayed in storage for the 18 months as there was nowhere to hang it
