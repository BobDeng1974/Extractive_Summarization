@entity0 has predicted @entity1 will benefit from @entity3 ’s spectacular rise — as it will spur @entity4 on to cement himself as @entity6 ’s no 1 striker			1
the biggest game in the @entity8 this week takes place at @entity10 tonight , with man - of - the - moment @entity3 and @entity12 ’s rapidly improving side looking to derail @entity1 ’s hopes of clambering back into the top four			1
@entity0 , a keen admirer of @entity3 , believes it is a question of when , rather than if , he gets a senior @entity6 call - up but he has given the 21 - year - old an idea of how much further he has to climb by labelling @entity4 the best @entity19 forward in the business			1
@entity4 ( centre ) scored against @entity22 on his return from a long injury lay - off @entity3 scored both of @entity12 's goals as they came from behind to beat @entity27 2 - 1 on saturday @entity0 says the competition posed by @entity3 to @entity4 's @entity6 place will improve the @entity1 man after @entity4 ’s three appearances off the bench in a week , @entity0 is considering whether his striker is fit enough to start			1
the 25 - year - old has had to watch as a number of players have staked their claim for inclusion in @entity40 ’s squad for next month ’s games against @entity42 and @entity43			0
however , @entity1 boss @entity0 does not feel any of those players have shown they are ready to match the standards @entity4 ( right ) has set in his career at @entity10			1
‘ i ’m sure @entity4 is happy there ’s another @entity19 striker there , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if @entity3 ’s going to be of the level to go on and play for @entity6 — which i believe he is — that helps @entity4 and the other @entity1 players who play for @entity6 because it means you get another top - quality striker			1
but , for me , there is not anyone better than @entity4			2
‘ he ’s got everything in his game if he ’s playing consistently			0
his goalscoring record , his pace , his power — he ’s got everything and as an @entity19 striker there ’s no - one better than him			0
‘ i ’m sure @entity4 will look at it that there ’s another young @entity19 striker coming through and that will really help him when they come together at international level			2
when @entity4 is on the field he gives the opponents ’ defence a real problem but also he ’s a natural goalscorer			2
’ @entity1 have carefully managed @entity4 ’s rehabilitation and while the stakes against @entity12 are high , he will only start if @entity0 is satisfied he can stand the strain			1
‘ he has got a big , big talent , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ he ’s going to have to try and work his way back to fitness in games as there ’s so little time in between games to train			0
’ @entity3 ( centre ) heads @entity12 's winner four minutes from full - time against rivals @entity27 on saturday midfielder @entity87 ( right ) could be out for around a month after injuring his thigh against @entity89 @entity1 owner @entity90 ( right ) will be in attendance at @entity10 for @entity1 's game with @entity12 @entity0 ’s preparations for the clash with @entity12 have been hindered by a thigh injury to key midfielder @entity87 , which will keep him out for at least a month			1
it is a blow for the manager as @entity1 have been unbeaten in the last 11 @entity8 games he has started			1
that run has helped them get into contention for a @entity105 place but , equally , their poor start to the campaign means they have given themselves no margin for error			0
@entity0 insists he is under no pressure from @entity113 , the club ’s owners			2
‘ we had a good chat after training , ’ said @entity0 , referring to a visit to @entity117 from @entity90 and @entity118			0
‘ they are on a flying visit for the game			0
i ’ve never been set any targets but they know the type of manager they employed was a manager who wants to succeed			0
‘ for us , ( the top four ) is where we want to be and , after not such a good start to the season , we are picking up			0
we want to continue with the momentum and that ’s all we can focus on			0

@entity3 has 22 goals for @entity12 and is tipped to play for @entity6
but @entity1 boss @entity0 think @entity4 is better
the two will go head - to - head in the @entity8 on *tuesday* night
