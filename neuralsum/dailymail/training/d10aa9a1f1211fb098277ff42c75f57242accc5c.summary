by @entity0 an enormous region of @entity2 is far more vulnerable to thaw that previously thought , according to a new study			1
researchers claim that global warming could trigger an unstoppable slide of ice into the ocean and raise world sea levels for thousands of years			1
the @entity11 in @entity2 , stretching more than 600 miles ( 1,000 km ) inland , has enough ice to raise world sea levels by 10 to 13 feet ( three to four metres )			1
a study has said ' unstable ice plugs ' are all that is holding back a giant sheet of ice known as the @entity11 in @entity2			1
if they were to melt , the ice sheet could raise sea levels by up to four metres ( 13 feet ) over the next few thousand years			1
pictured is a large pack of floating ice known as an ice floe near @entity2 the @entity26 is vulnerable because it is held in place by a small rim of ice , resting on bedrock below sea level by the coast of the frozen continent			1
that ' ice plug ' might melt away in coming centuries if ocean waters warm up			2
' @entity2 's @entity11 is like a bottle on a slant			1
once uncorked , it empties out , ' @entity40 of the @entity41 , lead author of the study in the journal @entity45 , said in a statement			2
co-author @entity48 , also at @entity49 in @entity50 , said the main finding was that the ice flow would be irreversible , if set in motion			2
but he said there was still time to limit warming to levels to keep the ice plug in place			2
almost 200 governments have promised to work out a @entity61 deal by the end of 2015 to curb increasing emissions of man - made greenhouse gases to prevent more droughts , heatwaves , downpours and rising sea levels			1
worries about rising seas that could swamp low - lying areas from @entity73 to @entity74 focus most on ice in @entity76 and @entity77 , as well as far smaller amounts of ice in mountain ranges from the @entity81 to the @entity82			2
@entity83 : the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) expects ' multiple stresses and systemic failures due to climate change ' in the @entity88			0
this will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050			0
@entity92 : flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of @entity98			0
southern areas are expected to experience a shortage of water			0
@entity102 : the majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern @entity102			0
however , water is also expected to affect most of @entity102			0
@entity107 : there remains uncertainty about impact in @entity107 , but extreme weather is predicted			0
the @entity112 will continue to degrade , with warmer water bleaching more coral			0
@entity115 : food security will be a major issue for @entity115			0
crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought			0
there will also be more soil erosion from storms			0
@entity125 and @entity126 : scientists expect @entity128 may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100 , while the area around @entity131 could get a 25 per cent increase			0
this image , taken by @entity136 's @entity135 space probe as it flew by @entity137 on its way to @entity139 in 1996 , shows the @entity11 ( bottom right ) as part of the @entity142			2
the basin stretches back more than 600 miles ( 1,000 km ) inland and could dramatically raise sea levels if ' ice plugs ' holding it back were to melt , says a study this study is among the first to gauge risks in @entity2 , the biggest wedge of the continent and usually considered stable			1
' i would not be surprised if this ( basin ) is more vulnerable than @entity77 , ' @entity48 said			0
@entity2 , the size of the @entity155 and @entity156 combined , holds enough ice to raise sea levels by some 188 feet ( 57 metres ) if it ever all melted			1
the study indicated that it could take 200 years or more to melt the ice plugs if ocean temperatures rise			1
once removed , it could take between 5,000 and 10,000 years for ice in the @entity11 to empty as gravity pulled the ice seawards			1
' it sounds plausible , ' @entity166 , a professor of glaciology at @entity168 who was not involved in the study , said of the findings			0
the region is not an immediate threat , he said , but ' could contribute metres to sea level rise over thousands of years			2
' the @entity61 panel on climate change says it is at least 95 percent probable that human activities such as burning fossil fuels , rather than natural swings in the climate , are the dominant cause of warming since the 1950s			0
sea levels are likely to rise by between 0.85 to 2.7 feet ( 26 and 82 centimetres ) by the late 21st century , after a rise of ( 0.62 feet ) 19 cm since 1900 , it says			2
@entity2 , however , remains the biggest uncertainty in the calculations as to how much sea levels will rise			1
the @entity11 in @entity2 , stretching more than 600 miles ( 1,000 km ) inland , has enough ice to raise world sea levels by 10 to 13 feet ( three to four metres ) if its ice plugs are allowed to melt if the ice plugs are not sustained , the increase in sea - level rise could become catastrophic			1

@entity2 is more at risk than thought to long - term thaw , says study
the researchers say @entity11 could raise seas for thousands of years
they claim the ice sheet is only being held back by ' unstable ice plugs '
and if these disappear it would trigger a *massive* slide of sea ice
this could raise sea levels by up to 4 metres - but only after *25,000* years
