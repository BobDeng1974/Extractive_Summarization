by @entity0 for the @entity1 a @entity3 euthanasia doctor killed a woman in her 80s because she did not want to live in a nursing home			1
the death has prompted regulators to refer the case to prosecutors for the first time since euthanasia was legalised in the @entity3 12 years ago			2
the unidentified woman died by lethal injection in the @entity15 – or @entity16 – after she complained she did not want to spend the rest of her life in a care home			1
the doctor administered a lethal injection to the woman in 80s who had complained she did not want to spend the rest of her life in a care home after she was partially paralysed by a stroke ( picture posed by models ) a doctor concluded the unhappiness of the woman , who had been partially paralysed by a stroke , constituted ‘ unbearable suffering ’ – the legal requirement for euthanasia			1
but the regional review committee , which polices euthanasia , found the doctor was negligent and referred the case to the @entity39 , which will decide whether a crime has been committed			1
it comes months after professor @entity42 , a member of a review committee , warned @entity45 politicians not to legalise assisted suicide because the @entity3 experiment had been a disaster			1
the @entity16 was established in the @entity49 in 2012 to provide euthanasia to patients whose family doctors object to it			1
it has helped about 250 patients to die in the past two years and also has mobile doctors to administer lethal drugs in people ’s homes			1
according to the @entity3 newspaper @entity61 , regulators acted after the doctor who killed the woman based the decision to end her life ‘ solely on the fact that the patient was in a nursing home ’			2
the @entity16 was established in the @entity49 in 2012 to provide euthanasia to patients twenty years earlier the woman had put in writing her desire not to live in a such a home if she became incapacitated			1
she expressed this wish verbally to her doctor 18 months ago and soon afterwards was left unable to communicate properly by a stroke			0
a family member contacted the euthanasia clinic when he formed the impression that the woman had begun to complain			0
an independent doctor who visited her reported that she said only two words – ‘ kan niet [ can not ] ’ – and that she held her head in her hands			0
according to a report by the regulators , this was regarded by the doctor as sufficient evidence of ‘ despair and unhappiness ’ to constitute unbearable suffering			2
but nursing home staff reported that the elderly woman was very often content , friendly and quiet			0
the case represents the second time in four months that regulators have criticised the clinic			0
in april officials said a doctor had not conducted sufficient interviews with a woman with psychiatric problems before helping her to die			2
a week before peers debated proposals by @entity107 to legalise assisted suicide in the @entity45 , professor @entity42 – who has reviewed around 4,000 lethal injection deaths – warned : ‘ do n’t go there			1
’ once an advocate of euthanasia , he said he now thought the @entity3 were ‘ terribly wrong ’ to think they could control it			0
the professor said his country had seen an ‘ explosive increase ’ in euthanasia deaths since 2007 and he expected the number to hit a record 6,000 this year			0
he was also gravely concerned at the extension of killing to new groups , including the depressed			0
@entity125 in @entity126 said the @entity127 , due to reach the committee stage in the @entity129 in november , is based on a model that ‘ has never been extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness ’			0
but paralympian @entity133 said the killing of the care home resident showed safeguards ‘ do not work ’			0
@entity137 of @entity138 , who investigated euthanasia for a parliamentary inquiry , said : ‘ the @entity3 experiment shows that [ the law ] will be abused , that policing such abuse is extremely difficult and , of course , it is always too late			2
