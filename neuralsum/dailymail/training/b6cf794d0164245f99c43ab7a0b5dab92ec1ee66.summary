by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 ' i watch him a lot and try to do the same things that he does , ' @entity2 told @entity6 of his infatuation with former @entity9 star @entity8			1
and judging by their stats from their debut seasons at @entity15 , the youngster 's statement may just be more factual than first thought			0
for the duo scored an identical number of goals in their first full campaign at the club , as well as sharing almost identical records in other fields			2
identical : the similarities are there , but will @entity2 ( left ) live up to his potential like @entity8 ( right ) did ? world class : @entity8 grew to be a @entity9 and eventually a world great the statistics provided by @entity30 are from @entity8 's 2003/04 season , and @entity2 's breakthrough campaign under @entity33			1
like @entity8 , @entity2 has arrived as a youngster from foreign shores , eager to kick on and hold down a first team spot			2
but he has some act to follow			0
upon signing @entity8 from @entity39 in 2003 for over £ 12million , sir @entity38 knew straight away a legend was born at @entity15			0
in his autobiography , @entity38 described first seeing @entity8 as ‘ the biggest surge of excitement and anticipation i experienced in football management ’			0
goes down easy : @entity2 has been criticised for play acting on several occasions this season silverware : @entity8 celebrates scoring the opener against @entity49 in the 2004 @entity51 final stepovers and tricks followed on a @entity55 bow against @entity56 , with fans already in awe of their new @entity60 son			1
it was @entity38 who brought @entity2 to @entity62 in 2011 from @entity63 , but he never featured under the empowering @entity64 , only first impressing under countryman @entity33			2
his full debut at @entity9 - away at @entity66 in november - produced two goals and a man of the match award			0
a fine start , but their would be few supporters who would think the now fully - pledged @entity72 can match the almighty career of @entity8			0
the 18 - year - old has hardly featured in recent months , and perhaps similarly to @entity8 , been criticised for falling to the ground too easily			1
like for like : @entity8 's first season is almost identical to @entity2 's first campaign at @entity15 fan favourite : the @entity15 crowd recognised @entity8 's quality and potential straight away much to prove : @entity2 still has some fans to win over , and the new manager , too the difference is , however , that @entity2 has picked up a staggering six yellow cards this season , all for simulation			1
@entity8 has described himself in the past of being ' sent by god ' to play football , but is somewhat ordinary statistics from his first season show that pressure should not be put on @entity2 so early in his career			1
if @entity96 is to come in , a manager famed for overseeing progression of youth , the teenager could go on to forge a successful career in @entity101			0
but after his first year , @entity8 then went on to score 80 times in his next 167 league appearances for @entity9 , as well as a staggering 177 in 165 @entity105 games for @entity106			1
that is the challenge @entity2 faces			0
on top of the world : @entity8 won the @entity110 this year after @entity112 's dominance mega man : @entity8 left after six years of service , and @entity2 will no doubt be hot property as well			2

@entity8 scored the same number of goals as @entity2 has in his first season
other statistics are almost identical between the two players
@entity8 went on to be a @entity9 great , moving to @entity106 in 2009
@entity2 has hardly featured for @entity9 in recent months
