by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 10:21 est , 3 january 2014 when @entity3 appeared on @entity5 's dating show @entity4 in 2013 she hoped to find love and live happily ever after			1
now the 24 - year - old 's dream has come true after she got engaged on @entity8 - but not to the man she met on tv			2
however the matchmaking show presented by @entity13 can take some credit for the engagement as @entity3 's fiance , @entity16 , 24 , got in touch after seeing her on the box			1
big screen proposal : @entity16 popped the question to @entity3 via a digital billboard on @entity24 's @entity23 @entity3 , from @entity25 , and @entity26 - born @entity16 had been student sweethearts but lost touch after they graduated from university			1
but seeing @entity3 appear on tv prompted @entity16 to seek her out again			1
as well as their shared history , they had something else in common since graduating - @entity16 had also failed to find love on television			2
he had appeared on @entity36 's dating show @entity37 , hosted by former @entity39 dj @entity38 and x factor finalist @entity40 , which was also aired last year			1
when she was looking for love : @entity44 appeared on @entity4 in 2013 and is seen here sharing a joke with host @entity13 no likey , no lighty : @entity44 won a date on the show but the romance did n't last after seeing @entity3 had also been on tv , @entity16 sought her out and asked her if she wanted to meet up as ' fellow failed dating show contestants			1
' @entity3 had been picked to go on a date on her fifth appearance on @entity4 - the popular saturday night show with the catchphrase ' no likey , no lighty ' ( as the female contestants turn off their lights if they do n't like the male contestant who appears )			1
but while she got on well with @entity63 from @entity64 who she met on the show , their romance did not last			0
@entity16 then contacted her out of the blue asking her out			0
@entity16 explains : ' we met six years ago in @entity26 and we dated for a while			0
but we were young and went our separate ways when she finished uni and went back to @entity25			2
reunited : @entity16 , who had been on @entity36 dating show @entity37 , contacted @entity44 - a former university flame - after seeing her on @entity4 ' we had n't spoken to each other for about four or five years , but when i saw her on @entity74 her and suggested we meet up as fellow failed dating show contestants			1
' the pair met for a drink on @entity79 , 2013 , and have been together ever since			0
@entity16 said : ' it 's just one of those things			0
when we met up again we did n't have to go through dating as we knew each other so well from before			0
' then @entity16 delighted @entity3 , who is currently seven months pregnant with his son , on @entity8 - which is also her birthday - by popping the question			1
thanks to their tv appearances , he gave her a fitting proposal involving a big screen at @entity24 's @entity23			0
fitting : as they had both been on television , @entity16 thought a big screen was appropriate for his proposal @entity16 said : ' with us both having been on tv i wanted to do something to make a show out of the proposal , and i knew she 'd love it			1
we were in @entity25 for @entity8 so i asked all her old friends and her family to be there for it			2
' the couple , who live in @entity26 , hope to get married next year			0
@entity3 said : ' i did n't have a clue that @entity16 was about to propose			2
i just thought we were going out because it was my birthday as well			0
' then i came out onto the prom and saw the photograph on the screen and wondered what was going on			0
it was such a thoughtful and lovely thing to do			0
