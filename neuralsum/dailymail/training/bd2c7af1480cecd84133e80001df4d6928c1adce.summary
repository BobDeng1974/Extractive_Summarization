she has turned down the chance to pose for @entity2 , holds more titles than @entity4 , and may have even inspired the duchess of @entity7 's wedding dress			1
but despite her high profile in her native @entity9 , little is known about the @entity5 on these shores , with the focus more often falling on her wild hair , flamboyant fashion sense and toyboy husband			1
now the 87 - year - old billionaire has shed a little more light on her event - filled life with the publication of her second autobiography - just two years after her first			1
entitled life : the @entity5 , pictured on her wedding day in 1947 , left , and in 2011 , right , has opened up about her unique life in a new autobiography first marriage : the duchess of @entity27 on her wedding day with her father @entity28 , the 17th @entity5 , and mother @entity29 in what life has taught me is the follow up to @entity33 , and the @entity5 writes that despite her wealth all she wants is her health , and that she is eager to ' keep on living '			1
@entity26 , or @entity39 @entity38 - @entity37 , to give her the full name , is @entity9 's richest woman , has more recognised titles than any other noble in the world and is a distant relative of both @entity44 and princess @entity45			1
as the head of the @entity48 , and the 18th @entity5 , her property portfolio includes castles , palaces , country houses and land across @entity9 - with the most famous being the @entity53 in @entity54 , where she was born			1
as well as the eccentric @entity5 , the palace is also thought to be home to 249 oil paintings by artists including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , as well as the @entity64 which dates back to 1430			0
wedding number one : the @entity5 is pictured with her new husband on their wedding day in october 1947 wedded bliss : @entity71 @entity70 , 18th @entity72 on her 2011 wedding day to third husband @entity74 , who is 24 years her junior getting down : the @entity5 dances with her son @entity75 at the wedding reception for her third marriage to @entity78 in october 2011 @entity26 is a descendant of @entity79 of @entity80 , through his illegitimate son @entity81 , @entity81 whose mother was @entity83 , the sister of the @entity84			2
she is therefore distantly related to sir @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity45 , who were descendants of @entity83 ‘ s daughter @entity86			0
her godmother was @entity88 of @entity9 and although her supreme title is @entity5 , she has more than 44 other noble titles , and 150 hereditary ones			1
she is a duchess seven times over , a countess 19 times and a marquesa 23 times			2
despite her privileged past , in her latest tome the @entity5 said that her life ' had not been easy '			2
early bliss : the 18th duchess of @entity27 with her husband @entity99 in january 1961 family portrait : the couple with their sons , left to right , @entity103 - @entity37 , 23rd count of @entity105 , @entity106 , 11th @entity107 , @entity108 , 15th @entity109 , and @entity110 , 14th @entity111 she has lived through both @entity113 , and the @entity114 , which broke out 1936 , when she was just 10 - years - old to 1939			1
however , the @entity5 has said that her ' most difficult task ' was the reconstruction of the family palace in @entity54 after it was almost completely razed to the ground during the @entity114			0
today the @entity5 is often written about for her appearance , and her apparent surgical enhancements , although she has never commented on this			0
in her youth however the @entity5 was a striking beauty , and was even asked by the world - famous painter @entity2 to become his muse - although she flatly refused this request			2
' i think he would have worn me out , ' she said in 2009 , according to @entity9 's @entity131 news website @entity132			1
' i never actually met @entity2			0
the message came to me via the bullfighter @entity134			0
' @entity136 : the @entity5 with her eldest children pictured in @entity54 three years earlier , in 1959 loving mother : the @entity5 is caught on camera with and her baby son @entity140 in january 1961 @entity141 : the art loving @entity5 , pictured in 1961 , was once asked to pose for @entity2 , but turned him down @entity26 has said that she never regretted her decision , adding that she found being a model very dull and ' horrible '			0
@entity26 has been known for her colourful love life , which has taken in three marriages , including her latest to civil servant @entity147 , 24 years her junior , who she wed in october 2011 when she was 85			1
the marriage was partly made possible after a valve was inserted into the @entity151 's brain to stop the cognitive decline she had begun to suffer			2
the @entity5 's first marriage , to naval officer @entity154 , son of the @entity155 , was a far more lavish affair and even said to have overshadowed interest in the wedding of @entity4 to prince @entity159 , which took place a month later			2
@entity9 roses : @entity26 and @entity163 admire a rose garden in @entity165 in 1966 when she played host to mrs @entity163 in the saddle : @entity26 on horseback with @entity163 , sporting traditional @entity169 riding outfits , during the @entity163 's visit to @entity165 , @entity9 in 1966 , watching a bullfight : @entity163 ( centre ) and the @entity5 ( right ) are seen wearing traditional @entity9 veils alongside the countess of @entity175 ( left ) the @entity176 called it ' the most expensive wedding of the world ' , and the couple , who wed when the @entity5 was 21 - years - old went on to have six children together before his death in 1972			1
on her wedding day october 12 , 1947 , the @entity151 walked down the aisle in an opulent dress which , which its lace sleeves , full skirt and train bore a striking resemblance to the @entity192 design worn by the @entity193 in 2011			0
in 1978 the @entity5 caused a scandal in @entity9 by marrying an illegitimate defrocked @entity196 priest , her former confessor , @entity195 , who died in 2001			2
' i confess i am thinking of keeping on living , ' said the @entity5 recently , ' although it 's only so i can enjoy the expression on people ’s faces when i point at them and say " i ’m going to bury you all "			0
' colourful life : @entity26 sported a fiery hairdo , matching that of actress @entity207 , during a horse fair in @entity165 in 2001 third time 's a charm : her third wedding , to @entity78 , took place at the chapel of the @entity214 in @entity165 in 2011 @entity215 : @entity216 , @entity217 joined the @entity5 at a flamenco performance during the royals ' three day visit to @entity9 in april 2011 royal visit : the @entity5 speaks to @entity222 and @entity216 at a charity gala dinner in @entity224 , in 2011 @entity26 met third husband @entity147 30 years ago , through her second husband , although they only started dating after a chance meeting in a cinema			1
he has reportedly signed a document renouncing any claim to the @entity48 wealth and the noble title will pass on to the @entity5 ’s eldest son , @entity234 , when she dies			0
she overcame opposition to the match by dividing up her wealth - thought to be between £ 524m and £ 3bn - between her six children and eight grandchildren to allay their fears over inheritance issues			0
last month , while she was enjoying a romantic holiday with her latest husband in @entity244 , the @entity151 broke her femur in a fall and had to undergo surgery			0
the couple had chosen the @entity249 capital as it was where they had spent their first holiday together , although they were only friends at that time .			0
