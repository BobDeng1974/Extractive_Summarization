after 21 months and 82 appearances since he signed from @entity14 in july 2013 , @entity11 opened his account with a 30 - yard effort which could barely have been struck sweeter			1
the score was already 1 - 1 when , in the 29th minute , @entity2 defender @entity18 stretched to clear on the edge of the box and the ball bounced to @entity7 , who hit it first time then watched it fly in off the right post			1

‘ it was so emphatic it got the crowd up and us up			0
we needed it , when they scored they had a good period and it changed the dynamic			0
’ it was a torrid night for @entity18 who was all too easily shrugged away from the ball when @entity6 striker @entity29 ran on to a long pass from @entity32 , took a touch and then finished low under goalkeeper @entity56 to open the scoring after eight minutes			1
but five minutes later @entity2 levelled			0
@entity60 wonderfully arced a cross from the left which was headed in by @entity67			0

’ @entity6 restored their lead with @entity7 ’s strike but @entity107 , formerly of @entity108 , missed a simple chance to level for @entity2 when he shot wide from three yards			1
@entity56 tipped @entity33 ’s powerful header over on 49 minutes and denied @entity39 in the 76th before @entity32 sent the rebound on to the bar			2
in stoppage time , however , @entity6 finally added a third			0
@entity7 had a chance to shoot from distance and the @entity80 crowd were urging him on , but the midfielder passed to @entity33 instead and the striker slotted in			2
