the @entity7 artist spends his days carving skulls and skeletons out of thick software manuals			0
it took around 200 hours for mr @entity5 to sculpt this detailed skull from seven of the nerdy tomes using an angle grinder and router - a tool used in woodwork			1
mr @entity5 , 34 , from @entity30 , @entity7 , said : ' i am not interested in simply reproducing the trick of carving into books - this could become meaningless			1
' instead , each of my works needs to match a substance with a subject in a way that reveals them both in a completely new way			0
scale and polish ? mr @entity5 said he chose software manuals because they had had a conceptual link to the skull ' i approach my work as a test or experiment			1
i investigate the mechanical , aesthetic and conceptual potentials of both the technique and material			0
' for the skull carving , i chose software manuals because they were the right size and had a bright - white page colour			2
' but they also had a conceptual link to the skull			2
the information in them had been rendered futile after carving the brainless , and equally useless , skull into them			0
' need to improve your posture ? the artist has also carved a human rib cage into a stack of newspapers intricate detail : some of mr @entity5 's work has been exhibited at his own gallery while other pieces have gone on show in the @entity76 in @entity77 hard work : mr @entity5 said paper was a very difficult medium to carve because of its grain and the fact the pages are not connected to each other laterally he added : ' paper is a very difficult medium to carve because of its grain and the fact the pages are not connected to each other laterally			1
' mr @entity5 also designed and created his own steel press which held the seven manuals tightly together			2
some of his work has been exhibited at his own gallery while other pieces went on show this summer at the @entity95 in @entity77			1
ever feel like your head 's in a vice ? mr @entity5 also designed and created his own steel press which held the seven manuals tightly together working from life : mr @entity5 grinds his creations by eye using a real human skull for reference he added : ' what i enjoy about my works is the process of creating them			1
the concentration needed means i tend to work in short bursts , maybe 20 to 60 minutes at a time , to achieve the best results			0
' as finished objects , i can only hope that something of the care and attention that i invested in them is accessible to the viewer			0
' i also hope that my works inspire my audiences and while also engaging in their interest and curiosity			0
