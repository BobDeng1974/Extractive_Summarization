@entity1 's 17 - man squad to defend the ashes against @entity3 this summer is packed with pace men as well as a fair share of ageing stars			1
ten of their squad are in their thirties , paving the way for a raft of @entity14 references that will gather momentum if they get off to a bad start in @entity18			1
nonetheless , this is a squad that i would pick to defend the urn			1
never mind planning for the future , their tour will be all about the present			2
@entity26 celebrate after winning the @entity27 before naming their @entity2 squad @entity29 my first thought when i saw the squad was that it ’s the way i ’d have gone about selection			2
a five - test series in @entity3 is not the time to experiment and the @entity35 have put faith in experience			1
@entity1 's selection of @entity39 will bring an experienced head with them this summer @entity39 is an interesting choice : like @entity43 , he knows @entity45 conditions well			1
it ’s not a tour for blooding a young batsman			2
it ’s also why they ’ve gone with @entity51 among the seamers			2
if @entity53 breaks down , @entity51 can slot straight in			2
firepower if @entity55 bowls anything like he did during the last @entity2 , @entity1 should win			1
both sides know there ’s still some scarring			2
@entity60 managed to swing the white @entity61 during the @entity27 so he should be able to swing the red @entity63 ball in @entity3			1
he swings it late , too — as @entity65 found out in the final			2
fast bowler @entity55 will be hoping to terrorise @entity45 batsmen like he did last time around i was impressed with @entity69 , too			2
he could prosper in @entity3 with his hit - the - deck style			1
@entity53 always has wicket - taking potential , although i wonder how quickly he ’ll slot back in after sitting out the @entity75 tour			2
no 3 @entity76 the series could hinge on @entity1 ’s @entity78			1
whoever it is , @entity3 will think they have a chance			1
@entity82 has done the job in the past without ever really making it his own and there ’s been talk of @entity88 moving up the order			2
@entity88 has been in sensational form and could get moved up the batting order to @entity78 he ’s in the form of his life but he still moves around a lot at the crease			2
if the ball ’s swinging , that could spell trouble			2
the other option would be @entity39 , who has just averaged 104 in the @entity101			0
@entity102 i firmly believe you should try to get every last drop out of some of these cricketers , especially in an @entity2			0
as @entity3 discovered in 2013 - 14 , an ageing side is only a problem if the players are approaching retirement , like @entity112			1
at 37 - years - old , @entity113 is likely to be playing his last @entity2 along with a few others but for someone like @entity43 this tour will be a last hurrah			1
i ’ll be watching @entity113			1
he ’s a fierce competitor but he ’s 37 and keeping in @entity3 can be tricky because of the late swing			1
@entity118 at the back part of the reason @entity122 has given up one - day internationals is to manage his dodgy back			1
@entity125 will tell you a bad back can go at any moment , although @entity122 looked physically sharp during the @entity27			1
captain @entity122 will be hoping he does n't suffer a recurrence of his back problems but if the @entity1 captain ’s back is stiff when they play in @entity3 , the bowlers will test out the 33 - year - old ’s suppleness against the short ball			1
he ’s still vulnerable early on			0
@entity122 ( capt ) age 33 caps 108 verdict age has not diminished his class , as he proved in the @entity27 final			1
but his dodgy back could be an issue in a five - test series			0
should out - captain @entity146 once more			0
@entity147 age 28 caps 36 verdict could win a test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions			0
@entity155 ’s off - breaks will be crucial in pinning him down			0
likes to say a word or two			0
@entity82 age 33 caps 56 verdict has a decent record in @entity2 cricket , but has never reached the stage where he frightens @entity3			1
but his medium - pace balances @entity1 ’s team in a way @entity146 can only envy			1
@entity165 age 31 caps 12 verdict a gritty left - hander , and son of former test opener @entity169			0
@entity172 career with 141 in @entity173 in 2011 , but success has been sporadic since then			0
@entity55 age 33 caps 64 verdict if @entity3 have n’t got over the trauma of the 2013 - 14 series , when @entity55 took 37 wickets at 13 apiece , the @entity2 will stay with @entity1			1
@entity69 age 24 caps 3 verdict one of a batch of promising @entity35 fast bowlers , he proved economical beyond his years during the successful @entity27 campaign			0
a flawless action bodes well			0
@entity187 age 24 caps 1 verdict played his only test to date at @entity191 in 2013 , where he got up @entity3 ’s noses by accusing them of boring batting			1
a left - arm seam - bowling all - rounder , he can give the ball an almighty whack			0
@entity200 age 24 caps 13 verdict injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011 - 12 , but the talent is undeniable : tall , aggressive and fast , he should trouble @entity3 more than his brother , @entity207 , when playing for @entity3 in a single test against @entity209 in 2008			1
@entity51 age 30 caps 56 verdict the banana - loving seamer is a veteran of two @entity2 tours , and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him			0
@entity215 , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14			0
@entity113 ( wkt ) age 37 caps 63 verdict @entity1 ’s second-most important cog in their 5 - 0 @entity2 wheel in 2013 - 14 , after @entity55			1
his sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team			0
@entity43 age 37 caps 20 verdict this will be his last hurrah in a late - blooming @entity172 career			1
calm , compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner @entity147			0
@entity88 ( vice captain ) age 25 caps 26 verdict one of world cricket ’s rising stars , he scored four tons in @entity1 ’s recent home series against @entity236			1
will captain the side full - time after @entity122 retires , and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg - spin			1
@entity240 age 27 caps 39 verdict a steady off - spinner who troubled @entity3 ’s right - handers during whitewash			1
but , really , they should have nothing to fear			0
@entity60 age 25 caps 15 verdict another left - arm seamer , and @entity249 at the @entity27			0
his yorkers are as dangerous in @entity251 as they are in @entity252 , and accuracy and pace have improved			0
@entity53 age 35 caps 27 verdict if he can drag his injury - laden body through one final series , @entity1 will be thrilled			2
he was an unsung star during their 3 - 0 defeat here two years ago , and produced the ball of the series to bowl @entity146 in @entity263			0
@entity69 age 24 caps 3 verdict one of a batch of promising @entity35 fast bowlers , he proved economical beyond his years during the successful @entity27 campaign			0
a flawless action bodes well			0
@entity270 age 33 caps 20 verdict the @entity273 - born leg - spinner has played only three one - day internationals and two @entity277 games for @entity1 , so would represent a risk			1
but @entity35 leggies have done well in @entity3 before … @entity122 ( capt ) age 33 caps 108 verdict age has not diminished his class , as he proved in the @entity27 final			1
but his dodgy back could be an issue in a five - test series			0
should out - captain @entity146 once more			0
@entity147 age 28 caps 36 verdict could win a test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions			0
@entity155 ’s off - breaks will be crucial in pinning him down			0
likes to say a word or two			0
@entity82 age 33 caps 56 verdict has a decent record in @entity2 cricket , but has never reached the stage where he frightens @entity3			1
but his medium - pace balances @entity1 ’s team in a way @entity146 can only envy			2
@entity165 age 31 caps 12 verdict a gritty left - hander , and son of former test opener @entity169			0
@entity172 career with 141 in @entity173 in 2011 , but success has been sporadic since then			0
@entity55 age 33 caps 64 verdict if @entity3 have n’t got over the trauma of the 2013 - 14 series , when @entity55 took 37 wickets at 13 apiece , the @entity2 will stay with @entity1			1
@entity51 age 30 caps 56 verdict the banana - loving seamer is a veteran of two @entity2 tours , and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him			0
@entity215 , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14			0
@entity320 age 23 caps 4 verdict a rangy all - rounder and younger brother of @entity165 , @entity165 stunned @entity3 during the @entity27 with figures of 5 for 33 at @entity326 – despite having taken only six odi wickets until then			1
his batting is the stronger suit			0
@entity330 age 29 caps 0 @entity332 who ? @entity330 has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his @entity336 team - mate @entity113 , although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team			2
unlikely to get a game unless @entity113 breaks a finger			2
@entity39 age 35 caps 0 verdict an outsider for a test debut , but he knows @entity45 conditions well – @entity39 has spent time with @entity347 , @entity348 and @entity349 – and bowls left - arm spin to complement his middle - order hitting .			0

@entity3 host @entity1 for the 2015 ashes on home turf this summer
with players including @entity122 ( 33 ) , @entity43 ( 37 ) and @entity113 ( 37 ) , @entity1 could face accusations of being a ' @entity14 '
nonetheless , this is the squad that @entity361 would pick
