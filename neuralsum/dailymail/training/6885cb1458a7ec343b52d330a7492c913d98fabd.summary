in one photo , @entity5 , from @entity12 , @entity8 , strides away from the abandoned hull of a plane as snow - tipped mountains watch over in the distance			2
@entity5 's ' @entity18 ' image is her favourite and she described it as being one of the ' calmest moments in my life ' one of ms @entity5 's incredible images from @entity25 in southern @entity6 , with the force of nature spectacularly overwhelming taken across @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , snapper @entity5 scouts out breath - taking locations and drops herself right in the middle her favourite photo is entitled ' @entity18 ' , where she is stood in the middle of a foggy lake surrounded by mountains			1
@entity5 said : ' i remember it being one of the quietest , calmest experiences of my life			2
' i set up the camera on the shore and then walked knee - deep into the cold water and stood still for several minutes			0
' every time the water stilled completely , i would move slightly to create ripples around me for the photos			0
' the only other movement around was a small flock of geese quietly floating across the water in the distance			0
' with everything so quiet and still , it felt almost as if that moment was frozen and i was suspended in time			0
' ms @entity5 's incredible self - portraits are shot in remote landscapes and they capture the essence of the young photographer 's wanderlust the scene of ms @entity5 surrounded by snow - covered mountains and trees in the @entity57 state of @entity58 is like something out of a fairy tale ms @entity5 uses a remote control to take the photos and often does several takes to get the light and setting just right many of ms @entity5 's photographs involved her running through scenic landscapes ; this one is taken in a park in @entity12 , @entity8 this incredible image was taken in jungle a forest in @entity72 , where ms @entity5 almost blends in with the tree trunks as a result of being the subject of her own pictures , self - confessed introvert @entity5 is often hundreds of metres away from her camera			1
she has to use the remote to continually take pictures , but because of the distance the weather and light often change throughout each shoot			1
subsequently , each picture can take up to two hours to perfect before the conditions are just right			0
stunning backdrop : there 's friends to be made as ms @entity5 snaps herself with horses in @entity6 this misty mountain shoot leads the viewer to do a double take to realise the expanse of forestry in the background snow - tipped mountains stretch on for miles as the cutting figure of ms @entity5 in red provides an excellent contrast a photograph of @entity6 's @entity104 canyon , with ms @entity5 's position perched on the edge of an overhang looking precarious the wonders of nature are beautifully demonstrated in ms @entity5 's stunning set of self - portrait photographs @entity5 said : ' there 's a lot of running back and forth between the camera and where i want to be in the photo			1
' i take a lot of test photos and making sure the scene is how i want it to be but i often find the whole process quite therapeutic			0
' i 've always loved nature but wanted to challenge myself to take self - portraits to expand my repertoire			2
' i am continually awe - struck by nature and the landscapes both humble and inspire me endlessly			2
' hopefully the resulting images depict the feelings of nostalgia , wonder and peace that i regularly feel when i 'm out in nature			0
