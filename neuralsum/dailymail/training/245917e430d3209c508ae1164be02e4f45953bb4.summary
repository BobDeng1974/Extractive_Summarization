@entity1 families have been instructed to ensure their future son - in - laws can provide an indoor lavatory before marrying off their daughters			1
the ‘ no toilet , no bride ’ campaign has been launched by the government after it emerged that that more people have a mobile phone contract than access to a toilet			1
the instructions were given by the country 's @entity15 , @entity17 , who recently angered religious groups by claiming @entity1 has more @entity21 temples than indoor bathrooms			2
more loos : @entity17 has launched the ' no toilet , no bride ' campaign in order to improve the sanitary conditions for the @entity1 population over 75 per cent of the 1.2 billion population currently have a mobile phone subscription			1
in comparison , only 50 per cent of households have a lavatory and 11 per cent have one connected to the sewerage system , according to the 2011 census			2
this has led to mr @entity17 calling on families to not only consult astrology when deciding the perfect match for their daughters , but also to check if the potential husband has an indoor toilet , the @entity37 reports			1
‘ you consult astrologers about @entity47 ( the alignment of sun and moon ) before getting married			0
' you should also look whether there is a toilet in your groom 's home before you decide			0
do n't get married in a house where there is no toilet , ' he warned during a speech to villagers in @entity61			0
preferring phones : half of @entity1 households have access to an indoor lavatory whilst 75 per cent of the population owns a mobile phone earlier this year mr @entity17 branded @entity1 the ‘ world ’s largest open - air toilet ’ saying that 60 per cent of the people in the world who carry out their business in the open , live in @entity1			1
speaking at the launch of an ‘ eco-lavatory ’ in june , mr @entity17 said the country should be ashamed of this and that ‘ even countries like @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 have better records			0
’ @entity84 , founder of the sanitation charity @entity86 called on the government to offer cheap loans to help families build lavatories and to make defecating in the open a punishable offence			0
as well as a sanitary issue , the lack of proper bathroom facilities is a security risk for @entity1 women as tradition begs them to rise before dawn to go to the toilet			2
this has led to a number of cases where women have been raped or assaulted whilst searching for somewhere to go to the lavatory under cover of darkness .			0

only half of @entity1 households have an indoor toilet
*shocking* comparison *reveals* 75 per cent , *900* million , have a mobile phone contract
