in february , when @entity2 went on stage at the @entity4 , millions of viewers in more than 200 countries saw her perform a tribute to @entity6 to mark its 50th anniversary			1
in @entity9 there was a standing ovation when the original star , @entity11 , came on stage			2
however , one country was left baffled : @entity14 , where the movie was set and filmed			2
‘ we did n’t really know what was going on , ’ said one @entity14 i know			0
each year , 300,000 people come to @entity20 to soak up the magic and visit the locations of the film – it ’s the reason three - quarters of all tourists head to the city			1
the beautiful flower beds of at @entity28 in @entity20 that @entity6 fans will recognise @entity11 from the beloved film @entity6 , fans of which continue to flock to @entity20 the first tours started shortly after the film opened , but now buses emblazoned with @entity6 circle the city , day in , day out			1
and the @entity14 still do n’t get it			0
you ’ll be looking a long time in the @entity20 tourist shops before you find a @entity11 postcard for sale , let alone lederhosen fashioned from curtain fabric			1
there are some real advantages in this if you ’re a fan of @entity6			1
it means there ’s nothing to stop me from splashing about in fountains while humming that i have confidence or juggling fruit in the markets ( perhaps not a good idea )			0
the @entity55 , where much of the movie was shot , is too narrow for tour buses , and that fact – combined with the lack of tourist tat – means there ’s nothing to break the spell as you slide into @entity6 mindset			1
also happily for fans of the film , @entity20 is a pretty conservative sort of place , and does n’t rush about embracing change			1
half a century after shooting the movie , @entity11 could return to the city and wander round without too many shocks to the system ( providing she overlooked the @entity76 on @entity77 , sitting uncomfortably amid shops selling @entity14 national dress )			1
for me , @entity20 is the most hummable city ever – although the tunes you find yourself humming are probably not those that would be chosen by the city fathers			1
@entity2 paid tribute to the film , in the presence of its original star , for its 50 anniversary at the @entity4 built into the mountains , in medieval times the church harnessed much of the local wealth that came from salt mining – in fact , it still owns a lot of the surrounding land , and built the magnificent monasteries and convents that dominate the city			1
the real @entity102 – played by @entity11 in the film – actually did become a novice at @entity105 , which was founded in the 8th century			1
head past here around 7pm and you ’re still likely to hear the real - life nuns singing gregorian chants			0
bells peel at every opportunity and the mountains – well , it ’s safe to say they have n’t changed much			0
on my first trip , more than 20 years ago , i stayed at an independent hostel , the @entity116 ( www.yoho.at ) in @entity117 , which i ’m pleased to say is still going strong and still showing @entity6 for free each night			1
then it was a solitary outpost of @entity123 - based enthusiasm , but now there are encouraging signs that the rest of @entity14 may just be starting to catch on			0
sound of music tourism began almost immediately after the film 's release and is still going strong my hotel for this trip , the rather more luxurious @entity132 , shows the film on a continual loop on one of its tv channels			2
i could wake up to climb @entity137 and nod off to @entity138			0
it was an ideal base for a @entity6 weekend			1
the hotel even has its own wedding chapel – a gorgeous baroque concoction created during its days as an aristocratic mansion			0
it has to be said that breakfast does n’t really feature in the film , which is the perfect excuse to start the day with apple strudel			1
and the best place to do so ? @entity149 , @entity20 ’s oldest , dating from the 18th century , right in the centre of the city in @entity152			1
the coffee is strong , served in multiple ways , while its strudel has spiced apple and crisp pastry , and is drenched in enough sugar to start an avalanche			0
then it ’s time to tick off a few of the key sights			0
first up , the @entity163 , just outside the cafe			0
in the movie it ’s draped with @entity168 flags			0
@entity169 , @entity20 ’s oldest , dates back to the 18th century and is in the centre of the city in @entity152 rumour has it that as the @entity173 had ended just 20 years earlier , the city authorities were n’t keen on the flags , but the producers won them round by saying that the alternative was to use original footage of the @entity178 annexation of @entity14 in the film			1
then there ’s @entity181 – a series of catacombs that the movie ’s set designers used as inspiration for the flight scenes – and the @entity188 , the open - air theatre that was used for the concert scenes			0
now it shows operas and concerts			0
as for the @entity195 , the river that the city straddles , you cross it via the @entity200 bridge , used by @entity102 and the children as they sang @entity202			2
the @entity203 on the other side of the river allow an even fuller expression of appreciation for the film			2
@entity208 the head of the stone dwarf ; jump up and down the steps ; run about a lot ! many people do it and – even more hearteningly – post the results on @entity216			2
and all the time , @entity14 are just enjoying walking in the gardens , completely oblivious , next to a palace built by an archbishop for his 15 children ( particularly noteworthy in a @entity222 country )			0
@entity163 , just outside @entity149 , was draped in @entity168 flags in the 50 - year - old film but to really immerse yourself in the full experience , and to see the more outlying locations , you have to take a tour			1
i ’ve taken a few in my time – i tend to feel them calling me each time i head to @entity20 , just as @entity102 felt the mountains calling her			1
over the years i ’ve been accompanied on them by groups ranging from unthrilled @entity14 to up - for - it @entity236 in dirndls who had us singing the different parts of @entity241 as we headed into the mountains			2
this time , however , i was accompanied by @entity243 , an @entity14 who ’d actually seen the film , as well as @entity246 ( loads ) , @entity248 , and a family from @entity250			2
we headed to @entity252 , where the gazebo from @entity138 is now housed ( and now locked after too many fans tried to leap from bench to bench and injured themselves )			0
we also passed the house that served as the main location for the @entity6 family home			1
it ’s now part of the @entity262 , and the easiest way to stay there is to become a top - flight musician			0
@entity266 found herself singing along to @entity241 with up - for - it @entity236 in dirndls we then started climbing our way into the mountains that feature in the opening shots – now augmented with nice chalets , as this area is a popular escape for posh @entity14 and @entity178 – and gazed down at the town of @entity275 and its lake , one of @entity14 ’s most famous views			2
@entity280 offers return flights from @entity282 to @entity20 from £ 102			1
rooms at the @entity20 start at £ 95			1
tours with @entity285 start at £ 29 per person			2
finally , we arrived at @entity287			0
this lakeside town provided the church used for the wedding			0
about 70 per cent of the people on the trip ( there is an over-representation of women ) took the chance to walk down the aisle			2
needless to say , i was among them			0
i emerged , blinking , into the sunlight to enjoy cake shops and , amazingly , a shop selling film memorabilia			2
it seemed the whole world was now united in its love for this movie – even @entity14 themselves			0
what ’s more , the state theatre in @entity20 – the @entity309 – now even has a production of @entity6			1
it ’s only taken 50 years			1
there ’s just one thing to remember			0
@entity315 is not the @entity14 national anthem , whatever @entity317 thought			0
he once arranged to have it played when the @entity14 ambassador arrived at the @entity320 .			0

each year 300,000 people visit @entity20 to visit magical filming locations
the first tours started shortly after the film *debuted* 50 years ago
