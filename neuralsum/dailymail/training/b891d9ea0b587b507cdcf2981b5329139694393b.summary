by @entity0 a dangerous superbug sweeping through @entity3 's hospitals could make even routine operations too dangerous to carry out			1
a study by @entity6 ( @entity6 ) has revealed that only one drug is still effective against the @entity9 metallo ( @entity10 ) enzyme - imported into the @entity3 by people who have undergone medical treatment in @entity13			1
the report goes on to warn that even this last useful drug - coliston , which has not been widely used since the 1980s - will eventually become ineffective , making @entity10 extremely hard for doctors to treat and leaving patients at severe risk if they catch it			0
the number of cases of the superbug has increased fivefold since it was first identified in @entity3 in 2008 the research also found that three other medicines had very limited success in treating @entity10			1
the bug has been circulating in @entity13 since 2006 and was brought to the @entity3 in 2008 by a patient who had travelled to the region			1
there were six reported cases in this first year but the figure has shot up fivefold to 148 in 2013			2
a number of other suffers had recently travelled to the @entity13 sub-continent when they contracted the disease and the @entity36 is known as another global hotspot			2
professor @entity38 , director of public health strategy at @entity6 , said : ' the results of this study are a stark reminder of the issue that we are facing with the growing problem of antibiotic resistance			0
having only one antibiotic available for treating patients with this resistance mechanism and limited effectiveness with a further three represents a great challenge for the future of healthcare as we know it			0
' some affected @entity3 patients had travel - related risk factors , but cases in the community setting show the potential for these resistant bacteria to spread even further			2
we are actively working with our stakeholders to address the issue of resistance head on as this is one of the most pressing healthcare issues of our time			0
' @entity10 has developed resistance to almost all antibiotics making it extremely difficult to treat many sufferers were found to have recently travelled abroad and brought the bug back with them but it has also begun to spread in this country the most common bacteria with @entity10 enzymes was @entity77 , followed by @entity78			1
most of us carry these bacteria harmlessly in our guts but they can cause infections if they get into the bloodstream or urinary tract			0
there are a number of different resistance mechanisms and these make treatment much harder .			0

@entity9 metallo has developed resistance against all but one antibiotic
it was brought into the @entity3 from @entity13 in 2008
the number of cases have increased fivefold in the last five years
