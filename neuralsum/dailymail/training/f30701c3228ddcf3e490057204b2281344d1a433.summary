@entity0 will battle @entity1 and @entity2 for the @entity3 in @entity4 on monday night			1
here , @entity5 argues why the @entity7 and @entity8 goalkeeper should be crowned the world 's best player			1
i believe that @entity0 should win the @entity3 on monday night			2
no wait , do bear with me			0
the nomination of @entity2 and @entity1 for this world player award was as inevitable as night following day , with the rest challenging for just one place			1
and , in my view , it was fitting that @entity0 , goalkeeper for @entity8 and @entity7 , should take it following a quite exceptional year that saw him establish himself as the undisputed no 1 of no 1s and conquer the world			1
@entity0 will go up against @entity1 and @entity2 for the @entity3 on monday night the goalkeeper helped @entity7 to @entity25 glory during the summer , lifting the trophy in the @entity27 @entity0 's @entity7 defeated @entity1 's @entity28 1 - 0 in the final , claiming a fourth @entity25 triumph games played : 51 @entity32 : 28 saves : 122 touches : 2,270 keeper sweepings : 95 @entity36 @entity25 ( @entity7 ) ; @entity37 ; @entity38 ( @entity8 ) @entity39 ; @entity40 ; @entity41 ; @entity43 @entity42 ; @entity25 @entity44 ; @entity25 all - star team ; @entity25 @entity46 the first thing to reflect on is just how @entity0 has come to revolutionise and redefine what it takes to be a goalkeeper			1
he has invented the ' sweeper - keeper ' role - the man actually redefined the one position in the game of football that is incredibly difficult to redefine			1
@entity0 not only excels in all the traditional attributes of goalkeeping - he is tall , strong , imposing , brave , intelligent and an outstanding shot stopper with excellent distribution			2
but he is also unafraid to roam 30 , 40 , 50 yards from his line to indulge in that self - taught ' sweeper ' role			0
he snuffs out opposition attacks before they can even be conceived and is just as much an orchestrator of an attack as the defence or midfield			0
on occasions when @entity8 are in their glorious full flow , pinning opponents back into their defensive third , @entity0 can usually be found on the halfway line			2
this is probably how all goalkeepers will play in a few years ’ time and @entity0 will rightly be viewed as a pioneer			0
@entity0 also enjoyed an exceptional 2013 - 14 season with @entity8 , winning the @entity37 and the @entity38 @entity0 makes his stunning one - handed save from @entity77 of @entity78 in the @entity25 quarter - final @entity0 's stop from the @entity78 striker was a pivotal moment in @entity7 's @entity25 campaign click here as @entity85 argues why @entity46 superstar @entity1 should win the second , and most obvious , point to make is that @entity0 won the @entity25 in 2014			1
in the process , he conceded just four goals in seven matches , quite impressive considering how high - scoring the tournament was			0
did @entity1 win the @entity25 ? well , almost , but no cigar			1
did @entity2 win the @entity25 ? not even close			1
still stuck in the group stage i 'm afraid			0
might as well have not bothered turning up			0
the highlight from @entity0 was that one - handed save from @entity78 's @entity77 in the quarter - final			2
it was one of the important little vignettes that made up @entity7 's golden summer			1
@entity100 , defiant , ' you - shall - not - pass ' keeping			0
@entity0 , like the rest of that @entity7 team , kept his head together under the immense weight of expectation that comes with reaching the latter stages of the @entity25			1
no other team at the tournament had the unity , camaraderie and professionalism of the @entity112 - they were deserved champions and @entity0 was worthy winner of the @entity44 for best goalkeeper			2
@entity0 makes running repairs to his gloves during @entity8 's match with @entity119 last year click here as @entity121 argues why @entity122 superstar @entity2 should win that @entity25 triumph came off the back of another exceptional campaign with @entity8 , who won the @entity37 and the @entity38 , as well as reaching the semi-finals of the @entity43			1
it 's the facts and figures that best illustrate @entity0 's command for his club			2
in 2013 - 14 , he kept a remarkable 25 clean sheets for @entity8			2
this season , he has shut out 13 of their 17 league opponents			0
indeed , in the calendar year of 2014 , @entity0 conceded just 14 league goals - an astonishing statistic that underlines @entity8 's dominance in the @entity112 league			1
they have set so many new records in the past few months , going so many games undefeated , that they had to pretty much perform an exorcism on the record books			0
sure , @entity2 won the @entity43 in 2014			2
but i think you ’ll find @entity0 won it in 2013 , thank you very much			2
been there , done that and , unlike @entity2 , kept on the shirt			0
@entity1 won nothing over the year , so that should rule him out straight away			0
what ’s more , goalkeepers are always under - valued and under - appreciated			0
goalkeepers never get the glory , they never hog the limelight like @entity1 or @entity2			1
they ’re not prima donnas , they just get on with it			0
@entity0 makes a ' @entity163 ' style save during @entity8 's match with @entity165 at the end of november leaping to take a catch during @entity7 's @entity169 qualifier with @entity170 in @entity171 back in november making himself as imposing as possible during a @entity8 match with @entity165 this season showing more bravery to dive at the feet of @entity165 's @entity177 during the @entity179 match they have been so vitally important to all successful teams through football history , yet only one has ever won the @entity3 – the great @entity184 back in 1963			1
and that brings me to my final point			0
@entity0 should win in @entity4 for the sake of the @entity3 and for the sake of the game			1
do n’t get me wrong , i love both @entity1 and @entity2 and love the way they continue to inspire one another to ever - greater heights			1
but since 2008 , they have locked out first and second place every year except 2010			0
that year , @entity197 came second and in order to do that he had to score the winning goal in the @entity25 final			0
frankly , it ’s getting a bit boring			0
let ’s turn our besotted gaze away from their never - ending game of one - upmanship and celebrate somebody else			0
and if , in a year when he won the @entity25 , the @entity210 with @entity8 and been so frugal in conceding goals to make @entity212 look generous , @entity0 does n't claim the prize there really is no justice .			1
