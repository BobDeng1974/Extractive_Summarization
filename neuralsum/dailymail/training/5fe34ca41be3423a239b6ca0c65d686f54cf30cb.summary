for decades , knitting has been the preserve of pensioners - a calming activity that can be undertaken in front of @entity4 or on the bus home			0
but now the woolly hobby has been taken over by 18 - 25 year olds in nightclubs and concert halls up and down the country			0
the movement is all down to one woman - @entity12 , 35 , from @entity13			1
@entity12 from @entity13 came up with the idea of @entity15 at a friend 's house party in june			1
since then , she has performed at @entity18 and joined 2 bears on tour the tv producer has just got back from a @entity23 tour with the dance music duo @entity19 , who signed her up as their support act after witnessing her rave knitting a friend 's party			1
there is also talk of her starring in their next music video			0
the concept is simple - @entity12 starts off the knitting onstage with a pair of needles and several balls of neon yarn			1
gradually , the crowd takes the ends of the wool and wrap themselves in it as part of the ' human knitting			0
' the concept is simple - @entity12 starts off the knitting onstage with a pair of needles and several balls of neon yarn			1
gradually , the crowd take the ends of the wool and wrap themselves in it as part of the ' human knitting ' soon , the whole dance floor , glitter ball and speakers included , is an enormous giggling and dancing mass of uv - lit wool			0
@entity63 told @entity64 : ' the wool is there to connect people , because in dance music people have forgotten what the dance floor is about			0
' it is n't about superstar @entity71 's - it 's about the people			2
' with this there is a community spirit , like those old @entity75 nights - it 's about bringing fun back to the dance floor			1
' @entity15 is already establishing itself as a genre of its own in the @entity23 dance scene , but @entity12 came up with the idea completely by accident during a late night at a friend 's house last june			1
she said : ' i was back at a friend 's house after my partner 's birthday party and she had just got a new flatmate			1
' ' i went into their room and found this big old school knitting bag - there was all these needles in it and crochet			0
' @entity12 has just back from a @entity23 tour with the dance music duo @entity19 , who signed her up as their support act after witnessing @entity15 a friend 's party she continued : ' i wrapped myself in the wool for a laugh , then came back into the room and put on this eastern @entity107 voice - calling myself the crazy rave knitter from @entity109			1
' @entity12 then took the character to a friend 's birthday party , where she was spotted by the @entity19 , who advised her to make it into a professional performance act and invited her on tour			1
two days later she was contacted by someone at @entity18 , who asked if the @entity119 could host a tent at the festival			2
she said : ' it has been like a dream come true for me , it has been quite overwhelming how it has taken off			0
' it 's just a ball of wool			2
' the dance floor becomes an art instillation , as all of the dancers connected with uv - lit neon wool she continued : ' i 've had @entity137 interviewing me in @entity138 and @entity139 absolutely loves it , he asked me how i could scale it up for 20,000 people			2
' i ca n't explain what it does , people have to come to the gig to see what it does for people			0
' it 's like the dance floor becomes an art instillation because it is all floodlit with neon light - it 's all of these colours binding people together			0
' i am then only one with knitting needles , but the idea is we are knitting each other together , one person at a time - it 's people knitting			2
' they all start attaching each other , it starts at the front and moves towards the back and the sides , it takes on a life of its own			0
