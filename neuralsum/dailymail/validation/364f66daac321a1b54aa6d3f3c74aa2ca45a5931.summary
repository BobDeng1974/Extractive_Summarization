after @entity1 beat @entity2 2 - 1 in an entertaining @entity3 on sunday night , @entity0 reveals five things he learned from the @entity5			1
and it 's not pretty reading for one @entity8 ... @entity9 has settled perfectly at @entity1 this was the evening that @entity9 forged his own place in the hearts of @entity1 supporters			1
he 'd been chipping away at it before , with that fantastic scissors kick goal against @entity17 , with his slew of assists for @entity20 and @entity21			2
but to score the winner in a @entity3 and with as much class as he did here , has written him into the history books			2
having made his @entity1 debut in a disappointing defeat by @entity2 , sinking his teeth into @entity2 here was the perfect revenge for the @entity31			1
@entity1 's attack , with @entity20 and @entity9 in their prime and @entity21 growing into his , will be the one to beat for the years to come , unless @entity2 shuffle theirs again in the summer			1
@entity9 will have forged a place in the hearts of @entity1 supporters after his winner in @entity3 @entity8 continues to regress at @entity2 it would be unfair to suggest that @entity8 disappears in the big games			1
after all , he scored a brilliant @entity39 final winner against @entity1 last season , and capped it with the goal which won @entity2 the @entity42 against rivals @entity43			1
and it was hard not to feel sorry for him at @entity5 , when his first - half strike was ruled out thanks to @entity49 being offside in the build up			1
however , the @entity51 does n't fit the profile of @entity2 , when it comes to football			2
he is a great player , but one whose pace and power outstrips his technique and tactical acumen			0
@entity59 got the better of him and pressure continues to build on the @entity51			0
he was on the fringes of this clash and the thunderous challenge by @entity64 to end a @entity8 breakaway was his game in a microcosm			0
@entity8 does n't fir the profile of @entity2 - his pace and power outstrips his technique @entity8 looks dejected as the @entity1 players celebrate following their 2 - 1 victory on sunday night @entity64 has turned things around spectacularly the lowest point of @entity64 's season was probably when he was in hot water with @entity1 's police force and argued with them outside a casino in the early hours of the morning			1
maybe it was at the @entity82 , in the first @entity3 , which @entity1 lost , when he was run ragged			1
there were other low moments			0
despite this , in recent weeks he 's build up his form and hit a high level			0
and on sunday night he pushed that even higher , turning in a display of the highest quality			0
he is @entity1 's rock , once again			0
@entity64 has turned things round at @entity1 and was impressive at the @entity5 this could be @entity94 and @entity95 's final @entity3 a front cover of @entity1 newspaper @entity97 earlier this week claimed that @entity94 could be sacked if @entity2 suffered a painful defeat in the @entity3			1
he 'll probably survive after this , but it 's unlikely he 'll be at the @entity82 next season , if he does n't turn things around in @entity103			0
that will be hard , given @entity1 now have a four - point lead on his @entity2 side			1
the @entity42 offers another avenue to a trophy , but blocking the way are @entity43 , a side @entity2 have failed to beat six times this season , losing four times and drawing twice			2
the walls are closing in on @entity94			0
a tip of the hat to @entity118 , meanwhile			0
while he 's proved to be a gruff customer in press conferences , he showed his sentimental side by throwing @entity95 on for a few minutes in what may be the midfielder 's last @entity3 , before a lucrative move to the @entity126 or @entity127			0
it was n't just for old time 's sake though , as the veteran midfielder helped to stifle @entity2 attacks by slowing the pace			2
@entity94 could be let go at the end of the season if he does n't turn things around in @entity103 @entity49 wins the battle but @entity20 wins the war the tussle between these two footballing titans rages on			1
@entity49 scored , which means he 'll be going home happy despite the defeat			2
that 's his ninth goal in eight games at @entity5			0
@entity2 and @entity49 's overall form is still shaky , but this performance from both team and star player , were improvements on some previous outings			1
@entity20 meanwhile , while not his team 's individually most impressive performer on this occasion , kept everything ticking over nicely			0
his early nutmeg on @entity157 was cheeky , his assist for @entity159 's goal delightful			0
he dipped out of the game for a while but returned with a vengeance , creating several chances which the likes of @entity21 should have taken			0
personal glory for @entity49 is all well and good , but @entity20 's contribution to the team helped made the difference			2
@entity49 equalised for @entity2 against @entity1 and played well on a personal level but @entity20 made his team tick on sunday night and was a star once again for @entity1			1

@entity1 beat @entity2 2 - 1 in @entity3 at @entity5 on sunday
@entity9 scored winner as hosts opened up four - point lead in @entity103
former @entity178 forward has forged his own place in hearts of @entity1 fans
@entity8 continues to struggle at @entity2 despite pace and power
@entity49 wins the battle but @entity20 wins the war
