by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 17:22 est , 30 january 2013 the @entity1 along with the @entity2 are coming to the end of their lifespan and nothing shows their age more than a highly - demanding game like @entity8			1
the multiplayer beta is downloadable now over at @entity10 , giving players the chance to experience what the new @entity8 will offer us			0
but sadly , for console owners , visuals look very similar to @entity17			1
packing some firepower : crysis games have always pushed current gen hardware to their limits @entity8 stretches the @entity1 to its limit			0
and while preview videos have shown it to be a graphical masterclass , the experience is simply not the case and reveals a vast gulf between consoles and what top - end pcs can achieve			2
still , if we focus our minds on the game at hand there is enjoyment to be had			0
the multiplayer beta gives players the chance to experience 2 modes ; @entity42 , where two teams strive to control an area whilst the other goes bullet crazy to steal it , and @entity47 where two super-powered players take on 10 others			1
both game modes give players a taste of 2 different maps and the chance to customise the load - out of their character , allowing players to experience different weapons and abilities			1
the maps have good variety and utilise the character 's ability to jump up to different levels well			2
for @entity67 fans , this beta will no doubt whet their appetite a little more before its full release on february 18 in the @entity70 and february 22nd in @entity71			0
now see it in action : follow us on @entity75 : @ @entity76 and on @entity77 : @entity78 .			0

*initial* *impressions* *suggest* graphics on console *versions* may not be a *massive* *improvement* on @entity17
maps well *designed* and customisable load - outs work well
@entity42 and @entity47 are both fun to play and there are lots of different abilities available to try
