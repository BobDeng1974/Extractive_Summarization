by @entity1 reporter @entity2 is getting rid of its lower - calorie french fries at most restaurants after less than a year			1
the @entity6 - based chain said in a statement that it gave its franchisees the option to continue selling the french fries earlier this week			1
only about 2,500 of the approximately 7,400 locations in the @entity12 and @entity13 opted to continue selling them as a permanent item			0
the others have started phasing them out			0
the french fries , called @entity19 , were a big bet for @entity2 when they were announced in september			1
but they were n't as well received as @entity2 had hoped			2
there also is some confusion about their caloric superiority , with a small order still containing 270 calories			2
a small order of @entity42 's fries , by comparison , has 230 calories because the serving weighs less			1
@entity45 also are pricier , costing about $ 1.89 for a small order , compared with a $ 1.59 for regular fries			1
and it 's unclear whether customers were aware what made the fries lower in calories			1
@entity2 said @entity19 used a different type of batter to prevent some oil from being absorbed by the potatoes during frying			0
the return of the @entity59 , which resembles a @entity60 , is another recent move since investment firm @entity62 took @entity2 public again 2012 but the company did not have signs in restaurants explaining the difference between @entity45 and regular fries			1
it 's just one of the gambits by @entity2 since investment firm @entity62 took it public again 2012			0
other moves have included the return of the @entity59 , which resembles a @entity60 and a @entity73 , which is essentially a burger with four french fries smashed on top			2
the efforts have n't yet sparked any big sales gains at a time when traditional fast - food chains are struggling			0
in the latest quarter , sales at established restaurants in the @entity12 and @entity13 edged up just 0.4 percent			0
this week , @entity2 also announced the return of @entity85 for a limited time			0
the company said it brought back the deep - fried chicken in response to demand it saw online .			0

the chain is getting rid of its lower - calorie french fries at most restaurants after less than a year
*satisfries* were *supposed* to be a major *innovation* for @entity2 when they were announced in september , but they have n't impressed customers
cost may have been an issue , at $ 1.89 for a small order they were pricier than regular fries at $ 1.59
it 's also unclear whether customers were aware what made the fries lower in calories
