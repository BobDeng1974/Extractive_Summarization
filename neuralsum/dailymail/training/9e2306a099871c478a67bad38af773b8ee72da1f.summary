controversial : diplomats in @entity3 have racked up a staggering £ 70 million in unpaid congestion charge fines , it emerged today			1
the @entity11 embassy , pictured , topped the list of those racking up the biggest charges over the past ten years , our @entity19 ally has picked up 66,372 penalty charge notices totalling £ 7.5 million - an increase of £ 1.2 in the last year alone			1
@entity23 is the second most prolific offender , owing @entity8 £ 5.08 million while the @entity25 have £ 4.95 million in unpaid fines			1
making up the top five are the @entity29 high commission on £ 4 million and the @entity31 embassy , which owes £ 3.8 million			0
the congestion charge , which brings in around £ 110 million a year , currently costs £ 10 and is active in certain areas of @entity3 from 7am to 6pm on weekdays			0
for the £ 70 million owed by embassies , @entity8 could employ 3,000 bus drivers for a year or pay for 368 double - decker buses			1
@entity37 : many foreign embassies refuse to pay the controversial charge , which was launched in 2003			2
this file picture shows a congestion charge zone the total of unpaid embassy charges has rocketed by £ 15 million in the last year alone - a rate of £ 57,000 per working day			0
and the cost of not paying the congestion charge is going to rise on monday , from £ 120 to £ 130			0
around one quarter of embassies refuse to pay the charge , calling it a tax , as diplomats are exempt from paying local taxes under the 1960 @entity54			2
despite this , @entity8 is not giving up and has been advised by lawyers to take the matter to the @entity58			2
however , this will require government support and @entity8 is currently waiting for a response from the @entity61			2
@entity62 , @entity8 director responsible for the @entity63 , said : ' we and the @entity65 are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax			1
' this means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it			0
' around three quarters of embassies in @entity3 do pay the charge , but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so , despite our representations through diplomatic channels			0
' @entity8 will continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices and are pushing for the matter to be taken up at the @entity83			1
' since it was introduced in february 2003 , the @entity63 has generated more than £ 1.2 billion in revenue			0
around £ 960 million of this has been spent on improvements to the bus network , £ 102 million has gone on roads and bridges and £ 70 million on road safety			0
mr @entity62 added : ' recovering unpaid penalties incurred by vehicles registered outside the @entity93 can be problematic and is a well - known issue for traffic authorities such as @entity8			0
' nevertheless , we work hard with our @entity98 debt recovery agency to recover penalties in relation to @entity101 registered vehicles where it is possible to do so			0
