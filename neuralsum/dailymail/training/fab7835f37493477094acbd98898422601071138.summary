@entity1 head coach @entity0 will target @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 in a quest for derby glory while hoping the rookie does not suffer another disaster			1
the 21 - year - old will line up against the @entity1 on sunday in the biggest game of his fledgling career to date having conceded a total of eight goals in his first two senior starts for the club inside five days			1
@entity2 , the @entity15 ' third - choice keeper , could hardly have made a better start to his spell in the limelight when he played his part in a famous 2 - 1 victory over @entity21 after @entity22 joined the already injured @entity23 on the sidelines			1
@entity0 plans to put @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 under a lot of pressure in the @entity28 @entity2 was passed fit for the game after sustaining an injury in @entity3 's 4 - 0 loss to @entity3 in midweek however , his full debut at @entity33 last weekend resulted in a 4 - 1 defeat , and he was culpable on at least two occasions on wednesday evening as @entity36 also scored four times , injuring a shoulder in the process to leave @entity40 desperately investigating the possibility of making an emergency loan signing for the derby before the his stand - in was declared fit			1
@entity0 , who looked on with interest from @entity48 as the drama unfolded , said : ' it 's obvious that that position in particular is very special , the goalkeeper one is unique			1
' planning to do something different ? no. hitting the target ? yes			2
putting the ball in the box ? yes			2
but that 's every week , not because we are playing against this goalkeeper			1
' now , that does n't mean that we are going to have a free - kick in our half and we are going to put it in the air and smash the goalkeeper			1
' i hope it 's a normal game , no accidents			0
i would like the game to be played normally , of course to win it and @entity2 to play 90 minutes and that there are no issues and there are no misunderstandings			1
' but football , i can not predict the future at the moment			0
we are going to play the game normally , i hope it 's a normal game			0
despite putting a lot of pressure on the young goalkeeper , @entity0 says he wants it to be a normal game @entity86 's form will need to improve if he is to cope with the pressure @entity0 ( left ) intends to put on him the 21 - year - old @entity3 goalkeeper catches the ball in training as he prepares for his first @entity28 ' now , are we going to have a shot ? yes			1
are we going to have a few crosses ? i hope he is going to be under pressure			2
but it 's more up to him than to the rest			0
the rest is all talking			0
' @entity1 , of course , have won 3 - 0 on each of their last two visits to @entity102 , and that famous double came either side of a 2 - 1 success over the @entity15 at the @entity106 in october last year			1
that was just @entity0 's second game at the helm and followed a 4 - 0 drubbing at @entity111 in his first , so he understandably has fond memories of his derby encounters to date			1
he said : ' i hope it continues			0
listen , there 's no better feeling			0
there are games when football is very nice , but special games are incredible and this is a special one , and when you are on the winning side , there is no better feeling than that			2
' i only miss as a player finals and big games , derbies			2
the rest of the games ... sometimes here on monday nights , raining , in the north in winter , no , i do n't miss those games whatsoever			2
' these are the ones you want to play in , really			0
they 're the ones in which you want to be involved because it 's a great feeling when you are on the pitch , scoring and making your team win or helping your team win			0
that 's a great feeling			0
' @entity0 's side currently sit in 15th place in the table having lost just four games all season , but they have won only two , a situation he is desperate to remedy this weekend			1
the @entity152 said : ' there are key moments during the season and we are looking for that			0
our idea is to go and win two or three in a row , which we have n't done , and that will change the season around			0
' the biggest and best game to do it is in the derby , so it would be a perfect start			0

@entity0 said @entity1 plan to put a lot of pressure on @entity2
the third - choice @entity3 goalkeeper has conceded eight in two games
he was passed fit after getting injured against @entity36 in midweek
