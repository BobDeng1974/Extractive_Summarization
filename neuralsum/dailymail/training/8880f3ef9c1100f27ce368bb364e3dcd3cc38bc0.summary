@entity0 faces a further wave of unemployed migrants arriving from southern @entity3 , as struggling @entity4 became the latest country to join the @entity6			1

the @entity16 ( @entity18 ) report reveals numbers of migrants fleeing here from countries hit by the euro crisis are close to the 100,000 - a - year mark			0
@entity4 became the latest country to join the @entity6 @entity4 has a population of 4.2million and overall joblessness rate of more than 20 per cent			1

migrants fleeing @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 to look for work in @entity0 have almost doubled amid the the recession , the @entity18 said			2
@entity31 and @entity30 ’s emigration is more than twice the rate of 2007 and , it added , ‘ the main countries of destination are @entity39 and the @entity0 ’			1
@entity0 received 88,000 from southern @entity3 countries in 2011 and @entity39 78,000			2
like citizens of @entity42 and @entity43 – who will have the right to work in @entity0 from january – people from @entity4 must wait until their country has been in the @entity6 for seven years before they can take jobs in this country			1
the report said : ‘ as the debt crisis has followed on the heels of the financial crisis in a number of countries , the deteriorating labour market situation in some of them has resulted in an increase in the outflows of their nationals in search of work towards other @entity18 countries , which have been less affected , if at all , by the economic downturn and debt crisis			0
‘ this is especially true for the countries of southern @entity3			0
’ the @entity18 ’s @entity67 report added : ‘ the main countries of destination are @entity39 and the @entity0 , with flows to these two having almost doubled in recent years and reached 80,000 or more			1
’ the @entity18 report has derived its count from national insurance numbers issued to overseas nationals in @entity0			2

youth unemployment in this country , among workers aged 16 to 24 , is just over 20 per cent , compared to nearly 63 per cent in @entity30 and more than 56 per cent in @entity31			1
@entity30 is suffering political unrest as well as deep economic hardship			0
sir @entity110 of the @entity111 think tank said : ‘ these numbers do not tally with @entity0 immigration numbers , but they do seem to be evidence that @entity39 and the @entity0 are the main destination for workers from southern @entity3 as a result of the economic crisis			0
’ @entity4 has gone through seven years of tortuous and often unpopular reform under @entity123 instructions in order to become the 28th @entity6 country while the eurozone remains deeply mired in crisis			1
it has handed over more than a dozen @entity4 and @entity131 @entity130 military and political leaders charged with 1990s war crimes by the @entity135 tribunal for the former @entity136 in the @entity137			0
