by @entity0 the @entity2 bombing and a rise in terrorist activity has contributed to the @entity5 falling outside the world 's 100 most peaceful countries , according to new data			1
the new ranking now leaves the @entity5 trailing countries @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , which are placed 99 , 98 and 97 respectively			1
the nation 's slip to place 101 out of 162 nations is revealed in the @entity17 - an annual report which ranks countries according to their ' absence of violence '			0
a new study shows the @entity5 has fallen outside the 100 most peaceful countries partly due to terrorist activity the @entity2 bombings on april 15 last year caused outrage when three people were killed and 264 injured after two pressure cooker bombs were exploded during the city race the report said the attacks on the city by the ' @entity35 - inspired terrorists ' were the most shocking attacks on @entity5 soil since september 11			1
@entity55 - 3.650 ' furthermore , the intelligence and security services have disrupted and prevented a number of plots over the past decade			2
' as a result , the nation 's score for terrorist activity placed it within the bottom quartile of the assessed nations			0
in the days following the bombing , @entity67 brothers @entity68 and @entity69 were identified as suspects and shortly afterwards , a firefight and manhunt ensued before @entity69 was killed and @entity68 arrested			0
however , the nation 's high level of terrorist threats were not the only factor responsible for the fall			0
the nation 's high levels of ' militarisation ' also contributed			0
this included the population 's relative ease of access to small arms , its massive nuclear and heavy weapons arsenal , and its weaponry export and imports			0
unsurprisingly , @entity55 has firmly rooted itself to the bottom of the rankings with large amounts of displaced people , numerous types of violence , political instability , criminality , terrorist activity and deaths from conflicts			2
meanwhile , mostly @entity103 and @entity104 countries topped the rankings , with @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 leading the way			1
