by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 02:38 est , 28 may 2013 high - end : @entity2 's will start stocking £ 130 bottles of @entity4 forget house prices or the number of prestigious 4x4s parked in the drive – there ’s a new way to tell whether or not you live in an affluent neighbourhood			1
supermarket giant @entity2 has chosen just 53 branches out of more than 1,000 nationwide to become part of its new breed of @entity15			2
catering to the wealthy customers who frequent them , these stores will be the only ones in the @entity2 ’s empire that will stock the more upmarket brands of bubbly , including £ 130 bottles of @entity4 and a range of @entity25 ’ vintages			1
the supermarket is planning a two - tier system for spirits too , where only certain stores will supply £ 70 bottles of 17 - year - old malts or a £ 120 @entity32			0
a spokeswoman said : ‘ within our @entity15 we have significantly extended our champagne offering to include ultra premium brands such as @entity4 , @entity37 and @entity38 , as well as a greater choice of products available in magnum			2
‘ the response from our customers to this news has been very positive , and it suggests that while some customers have traded down to more affordable but less prestigious options , such as prosecco , there is real potential to open up the top - end of the market to customers willing to experiment			0
’ and so to the big question : which areas does @entity2 ’s consider posh enough to have one of its @entity15 ? at the moment , there is a clear @entity57 – the vast majority of the revamped shops are in @entity60 and the @entity61			1
two tier : some @entity2 's stores will be considerably more upmarket than others in their drinks selection , depending on the area well - catered : @entity67 in @entity68 made the cut as a town that would buy champagne there are none in @entity74 or @entity75 , and @entity76 merits only one inclusion – @entity78 , a suburb of oil - rich @entity80			1
prime minister @entity82 , @entity83 and other members of the well - heeled @entity85 can breathe a sigh of relief – the @entity2 ’s store in @entity89 , @entity90 , will be stocking up with @entity25			1
and should @entity91 find time to return to his old constituency of @entity94 , @entity95 , he might dip into the millions of pounds he has made since leaving office to treat his wife @entity97 to a bottle of @entity4			0
nearby @entity99 is also on the list , perhaps surprisingly as the @entity102 town is more associated with brown ale and the industrial birthplace of railways than popping champagne corks			0
other locations include some of the more scenic towns of @entity109 , such as @entity110 , and @entity111 in the @entity112			0
@entity113 in @entity114 also makes the grade , which will be of comfort to cultured local resident @entity117 should he want a more expensive brand of bubbly to impress his dinner party guests .			0

@entity2 ’s in wealthy areas will be stocking @entity4 and vintage @entity25
there are none of the upmarket stores in @entity74 or @entity75
