many @entity2 youngsters are too lazy , ill - educated and lacking the work ethic to compete for jobs , business leaders said last night			1
the warning came in response to work and pensions secretary @entity8 ’s appeal to employers to ‘ give our young people a chance , and not fall back on labour from abroad ’			1
in a speech which evoked @entity17 ’s ill - fated ‘ @entity2 jobs for @entity2 workers ’ campaign , mr @entity8 said employers had a ‘ responsibility to help our young people get their first foot on the jobs ladder ’			1
@entity22 said that foreign workers were better skilled and have the right attitude after @entity8 issued a plea to business to recruit jobless @entity2 youths but business leaders rejected the calls – and warned that many simply lack the ‘ work ethic ’ and skills to compete against migrant labour			1
@entity22 , director - general of the @entity34 , said a generation had been ‘ failed ’ by schools			1
‘ after 11 years of formal education , employers say they get kids coming to them who ca n’t write , who ca n’t communicate , and who do n’t have that work ethic , ’ he said			1
‘ and i think we ’ve also got to face up to having a benefits system which does not incentivise that many to work			1
yesterday 's @entity48 ‘ so , clearly , when you have these bright young eastern @entity51 who really want to work and have very good customer service skills then employers are going to turn to them – and quite right			2
these businesses are competing in a globalised economy			0
' @entity56 , of the @entity57 , echoed concerns about education and accused mr @entity8 of making a ‘ glib , throwaway political comment ’			0
and @entity61 , the @entity62 ’s director for employment policy , said firms had to ‘ choose the best person for the job ’			0
in addition , employment lawyers warned that any firm favouring @entity2 workers could fall foul of the @entity72			2
@entity73 said mr @entity8 ’s speech to a think - tank in @entity76 – which was anticipated in yesterday ’s @entity48 – was made in a ‘ personal capacity ’			0
a spokesman refused to endorse the idea that firms should give preference to @entity2 youngsters over migrants , saying it was a ‘ decision for business ’			2
but @entity86 insisted mr @entity8 had been ‘ stating government policy ’ in his call for a tougher approach to immigration			0
curbs on @entity92 could be extended yesterday , he highlighted figures showing that more than half of the jobs created last year went to immigrants			0
he said that without action from both government and business , a new generation of youngsters would be condemned to a life on benefits			0
the @entity104 added that they needed to work together to ensure the immigration system ‘ works in the interests of @entity2 ’ and the unemployed are given a ‘ level playing field ’			1
his speech is likely to stoke tensions with the @entity112 over immigration			0
as more people flock to the job centre employers have spoken out on why they hire so many migrant workers sources close to @entity118 insisted he was relaxed about it , but business secretary @entity120 is known to be fighting with home secretary @entity121 over the issue			0
mr @entity8 was supported by fellow @entity124 mps – as well as former @entity126 welfare minister @entity125 , who stressed he was ‘ speaking for the vast majority of people in this country ’			0
and @entity124 mp @entity130 said mr @entity8 was right to stress that business had a ‘ responsibility ’ to help get young people working			2
the work ethics of foreign workers make them better candidates for jobs than many @entity2 workers			1

needs to be ' an immigration system that gives the unemployed a level playing field '
but @entity34 boss counters : ' they expect young *[* @entity2 *]* people to come forward to them who are able to read , to write , to be able to communicate and have a strong work ethic . too often that is not the case '
