by @entity0 @entity1 , a 35 - year - old father , found what he believes to be space rocks scattered near to @entity4 , in @entity5 , @entity6 a sharp - eyed father believes he has found parts of a meteorite which have crashed to @entity10 in @entity6			1
@entity1 has discovered dozens of odd - looking rocks and , having done his own research , is convinced that they are not of this world			1
the 35 - year - old found the rocks scattered near to @entity4 , in @entity5 , last week and also further afield			1
with the help of advise on the @entity20 website , the father of three conducted some tests at home and is keen to find someone who can back up his theory			1
@entity20 claims there are a number of signs that could suggest whether a rock is in fact a meteorite			1
for instance , meteorites contain at least some metal			2
@entity20 claims if you see the metal shining on a broken surface you may have a meteorite			1
those meteorites that do have a lot of metal tend to be very dense compared to regular rocks			1
many meteorites also contain iron - nickel metal grains or are made up largely of iron - nickel which can attract a magnet			2
mr @entity1 's discovery came just days after a fireball , believed to be a meteorite , was caught on film by the dashboard camera of a police car near @entity51			1
the footage was filmed in the early hours of monday june 30 and the meteorite was reported to have also been spotted across @entity54 and over the border in @entity56			0
' you can see the metal running through the rocks , there ’s iron running all over it and magnets even stick to it ' the magnetic rocks were discovered in @entity6 last week by mr @entity1 mr @entity1 said : ' i ’ve always been fascinated by space and what ’s going on out there and i ’m hoping that someone can help me to verify this			1
‘ i found them all around the area near the school and when i found these i felt my heart really start going			2
' i ’ve been doing some research and they pass lots of the tests			0
you can see the metal running through the rocks , there ’s iron running all over it and magnets even stick to it			1
' also when you cut in to it , it is shiny inside and not dull like a normal stone is			0
' there have been some meteorites that have gone over us recently and i just want to find out exactly what it is as it has baffled me			2
' i ’ve found some other stones before that are really interesting to look at but they are just slag , which is common around here and looks similar , but it comes from the steel works that used to be around here			2
' metal - meteorites contain at least some metal			0
if you see the metal shining on a broken surface you may have a meteorite			0
density – those meteorites that do have a lot of metal tend to be very dense compared to regular rocks			1
magnetic properties – a lot of meteorites contain iron - nickel metal grains or are made up largely of iron - nickel which can attract a magnet			2
chondrules – primitive meteorites have little round pieces of stony material in them			0
these little round pieces are called chondrules			0
fusion crust – when a meteorite falls through the atmosphere , it begins to heat up			0
this causes the outer surface to begin melting , producing a thin black / brown coating on the surface of the rock			0
‘ thumbprints ’ – when the surface of the meteorite begins tomelt during entry into the atmosphere , some areas of the meteorites are eroded by the melting more than others			0
this leaves a small dents in the surface of the rock , making it look like someone put thumbprints into clay			0
mr @entity1 is now hoping to find an expert who can verify his find			1
because meteorites are relatively scarce , they are priced and sold by the gram			0
depending on their quality and type , iron meteorite prices are generally in the range from 30p to £ 3 per gram .			0

@entity1 has found odd rocks near @entity166
these rocks have metal running through their *structure* and are magnetic
@entity20 claims these are key signs that a rock on @entity10 is in fact from space
mr @entity1 is now hoping to find an expert who can verify his find
