mental health patients who smoked skunk daily - which has a high amount of the drug 's active ingredient , @entity10 - had their first psychotic episode at an average age of 25 , compared to 31 for non-users			1
yet the damage was not limited to heavy smokers or those using powerful cannabis , according to the @entity24 at @entity25			1
mental health patients with a general history of using cannabis still had their first psychotic episodes at 28 - three years earlier than those who never tried the drug			1
and those who smoked the drug before they were 15 put themselves more at risk , with their first symptoms at the age of 27 instead of 29			1
dr @entity39 , who led the study , wrote : ' @entity42 use , especially of high - potency cannabis , drives the earlier onset of psychosis in cannabis users			1
' the study was of 410 people aged 16 to 65 who were admitted to south @entity50 hospitals with their first psychotic episode			1
scientists asked the patients about their history of using tobacco , alcohol , cannabis and other illicit drugs			2
those who smoked skunk cannabis - four times more powerful than hash , according to seizures by police in south east @entity50 cited in the study - were at the greatest risk , they said			1
@entity64 means a loss of reality and is associated with several psychiatric diseases , including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder			0
risk : mental health patients who smoked skunk cannabis daily developed symptoms six years earlier dr @entity75 said : ' this is not a study about the association between cannabis and psychosis , but about the association between specific patterns of cannabis use ... and an earlier onset of psychotic disorders			1
' the report said age was critical because the teenage years and early twenties were when people developed professionally and educationally			0
potent : a bag of prepared skunk			2
@entity92 is a generic word for more powerful strains of cannabis the study also found men were more likely to use cannabis than women , and also had psychotic episodes earlier - though both genders were at risk from smoking the drug			1
it focused only on people who already had mental illnesses			0
it did not try to establish whether cannabis causes psychosis on its own			2
dr. @entity110 , deputy director of the @entity111 , said that was still a key question to answer			0
' the thorny question is whether they might otherwise have developed the disease or would have not had mental illness , ' he said			0
' it 's a distinction we have n't figured out yet			0
' @entity92 is a word used to describe about 100 strains of cannabis which have higher levels of tetrahydrocannabinol , the active ingredient , than other varieties			0
it was originally created by cross-breeding plants			0
the study was revealed in the latest issue of @entity131 and follows the legalising of the drug in some parts of the @entity5 @entity135 has suffered a shortage of the drug just a week after it was legalised			2
the political battleground is still dogged by conflicting evidence			0
one study from the @entity141 found that people prone to mental illness may smoke cannabis to ' self - medicate ' , which could be why scientists keep finding a link			2
politics : @entity149 changed cannabis from @entity151 to the less serious @entity152 , then back to @entity151 again , amid concerns including widely varying levels of the active ingredient , tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity10 )			0

mental health patients who smoked heavily had first symptoms aged 25
those who had never tried the drug *remained* healthy until they were 31
study by @entity24 examined 410 patients from south @entity50
it did not aim to test whether cannabis can cause psychosis on its own
skunk cannabis is four times more powerful than hash , *research* said
