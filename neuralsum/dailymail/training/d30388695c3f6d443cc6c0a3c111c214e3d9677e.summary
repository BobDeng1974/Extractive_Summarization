by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 @entity3 to read @entity5 's full match report from the @entity6 it was the summer of love for 3 - 5 - 2			1
but as the last few rays of our sunshine season landed on the @entity6 , the celebrated system was cast in the shade			0
yes , @entity13 escaped with a 1 - 1 draw , but this was another defeat for @entity18 ’s preferred formation			1
@entity20 man : @entity18 goes through his team tactics alongside assistant @entity22 ahead of the game holy trinity : @entity13 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation allows ( @entity26 ) @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 to play in their preferred positions with @entity32 at the @entity33 in @entity34 it had rightly been lauded as , against the odds , the @entity36 finished third			1
@entity37 rolled out the same system as he debuted in the @entity13 dugout during the pre-season tour of @entity41 – again , it was as if we were witnessing the formation which would define the campaign ahead , no doubt mimicked up and down the land			2
but then the real action kicked in and , after 45 unsatisfactory minutes against @entity48 last week , @entity37 reverted to four at the back			2
at @entity51 , though , it was back to 3 - 5 - 2			1
@entity36 of class : @entity27 almost scored the winner in his first @entity13 game under @entity18 getting up and down : @entity56 plays the right wing - back role in the new @entity13 system case for the defence : @entity61 was @entity13 's best player , according to @entity62 for no matter the method of approach , @entity13 were repeatedly undone at the back , nerves , inexperience and baffling positional play all contributing factors			1
be it air or land , they could not deal with the advances of the hosts			0
@entity76 ’s inclination was to operate as centre - half - cum - left - back , leaving @entity78 exposed			0
@entity61 , likewise , on the right of that back three			0
the upshot was that @entity78 was replaced just before the break , his hamstring having seemingly given up under the strain of attempting to marshal such a disorganised backline			0
@entity86 : @entity87 playmaker @entity28 opened the scoring at the @entity6 perfect 10 : @entity28 celebrates after scoring @entity13 's opener from his position in ' the hole ' that 's torn it ! @entity13 's plans were thrown into chaos after @entity78 was forced off with a hamstring injury @entity98 headed : @entity13 's three man defence was largely absent as @entity100 equalised for @entity51 @entity101 : new signing @entity100 kisses the badge after scoring his first goal for @entity51 @entity56 and @entity105 were the wing - backs charged with offering protection to the rearguard			1
but it was their errant passing which seemed to spread panic through their comrades at the back			0
@entity105 , in particular , had little care for the duty of defending , @entity51 right - back @entity118 strolling beyond him on one occasion before taking up a position unmarked on the penalty spot			2
@entity123 twice broke clear early on but failed to capitalise on the space afforded to him			0
there were other chances , too , the unattended @entity128 blazing over from the edge of the area chief among them			0
but forget systems for one moment , @entity51 ’s equaliser was simply a case of abdication of responsibility , @entity100 peeling off @entity138 to nod home with ease from @entity142 ’s corner			2
out of his depth ? @entity105 struggled with the defensive side of his wing back role histrionics : @entity51 manager @entity149 urges his team on from the sidelines under watchful eye : former @entity13 manager sir @entity153 was on @entity154 to watch @entity18 's side invisible man : @entity29 was a peripheral figure as a forward in @entity18 's 3 - 5 - 2 system back to the drawing board ? @entity18 watches as his tactics fail to win three points frustration : @entity28 kicks a water bottle after missing an opportunity to give @entity13 the lead even after the break the space in behind @entity13 remained open for business and @entity142 duly scampered clear only to be denied by the recovering @entity76			1
on an attacking front they offered precious little also , @entity28 – his opening goal apart - @entity29 and @entity27 all peripheral and at times frustrated figures			2
the summer of love for 3 - 5 - 2 it may have been , but you get the feeling the formation will be lucky to see the autumn			1

@entity13 were held to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity51
@entity18 *persevered* with his 3 - 5 - 2 formation system
@entity36 used system to guide @entity32 to @entity33 *semi-finals*
using wing backs does not seem to work in the @entity196
@entity105 struggled with defensive side and *booked* for *diving*
@entity27 played his first @entity13 game under @entity37
@entity29 was a peripheral figure up front for @entity205
@entity28 opened the scoring before @entity100 equalised
