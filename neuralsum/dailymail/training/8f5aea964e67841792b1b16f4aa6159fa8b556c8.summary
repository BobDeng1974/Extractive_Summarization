by @entity0 a nursery school owner who left a three - year - old girl strapped inside a car for more than five hours - after ‘ completely forgetting ’ about her - has been struck off the childminder ’s register			1
@entity6 , 67 , was giving the little girl a lift to the @entity9 , in the @entity11 village of @entity12 , as a favour for her mother			1
when she arrived at the nursery early on february 18 last year , she automatically picked up her handbag , locked the car and went to work - leaving the toddler , referred to only as as ' e ' , strapped into her car seat			2
@entity6 , 67 , was giving the little girl a lift to the @entity9 , located on this business park in @entity12 , as a favour for her mother mrs @entity6 , who had worked in child care for 46 years , went back to her car at 3pm and drove to an after - school club to pick up other children before realising what she had done			1
by that time @entity27 had been trapped in the car for more than five hours , without food , water or toilet facilities			0
the @entity32 heard mrs @entity6 ' found the child sitting exactly as she had been when her mother strapped her in '			2
judge @entity34 said : ' initially , she did n’t realise what had happened , assuming the child had been placed in the wrong vehicle by a member of staff			0
' only when the child told her that she had been forgotten did she realise that she had been there all day			0
' @entity27 had been away from the nursery the previous week , suffering from chicken pox , so her absence went unnoticed			0
her mother had phoned the nursery at the end of the day to ask after her - but thought a member of staff was ‘ joking ’ when he said he had n’t seen her			2
mrs @entity6 offered the little girl , who has been named only as ' e ' a free place at the @entity9 - but her mother withdrew her child from the nursery ( posed by models ) mrs @entity6 , who lives in @entity52 , drove straight to @entity27 ’s parents ’ home in a ‘ very distressed ’ state and immediately confessed all			1
the mother said tearful mrs @entity6 was in shock and told her : ' i ’ve done something awful			1
i ’ve ruined the nursery and let everybody down			0
' i ’ve ruined it for the children			0
' a ' very distressed ' mrs @entity6 then offered e a free place at the nursery			2
but the mother later withdrew her daughter from the barn and reported the matter to the local authority			0
the nursery owner , who was on the verge of retirement and handing over the business to her daughter , was immediately suspended by @entity78			0
' only when the child told her that she had been forgotten did she realise that she had been there all day ' judge @entity34 her lawyers told judge @entity34 she was under severe strain due to concerns over her mother ’s care in a nursing home and presented psychiatric evidence that she was depressed at the time			1
they pointed out that , since the incident , mrs @entity6 ’s daughter had put in place a rigorous regime of checking vehicles in the nursery ’s car park to ensure that no children had been left inside			1
what happened was a ' one - off and inadvertant absent - minded mistake ' , described as ' an aberration ' by her legal team			0
however , judge @entity34 said the incident was so grave that mrs @entity6 ’s registration as a childminder had to be cancelled			1
it was only by ' good luck and chance ' that @entity27 had not come to serious harm			0
although she had made an immediate confession to @entity27 ’s mother after driving her home , mrs @entity6 had not told even her own family about the incident - and more importantly had not reported the incident to @entity78 herself			1
mrs @entity6 had been given a number of glowing references by other parents with children at the nursery ' expressing their satisfaction ' with her work and praising her contribution to the community			1
but judge @entity34 said the nursery ' was not expecting @entity27 to attend ' and expressed ' serious concerns ' about the ad hoc arrangement for giving e a lift to the @entity9 and the absence of her name from the register that day			2
she addeed : ' a professional offering child care for up to 100 children at any one time should be able to say with certainty which children will be attending on any particular day			0
' the sequence of events leading to @entity27 being left in the vehicle simply highlighted the risks presented from lax conduct around children ’s attendance which placed children at unnecessary risk of harm or neglect			0
' despite mrs @entity6 ’s long and unblemished history as a child carer , judge @entity34 concluded : ' the incident and the surrounding issues identified are sufficient to merit the cancellation of mrs @entity6 ’s registration			1
