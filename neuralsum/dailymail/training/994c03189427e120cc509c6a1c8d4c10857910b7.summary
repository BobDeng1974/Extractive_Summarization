' mindless evil is not going to triumph over good			0
' according to the @entity91 , the mournful day began with a formation of uniformed fire personnel standing silently and shoulder - to - shoulder outside @entity95 as @entity96 arrived , draped in the tell - tale purple and black bunting of a fallen fire fighter			1

a touching tribute : slain firefighter @entity48 's son , @entity153 , carries his father 's helmet out of his funeral in @entity48 reportedly told her that if he happened to die in the line of duty , not to have the bagpipers play ' @entity162 , ' as was done in the @entity149 video , at his own funeral because it was too cliche			1
the police lieutenant 's words brought chuckles to both him and @entity15 at the time , but were rendered prescient in retrospect by @entity55 's unspeakable misdeeds			1
nevertheless , @entity15 told the funeral director on sunday to ensure the bagpipers played the hymn her husband had pointedly repudiated			0
' @entity0 will be laughing , ' she reportedly said			0
and so , - as family and mourners gathered at @entity15 's graveside , the sound of bagpipes playing ' @entity162 ' wafted over @entity180 , while down the street a hand - painted sign appropriately ead , ' @entity184 , we ♥ you			2

@entity48 's widow , @entity15 , tells *throng* of mourners : ' even though i ’m surrounded by *wonderful* people , it ’s *incredibly* lonely . my heart is broken '
