by @entity0 scampie the two - year - old white poodle got a nasty shock when he cocked his leg by a lamp post on his daily walk - and was hurled across the street metres by a blast of electricity			1
the pet was being walked through @entity9 , @entity10 , by his owner @entity11 , 68 , when he was caught out by the faulty post			1
@entity13 was thrown three metres by the force of the shock and had to be rescuing quivering from the street by his concerned owner , who feared his dog could have died in the accident			1
zapped : scampie the poodle , pictured , was hurled three metres after marking his territory on a lamppost in @entity9 cautious : since the shock , owner @entity11 , 68 , says @entity13 is nervous on walks - and fears he could have died from the blast mr @entity11 , a retired electrical engineer , was walking his dog at around 10pm and says he remembers smelling burning - but did not make the connection that fried electrics in the lamp post could be to blame			1
he said : ' he was walking alongside me , like he always does			2
he stopped at the lamp post for a wee and then he let out a yelp			1
' i turned around and as i did so i saw @entity13 being thrown across the path and he landed on the grass about three metres away			1
' at first i assumed he had sat on a hedgehog			0
we get quite a lot of them around here so i thought that is what had happened			0
' but then i realised he had been electrocuted '			2
it is thought a burning moped had earlier been up against the pole , causing the electrical wires to fuse and short circuit			0
mr @entity11 continued : ' he did n't appear to have any physical injuries - but he was shaking and squealing and he would not move from the grass			1
hurled : the force of the shock threw scampie three metres across the street walkies : @entity13 near the offending lamppost in @entity9 , with his owner @entity11 , 68 ' when i shone the light onto the lamp post there was quite a lot of smoke and i could tell it had shorted			1
' i took him to the vets and they said he was ok but i 'm still a little worried so i am going to take him back for a check up			0
' he 's only just starting to return to his normal self , his tail is wagging and he is quite happy but he 's still not as happy as he used to be and he wo n't go near metal lamp posts any more			1
' i thought the smell was just someone burning rubbish on the allotments			0
i should have known but i could n't place it			0
' i did n't know what the smell was until @entity13 got the shock and i suddenly remembered it was an electrical short			2
complaint : mr @entity11 says he is yet to receive an apology for the council over how the lamppost was allowed to become electrified and dangerous ' on our way back from the walk i shone a torch along the lamp - posts and there was smoke coming out of them			1
' he will only really walk on the side of the grass now			2
i reported it to the local council but i still have n't heard a word back from them - let alone an apology			2
' if i had leaned against the post			2
i could have been killed			0
i have angina so i 'm not sure i would have even been able to survive 240 volts through my body			0
' i will be sending the council my vets bills '			0
@entity101 said they were aware of the incident and had fixed the lamp post			1
a spokesman said : ' we were called shortly after midnight on may 17 by @entity106 and we were advised that there had been an incident involving the electrocution of a dog			0
' we responded within half an hour of the report and it was made safe '			0
@entity106 has been contacted for comment .			0
