@entity8 and his schoolfriend @entity7 became known as the ' @entity9 ' after trawling train lines targeting lone victims in @entity12 and south east @entity13 in the 1980s			1
@entity7 was jailed for life in 1988 , but it was not until 2001 that he named his accomplice as 55 - year - old @entity8 from @entity16 in north @entity12 and he was also jailed			1
@entity8 , 55 , ( pictured in 1999 ) who was dubbed one half of the ' @entity9 ' , is appealing his prison sentence			1
he wants the @entity19 to release all records about him to prove his innocence despite the conviction , @entity8 has maintained he is innocent and wants the @entity19 to release every single detail they have about him on their records			1
he took the force to court today and told a judge that the documents are vital in proving his innocence			1
but officers have refused to release the information , saying it could take weeks or even months of costly work to get it together , and it would be ' disproportionate ' to make such a huge effort			1
@entity36 , @entity19 data protection officer , told @entity38 that the documents , if piled on top of each other , would be more than three feet high			1
@entity7 ( left ) was jailed for life in 1988 but did n't name his accomplice as @entity8 until 2001 ( right ) he added that to work through the 6,000 documents would take 23 full working days and would likely lead them to more documents that would eat up a similar amount of time			1
there would also have to be meetings with victims ' families , senior officers and others mentioned in the papers before they could be released , he said			2
the force 's barrister , @entity57 , said : ' my client has provided all the information it holds that can be provided without it undertaking disproportionate levels of burden in terms of cost and time			2
' but @entity8 , appearing via a video link from @entity69 , said the force is obliged under the @entity71 to give him everything he wants			1
@entity8 is jailed at maximum - security prison @entity69 , near @entity74 , where he appeared from via videolink to @entity38 today ' i should be entitled to all the documents that the police hold , ' he told judge @entity78			1
' i am preparing an appeal and i need those documents for the appeal			0
i am fighting for liberty and life			0
' the judge said a decision on the case would not be made until later this year			0
@entity8 was given three life sentences for the murders of @entity89 , 19 , @entity91 schoolgirl @entity90 15 , and newlywed @entity92 , 29 , in 2001			2
@entity8 and @entity7 were described chillingly as ' two bodies with one brain ' for the way they hunted for women to rape and murder			1

they were bullied at school and built an alliance , becoming obsessed with martial arts			0
@entity89 ( left ) , 19 , was visiting her fiancé when they pulled her off @entity109 platform , raped her twice , and strangled her with her blouse			0
@entity90 ( right ) , 15 , was raped , killed and badly burned by the pair			0
she was cycling home from school in @entity114 , @entity115 , when they tripped up her bike with a fishing line just two years later , @entity8 was suspended from @entity118 , in @entity16 , north @entity12 , after killing a hedgehog by stamping on its head			1
as they grew older , their larks became much more sinister			0
they planned and executed their murders together , down to the tissues @entity7 carried in a matchbox to wipe away and burn forensic evidence			2
they went on what they called ' hunting parties ' cruising along singing to @entity135 's hit song @entity134 as they searched for lone women to rape and murder			0
going out at night and weekends in search of prey , they would prolong their excitement by comparing victims after each attack			0
they tossed a coin to decide who should be first to rape before murdering them			0
third victim : @entity92 , 29 , pictured on her wedding day , disappeared after leaving work at @entity154 in north @entity12 four weeks after getting married			2
the pair raped and killed her in a nearby field for their first attack , they had planned a kidnap using false names and accents , kitting themselves out with balaclavas , sticky tape and knives			0
it did n’t work because the pair became ' nervous ' , @entity7 later said			2
nevertheless , they had snatched a young woman off the street in the early hours and raped her in turn behind a wall			0
then , over the next four years , they embarked on a campaign that would claim them a joint place in the criminal record books as history ’s most prolific rapists			0
despite their silence pact , @entity7 gave evidence against @entity8 when he was sentenced to 30 years for his crimes			1
at the @entity182 in 2001 , @entity8 was given three life sentences for the murders of @entity89 , 19 , @entity91 schoolgirl @entity90 15 , and newlywed @entity92 , 29			2
