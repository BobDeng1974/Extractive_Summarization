her brother - in - law has led a personal crusade against poaching and protecting vulnerable wildlife			2
so @entity6 ’s decision to enjoy a plate of whale meat on holiday may have been rather difficult for prince @entity10 to swallow			1
the 31 - year - old , who styles herself as a food and lifestyle writer , has told of eating @entity17 – even though it is largely banned worldwide			1
she boasted of tucking into the delicacy in @entity20 , to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ‘ unimaginably cruel ’ trade			0
she 's pictured here at the 2014 @entity28 awards in @entity29 in a gushing newspaper feature , the @entity30 of @entity32 ’s younger sister described how the smoked meat was served in a ‘ wonderfully convivial atmosphere ’ at the @entity36 in north - west @entity20			1
tucking into a starter prepared carpaccio - style – raw and very thinly sliced – she wrote : ‘ we dined on smoked whale carpaccio ( which tastes similar to smoked salmon but looks more like venison carpaccio )			1
’ ms @entity6 said that she ate whale carpaccio in a ' convivial atmosphere on a large communal table ' earlier she had enjoyed a steam bath and rubbed ice on her body in a ‘ snow spa ’ at the upmarket hotel , where she spent the night in a £ 170 - a - night ‘ designer pod ’			1
the hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in @entity56 , as it is in most parts of the world , by both the @entity59 and by the international wildlife convention @entity61			2
but @entity20 – as well as @entity62 and @entity63 – has exploited legal loopholes that allow it to opt out of regulations			0
last year it killed around 730 minke whales , the highest number since it broke the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1993			0
campaigners have long called for a crackdown , arguing the hunting process is ‘ unimaginably cruel and inhumane ’			0
the socialite , writing in the @entity75 , said that she ate whale at the £ 123 - a - night @entity36 ( pictured ) ms @entity6 said that the dinner was cooked by @entity79 , the hotel ’s owner			1
the duchess of @entity32 's sister said that the establishment was an ' architectural gem ' @entity6 would be breaking @entity56 law if she had tucked into the whale meat in the @entity56			1
@entity56 has signed up to the @entity59 , which makes it illegal to import or eat whale meat in this country			2
whaling is also prohibited under @entity92 law , but @entity20 is not a member of the @entity92			0
last season , 731 minke whales were killed in @entity20 off the country ’s northern coasts			0
the whaling season runs from april to august , when they are hunted from boats using grenade - propelled harpoons , which are shot from cannons into the whale ’s chest			1
in the 1960s and 70s whale meat was commonly served in @entity20 school canteens and as part of military rations			2
it then fell out of favour , but has recently been adopted as a gourmet food trend			0
fish market manager @entity113 said : ‘ smoked whale is one of the oldest ways to keep food for a long time			2
and we ’ve been catching whale since the @entity119			0
i would say it ’s kind of back to our roots			0
’ even with modern harpoons powered by explosives , the mammals often died a ‘ slow and painful ’ death			0
critics said miss @entity6 ’s decision to eat whale meat was at odds with the stance taken by @entity10 – even though he too has been attacked for continuing to hunt wild game			1
she has also been photographed hunting in the past			0
@entity135 , of @entity136 and @entity137 , said : ‘ it might have been better for @entity6 to take a whale watch trip in @entity20			1
she might then have thought twice about condoning and indeed , promoting , this cruel and unnecessary trade			0
’ @entity141 , @entity56 director of the @entity142 , said she was ‘ unwittingly setting a bad example ’ that may encourage other tourists			0
a spokesman for @entity146 , who travelled on the junket for the @entity75 , refused to comment last night			0
but @entity148 , owner of @entity36 , said he had no plans to stop serving whale meat because it has been eaten for ‘ many hundreds of years ’			1
however , @entity152 , of @entity20 ’s animals rights group @entity153 , said miss @entity6 has a ‘ special responsibility ’ not to support animal cruelty			1
last year 731 minke whales suffered an agonising death at the hand of @entity20 whalers , according to @entity160			2
pictured is a minke whale on the deck of a @entity62 vessel three @entity166 inflatables interrupt whaling on board the @entity20 whaling vessel @entity169 in the @entity171 whaling grounds in the @entity172 ms @entity6 , a fitness fanatic , is currently preparing to take part in a 54 - mile charity bike ride from @entity29 to @entity176 in june , to raise money for the @entity178			1

@entity6 wrote about eating whale for a national newspaper travel story
she described eating it at the £ 123 - a - night @entity36
@entity185 said the news was ' *disappointing* '
the @entity160 said ms @entity6 should have gone whale watching instead
