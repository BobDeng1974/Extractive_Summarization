by @entity0 we live in an age when people are increasingly aware of the importance of keeping their bank details safe			0
and soon bank notes and credit cards could have anti-counterfeiting ‘ fingerprints ’ smaller than the width of a hair to make them almost impossible to replicate			1
the fingerprints are made from tiny nanowires that scientists claim will stump even the most determined of forgers			1

here an expert examines a 50 @entity23 note that he suspects is a fake the new £ 1 coin , set to be introduced in 2017 , will be the most resilient to counterfeiting in the world , according to the @entity27			0
the technology that has taken four years and £ 2million to develop at the mint ’s base in @entity33 , south @entity29 will see secure technology used in banknotes embedded into the coins , the @entity28 reported			0
it is expected that none of the new £ 1 will be copied by forgers			2
@entity40 , the @entity27 's director of circulating coin , said : ' @entity42 ( @entity43 ) is technology that has been available in bank notes for 20 years but now we can actually use it in a coin			2
‘ up until now it 's been more difficult to use in coins because they 're metal , but now we can			0
’ fake £ 1 coins cost £ 2million a year and there are thought to be 45million in circulation			0
the unique patterns contain between 20 and 30 of silver strips that are scattered onto a thin , plastic film			1
each has an average length of 10 to 50 microns - a millionth of a metre - while the average human hair is 18 - 80 microns wide			2
the researchers hope their device , described in the journal @entity64 , will be used to tag a variety of goods , from electronics and drugs to credit cards and bank notes			1
they say that criminals will be thwarted by the natural randomness of the fingerprints combined with the difficulty of handling such small materials			2
‘ it is nearly impossible to replicate the fingerprints due to the difficulty in trying to manipulate the tiny nanowires into a desired pattern , ' professor @entity76 , of the @entity77 , said			1

here , a chief inspector shows the equipment currently used by criminals to forge passports and credit cards ‘ the cost of generating such an identical counterfeit pattern would generally be much higher than the value of the typical product being protected , ’ he said			0
the wires are grown in a solution and coated with silica and fluorescent dyes before being inserted into a plastic film made from polyethylene terephthalate , which is also used to make clear drink bottles			1
each would cost about 50 pence each to manufacture			0
the fluorescent dyes allow the patterns , which are invisible to the naked eye , to be authenticated under an optical microscope and could add another layer of complexity if a number of different colours are used			0
the researchers believe the fingerprints could also be tagged with a unique @entity115 or barcode , which could facilitate a quick search in a database and ease the process of authentication or counterfeit identification			1
the experts claim the cost of generating a minute counterfeit pattern of wires would be higher than value of most products being protected by them			0
the wires are grown in a solution and coated with silica and fluorescent dyes before being inserted into a plastic film made from polyethylene terephthalate , which is also used to make clear drink bottles ( pictured ) professor @entity76 said : ‘ once a pattern is tagged and stored on a database using a unique @entity115 , a certain substrate , whether this is a bank note or a credit card , could be authenticated almost immediately by observing the fluorescence images and comparing it with stored images			1
‘ these authentication processes can be automated by employing an algorithm that recognises the positions and colours of the silver nanowires and digitizes that information in a database			2
such information could significantly reduce the size of the stored data and reduce the time required for the authentication process			0
’ according to the @entity152 , around six per cent of global traded goods are counterfeit which the researchers believe could be reduced by using their technique to authenticate goods			0
‘ compared to other anti-counterfeit methods , the fingerprints are cheap and simple to produce , they are extremely difficult to replicate and can be authenticated very straightforwardly , ’ professor @entity76 added .			0

researchers from the @entity77 created anti-counterfeiting prints as small as *10microns* wide
they are made from tiny nanowires that the scientists claim will stump even the most determined of forgers
the unique patterns contain between 20 and 30 of silver strips that are scattered onto a thin , plastic film
the fingerprints could also be used to tag electronics and drugs
