the tweet , from the company 's official @ @entity3 account , showed a picture of two @entity17 - @entity16 drummers with a person in a gorilla mask in between them and asked : ' which drummer is not like the others ?

@entity29 and @entity30 , among others , reported on the tweet			0
outrage : the offending tweet ( left ) set of a firestorm , but @entity3 's apology was a copy - paste job @entity3 said friday that it has fired the person and outside agency that was responsible for the tweet , but did not disclose their names or offer a sincere apology on @entity43			1
' we have zero tolerance for anything so stupid and offensive , ' said @entity48 , spokesman for the @entity50 - based company			0

' home improvement behemoth : @entity3 stores like this one are visible throughout the @entity16 ' in a @entity43 world where everyone can see everything instantly i think you 'll see more rather than less of this because people tweet before they think , ' mr @entity53 said			1
adding insult to injury , the home improvement chain 's apology was n't even sincere , instead a copy - paste job to every person replying to the offending tweet			0
