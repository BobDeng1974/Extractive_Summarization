host commentator that 's it from @entity4 's live @entity3			2
thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions			2
until next time ! @entity8 : a lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay			1
if a club bid £ 90million for @entity15 or £ 65m for @entity16 ( bearing in mind he is 30 ) , i think @entity18 would consider it			1
ronaldo because it would make economic sense and @entity15 because it would not be unpopular with @entity18 supporters			1
they definitely wo n’t sell both ! and quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer , especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad			2
@entity8 : the better players were in playing the @entity32 and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at @entity35 from @entity36			1
there were away fans in the @entity41 vs @entity43 game – that is something that is always missing from a @entity32			1
@entity8 : fair assessment , yes			1
@entity16 was as motivated as i ’ve seen him recently			0
perhaps a week of talk about @entity48 being the greatest ever had contributed to that			0
he also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at @entity53 as soon as he got the ball			0
he took his goal well and was one of those @entity18 players who did n’t deserve to be on the losing side			1
@entity48 had a strange night			0
he seemed to be staying out on @entity60 ’s wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space			0
but @entity18 pressed so well he did n’t see a great deal of the ball			1
he certainly did n’t run the game as he did against @entity69			0
but i agree once @entity71 and @entity72 had faded in the second half he began to impose himself			0
@entity8 : it was the 42nd @entity32 he ’d played some part in – no @entity77 player has played in more			1
what he always contributed was calm			0
by @entity81 football standards @entity77 vs @entity18 games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space			1
he ’ll come back to this fixture as @entity77 manager one day , you can count on it			1
@entity8 : the most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying			1
so to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable			0
i do n’t mind the roll - over - ten - times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value , but the hand over the face when actually you ’ve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome			2
@entity8 : he was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before @entity16 equalised that made the game such a contest			1
he improved in the second half but i think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch			0
you have to give him some credit for that double - breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though			2
i do n’t think he ’s very happy for several reasons			0
firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the @entity123 final and the @entity125 final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club ’s supporters – he gets whistled in at the @entity129 if he puts one pass out of place and so - called ‘ fans ’ have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground ( it happened again in the early hours of this morning )			2
he is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out - and - out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year			2
click here to read the full story as angry @entity18 fan attacks @entity15 's car @entity8 : he wants to come back to @entity142 , no doubt about it			1
@entity145 would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first @entity147 and now @entity18			1
@entity149 would i ’m sure go with him back to his home city and @entity145 – who seem terrified that if they move @entity153 on they will stop qualifying for the @entity125 – would have a coach who has won the competition three times			2
it all sounds perfect , i do n’t know why the wheels have not already been set in motion ! @entity8 : in one sense he does n’t have to adapt that much because this @entity77 does not play like the old @entity162 , @entity77			1
we saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play			2
he has also come through the @entity169 school , and @entity170 ’ @entity41 do n’t exactly play like @entity172 ’s @entity171 so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him			2
it ’s more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping , and not ignoring his pal @entity48 when he is in a better position than him			0
@entity178 has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season			0
the greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like @entity187			0
he will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader ’s performance			0
@entity8 : no one stays in the job very long			1
they had 25 managers in the 25 years that sir @entity199 was at @entity200 and old habits die hard			0
it ’s incredible to think that @entity203 has n’t been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning ‘ @entity205 ’ but he has n’t and unless they win the league or the @entity125 this season there will be a change			1
@entity210 will almost definitely manage @entity18 one day			1
it could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge			0
@entity8 : @entity15 is at his best when he is given free reign going forward			1
last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four - man midfield as opposed to up - top in the three of a 4 - 3 - 3			1
he put a decent shift in but if he ’s working back he ca n’t also be on @entity223 ’s shoulder waiting to pull away			0
this is why i still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities			2
he also faded last night because the team did – @entity71 and @entity72 both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered			0
@entity8 : it ’s been a long time since i can remember seeing him dive			1
i think the @entity235 cured him of that			0
and he is also alongside @entity48 now , and @entity48 very rarely dives			0
but he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down i agree			0
look at it from his perspective though , he is up against @entity241 and @entity242 , both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes ; and @entity242 enjoys the dramatics too			0
so if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game			0
@entity8 : it was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single - minded as he was at @entity41			1
in the @entity235 he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal			0
at @entity77 he ’s got @entity256 on one side , @entity48 on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish			2
but @entity77 need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when @entity53 played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind			2
i ’m not sure he ’ll score as many goals as he did at @entity41 in one season – but he will score more important ones			0
