by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 got out of jail with a stoppage - minute equaliser to rescue an opening - day 2 - 2 draw against @entity6 in the @entity7			1
the home side had been the better side in the first half and deservedly led at the break through @entity12			1
but the second half was completely the opposite as @entity6 completely bossed proceedings			2
first class : @entity17 celebrates his first career goal but his side were denied a win late on two goals in the space of six minutes from @entity17 and @entity23 gave the visitors a lead they thoroughly merited			1
but a stoppage - time goal from @entity27 spared @entity2 's blushes - and ensured honours ended even			1
@entity6 could and probably should have been ahead from their very first attack			0
@entity32 dispossessed @entity33 and found @entity34 on the edge of the area			0
his shot was low and true but @entity38 pulled off a fine save , diving to his left			0
then , from @entity43 's resulting corner , @entity41 hit the near post with a header from point - blank range			0
with four players on debut it was always going to take @entity2 time to get going , but they found their way into the game and took the lead on 27 minutes			1
@entity2 : @entity38 , @entity54 , @entity33 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity58 ' 80 ) , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 - 72 ' ) , @entity27 , @entity12 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity57 - 64 ' )			1
subs : @entity61 , @entity65 , @entity57 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity69 - @entity68 goal : @entity12 , @entity27 @entity6 : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity23 , @entity73 , @entity17 , @entity41 , @entity74 , @entity43 , @entity56 ( @entity75 ' 60 ) , @entity34 , ( @entity76 ' 60 ) , @entity32			1
subs : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 goals : @entity17 , @entity23 referee : @entity85 ( @entity86 ) a lovely ball from the back from @entity33 found @entity12 , whose initial shot was parried by @entity71			1
the rebound fell to @entity63 , whose shot was half - blocked , the ball falling to @entity12 10 yards out			2
this time the winger made no mistake , clipping the ball over @entity71 for his first goal of the campaign			2
@entity12 had been @entity2 's best player in the opening half - hour , and the goal merely added to his confidence			1
the former @entity102 player wriggled away again down right , only for his cross to be cut out by a flailing @entity6 leg			0
@entity56 took on the shot from fully 35 yards and , although well - hit , the shot was always too high			0
@entity2 were just about good value for their half - time advantage - but the second period was all one - way traffic the other way			1
@entity41 evaded @entity56 and reached the byline , his pull - back finding @entity17 , whose shot from the edge of the area was deflected away			2
@entity72 then fired over the top , before @entity119 's effort was blocked			0
the ball fell to @entity41 , whose strike was way over the top			0
@entity6 made a double change on the hour mark , throwing on new boy @entity75 and @entity76 for @entity119 and @entity34 respectively			0
the switch nearly paid immediate dividends as @entity75 cut in from the left and forced @entity38 into another save to his right			0
@entity38 was again on hand moments later to keep out @entity41 's flick header from @entity43 's cross			0
the rebound fell to @entity76 20 yards from goal , but the curled effort was well wide of the far post			0
@entity2 were hanging on at this stage , and @entity43 's cross somehow evaded @entity32 sliding in at the far post but @entity6 finally broke through on 71 minutes when @entity74 found @entity17 , who drilled in from 25 yards			1
and after @entity41 hit the post with a curling effort , the @entity6 went in front with 13 minutes remaining			2
a clever free - kick from @entity76 found @entity73 unmarked at the far post , and he headed across for @entity23 to nod past @entity38			2
but @entity2 somehow picked themselves up off the canvas , resulting in @entity27 heading home past a disbelieving @entity71 four minutes into stoppage time .			1

@entity12 puts @entity2 in front during first half
@entity17 equalizes with his first ever goal
@entity23 smashes home winner six minutes later
@entity27 heads home in the third minute of stoppage time to level
