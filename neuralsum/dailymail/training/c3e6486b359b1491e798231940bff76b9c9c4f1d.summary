negotiators failed for a second time this year to resolve the 12 - year dispute over @entity4 's nuclear ambitions and have extended talks for another seven months			1
the five permanent members of the @entity7 and @entity8 have been locked in talks with @entity4 for months over concerns the country is developing nuclear weapons			1
they were seeking to turn an interim deal into a lasting accord , but the deadline expired today			0
after a frenetic six days of diplomacy in @entity18 , negotiators are now hoping to secure a general agreement by march and a final deal by june 30			1
@entity4 denies the charge , saying it is only interested peaceful nuclear programs like producing power			2
the country 's nuclear programme has been left frozen but intact , without any of the cuts sought by the @entity40			1
@entity42 foreign secretary @entity41 said the sides were giving themselves until march to agree on a text ' that sets out in layman 's language what we have agreed to do			1
' the five permanent members of the @entity7 and @entity8 have been locked in talks with @entity4 for months ( from left , @entity53 foreign minister @entity52 , @entity40 secretary of state @entity54 , former @entity56 foreign policy chief @entity55 , @entity42 foreign secretary @entity41 and @entity8 foreign minister @entity57 ) experts then will be given another four months to ' translate that into precise definitions of what will happen on the ground , ' he told reporters			1
@entity40 secretary of state @entity54 focused on praise , in an apparent attempt to maintain a relatively cordial atmosphere at the negotiating table			1
mr @entity54 , who arrived thursday and met repeatedly with @entity4 foreign minister @entity68 , said @entity68 ' worked diligently and approached these negotiations in good faith			1
' ' we 're serious ' : prime minister @entity72 has threatened the use of force against @entity4 several times since 2009 , and even sought authorization from his cabinet in 2011 ' we have made real and substantial progress and we have seen new ideas surface , ' he said			2
' today we are closer to a deal that will make the whole world , especially our allies in @entity23 and the @entity83 , safer			0
we would be fools to walk away			0
' mr @entity41 spoke of ' significant progress , ' while @entity8 foreign minister @entity57 said only differences about ' technical details ' remained			2
but the length of the extension suggested that both sides felt time was needed to overcome the disputes on how much @entity4 needed to restrict nuclear activities			0
' all the people involved here feel that there really is a chance to find out a way to each other and we are going to take that chance , ' mr @entity57 said			0
members of the new @entity102 - controlled @entity101 that will be sworn in in january have already threatened to impose additional sanctions on @entity4			0
it may well have enough votes to overturn an expected veto of such legislation by president @entity108			0
new sanctions could very well derail the talks , as @entity4 has signaled they would be a deal breaker , and @entity54 appealed to @entity101 to ' support ... this extension			2
' in @entity32 , hardliners fearful that their country could give away more than it gets under any final deal could increase pressure on @entity119 ayatollah @entity118 to break off talks			2
the talks extension , however , appears to have the approval of @entity118 , who is the ultimate arbiter in his country			0
protests : an @entity4 student holds a placard to show a support for @entity4 's nuclear program in a gathering in front of the headquarters of @entity4 's @entity133 in @entity32 , @entity4 , yesterday both sides are haggling over how many - and what kind - of centrifuges @entity4 should be allowed to have			1
the machines can enrich uranium from low , reactor - fuel level , up to grades used to build the core of a nuclear weapon , and their output grows according to how modern they are			0
@entity145 wants deeper and more lasting cuts in the program than @entity32 is willing to give			0
prime minister of israel @entity72 has threatened the use of force against @entity4 several times since 2009 and three years ago even asked his cabinet to authorise such a strike			0
@entity4 's nuclear effort has expanded significantly since			1
