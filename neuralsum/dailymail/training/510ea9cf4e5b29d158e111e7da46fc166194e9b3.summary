@entity0 goes off with head injury by @entity2 published : 06:52 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 04:09 est , 6 june 2013 i understand that the @entity4 split into two teams before monday 's training session			1
a 1st team to play the @entity8 on saturday , and a 2nd team to play the @entity10 today			2
read more here in our live text commentary of the game the last time the @entity10 won a @entity19 series , 16 years ago , a prolific @entity17 kicker was the heart of their success			0
at @entity24 , @entity23 watched at close quarters as his protege proved he is ready to emulate that feat. what @entity28 achieved in the course of this routine rout of modest opposition was simply staggering			1
by dispatching all 11 shots at goal — most of them from absurdly acute angles — he reduced the art he practises so diligently into a mere formality			2
that is also what he did to the question of who will start at full back in the test series			0
the 24 - year - old worked his magic in the shadow of his mentor , the former master of the art. @entity23 was at the heart of the @entity10 ’ triumph in @entity62 and he has passed on all his accumulated wisdom to another @entity64 with a deadly right foot			2
as kicking coach here , he will come on to the field with a tee , offer some water and a few choice words , then stand behind the kicker , as a reassuring presence			0
he is one of the men who provided the inspiration for @entity28 , when he would spend countless hours , day after day , year after year , practising in @entity76 with his grandfather			1
now the young @entity79 phenomenon is living up to those he once looked up to			0
‘ you watch the likes of @entity23 , @entity84 and @entity85 , and you want to be like them , ’ said the @entity81 15			0
he is certainly fulfilling that target			0
but there is more to it — a specific desire within him to seize this chance after 2009 , when he joined the tour late , played one game against the @entity95 , and had to return home injured			2
power runner : @entity98 no 8 @entity99 in bulldozing form for the @entity10 leading by example : @entity102 was a key link man kicking masterclass : full back @entity28 ‘ ever since i was on the plane back from @entity62 , i have been dreaming of this moment , of pulling on a @entity10 jersey again , ’ said @entity28 , in the aftermath of his masterclass			1
... but the @entity10 scored more points than the @entity110 cricket team , who were skittled for just 65 by @entity112 in a @entity114 warm - up			1
click here for the match report ‘ i got the opportunity tonight and it was a pretty special feeling			0
i think that ’s up there with the best i ’ve kicked , there ’s no doubt about that			2
i ’ve had some games where i ’ve managed a few but nowhere near as many as that			2
‘ to kick all 11 was incredible from a personal point of view			2
‘ i suppose some days you just find that sweet spot early on			0
i felt it could be one of those days , but i came off the pitch not knowing how many i ’d kicked because i try and stay focused			2
i ’m so pleased with how it went			0
‘ the pressure is a real privilege			0
to be kicking for @entity133 was a dream of mine , never mind kicking for the @entity10			0
i never thought i would be doing it , and i ’m enjoying every second of it			0
i always enjoyed goal - kicking as a kid and i ’ve tried to work hard at it			2
trapped : @entity141 has nowhere to go after he is grappled by rival scrum - half @entity142 @entity144 hit : @entity145 takes on @entity146 eye - catching : @entity147 ( right ) ‘ i have a picture in my head of how i want each kick to go			1
i always try to hit the middle of the goal and there ’s a lot of work that goes in with @entity23 and the other kickers			0
‘ i do what works for me and i was pleased with how it went			0
’ while @entity28 described himself as a proud man , the same could be said of @entity23 , who told his compatriot on monday that he would be the kicker , ahead of @entity98 fly - half @entity161			1
the man who delivered 24 of the points in this thrashing of the feeble @entity4 was glad to have his mentor on hand , adding : ‘ i certainly notice he ’s there			0
i ca n’t think of a better guy to have bringing on the tee for me and to have alongside me in games and in training			0
i ’m lucky to have @entity173 around			0
’ @entity175 selector : @entity98 wing @entity176 tries to play his way into the test team with some pacy runs down and out : @entity181 is treated for a leg injury during the tour match job done : @entity10 coach @entity185 while the goal - kicking was supreme , the fact that there were so many conversions to line up stemmed from the @entity10 ’ ability to tear through the opposition defence at will , particularly after half - time			1
@entity99 delivered a rampaging display of ball - carrying class to show he has raised his game again at just the right time after a mid-season slump			1
and he was matched in the gain - line busting and off - loading stakes by his @entity200 and @entity98 team - mate , flanker @entity199			1
both men did enough to challenge the prevailing view that the @entity19 back row will be all - welsh			0
celebration : @entity206 and @entity102 celebrate after the convincing win behind a less - than - dominant scrum , @entity161 showed the variety of his playmaking repertoire with delayed inside passes and cross-kicks proving especially effective			1
the giant frames of @entity145 and @entity206 understandably caught the eye of home coach @entity215 , with the latter playing a key part in a superbly drilled routine instigated by @entity161 and finished by @entity219 , for the captain ’s second try			1
@entity161 himself scored the first , while @entity0 , @entity99 , @entity223 , @entity175 , @entity224 and @entity225 all touched down as the @entity10 cut loose			1
so many of these @entity10 and others made strong , initial test cases , but the strongest of all came from @entity28			1
‘ hopefully , if i ’m selected , i can step up to the plate like that against @entity231 , ’ he said			1
barring injury , he will be selected and on this evidence , the @entity231 should be very afraid			1
on the charge : @entity145 ( top ) takes on @entity236 double delight : @entity102 scored two tries			1

prop @entity181 carried off injured on a *stretcher* with ankle knock and is then cited for alleged bite on @entity142
captain @entity102 scored two tries
@entity161 , @entity0 , @entity99 , @entity245 , @entity175 , @entity224 and @entity225 also went over
@entity28 kicked nine conversions and two *penalties* from 11 attempts
@entity251 sin - *binned* in 71st minute
@entity0 goes off with head injury
lions scored more points than @entity231 's cricket team ( 65 all out ) managed runs in one - day defeat by @entity112
