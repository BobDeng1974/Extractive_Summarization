@entity0 could die out in just a few years scientists are debating whether to intervene by @entity2 published : 09:57 est , 16 march 2012 updated : 09:59 est , 16 march 2012 gray wolves are at grave risk of extinction in a @entity8 national park , scientists have warned , with just nine of the animals left and their numbers likely to dwindle			1
@entity12 ’s gray wolves are at their lowest ebb in more than half a century , and could die out within just a few years			1
only one of the nine wolves still wandering the wilderness island chain in western @entity17 is known to be female , raising doubts that the animals will bounce back from a recent free - fall			1
diminishing numbers : a pack of gray wolves in @entity12 in northern @entity8 they are at grave risk of extinction unless people lend a hand , wildlife biologist @entity24 and @entity25 from @entity26 have warned in a report			1
the dramatic drop in numbers seems to have been caused by a run of bad luck , rather than one single catastrophe			1
a shortage of females has cut the birth rate , while a breakdown of several packs has boosted inbreeding and weakened the gene pool			1
other troubles include disease and starvation from a drop - off of moose , the wolves ’ main source of food			1
although wolf sightings are rare , their presence is treasured by park visitors who hope to catch a glimpse on a backcountry trail or hear their eerie howls at night			2
beautiful habitat : just nine gray wolves still live in the @entity12 ‘ people like to know the wolves are there , ’ said mr @entity24			2
‘ it could be argued that this is the wolf 's greatest refuge in the world			2
it 's the only place they 've never been killed by human beings			2
’ because @entity12 is a federal wilderness area , hunting and trapping are prohibited			2
unless the wolves rebound quickly , the @entity74 will face the difficult question of whether to intervene			1
officials could either bring in wolves from the mainland to salvage the existing population or let nature take its course and start with a new group if the wolves do die out			1
some scientists prefer not to interfere with nature , even if it has serious consequences			1
mr @entity24 and mr @entity25 would prefer to let nature take its course and airlift in more wolves should the current inhabitants become extinct , in order to prevent moose from running rampant and damaging the ecosystem			2
otherwise , ‘ we 'd be taking a vital wilderness and turning it into an overstocked barnyard , ’ mr @entity24 said			0
prey : the gray wolves have traditionally kept the moose population in the park under control they added that while some believe it unethical for humans to manipulate wildlife populations in wilderness areas , @entity12 ’s environment has already been considerable modified			0
the primary consideration , they contend , should be protecting the ecosystem , for which wolves are essential as they keep the moose population in check			0
the wolves ' best hope may be that the female will bear a healthy litter of pups next month and help form a new pack , @entity24 said			0
another positive sign : moose numbers rose from an estimated 515 last year to about 750			0
but a shortage remains of elderly moose that are easiest for wolves to kill			0
prospects are increasingly remote that more wolves will find their way to @entity12 without help , mr @entity25 said			0
a male is believed to have made the crossing on an ice bridge in the late 1990s and sired offspring , temporarily reinvigorating the gene pool			0
but a study published last week found that @entity141 ice cover has declined 71 per cent over the past 40 years			1
biologist began observing interactions between the gray wolves and moose in 1958 , beginning what became the world ’s longest - running study of predators and prey in a single ecosystem , mr @entity25 explained			0
restoring wolves would enable continuation of the study , which has yielded a wealth of discoveries about both species , he said			0
@entity157 , a wolf expert with the @entity159 , advocated a hands - off policy unless the wolves die out			1
even in their diminished state , they could last a decade or more and may pull a surprise comeback , he said			0
‘ this is a really unique opportunity to see what they can do , ’ mr @entity157 said			0
‘ if there 's any intervention , it destroys that potential			0
