@entity0 , who produced the figures , says cutting the rate further would produce another surge in revenue helping to ease the deficit the amount of tax paid by the best - off has soared since @entity9 slashed the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p , according to a new analysis			1
new figures from @entity14 show the total income tax collected on earnings over £ 150,000 has shot up from £ 40 billion last year to £ 49 billion this year			1
former conservative cabinet minister @entity0 , who produced the figures , said it appeared the chancellor ’s tax cut was having dramatic results in what would be a ‘ shock to many of the conventional pundits ’ who criticised the measure			1
he said the boost in income tax take suggested the chancellor should go further , and make the 45p rate ‘ more competitive ’			2
‘ total income tax collected from people earning more than £ 150,000 has surged from £ 40bn to £ 49bn this year compared to last			2
' it has more than made up for the loss of tax revenue from lower earners following the big increase in tax thresholds , ’ mr @entity0 said			2
he said the 50p rate introduced by @entity41 in its final weeks in power was clearly ‘ costly ’			1
@entity43 lost high earners overseas , and saw the richest use tax loopholes to declare less income when the rate was high			2
‘ the rareified group of people earning more than £ 2m declared income of £ 12.2bn in 2012 - 13 , but paid tax on £ 26bn of income the following year with the lower rate			1
‘ this small group of people alone more than paid for the rise in threshold to take many lower earners out of tax altogether			0
‘ the top one per cent of earners now earn 13 per cent of the income but pay 28 per cent of the total income tax			2
the top five per cent earn one quarter of the income but pay around half the total income tax			0
‘ this progressive structure works as long as the government does not get too greedy , setting a higher rate which means the rich pay less because they either go or they earn and declare less			0
‘ i wonder how much more revenue the @entity73 would enjoy if the top rate were set at a more competitive rate ? ' i suspect that too would see a further surge in revenue , money the state clearly needs to end the deficit			1
’ @entity9 cut the 50p top rate of tax to 45p in his 2012 budget , saying it raised ' next to nothing ' a @entity87 spokesman said : ‘ the government is clear that in clearing up @entity41 ’s economic mess those with broadest shoulders should bear the biggest burden			1
’ @entity92 will today hail the government ’s tax changes taking effect this week as the most radical for two decades			0
on tuesday , corporation tax came down to 21 per cent , the tax - free annual investment allowance for businesses was doubled , business rates were capped at two per cent and fuel duty was frozen			0
from sunday , over one million businesses will benefit from up to £ 2,000 ‘ cashback ’ on their national insurance contributions			0
the prime minister is to visit three businesses who are announcing a combined total of nearly 10,000 new jobs , including @entity109 , which is taking on 500 new employees ; @entity111 , which is extending its runway leading to 4,000 jobs in the airport and an additional 4,000 jobs in the supply chain ; and @entity117 is taking on an extra 1,400 staff			0
mr @entity92 said : ‘ a key part of our long - term economic plan is to create jobs and to cut taxes			0
so i am delighted that in the week where we are cutting tax for 26 million hard - working people – and now taking three million out of tax altogether – i can announce nearly 10,000 more jobs which will give people financial security for the future			0
’ the personal income tax allowance will be raised this weekend from £ 9,440 to £ 10,000 , cutting tax for the typical basic rate taxpayer by £ 705 this year .			1
