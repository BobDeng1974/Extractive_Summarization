by @entity0 virtual reality may seem like a niche activity reserved for gamers , but its potential is also proving worthwhile in the battlefield			2
the @entity6 is trialling a system that uses the @entity9 headset to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch			1
cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset , creating the illusion that the tank is ‘ transparent			1
’ the @entity6 is trialling a system that uses the @entity9 headset to drive armoured vehicles , pictured			1
soldiers can wear the headset , and use it drive the tank , above or below the hatch and it has been designed to protect them from gunfire and remove driving blindspots the @entity28 has created a system called @entity30 , short for @entity31			1
it works by digitally altering images from a camera mounted onto a submarine so the driver can see above the surface without a periscope			1
this protects submarines from revealing their position			0
the system can compensate for visual distortions caused by waves moving through the water 's surface by using the position of the sun at a set time			0
the rays shine though underwater pinhole array onto a glass image plane			0
the successful tests were recently carried out in @entity55 , @entity56 and were filmed by @entity57			0
when a driver looks left , they see footage from the left camera , and vice versa on the right - achieving a 360 - degree view of the road			1
by lowering their gaze and looking down towards the vehicle belts , the driver can also use the system to parallel park ' with a precision of up to a centimetre ' , without the assistance of the vehicle commander			1
the system means soldiers can remain below the hatch and protected from gunfire for as long as possible , and means commanders can spend more time analysing the situation and potential risks , rather than guiding the driver through the terrain			1
it also removes the blind spots that occur when driving large vehicles			0
@entity87 - based firm making view developed the system with assistance from the @entity6 ‘ s @entity90 cameras mounted on the vehicle , pictured , film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset , creating the illusion the tank is ' transparent			1
' when a driver looks left , they see footage from the left camera , and vice versa			1
by lowering their gaze , they can parallel park with a precision of up to a centimetre the tests are conducted using commercial equipment , which is expected to be released for general deployment in @entity56 armoured vehicles in the near future			2
@entity56 's @entity113 said the system could be operational in five years ' time the augmented reality software used in the @entity117 is designed by @entity118 in @entity119			1
this software also lets drivers see various other elements plotted on the visor such as weapons and minefields in the field or enemy troops , similar to how they appear on video games			2
major @entity129 at @entity113 told @entity57 : ‘ this is a very promising concept			2
‘ normally you are more or less blind because there is armour all around you			2
with this system you can see just as well as if you were seeing out the hatch			0

this software also lets drivers see various other elements plotted on the visor such as weapons , minefields , or enemy troops ' it ’s more strenuous for eyes since it ’s a synthetic picture , so it will be used when you think you could be shot at			0

@entity113 told @entity57 the system could even be operational in five years ’ time			0
‘ i can foresee that the system will be technologically mature in maybe two to three years			0
then we will need a qualification period for the equipment to be ready for use in traffic			0
' so maybe it will be ready in five years , ’ continued @entity164 .			0

cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings
this live footage is fed to the driver through the @entity9 headset
when a driver looks left , they looks through the left camera , and vice versa
this creates the *effect* that the armoured tank is ‘ transparent ’
it means soldiers can remain below the hatch and protected from gunfire
