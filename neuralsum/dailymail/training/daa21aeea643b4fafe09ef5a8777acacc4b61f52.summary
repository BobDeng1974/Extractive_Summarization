@entity1 tried to stop a senior @entity3 diplomat linked to a paedophile scandal being named despite knowing of his ' unnatural ' behaviour , it was claimed today			1
a secret file prepared for the then prime minister revealed that sir @entity8 had been engaged in ‘ sexual perversion ’ for decades and was vulnerable to blackmail by foreign powers			1
fears of a cover - up of @entity15 paedophile abuse intensified last night as the file which has remained secret for 35 years was published showing the extent to which mrs @entity1 knew about the behaviour of @entity8			1
the file detailing official investigations into the top diplomat , who was named in @entity22 as a paedophile by mp @entity24 in 1983 , shows how @entity8 had been engaging in ‘ sexual perversion ’ as far back as 1966 and possibly even earlier			1
briefing : a secret file prepared for @entity1 when she was prime minister had revealed that paedophile sir @entity8 had been engaged in ‘ sexual perversion ’ for decades and was vulnerable to blackmail briefing : @entity33 documents released today show how civil servants @entity36 member @entity8 had a cache of obscene material but he was unlikely to be prosecuted a secret file prepared for @entity1 ( right ) revealed that sir @entity8 ( left ) had been engaged in ‘ sexual perversion ’ for decades and was vulnerable to blackmail by foreign powers yet the depraved mandarin continued to enjoy a glittering career with his final posting being high commissioner to @entity47			1
the @entity48 reports that at one point , mrs @entity1 amended part of the memo in such a way that it indicated that she did not believe @entity8 should be named anywhere			1
the memo , in a reference to @entity8 , said : ' it is the policy of the law officers that persons who have been investigated by the police but not prosecuted should not be named in the @entity60 ] , as to do so is to cast an unnecessary slur on the person without his having the opportunity to clear his name before a court			2
' the @entity48 says that at this point , mrs @entity1 had crossed out ' in the @entity60 ' - suggesting she did not believe the diplomat should be named			1
the @entity70 and @entity71 - educated former @entity69 officer who died in 1992 , was a home and @entity74 mandarin , working closely with the intelligence services at the height of the @entity77 occupying the post of minister in @entity79 from 1964 to 1966			2
he was only exposed in october 1980 when @entity80 linked @entity8 with the activities of @entity36 ( @entity36 ) which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children			2
documents : papers kept secret until they were released to the @entity89 today show reveal mrs @entity1 was fully aware of the allegation aimed at @entity8 file : @entity8 was let off with a caution because the @entity93 deemed the paedophile material sent through the post by sir @entity8 and his friends had not been ‘ unsolicited ’ a secret file detailing official investigations into @entity8 publicly released by the @entity89 shows how the article sent @entity102 officials into a frenzied panic , amid fears that @entity8 ’s ‘ sexual perversion ’ made him vulnerable to blackmail from enemy states			1
there was also concern that his security vetting never revealed his depraved fantasies about children , which were referred to as a ‘ character defect ’			2
the newly released private papers were prepared for the then prime minister @entity1 ( pictured ) in october 1980 the @entity80 revelations stemmed from the discovery of a package addressed to a mr @entity117 – a pseudonym used by @entity8 – at @entity8 ’s @entity119 flat , that was left on a @entity121 bus			1
a police raid on the flat in 1978 uncovered a huge trove of pornographic materials and letters from members of the @entity36			0
among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which sir @entity8 had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies , the latter including sex with minors			1
there was also substantial correspondence with other @entity36 members in which they shared their otherwise secret desires and other graphic paedophile material			2
a total of seven men - including @entity8 - and two women were named as ‘ possible defendants ’ in the report submitted by @entity147 to the @entity93			2
one of the accused was carrying correspondence by a tenth unnamed person who had an ‘ obsession about the systematic killing by sexual torture of young people and children ’			0
however , sir @entity8 was not prosecuted , leading to claims that his offences were covered up due to his diplomatic role and alleged connections with @entity160			1
he was let off with a caution as the @entity93 deemed that as the paedophile material sent through the post by sir @entity8 and his friends had not been ‘ unsolicited ’ nor traded for profit , no offence had taken place worthy of prosecution			1
but the newly released private papers prepared for the then prime minister @entity1 in october 1980 reveal that astonishingly no one in the @entity33 , the @entity74 nor the @entity170 knew about the 1978 investigation until the article was published			1
@entity1 was so concerned about the affair that she wrote to the attorney general saying : ‘ so that there shall be no doubt , i leave it to your judgement whether or not you are interviewed on radio or tv about the @entity8 matter			1
’ papers prepared for her in 1980 show that : ‘ the police report showed that sir @entity8 kept explicit and detailed records of his sexual activities and fantasies and that he was a member of the @entity36			1
‘ but the only activities which could be shown to have occurred were with consenting adults			0
‘ the material in the records relating to children appeared all to be fantasy			0
’ according to minutes by sir @entity195 , then secretary of the cabinet : ‘ he ( @entity8 ) had access to highly confidential and sensitive material			2
’ the files show how sir @entity8 ( pictured with wife @entity201 ) had been engaging in ‘ sexual perversion ’ as far back as 1966 and possibly even earlier but the report went on : ‘ he has been , to all appearances , a health normal and happily married man			1
’ it said : ‘ it is clear that sir @entity8 was already engaging in sexual perversion in 1966 when he returned from @entity79 to the @entity74 and it must be presumed that he was doing so before that time			1
‘ he would of course have been especially vulnerable in @entity79			0
‘ while sir @entity8 was high commissioner in @entity212 there was a problem of obscene correspondence addressed to a fictitious female name at the @entity216 , apparently as a result of advertisements placed in a pornographic magazine			1
‘ at the time this was laid at the door of a member of the domestic staff , the latest report raises the question whether it should have been laid at sir @entity8 ’ s door			1
’ it went on : ‘ there must clearly be a full investigation , with a view to discovering whether anything more is known or suspected about sir @entity8 ’ s activities while he was serving in the @entity235 and whether there is any reason to suppose that security was compromised			1
new allegations have recently surfaced from an alleged victim named @entity241 who claims @entity8 abused him at @entity242 ( pictured ) ‘ this investigation is being undertaken by the @entity244			2
’ the @entity170 interviewed 14 @entity74 officials who identified two incidents during his period in @entity248 from 1959 - 1960 and his time in @entity212 between 1971 and 1974 as being a concern , although colleagues ‘ had no cause to suspect that he might be engaged in irregular sexual activities ’			2
‘ one of these will relate to his time in @entity79 when he would have been particularly vulnerable if he had been involved in these activities , ’ the report said			0
‘ nothing has so far come to light from interviews which have been conducted to suggest @entity8 ’s vulnerability to blackmail came to the attention of hostile intelligence services at the time			2
’ the review later concluded that there had been no ‘ prejudice to security ’			0
however , questions are sure to be asked about how rigorous the police and security services investigation was into his sordid past as new allegations have recently surfaced from an alleged victim named @entity241 who claims @entity8 abused him at @entity242			2
the file is likely to be of significant interest to campaigners pushing for justice for the victims of historic sex abuse , and may be considered by the current child sex abuse inquiry commissioned by home secretary @entity283			0
the paper had remained hidden for 35 years and was only discovered by chance by an academic who stumbled upon the document title while researching secret @entity1 files at the @entity89 in @entity289			1
but the @entity33 decided to publish its contents			0
@entity291 , a @entity292 mp who has campaigned on the issue , said : ‘ all of these files that have been classified need to be opened up			0
‘ this one is of great importance			0
’ diplomat sir @entity8 , a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile , was named by mp @entity24 in 1981 using parliamentary privilege			1
the new document , revealed today by @entity300 , was written about the same period			0
@entity8 was member ‘ 330 ’ of the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children			2
he rented a flat at 95 @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity121 under the name of @entity117 to store @entity36 literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles			0
but sir @entity8 made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a @entity121 bus			1
it was addressed to mr @entity117 at @entity319 in @entity320 afterwards , in november 1978 , police raided the @entity319 flat			0
what they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography			0
among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which sir @entity8 had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies , the latter including sex with minors			1
even the hardened police of the @entity336 were ‘ revolted ’ by the @entity306 haul			0
he sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined			0
and yet he was n't			0
much to the anger and disbelief of the @entity336 he was only given a caution			0
he died in 1992 aged 77			0
@entity24 also said that an unnamed senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from @entity344			0
the mp claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children			0
he said at the time : ' i 'm concerned about the cover - up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised			0
he is a security risk ' .			0
