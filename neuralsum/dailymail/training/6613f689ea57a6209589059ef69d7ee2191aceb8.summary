by @entity0 the question for the owners of @entity3 is how long will they allow themselves , and their club , to be made to look ridiculous ? it is no longer that @entity3 are bad			1
that could be said of any struggling club in any league in any sport			0
there are a lot of bad teams about , every year			0
what is happening at @entity3 is bad cubed			2
maybe bad to the power of 10			2
beyond bad , in fact			0
there is playing lousy football and going for 11 goals in the space of four days			2
there is poor form and there is conceding 22 goals over six matches			2
therefore @entity26 and @entity27 look ridiculous , too			0
in the meantime , how far becomes too far ? how long will the two @entity50 , as they are known , have to suffer scorelines that are personally and professionally embarrassing before they act ? the owners promised a different team , a better team , after the january transfer window but increasingly that appears empty rhetoric			0
@entity3 thought they had @entity59 reserve @entity57 — who has started only two games , both in the @entity61 , this season — earlier in the january transfer window , but were rebuffed			1
they thought he had a better offer from a @entity45 club , but were wrong there , too			0
he simply did n’t want to sign for @entity3 — and he wo n’t be the last			2
it is surely not insignificant that only @entity67 , late of twice - relegated @entity68 and an unsuccessful loan spell at @entity70 , has rallied to the cause so far			0
@entity3 ’s disastrous run is making them the least attractive proposition in the @entity45			2
at this stage last season , @entity74 attracted @entity78 ’s striker @entity77			0
such a signing could save @entity3 ’s season , but could the club hope to pull it off now ? what player of the necessary quality would join a club who lost 5 - 0 to @entity87 with the reserves and then 6 - 0 to @entity34 with the first team ? do n’t be ridiculous			1
so he is a lucky man , @entity28			0
much like @entity92 ’s cricket coach @entity91 , he has contrived to collect the plaudits for his management nous in the good times , yet avoided the taint of overwhelming failure in this leanest of years			0
thumping : @entity3 have shipped 11 goals in two games after losing to @entity87 5 - 0 on sunday @entity100 up : one young supporter was captured by @entity103 cameras in floods of tears at the @entity106 flower is the man for this crisis , we hear after @entity92 ’s 5 - 0 ashes whitewash in @entity112 , which rather ignores that , for such a top - drawer motivator and manager , he entirely failed to anticipate it or reverse the nosedive once it came			1
he makes great play of his ‘ @entity120 ’ alter ego when results go well , but this present crash is being met with the regular recital of an injury list that , while debilitating , does not represent sufficient mitigation for an almost complete defensive collapse			0
looking bleak : @entity3 were thumped again as @entity28 's injury - hit side were beaten 6 - 0 at the @entity129 unstoppable ? @entity130 fires @entity34 's sixth goal home in the @entity61 semi-final first leg in vain : @entity28 bellows at his players from the bench during the thrashing on wednesday evening ' at @entity34 , it was almost as if @entity3 accepted their fate with a collective shrug			1
with full backs and emergency loanees in the team , what else is there to do but lose 6 - 0 ? quite a lot actually			1
' @entity28 juxtaposed his free - transfer full back @entity148 having to play in the centre against @entity33 and @entity130 on wednesday night and reeled off the injuries to @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 as justification for such a feeble display			0
yet @entity3 have conceded three goals or more on 10 occasions this season — and in six of those games @entity28 has had two of his front - line centre halves available			1
@entity152 and @entity151 played against @entity59 on september 21 ( lost 3 - 2 ) , @entity151 and @entity153 against @entity34 on october 19 ( lost 3 - 1 ) and @entity152 and @entity153 faced @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 , conceding a total of 13 goals as a partnership in those four games			1
injuries have taken @entity3 ’s defensive frailty to dismal new levels , but no @entity45 team have received such regular batterings this season			1
@entity176 have conceded three or more goals on eight occasions ; @entity179 on five , @entity180 three			2
@entity3 , remember , 10			1
in addition to this , it is worth remembering that @entity163 won a @entity185 final against @entity186 with @entity187 at centre half			0
is n’t that what coaches are supposed to do : re-organise , react or , at least , limit the damage ? at @entity34 , it was almost as if @entity3 accepted their fate with a collective shrug			1
with full backs and emergency loanees in the team , what else is there to do but lose 6 - 0 ? quite a lot actually			1
man for a crisis ? @entity92 cricket head coach ( right ) is under fire after a woeful @entity205 return hope ? @entity3 's record signing @entity206 is nearing fitness again , pictured in training on thursday waiting game : @entity206 's lengthy layoff has seen the east - @entity213 club struggle for goals keeping the tie alive would have been a start			1
it is hardly edifying for the club to have to adjust ticket prices for the return leg in a forlorn attempt to attract an audience for what should have been one of the most in - demand and eagerly anticipated matches at @entity226 in recent memory			1
they can not even sell the game on the presence of world - class opposition			0
what sort of team will @entity34 field on the night ? the reserves , with a few first - team players on the bench just in case a couple of early goals go in ? that is a tactic that might have served @entity28 better at @entity87 last weekend , when youth followed inexperience into battle , like a bad @entity246 re-enactment			1
one that got away : @entity57 ( left ) turned down a move to @entity3 , who signed @entity67 instead coup : this time last season , @entity74 landed @entity77 ( left ) , but @entity3 's chances of a marquee signing to bolster their survival bid look bleaker with every heavy defeat as embarrassment piles on humiliation for the owners — who have twice broken @entity3 ’s transfer record on @entity28 ’s behalf — removing the manager is no guarantee of survival			1
yet neither is keeping him any more			0
the motivation for maintaining the status quo would appear to be financial — @entity28 ’s pay - off is believed to be above £ 4million — coupled with a perceived shortage of replacements			0
yet the same logic saw @entity3 sleepwalk over a cliff under @entity272 in 2011			1
big freeze : @entity274 and @entity275 step out of a cryogenic chamber in the wake of the @entity34 defeat ice man : @entity275 still manages to pose for a photo while inside the -135c chamber back then , as the void appeared before them , @entity3 ’s directors skipped a match at @entity34 , which ended in a 2 - 1 defeat			1
had they attended they would have witnessed the moment when a sudden gust of wind in the tunnel scattered @entity272 ’s notes , which he comically struggled to retrieve			2
‘ like something out of a @entity294 film , ’ said a passing cineaste			0
and , yes , it was a ridiculous sight ; but it was never more ridiculous than this			0
sleepwalking to disaster : keeping @entity272 as manager cost the club dearly in 2011			2

@entity3 paid the price in 2011 when they *refused* to *axe* @entity272
after a heavy defeat by @entity87 , @entity3 were thumped 6 - 0 in @entity61 semi-final first leg by @entity34
hammers have conceded three or more goals 10 times this season
@entity312 - @entity213 side may struggle to attract big - name signings this month
