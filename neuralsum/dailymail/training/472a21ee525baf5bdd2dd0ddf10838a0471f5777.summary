by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 13 june 2013 anxiety : stress can cause a permanent genetic change to men 's sperm and even alter how their offspring 's brains develop stress can cause permanent damage to a man 's sperm and even stunt his children 's brain development , a new study has found			1
researchers have discovered that suffering anxiety or depression as an adult , teenager or even as a child could cause a lasting genetic change in a man 's sperm			2
scientists conducting a study on mice found that sperm damage caused by stress leads to offspring developing a ' blunted reaction to stress ' - a trait associated with several mental disorders			1
researchers at the @entity33 say this is the first time a link has been found between stress - related diseases potentially being passed from a father to his children			1
previous studies have concentrated on how environmental challenges - such as diet , drug abuse , and chronic stress - felt by mothers during pregnancy can affect their offspring 's neurodevelopment and increase the risk of certain diseases			0
in this study , published in the @entity51 , male mice were exposed to six weeks of chronic stress , before breeding , either throughout puberty or only in adulthood			1
examples of stress include suddenly being moved to another cage , being exposed to predator odour , noise or a foreign object in their cage			0
male mice are ideal for such an experiment because they do not participate in offspring rearing , meaning any external factors outside of germ - cell formation are essentially eliminated			2
a team of researchers led by professor @entity71 found that stress among male mice prompted a genetic change in their sperm that re-programmed a part of their offspring ’s brain			1
they found that offspring from paternal stress groups displayed significantly blunted levels of the stress hormone corticosterone - in humans , it ’s cortisol - in response to stress			2
professor @entity71 said : ' it did n’t matter if dads were going through puberty or in adulthood when stressed before they mated			0
we ’ve shown here for the first time that stress can produce long - term changes to sperm that reprogram offspring brains			0
researchers at the @entity33 carried out a test on male mice - finding that their sperm underwent a genetic change after they were exposed to stress ' these findings suggest one way in which paternal - stress exposure may be linked to such neuropsychiatric diseases			1
' but researchers also point out that a reduced physiological stress response may reflect some evolutionary benefit passed on to offspring to ensure survival in what is expected to be a more stressful environment			0
professor @entity71 added : ' whether such diminished stress reactivity would be detrimental or beneficial to offspring likely depends on the environment into which they were born , as well as genetic background factors			0

@entity33 conducted study on male mice
researchers found exposing mice to stress caused genetic sperm change
this change caused their offspring to have a blunted reaction to stress
