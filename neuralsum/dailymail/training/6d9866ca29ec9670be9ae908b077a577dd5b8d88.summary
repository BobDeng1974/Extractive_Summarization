in a video released last week , a female white lion cub from @entity8 tests out her vocal cords with extremely cute results			1
the cub , who was born just over a week ago , wanders around her wooden box , looking somewhat bad - tempered and lets out roar after roar to express her displeasure			0
with her white coat and her tiny squeaking sounds , the cub is reminiscent of a bleating lamb			1
the tiny lion is yet to be named , but she is already making her presence known			2
she was born to @entity46 , a lioness who came to @entity8 from @entity50 's @entity49			2
weighing in at 2.8lb , the cub was displayed to the media for the first time last week			0
more convincing : another of @entity8 's white lionesses roars in a slightly more intimidating show of power miracle baby : white lions are unique to the @entity61 area of @entity50 and are not albinos but a genetic rarity white magic : this lion cub has the ability to make any heart melt the new - born is one of a rare subspecies of lion whose white coats are a mutation of the @entity74 subspecies of lion found in @entity50			1
according to the @entity77 , white lions were n't seen by @entity78 until 1938			0
there are only a few of the creatures still in existence , mostly in captivity , but since 2004 , three white lion prides have successfully been introduced to their endemic region in @entity50			1
