the @entity0 has become the latest organisation to claim that 2014 was the hottest on record			1
they say it was 0.27 ° c warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010 , and 0.63 ° c warmer than the 20th century average - without the help of an @entity7 weather event			1
and according to their data , ten of the hottest years on record have come since 1998			0
the @entity0 has released their data for 2014 ( shown )			2
they say it is the hottest year on record - 0.27 ° c above the average from 1981 to 2010 , and 0.63 ° c above the @entity14 average			1
the findings are especially notable because there was no @entity7 last year the @entity0 joins @entity17 and the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) in the @entity19 , and the @entity23 , as one of four major global temperature ' keepers ' to reveal 2014 was the hottest ever			1
all four make their readings separately to one another - and they have all individually come to the same conclusion that last year was the hottest since records began in the late 19th century			2
experts say the rate at which it is warming is alarmingly quick , and heavily suggests the emission of co2 by humans is causing manmade global warming			0
2014 ( +0.27 ° c ) 2			0
1998 ( +0.22 ° c ) 3 ( tie )			0
2013 , 2010 ( +0.20 ° c ) 5			0
2005 ( +0.17 ° c ) according to the @entity0 , the average temperature last year was 0.27 ° c warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010 , and 0.63 ° c warmer than the @entity14 average			1
and it is by far the hottest year in 120 years of keeping records			2
the findings also reveal there has been no warming slowdown in the past decade , despite claims to the contrary by skeptics			0
some believed there was a slowdown because of an abnormally extreme @entity7 weather effect in 1998 which was the second hottest year on record			1
as seen in the graph above , years after 1998 were seen to be cooler , leading some to suggest climate change had been slowing			0
however , this data shows that , although cooler than 1998 , the top ten hottest years on record all came in the last 16 years - showing there has been no climate slowdown			2
before 1998 , no year came close to approaching these top ten in temperature			0
various organisations are preparing to release data , or have already , which shows that 2014 was the hottest year on record across the globe			1
while some places , like the @entity19 , may have experienced a variation that caused some places to get very slightly colder , overall the global trend is a worrying increase , far faster than any natural phenomenon could cause			0
it heavily suggests humans are driving climate change through the emissions of @entity72			0
in december the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) released data from the majority of 2014 pointing to a record - setting year			1
data from the @entity23 agreed with the findings			2
@entity17 's own data is expected to confirm the findings , while the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) will also reveal on 16 january that 2014 was the hottest year ever			1
the @entity0 joins @entity17 and the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) in the @entity19 , and the @entity23 , as one of four major global temperature ' keepers ' to reveal 2014 was the hottest ever			1
it heavily suggests humans are causing manmade global warming here the variations in temperature around the world for the last year can be seen			0
although some regions like the @entity19 experienced a cooler year , overall the global temperature was found to be much higher on average than has ever been experienced before ' the warmth in 2014 is also notable for another reason : the absence of @entity7 , ' reported @entity95			1
' although @entity98 temperatures were high in 2014 , atmospheric conditions did not allow @entity7 to form			0
' @entity99 , a climate scientist at @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , added : ' it is surprising to have record heat in a year without strong @entity7			2
' he said it is a reminder that the @entity108 is heating up quickly			0
the findings by the @entity0 follow a release by the @entity111 's @entity73 in december that said 2014 was a record - setting year			1
@entity18 is set to release its findings on 16 january , which are expected to confirm the findings of the other organisations			0
according to the @entity23 last year was also the warmest in the @entity118 series , the longest running temperature record in the world , which stretches back to 1659 , recording temperatures in an area of central @entity123			2
@entity18 will release its data on 16 january , which is expected to agree with that by the @entity0 that 2014 was the hottest ever			1
hear can be seen their provisional data from 2014 up to october , although they said there was no realistic scenario where the temperatures in november and december would not make it the hottest year			1

the @entity0 has released their data for 2014
they say it is the hottest year on record - 0.27 ° c above the average from 1981 to 2010 , and 0.63 ° c above the 20th century average
findings are especially notable because there was no @entity7 last year
it is a clear indicator that @entity108 is warming unnaturally quick
@entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity23 have all made their own findings , *independently* reached , that 2014 is the hottest ever
