@entity0 has landed his second signing of the summer after @entity2 confirmed that midfielder @entity3 is heading for @entity4			1
@entity5 revealed how @entity2 had activated a £ 9.75million ( 12m euro ) escape clause in @entity9 's @entity8 contract by faxing a bid to the @entity12 club in the past 24 hours			1
the @entity14 side admitted on wednesday night that @entity2 made their move and that everything has been agreed for the transfer to go through			1
done : @entity2 have signed @entity8 midfielder @entity3 after activating his release clause signal of intent : manager @entity0 has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year sealed : @entity23 has already secured a £ 4m move from @entity25 this close season the @entity27 released a statement on their website on thursday morning that the deal had been done in principle subject to the completion of relevant documents			1
@entity8 's chief executive @entity34 told @entity14 paper @entity35 on wednesday that : ' up until yesterday , i would have said it was just rumours about @entity3			0
' but now i can confirm that we have received an official offer from @entity2 , and i expect a very quick conclusion to it			2
' @entity0 has been chasing the @entity43 under 21 international for a while and has been over to personally check on the player 's progress			1
the 20 - year - old is an energetic box - to - box midfielder and should provide the @entity27 with extra impetus in the middle of the park			1
@entity52 were also keen on can - pronounced ' @entity53 ' - but it was always his intention to move to the @entity56			1
the club hope to have a deal concluded within the week as they press ahead with plans for an assault on the @entity56 title			1
the player 's agent , @entity63 , is a familiar face around @entity4 after brokering a loan move with the club for @entity68 in 2012			2
@entity0 is keen to get his transfer business done early			2
@entity23 has already signed for £ 4million from @entity25 ahead of the @entity70 and they continue to pursue @entity72 midfielder @entity71			1
they came within a slip of winning the league last month and the belief is that if they can keep hold of @entity80 - who was linked with a move to @entity82 in the @entity84 press on wednesday morning - and supplement that with shrewd additions , they 'll be in a better position to challenge come august			2
can is one of the most versatile young players in the @entity12			1
having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at @entity91 , the @entity93 - born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age			2
after only four first - team appearances at @entity91 , though , @entity9 's star faded during the 2012/13 season , and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to @entity8			2
it has done him a world of good , and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club			0
he has also represented @entity43 at every level from under 15 to under 21			1
can prefers to play in central midfield - ' either attacking or defending , i do n't care either way ' - but has been employed as a centre - back and a left - back on various occasions			0
as captain of the @entity14 under 17s team , he was the calming influence at the heart of play			0
his physical strength is of particular use going forward , though he is rarely overly reckless			0
it has been remarked on several occasions that can seems to have a maturity beyond his years , and his technical ability as a playmaker , either from the back or the front , is now beyond doubt			0
the most commonly drawn comparison is @entity128			0
and not only because the young @entity3 puts as much effort into his hairstye as @entity128 once did			0
his ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield , his dangerous shot , and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established @entity91 star			0
for those watching his marauding runs through the centre at @entity8 this season though , @entity140 has always also sprung to mind			0
it is little surprise that these two @entity91 stars have had an influence on can 's play			0
he has trained with them , or at least in close proximity to them , for several of his formative years			0

the 20 - year - old is an energetic box - to - box midfielder
