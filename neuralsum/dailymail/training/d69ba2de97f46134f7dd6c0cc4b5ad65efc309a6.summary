' that was unbelievable and it 's hard not to get carried away but i had to keep my focus and i think that 's the difference between being at a championship level and not , ' he said			0
' just keep my focus and take that energy off the crowd into the ring			0
' as for who he would like to face next , the @entity46 added : ' it 's all about progression so whoever wants to come over to @entity7 , i 'll fight anybody			2
' his promoter @entity53 was taken aback by the reception @entity8 was given , but is keen to keep the pressure of his young charge 's shoulders			2
' he 's 23 years old			2
that 's the thing we have to look at in managing his career now , ' said @entity53			0
' people will want him to go , go , go , go but sometimes we 've just got to rein him in a little bit and make sure he progresses and learns his match properly , because with his position now and his ranking , he can move forward to the world level			0
there 's no rush to do so , the fans here will want him to progress and he will progress			0
' we 've got something major here			0
' @entity8 , roared on , said : ' ( i had to ) just keep my focus and take that energy off the crowd into the ring ' @entity8 secured the vacant @entity2 featherweight title in his home city @entity7 against @entity25 earlier , @entity82 got back to winning ways on his light - welterweight debut but was thoroughly unconvincing in a points decision victory over the lightly regarded @entity86			1
@entity82 had lost his last two fights and decided a move up to the 140lbs division would breathe fresh life into his career , but the @entity92 looked a pale shadow of the fighter that had won world titles in two weight classes			0
he dropped his opponent in the opening round but struggled to impose himself after a decent start and although he deserved his victory , a 79 - 71 scoreline will do little to quieten the doubters who believe the @entity105 fighter 's best days are behind him , despite recording his 37th win from 42 fights			1
the 31 - year - old , who lost his @entity110 lightweight title to @entity111 before suffering a surprise points decision defeat to @entity113 last time out , was fighting outside of @entity115 for the first time since november 2011			1
desperate to impress on his first foray into the light - welterweight division , @entity82 made a strong start and was by far the busier fighter in the opening round , landing a couple of crisp jabs before felling @entity86 with a hard right near the bell			0
@entity82 ( left ) got back to winning ways on his light - welterweight debut but was thoroughly unconvincing he continued to use his superior height and reach advantage to beat @entity86 to the punch although the @entity129 grew steadily stronger as the second round wore on			2
it was more of the same in the third as @entity82 found some success behind his jab but was also guilty of swinging wildly			0
the fighters were both looking to land a knockout shot and @entity86 had his best round in the fourth , landing a hard shot that drew gasps from the crowd , but from then on the bout descended into a cagey scrap , with neither fighter really asserting themselves in the closing rounds			0
@entity86 ( 17 - 2 - 1 , @entity145 ) was deducted a point in the seventh for leading with his head but it mattered little to the overall proceedings , with @entity82 doing enough to win the remaining rounds without landing any significant blows			0
@entity153 also bounced back from his world title defeat with a first - round stoppage against @entity156			1
the @entity158 fighter , who was beaten by @entity110 light - middleweight champion @entity159 earlier this year , floored his @entity161 opponent three times for a confidence - boosting victory			1
hot prospect @entity164 continued his rise up the ranks by claiming the 14th win of his professional career with a third - round tko of @entity170			1
@entity82 got a points decision victory over the lightly regarded @entity86 on saturday night in @entity7			2
