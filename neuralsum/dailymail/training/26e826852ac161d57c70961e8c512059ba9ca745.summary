by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 23 march 2012 it started like a plot from a @entity4 thriller			0
a convicted murderer is sprung from prison in an audacious daylight pick - up by a hijacked helicopter			1
but @entity11 @entity10 's bid for freedom ended like an @entity13 when he switched to a taxi			1
the 35 - year - old – halfway through a 24 - year term for murder and theft - was hoisted out of the maximum security penal colony by a rope ladder from under the guards ' noses			1
daring : guards tried firing at the hovering helicopter as @entity10 scrambles up the danging rope ladder his accomplices , a man and a woman , commandeered at gunpoint the @entity30 helicopter and forced the pilot to fly to the jail , in the village of @entity34 , in @entity35 , 300 miles north of @entity36 , and hover while their friend clambered aboard			1
guards fired a number of rounds at the helicopter as it flew away , but without managing to get a crippling shot on target , according to witnesses			0
the aircraft , which had been booked for a ‘ business delegation ’ , was later found abandoned by a road on the edge of @entity35			0
the pilot was discovered bound and gagged , several miles away			2
but then @entity10 's luck ran out			1
the hapless convict switched to a taxi which police say they ambushed not long after the daring jail - break , and only a short distance from the town on thursday			1
dangerous : convicted killer @entity10 was 12 years in to a 24 - year jail term in a tough high - security penal colony in the town of @entity34 , 300 - miles north of @entity36 his two accomplices are still on the run			1
there have been several successful chopper escapes in @entity63 in recent years including an incident in @entity65 in 2009			0
@entity65 police were left scouring the country for two convicts who orchestrated a brazen helicopter prison break for the second time in three years			0
@entity70 , a bank robber who is among @entity65 's most notorious convicts , and @entity73 , 34 , were picked up by a helicopter that flew over the courtyard of @entity77 ' @entity76 in february 2009			0
the two had escaped the exact same way from the same prison in june 2006 , and had been due to appear in court monday in connection with that escape			0
three men were also freed from a @entity86 jail , in 2009 , in similar style			2
the convicted armed robbers including one of the most violent men in @entity63 , escaped when a hijacked helicopter flew into a jail near @entity93			1
it hoisted repeated offenders @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 had @entity99			0
despite their notorious reputations they were not being held in the prison ’s high security compound , which is surrounded by netting to confound airborne escape attempts			2
instead the chopper swooped over watch towers and high fencing before coming down in the prison yard			0
armed guards were so astonished that not a shot was fired , or anything done to stop the men jumping aboard .			2

pilot forced at gunpoint to hover over maximum security jail while convicted killer , 35 , *climbs* aboard
freedom bid cut short when @entity10 switches to a taxi
