this is the criminal family at the centre of a huge ' cash for crash ' fraud which led to drivers in the county paying £ 100 extra for their car insurance			1
police and fraud investigators uncovered the scam while monitoring the @entity13 family , from @entity14 , as part of an investigation into organised crime in @entity18			1
sixty people have now been convicted for their part in the fraud which involved hundreds of faked , fictitious or exaggerated crashes			1
@entity13 , left , is said to be head of the family and faked four crashes in just 10 months			1
@entity25 , right , was jailed for 30 months for his part in the scam @entity28 , left , and @entity29 , right , are among 60 people convicted for their part in the fraud @entity32 , left , was jailed for nine months while @entity33 , right , is awaiting sentencing for running an auto shop where he made false claims for storing damaged cars and hiring out replacements they include seven members of the @entity13 family , including head of the clan @entity13			1
the 49 - year - old was jailed for four years after a trial at @entity44 last year			0
a joint operation , codenamed @entity46 , between @entity18 police and the @entity48 focused on 1,800 accidents handled by two particular firms			1
they quickly identified 261 as appearing suspicious			1
investigators suspected some were entirely fictitious , some staged and some vastly exaggerated			0
they identified 25 accidents which were considered to have the highest impact on the public , both financially and in terms of suspected organised crime involvement , and these were selected for detailed investigation			1
those 25 accidents alone resulted in more than £ 514,000 being obtained for the claimants			1
a series of trials involving 70 defendants began last year at @entity44 , with 60 people convicted or pleading guilty to being involved			2
@entity65 was jailed for two years for his part in the fraud judge @entity68 today lifted an order which prevented the media from reporting any of the proceedings			2
key players included 40 - year - old @entity33 , known as @entity73 , who ran @entity74 , a recovery , storage and vehicle hire business			0
he is yet to be sentenced for his part in the scam which involved making false claims for storing damaged cars and hiring out replacement vehicles at up to £ 200 a day			2
also involved was his older brother @entity83 , 49 , who was jailed for four years after a trial last year			0
a police source described @entity13 as the head of the family , and he was found to have had four fake crashes within just 10 months			1
another family member bought an @entity90 with 112,000 miles on the clock , staged an accident in it near his home in @entity14 , and when he made a claim after apparently writing it off , its mileage had dropped to 37,000 , making it much more valuable			1
the claimant also falsely claimed to have suffered whiplash , the source said			2
investigators used a forensic engineer to prove another crash between a lorry and a car in @entity14 could not have happened as was fraudulently claimed			1
' we did n't just come across this activity			0
it was as a result of our communities telling us that organised crime groups were making their lives difficult , ' said chief supt @entity112			0
' we acted on their information and used intelligence - led policing to take appropriate action as part of a larger operation against organised crime			0
' this fraud is affecting every honest law - abiding car insurance holder			2
it 's not just a local issue			0
we believe this to be a nationwide issue which needs to be tackled robustly			0
' in @entity128 car insurance premiums have increased well in excess of the national average , with motorists typically paying an extra £ 100 a year			2
police and fraud investigators identified 261 suspicious accidents handled by two firms ( file photo ) ' this is an area with limited employment opportunities where many people have to travel out of the area to find work			1
' they need their cars , yet they are hit with higher than average car insurance premiums			0
this is how criminal activity has a real impact on the well - being of a community			0
' @entity150 , director of the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , said : ' this was part of a major joint investigation by @entity153 and the @entity48 into an organised scam which could have cost the insurance industry millions of pounds			0
' convictions send a clear message - insurance fraud is not a victimless crime , and the industry , police and justice system will vigorously pursue convictions against those involved			1
' insurance fraud , particularly the ' crash for cash ' phenomenon , is anti-social			2
the criminal gangs organising these scams use the proceeds of insurance fraud to fund other forms of serious crime			0
by locking the perpetrators up , we minimise genuine threats to our society			0
