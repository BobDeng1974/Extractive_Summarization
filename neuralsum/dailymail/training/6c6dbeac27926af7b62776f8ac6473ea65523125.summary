by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 17:18 est , 29 july 2013 a 12 - year - old girl is fighting for her life in critical condition after contracting a rare and extremely deadly brain - eating amoeba while swimming at an @entity6 water park			1
@entity7 is the second person to have come down with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in three years after swimming in the sandy - bottom lake at @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity6			1
only two people in the world are known to have survived the extremely rare @entity15 infection since the @entity16 began tracking it in 1962			1
@entity7 's family is praying for her to be the third survivor			1
tragic : @entity7 , 12 , is in critical condition after contracting a rare amoebic meningitis after she swam in a lake at a water park last week hope : only two people in the world have survived amoebic meningitis and her friends and family members are praying that @entity7 will be the third @entity7 's mother @entity28 has had t - shirts made for @entity7 's family and friends with a large , bold number ' 3 ' beneath the word 's ' @entity33			1
' ' this is @entity36			0
number three stands for the third person who will survive this amoeba disease			2
my daughter @entity7 , ' she told @entity43			2
' we are just going to take baby steps , but other than that , she 's doing remarkable			0
she 's a little miracle , ' the condition is caused when the @entity15 parasite enters a patient 's brain , usually after accidentally inhaling stagnant , warm water up the nose while swimming			1
@entity6 @entity55 spokesman @entity54 told @entity56 the water must to be forcefully , almost violently , pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water , being dunked or using a water slide			2
@entity15 are be found in nearly every freshwater body of water - even lakes			2
but , they only become active when water heats up			0
the cruel irony of the parasite is that the risk is highest when the temperature is hottest - and swimmers are looking for a reprieve from the heat			0
@entity7 's mother says her condition at @entity75 is improving and the family remains hopeful she will recover - despite the astronomically slim odds closed : the owners of @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity6 , have shut down the lake after learning of two reported cases of the deadly disease in three years primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific			1
it is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim 's brains - usually when infected water shoots of their noses			1
the amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive			0
it grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm , stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees			0
the water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans			0
health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the @entity107 in the last 50 years			0
only one person has survived in the @entity107			0
one other survivor was found in @entity110 health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by : the @entity16 says there have been 128 cases of the disease in the @entity107 in the last five decades - making the disease extremely rare , when compared to the number of lakes and muddy swimming holes @entity107 dip into for refuge from the summer heat each year			1
the amoebas are most active when the water temperature reaches about 85 degrees , @entity54 said			0
however , this is the second time the parasite has infected a swimmer at @entity10			2
in august 2010 , 7 - year - old @entity128 died after contracting the disease after he had been swimming at the lake			1
because two cases have been seen from the same body was water , state health officials asked the park owners to close their swimming hole			2
' though the odds of contracting @entity15 are extremely low , they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to swim , ' owners @entity137 and @entity138 said in a statement			2
the park , which attracts up to 250 swimmers a day - and thousands over the course of a summer - is now looking into installing a hard pool bottom at the swimming hole and filling it with chlorinated water supplied by @entity11			1
@entity7 's mother @entity151 said she had no idea about the risks of swimming in warm lakes and had never heard of the disease			1
' you 're a mom , you 're a dad			0
you can still take your child swimming			0
we do n't want to scare people			0
we just want you to know there are little things you can do to help them out			0
so they can go and still be a kid , ' she said			0
she encourages parents to make their children wear nose plugs while swimming - to minimize the risk of inhaling water through the nose and contracting the @entity15 parasite			1
still , @entity54 , of the health department , says that swimmers really should n't be too concerned about the the @entity107 has recorded just 128 cases of naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years another tragedy : @entity128 , 7 , died of the disease in 2010 after swimming at the @entity10 - where little @entity7 is believed to have been infected			1

@entity7 , 12 , contracted primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after swimming at @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity6
disease is caused by inhaling water infected with the @entity15 amoeba
one two people in the world are known to have survived the disease . her family is praying she will be number three
she remains in critical condition at the *hospital*
@entity7 's disease is the second case to come from the water park
in 2010 , 7 - year - old @entity128 died from amoebic meningitis after swimming in the same lake
