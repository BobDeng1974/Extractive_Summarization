by @entity0 the queen is famous for her love of horses and so are @entity4 and @entity5			0
but it seems they are n't the only royals with a passion for all things equine			0
@entity11 , a keen rider in her own right , was among the racing aficionados to turn out for the first race of the day at @entity15 - and even had a runner			1
unfortunately for the royal , her horse , @entity18 , failed to make the grade and could only manage a third place finish in the @entity22 , well behind the winner , @entity24			1
enjoying the day : a casually dressed @entity11 chats to jockey @entity25 ahead of the first race staying ahead in the style stakes : the @entity11 teamed her tweed suit with chic patent boots despite the disappointing result , the @entity11 appeared on good form as she enjoyed the sunshine and a chat with co-owner , the @entity36 , and @entity18 's jockey @entity25			1
the day out at the races is a break from what has been a very busy schedule for the @entity41 and @entity11 , with more engagements to follow next week			1
next week will see the royal couple tour @entity44 , with visits to the @entity46 and @entity47 in @entity48 pencilled in			0
the following day , the couple are scheduled to visit a number of historic churches in @entity52 , before the @entity11 continues on alone to a local packaging factory			1
briefing : the @entity11 and the @entity36 talk tactics with jockey , @entity25 runner up : @entity18 , pictured right , took third place behind the eventual winner @entity24 , centre all smiles : a well wrapped up @entity11 appeared to be enjoying her day out in the sunshine passion for horses : although not as committed as the @entity65 , @entity11 is also a horsewoman for now , and with the @entity67 break to look forward to , the @entity11 appeared relaxed and happy as she watched the races in the bright @entity70 sunshine			1
and although she did n't quite manage to take home the trophy , she did at least fare better than the @entity65 , who last week saw her filly @entity76 trot into a lowly seventh place in the @entity78 at @entity79			2
the monarch could n't conceal a grimace as she watched her horse , who had been introduced to president @entity85 of @entity86 the day before , slope across the finish line			2
the @entity65 's career as a racehorse owner spans more than 60 years and began with the handful she inherited on the death of her father @entity92			0
like her father and grandfather before her , the @entity65 's horses race in purple and scarlet silks enlivened with gold braiding			2
during her long association with racing , the @entity65 has triumphed in more than 1600 races and has won every one of the @entity103 classics , with the exception of the @entity105			0
last year , @entity106 , a filly owned by the @entity65 , romped home to take the prestigious @entity109 at @entity110 - much to the delight of the monarch			0
while @entity11 regularly appears in the carriage alongside the @entity65 at @entity110 , she , unlike her mother - in - law , is yet to win a race there			2
thrilled : @entity117 jumps for joy after riding @entity119 to victory in the @entity122 @entity121 close call : @entity117 's @entity119 ( left ) narrowly squeaks past @entity124 on @entity125			0

the @entity11 co-owns a *bay* *thoroughbred* colt named @entity18
@entity18 finished the @entity22 at @entity15 in third place
@entity11 and @entity18 's co-owner , the @entity36 , both watched race
despite the result , both appeared to enjoy the day and *glorious* sunshine
