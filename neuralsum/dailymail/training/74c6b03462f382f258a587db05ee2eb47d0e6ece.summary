by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:01 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:01 est , 21 december 2013 @entity3 has been challenged by @entity4 to ' come clean ' about his links to the lobbyist @entity3 last night faced being dragged into a damaging ‘ lunches for lobbyists ’ scandal over a £ 400 million property scheme			1
the prime minister was challenged by @entity4 to ‘ come clean ’ about his links to @entity13 , the lobbyist at the centre of the row over plans for a massive rail freight terminal			1
no 10 has already been accused of a ‘ whitewash ’ after cabinet minister @entity19 was last week cleared of wrongdoing over a private lunch with mr @entity13 – at which the development on a former airfield in @entity24 was allegedly discussed			2
but @entity4 last night switched the attack on to mr @entity3 ’s own links with the lobbyist , a @entity29 member of the @entity31 council that covers the prime minister ’s @entity33 constituency , and has been pictured with him on election leaflets			1
@entity4 claimed mr @entity13 was a ‘ close friend ’ of mr @entity3 and demanded to know if the two men had ever discussed the rail depot project first proposed in 2006 , which is still awaiting approval from ministers			1
shadow cabinet office minister @entity40 said the prime minister must answer a series of questions over his relationship with mr @entity13 , chief lobbyist for rail depot developers @entity46			1
that included whether he had been invited to @entity48 by mr @entity3 and how many times the prime minister had met him without officials present since 2010			2
cabinet secretary sir @entity52 last week rejected a complaint from @entity55 @entity29 mp @entity54 over ms @entity19 lunching with mr @entity13 in 2011 when she was a transport minister			2
after the lunch , mr @entity13 reportedly emailed asking her to ‘ press the case for a speedy and supportive decision ’			0
sir @entity52 insisted ms @entity19 , now the @entity61 , took no action as a result of the lunch which she described as a ‘ personal engagement with a long - standing friend ’			0

last week cabinet minister @entity19 ( right ) was cleared of wrongdoing over a private lunch with the lobbyist but mr @entity40 said mr @entity3 should not have referred the complaint to the cabinet secretary – given his personal links with mr @entity13			1
the @entity4 frontbencher said : ‘ he should have passed it outside the remit of @entity48 to the independent adviser on ministers ’ interests			0
’ last night , mrs @entity83 – who has branded sir @entity52 ’s inquiry a ‘ whitewash ’ – declined to comment on the prime minister ’s links with mr @entity13			1
but the local mp , a fierce opponent of the plan to build five warehouses with railway sidings on the @entity24 greenbelt , revealed she had resubmitted her complaint about ms @entity19			0
in a letter to the cabinet secretary , she accused him of seemingly not even considering the ministerial code requiring ministers to ‘ ensure that no conflict arises , or could reasonably be perceived to arise , between their public duties and their private interests ’			0
mrs @entity54 added : ‘ many of my constituents believe ms @entity19 ’s actions directly point to a conflict of interest , so there is at least the perception of a conflict			0
