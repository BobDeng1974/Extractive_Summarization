by dr @entity0 last week it emerged that 14 women a year die in @entity3 as a result of taking certain contraceptive pills			1
for the million - odd @entity8 women on them , it was worrying news			1
responding to this data , the medicines watchdog the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) has urged all gps to consider very carefully a woman 's risk of blood clots before prescribing the contraceptive			1
the @entity19 comes in many different forms and it is the third - generation pills such as @entity21 and @entity22 that are deemed higher - risk and more likely to cause a blood clot			1
third - generation pills such as @entity21 and @entity22 are deemed higher - risk and more likely to cause a blood clot the medicines contain man - made versions of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone , and taking these in pill form suppresses a woman 's natural menstrual cycle			1
but the oestrogen also increase the chance of developing a clot ; the specific type of oestrogen in the third - generation pills has been shown to convey double this risk			1
q. i 've been on the @entity19 for years and vaguely remember the gp who prescribed it mentioning side effects - now i read there are deadly risks			2
should i stop taking it ? @entity48 this data concerns the @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity49			1
the risks are increased on these but still remain very small in absolute terms for individuals			0
do not stop taking the @entity19 - the @entity13 has advised this is not necessary			1
speak to your doctor again about the risks , and if there are any concerns you should be switched to a different type or a different contraceptive altogether			2
the women died from blood clots , which means either complications from a dvt or a stroke			2
these are known but uncommon consequences of being on the @entity19			0
what this @entity3 data highlights is that we have to convey these risks to patients and ensure women who are high - risk are not on these pills			1
q. who should n't be on the @entity19 ? @entity48 there are certain absolute no - nos for the @entity19 , for example any woman known to have a clotting disorder , or hormonally driven illnesses such as migraine with aura or breast cancer			2
for other risks such as weight , smoking or high blood pressure , it is more of a grey area and the @entity40 and the patient weigh up those risks versus the benefits			0
for example , in a woman with a @entity98 over 30 , the risks of a clot are higher but the advantages are thought to outweigh those risks			2
in these types of scenarios , the discussion with the patient is paramount , especially as there are alternative contraceptives			0
there are certain absolute no - nos for the @entity19 , for example any woman known to have a clotting disorder a. at the outset you have a check - up usually three months after the @entity19 is initiated			2
after that you should be monitored at between six and 12 monthly appointments			0
the @entity40 should be checking your blood pressure , asking you about side effects and making sure you are taking the medicine correctly			0
they should also be checking to make sure you have not developed new risk factors			0
for instance , if a sibling developed a spontaneous blood clot , this increases your own likelihood of developing one on the @entity19			0
i do know some women decline their checks as they think they 're fine , but in my practice we would n't issue the pill to them			0
@entity137 what other kinds of side effects should i be watching out for ? @entity138 are generally very well tolerated but they can cause weight gain , nausea , breast tenderness , mood swings and erratic bleeding			0
this usually settles down in the first few months , but if it does n't there are many different types available and women tend to find one that will suit them			0
q. can i just stop - or do i need to gradually reduce my dose ? a. if you are advised to stop , this would normally be done at the end of the month or cycle so as not to cause any disruption with your bleeding pattern			0
if you are suddenly deemed to be very high - risk , you can stop taking the pill immediately : this would have no significant adverse effect			1
q. what are the alternatives ? @entity48 as well as the commonly prescribed contraceptive pills , there are also low - dose pills that contain less oestrogen as well as @entity170 ( or progesterone - only @entity19 ) which contain no oestrogen			1
there are a whole range of @entity175 options known as @entity176 - the long - acting reversible contraceptives that have the advantage of not relying on remembering to take a @entity19 , and no oestrogen , so no clot risk			1
these include the implant , the contraceptive injection and coils .			0
