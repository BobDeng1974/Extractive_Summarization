now bankrupt , the 40 - year - old has even taken up cage fighting in an attempt to scrape some money together			1
bemoaning his downfall , he said of his wife , @entity19 : ‘ when we married i was captain of @entity4 , good looking , plenty of money , not a care in the world			1
now she is married to a fat old guy , not good looking any more , and no money			1
’ @entity3 gave up cricket and returned to @entity6 , where he was born , to go into business in 2004			1
but last year he was declared bankrupt , and this week he appeared in court to confirm how much money is owed to each of his 40 creditors			1
in an interview with the @entity35 after his court appearance , he said : ‘ those who grumble about losing some of their money have lost nothing against what i lost , which is everything			1
‘ but you know , there is one thing that no one can take away from me			2
and that is the love of my wife @entity19 and my three beautiful kids			2
that along with my health			2
health and a wife ’s love are far more precious than money			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity56 fighting does n’t pay all that well			2
it hurts , physically , at times , but i have n’t got my head knocked off yet			2
‘ but boy , do they love to boo me when i go into the ring			2
i ’m a traitor to the @entity6 , after all , having been born here and then ending up in the @entity65 playing cricket for @entity4			1
i ’m less popular than the taxman			0
’ @entity3 captained @entity68 between 1997 and 2003 , winning three @entity69 , and led the @entity4 team in one - day internationals			1
he also represented his country in test matches			0
his brother @entity74 , also a cricketer , died in a car accident in 2002			0

in the ring : @entity3 has taken part in cage fighting in an attempt to scrape from money together , but say it hurts physically and does n't pay that well @entity3 had doubled his money on a house sale in 1994 and believed he could do it again			1
‘ i was a genius – or so i thought , ’ he said			0
the venture soon turned sour			2
from living a life of luxury , with more than one home on each side of the @entity6 continent , he and his family now own no property and are renting			2
@entity3 said : ‘ the lawyers representing the creditors in court yesterday wanted to know where every cent had gone and it was not a pleasant experience			1
they wanted to know everything about my life , almost down to how many times i went to the toilet			0
’ love : @entity3 , pictured with his wife @entity19 in 2001			1
he has said his wife 's love is far more precious than money during an interview with the @entity35 since his bankruptcy , he said , attempts had been made ‘ by enemies ’ to paint him as a criminal , but he insisted : ‘ i ’m no crook			2
my life is an open book			0
’ he opened his wallet and added : ‘ this is all i have left – just a few dollars			0
yet there have been claims that i ’ve ripped people off , run away with their money , got it all tucked away , secretly loaded myself up			2
‘ the truth is , i ’ve been left with nothing			0
nothing , that is , except the devotion of my wife , @entity19 , and the love of my kids			0
’ he said he was a victim of the global financial crisis , adding : ‘ what happened was mostly out of my hands , although i accept that i did not apply the same professionalism in my business affairs as i did in my cricket			0
’ he now admits that he made a ‘ massive error ’			0
his firm was liquidated in september 2010			0
among his creditors is former @entity4 and @entity68 teammate @entity141 , whose claim is estimated to be more than £ 400,000			1
‘ @entity141 understands the position i got myself into , as do the other creditors , apart from one who is determined to stamp me into the ground , ’ @entity3 said			1
‘ there was another man i went into business with when i managed to get a tv show up and running on @entity151 here in @entity6			0
‘ things did n’t go well between us – he ended up alienating my friends and business associates			0
finally he tried to remove my wife as a director			0
i had to take him to court to put him back in his box			0
‘ but even though the court found in my favour and removed him from the directorship he in his anger accused me of stealing money			2
’ @entity3 showed the @entity35 a copy of a police search warrant which he said suggested he had indeed stolen cash			1
‘ why else would the police want to draw up a search warrant ? ’ he said			0
heyday : @entity3 practices his bowling for an @entity4 match in @entity6 during 2002			1
he representing the country in both test matches and one day internationals royal meeting : @entity3 is given the county championship trophy by the @entity178 after his county @entity68 's victory in 2002 ‘ however , there is one problem with this document			1
it was n’t signed , never executed			0
it was printed up as a result of a complaint by one of those working against me and of course the police had to get things rolling , but it did n’t get anywhere			0
’ @entity3 ’s determination to fight the damage to his reputation was not helped when it was revealed that he had tried to leave the country without the permission of his bankruptcy trustee , and had been stopped by @entity199			1
‘ in fact , i had no idea i was n’t allowed to leave after being declared bankrupt , ’ he said			0
‘ i was actually on my way to @entity203 to do some charity work , but when it was pointed out to me that travel was not allowed without explicit permission i realised i had made an innocent error			0
’ he added : ‘ in two years i ’ll be free of bankruptcy and the first thing i plan to do is to shake the hands of people who have lost money through my property ventures			1
‘ i am trying to establish whether i am legally entitled to try to pay them back after i have been dismissed from bankruptcy but either way i feel very badly about what has happened and i hope that i can clear the air with those creditors one way or the other			0
