by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 foreign policy chief @entity2 gave controversial @entity5 opposition leader @entity4 a warm embrace yesterday , as she promised the country help in fighting its financial crisis			1
the first senior foreign official to visit @entity5 ’s capital @entity10 since president @entity12 was overthrown , @entity2 urged @entity13 to allow its neighbour to move forward ‘ in the way it chooses ’			2
‘ we are here to say we want to support and help the country to stay strong and to go forward in the way it chooses to , ’ she said			2
embrace : @entity2 hugged former president @entity4 after pledging to support @entity5 ‘ we also think it is very important to send a strong message about the territorial integrity , and the unity and the independence of @entity5			1
’ @entity2 said @entity5 needed ‘ short - term help and long - term investment ’ , but any @entity28 involvement in a £ 19billion bailout has been described as ‘ completely unacceptable ’ by @entity30			1
the meeting came on another day of dramatic developments which saw @entity12 still on the run , his former chief of staff – and one of the few believed to know where he is – shot and wounded , and elite police officers suspected of shooting at protesters forced to beg for forgiveness from their colleagues			0
amid extraordinary scenes in the city of @entity48 , the officers were greeted with chants of ‘ @entity50 ! ’ and ‘ @entity52 ! ’ but claimed they had not killed or beaten people themselves			0
so far , only @entity12 has been charged with crimes against humanity after the killing by security forces of 82 protesters in @entity10 , but there were claims yesterday that secret documents linked a senior @entity62 intelligence figure to an operation to wipe out protest leaders			0
if true , the papers could be hugely damaging to @entity13 , allegedly showing two secret operations to target protesters called ‘ @entity68 ’ and ‘ wave ’			0
she said the country needs long - term investment and @entity13 ' must let it go forward in the way it chooses ' her words come as claims emerge that @entity62 intelligence documents vow to wipe out protest leaders @entity5 ’s parliament yesterday called on the @entity81 to prosecute the deposed leader and his henchmen over the ‘ mass murder ’ of protesters			1
interim president @entity86 also warned of ‘ very dangerous signs of separatism ’ in several regions , and was last night locked in meetings with his security services on how to prevent the country splitting in two – with half favouring ties with the @entity3 , half with @entity13			0
significantly , an online petition calling on @entity97 president @entity96 to invade eastern @entity5 was dramatically deleted last night after going viral on the @entity97 - language web			1
a map linked to the petition showed how @entity5 would look if @entity62 annexed its eastern regions , creating a separate country or super-region called ‘ @entity13 ’			1
in less than 24 hours , almost 100,000 had expressed support for dividing the country			2
@entity97 prime minister @entity106 said authorities in @entity5 had taken power as a result of ‘ armed mutiny ’			2
yesterday @entity97 military units denied reports that they had been involved in an operation to smuggle @entity12 to @entity62			0
the search for the @entity96 ally was further confused when chief of staff @entity116 , one of the last men known to have been with him , was shot twice in the leg .			0
