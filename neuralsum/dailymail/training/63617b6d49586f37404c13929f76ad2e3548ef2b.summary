by @entity0 published : 12:55 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 15:24 est , 30 august 2013 absence , as the saying goes , makes the heart grow fonder			2
and apparently it makes the face more attractive , too			2
for despite having kept an uncharacteristically low profile since leaving the @entity8 judging panel in 2011 , @entity6 has been voted the celebrity most women want to look like			1
she has the most desirable eyes , hair , cheekbones and skin tone , according to a recent survey			2
and according to clinical psychologist dr @entity17 it is because she has been absent from television screens , while @entity19 , who is rarely far from the media spotlight , was among the stars women least want to copy			1
@entity6 seen here modelling for @entity24 , has been voted the celebrity most women want to look like dr @entity26 said : ' if we see something all the time we also get bored with it , no matter how fascinating it is			1
' so it 's actually a really wise trick to not be in the spotlight all the time			2
being slightly inaccessible is endearing and attractive			2
' @entity6 , who rose to fame after winning @entity36 : the rivals in 2002 , was once named the sexiest woman in the world by @entity40			1
in this latest survey almost a quarter of women asked said they would like to have her thick auburn hair and large dark eyes			2
11 per cent said they wished they had her golden skin tone and 10 per cent were keen to copy her nose			2
miss @entity6 , whose recent hiatus from the television might have pushed her out of people 's minds , was one of 15 @entity59 and @entity60 female celebrities survey recipients were presented with			1
they were asked by beauty brand @entity63 to select their favourite features from stars ranging from @entity67 , to @entity19 , to @entity68			1
mrs @entity19 did n't appear in the top three for any feature			1
other celebrities did , however , including @entity72 for her hair , @entity74 for her cheekbones , and @entity76 for her skin tone			0
according to psychologists it is because the pop star has been away from our tv screens , and absence makes the heart grow fonder when it comes to admiring style but the only feature @entity67 was beaten on was her mouth			1
the survey found that @entity60 actress @entity68 's smile is more popular			0
explaining the psychology behind why miss @entity6 's features are attractive , dr @entity26 said : ' when it comes to attractiveness what we are looking for is someone who is not quite symmetrical			1
perfect symmetry is boring , so you want it to be slightly off - beat			0
' also you are looking for some sign that that individual is interested in the world around them , and in particular about you			0
and that comes mainly in the eyes			0
eyes that are dark , or that have large pupils , show interest			0
' when we get interested in someone our pupils enlarge , we ca n't help it			0
and when we are interested in someone else they feel flattered so they think that you 're more attractive			0
over-exposure leads to boredom and @entity19 ( left ) was among the stars women least want to copy			1
@entity68 ( right ) was voted as having the best mouth , the only feature that @entity6 was beaten on she added : ' we 've been conditioned to think that darker skin is more beautiful because it 's associated with the ability to take a holiday and get a tan			1
' normally you would go for really glowing skin and good colour which shows good blood flow and so the tan thing is something we 've been conditioned to through advertising and things			0
' miss @entity6 , was married to footballer @entity138 for four years until 2010 , has undergone a glamorous make - over since breaking into the music industry 11 years ago			1
her hair has got fuller , her teeth whiter , and her skin a deeper shade of tan			0
but her smile has remained the same and dr @entity26 said that could be why she was beaten by @entity148 to top the best - mouth category			0
dr @entity26 said : ' with the smile , if you show your teeth a whole lot that usually is a sign of appeasement , you do n't feel quite confident			0
' if it 's a sort of gentle relaxed smile then that is very , very attractive because they 're saying we 're equals and i 'm really engaged in you			0
