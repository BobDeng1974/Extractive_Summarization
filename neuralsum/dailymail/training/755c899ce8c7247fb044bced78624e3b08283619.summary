by @entity0 a dying man ’s wish to see his wife and kids one final time came true thanks to the generosity and hard work of a hospice in @entity10			1
@entity11 , who is from @entity12 originally , left his family behind and came to the @entity14 , so he could earn money for his oldest daughter to go to nursing school			1
he worked as a maintenance man at a pair of hotels in @entity21 , @entity22 to earn enough money to put his daughters through college			2
last wishes : @entity11 's ( right ) dying wish was to see his wife and kids one more time			1
thanks to the generosity of @entity31 that wish has now come true			0
his wife @entity33 , and daughter @entity33 , 11 were flown in from @entity12 to see him @entity35 : n the past three weeks , @entity11 went from wanting to die to wanting desperately to live we are family : mrs. @entity39 and her daughters including 11 - year - old @entity33 ( pictured ) , girls arrived at @entity42 hospice in @entity10 on saturday night and have been there ever since however , the 43 - year - old is currently holed up at @entity44 at @entity45 because his heart is about to fail			1
he began to have heart problems in 2012 while living in @entity48			1
in december 2012 , he had to have heart surgery and he received a pacemaker			1
while in @entity21 , he traveled to @entity48 for checkups , but he never complained or let on that anything was wrong			0
one day in december , mr. @entity11 pulled his manager aside and asked for a ride to the hospital			1
his pacemaker had been jolting him as his heart function deteriorated			1
with his pacemaker barely working he wound up in the hospital , and then was moved to hospice when things got worse			1
he says he could n’t get up out of bed or even see			0
happy times : back in @entity12 , @entity39 is seen with his daughters , @entity33 , 11 , and @entity63 , 3			1
he moved to the @entity14 to earn money so they could have a better life back home and go to college together again : the family 's visit from @entity12 has revived mr. @entity11			1
once unable to stand up or talk without sacrificing too much energy , on sunday he was walking around , slow and weak , but improved what next ? mr @entity11 's mother - in - law lives in @entity48 , and plans are underway to transport him to a hospice there if he survives long enough at the present time , he needs a heart transplant to survive , which is unlikely			1
the staff asked him what they could do for him			1
' he said ‘ i miss my wife and kids so badly , ’ ' said @entity84 @entity83			0
his former employer , @entity85 , set up a computer in his hospice room and dialed his wife on @entity89			1
' @entity11 was so happy and he said , ' i 'd love to see them one more time before i die , ' mr. @entity85 said			0
emergency papers were prepared and visas were issued for mr @entity11 ’s wife @entity33 , his 11 - year - old daughter @entity33 and his 3 - year - old daughter @entity96			2
mr @entity11 ’s boss at the hotels in @entity21 , where he worked as a maintenance man , paid for the airfare			2
on saturday night , his family arrived to see him			2
he could barely believe it			0
' so , so , so beautiful , ' he said of the moment to @entity104			0
' i was there waiting and then when the moment came , i could n’t believe my eyes ! ' ' @entity108 : mr @entity11 's wife @entity33 was so happy to see him			0
she intends to stay by her husband 's side until the end emotional : mr @entity11 began to cry as he spoke about his family back home and how his one wish was to see them a final time sacrifice : mr. @entity11 came to the @entity14 from his native @entity12 for work and ended up in @entity118 in february 2013 , working as a maintenance man at a pair of hotels in @entity21			1
he did it to earn enough money to put his daughters through college he started to cry when his wife talked about what it meant to her , and how she felt alone so far away in @entity12			1
' she stayed by me			0
she has n’t left , ' he said			0
@entity134 , it seems , may be the best medicine			0
since he arrived , he ’s been walking , and he says his vision has improved			0
his will to live also appears to have strengthened			0
' i do n't have a medical explanation , ' said @entity140 , medical director at @entity42 , to the @entity141			0
' i 've been doing hospice medicine for six years and this is the second time i 've seen this , ' he said			2
' i do n’t want to die yet , because i have n’t fulfilled my promise to my daughter , ' said mr @entity11			0
' i do n't want to die and leave my kids			0
i want to live some more			0
i want to live 10 , 20 more years			0
' to survive , mr. @entity11 would need a heart transplant , and it does n't appear likely that it will happen			2
although mr. @entity85 has arranged for the family to stay at one of his other hotels in @entity152 , mrs. @entity39 said she 's not leaving her husband 's side			2
he ’s not well enough to fly , so he ’ll be driven to @entity48 to stay with his mother - in - law			2
again , his boss will pick up the tab			2
he is hoping to get a new @entity159 boss will pay for that as well , for which @entity11 is extremely grateful			1
he still hopes to get a new heart , but in the meantime having his family close by is enough to make his current one beat a little faster .			1

@entity167 , 43 , needs a new heart and is in a hospice in @entity10
he told staff his dying wish was to see his family again
his former boss and hospital staff managed to secure visas for his family to come and pay to fly them from @entity12
