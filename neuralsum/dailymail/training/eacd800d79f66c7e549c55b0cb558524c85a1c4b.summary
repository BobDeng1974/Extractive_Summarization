a coastal cafe is bringing back good manners just one coffee at a time			1
owners of @entity4 in @entity5 , on the @entity7 ' south coast , have put up a sign which is not only encouraging customers to be more polite , but it is putting a smile on their faces			1
for about two months , the sign which reads ' a coffee : $ 5 , a coffee please : $ 4.50 , good morning , a coffee please : $ 4 ' has been greeting coffee drinkers			1
cafe owners @entity17 and wife , @entity19 , own the @entity4 on the @entity7 south coast owner @entity17 said he and his wife , @entity19 , wanted to bring back good manners after one of their employees saw a similar sign elsewhere			1
' common courtesy is ... becoming less and less common , and we 're trying to bring it back , ' he told @entity29			1
' we are in service industry but we ’re not servants			0
we deserve as much respect as anyone else			0
' please and thank you go a long way			0
' mr @entity17 ( pictured here with chef @entity37 ) said he and his wife wanted to bring back common courtesy with the sign chef @entity37 said the sign 's purpose has been fulfilled , saying customers having been noticeably more polite to staff mr @entity17 - who has owned the kiosk with ms @entity19 for four years - said reactions to the sign had been good			1
' it gives people a smile and starts their day off , ' he said			2
' we have some people who try it on and say " please " , thank you " and " have a nice day " and then " can i have it [ coffee ] for three dollars ? "			2
' and the sign 's desired effect has been panning out			1
chef @entity37 said people were going out of their way to be nicer			2
' people have been saying keep the change and they 've been a lot nicer and we saw a change in the customers , ' she told @entity29			0
' people tended to come in and say " @entity68 " and there was no " hi , how are you ? " ' mr @entity17 and @entity19 have owned the kiosk for about four years , penning the sign about two months ago mr @entity17 said the sign was a gimmick and the kiosk did not enforce it but it put a smile on people 's faces but mr @entity17 said they did not go as far as enforcing the sign			1
' it ’s just put up there as a gimmick to cheer people up			2
we never enforce it , ' he said			0
' we could n't take it that far			0
' this campaign to bring back ' good manners ' comes after a @entity88 business owner told parents with noisy children to steer clear of her cafe and a @entity94 - born @entity93 barista was denied work because he was black at @entity98 premises earlier this year			1
the @entity100 owner @entity99 in @entity101 , near @entity88 , north of @entity102 , asked customers to refrain from bringing their unruly offspring into her establishment in a @entity107 post			0
the post , which was made about a week ago , sparked such a backlash from people that it has since been removed			0
but ms @entity99 said business had never been better despite the negative comments			0
two months before that , @entity112 was rejected from a job at @entity116 and @entity117 café in @entity98 - in @entity102 's inner - city - with owner @entity118 citing he ' had not seen @entity120 baristas ' before			2
mr @entity118 has apologised to mr @entity112 but said he stood by his decision to not hire the 39 - year - old .			0

@entity4 on @entity7 's south coast have put up the tongue - in - cheek sign
the sign price points coffees depending on people 's politeness , starting from $ 5
the @entity5 cafe is owned by *locals* @entity17 and his wife , @entity19
the couple said they wanted to put up the sign to bring back ' common courtesy '
