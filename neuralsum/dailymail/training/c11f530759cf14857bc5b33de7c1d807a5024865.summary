by @entity0 when three - year - old @entity2 started complaining that the back of her jaw was hurting , her mother assumed the little girl 's adult molars must have started to come through			1
' i gave her some @entity8 to help her sleep and waited for the pain to go , ' says @entity11 , 40 , who works part - time as a financial director and is married to @entity14 , 43 , an insurance underwriter			1
but the pain did n't ease , so two days later she took @entity2 to the dentist			1
' i nearly fainted when he told me that @entity2 had serious decay in her baby teeth , ' she recalls			1
' i had n't even noticed			0
she needed root canal work on one of her back teeth and fillings in three more			1
i kept thinking i must be a terrible mother to have let this happen			2
according to new figures from the @entity42 , almost 26,000 children in @entity40 aged between five and nine have been hospitalised for multiple tooth extractions in 2013 - 14 - that 's the equivalent of almost 500 a week			2
removal of rotten teeth is now the primary reason children in this age group are admitted to hospital			2
in some cases , dentists have no choice but to remove all 20 baby teeth from their young patients			1
and those from comfortable lifestyles are at just as much risk as youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds - with middle - class parents feeding their children so - called ' healthy ' snacks that cause more damage than junk foods , and working mums often too busy to take their children for check - ups			1
the legacy can be far more serious than just a phobia of going to the dentist			0
' the best predictor of adult tooth decay is dental health at the age of five , ' says dr @entity75 , a dentist who specialises in cosmetic dentistry and reconstruction			1
' it 's not something that disappears when your baby teeth fall out			1
' dr @entity82 , of @entity83 , a private surgery in one of @entity87 's wealthiest boroughs that caters exclusively for the under - 18s , has seen a steady increase in the number of children needing extensive dental work to save baby teeth since it opened in 2008			1
according to dr @entity82 , part of the problem is that parents think they are giving children ' healthy ' foods and drinks , but it is these that can cause the most damage			1
' parents do n't realise that fruit juices contain more sugar than cola , ' she says			2
' and many so - called healthy snacks are packed with sugar , too			2
' it 's a trap that @entity11 , from @entity110 in @entity111 , admits she fell into with @entity2 , who is now five			1
while she never let her little girl have sweets , she was happy to let her have apple juice in a ' sippy cup ' beaker			1
cavities are caused by two factors : decay , which occurs when bacteria in the mouth react with sugar , causing acids to form that soften and dissolve enamel ; and acid erosion , which happens when acid in food or drink comes into direct contact with enamel			2
although enamel on baby teeth is as hard as enamel on adult teeth , the layer is thinner , making children 's teeth more vulnerable			1
dr @entity82 says that ' sippy cups ' containing juice are a short cut to dental decay			1
' sipping on apple juice all day bathes your teeth in acid soup , ' she says			1
' it 's doubly damaging because it 's both sugary and acidic			0
' smiling again : now @entity28 will stick to giving her daughter water instead of apple juice it immediately made sense to @entity28 : her son , who is 11 , has no cavities - but he has always preferred to drink water			1
she also admits she was n't as strict about dental check - ups as she might have been			0
current advice is that a child should see a dentist at least once a year			0
' i assumed @entity2 's baby teeth would not cause too much trouble and that she could wait until she was older to go regularly to the dentist , ' @entity11 says			1
' we did take her to the dentist after her teeth came through , but not often enough			2
@entity169 flies by , and there 's always work or school commitments getting in the way			2
' then there are the dried fruit snacks - raisins , mango , apricots and the like - beloved by middle - class mums as a ' healthy ' alternative to biscuits and crisps			1
dr @entity181 , chief executive of the @entity182 , says they are a significant problem			0
' raisins are supposed to be healthy - one of your five - a - day - but they are concentrated forms of fructose , or fruit sugar , which reacts with bacteria in the mouth to create acid			1
' they are sticky and cling to the space between the teeth , sometimes for an hour or more , all the time causing potential damage			1
' this is something that stay - at - home mum @entity199 , 35 , from @entity200 , is all too aware of			0
while her eldest child @entity202 , ten , and youngest , @entity204 , three , have had no problems , five - year - old @entity201 first needed fillings at the age of three			2
then , when he was four , he developed severe toothache as a result of an abscess beneath a decaying molar			0
his dentist carried out an emergency extraction under local anaesthetic			0
since then , @entity201 has had another molar removed @entity199 says she always assumed she was doing the right thing with @entity201 by encouraging him to eat lots of fruit and vegetables as a baby - and using sweet fruit to mask the taste of vegetables			2
' i 'd make him sweet potato and apricot , or stewed apple and spinach - and pat myself on the back believing he was getting the most nutritious food i could offer			0
' growing problem : almost 26,000 children in @entity40 aged between five and nine have been hospitalised for multiple tooth extractions in 2013 - 14 ( picture posed by model ) as a toddler , he liked fresh strawberries and mango , and he loved munching raisins while out and about in his pushchair			2
at the age of two , @entity199 took him to the dentist for the first time			0
' the dentist told me he 'd got " pretty bad teeth " and asked what i was feeding him , ' she recalls			0
' when i mentioned raisins , he told me i might as well be feeding him sugar cubes			0
' although i stopped him eating dried fruits straight away , @entity201 continued to snack on fresh fruit - though i 've recently stopped this , too			2
and i wo n't give him flavoured fromage frais now , because that ’s packed with sugar			0
' she points out that many ' healthy ' savoury snacks , such as breadsticks , wholemeal bread and bagels , also contain hidden sugar			0
dr @entity181 says that it 's not just the snacks themselves but the snacking habit that is dangerous			0
' we 've gone from three square meals a day to six or seven snacks , ' he says			0
' this means that teeth are constantly bathed in acid - giving no time for saliva to neutralise it and let the enamel recover			0
' milk is another culprit			0
while many parents assume cow 's milk is a wholesome drink , it too contains a type of sugar : lactose			0
@entity290 milks for children aged from one year upwards also contain added sugar			0
decay is a particular problem if the milk is in contact with the teeth for extended periods			2
there is even a condition called ' bottle cavities ' which develops because a child is left to constantly suck on a bottle of milk ( usually to stop them crying )			0
while people tend to assume that because they 're ' just baby teeth ' they do n't matter , experts say the outcome can be a lifetime of poor dental health			1
prevention : dentists recommend children brush their teeth twice daily with a toothpaste containing fluoride dr @entity75 , who is based in @entity87 , says it 's not just that bad habits are set for life , but if a type of bacteria that leads to cavities gets a foothold in childhood , it can ruin a child 's smile for life			0
' there is an overlap period between the ages of five and nine when baby teeth and adult teeth exist in the mouth together , ' he explains			1
' so bacteria from decaying baby teeth will get to work on the adult teeth , too			1
' so what can parents do to stop their children developing cavities at such a young age ? ' @entity346 tooth brushing , twice daily with a toothpaste containing fluoride , is vital , ' says professor @entity349 , dental public health consultant at @entity351 and chairman of the @entity353			0
dr @entity82 advises parents to give children water rather than fruit juice , and to cut down on snacking			1
she also says that parents have to take responsibility for brushing their children 's teeth until at least age eight			0
brushing should last at least two minutes twice a day , and she recommends that children floss from around the age of four .			0

@entity2 , five , had serious decay in her baby teeth and needed root canal work
her mother @entity11 , 40 , from @entity111 , was mortified
she never let her daughter have sweets
but she regularly drank apple juice
*seemingly* healthy fruit juice is a big culprit in tooth decay
dried fruit like raisins can also cause damage
