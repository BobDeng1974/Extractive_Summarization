by @entity0 published : 01:42 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 02:26 est , 4 october 2013 hundreds of acres of an ancient forest are being felled because trees are infected with disease , the @entity1 has said			1
larches in @entity7 's largest ancient forest , @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , have been confirmed as infected with @entity11 , a fungus - like disease which causes extensive damage and death to trees			1
the @entity1 and @entity7 , who own most of the 2,500 acre woodland , are clear - felling diseased larch from one fifth of the forest from this week			2
hundreds of acres of @entity7 's largest ancient forest , @entity8 , are being felled to fight disease trees are infected with @entity11 , a fungus - like disease which causes extensive damage and death but the disease , which has affected larches across south west @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31 , is expected to continue to spread through the forest , requiring further felling in the coming months and years			1
the clear - felling will undermine seven years of work to restore the forest to natural broadleaf woodland through the gradual removal of conifers , that allows regeneration of native plants , the @entity1 said			2
@entity8 is one of a number of sites of ancient woodland planted with conifers in the 1940s and 1950s to provide fast growing wood for building , leading to dense shading , soil disturbance and acidic soils which damage natural species			0
ancient woodland covers 2 per cent of the @entity54 , and damaged sites planted with conifers make up half that figure , the @entity1 said			0
the @entity1 said it is the most ' serious and devastating action ' taken on the estate immediately after felling the larches , the @entity1 will replant the wood with native broadleaf trees such as oak and cherry in the hope of preserving woodland specialist plants that only thrive when sheltered by the tree canopy			1
the replanting will leave the @entity1 with a £ 35,000 bill , as there are no restocking grants available in @entity7 this year , unlike @entity28 , where grants are available , the charity said			0
@entity73 , @entity1 head of woodland management , said : ' this is the most serious and devastating action we 've had to take on our estate and it again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come			1
' restoration will allow native trees to establish themselves over a long period of time			0
' creating a resilient woodland landscape with different species of trees of different ages is the most effective natural weapon to ensure tree disease does not decimate the countryside			0
' @entity8 is @entity7 's largest ancient forest and covers 2,500 acres outside @entity9 , @entity10 @entity95 , from @entity96 , said : ' the felling in @entity8 is very sad but this prompt action by the @entity1 ( @entity99 ) is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease			1
' he said @entity96 had invested £ 500,000 to stop the spread of the disease and an additional £ 2 million had been set aside for future work			0
' our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the @entity1 is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within @entity8 by planting native broadleaves			2
' @entity116 across the @entity54 is under threat from a number of tree diseases , including the arrival last year of ash dieback , which seriously damages and kills large numbers of ash trees , an important native species .			0

@entity1 said it is ' most serious and devastating action ' taken on the estate
