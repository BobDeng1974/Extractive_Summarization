when @entity1 became top boss of the @entity3 seven months ago she had no inkling a nuclear crisis was brewing			1
but once it erupted in the form of exam - cheating by dozens of missile launch officers , she quickly announced conclusions that no @entity3 leader before her had dared state publicly			1
the nuclear missile corps ' problems run deep , she said , morale is ' spotty ' and forceful fixes are needed			2
@entity17 reached those conclusions in january after a short visit to the three @entity3 bases that operate intercontinental ballistic missiles , or icbms			1
secretary of the @entity3 @entity1 speaks to the @entity24 during an interview at the @entity26 on july 11 she met not only with commanders but with the rank - and - file , including enlisted airmen who keep the missiles running properly and junior officers trained to launch them			1
' i walked away believing there was something systemic , cultural if you will , that went beyond cheating and ( that 's ) why i felt like we needed to not just address cheating — yes , we have to fix that — but we need to go farther than that , ' she said in an @entity24 interview in her @entity26 office overlooking the @entity42			2
to her it seemed natural to acknowledge this publicly , although others in the @entity3 had chosen not to			1
' i hope and believe i am a straight talker , ' she said			2
' i think it 's better to just say it			0
and so i thought it was important to just stand up publicly and say what seemed to be obvious to me			0
' her candor and crisis management have won praise from @entity56 and @entity57 alike			0
' she has forged relationships with troops and listened to their inputs , ' said rep. @entity63 ' @entity62 , the @entity64 @entity56 who is chairman of the @entity66			0
' she has identified shortfalls in @entity69 leadership and made corrections			0
that is a sharp difference from the way @entity3 leadership has handled these issues in the past			1
' @entity17 , 55 , is only the second woman to serve as @entity3 secretary , the service 's top civilian official			1
she took office in december 2013 following months of @entity24 reports documenting problems inside the nuclear missile corps , starting with the sidelining in april 2013 of 19 launch officers at @entity85 in @entity86 for what commanders called attitude and performance flaws			1
it was an unprecedented action and coincided with the @entity24 's publication of an internal email from an officer at @entity85 complaining of ' rot ' inside the icbm force			2
@entity97 been praised for the way she handled the @entity3 exam scandal senior @entity3 officers at the time generally dismissed the reports , saying any problems were localized and limited			1
' i do n't particularly agree that we have any compelling problems ' in the icbm force , maj. gen. @entity103 , the top nuclear weapons staff officer at @entity3 headquarters , said in june 2013			1
' the morale of our crews out there — i 've been out there — is exceedingly , exceedingly , good			0
' @entity17 took a look for herself in january 2014 and saw something different , worse than she had imagined			0
she traveled to each of the three icbm bases after disclosing at a @entity26 news conference that 34 launch officers at @entity123 in @entity124 had been implicated in a cheating scandal and a small number of those were also suspects in an illegal drug use investigation			1
( the number implicated in the cheating later rose to nearly 100			1
) before @entity17 hit the road she quickly gathered enough information about the dimensions of the cheating to satisfy herself that it did not amount to ' a major problem that could be of catastrophic consequences '			2
' but still , why did this happen and what is going on ? ' she asked herself			0
what she found was a set of interconnected problems that went deeper than the cheating			1
she spotted morale issues , with airmen asking , in essence , why is it that the @entity3 claims the nuclear mission is its no. 1 priority and yet missile facilities are in poor shape and spare parts are in short supply ? ' some of the things i saw had been of a longstanding nature , ' she said			1
' so why had these things not gotten fixed before ? it 's a good question , and i ca n't really answer that			0
' @entity17 , a native of @entity161 , @entity162 , never served in the military but spent a decade — from 1983 to 1993 — as a professional staff member on the @entity66 , which has oversight responsibility for the @entity26			0
from 2002 - 13 she was a senior executive at @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169			0
@entity170 , who was on the professional staff of the @entity172 while she was a counterpart on the @entity66 side , said he was not surprised that she quickly sized up the nuclear problem and attacked it head on			0
' she is wise enough to know that you can not fudge your way through a political problem if you do n't solve it			0
the way she handled the icbm problem was typical @entity184 , ' said @entity170 , who also worked closely with @entity17 from 1993 - 97 when he was the @entity26 's budget chief and she was assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs			2
@entity170 , who later was deputy defense secretary , is now president and chief executive officer of the @entity189 , a @entity187 think tank			2
@entity17 said she was surprised by the @entity69 crisis , but not unprepared			0
' life comes at you fast and furious sometimes , ' she said with a grin .			0
