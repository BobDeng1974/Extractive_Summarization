by @entity0 @entity1 is investigating an unofficial fraternity after emails between the brothers referencing rape , assault and drug abuse were leaked last week			1
@entity8 is not an official campus club , but the remnants of fraternity @entity11 which was shut down in 2001 after several hazing and alcohol abuse incidents			1
the remaining brothers renamed themselves after their chapter name and have continued to recruit on campus			2
over 70 emails and text messages between the brothers , which date back to 2012 , were posted on a @entity21 account last thursday by an anonymous source			2
shocking : an unofficial fraternity at @entity1 is drawing criticism after over 70 emails between brothers were leaked last week			1
many of the emails make light of sexual abuse , like the one above some of the emails talk about using drugs like lsd and adhd medication @entity35 , but the most concerning exchanges reference rape			2
in one email about organizing a mixer , one of the brothers writes that they should set up pre-games before hand where the girls will get drunk with the guys they know and are more comfortable with			2
' then [ when ] they start getting f * * * * * up we switch them from apartments so they are f * * * * * up when they meet brothers they know less and would hook up with easier , ' the brother writes			0
unofficial institution : @entity8 has at @entity1 since 2001 , formed when @entity11 was shut down for hazing and alcohol abuse another email shows the brothers discussing how to best cover up a female 's allegations that she was hit by a brother			1
' let 's formulate an excuse			0
for the remainder of the semester , we feign ignorance - our brotherhood already met for the last time ... none of us have heard anything except rumors from outside			0
' another brother offered a more horrifying response : ' it seems like damage control is very straightforward : someone needs to stuff a d * * * in that [ redacted ] girl 's mouth with the quickness			0
' according to the @entity21 , the messages were posted in order ' to promote safety of @entity1 students and speed up the disciplinary process for the individuals involved '			0
@entity1 president @entity85 issued a statement saying the emails require ' immediate attention ' because ' allegations include high risk and harmful behaviors that ... may represent breaches of our student conduct code and of the law			1
' plotting : in one of the emails , a brother writes at length about how to best take advantage of drunk girls serious allegation : while discussing which girl should be named the fraternity 's ' sweetheart ' , one of the brothers speaks about a girl whose friend was allegedly raped at the fraternity ' that these alleged behaviors may have occurred within our community reminds us that we are not immune from the problems that have occurred on campuses across the country , ' president @entity85 wrote			1
' this situation can not be viewed as an isolated set of circumstances			0
' and this is n't the first time the university has tried to shut the frat down			0
in 2006 they threatened to disband @entity8 , saying it posed threats to the community because ' it does not follow any sort of bylaws and engages in questionable behavior such as hazing and excessive drinking '			2
however , it 's hard to target an unofficial society and the group continued to prosper - much to the dismay of residents near the @entity139 campus			1
in a single year , the fraternity was responsible for 15 neighborhood complaints including ' loud parties , public urination and trash			0
' but they may not be so lucky this time			0
in addition to criticism from the school administration , a @entity150 petition to shut the group down has garnered over 1,000 signatures .			1
