despite the obvious delight in finding his long - lost cat @entity3 , @entity0 must have had some concerns about letting her loose on @entity6			1
ever since @entity8 replaced @entity9 as prime minister , there has only been one feline ruling the roost on the famous street			0
@entity17 the cat - the prime minister 's pet - was often spotted by famous dignitaries , reporters and photographers hunting for prey			0
new predator : mr @entity8 has brought in chancellor @entity0 's tabby @entity3 ( above ) as chief mouser at @entity25 in @entity17 's place turf war : when @entity3 was returned to @entity0 , there would no doubt have been some concerns as to how she would get on with @entity17 , the prime minister 's cat but a few weeks ago , after @entity0 's long lost cat @entity3 was found safe and well - @entity17 's world turned upside down			1
no longer was he the only @entity6 cat , which must have led to concerns about a turf war between the two pets			0
but if these latest pictures are anything to go by , it seems the chancellor has little to worry about			0
new friend : the prime minister 's cat @entity17 , pictured , has had the run of @entity6 since @entity8 took office @entity3 was pictured yesterday prowling the famous street and getting used to her new surroundings , clearly unafraid of upsetting @entity17			1
chancellor @entity0 and his family had assumed @entity3 had vanished for ever up until recently			1
@entity3 was just a few months old when she went missing from the @entity50 ’ @entity52 home three years ago			1
mr @entity0 , wife @entity53 and their two young children @entity54 and @entity57 searched the streets of @entity59 and put up ‘ lost ’ posters , but to no avail			0
nice surprise : the chancellor and his family had given up hope of finding @entity3 after she went missing three years ago they gave up hope long before moving into @entity6 last year , assuming the cat had got lost – or worse , been run over			1
so they transferred their affections to the family budgie , @entity72 , named after @entity73 hero @entity72 , and two goldfish			0
but two weeks ago , @entity53 , an author , received a phone call telling her @entity3 was alive and well			1
she had been living as a stray in a garden a few streets away from the @entity50 ’ @entity52 house , lovingly fed and looked after by a neighbour who had not seen the posters			1
@entity3 , looking particularly well - nourished , was reunited with the @entity82 after a visit to a vet revealed a microchip beneath its skin bearing mrs @entity88 ’s phone number			2
a few days later , @entity3 , looking fit and healthy , was installed in @entity6			2
the @entity50 live in the flat above no 10 , which they moved into more than a year after the 2010 election , while the @entity92 live above no 11			0
before @entity3 was let loose in the garden , she was introduced to @entity17 , the @entity92 ’ cat			2
a @entity96 spokesman said recently : ‘ she is settling in nicely and getting on well with family , staff and @entity17			0
’ neighbour : the @entity92 ' cat @entity17 ( pictured ) is getting on well with @entity3 trading places : @entity3 lives with the @entity82 in the flat above no 10 ( right ) , while the @entity92 and their cat @entity17 live above no 11 ( left )			2

tabby cat @entity3 went missing from the @entity50 ' @entity52 home three years ago
but she was recently reunited with the chancellor and his family after being found safe and well
