a @entity1 fan has a message for humanity : can we boldly go where no man has gone before - and build a fully - functioning @entity6 ? visit @entity7 , and you may believe you have stumbled upon the blueprints of a @entity11 - funded project , so complete and fully - fledged are the blueprints			1
every detail of the first @entity15 has been planned out to the smallest degree , from the inner workings of the ' gravity wheel ' to the coverings on the exterior shielding , as well as the outline of the first ten missions and the political problems that will have to be overcome			1
naturally , there are some differences : captain @entity26 and his crew explored the universe in 2250 or thereabouts , and the increase in technology advances gives @entity26 and co a distinct advantage , such as warp drives powered by anti-matter and teleportation devices			1
still , ' @entity36 ' a systems engineer whose job involves trialling new technologies , believes we can build his model within the next 20 years and it can then be a vessel for humanity , using nuclear generators to take us to the moon in three days and to @entity44 in 90 days			1
the @entity46 - do spirit : systems engineer ' @entity36 ' has methodically worked out any kinks to get the @entity15 in the skies the ship - otherwise known as the @entity15 - is a faithful - and more importantly , a technically possible , recreation of of the biggest shows in @entity54 history			1
however , as creator ' @entity36 ' points out , ' many changes are needed inside the @entity57 ship to make the ship compatible with the technologies of the first half of the 21st century			1
' keep in mind that the @entity63 adventures in the @entity65 ships take place starting in the year 2245			1
our technology today is just not up to building a starship - that will have to wait for a @entity72 ship or later			1
but this does n’t mean that the @entity74 will not be awe - inspiring and similar in many fundamental ways to the @entity76 of the future			1
' he added : ' the @entity74 will be the same size as future @entity76 or larger			1
it will have 1g gravity like the future ships and ample comfortable living space			2
it will have a bridge with 1g gravity where the captain and key crew members will often work			2
' it will have a huge number of sensors for probing whatever the ship encounters in space			2
it can launch landers that descend to a planet below and then return to the ship			2
it will move beyond the brute - force rocket engines of the 20th century by using ion propulsion engines powered by on - board nuclear reactors			2
' yes , this may still be a long way from warp drives powered by anti-matter , but it will be a respectable start			2
' ready for construction : build the @entity15 even goes into great detail about each area of the ship , breaking down what modern - day technology can be adapted to boldly go into space more than an @entity111 , or a @entity112 : the @entity15 would be one of the most ambitious projects built on this planet ( or off it ) bold plans : the full plans to build a real - life @entity15 is laid out online @entity36 continued : ' things get moved around and reworked quite a bit inside the @entity74 compared to the @entity76			1
for example , in the @entity65 - x ships the hanger deck is located in the back of the lower hull and this serves as the launch and entry port for shuttlecrafts			2
' but in the @entity74 this lower hull section instead houses the main engine and main nuclear reactor			2
for the @entity57 ship , the spaceport entry doors are on the underside of the saucer hull			0
' the reason for this is that in the @entity74 every bit of the three hull sections to the rear of the @entity15 are needed to house the three engines and nuclear reactors that will be needed to provide enough power to move the massive ship with the required .002g constant acceleration			0
' another example of a change is that the bridge is not at the top center of the saucer hull as it is shown in the figure above			0
if it was there in the @entity74 then there would be no gravity on the bridge			0
having the ship ’s captain and crew floating around inside the bridge just makes no sense			0
thus , in the @entity74 the bridge is in a dedicated section of the gravity wheel so that they will work in 1g gravity			0
' while things get moved around quite a bit inside the @entity74 when compared to the ships from @entity63 , they are not moved around upon a whim			0
they are moved around because the @entity57 ship ’s technological capabilities demand certain changes			0
' boldly going forward : captain @entity26 ( @entity174 ) leads his enterprise crew on another mission @entity36 , who is behind the project , seems qualified for the role , and hopes that even if his project does n't - excuse the pun - get off the ground , his project will inspire @entity183			1
on his website he states : ' in my day job i work as a systems engineer and electrical engineer			1
for 30 years i have worked at the same @entity190 company , a company that is a high - tech leader in the @entity192 and globally			0
' i ’m lucky that in my role i often get to explore new ideas and new technologies when working toward the development of new products			0
the @entity199 website just seems to flow out naturally from the same approach i take in pondering and evaluating new ideas and technologies in my day job			0
' personally , i have found working as an engineer to be very rewarding			1
the work is interesting , the pay is good , your co-workers are bright and enthusiastic , and the unemployment rate in engineering typically runs under 3 per cent – far below the national average for all workers			0
for these reasons i hope that some young people find a bit of inspiration in this website , and that this might even help motivate some to study engineering in college			0
' and okay , for the record , while in grade school i watched the first @entity63 series each week during the original season on tv in 1966 on my family ’s black and white tv			0
' captivated by the image and idea of the @entity15 , i built a long lost model of it from a kit i purchased at a store			1
i was around nine years old			0
so i suppose the @entity15 has been burned into my brain for a long time , just waiting for a chance to get out			0
' more details and complete plans at @entity7			1

engineer says the enterprise could be built with today *'s* technology
he hopes to inspire ' @entity183 ' with his plans to visit @entity44
