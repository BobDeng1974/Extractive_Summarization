@entity0 claims to have cracked a problem that has flummoxed anyone who has tried to read a doctor 's note - how to read anyone 's handwriting			2
the firm claims the latest update to its @entity10 handsets can under 82 languages in 20 distinct scripts , and works with both printed and cursive writing input with or without a stylus			1
it even allows users to simply draw emoji they want to send			2
@entity0 says its handwriting recognition works by ' building on large - scale language modeling , robust multi-language @entity26 , and incorporating large - scale neural - networks and approximate nearest neighbour search for character classification			1
' ' entering text on mobile devices is still considered inconvenient by many ; touchscreen keyboards , although much improved over the years , require a lot of attention to hit the right buttons , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity38 input is an option , but there are situations where it is not feasible , such as in a noisy environment or during a meeting			1
' using handwriting as an input method can allow for natural and intuitive input method for text entry which complements typing and speech input methods			1
' @entity50 is now available on @entity10 phones , and the firm said it took ' many years ' to perfect			1
' @entity50 is the result of many years of research at @entity0			1
' until recently there have been many languages where enabling this functionality presented significant challenges			1
@entity0 also today launched a new feature allowing users who have lost their phone to simply @entity0 it			2
it works with all @entity10 phones that have the latest @entity0 app installed , and it appears to only work when you 're signed into your @entity0 account on @entity67 - although this has n't been confirmed			1
the same @entity0 account must be signed into on the phone			2
the @entity19 firm announced the tool on its @entity74 page			2
it said : ' we ’ve all been there - you ’ve searched under your car seat , tossed around the sofa cushions and you still ca n’t find your phone			0
@entity10 handsets can understand handwriting in 82 languages in 20 distinct scripts ' if you know where your computer is you can now ask @entity0 to find your @entity10 phone from your desktop			1
' if the pesky phone is hiding nearby , @entity0 can ring it for you - or you can see it on the map if you , say , forgot it at the bar			0
' just make sure you ’ve got the latest version of the @entity0 app ! ' @entity0 's latest tool ca n't lock the missing phone , or erase its data			0
users will need to install the @entity99 ( @entity101 ) app ( pictured ) if they want these features			0
both tools override the selected sound profile , too , meaning that even if a phone is on silent it will still ring at full volume for five minutes to locate a lost phone , sign into a @entity0 account on @entity67 via the menu in the top right - hand corner			0
type ' find my phone ' either into the address bar - if @entity0 is set as the default search engine - or open @entity0 and type it into the search bar on the site 's homepage			0
a map appears as the first search result with a message asking the user to sign in again to confirm their identity			0
this prevents people being able to track a person 's phone if the previous user forgets to log out of their @entity0 account on a shared @entity67 , for example			0
@entity0 has announced a new tool that locates missing handsets simply by searching for the term ' find my phone ' on the search engine 's homepage ( animated )			1
it works with all @entity10 phones that have the latest @entity0 app installed and when the user is signed into their @entity0 account on @entity67 the phone 's location is then pinpointed and clicking a ' ring ' button beneath the map will then remotely call the handset			1
@entity0 's latest tool ca n't lock the missing phone , or erase its data			0
users will need to install the @entity99 ( @entity101 ) app if they want these features			0
@entity101 was launched in august 2013 and works in a similar way to the search tool			1
it locates a phone on a map , remotely rings and lets users carry out additional security tasks			0
both tools override the selected sound profile , too , meaning that even if a phone is on silent it will still ring at full volume for five minutes , or until it is answered .			0
