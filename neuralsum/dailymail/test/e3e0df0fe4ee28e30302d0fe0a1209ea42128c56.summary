a @entity1 hospital is being painstakingly moved just eight metres a day on 1,000 metal rollers to prevent it from being demolished to make way for a new road			1
the building , which was built in the 1960s and belongs to @entity7 in @entity8 , was under threat of demolition as it is situated in the path of a road expansion project , reports @entity13			1
but hospital bosses decided to save time and money - and avoid paying for a new building - and employed a team of engineers to put ' wheels ' on the building			1
the two - storey brick hospital outpatient building in @entity1 is being rolled every day on giant metal ' wheels ' the large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and needs more than 1,000 wheels to ' roll ' it now , the two - storey hospital outpatient building in the city of @entity30 , in central @entity1 , is being slowly and carefully pushed just a few metres a day on the giant cylinder - shaped rollers			1
the engineers aim to ' push ' the entire structure south by 17.5 metres to its new , designated spot , away from the demolition zone			2
the ' wheels ' the building is being moved on are large , cylinder - shaped metal rollers			1
the @entity13 reports the large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and requires more than 1,000 wheels to make the daily ' walk ' possible			1
one of the engineers working on the project secures the metal sheeting and rollers which are being used it will take three days of careful and slow rolling to move the hospital building 17.5m to its new , safe spot while it should only take three days to move the building to its newly assigned spot , engineers say the preparation has taken over a month			2
the entire building was initially placed on metal plates , which then had the cylinder - shaped rollers wedged between them			0
the ambitious project is expected to be completed in the next couple of days			0
it is not the first time engineers in @entity1 have carried out such a move			0
in november 2013 a six - storey building in @entity66 which weighed 12,000 tonnes was moved 38 metres with the help of 18 lifting jacks			2
and according to the @entity69 the largest building to have ever been moved in this way is another @entity1 achievement - in 2004 the @entity72 in @entity73 was moved 36 metres and took 11 days to complete			0
the building was 111 feet tall and weighed 15,140 tonnes			0
the building has been placed on metal plates which have cylinder - shaped rollers wedged between them			0

@entity1 hospital marked for demolition because of road expansion project
