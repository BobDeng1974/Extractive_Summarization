mr @entity10 pointedly refused to support next month 's referendum among @entity12 on whether they want to remain @entity3			2
the issue is thought to have been raised by foreign secretary @entity14 after mr @entity10 held talks in @entity16 with @entity17			1
' we continue to urge a peaceful resolution of this critical issue			0
let me be very clear about our position with respect to the @entity7 , which i believe is clear			2
' first of all , i ’m not going to comment , nor is the president , on a referendum that has yet to take place , has n’t taken place			0
' our position on the @entity7 has not changed			2
the @entity1 recognises de facto @entity3 administration of the islands but takes no position on the question of parties ’ sovereignty claims thereto			1
' we support co-operation between @entity3 and @entity5 on practical matters			0
' diplomats in @entity9 believe it is a major coup that @entity10 chose @entity3 for his first overseas trip as @entity1 secretary of state to hold talks with pm @entity17 the two men discusses @entity52 , the @entity54 peace process and @entity1 - @entity56 trade , but did not raise the prospect of @entity3 leaving the @entity56 mr @entity17 became the first world leader to meet with mr @entity10 since his appointment , at the start of an 11 - day tour of @entity62 and the @entity54			1
at a meeting in @entity16 the two men discussed a new transatlantic trade deal between the @entity1 and the @entity56 , before touching on @entity52 , the @entity66 and the @entity54 peace process			1
@entity5 president @entity68 has stepped up her country 's claim to he @entity7 mr @entity10 ’s decision to use his first foreign trip since replacing @entity74 to visit @entity9 is being seen as significant			0
mrs @entity74 travelled first to @entity75 after taking office			0
mr @entity10 said : ' this is no accident that this is the first stop of my trip as secretary of state			2
' officials said the decision to start the trip in @entity62 starting ‘ underscores the degree to which we have common interests and values with our key @entity62 partners , the degree to which we work so closely together in meeting the enormous challenges that we both face around the world ’			0
but it comes after transatlantic relations were strained when president @entity93 and other senior @entity1 figures warned against @entity3 leaving the @entity56			1
@entity16 said that mr @entity10 did not raise the issue of @entity3 's possible exit from the @entity56 as a result of the referendum promised by mr @entity17 during the next @entity99			1

‘ and if asked , the @entity107 will repeat that position			0
it ’s our interest , and we ’ve made that clear			0

as the @entity1 ' global representative , @entity10 is expected to have a firm grasp on geography			0
but during his first major speech as the new @entity1 secretary of state , it seems he invented a whole new country			1
speaking at the @entity129 , mr @entity10 praised @entity131 employees who work in dangerous parts of the world and ' support democratic institutions in @entity135 '			0
except the country does not exist			0
mr @entity10 was actually referring to @entity136 , which he appeared to merge with its wealthier neighbour , @entity138			0
but the spokesman said that the @entity62 focus of today 's discussions was the free trade agreement and the potential for using the @entity3 - chaired meeting of the @entity146 group of rich states in @entity148 in june to take the process forward			1
mr @entity17 and mr @entity10 ‘ reiterated their shared determination to prevent a nuclear - armed @entity152 ’ , said the spokesman			2
both men were hoping for progress on the issue at the meeting of the @entity158 group - made up of the @entity1 , @entity3 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 - with representatives of the @entity165 regime in @entity166 , @entity138 , this week			1

they also discussed the situations in @entity176 and @entity177 following the fall of long - standing regimes as a result of the @entity66			0
but the issue of the @entity7 was not raised , said mr @entity17 's official spokesman			2
it is understood that the @entity3 's row with @entity5 over the future of the islands is likely to be discussed when mr @entity10 meets foreign secretary @entity14 later today			1
a @entity1 official said : ‘ if we ’re asked about the @entity7 , we would underscore we ’ve said before , which is that we recognize the de facto @entity3 administration of the islands and we do n’t take a position on sovereignty			1

' top of our agenda was the @entity54 , including the importance we both attach to ending the @entity238 / @entity237 conflict , ' said mr @entity14			2
' i welcome the focus that he has brought to bear on this issue since his appointment			0
there is no more urgent foreign policy priority in 2013 than restarting negotiations between @entity238 and @entity237			0
' the region and the world ca n’t afford the current dangerous impasse in the peace process			2
if we do n’t make progress very soon , then the two - state solution could become impossible to achieve			2
' there is a burning need for the international community to revive the peace process in efforts led by the @entity1 and supported by @entity62 , @entity259 and other nations			1
my promise to secretary @entity10 today was that the @entity3 will make every effort to mobilise the @entity56 and @entity259 states behind decisive moves for peace			2
