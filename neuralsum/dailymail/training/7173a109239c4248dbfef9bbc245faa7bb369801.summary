by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 23 may 2013 following a number of high - profile hacks @entity2 has boosted account security on the site by introducing two - step logins			1
@entity2 is calling the feature ' login verification ' and when users log into @entity2 they will now be sent six - digit code via text each time , to check they are who they say they are			1
this code will need to be entered onto the login screen in order for users to get access to their accounts			0
users must enter a mobile number to enable the feature			2
each time they log into @entity2 a unique six - digit code is sent via text message			1
this code must be entered to get access to the account go to @entity2			1
click the cog icon in the top right - hand corner and go to the account settings page			2
select ' require a verification code when i sign in			0
' click the link to ' add a phone ' and follow the prompts			0
after enabling login verification , you ’ll be asked to enter a six - digit code that @entity2 send to your phone via text message each time you sign in to twitter.com			1
to disable the feature , go back to account settings and untick the login verification box			1
if you get locked out of your account while two - step verification is enabled , or you lose your phone you must contact @entity2 support and answer a series of security questions			1
the feature is optional and is not currently turned on by default			2
in a blog post , @entity56 from @entity2 's product security team said : ' every day , a growing number of people log in to @entity2			1
usually these login attempts come from the genuine account owners , but we occasionally hear from people whose accounts have been compromised by email phishing schemes or a breach of password data elsewhere on the web			2
' we ’re introducing a new security feature to better protect your @entity2 account : login verification			1
' users can enable login verification on @entity2 by going to their account settings page and selecting ' require a verification code when i sign in '			1
after clicking ' add a phone ' , the user will get a verification code sent to the mobile number which is connected to their account			0
@entity2 has launched two - step logins after a series of high - profile accounts were hacked			2
one account targeted by the @entity88 was @entity89 in march this year			0
other hack victims include @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 once login verification has been enabled a temporary password will be need to log into @entity2 on other devices and via @entity2 apps			1
go to the @entity100 tab of your account settings on twitter.com			2
enter your current account password and hit generate again			0
when prompted to log in to your other device or application , enter your username and use the temporary password that you were provided			0
temporary passwords will expire after one hour			0
this code must then be entered to verify that device to their account			0
each time a user with login verification enabled then signs in at @entity2 , they will be sent another unique six - digit code that they must enter to get access to their account			1
people who share access , such as business accounts , will need to have the code sent to a shared phone or nominate a person to receive the text			0
hackers have previously targeted the accounts of satire - news site @entity92 , @entity133 , @entity134 actor @entity94 , @entity89 , @entity135 presenter @entity93 and more			0
in february , 250,000 @entity2 users had their passwords stolen in an attack			2
@entity56 added that when users try to access @entity2 from apps and other devices a temporary password will need to be generated , from the applications page , to authorise the login			1
however , @entity56 said that existing applications will ' continue to work without disruption			2
' he also said : ' of course , even with this new security option turned on , it 's still important for you to use a strong password and follow the rest of our advice for keeping your account secure			1
' @entity156 and @entity157 already have two - step logins for their respective accounts			0
video : @entity2 introduces extra security measures yet , @entity162 , senior security researcher at @entity163 believes there are pitfalls involved with the two - step verification process : ' two - factor authentication makes it difficult for someone to hijack an account , and its easy to see why @entity2 has chosen to use sms as the second authentication method			1
nearly everyone today has a mobile phone			0
' however , there are some potential pitfalls with using @entity171 as an authentication method			0
many people log into their @entity2 account from their smartphone via the @entity2 app which does n’t require login credentials to be entered each time			1
this means that the same device is being used for both authentication factors and if this device is lost or stolen , whoever finds ( or has stolen ) it will be able to access the account			0
therefore , in effect , there is no longer two - factor authentication			0
' also , it is possible that we will see the development of smartphone - based malware that is specifically designed to steal the sms authentication code			0

@entity2 's new system will send users an email or text each time they log in to their account to verify its really them
the feature is not turned on by default , users must enabled it in account security settings
@entity2 's security team said apps will ' continue to work without disruption '
