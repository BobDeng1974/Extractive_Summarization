@entity156 : a nutritional wonder - food			2
being high in protein means turkey regulates digestion and stabilises insulin levels			0
@entity156 is also an excellent source of @entity163 , which protects against heart disease and may also safeguard against depression			0
a 150g serving of roast turkey also contains 158 per cent of the recommended daily intake of an essential amino acid called @entity170			1
as well as reducing your appetite , and so preventing over-eating , this breaks down serotonin and melatonin , making it easier to remain cool , calm and collected in the face of @entity5 's excitement			2
potatoes : @entity170 's benefits only come into effect if the turkey is digested with carbohydrates - which is where the potatoes come in			2
the body also converts carbohydrates into glucose , releasing insulin and pushing nutrients to the heart , liver and other organs			0
vegetables : as well as containing vitamins , minerals and other nutrients , the vegetables in the perfect @entity5 dinner are high in fibre , helping to ensure that guests feel fuller for longer			2
sweet : the sweet cranberry sauce releases a cascade of powerful ' reward ' substances in the brain , such as dopamine , serotonin and opioids - the latter providing an exhilarating natural high			0
umami : the @entity214 word for ' simply delicious ' is one of our five basic tastes , and is found in vegetables such as red cabbage , as well as in the turkey itself			0
texture : the fat in the gravy , together with the range of textures from crunchy roast potatoes to soft stuffing , helps enhance the ' mouth feel ' of the meal , which is key to our enjoyment of it			1
pudding : the contrast between the slightly salty umami of the main course and the sweet and savoury flavours of the pudding tells the brain that we are ' full ' , stopping us from overeating			0
both @entity5 pudding and mince pies also have a hint of cinnamon , which can stop blood sugar levels from fluctuating and may help lower cholesterol levels			1
