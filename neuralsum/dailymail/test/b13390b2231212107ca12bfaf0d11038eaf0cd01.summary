@entity1 's then sports director @entity0 declared the club were ready for tougher competitions in @entity4 two years ago but tuesday 's @entity6 quarter - final exit suggests they need more time to reach the top			1
@entity1 were knocked out 5 - 1 on aggregate by @entity9 despite @entity10 and @entity11 returning to the @entity13 side but coach @entity14 was not really shocked			1
' those who follow @entity9 know the patience required to win the @entity6			1
you need the means , but also some patience , ' @entity14 said after the 2 - 0 defeat at the @entity21 , which followed last week 's 3 - 1 humbling at the @entity22			0
@entity14 looks on as his @entity1 side were thrashed 5 - 1 on aggregate by @entity9 ' the first qualified for the semi-finals are @entity9 and @entity27			1
@entity28 will certainly be there one day but you have to understand we need time , ' he said after @entity1 's third successive quarter - final exit in the tournament			1
once again , @entity33 striker @entity10 failed to shine in a big game in which his attacking partner @entity35 , despite his limitations , seemed more involved			0
@entity1 saw off @entity37 in the previous round but that was more of a one - tie thing , with @entity41 and @entity42 scoring after @entity10 had been sent off in the second leg			2
@entity42 was below - par in the last two games , being at fault on four of the five goals @entity1 conceded against @entity9 , but @entity1 's problems are collective , conceded midfielder @entity48			1
@entity48 says that @entity1 are still not ready to win the @entity6 and still have work to do @entity42 was given a torrid time over the two legs and was at fault for four of @entity9 's goals ' @entity9 are an institution , a club who have been at the top level for a long time , like @entity60 or @entity27 , ' the @entity55 international said			1
' we have been around for five years only			0
' @entity1 were bought in 2011 by @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , who invested massively in the club hoping to win @entity4 's premium club competition			1
while they never look threatened in the @entity66 , @entity1 have been failing against top - notch opposition			2
' let 's be realistic , they were better than us			0
they will probably win the @entity6 , ' @entity10 admitted			2
star men @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 were unable to influence the game in @entity1 's favour ' as far as we are concerned , it is not possible to reach that goal on short term			2
we have made several big steps and we were eliminated by a superb team			0
' let 's not lie to ourselves , it 's just reality			0
' @entity1 will now focus on winning the @entity84 title for the third consecutive season -- a goal more suited to their capacities -- with a possible treble on the cards as they won the @entity90 and will play the @entity92 final on may 30			0
they are second in the standings behind @entity94 on goal difference but have a game in hand .			0

@entity1 *planned* to be @entity4 's top side after major investments in the club
however , the loss against @entity9 showed they still have long way to go
@entity48 thinks @entity107 's side will win the @entity6
