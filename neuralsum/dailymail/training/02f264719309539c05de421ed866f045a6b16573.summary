@entity2 , if you want to impress a woman , do n’t talk about work			0
an analysis of almost 1,000 speed dates , showed that females switched off when a prospective beau started chatting about his job			1
much more successful , was allowing the woman to talk about herself			1
and , surprisingly , interrupting her			1
talking about your work rather than your date is likely to put off a woman , according to research by scientists researchers from @entity17 in the @entity18 , listened to recordings made during speed dating events , in which a man has just four minutes to impress a woman before moving on to talk to another one			1
researchers studying videos of men and women who had never met before talking together have worked out the science of flirting			1
their findings could help you spot whether someone is interested in you or not			0
1 - 3 minutes if someone begins talking to you by dishing out compliments and being encouraging to things you say , it is a good indicator they are interested - according to the researchers			1
some people will also give a quick flirtatious glance at the start of the conversation			0
crossing legs at any point , though , was a sign that a person was not interested in the other			0
also , if a woman does n't ask many questions , or shrugs a lot , she probably is n't interested			0
4 - 6 minutes if the person is still attracted to you , they will likely be even more affirmative , and also still quite complimentary			0
they will also begin ‘ palming ' - talking using open palm gestures			0
7 - 9 minutes now , people start to do - away with compliments			0
instead , men will gaze at their partner if they are interested at this point , while women might start to divulge some personal details			1
10 - 12 minutes at the end of the conversation , women will open up and be joyful , while still palming , if they are still interested			1
for women , you ’ll want to look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction			2
this means they are still interested			0
at the end of the night , the women are asked which men they would like to see again and vice-versa			1
men will typically say they ’d like to see most of the women again , the females will be choosier			1
both sexes must agree before a proper meeting is set up and so the women hold the balance of power			1
this could help explain why one of the secrets of success was to allow the woman to talk about herself			0
linguist @entity85 said : ‘ we went in assuming that men would talk about themselves			2
‘ and we were surprised to find that the stereotype just was n’t true			0
‘ women in successful dates talked more about themselves			1
they used the word “ i ” more			2
‘ men talked about the woman more			2
they used the word “ you ’ more			2
’ professor @entity98 ’s analysis also showed that women liked men who interrupted them			1
he said : ‘ the men would interrupt a lot			2
we thought interruption would usually be a sign of taking the floor and of being rude but all of these interruptions were sympathetic interruptions			2
‘ they would stop someone and say “ oh , that exactly happened to me too ”			0
‘ they were attentive listening - type interruptions			2
‘ and women , in a date that clicked , showed signs of engagement			2
they varied their pitch a lot , they varied their loudness , they got louder and softer			0
‘ so , on a good date , the woman was engaged and the man was attentive			0
’ however , women really did n’t like men who were hesitant , with time - buying phrases such as ‘ kind of ’ and ‘ sort of ’ interpreted as a sign of awkwardness			1
and they really did n’t like chit - chat about work			0
the professor told the @entity131 ’s annual conference in @entity132 : ‘ the more a man talked about work , the worse the date went			0
women see men who talk shop as having little personality while phrases like ' kind of ' suggested hesitance ‘ we interpret that as if you have nothing to click on , no personal interaction , you fall back to talking about your work and that ’s , of course , a bad thing			1
’ the men , in contrast , were far less choosy			0
asked what the women did wrong in the speed dates , professor @entity98 said : ‘ oh , not much			1

researchers at @entity17 listened to recordings of speed dates
women tended to be choosier than men about meeting up properly again
in successful dates , women tended to use the word ' i ' far more frequently
men in dates deemed to be successful , however , used the word ' you ' more
surprisingly , men who interrupted more often were also more successful
rather than being rude , interrupting suggested men had been listening
