the huge cost of the adidas kit deal with @entity2 that starts next season is going to impact on the @entity5 cricket team			1
@entity6 will need to make cutbacks elsewhere in their global business to afford the staggering £ 750million over 10 years that they have invested in @entity2 - with cricket one of the endangered sectors			1
the @entity13 company have been the teamwear suppliers to all @entity5 cricket sides since 2008 and in 2011 the deal was extended to run until 2017			1
@entity6 have agreed a £ 750million , 10 - year sponsorship deal with @entity2 that huge deal will impact on their other sponsorships , including their relationship with @entity5 's cricket side but it ’s understood that adidas , who will not renew the contract again , want to downgrade the deal in its remaining seasons - so it becomes more similar to the licensing agreement they have with @entity29 rather than one of their marquee partnerships			1
this follows not only the vast sum set aside for @entity34 , but the poor sales of @entity5 replica kit with cricket fans far less likely to wear the team strip to matches than football supporters			1
and adidas have made the strategic decision to concentrate on core sports that will not include cricket			2
the @entity45 are reported to have already started talking to other sportswear companies			1
the @entity45 are believed to have already starting talking to other sportswear companies about new deals @entity49 received decent reviews for his expensive debut as a £ 3.6m - a - year @entity53 pundit at the weekend , even though the @entity54 shamelessly put forward holding midfielder @entity55 as the answer for @entity58 ’s defence			1
former @entity58 player @entity55 , now on loan at @entity60 from @entity61 , just happens to share the same agent - former @entity58 vice-chairman @entity64 ’s son @entity64 - as @entity49			0
@entity49 is being paid £ 3.6m a year to be a @entity53 pundit and made his debut at the weekend @entity49 endorsed @entity55 , who has the same agent as himself , as the answer to @entity58 's defence @entity68 , former advisor to @entity69 , announced his fanciful candidature for the @entity71 in @entity72 a year ago and has laid out his manifesto on a regular basis since			1
yet @entity75 has yet to receive a single nomination from the 209 member associations when five are needed - a clear sign he has outlived his usefulness to @entity69			2
meanwhile , bookmaker - stunt funded ‘ candidate ’ @entity81 , described as a ‘ gold - digger ’ by @entity75 , was in @entity84 trying to court the @entity85 to no effect			2
@entity68 , former advisor to @entity69 , has yet to receive a nomination to be @entity71 president @entity81 , running as a candidate after being paid by a betting company , was in @entity84 trying to get votes the upset in racing about tv national treasure @entity93 snubbing the @entity96 to present the first women ’s @entity97 on april 11 was underlined by champion jockey @entity99 saying he was ‘ disappointed ’ with @entity93 three times in quick succession when commenting about her decision on @entity104			1
@entity93 's snub of the @entity96 to present the first women 's @entity97 has not been well received @entity108 ' agent in @entity109 football agent @entity110 is one of the people being pursued by middle man @entity112 in a private prosecution alleging perjury and fraud to be heard at @entity116 ’ court on february 25			0
this follows @entity112 losing his case after claiming he was cut out of the £ 1m deal - by @entity120 and agency @entity121 - for @entity123 ’s transfer from @entity124 in 2007			2
@entity125 has left @entity121 to set up @entity126 with two other @entity121 personnel , @entity128 and @entity129 , who is also facing perjury allegation summons from @entity112			0
@entity125 ’s clients include @entity133 boss @entity132 and @entity134			0
@entity125 is unlicensed but fifa are disbanding agents regulations			0
@entity132 ' agent , @entity110 , is one of the people being pursued by by middle man @entity112 @entity124 owner @entity140 , after trying to offload the club , is said to be energised about taking the team forward having brought in former @entity58 commercial director @entity142 as ceo			0
nevertheless , there is speculation billionaire @entity147 co-founder @entity146 , the richest owner in the @entity148 whose @entity149 have reached back - to - back @entity150 , could be interested in buying @entity124			0
@entity146 , who was in talks to buy @entity152 in 2007 , part - owns @entity155 side @entity154			0
@entity124 are sceptical about any bid but a source involved with @entity146 ’s investment vehicle @entity159 said : ‘ this is @entity160 talking to @entity160			0
’ the @entity162 ’s highly embarrassing decision to start concentrating on finding an @entity164 sponsor for next season rather than continue their botched search this campaign follows the realistion that any brands showing interest will not be able to free marketing funds to activate the elusive sponsorship for the rest of the tournament .			0
