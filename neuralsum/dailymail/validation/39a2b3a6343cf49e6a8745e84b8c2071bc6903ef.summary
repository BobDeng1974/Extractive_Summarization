if you 've ever gone out , got drunk and made ill - advised calls to exes , friends or family you 'll know the dread and embarrassment that sets in the morning after			2
but now an app has been developed to save you from such shame			0
@entity9 lets you block certain contacts for a period of up to 12 hours while on a night out and only unlocks these numbers if you can solve maths puzzles			1
before a night out , users of the @entity9 app select which contacts they want to block			1
they then choose the timeframe ( left ) , which ranges from three to 12 hours			1
if an attempt is made to contact the blocked number a ' @entity20 ' appears that asks them to solve an equation ( right ) @entity9 was built by @entity24 - based developers from @entity25 before a night out users select which contacts they want to block and for how long			1
this ranges from three hours up to 12			0
if an attempt is made to call or message a blocked contact a ' @entity20 ' pop - up appears			1

it even deletes friendships that the user made overnight , too			0
the self - destruct feature is similar to @entity59 and @entity61 ’s @entity60 , but the developers claim @entity63 is different because photos are only shared within the user ’s geographic area			2
