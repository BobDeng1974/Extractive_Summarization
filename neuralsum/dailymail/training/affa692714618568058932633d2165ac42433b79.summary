by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , 56 , was diagnosed with melanoma four years ago			1
out of her six siblings , she is one in four who has developed the deadly skin cancer it is a cancer that kills around 2,000 @entity8 each year , but prevention can be as simple as checking your skin and being aware of any significant changes			1
now , a new study has revealed the risk of melanoma can quadruple if moles on your skin are present			1
thankfully , @entity2 , a 56 year - old mother of two , was one of the lucky 11,000 @entity8 diagnosed with skin cancer each year , who has lived to tell her story			1
originally misdiagnosed with psoriasis by her gp in the ' 80s , ms @entity2 's skin condition continued to worsen , with up to 16 dry - skin patches increasingly forming over her body			2
it was not until 20 years of incorrect treatment , that @entity2 sought a second opinion with professor @entity29 , director at @entity30 , who told her she was actually suffering from @entity32 's disease , an early form of skin cancer that appears as a continual , slow - growing , red and scaly skin patch			1
aware of her risk to skin cancer , three out of her six siblings had developed melanoma , @entity2 was pedantic at checking for abnormalities , and four years ago she became the fourth sibling diagnosed with melanoma			1
' i was worried because you do n't know the degree of it but i am also pretty cluey with skin			0
' i felt a lump on my fore - arm , it started off as a brown spot and after a couple of months it separated so i went straight to @entity29 and he took a biopsy , ' @entity2 told @entity1			0
a few days later @entity2 received a call from professor @entity29 and was told to come straight back to the clinic to remove the melanoma			0
' it made me panic but i felt it would be ok because the markings has only been on my skin for four months , so i got it early enough			0
' if i had left it who knows where i 'd be today , ' @entity2 said			0
around 11,000 @entity8 are diagnosed with skin cancer each year , with 2,000 of them being fatal @entity2 discovered an unusual marking on her daughter @entity66 , 33 just after giving birth to her first child			1
@entity66 was diagnosed with melanoma in may 2010 and underwent surgery for removal @entity2 describes her mother as being before her time , she said she diligently applying sunscreen to her and her siblings everyday , but unfortunately that did not prevent four out of six of them from developing skin cancer			1
she said the family are fair skinned , with quite a bit of moles covering their bodies			0
' out of the four of us who got melanoma , three of us have fair skin , two red heads but funnily - enough one brother has more of an olive pigment			2
' @entity2 's awareness of skin and the risks of cancer did not only save her life , but her daughter 's @entity66 , aged 33			2
' after my daughter had her first baby in 2010 , i noticed a mark on her arm , which confirmed to be melanoma			0
' when asked how her interest in skin and checking for skin cancers came about , @entity2 said it was something she had always been aware of from a very early age			0
' even though i baked myself out in the sun with coconut oil , going brown as a berry , i was always interested in skin care and my sister is a beauty therapist , so it naturally followed from there			0
' the awareness and knowledge about skin cancer is part of every day life and there is so much more out there these days			1
' @entity2 now goes for check - ups every 6 months and is incredibly grateful for @entity124 and the studies that are being conducted			0
' i think @entity29 is doing a wonderful job			0
' before him i had skin cancer all over my body that i thought was psoriasis			1
i have confidence in him and we are very fortunate to have people like that in @entity134			0
' professor @entity29 ( left ) , director at @entity30 , treats said results were shocking , as patients with moles were 4.6 times more likely to develop skin cancer for professor @entity29 , a world leader in skin cancer diagnosis and treatment , the results were shocking , as patients with moles were 4.6 times more likely to develop skin cancer , compared to the previous misconception that the risk only doubled if benign or unusual moles are present			1
the case - link study , conducted by the @entity150 , university of @entity152 and the @entity153 , compared the medical records of two groups of people - 271,656 for who had moles checked during a hospital visit for any condition , and 10,130,417 who did not have moles recorded			1
' patients go in for a check - up and some are told everything is alright but the people who have self - identified as having moles and has been assessed , are the ones who need to be very mindful and make sure they are going for regular examinations , ' professor @entity29 told @entity1			2
despite these significant findings , professor @entity29 believes vigilance is key and fatality can be prevented			0
' melanoma has improved - the success rate has jumped from 80 per cent to 90 per cent , that means 9 out of 10 people can expect to be cured at the time of removal			2
' but for 10 per cent of people , the melanoma would end up spreading to other organs , called metastases spread			2
' he says patients who have metastases spread , considered as @entity188 , has a 25 per cent chance of surviving a year , and only 2 per cent chance of a two year survival			0
superficial spreading of a patient of professor @entity29 acral lentiginous melanoma is a fare melanoma usually found on the palms , soles , under the nails and in the oral mucosa although melanoma is the least common cancer , it is also the most serious type of skin cancers , with @entity8 having one of the highest rates in the world			1
professor @entity29 puts this down to @entity8 being closer to the equator and a population of @entity211 settlers			0
' the @entity212 have a very low risk of melanoma because of the protection provided by their skin pigmentation , but the northern @entity211 , people with blue eyes , fair skin and red hair are at an increased risk since moving to @entity8			1
' a very good study that was done years ago showed that people who moved to @entity8 before the age of 15 would see their risk increase dramatically			1
' he explains in @entity228 , the base line risk of melanoma is 3 per cent , compared to a 10 per cent rise in @entity232 , where people typically spend more time outdoors and see more sun. but despite somber figures , the new study reveals can be taken in a positive light that skin cancer can successfully be treated if people take responsibility and diligently check their skin			1
' people who have a history of moles and have had check - ups need to look out for new moles			2
' for children up to the age of 15 or 16 it is normal to develop new ones , but if you have a mole with undergoing change , shape or colour or even something on you skin that bothers you , that 's an indication that you should get your skin checked			0
' nodular melanoma when melanoma develops in a pre-existing mole , there is usually : * an area of colour change * growth * change in colour * or even a new mole develops in an adult he also describes the ' ugly duckling phenomenon ' : * if there is something on your skin that bothers you or makes you feel uneasy professor @entity29 recommends seeing a doctor after 4 - 6 weeks if you notice the ' ugly duckling phenomenon ' on your skin			2

a new study reveals having moles on your skin can quadruple the risk of developing melanoma
the case - link study compared people who had moles checked , with people who did not have moles recorded
around 11,000 @entity8 are diagnosed with skin cancer each year , with 2,000 of them being fatal
@entity295 is one of the lucky 11,000 @entity8 who has survived the deadly skin cancer
