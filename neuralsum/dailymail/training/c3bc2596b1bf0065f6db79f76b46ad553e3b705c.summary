bare legs are a badge of honour in the cycling world – a sign that you have finally joined the ranks of elite bikers			2
until now it was n't known whether shaving your calves really made you any more of a contender for the @entity12			2
but a recent study has found that , far from being a bizarre trend , there may be a scientific basis to picking up the razor before cycling			0
earlier this year , @entity27 - based manufacturer , @entity26 , posted a video claiming that shaving legs could reduce drag by seven per cent			1
that means a cyclist can exert 15 watts less power and still go at the same speed			1
the saving is equivalent to changing from a round - tube frame to an aero - style one			0
‘ we were shocked , ’ @entity39 , who heads aerodynamics at the firm , @entity43 magazine			2
‘ the numbers dropped so much it set my b * * * * * * * meter off			0
i had to immediately check the equipment to make sure it was real			0
’ doctors have reported a sharp rise in the number of men wanting cosmetic treatment to have unsightly thread veins removed from their legs			2
in the three months following @entity58 ’ @entity12 victory in july , 10,000 new members joined cycling @entity59 , donned their lycra and took to the roads			0
however , many also decided to replicate their cycling heroes by shaving their legs			2
these unsuspecting men were surprised to discover red and blue thread veins previously hidden by the hairs on their legs			0
thread veins are typically thin spidery veins which are prominent and can be unsightly			0
dr @entity69 , specialist thread vein practitioner at dr @entity70 , a nationwide doctor - led consultancy which specialises solely in removing thread veins , has treated more than 50 male cyclists since september 2012 at his practice in @entity76			0
the reports emerged not long after doctors noted a sharp rise in the number of men requesting cosmetic treatment to reduce the effect of ' drinker ’s nose ' - unsightly thread veins on the face often blamed on heavy drinking			0
the experiment began when pro-triathlete @entity89 showed up for a tunnel testing session with very hairy legs			1
his legs were so hairy , that the @entity26 team placed him on the high - end of something they called the ‘ @entity96			1
’ as a joke , he decided to shave his legs and see how much time it knocked off during his tests in the wind tunnel			1
‘ for me , a half @entity104 is a four - hour race , and the winning margin can often be less than a minute , even 30 seconds , ’ mr @entity89 told @entity102 at @entity103			1
‘ if you can find something that shaved 15 seconds or 30 seconds - or maybe a minute or two - is huge			1
’ the experiment began when pro-triathlete @entity89 ( pictured ) showed up for a tunnel testing session mr @entity89 ' legs were so hairy , that the @entity26 team placed him on the high - end of something they called the ‘ @entity96 '			1

the test was done by pro-triathlete @entity89 in a wind tunnel
after shaving his legs , he reduced his drag by around seven per cent
that means cyclist can exert 15 watts less power and go at same speed
‘ for me , a half @entity104 is a four - hour race , and the winning margin can often be less than a minute , even 30 seconds , ’ said mr @entity89
