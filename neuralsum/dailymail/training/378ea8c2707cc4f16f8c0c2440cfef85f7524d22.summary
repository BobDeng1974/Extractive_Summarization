a pro-palestine group projected the national flag on to the @entity2 in @entity3 early this morning calling for an end to the bloodshed in @entity6			2
the stunt was claimed by the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , which said it projected the flag , complete with slogans including ' @entity12 ' , ' sanctions now ' and ' stop the massacre ' , in an attempt to put pressure on the @entity17 government to take action			1
but their protest , which came in the early hours as @entity21 and the @entity22 jointly announced a 72 - hour ceasefire between @entity24 and @entity25 , was condemned by @entity26 , who called it ' offensive to the @entity17 public ' and accused the @entity9 of being motivated by a ' hatred of @entity24 '			1
meanwhile an east @entity3 mayor raised the @entity33 flag above the town hall for the second time after the first one was allegedly stolen			1
police went to the civic offices yesterday but the flag had gone - the council said it had been ' ripped from the flagpole in an act of perceived vandalism ' - so mr @entity40 , who is to face trial over allegations of voting fraud , raised another one			1
today a @entity49 spokesman said they had received an allegation of theft in relation to the flag and were investigating			2
so far the death toll of the latest conflict has reached at least 1,450 palestinians , many of them civilians according to @entity6 health officials , and 61 soldiers and three civilians on the @entity24 side			2
today @entity73 , chairman of the @entity9 , said his group had projected the @entity33 flag onto the houses of @entity77 because they were ' outraged ' that the @entity17 government was ' standing by while @entity24 slaughters @entity33			1
' he said : ' @entity79 has failed to listen to the voices of hundreds and thousands of @entity17 people who have taken to the streets			2
he has failed to stand up for an occupied people being ruthlessly murdered by an occupying power			0
' the prime minister has weakly accepted the @entity21 ' political position , which is totally out of step with the mood of this country			1
it is time for firm action consistent with international law			0
' controversy : a second @entity33 flag has been raised above @entity42 town hall in @entity3 after the first one ( pictured ) was ripped down yesterday - its @entity41 mayor @entity40 called for a ceasefire the @entity9 wants mr @entity79 to demand an end to the bloodshed in @entity6 , and impose an arms embargo and sanctions on @entity24			1
mr @entity73 said : ' people are really angry that this injustice is continuing despite our ability as a nation to pressure @entity24 to end the attacks			2
' the government must not delay in responding to the moral and public demands it faces			0
' board of deputies vice president @entity113 , vice-president of the @entity114 , said the stunt was ' offensive to the @entity17 public '			1
he told @entity117 : ' we do nâ€™t need to import conflicts in the @entity120 to this country			0
we should instead be exporting values and efforts designed to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict			0
' the @entity9 has once again shown itself to be an irrelevant and extremist pressure group			0
it appears to be motivated by nothing more than a hatred of @entity24 , the only democracy and true ally of the @entity132 in the @entity120			0
' the @entity9 is silent on the rockets and tunnels of @entity25 , an internationally proscribed terrorist organisation , but extremely vocal against prime minister @entity79 whose statements on the @entity6 conflict have been measured , and constructive			0
' @entity42 ' @entity41 mayor @entity40 , left , raised a second @entity33 flag above the town hall ; while today 's @entity141 stunt follows the 1999 incident when an image of tv presenter @entity144 was shown questions arose as to how the image came to be projected onto the landmark building			1
a spokesman for the houses of @entity77 said usual protocol for anyone wishing to project an image onto the building is to apply in advance			0
' he said : ' applications are considered by the @entity156 , which is made up of mps , but i am not aware of an advance application having been made in this case			0
' a spokesman for @entity162 , which governs the other side of the river from where the projection probably came , said : ' @entity168 council only issues a licence for projections after a public consultation , the granting of planning permission and approval of the building owners			2
' no permission was applied for , or given , in this case			0
' ' i do n't want to see the flag of any foreign belligerent flying over the town hall that residents in @entity42 pay for ' - @entity42 resident a @entity49 spokesman said they had not aware of any complaints or security issues with regards to the flag 's projection on @entity141 , an incident which had echoes of the 1999 magazine stunt in which the naked image of television presenter , @entity144 , was projected onto the building			1
pressure increased on the government to take action against @entity24 as local authorities around the country debated whether or not to follow the lead of mr @entity40 in @entity42			2
controversy raged after he raised the first flag in @entity3 , with one critic saying : ' i do n't want to see the flag of any foreign belligerent flying over the town hall that residents in @entity42 pay for			1
' the same flag was raised in @entity211 , where the council is run by @entity213 , in @entity214 , and in @entity215			0
@entity217 's council decided not to accede to pressure to fly the flag , stating that it only flew a few standards including the @entity222 flag , the city flag and the royal standard			0
today @entity6 officials said at least four @entity33 had been killed by @entity24 tank fire nearly two hours after @entity24 and @entity25 began observing a three - day ceasefire			1
@entity229 official , @entity230 , and @entity6 police spokesman , @entity233 , said 15 other @entity33 were wounded in the shelling east of the southern @entity6 city of @entity236			0
an @entity24 army spokesman in @entity238 said the military was looking into the incident , which came shortly after the 72 - hour ceasefire began at 8am local time , 6am bst .			1
