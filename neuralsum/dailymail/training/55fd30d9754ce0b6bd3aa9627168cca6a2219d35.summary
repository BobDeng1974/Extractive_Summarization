it is one of the most recognisable pictures ever taken and an image that not only defined a war , but defined the career of the man who took it			1
@entity8 was just nine years old when she ran naked towards @entity10 photographer and @entity12 winner @entity13 screaming ' too hot ! too hot ! ' as she headed away from her bombed @entity15 village			1
she will always be remembered for the blobs of sticky napalm that melted through her clothes and left her with layers of skin like jellied lava			2
her story has been told many times over the last 40 years since the shot was taken			2
but now , to mark four decades since @entity25 took the picture he has released more moving images that he took during the @entity28 that chart the horrors of that fateful day in 1972			1
@entity25 took this picture just moments before capturing his iconic image			1
it shows bombs with a mixture of napalm and white phosphorus jelly and reveals that he moved closer to the village following the blasts @entity15 @entity39 rush to the point where a descending @entity42 helicopter will pick them up after a sweep east of the @entity46 town of @entity47 in june 1970 trees are ravaged in the background to this picture of a @entity15 tank crew as the soldiers inside abandon it after being hit by b40 rockets and automatic weapons two miles north of @entity55 in eastern @entity56 when compared with the first image it becomes apparent that @entity25 actually started heading towards the village following the napalm attack			1
the sign to the right of the picture appears larger while what looks like a speaker to the left of the road is no longer in shot			2
as he headed towards the town and took the photo , which @entity8 has now found peace with after first wanting to escape the image , he would have been unaware the effect his picture would have on the outside world			1
it communicated the horrors of the @entity28 in a way words could never describe , helping to end one of the most divisive wars in @entity84 history			0
he drove @entity85 to a small hospital			0
there , he was told the child was too far gone to help			0
but he flashed his @entity84 press badge , demanded that doctors treat the girl and left assured that she would not be forgotten			0
' i cried when i saw her running , ' said @entity25 , whose older brother was killed on assignment with the @entity10 in the southern @entity97			1
' if i do n't help her - if something happened and she died - i think i 'd kill myself after that			0
' spending so much time with members of the military he also got time to picture them having fun			1
here he pictured youthful civil defence militiamen leap into the flooded @entity108 grove near @entity109 on april 6 , 1969 never far from devastation , @entity110 took this picture of journalists photographing a body in the @entity109 area in early 1968 during the @entity117 offensive a line of @entity15 marines moves across a shallow branch of the @entity121 during an operation near @entity56 , on august 20 , 1970 not all his images are full of death and destruction			1
this one taken on september 20 1970 shows a @entity46 soldier smiling at the camera while on operations in @entity130 back at the office in what was then @entity84 - backed @entity109 , he developed his film			0
when the image of the naked little girl emerged , everyone feared it would be rejected because of the news agency 's strict policy against nudity			1
but veteran @entity130 photo editor @entity140 took one look and knew it was a shot made to break the rules			0
he argued the photo 's news value far outweighed any other concerns , and he won			2
a couple of days after the image shocked the world , another journalist found out the little girl had somehow survived the attack			2
@entity152 , a correspondent for @entity153 who had given @entity155 water from his canteen and drizzled it down her burning back at the scene , fought to have her transferred to the @entity84 - run @entity161 unit			0
it was the only facility in @entity109 equipped to deal with her severe injuries			0
not all @entity25 's images were of death and destruction , however , and one taken two years earlier shows a @entity46 soldier smiling at the camera while on operations in @entity130			1
another shows a group of youthful civil defence militiamen leaping into the flooded @entity108 grove near @entity109 on april 6 , 1969			0
@entity25 became a photographer when he was just 16 shortly after his brother , @entity178 was killed			1
he joined @entity10 under the tutelage of renowned combat photographer , @entity140 , who died last month			2
this picture @entity8 running away from her bombed village when she was just nine is now instantly recognisable and seen as a defining image of the @entity130 war brought together by the iconic picture , @entity25 has met regularly with @entity8 since the image was taken 40 years after he insisted she be taken to a @entity84 hospital the pair were reunited yesterday at @entity189 , @entity190 , as part of celebrations to mark four decades since that fateful meeting soon after newspapers in the @entity84 published is iconic photograph , president @entity196 spoke with frustration to his chief of staff @entity198 calling it into question and suggesting it could have been ' fixed '			1
@entity25 wrote when wires of that conversation were released 30 years later : ' even though it has become one of the most memorable images of the twentieth century , president @entity196 once doubted the authenticity of my photograph when he saw it in the papers on june 12 , 1972 ...			1
' the picture for me and unquestionably for many others could not have been more real			2
the photo was as authentic as the @entity28 itself			0
the horror of the @entity28 recorded by me did not have to be fixed			0
' that terrified little girl is still alive today and has become an eloquent testimony to the authenticity of that photo			0
that moment thirty years ago will be one @entity8 and i will never forget			2
it has ultimately changed both our lives			0
' his life now could be no different to the time he spent charting the horrors of the @entity28			0
he works from the bureau 's @entity230 office in @entity232 and submits courtroom photographs of celebrities or high - profile legal cases , and his images continue to adorn newspapers and websites across the world			1
he has paid tribute the ' @entity8 ' picture in the past , saying it was behind his being lifted from the killing fields of war to take pictures of war			1
this picture shows the aeroplane that dropped the bomb and the full width shot that went on to help bring an end to the war in @entity130			0

@entity255 ' @entity25 's image was almost not printed because of @entity10 's strict policy on naked pictures
@entity25 now works from the bureau 's @entity230 branch covering celebrity court cases
he has been reunited several times with ' @entity8 ' @entity8 who he helped rescue after taking the picture
among his images of devastation , *including* one of the napalm blast , are photos of soldiers *relaxing* and having fun
