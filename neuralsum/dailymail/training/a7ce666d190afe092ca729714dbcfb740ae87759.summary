the @entity0 has issued clarification with regard to the use of radio messages throughout future grands prix			1
last week the @entity0 declared teams and drivers must strictly abide by one of the sporting regulations that states : ' the driver must drive the car alone and unaided			1
' @entity14 's world governing body believed information being relayed across the pit - to - car radio was making it too easy for drivers , and had gone beyond the spirit of the regulations			2
the @entity0 has now made clear what will and will not be tolerated , either via the radio or pit board it resulted in @entity23 motorsport boss @entity22 suggesting there would be confusion and controversy at upcoming races , with his team particularly affected given the battle between @entity30 and @entity31 for this year 's formula one world title			1
in a bid to clear up some of the confusion , the @entity0 has now made clear what will and will not be tolerated , either via the radio or pit board			1
the messages to be banned include : sector time detail of a competitor and where a competitor is faster or slower ; adjustment of power unit settings ; adjustment of gearbox settings ; information on differential settings ; information on fuel flow settings and level of fuel saving needed and information on brake balance			2
on the formation lap ahead of a race there can be no information on clutch maps or settings , for example the bite point , or burn outs			0
teams can no longer answer a direct question from a driver , such as ' am i using the right torque map ? ' , nor can there be any coded messages			0
@entity22 ( above ) suggested there would be confusion and controversy at upcoming races from the @entity71 @entity70 onwards early next month teams will also be banned from informing drivers about tyre pressures or temperatures , and warnings as to brake wear or temperatures			1
for the avoidance of doubt , the @entity0 has ratified what messages can be relayed , and these include : acknowledgement a driver message has been heard ; lap or sector time detail ; lap time detail of a competitor ; gaps to a competitor during a practice session or race			1
with regard to tyres drivers will be informed as to punctures , tyre choice at an upcoming pit stop , number of laps a competitor has done on a set of tyres during a race and tyre specification of a competitor			0
from the @entity71 @entity70 onwards teams will also be banned from informing drivers about tyre pressures or temperatures messages such as ' push hard ' , ' push now ' , ' you will be racing so and so ' or similar are fine , whilst teams can also help by warning of traffic during a practice session or race			0
information relating to gaps between cars in qualifying so as to better position a car for a clear lap is also permissible			2
drivers can also be told of a potential problem with a competitor 's car during a race , and of a competitor 's likely race strategy			0
finally , warnings with regard to yellow flags , blue flags , safety car deployments or other cautions , are also allowed .			0
