incest laws could be scrapped in @entity1 after the government 's ethics council said sex between brothers and sisters should be legal and is a ' fundamental right '			2
the council recommended that the right of ' adult siblings to sexual self - determination ' was more important then the ' abstract idea of protection of the family '			1
it comes after the case of @entity17 , who was jailed for more than three years after having four children - two of which are disabled - with his sister @entity20			1
the @entity21 has suggested that sex between brothers and sisters should be legalised @entity17 was put up for adoption as a toddler and only met his sister when he was 24 and she was 16			1
he was imprisoned for incest in 2008			0
he made an unsuccessful appeal to the @entity28 in 2012 over his right to a family life - as he and ms @entity20 were split up and three of their children were taken into care			1
the youngest was allowed to remain with ms @entity20			0
the @entity21 said in a statement that ' criminal law is not the appropriate means to preserve a social taboo ' , adding that the risk of disability to children is enough to warrant incest being illegal			1
the suggestion of decriminalising incest comes after the case of @entity17 , who was jailed for more than three years after having four children - two of which are disabled - with his sister @entity20 ' neither the consequences for the family nor the possibility for descendants from such incestuous relationships can justify a ban under criminal law , ' it said			1
' incest between siblings appears to be very rare in @entity56 societies according to the available data but those affected describe how difficult their situation is in light of the threat of punishment			0
@entity17 , born in @entity62 , @entity1 in 1977 , was fostered at the age of three after being attacked with a knife by his alcoholic father , and did not meet his mother or sister again until he was 23			2

two of their children have severe mental and physical disabilities , and another has a heart condition which required a transplant			0
@entity17 was sentenced to 10 moths in prison after his second incest conviction , and then a further two and a half years for his third conviction			2

' @entity89 has been told of cases where half - siblings did not grow up together and have only met in their adult lives , ' @entity88 reported it saying			1
despite saying that sex between brothers and sisters should be made legal , the council recommended that sex between parents and children should remain against the law			0
it is believed that incest increases the risk of children being born with disabilities , but the @entity21 dismissed this as an argument for it being illegal , saying that couples with genetic defects are not banned from having children			1
however , chancellor @entity113 's @entity112 party have been quick to push away the idea of legalising incest			2
spokeswoman @entity115 said that it would give out the wrong signal , telling @entity118 : ' abolishing criminal punishment against incestuous actions within a family would go completely against protecting the undisturbed development of children			0
' around two to four per cent of @entity1 have had ' incestuous experiences ' , according to an estimate by the @entity126 reported by @entity127			0
incest is illegal in the @entity129 and most of @entity132 , though sex between consenting adults who are related is legal in @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 .			0
