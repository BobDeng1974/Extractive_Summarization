by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 17 july 2013 when @entity4 's husband @entity2 broke his neck in a cycling accident and became almost completely paralyzed , she had to face her ideas about a person 's right to die in a devastatingly personal way			1
as an international leader in the euthanasia movement , the professor of philosophy and bioethics at the @entity13 has written ' wheelbarrows full ' about the right to death for terminally ill and seriously injured people			1
@entity4 's husband , @entity2 , was 66 at the time of his accident in 2008			1
he was cycling down a hill in @entity24 in @entity25 when he collided with another bicycle and somersaulted in the air , severing his spinal cord when he landed on his neck			0
a question of life or death : @entity2 is prepped for surgery in 2010 as @entity33 and son @entity34 look on expert : an authority on the ethics surrounding death , @entity4 is now facing her own husband 's choice to die one year earlier , he had updated his living will to include the clause that should he suffer an illness or injury that left him in a vegetative state , he did n't want any treatment that ' would serve only to unnaturally prolong the moment of my death and to unnaturally postpone or prolong the dying process			1
' but emergency services did n't know about this will , and @entity2 was kept alive until he reached the hospital where he was placed on a ventilator , thus saving his life and creating for himself and his wife the ultimate quandary : life or death			1
@entity4 , 72 , who is known as @entity33 , traces her interest in assisted suicide , euthanasia and the right to a dignified death back to her mother 's painful and difficult death of liver cancer when @entity4 was 21			1
' a person should be accorded the right to live his or her life as they see fit ( provided , of course , that this does not significantly harm others ) , and that includes the very end of their life , ' she has written in one of her nearly 40 journal articles on this subject			0
the terrible injury of her husband of 30 years has n't changed @entity4 's core belief in self - determination , but it 's revealed complexities in the issue she was n't prepared for , not least her own unwillingness to let go of her beloved husband and his reluctance to leave her when he knows she does n't want him to			1
beloved : @entity2 has continued to teach , read and write prodigiously after his devastating accident there 's also decoding what @entity2 really does want			1
before his accident , @entity2 was a gregarious , fit , adventurous outdoorsman with a passion for the @entity100 romantic poets			1
he has a doctorate from @entity103 and worked at the @entity13 as an @entity100 professor			0
' at parties he was the one who ate the most , drank the most , talked the loudest , danced the longest , ' a friend told @entity107			0
now , @entity2 has good days and bad days			2
one bad day in 2012 resulted in the drafting of his ' @entity110 ' when his pain became unbearable			0
' pain eats away at your soul , ' the @entity107 reports he wrote on july 28 , 2012 , using his voice - recognition software to dictate the letter to his loved ones			0
' for many years since the accident i have been motivated by a deep will to live and to contribute to the benefit of others in my small way			0
i think i have done that			0
and i am proud of it			0
but as i have told @entity33 over the past few months , i knew that i would reach a limit to what i could do			0
and i have arrived at the limit over the past couple of weeks			0
' advocate : two of the books @entity134 has written on the subject of assisted suicide for @entity33 , helping her husband to hasten his death when there 's a chance that he might have changed his mind later is a fear that often overrides what @entity2 tells her at any given moment			1
making a decision that can not be undone must be weighed with her own intuition of what @entity2 may feel in the future			2
death and dying : @entity33 has had to face the realities of her scholarly explorations since her husband 's accident @entity4 told the @entity107 that there have been times she 's taken @entity2 to the hospital when he became ill and he later told her she did the right thing , despite indicating on other occasions he wants no medical intervention			1
she does n't believe her husband has yet made the decision to die , but rather his occasional desire to end it all is dependent on pain he might be feeling , or influenced by medications he 's taking			2
in 2012 , following his @entity110 , @entity2 became seriously ill with pleural effusion , or liquid in the chest cavity , and had trouble breathing			2
despite his indication prior that he was ready to die , @entity4 rushed him to the @entity173 @entity4 told the @entity107 that she 'd discussed with her husband the kind of death he wanted , and this delirious , uncomfortable state was not how he wished to go			1
new pain management medications were administered , and now @entity2 says he thinks of his hospitalization with pleural effusion as having a ' happy ending			2
' on good days , @entity2 can do the things that give his life meaning : teaching , writing , reading and interacting with his loved ones			2
his living will states that he was not to be assisted with sustenance and hydration , but @entity2 can no longer eat and is fed through a tube , and the once - active professor is trapped in his wheelchair , with an army of helpers to attend to his physical needs			1
@entity4 still believes in people 's right to choose when and how we die , but her experiences with her husband have shown her is that each individual case is rife with diverse and conflicting issues			1
' what has changed , ' she told the @entity107 , ' is my sense of how extremely complex , how extremely textured , any particular case is			0
' according to the @entity209 , @entity2 and @entity4 are writing a book about their experiences in the wake of @entity2 ' accident			1
@entity33 has continued to advocate for people who want to die and for legislation for doctors to be able to ' hasten death ' in the terminally ill ( for which there is provision in @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 so far )			0
@entity2 , now 71 , has again expressed a wish to die , according to the @entity107			1
he has planned his death for the spring of 2014 , when he will be finished teaching his latest course , on @entity230			2
only time will tell whether he , and his wife @entity33 , will make that choice			0
@entity33 and @entity2 wrote in their last blog entry to date : ' this story does n’t end , and it does n’t need to be a tragedy			2
it ’s still a story of love , even if it ’s love under trial			0
it does n’t end as long as we ’re here to write it , and it is n’t a tragedy if we can keep from letting ourselves think so			0
but we ’re also aware of the knife - edge we walk all the time , when the story could end not because we did n’t have anything more to say , but because we were n’t here anymore to say it			0

@entity250 is a bioethicist and leader in the right - to - die movement
her husband @entity2 suffered a broken neck and became paralyzed in 2008
since then , the couple has personally faced the issues @entity4 has long *hypothesized* about
@entity2 has said he would like to die in the spring of 2014
