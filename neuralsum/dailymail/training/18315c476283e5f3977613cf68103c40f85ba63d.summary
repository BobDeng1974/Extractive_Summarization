' on a tour of duty troops ca n't let their physical fitness drop so we 'd go around bases setting them up with gym equipment			2
' i had to organise three - day packages for the soldiers so they could chill out and relax , doing whatever they wanted - shopping , swimming , sunbathing			0
then when they were refreshed it was back to the frontline where they were getting mortared and shot at			0
' serving soldier : @entity6 , who joined the @entity68 after leaving school , undertook a tour of duty to @entity22 in 2003 by june 2012 , @entity6 had suffered a hip injury and decided he wanted to do ' something a little more sedate where i was n't running around with a pack on my back			1
' he had always dreamed of running his own hotel so to learn the trade he enrolled at the @entity87 in a 14th century castle in @entity88			1
he said : ' i thought i 'd just breeze through the course but it was like a military - style boot camp			0
they managed to break a lot of guys			0
past experience : @entity6 in his @entity129 in 1994 ' there was sleep deprivation , long hours , non-stop work and rigorous inspections			1
it was just like basic training in the @entity68			1
' it was hard but once i 'd left the course with my diploma you realise they were being harsh to be kind			1
it was perfect for training you how to deal with the most awkward guests			2
' during the eight - week course the aspiring butler took lessons in flower arranging and was taught how to produce table decorations , serve a seven - course dinner and hold an umbrella correctly to keep dignitaries dry in a downpour			2
he mastered 25 different ways of folding a napkin as well as the spectacular art of opening champagne bottles with a sabre			0
' the course taught me how to run an entire household from top to bottom , ' he said			0

he said : ' it was a little bit overwhelming because of the magnificent reputation of the hotel			2
if you mention the @entity20 anywhere in the world , people instantly recognise it			0

' they may ask where the best restaurants are or they might want tickets for a show or just to sit and chat			0
' adventure : @entity6 and his wife @entity190 , pictured when they were both stationed in @entity211 in 2009 father figure : @entity6 with his two sons @entity214 , 14 ( left ) , and 12 - year - old @entity215 ( right ) we are here to make sure their stay is as comfortable as possible and they get everything they need			1
' each guest expects you to be their own personal butler so you need to be there			2
you are on call 24 hours a day			0
if a guest says at 2am , " i fancy some salmon on toast " then you 're expected to get it			0
' nothing illegal , obviously , but the priority is to keep the guest happy			0
it 's a full time job and can be quite exhausting			0

i ’m dealing with 20 rooms , all of which will have different requests , so you have to be fast and learn how to prioritise			0
' all these skills applied in the military as they do in civvy street			0
i 'm used to working under pressure and as part of a team as you do in the @entity68			1
' you wo n't see me lose my cool or my temper			0
if something needs to be done , i 'll put it in order			0
' @entity6 believes it is vital that serving soldiers recognise the skills they have learned in the military are valuable in ' civvy street ' , especially when the @entity281 is axing 30,000 troops to save money			1
equally , he thinks employers need to ' break through the perception that soldiers are just running around a battlefield shooting people '			0
the @entity68 recruits people in countless roles , from engineers and drivers to dentists and teachers			1
skills : @entity6 believes it is vital that serving soldiers recognise the skills they have learned in the military are valuable in ' civvy street ' , especially when the @entity281 is axing 30,000 troops to save money @entity6 says he occasionally feels starstruck when bumping into a celebrity in the hotel			1
