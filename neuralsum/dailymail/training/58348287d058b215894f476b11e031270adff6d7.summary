the @entity0 said she has been moved to ' see behind the veil ' during her three - day trip to @entity3			1
speaking during a visit to a female - only centre which offers training and job opportunities this morning , @entity4 said she believed huge strides had been made in empowering women since she last visited almost six years ago			1
the @entity12 's royal correspondent was the only journalist allowed to accompany the @entity0 on her tour to the centre in @entity15 and she told us exclusively afterwards : ' i 've noticed from the last visit i made here in 2006 - five , six years ago now - a sea of change			1
@entity4 was given a drink after arriving at the @entity23 for @entity24 in @entity15 , @entity3 ' talking to all the women , they tell me they feel the difference too			1
' they are in a world that can see and is starting to recognise their talents			2
' i think one of the great examples is the king giving access to the ladies in parliament			2
i think that has made a huge difference			2
' @entity4 continued : ' there is more and more progress all the time			1
' [ this time ] i have had much more of a chance to meet so many women from so many different walks of life - from the women of the @entity46 [ the @entity3 parliament ] , to these wonderful entrepreneurs you see around us here			1
the @entity0 visited the @entity23 for @entity24 in @entity15 ' it 's extraordinary to have the opportunity to see behind the veils			1
it 's been the most remarkable experience			0
' the role of women in society has been the main theme of the duchess ’s visit to the country			2
@entity3 women have few rights and are required , regardless of age , to have a male guardian - typically a father or husband – who must give their permission for everything from opening a bank account to marriage			1
they can not vote or be elected to high office and are prohibited from driving			0
in 2011 a woman from @entity15 was sentenced to ten lashes by whip after being caught behind the wheel			1
women are also required to be segregated from men in public			0
most offices , banks and universities have separate entrances and they are required to sit separately on public transport and in restaurants			0
when it comes to dress , women are also expected to cover all parts of the body that are ' awrah ' - not meant to be exposed			2
@entity3 ’s strict interpretation of @entity90 means they must cover their entire body with a black cloak known as an abaya and headcovering , or hijab , leaving just the eyes and the hands exposed			1
conventions for dress and behaviour are all fiercely enforced by the notorious religious police , or mutaween , whose official title is the @entity105			0
as a member of the @entity108 royal family , @entity4 is not required to wear an abaya - but has chosen to dress ' demurely ' as a mark of respect to her hosts			1
the duchess has already visited @entity116 's women - only university and met with some of the country 's 30 new female mps to highlight some of the steps @entity3 women are taking towards equality			1
today she was at the @entity23 for @entity24 , which provides training and job opportunities for @entity3 women			1
she was greeted by @entity123 , the chairman of the @entity124 , and was given a tour of the training centre , starting upstairs with the beauty and fashion workshops			1
the area is very much women - only with even the duchess ’s male bodyguards forced to wait downstairs			2
one of the classes she watched was on how to apply wedding make - up			2
' would you like to open your own salon ? ' she asked one of the women			0
' i think there is a real demand for this			0
after all , wherever you are in the world , women like to look nice , do n't they ? ' she also chatted to women learning seamstress skills and creating exquisite @entity151 - influenced clothes			2
' it makes me feel so inadequate , ' she joked			0
' @entity154 classes were a disaster			0
i never got past making a circular skirt			0
' @entity4 examined jewellery made by women at the female - only training centre in @entity15 this morning the duchess also met women having a cooking lesson at the centre afterwards she walked to a more public area where women are taught how to make prayer mats , jewellery and cupcakes - where she watched veiled ladies creating exquisite handmade chocolates and was even persuaded one or two - ' or three , ' she joked			1
' i never thought i would say it but i do n't think i can face any more chocolate			0
' the duchess completed her visit by viewing an exhibition space where a wide range of products made by the women - including soaps , cushions , prayer beads and abayas - are displayed and sold			1
she chatted at length with mother - of - four @entity184 , 34 , who has started @entity185 , a firm making wedding and christening decorations and gifts			2
' i just do n't know how you find the time to do all this with your family , ' she said			0
' you are truly amazing			0
' veiled @entity184 told her : ' my husband is very supportive of me and my daughters help			0
i want them to grow up knowing they can do something like this			0
the business is small but i hope it will grow			0

it has already created over 190,000 job opportunities throughout @entity3			1
prince @entity210 , meanwhile , visited the @entity211 and met with @entity108 executives involved in plans to redevelop the @entity214 and build a new rail terminal designed to absorb the enormous flow of @entity90 pilgrims travelling to and from nearby @entity218			2
the couple ’s visit to @entity3 is of huge importance to the @entity108 government in terms of diplomatic , trade and military links , but was always going to prove controversial because of the country ’s human rights record			1
their visit , which started on friday , saw them arrive at the centre of an international human rights outcry , with pressure groups calling on prince @entity210 to voice his disapproval at the controversial public execution of seven men on wednesday			1
the role of women in society has been the main theme of the duchess ¿ s visit to the country @entity4 also sampled homemade chocolates at the centre and joked she might have one , or two , or three prince @entity210 visited the @entity211 on his final day in @entity3 and met @entity211 secretary general @entity246 the victims , who had been convicted of armed robbery , died at the hands of a ‘ humane ’ firing squad as the country is , according to reports , struggling to find enough executioners to carry out traditional beheadings			1
two of the group were juveniles when they were charged before being detained for more than three years			0
all were said to have been subjected to torture in order to illicit confessions and denied legal representation in court			0
one of the men was due to be crucified after his death , with his body tied to a pole in a public square to act as a deterrent to others			0
the @entity272 has already voiced its anger with the @entity275 ’s minister for the @entity276 , @entity274 , saying : ‘ the @entity108 opposes as a matter of principle all use of the death penalty , whatever the crime committed			0
' the alleged circumstances surrounding the executions cause enormous damage to @entity3 ’s reputation internationally			1
’ @entity286 also called on @entity210 , who enjoys a close relationship with many senior members of the ruling @entity289 , to use his influence to raise the issue at the highest level			0
‘ prince @entity210 has always had the tip of his well - polished brogues in the political world and he should use his influence to tell the @entity297 a few home truths about the country ’s dreadful human rights record , ’ said @entity293 , @entity286 's @entity108 director			2
‘ surely , arriving in the wake of controversial executions and the jailing of human rights activists , @entity210 will want to at least broach these matters ? ’ although @entity307 have declined to comment publicly , diplomatic sources say @entity210 was likely to discuss reform in @entity3 with the country ’s future ruler , crown prince @entity309			1
‘ the reason why the government is keen for the prince to come here is that he enjoys a very different relationship with the @entity289 to that of the government			0
he can get things done in a way the politicians frankly ca n’t , ’ they said			0
@entity210 and @entity4 flew to @entity322 for the final leg of their tour this afternoon and were greeted by his highness @entity326 , the @entity322 minister of heritage and @entity328 @entity4 met dignitaries on arrival at @entity331 on the seventh day of a @entity276 tour @entity210 and @entity4 were welcomed by the @entity333 , @entity334 , at his palace at @entity336 @entity3 is one of five states in the world to conduct public executions and has the widest number of crimes punishable by death , including murder , rape , sodomy , robbery , theft ( after four offences ) , false prophecy and witchcraft			1
