a young @entity1 spokeswoman is responding to monday night 's self - set media fire by adding more fuel , insisting she was n't wrong to say the @entity5 administration should help jihadis from the ' @entity8 ' find jobs as a way to stop them from engaging in bloody terrorism			1
' in the longer term – and this is n't specific to @entity14 , ' @entity12 said wednesday morning on @entity15 , ' military commanders , politicians of both parties , counter-terrorism experts all agree that if you 're going to prevent terrorist groups from spreading to other places and getting more recruits , you have to look at the root causes that can lead people to extremism			1
' ' how do you get them to not pick up that @entity29 ? ' she mused			1
' you have to do all of it , you have to take them on militarily , ' @entity12 allowed , ' but you have to look at things like governance , like opportunity , so these groups are n't able to get more people to their cause			1
' on tuesday night she told a @entity40 audience that ' we can not kill every terrorist around the world , nor should we try			2
how do you get at the root causes of this ? it might be too nuanced an argument for some			2
' instead , she said , the administration should ' go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups ' – including ' lack of opportunity for jobs			1
' on @entity94 , @entity93 - era @entity92 press secretary @entity91 said @entity12 should stop talking			1
' if a deputy spokesperson for the @entity1 is the lead story for three days straight ... if the spokesman is the story , you 've got the formula wrong , ' @entity91 said during an afternoon broadcast			2
president @entity5 seemed to undermine @entity12 's argument wednesday afternoon , telling the @entity92 's ' @entity105 ' conference that ' poverty alone does n't cause somebody to become a terrorist , any more than poverty causes someone to become a criminal			1
' ' there are terrorists who come from extraordinarily wealthy backgrounds , ' @entity5 said , ' like @entity115			2
' @entity12 's series of embarrassing gaffes is reinforcing charges from @entity119 that the @entity92 for papering over religious aspects of a mass - beheading of @entity122 by the @entity124 terror army			1
jobless jihad : @entity12 had insisted monday night that a jobs program in the @entity127 could stem the tide of @entity124 ' they were @entity130 ' : pope @entity131 mourned the loss of 21 copts in @entity134 who were beheaded on video by @entity124 terrorists @entity138 surfaced on sunday showing @entity134 @entity124 sympathizers decapitating 21 @entity130 on a beach			1
@entity92 press secretary @entity141 issued a 192 - word reaction condemning the brutal killings as ' despicable ' and ' cowardly ' but made no mention of the religion of the killers or their victims			2
the words ' @entity149 , ' ' @entity148 ' and ' @entity151			0
' were not included in @entity141 's statement			0
the video itself was titled ' a message signed with blood to the @entity157			0
' the slaughtered men , clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of @entity161 detainee garb , were described as ' crusaders			0
' one of the men was seen praying just moments before his throat was slit			0
the @entity92 convened a conference with representatives from more than 60 countries on tuesday on a subject it calls ' countering violent extremism			1
' like @entity141 's statement , administration officials connected with the event have studiously avoided any mention of radical @entity148 or its animosity toward @entity130 and @entity175			2
' we are not treating these people as part of a religion , ' a senior administration official said monday during a conference call with reporters			1
' we 're treating them as terrorists			0
we call them our enemies and we ’ll be treating them as such			0
' world leaders outside of @entity188 have leapt to connect @entity124 , the self - described @entity14 , with a religious battle that pits @entity148 against the world 's other great religions			1
the 21 copts , ' were killed simply for the fact that they were @entity130 , ' @entity131 said monday at the @entity194 , speaking in his native @entity195			0
@entity196 : the five - minute @entity124 video released on sunday was captioned : ' the people of the cross , followers of the hostile @entity201 church ' ; one of the terrorists ( center ) boasted that ' safety for you crusaders is something you can only wish for ' @entity208 in @entity209 : republicans including @entity212 rep. @entity211 are growing more frustrated with a @entity92 that steadfastly refuses to frame the @entity124 battle in religious terms ' the blood of our christian brothers and sisters is a testimony which cries out to be heard			1
it makes no difference whether they be @entity222 , @entity223 , copts or @entity225			0
they are @entity130 ! ' @entity228 prime minister @entity227 said he was ' appalled by the murder of @entity130 in @entity134 , a simply barbaric and inhumane act			0
' ' our efforts to defeat the monstrosity of @entity235 extremism must not waver			0
' a @entity40 / @entity237 poll found 57 per cent of @entity78 disapprove of how president @entity5 is handling the threat posed by @entity124			1
even among @entity239 , 46 per cent say @entity78 's battle with @entity124 is going badly			1
public approval of the administration 's @entity243 efforts has slipped by 8 percentage points since september			2
part of that slide may be due to the @entity1 's focus on what conservatives deride as ' hashtag diplomacy ' – a program of pushback through social media designed to strip away @entity124 's glamorous appeal to would - be jihadis			1
the @entity257 reported monday that @entity14 is engaged in a broad effort through its @entity259 to coordinate all the government 's social media resources in response to nearly 100 @entity263 accounts blasting @entity265 recruiting messages into the @entity267 's digital ether			2
' we 're getting beaten on volume , so the only way to compete is by aggregating , curating and amplifying existing content , ' under secretary of state @entity268 told the @entity257			0
' these guys are n't @entity274 , ' @entity268 said			0
' they 're not invincible in social media			0
' but the director fo the @entity279 told a @entity281 hearing last week that ' the government is probably not the best platform to try to communicate with the set of actors who are potentially vulnerable to this kind of propaganda and this kind of recruitment			0
' ' we try to find ways to stimulate this kind of counternarrative , this kind of countermessaging , without having a @entity78 government hand in it			0

@entity12 , the @entity1 's no. 2 spokeswoman , said monday night that ' lack of opportunity for jobs ' in the @entity127 should be @entity78 focus
she refused to back down , saying the @entity5 administration is considering ' how do you get them to not pick up that @entity29 ? '
' how do you get at the root causes of this ? it might be too nuanced an argument for some , ' @entity12 insisted
' countering violent extremism ' conference *continues* in @entity188 but the @entity92 insists ' we are not treating these people as part of a religion '
@entity5 seemed to throw @entity12 under the *bus* , saying ' poverty alone does n't cause somebody to become a terrorist '
' we can not win this war by killing them , we can not kill our way out of this war , ' @entity12 had said monday night of the @entity124 terror army
