when @entity0 was given an @entity2 kit at was six - years - old , it was something of an inspiration			2
twenty years on the keen model maker has created a fleet of radio controlled warships at his workshop in @entity11 in @entity12			1
each warship is made to scale , using original @entity16 blueprints and photographs to ensure they capture a snapshot in time when the vessels were in action			1
model maker @entity0 spent the last 20 years making scale models of radio controlled navy warships			1
his @entity12 workshop features models of @entity29 ( top ) , @entity31 ( middle ) and @entity33 ( bottom ) mr @entity0 , a former plumber , uses original @entity16 blueprints to make the scale models of the warships and so dedicated is the former plumber to his craft that he is in the process of writing to the @entity41 to ask for permission to name one of his ships - a @entity46 because the original was cancelled and therefore never named			1
' you need to put in the research and i tend to pick a particular time in the ship 's life to make it at because warships went in for refits lots and could be different from year to year , ' said mr @entity0 , 63			1
' i like to make ships you do n't see at model shows very often and bigger ones are more of a challenge because you have to be more detailed			2
' mr @entity0 uses fibreglass to make the hull of the ships and flexible sheets of 1mm thick plastic for the rest of the structure			1
he researches each of the vessels before he makes them , using photographs to ensure accuracy			0
most of the other items such as guns and aircraft are made from resin and mini @entity2 kits			0
constructing the models is a painstaking process , sometimes taking longer than it took to make the actual warships themselves			2
it took nine years for mr @entity0 to complete @entity84 laying each of the planks individually replica fighter planes sit on the deck of one of mr @entity0 's boats that make up his fleet of model warships @entity29 was an @entity93 ship that was eventually transferred to the @entity16 in 1940 mr @entity0 's most recent build , the battleship @entity84 , is a 6ft long , 1:196 scale model and has as taken him nine years to finish - nine times longer than it took to build the actual warship in 1906			1
but the project was delayed by a lack of photographs of the vessel and he built two other models during that time			0
he has also made models of aircraft carrier @entity33 , @entity29 and @entity31 , the ship sunk by the @entity106 in @entity107			0
as well as his scale warships , mr @entity0 has also created replicas of tanks , keeping them all to precise scale the 63 - year - old makes the models in his @entity12 workshop and is seen consulting an original blueprint the @entity84 replica ( left ) was the most time consuming of all mr @entity0 's models and each additional part , from aircraft to weapons and fighters is made with similar attention to detail from resin or airfix kits ( right ) he is making a @entity46 - a ship that was planned but not built because a naval treaty came into place that limited the weight of warships			1
because the @entity46 was cancelled , it was never given a name , so @entity0 plans to write to the @entity41 to ask her permission to name his @entity133 , after the @entity135 admiral at the @entity136			0
@entity33 - 1:196 scale model the original @entity33 was an aircraft carrier , commissioned in february 1943 escorted @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity142 convoys also took part in a strike on a @entity106 battleship @entity31 - 7ft long , 1:1,128 scale model @entity147 was an admiral class battlecruiser warship sunk by the @entity106 during @entity107 had an overall length of 860ft @entity84 - 6ft long , 1:196 scale model took mr @entity0 nine years to finish the dreadnought was introduced in 1906 and became an important development in naval technology it was the first naval warship to have a uniform battery , rather than just a few guns he added : ' with the @entity159 i even laid the planks on the deck one by one			1
it took six months just to do the deck but it looks like the real @entity164			0
' the @entity46 was never named because it was n't built			0
some names were banded about but they were then put to other ships			0
' so i want to keep with naval tradition and write to the @entity41 to ask for permission to name it after @entity169			0
' the @entity16 do it when they name ships and i want to make things official			2
i 'll ask her if there 's something else she 'd rather i called it			0
' on average , a ship takes about three years to build and his hobby has cost mr @entity0 several thousands over the years			1
he said : ' back in the 90s , my ambition was to make a 10 - foot model and i got laughed at , but i kept making models bigger and bigger			2
' the next one i 'm going to do is nine - foot so i think i 've proved the doubters wrong			0
' mr @entity0 belongs to a model boat display team in @entity188 who stage battles with their ships and even use pyrotechnics , which means they have to have a health and safety team at the ready .			2

@entity0 has been making model warships for the last 20 years at home
mr @entity0 uses original @entity16 blueprints to make scale model ships
on average ships take three years to make but @entity84 took nine
each is made from fibreglass and flexible plastic and is radio controlled
