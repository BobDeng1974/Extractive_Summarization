members of the public could go on patrol with frontline police officers , a senior metropolitan police officer has said			1
assistant commissioner @entity5 said she wanted @entity7 police forces to adopt the @entity9 ' ride - along ' scheme , which sees people join officers on the beat			1
ms @entity5 believes confidence in the police could be improved by showing members of the public what officers do and how they make decisions			2
members of the public could go on @entity9 - style ride - alongs with frontline police officers , @entity19 assistant commissioner @entity5 said according to the @entity23 , ms @entity5 said : ' quite a few forces in the @entity25 have a ' ride - along ' programme and i have always found that a powerful idea			1
' it is quite easy to look at what the police do and pick holes in it but actually once you are alongside them on patrol and realise what they face , how they do n't know what 's coming next and how quickly they have to make decisions , it helps people understand the pressures they face			0
' the scheme was trialled in @entity47 , south - east @entity48 , earlier this week in an unmarked car earlier this week with the @entity19 hoping to offer ride - alongs each month to community members interested in policing			2
@entity53 and @entity54 and @entity55 police forces already run similar schemes , but @entity48 officers are said to have concerns over the safety of taking members of the public along with them			1
if the scheme is rolled out , people might not be able to go on patrol in their neighbourhood in case officers have to deal with anyone they know			0
there are hopes that the ride - alongs may help increase confidence in policing			2
ms @entity5 said the ride - alongs would improve public confidence in the police as members of the public would see how officers make decisions ( file picture ) the ' @entity80 ' affair , concerns about undercover officers and the inquests into the @entity85 disaster have all lowered public confidence in the police , with the number of people feeling the @entity19 in particular are doing a good job ' flat - lining ' at 68 per cent , ms @entity5 said			1
she added : ' there are individuals in communities who often for legitimate reasons have suspicions about what we do and why we do it			0
we need to work really hard to break that down and help them understand some of the issues we are dealing with			0
' we want many more people knowing and believing that the police are there for them and that they are on their side			0
' last month a report recommended that students , teachers and judges are brought on patrol with inner - city officers .			0
