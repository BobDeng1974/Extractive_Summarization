by @entity0 last updated at 2:25 pm on 23rd august 2011 ' unfounded ' : planning minister @entity1 hit back at the @entity4 's @entity3 concerns @entity4 has become locked in a war of words with a planning minister over the charity 's ' risible ' claims that @entity3 land will be threatened by @entity11 planning reforms			1
conservative mp @entity1 accused the charity of ' nihilistic selfishness ' after the trust dared to voice concerns over ' damaging development in undesignated countryside '			1
the planning minister branded the @entity4 's claims as ' unfounded ' in arguing that new houses are needed to solve the housebuilding ' crisis ' and help young people onto the property ladder			1
mr @entity26 comments came after the trust revealed its ' grave concerns ' over the @entity11 's draft @entity30 published last month			1
@entity4 's director - general dame @entity31 said the proposed changes could ' lead to unchecked and damaging development in the undesignated countryside on a scale not seen since the 1930s '			2
she argued that the reforms focused too heavily on stimulating economic growth meaning that far more developments would be approved			2
but mr @entity1 responded by saying the government 's position had been misrepresented			2
he added that those who sought to ' preserve in aspic ' their towns were guilty of ' nihilistic selfishness '			2
in an interview with the @entity47 , he said : ' the principal campaigning point seems to be the loss of the @entity3			1
' there is nothing in the policy that would lead to a significant loss of @entity3			1
' @entity4 had on their website an aerial shot of @entity56 in some risible idea that this was the future of @entity58			2
' mr @entity1 insisted that @entity3 , national parks and areas of special scientific interest in this country would remain protected			1
under threat : @entity4 claimed @entity3 areas similar to this one in @entity65 , @entity66 , could be subject to ' damaging development ' vision of the future : mr @entity1 claimed the @entity4 used a picture of urban sprawl in @entity56 to depict how @entity58 could look in years to come the mp added that the only way in which new homes would be built on @entity3 land would be under a new ' community right to build ' scheme , allowing small developments of up to 12 homes to be built if supported by 90 % of locals			1
he added : ' if you can square a village voting for 10 new homes for its parishioners with the sprawl of @entity88 or @entity89 , i fail to see it			0
' the proposed streamlining of planning rules surrounding new developments aims to reduce the current 1,300 pages of national planning policy to just 52			0
the @entity96 has also spoken out against the planned changes			0
opposed : @entity4 had voiced ' grave concerns ' on their website about the @entity11 's draft @entity30 councils will be told there should be a ' presumption for development ' when they write their local planning strategies			0
mr @entity1 added : ' last year was the lowest level of housebuilding since @entity108 , which means the problem is getting worse and worse causing more misery for more people for as long as this is n't addressed			0
' people do have an interest in the future - to not care shows a degree of nihilistic selfishness which is quite rare			0
' a spokesman for the @entity119 said that the @entity3 will not be threatened by the proposed changes			1
' we have made our commitment to the @entity3 crystal clear			1
it is in the @entity125 , and our proposed abolition of the unpopular regional strategies through the @entity128 will stop the top - down pressure to remove the @entity3 in 30 areas across @entity131 , ' said the spokesman			1
a @entity4 spokesman hit back at the planning minister , saying : ' @entity1 and his colleagues at @entity119 seem to think that greenbelts and other designated areas of countryside are all that anyone cares about			0
' they are not , as the government should have realised from the forestry debacle earlier this year			0
we 've not even mentioned them as part of our campaign			0
' our primary concern is what the government 's reforms threaten to do to the everyday places in and around cities , towns and villages that are hugely valued by local communities			1
' to say we have a nihilistic view on housing is equally odd			0
we have developed hundreds of homes ourselves and have existing permission to build hundreds more on land that we own			0
' we believe strongly that any development must meet the needs of people , the environment as well as the economy			0
' the government has failed to do this in its reforms			2
it has put short - term financial gain ahead of everything else			0
' it has failed to protect the everyday places that local communities love			1
it has given the power in planning to the already powerful			0
' whilst the government is making warm noises about local communities , in practice the dice are heavily loaded to favour development and local people simply wo n't get enough say			2

charity *criticised* for ' unfounded ' @entity3 claims
trust responds by claiming @entity178 ' failed to protect everyday places communities love '
