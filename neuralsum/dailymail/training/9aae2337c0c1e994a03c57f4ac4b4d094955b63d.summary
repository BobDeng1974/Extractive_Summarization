by @entity0 a retired @entity2 agent has become the longest - held @entity4 hostage in history , more than six years after he was kidnapped in @entity6			1
@entity7 , 65 , has now been held for exactly 2,455 days - one day more than @entity4 journalist @entity8 who was released by his @entity6 - backed @entity10 captors in 1991 , according to the @entity2			1
@entity11 , who left the bureau in 1998 , was working as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling on the @entity6 island of @entity16 - a hotbed for organised crime - when he vanished in 2007			1
the last his family heard of him was in 2011 when they were sent video and photos of him an anonymous email sparking fears the @entity6 intelligence services may be behind his abduction			1
this undated handout photo provided by the family of @entity7 , shows retired - @entity2 agent @entity7 , 64 , dressed as a @entity30 detainee longest - serving hostage : @entity11 has now been held for exactly 2,455 days - one day more than @entity4 journalist @entity8 ( pictured ) who was released by his @entity6 - backed @entity10 captors in 1991 the photographs were released by the family to renew public interest in the case and come two years after a hostage video and photographs of retired @entity2 agent @entity7 raised the possibility that the missing @entity4 was being held by terrorists			1
@entity11 , a private investigator , disappeared in 2007 on the @entity6 island of @entity16			1
the @entity6 government has repeatedly denied knowing anything about his disappearance , and the disturbing video and photos that @entity11 ’s family received in late 2010 and early 2011 seemed to give credence to the idea			1
retired @entity2 agent @entity7 ( pictured far left ) with his family in @entity51 , @entity52 the extraordinary photos — showing @entity11 ’s hair wild and gray , his beard long and unkempt — are being seen for the first time publicly after the family provided copies to the @entity60 the video has been previously released			1
in response to @entity6 ’s repeated denials , and amid secret conversations with @entity6 ’s government , secretary of state @entity62 said in a statement in march 2011 that @entity11 was being held somewhere in @entity68			1
the implication was that @entity11 might be in the hands of terrorist group or criminal organization somewhere in @entity73 or @entity74			0
the statement was a goodwill gesture to @entity6 , one that the @entity4 hoped would prod @entity76 to help bring him home			1
a progression of images released by the @entity2 which shows the aging and hair growth of retired @entity2 agent @entity7 from before his kidnap in 2007 ( 1st left ) to the first image released of him in 2009 to a more recent @entity87 2011 image of the hostage @entity11 retired from the @entity2 in 1998 and became a private investigator			1
he was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007 , and his family has said that took him to the @entity6 island of @entity16 , where he was last seen two years later , with the investigation stalled , the consensus now among some @entity4 officials involved in the case is that despite years of denials , @entity6 ’s intelligence service was almost certainly behind the 54 - second video and five photographs of @entity11 that were emailed anonymously to his family			1
the level of expertise used to send those items was too good , indicating professional spies were behind them , the officials said , speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were n’t authorized to talk publicly			0
while everything dealing with @entity6 is murky , their conclusion is based on the @entity4 government ’s best intelligence analysis			1
the photos , for example , portray @entity11 in an orange jumpsuit like those worn by detainees at the @entity4 prison at @entity30			0
the family received them via email in april 2011			0
in each photo , he held a sign bearing a different message			0
retired @entity2 agent @entity7 with three of his daughters in @entity51 in @entity52 before his disappearance ' i am here in @entity30 , ' one said			2
' do you know where it is ? ' another read : ' this is the result of 30 years serving for @entity4			0
' @entity6 president @entity138 has personally and repeatedly criticized the @entity4 over its detention facility at @entity30			2
@entity4 operatives in @entity74 managed to trace the cellphone used to send the photographs , officials said			0
but the owner had nothing to do with the photos , and the trail went cold			0
it was that way , too , with the hostage video the family received			0
it was sent from a cyber cafe in @entity73 in november 2010			0
the video depicted a haggard @entity11 , who said he was being held by a ' group			0
' in the background , @entity157 wedding music can be heard			0
@entity7 with one of his grandchildren before his disappearance in 2007 on an @entity6 resort island investigating cigarette smuggling the @entity157 people live primarily in @entity73 and @entity74 , just across @entity6 ’s eastern border			1
yet the sender left no clues to his identity and never used that email address again			0
whoever was behind the photos and video was no amateur , @entity4 authorities concluded			0
they made no mistakes , leading investigators to conclude it had to be a professional intelligence service like @entity6 ’s @entity180			2
@entity11 ’s wife , @entity181 , provided the photos to @entity60 because she felt her husband ’s disappearance was not getting the attention it deserves from the government			2
' there is n’t any pressure on @entity6 to resolve this , ' she said			2
' it ’s been much too long			0
' though @entity4 diplomats and the @entity2 have tried behind the scenes to find @entity11 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , and bring him home , both presidents @entity195 and @entity196 have said little about his case and have applied little public pressure on @entity6 for more information about @entity11 ’s whereabouts			1
@entity11 has watched more public pressure result in @entity6 ’s release of a trio of hikers , a journalist named @entity206 and a team of @entity209 sailors captured by the @entity210			2
everyone has come home except her husband			0
@entity215 ’s quiet diplomacy , meanwhile , has yielded scant results beyond the @entity6 president ’s promise to help find @entity11			2
' we assumed there would be some kind of follow - up and we did n’t get any , ' @entity11 said			0
' after those pictures came , we received nothing			0
' in one meeting between the two countries , the @entity6 told the @entity4 that they were looking for @entity11 and were conducting raids in @entity229 , a mountainous region that includes parts of @entity73 , @entity6 and @entity74 , @entity4 officials said			2
but the @entity4 ultimately concluded that the @entity6 made up the story			2
there were no raids , and officials determined that the episode was a ruse by @entity6 counterintelligence to learn how @entity4 intelligence agencies work			2
an expert on @entity241 organized crime , @entity11 retired from the @entity2 in 1998 and became a private investigator			1
he was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007 , and his family has said that took him to the @entity6 island of @entity16 , where he was last seen			1
@entity16 is a popular resort area and a hotbed of smuggling and organized crime			1
it is also a free trade zone , meaning @entity4 citizens do not need visas to travel there .			0
