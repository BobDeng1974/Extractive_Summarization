in spite of this uncertain start , @entity1 was determined to be rich			1

controversy : @entity1 once said he pushed a man off a cliff before saying it was a ' load of hogwash ' cooked up because he was ' drunk ' bon vivant @entity1 once said he killed a man by pushing him off the edge of a cliff only later to say he was ' completely drunk'when he made the claim			1
during a boozy lunch in 2008 he said the man , who he refused to name , was murdered by him ' about 25 years ago '			0
' i killed him , ' mr @entity1 told interviewer @entity240 from @entity241 at his @entity70 mansion , adding : ' that 's all you need to know			1
' the victim had supposedly made the life of a woman @entity1 knew ' a living misery ... he beat her up , beat up her kids , would n't let her alone , kept on			1
' so the @entity4 - born @entity1 , one of the 100 richest people in @entity92 , said he ' had a little meeting '' with the man			2
' he hurt her and i told him to stop and he kept on , ' the publisher of @entity25 , @entity24 and @entity255 magazines went on			0

' do n't matter where it was			0
he would n't let her alone			0
she told him to stop			0
i told him to stop			0
many people told him to stop			0
' when this tubby , belligerent man was asked by the interviewer : ' does everyone know you 've killed a man ? ' he replied : ' no , and they 'll never find out , either			0
' ' anybody who harms one of mine , ' he went on , ' better know what they 're doing			0
and they 'd always be warned			0
i would n't attack anyone without reason			0
' but if they keep harming one of mine , then i have no option , ' he concluded , seemingly without a moment of remorse or contrition			0
indeed , over the course of the five - hour interview , the flamboyant businessman repeated his admission			0
it was only the following day that @entity1 sent @entity240 an e-mail thanking her for an enjoyable afternoon but also suggesting that she , ' should forget one particular episode i recounted to you after the third or fourth bottle of wine in the conservatory '			2
he subsequently told ms @entity240 that the murder story had been ' a load of hogwash - i was drunk			0
i withdraw it unconditionally '			0
he later said he had been unwell and taking drugs which not have been mixed with alcohol and his spokesman said his story was untrue and ' absolutely ridiculous '			0
