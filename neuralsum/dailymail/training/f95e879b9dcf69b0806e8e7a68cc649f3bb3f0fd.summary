wasps are bracing themselves for protests from angry supporters on sunday as the club play their first match since the controversial announcement that they will be moving to @entity7			1
the former @entity9 club confirmed on wednesday they will leave @entity10 in @entity11 — where they have resided for the past 12 years — and move to the @entity12 in december after a multi-million purchase backed by car manufacturer @entity14			1
many fans of @entity0 , who host @entity16 on sunday , are furious at the decision to relocate 80 miles north , despite promises of free coach journeys from @entity11 for future home games			1
@entity0 ' @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 during the announcement of a new stadium and sponsor ' obviously we 're expecting a mixed reaction			1
moving is not a decision we 've taken lightly and we 'd like supporters to come on this journey with us , ' said @entity22 , @entity0 director of rugby			2
' moving will safeguard the future of @entity0 and hopefully put @entity0 back up there competing with the best in @entity34 and @entity35			2
' this was the only decision we could take if @entity0 are to be about in the years ahead			0
the alternative does n't bear thinking about ' i fail to see how any supporter would rather see their club go bust than move , although i understand their initial disappointment			0
' we want to assure fans that we have looked at every option and have n't taken this decision likely			0
we totally value their support			0
' @entity22 , director of rugby at @entity0 talks to the press after the announcement of the move of gravest concern to fans has been the lack of consultation over the move and the location of the new home away from @entity0 ' traditional roots in @entity9 and the south east			1
' hopefully when the emotion dies down , people will take a breath and look at the reality , ' @entity22 said			0
' and the reality is : do you want your club to be about in 20 or 50 years time , or do you want your club to go out of business ? ' i appreciate it has been an emotional week for many supporters , but i hope we can all channel those emotions into supporting the team on the field			0
