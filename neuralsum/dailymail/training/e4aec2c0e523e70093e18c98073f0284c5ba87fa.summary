invading country after country at lightning speed , @entity1 's army had @entity5 terrified during @entity6			2
but , as a @entity10 soldier 's letter has revealed , it was n't just the @entity12 's fiery rhetoric which had his troops wired			2
military doctors were handing out millions of pills to the troops known as @entity17			1
the label claimed it was an ' alertness aid ' which should be taken ' to maintain wakefulness '			1
we know it today as methamphetamine , or more commonly , crystal meth			1
high hitler : @entity10 troops , pictured in occupied @entity26 , were given an ' aid ' to keep them alert which was actually crystal meth powerful : @entity29 troops popped pills of @entity17 - a drug which we know today as crystal meth more than 200million pills were dolled out to the @entity34 and @entity35 between 1939 and 1945			1
@entity29 soldiers nicknamed it ' @entity38 ' - meaning ' tank chocolate '			1
junkies : even @entity1 himself took intravenous methamphetamine in @entity44 , newspapers reported how the enemy was using a ' miracle pill			0
' even @entity1 himself was given intravenous methamphetamine by his physician @entity49			0
but the reality for many @entity10 soldiers and pilots was the nightmare of an horrific drug addiction			1
although the stimulant allowed soldiers to maintain long periods of activity , the side - effects were serious			1
they included dizziness , sweats , depression and hallucinations			0
there were soldiers who died of heart failure and others who shot themselves during psychotic phases			2
in light of this , some doctors remained uneasy about giving out the drug			2
even @entity74 , the @entity10 's top health official , wanted to limit its use , but was ultimately unsuccessful			0
in may 1940 , a young soldier named @entity77 wrote a letter from the frontline back to his family complaining that he was exhausted by the war			2
he said he had become ' cold and apathetic , completely without interests '			0
he asked his family ' perhaps you could obtain some more @entity17 for my supplies ? ' @entity77 explained that just one pill was as effective for staying alert as litres of strong coffee			1
better still , the drug seemed to make all his worries disappear and , for a few hours at least , he was happy			2
@entity91 would later go on to become one of @entity29 's most famous postwar writers and won the @entity94 in 1972			0
millions of @entity17 pills were handed out to @entity10 troops to help them maintain ' wakefulness ' the @entity98 also experimented with a number of other drugs which have remain popular among recreational users today			1
research by the @entity29 @entity103 also showed they developed a cocaine - based stimulant for its front - line fighters that was tested on concentration camp inmates			2
@entity29 literary great @entity77 wrote to his family about his need for more supplies of @entity17 during the war ' it was @entity1 's last secret weapon to win a war he had already lost long ago , ' said criminologist @entity114 , author of a @entity29 language book on the @entity10 's use of drugs called nazis on speed			1
the drug , codenamed @entity121 , was tested at the @entity123 concentration camp north of @entity124 , where prisoners loaded with 45lb packs were reported to have marched 70 miles without rest			2
the plan was to give all soldiers in the crumbling @entity10 the wonder drug - but the invasion of @entity132 in june 1944 , coupled with crippling @entity134 bombing , scotched the scheme			1
' the @entity136 was fuelled by speed , ' said a pharmacologist			0
' the idea was to turn ordinary soldiers , sailors and airmen into automatons capable of superhuman performance			0
' @entity145 , a military doctor and director of the @entity148 at @entity124 's @entity149 , was behind the @entity17 scheme			1
he found that the drug gave users heightened self - confidence and self - awareness			1
on the eastern front , where the fighting was the most savage of the war , soldiers used it in massive quantities against an enemy that showed no mercy			2
in january 1942 , one group of 500 troops surrounded by the @entity166 were attempting to escape in temperatures of minus 30 degrees @entity168 ' i decided to give them @entity17 as they began to lie down in the snow wanting to die , ' wrote the medical officer for the unit			1
' after half an hour the men began spontaneously reporting that they felt better			0
' they began marching in orderly fashion again , their spirits improved , and they became more alert			0
' methamphetamine is a highly - addictive , powerful form of the drug speed			1
in its crystalline form it is known as crystal meth			1
it is usually smocked in a pipe , in the same way as crack cocaine , but can also be eaten , snorted or injected			0
the drug as stimulant and induces a feeling of prolonged euphoria which can last for hours			0
other effects include increased alertness , excessive sweating and loss of appetite			0
it is an illegal class a drug			0
the maximum penalty for possession is seven years in prison but for supply it can be life			0
as well as crystal meth , @entity10 scientists took a keen interest in a number of other drugs which have since become popular recreational substances			1
an experimental drug codenamed @entity121 was based around cocaine and was found to give soldiers increased levels of endurance			2
nazi doctors hoped to mass produce the drug and hand it out to troops in 1944 but the war ended before they could execute the plan			1
research has also suggested that they experimented with the hallucinogenic lsd as a form of mind control			0
@entity10 scientists believed it could be used to enhance memory , control behaviour and help with interrogations			0
until recently , it was also believed that the @entity29 pharmaceutical company @entity227 developed ecstasy to suppress the appetites of soldiers in @entity231			0
but in 2006 the company trawled through its archives and claimed records showed it was synthesized by scientist @entity235 in an effort to develop a medicine to prevent blood clots .			0

said it would help soldiers maintain ' wakefulness '
