former vice president @entity0 laid into president @entity1 and his administration today for failing to recognize sooner the perils of allowing the @entity4 to thrive in @entity5 and @entity6			1
' a realistic strategy has to recognize that @entity8 is a grave strategic threat to the @entity10 , ' @entity0 said during a speech on national security in @entity13 on wednesday morning			1
the current situation is ' dire , ' he said , and it ' one of the most dangerous we have faced certainly in my lifetime , and far more dangerous than the administration has been willing to admit			0
' ' our president must understand that we are at war and we must do what it takes for as long as it takes to win , ' the former @entity28 administration official said			1
during his remarks at the right - leaning @entity35 referred to the @entity37 extremists as ' terrorists ' and said that defeating them would ' require immediate , sustained simultaneous action across multiple fronts			0
' ' we must move globally to get back on offense in the @entity44 , ' he said			0
' this means first recognizing and admitting the size and scope of the threat we face			0
' @entity0 said the @entity10 must provide more substantially more military trainers , special operations forces , intelligence and air power to @entity5 and @entity54 forces , and the military must immediately strike @entity8 command centers , staging areas and lines of communication , regardless of where they are			1
' @entity8 does recognize a border between @entity6 and @entity5 , so neither should we , ' @entity0 said			1
previewing @entity1 's address to the nation tonight , @entity0 said that ' we can hope for and we should look for signs of a bold and immediate strategy to defeat @entity8 , ' but that would be a ' departure ' from @entity1 's past actions			1
' so often @entity1 responds to crises by saying what he will not do , ' @entity0 said			2
' we can only hope that pattern will end tonight			0
' instead of throwing around threats like his ' meaningless red line ' in @entity6 , the president needs to make clear to trouble makers that misbehavior will be met with military action , @entity0 said			1
foes of @entity10 in @entity6 and @entity79 ' are not impressed ' with @entity1 's tough talk , he said , and they 're ignoring his warnings			2
the president 's claims that @entity85 's recent behavior belongs to 19th century is also laughable , @entity0 said			1
' they play a rough game over there , and they do n't much care to which century we ascribe their conduct , ' @entity0 cautioned			2
in @entity85 , he said , the only concern is , can we get away with it ? if so , end of of discussion			0
the former vice president said foreign friends often wonder why @entity1 is ' withdrawing @entity10 leadership just when it was needed most ' in the world			1
@entity1 needs to accept that @entity10 as the leader of the free world for the sake of it 's allies who ' know that their security relies on @entity10 power , @entity0 said			1
the former congressman , and later vice president , moved back to his native state of @entity112 after leaving office but regularly travels to @entity13 to speak at events			2
president @entity1 , seen through an @entity117 window , speaks on the phone with @entity119 of the @entity120 at the @entity121			0
@entity1 is preparing to deliver a speech on the @entity4 to the nation this evening yesterday , he returned to his old stopping grounds on @entity125 to impart his wisdom on congressional @entity127			0
a @entity129 article described the atmosphere as ' warm , ' and the @entity129 said @entity0 received a ' rapturous reception			2
' it noted that two libertarian members of the @entity127 caucus did n't appear to be as taken with @entity0 as their colleagues , though			2
@entity137 and @entity138 indicated to the @entity129 that they were none too thrilled with @entity0 's calls for aggressive military action to combat terrorist threats			0
' his worldview is that we should be in countries around the world and have armed forces everywhere -- and most @entity127 do nâ€™t agree with that , ' @entity138 said			0
libertarians are known for their more dovish stance on military intervention while @entity0 , who was an architect of the @entity5 war and @entity28 's @entity44 , takes an extremely hawkish approach			1
@entity0 responded to @entity138 's critique on wednesday , saying that those who believe the @entity10 should put itself on an isolationist course are ' dead wrong			1
' while a few @entity127 members disagreed with his perspective on foreign policy , the meet - up was otherwise a success , @entity0 said			0
' it was a great reception			0
' ' they never treated me that way when i was vice president , ' he teased , eliciting laughter from the audience .			0
