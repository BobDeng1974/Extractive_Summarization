by @entity0 published : 08:09 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 19:32 est , 20 april 2012 a couple who were told it would be ‘ virtually impossible ’ for them to conceive have had a baby with the help of a pioneering @entity7 technique – an incubator with built - in @entity9			1
@entity10 and @entity11 spent four years trying for a child before tests revealed that surgery mr @entity11 had as a child had left him with a very low sperm count			1
the ‘ heartbroken ’ couple turned to @entity7 – and a revolutionary device called the @entity19 , which increases the chances of pregnancy by up to 50 per cent			1
first in line : @entity10 and @entity11 said the incubator may have helped them conceive on their first @entity7 cycle the £ 100,000 machine , which looks like a microwave , mimics conditions in the womb to provide the perfect controlled environment for fertilisation			2
the development of the embryos is monitored via @entity9 , stopping the laboratory staff from having to remove them from the incubator to check on their progress , which can have a detrimental effect			2
mrs @entity40 , 27 , said : ‘ when the chance of having a family is ripped away from you , it is the worst thing imaginable			2
‘ we were heartbroken and felt such a failure			2
we had got married , bought our first house and now wanted a family			2
’ fortunately , the couple ’s first cycle of @entity7 in july , paid for by the @entity51 , was a success			0
their daughter @entity53 arrived three weeks ago weighing 6lb 2oz – one of the first babies to be born as a result of the new technique			0
mrs @entity40 , a trainee teacher from @entity59 , added : ‘ we feel so privileged to be @entity53 ’s mum and dad			0
modern technology : @entity63 looks at the time - lapse video created by the @entity19 the odds were stacked against us and we really feared it would never happen			1
' but amazingly it worked first time and we are sure this new machine helped			0
she beat the odds and is our little miracle			0
' mrs @entity40 and her husband , 33 , a software engineer , had treatment at @entity75 in @entity76 , which is the first fertility clinic in the @entity78 to use the @entity19			1
the machine , which was developed by @entity81 company @entity80 and recently gained approval from the @entity83 for clinical use in the @entity85 , has a built - in microscope and camera system to allow round - the - clock monitoring of the embryos			0
@entity90 with baby @entity53 : the care clinic says the facility has boosted their pregnancy success rate by 44 per cent each one can be tracked until it is ready to be put into the mother ’s womb , between three and five days after fertilisation			1
@entity98 , head of embryology at @entity75 , said : ' currently , assessment of embryos in @entity7 is limited to brief snapshot glimpses at defined time points , usually one per day involving removal from the incubator			0
' with the @entity19 , images are taken every few minutes and viewed as time - lapse video by the embryologists until the point of embryo transfer without removing them from incubation , usually three or five days later			1
' the ability to study these images in a closed system allows us to select the most viable embryo for transfer into the patient , and exclude embryos that are not ideal for implantation			0
' in @entity123 and mrs @entity40 ’s case , only two of the six embryos created were deemed suitable for implantation			0
@entity126 presented at the @entity128 conference in @entity129 earlier this year showed that the @entity19 increases the chances of pregnancy by an average of 44 per cent compared with a standard incubator .			1

another *74* women are pregnant thanks to the @entity19 used at a @entity76 clinic
