by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 19:09 est , 2 april 2013 with a baby on the way , it is the perfect royal retreat - large , leafy and discreet			1
this is the @entity6 bolthole reportedly earmarked for parents - to - be the @entity8 and @entity9 , just a stone ’s throw from the @entity13 ’s own private residence at @entity14			1
as revealed in the @entity16 last month , royal aides have been given planning permission to begin extensive improvements at @entity19			1
plans : @entity19 will have a raft of changes to accommodate the @entity8 and @entity9 and their growing family , including a new 16ft x 16ft garden room and the planting of trees and shrubs the royal couple will have more privacy once changes have been made to their charming country house these include a new garden room and a pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for plants to trail through , providing both shade and privacy on the patio area			1
more importantly , however , @entity40 have also given the @entity13 , who is the @entity42 mansion ’s landlord , approval to re-route its existing driveway and plant dozens of new trees and shrubs to shield it from prying eyes			1
the ten - bedroom property is one of 150 situated on the monarch ’s 20,000 - acre @entity14 in @entity6 and is only two miles east of @entity14 , one of her favourite private residences			1
the hall , which largely dates back to 1802 , was used as an illicit bolt - hole by @entity58 and the then @entity59 during their long - running affair when it was rented by the prince ’s friend @entity62			0
prince @entity64 , who is close to the @entity65 ’ children , is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to the hall as a child			0
it also has something of a royal pedigree having been leased to the @entity8 and @entity73 as their country house from 1972 until 1990			2
its current tenant is businessman @entity76 , who runs a kitchen worktop business from the grounds and has leased the property until 2017			2
it is likely he will be asked to move out early in order to carry out the necessary building works in time for the couple to move in , meaning the @entity13 may have to compensate him			2
the detailed planning application for @entity19 , described as a ‘ major development ’ in council papers , can not be seen on the council website for security reasons and anyone wishing to view them has to be vetted by police			0
prince @entity64 and @entity9 will live just two miles from where the @entity93 celebrate @entity95 the @entity13 has gifted the couple a stunning mansion council officers approved the plans under delegated powers , which means they did not have to go through the usual council planning process			1
according to the application an existing wood store will be converted into extra accommodation - mostly likely for police officers guarding the property - while a garage block will be transformed into an equipment room			2
other plans involve moving the main gates to the property further down a lane so members of the public will not be able to get so close to the house			0
the new , longer private driveway will sweep across an existing field , currently used as grazing land , before reaching the front of the house , which has its own swimming pool and tennis court			0
a new gate will be built across what is currently a public road and a lawn taken out to create extra parking space			0
the current public entrance to nearby @entity128 will become accessible only to the @entity8 and @entity9 , with the approach road re-routed to create a new entrance for worshippers			0
to compensate them the @entity13 will pay for a new car park to be built			0
although both @entity136 and @entity137 ’s palaces have refused to comment on the plans , it has emerged this week that the new pergola and garden room will be designed by architect @entity141 , who was behind a controversial extension for @entity58 at his own country home			1
mr @entity141 , whose ancestors were responsible for building the @entity146 , built the @entity147 at @entity148 in @entity149 , which is used by @entity58 for entertaining but has been described as a ‘ @entity151 house ’			0
the @entity14 has been owned by the @entity13 since her accession in 1952 and by the @entity93 since 1862			0
although much of the land is open to the public , the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the royal family relaxing there , making it even more attractive to the @entity8 and @entity9 .			1
