some will feel the scene is rather seedy			0
a barefoot young man partying on board a yacht grasps a plastic cocktail glass in one hand and the nozzle of a shisha , or hookah , pipe with the other , holding it to his mouth			1
the young man is prince @entity13 , who , even at 30 , has failed to shed his worrying habit of presenting the world with inappropriate images of the @entity17 at play			1
a picture of him sucking on the shisha on a yacht — hired for a lavish party by a @entity24 branch of @entity27 nightclub @entity25 — has this week been winging its way round the world			1
his antics on board the yacht in @entity38 ’s @entity37 last friday show even at 30 he is presenting the world with inappropriate images of the @entity17 at play			1
he ended his undignified weekend leaving a club at almost dawn the colourful scene took place in @entity38 ’s @entity37 last friday , two days before the @entity47 season ’s final @entity45 was held in the emirate			1
@entity13 attended the race on sunday , and when @entity51 driver @entity50 was crowned @entity52 , he was publicly hailed by the prince — in notably unregal style — as a ‘ legend ’			1
that evening @entity13 was to be found ‘ twerking ’ in a nightclub , which he did n’t leave until nearly dawn			1
all in all , a somewhat undignified weekend			0
the problem for the @entity53 is that everywhere he goes these days , people brandish their smart phones to snap him			1
at one point , @entity13 smiled for a photo with his arm round @entity66 r&b singer @entity65			1
despite the presence of camera phones , one @entity51 onlooker aboard ‘ @entity68 ’ — as the yacht was christened by the @entity73 - based nightclub , which @entity13 ’s friend @entity74 helped promote — says the @entity53 was drawing on the hookah pipe ‘ in full view of everyone ’ for a good 15 minutes			1
there is nothing illegal about the shisha , of course , but was n’t it both foolish and irresponsible for the prince to use one publicly ? the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) has been campaigning vigorously against the mushrooming of shisha bars around @entity51 because of their grave health risks to users			0
though it originated in the @entity90 and @entity91 , the pipe ’s mix of tobacco and fruit flavours is becoming dangerously popular with youthful users , who say it makes them feel ‘ mellow ’			0
onlookers aboard the yacht in @entity37 said prince @entity13 , pictured here at the @entity100 on sunday in the @entity102 country , was drawing on the hookah pipe ‘ in full view of everyone ’ for a good 15 minutes so @entity13 may receive a sharp reprimand from his grandfather , non-smoking prince @entity106 , who has been patron of the @entity84 since its inception 53 years ago			1
as professor @entity109 , the foundation ’s medical director , says : ‘ there is a worrying misconception that smoking shisha is not harmful to your health			1
but strip away the fruity flavours and you ’re left with the same toxic and addictive substances as cigarettes , including tar , nicotine , arsenic and lead			0
’ the @entity84 points out that in one puff from a shisha , a user inhales the same amount of smoke as from an entire cigarette			0
using it for 15 minutes , as @entity13 did , is equivalent to smoking 25 cigarettes			1
@entity13 , pictured speaking to drivers before the @entity38 @entity132 at @entity37 on sunday , may receive a reprimand from his grandfather , prince @entity106 , a patron of the @entity84 that did not deter @entity13 — a heavy smoker like his great - grandfather @entity136 , who was just 56 when he died of lung cancer			1
conscious of the efforts by health professionals to persuade the public to stop smoking , @entity13 does his best to be seen as little as possible in public with a cigarette in his hand			1
but in the heady atmosphere of @entity25 his caution evaporated , even though last friday ’s event was anything but a private party			1
anyone could come aboard if they bought a £ 150 ticket , and when word got round that the @entity53 was on board , they certainly did			1
for @entity13 , the @entity38 trip was the wind - down after a three - day official visit to the @entity160 state of @entity161 , where he played in a charity polo match — raising almost £ 800,000 for his @entity165 children ’s charity , @entity166			1
‘ by the time he arrived in @entity38 , he wanted to let his hair down and have a bit of fun , ’ says a friend of the prince			1
‘ but poor @entity13 has to be so careful these days			1
’ not careful enough , it seems , as social media rapidly became awash with reports of the partying @entity53 , wisecracking intimately with a group of young women			2
for @entity13 , the @entity38 trip was a wind - down after a three - day official visit to the @entity160 state of @entity161 , where he played in a charity polo match — raising almost £ 800,000 for his @entity165 children ’s charity , @entity166 of course , there were young women involved the last time @entity13 ’s social life attracted such attention			1
two years ago , he went to @entity184 and played a sleazy game called ‘ strip billiards ’ with a group of girls he met in the lobby of his hotel and invited up to his room			0
before you could say @entity195 , the picture of @entity13 wearing nothing but an @entity199 necklace and bracelets was all over the internet and published in a certain red - top newspaper			2
how pathetic it sounded when one of his advisers complained he ’d been the victim of ‘ a nasty betrayal by a girl , who pretended she was on her phone , took a picture , and sent it to her boyfriend ’			0
it seemed that @entity13 had grown up after his antics two years ago when he went to @entity184 and played a sleazy game called ‘ strip billiards ’ with a group of girls he invited from a hotel lobby up to his five - star room since then , it seemed that @entity13 had grown up			2
and it must be said that his informal , mischievous style has worked wonders for the @entity17 ’s staid image			0
he is entitled to praise for creating the @entity222 for injured ex-servicemen , and joining wounded soldiers on a trek to the @entity226			0
but he remains accident - prone , as well as naively trusting of strangers			0
did he really think no one would photograph him sucking on a shisha in public ? two days after the @entity232 party , the @entity53 watched the @entity45 from the @entity234 team garage , and after @entity50 crossed the line , @entity13 came on the team radio to applaud the @entity51 driver , telling him : ‘ you are an absolute legend			1
’ after that , @entity13 made it known he was ‘ ready for a really big night out ’			2
and he was certainly in the right company to find it , in the shape of @entity246 rugby player @entity245 , who used to date mezza - soprano @entity247			0
prince @entity13 , pictured chatting to drivers at the @entity250 , remains accident - prone , as well as naively trusting of strangers			2
did he think no one would photograph him sucking a shisha in public ? the 38 - year - old rugby player - turned - stockbroker has been a friend of the prince for five years and accompanied him on his notorious trip to @entity184			0
intriguingly , the police protection officer who accompanied @entity13 to @entity38 was also pictured next to him in a jacuzzi on his @entity184 jaunt — suggesting that even after the furore over the naked pictures , @entity13 and royal security bosses are happy with the arrangement			1
he was likely to have been with him on sunday at the @entity272 nightclub , the usual after - race watering hole for the @entity47 racing fraternity , where a table costs a mere £ 12,000			1
@entity50 and his girlfriend , former x factor judge @entity273 , were there , but only briefly			0
they did n’t stay long enough to see @entity13 merrily ‘ twerking ’ on the dance floor			2
nor was @entity13 in any hurry to leave			2
it was 5am before he slipped out of the club and headed straight for the airport to catch his flight back to @entity73			0
‘ there were loads of pretty girls throwing themselves at him , ’ says a fellow partygoer			0
‘ @entity13 was having a great time			2
the man has stamina — he was partying hard			0
’ one observer tweeted : ‘ ca n’t believe i just seen prince @entity13 twerking and i did n’t record it			2
what a guy ! ! ! ’ what puzzles many is how @entity13 , an army officer , appears to be able to spend quite so much time on social manoeuvres			2
but after two tours in @entity300 , his duties are now mainly ceremonial : organising events like the @entity222 , being involved in the formal side of state visits and in contingency planning for civil disasters			0
the @entity306 refuses to say how many hours he spends at his office in @entity73 but insists he has ‘ a unique role ’			0
the truth is that since breaking up with @entity310 , @entity13 has been footloose			2
certainly , the @entity311 would like to see him settle down and start a family , just as @entity313 has			0
indeed , an intriguing closeness has been developing between @entity13 and his grandmother , with whom he has private meetings at the @entity317			2
‘ she will often clear her diary when she knows he wants to drop in and see her , ’ says a senior aide			0
‘ she recognises that he is the most popular member of the @entity17 , and is always interested in hearing what he has to say			0
and he ’s very anxious not to let her down			0
’ with that in mind , perhaps he ought to think twice next time he finds himself offered a hookah pipe .			0
