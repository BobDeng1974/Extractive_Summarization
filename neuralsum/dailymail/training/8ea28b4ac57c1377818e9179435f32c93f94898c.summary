by @entity0 , political correspondent stressed : parents and carers - who already have the right to ask for flexible working - could lose out to those with less pressing responsibilities @entity7 's 30million workers will have the right to demand flexible hours from monday – even if they just want a lie - in or time off to pursue a hobby			1
they will not have to give a reason why they want to be off at certain times and companies have been told they can not judge requests on merit			1
it means parents and carers – who already have the right to ask for flexible working – could lose out to those with less pressing responsibilities			2
a request from a mother who wants to start work later so she can take her children to nursery will carry no more weight than one from a colleague simply wanting to spend a bit longer in bed			0
bosses expect to be hit with a deluge of requests which must be considered in the order received			1
astonishingly , government officials have told business groups that if employers receive conflicting requests which they can not honour they should ‘ put the names in a hat ’			1
@entity41 , director of policy at the @entity43 , said the new rules meant that those with stronger claims to flexible working could lose out			2
he said : ‘ the new rules make it harder for employers to prioritise requests			1
they can not prioritise one employee over another , whereas before you could prioritise those who had childcare responsibilities or carer responsibilities for example			0
’ when the measures were first announced by @entity57 in november 2012 , businesses warned they would lead to more red tape			0
many firms already offer flexible terms , but there are fears that the new rules could lead to a string of legal actions			2
there are also concerns that the ‘ right to ask ’ for flexible working will be confused with a ‘ right to have ’			2
@entity69 , chief executive of the @entity70 , said : ‘ our members recognise the benefits of flexible working and wherever possible have sought to work with employees to provide flexible working options			2
‘ however , extending the right to request flexible working to all employees will simply make the consideration process the employer needs to follow more complicated and time - consuming and only add to the administrative pressures already felt by many small business owners			1
’ flexible working laws were first introduced in 2003			0
currently they mean firms must consider requests from parents with children under 17 and from those with caring responsibilities for elderly parents or other dependents			0
@entity95 business minister @entity94 , pictured said extending the right to request flexible working will help to create a shift towards more modern workplaces but from monday , all workers will have the same ‘ right to ask ’ after they have been in a job for six months			1
they can make one request a year and businesses can only refuse under eight specific reasons , such as if the change creates additional costs or does not fit with customer @entity108 who are unhappy with the decision can appeal			0
@entity95 business minister @entity94 said : ‘ extending the right to request flexible working will help to create a cultural shift towards more modern , 21st century workplaces where working flexibly is the norm			1
‘ firms that embrace flexible working are more likely to attract and retain the best talent and reap the benefits of a more motivated workforce			0
‘ employees will benefit from being able to balance work with other commitments in their lives			0
it also helps drive a cultural shift where flexible working becomes the norm			0
