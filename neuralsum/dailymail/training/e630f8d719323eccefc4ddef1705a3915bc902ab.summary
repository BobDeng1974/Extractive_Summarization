by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:15 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 05:26 est , 31 october 2013 most people want to ‘ end their days ’ living in a bungalow , @entity3 minister @entity2 has claimed			1
the planning minister suggested ‘ people love ’ single - storey homes , and wants to encourage developers to build more of them			1
but he admitted that , because they took up more space , more land would be needed for developments to meet demand			1
retirement : the majority of pensioners would like to ' end their days ' in a bungalow , the government 's planning minister has claimed it is thought more single - storey houses would persuade older people to downsize , freeing up more family homes and kick - starting the housing market			0
bungalow account for just one in 50 of all properties across the country , and four years ago just 300 bungalows were built in the @entity32			1
mr @entity2 suggested that developments that included bungalows instead of standard houses or apartments could escape opposition from people living nearby			1
‘ bungalows , we have built far too few			2
every opinion poll , you ask people where they would like to end their days they all say they all say , not all but a lot of them , that they want to end their days in a bungalow , ’ he told the @entity48 in @entity50 conference last week			0
‘ if we ’re going to provide for more bungalows we ’re going to have to provide more land than we otherwise would			2
‘ now some of you will be happy to do that and others will say actually that ’s just impossible in our circumstance , and therefore we ’re going to create apartment buildings			0
’ planning minister @entity2 said most people ' love ' bungalows and would not object to them being built near them retro : ministers want a return to the sort of bungalows showcased at the @entity73 1963 like this @entity74 ministers have previously been urged to encourage more bungalows to stimulate the housing market older people who are reluctant to move out of family homes , even when children have moved away , could be persuaded to downsize to bungalows as a preferred way of living			1
mr @entity2 added : ‘ bungalows are not a universal panacea , but they are very popular and therefore if you have land in your neighbourhoods and you propose to allocate it specifically to bungalows i think you ’ll find that those site allocations are some of the more popular ones that you make			1
’ in april the @entity94 think tank called for planning rules to be torn up to encourage developers to move away from tiny box flats to investing in low level living			0
it called for councils to lose control over granting planning permission , instead allowing local people to decide what can and can not be built in their town or village			1
residents could be more willing to support a wave of new bungalows , because they are less likely to impact on views			0
bungalows were popular in the 1970s , but fell out of fashion as developers rushed to build blocks of flats the @entity94 report added : ‘ if thirty per cent of people ’s ideal home is a bungalow , and this preference is even stronger for older people , it make no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock			2
‘ older people currently living in large family homes might want to downsize to a bungalow , which is smaller and easier to maintain , as well as being on one floor and offering outside space			0
‘ there are huge numbers of spare rooms in homes older people are currently living in			0
what are needed are the homes that older people like and so would like to move into			0
‘ but planning policy prevents these homes from being built – and this is before we even begin to discuss the fact that higher land prices caused by our planning system would in any case mitigate against building bungalows			2

@entity2 says people ' love ' bungalows and called for more to be built
admitted they take up more space , so more land will be needed
popularity means local people will not object to developments
just 2 *%* of properties are now bungalows despite ageing population
