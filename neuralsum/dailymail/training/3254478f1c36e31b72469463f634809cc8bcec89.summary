today 's bidders had 1,200 lots of mistletoe , 3,000 wreaths and 250 @entity28 trees to bid for today , despite this year 's crop being threatened by poor weather and affecting some of the foliage			1

pucker up : couples traditionally enjoy a kiss under the mistletoe at this time of year it 's not certain where the tradition of kissing under the mistletoe actually originates but its connection to @entity28 is likely to have something to do with the druids			1

it was also believed to help both animals and humans become more fertile			0
each year , druids held a special ceremony in late december or early january where they would take mistletoe from oak trees and give it to people to put in their homes to stave off evil spirits			1
it is said to have become part of @entity28 tradition in the @entity144 era thanks to an historical fascination with druids			2

it is also said to have been believed at one stage that kissing under the mistletoe would lead to marriage			0
