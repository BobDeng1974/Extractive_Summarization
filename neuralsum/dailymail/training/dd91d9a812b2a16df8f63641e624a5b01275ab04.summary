by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 18 november 2013 not impressed : veteran critic @entity1 wonders what @entity2 would think after a night on the sofa he has cast his critical eye over numerous @entity7 turkeys during his distinguished career as a film reviewer			1
but none , it would appear , come close to @entity1 ’s dismal verdict on today ’s tv adverts			1
the 80 - year - old veteran critic has launched a wide - ranging attack on the ‘ worrisome ’ television advertisements currently aimed at viewers , hitting out at everything from the slew of irresponsible gambling and no win , no fee compensation commercials , to a @entity24 advert which features young women swooning over older men			1
in an amusing but scathing article in this week ’s @entity28 , mr @entity1 said if aliens were to descend on earth and settle down for a session in front of a tv , they would probably report back to @entity35 that there is no need to invade judging by the poor quality of adverts			1
he said : ‘ it ’s [ tv adverts ] full of vain , greedy , irresponsible people constantly looking for a fast buck			1
oh , and if we do invade , whatever you do keep away from the young women – trust me , you really do n’t want to go near them			1
’ speaking in the @entity28 , the veteran critic used the example of recent advertisements for @entity52 incontinence pads , claiming they humiliated women			1
he said : ‘ some of the most worrisome ads are on daytime tv			1
‘ there was the one in which a beautiful young woman in a purple dress gets her skirt caught in the closing doors of a lift and scrabbles desperately to retain her modesty while the man she has just met and fancied looks on with amusement			1
‘ in a sequel the girl , still wearing the same dress and now accompanied by the fancied man , falls out of a taxi , this time revealing her knickers			1
‘ @entity73 , what humiliation but no , hang on , it ’s okay – because in both instances beneath those knickers she ’s wearing an incontinence pad			1
she may well have wet herself but , such is the efficacy of the pad , the boyfriend will never know			1
‘ what puzzles me about all this is the advertiser ’s apparent conviction that young women today have absolutely no control over their bladders			2
if so this is surely a matter of grave concern			2
these women should n’t be buying grown - up nappies ; they should be seeking urgent consultations with their gps			2
’ baffling : one advert shows a lady with bladder incontinence fall out of a taxi , flashing her underwear to a date ... ... but thanks to this purchase , he will never know			2
surely , @entity1 says , she should really be seeking medical help ? he added : ‘ even more worrying , though , is the proliferation of commercials for personal injury lawyers , again mostly to be found on daytime telly			2
oh dear , you fell over in the street while blind drunk and bumped your nose ? well , somebody ’s got to pay for that because you ’re not responsible , are you ? nobody can be expected to be responsible for their own actions these days			2
‘ so lose no time in contacting ambulance - chasers’r’us.com and we ’ll make sure somebody coughs up compensation			2
no win , no fee			2
and the fee if you do win ? ah , that ’s not mentioned			2
@entity126 would have had a load of fun with these guys			0
’ while he admitted that many adverts left him confused and often unsure of what product they were promoting , he said other were more sinister			0
worrying : personal injury lawyer adverts persuade viewers that any slight tumble is someone else 's fault our screens are cluttered with actors falling over as other actors earnestly urge us to demand money he said : ‘ perhaps most disturbing of all are the gambling commercials , which make betting look glamorous and surely appeal most strongly to the poorest and most desperate among us			1
‘ there ’s one in which a good - looking young couple are so eager to watch the telly and see how to lose all their money that they vault over the back of their settee , the more quickly to study the many ways in which they can gamble their life savings away			0
‘ even the @entity159 gets in on the gambling fever by showing the results of the national lottery at a peak hour , just to remind you that here is yet another , ostensibly more respectable , way to get rid of your money			1
’ @entity1 presented @entity171 ’s @entity170 programme from 1972 until 1998 , when he eventually handed over to @entity172 before moving to @entity24			0
he has now also admitting to being left ‘ bothered ’ by a number of other adverts , two of which shows a young female apparently aroused by older men			0
absurd : stars like @entity180 are enlisted to star in big - budget commercials promoting gambling cashing in : @entity1 also takes a stab at the @entity159 for glamorising betting via the lottery every week he said : ‘ there were the two urging us to subscribe to @entity24 that end with either a dressing - gowned @entity188 or an equally dressing - gowned @entity189 walking off with a sexually excited girl young enough to be their daughter or even their granddaughter			1
‘ what ’s that all about ? whether it sells much in the way of @entity24 i have no idea ; the strongest message i receive seems to be that old blokes can still pull young girls but , if you ask me , more fool them if they want to			0
‘ then there are the cosmetics ads , particularly those for miracle creams that instantly remove all wrinkles			0
‘ these end with the models , faces softer and smoother than babies ’ bottoms , smiling happily at the camera			0
mind you , in most cases they look to be about 19 and might reasonably be supposed not to have had wrinkles in the first place			0
nevertheless , once the cream has done its stuff they are unquestionably wrinkle - free			0
honoured : @entity1 , pictured here with his wife and daughters in 1998 , was awarded a @entity223 for his work ‘ i wonder what a visitor from @entity35 , settling down for a session in front of the telly , would make of all this and of us			0
i daresay he ’d phone home saying : “ look , i do n’t think we should bother invading @entity234			0
‘ it ’s full of vain , greedy , irresponsible people constantly looking for a fast buck			0
oh , and if we do invade , whatever you do keep away from the young women – trust me , you really do n’t want to go near them			0
’ @entity1 was the face of the @entity159 ’s film series for more than 20 years			1
he left in 1998 to become a film critic at @entity24 , on @entity1 ’s @entity245			1
he has also written 10 novels			0
he was awarded the @entity250 ’s @entity249 in 1980 , @entity247 in 1990 and a cbe in 1998			0
he married wife @entity251 , a former journalist and author , in 1957			0
the pair had two daughters before she died in 2011 at the age of 77 .			0

*martians* would be baffled by a night of @entity260 tv , he tells @entity28
veteran critic is amusing but scathing in his attack on misplaced *priorities*
he also takes aim at the @entity159 for using the @entity268 to glamorise gambling
