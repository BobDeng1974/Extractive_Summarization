in telly terms , the @entity0 has had quite - what they like to call in the trade - a ' journey ’ this season			1
this weekend saw its tv channel sidekicks deliver a double header with a new ally to help set the scene			2
this no doubt will have the purists , and perhaps even some fans of the four teams involved , spitting at the very mention			2
but with @entity17 on board for both games , i doubt the @entity20 and @entity21 will have minded presenting their coverage from @entity23			1
however , on saturday evening , @entity24 was dead sheepish about it in the @entity20 ’s on - site studio			2
‘ i do n’t like semi finals at @entity17 ’ , said @entity27 squirming awkwardly in his seat at the prospect of it			1
well , some twenty four hour or so later , @entity17 was certainly delighted to host them			1
@entity34 players celebrate during the victory over @entity36 which saw the @entity37 reach the @entity0 final @entity39 ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring against @entity42 at @entity17 @entity17 was a great setting for this weekend 's two @entity0 semi-final clashes prior to that first clash on saturday between @entity34 and @entity36 , there had also been disgruntled talk from inside the @entity48			1
this time about the fact the match clashed with the big @entity52 game between @entity53 and @entity54			2
yes , over on @entity56 , you could have witnessed business as usual at @entity58			2
with a first half that @entity60 at one point described as ‘ difficult to watch ’			0
if you were n’t watching @entity53 's victory , what you could see instead was what turned out to be a genuine sporting event , a real footballing occasion			0
alongside @entity24 , the extremely engaging @entity67 hoped his old club @entity36 would n’t treat their premature trip to north west @entity70 as ‘ a day out ' and believed there was a chance the @entity36 could win against @entity34			1
well , they most certainly set aside the chance for some selfies and instead contributed wholly to a cracking game of football			0
a clash that was bursting out of the telly screen with atmosphere as the sun soaked some thrilling football and the crowd generated a groundswell of excitement			0
@entity36 , pictured celebrating after @entity87 's goal , contributed to a great encounter on saturday what ’s more , there were also a couple of errors that led to two memorable moments in the coverage			0
firstly , when a film about the infamous 1990 @entity97 failed , @entity95 was left with a spare few minutes to fill			0
which he did with a great chat about his guests ' @entity101 memories			0
‘ it ’s a wonderful experience , winning an @entity0 , is n’t it @entity27 ? ’ , observed @entity95 before turning to the distinctly pot free @entity104			1
‘ do n’t start again , @entity95 ! ’ , barked @entity107 , his brief annoyance serving only to make the moment even funnier for his fellow ex pros			0
and then there was @entity36 ’s @entity112			0
i was amazed at the end of the game when the director went through the familiar montage of close ups , and while doing so chose to cut away from manager @entity119 beginning to console his crestfallen keeper			0
a few minutes later , they did decide to show it , though			0
i almost wished they had n’t as it was nearly too harrowing to watch the poor fella ’s suffering			0
nevertheless it was compelling stuff , and helped seal that first semi final as something a bit special			2
@entity36 goalkeeper @entity112 ( centre ) is consoled by @entity36 boss @entity119 after the final whistle come sunday , and the man who would be drawing the camera ’s unblinking gaze was this time established right from the get go			2
as soon as @entity139 was announced in the starting line up , there was no doubt which player was going to be at the heart of @entity21 ’s story			0
although it was n’t all about the outgoing captain			0
they opened their coverage with a lovely little film in which two young fans - @entity152 ’s @entity151 and @entity42 ’s @entity153 ( naturally ! ) - recreated each team ’s cup runs in their back gardens			1
we then saw the two young stars walking up @entity17 way together , helping to remind us about the supporter ’s part in the occasion			1
this was reiterated with a pre-match lap of the pitch by host @entity165 and his pundits which really drew those of us at home into the moment			0
it also enabled us to hear the @entity152 fans give @entity173 a , shall we say , robust welcome as he approached their end ! former @entity176 midfielder @entity173 ( right ) received a robust welcome from the @entity152 faithful from the moment we first saw @entity139 trotting out onto the pitch to warm up , right up until the moment commentator @entity182 exclaimed ‘ off the line , @entity139 ’s header ’ , the outgoing skipper was very rarely far from the centre of attention			1
come the final whistle , the @entity42 captain was clearly reluctant to be			1
it was something @entity190 handled very cleverly by using their inset box innovation to show the on pitch interview with @entity193 @entity39 as the main shot showed @entity139 sullenly leaving the @entity17 turf for possibly the last time			1
yet another moment that made @entity17 the ideal setting for an @entity0 semi-final tv audience to enjoy even more magic from this season ’s tournament ? i ’ll leave that thought with you			1
much of the attention was on @entity42 captain @entity139 during sunday 's semi-final clash on @entity21			1

@entity17 hosted two @entity0 semi-finals over the weekend
@entity34 *defeated* @entity211 2 - 1 after *extra-time* to reach final
@entity39 and @entity214 scored as @entity152 beat @entity42
