' jurors heard that after he was arrested and questioned , a voice recognition expert was able to match @entity2 ’s voice and @entity18 accent in the recorded interview to that of the caller on the call centre logs			1
the court heard from @entity9 ' head of security @entity111 who was on duty when the note was found on october 15th and said : ' we could n’t take risks with peoples lives			0
