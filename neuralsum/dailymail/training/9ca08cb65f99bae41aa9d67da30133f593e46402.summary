by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 10 april 2013 girlguiding @entity1 is supporting a petition to abolish @entity5 newspaper 's long - running topless model feature on page three			1
after @entity8 hinted he might be ending the slot , girl guide members aged 16 to 25 voted overwhelmingly to sign the the ' @entity11 ' campaign , with 88 per cent of respondents agreeing the paper should call time on the provocative editorial that has been running since 1970			1
the campaign itself - which has already accrued some 90,000 signatures - was launched during the @entity19 last summer , when writer @entity20 noticed that the largest female image in @entity5 was of a young woman showing her breasts , even though heptathlete @entity24 had just won her gold medal			1
tops on , please : girlguiding @entity1 has given its support to the no more page 3 campaign , asking @entity5 to call time on its topless model feature the decision to hold a vote on the campaign was taken by @entity34 's advocates - our panel of young women aged between 14 and 25 who are the driving force behind @entity34 's advocacy work			1
explaining their decision to support the campaign , the @entity40 said : ' @entity5 is a family newspaper			1
anyone can pick it up , turn to @entity47 , and think that it is normal for young women to be treated as objects			2
' it is impossible to nurture your ambitions if you are constantly told that you are n't the same as your male equivalent			2
it is disrespectful and embarrassing			2
we need to get used to the idea that women are not for sale			2
' the guides said : ' @entity5 is a family newspaper			2
anyone can pick it up , turn to @entity47 , and think that it is normal for young women to be treated as objects			0
this is just wrong ' campaign pressure : @entity70 , the writer behind @entity11 , poses in her campaign t - shirt , left , and @entity8 's suggestive tweet that he is considering ending the feature , right the organisation added : ' @entity34 believes passionately in giving girls a voice on issues that they care about			1
we would like all our young members to have the opportunity to speak out publicly and to add their voices to campaigns affecting the lives of girls			0
' take the @entity84 we are asking @entity85 to drop the bare boobs from @entity5 newspaper			1
we are asking very nicely			0
@entity89 does n't say , ' and now let 's look at @entity91 , 21 , from @entity93 's bare breasts , ' in the middle of the @entity95 , does he , @entity85 ? @entity96 and @entity97 do n't flash up pictures of @entity99 , 19 , from @entity100 , in just her pants and a necklace , on this morning , do they , @entity85 ? no , they do n't			2
there would be an outcry			0
and you should n't show the naked breasts of young women in your widely read ' family ' newspaper either			0
consider this a long overdue outcry			0
@entity85 , stop showing topless pictures of young women in @entity1 's most widely read newspaper , stop conditioning your readers to view women as sex objects			1
the campaign commented : ' no more page 3 are absolutely thrilled that the @entity123 's young members have voted to support our campaign to bring an end to the most iconic piece of sexism in our national press			1
' we have heard too many stories of how @entity47 negatively impacts young women and girls ; either because of boys ' reactions to it or girls ' own feelings about their bodies and self - worth caused by being presented with such narrow definitions of beauty on a daily basis			0
' as we have at least one former guiding member within the team , we know firsthand what a powerful and positive influence guiding can have on individual girls			0
' @entity8 , chief executive of @entity148 who own @entity5 , suggested abolishiing page 3 in an off - the - cuff remark on @entity152			1
the @entity154 media mogul responded to a tweet about ditching the feature , saying : ' @entity47 so last century ! you maybe right , do n't know but considering			0
perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas			0
' writing in the @entity160 , @entity20 , who was sexually assaulted in her 20s , explained her reasons for launching the petition : ' as one of our change.org petition signatures says , " boobs are n't news "			2
indeed , so why are they in the newspaper ? ' well , they are in the newspaper because in 1970 a group of men , in a male managed media , in a male run country decided to put them there			0
' possibly they did n't think how women would feel about being represented like this , nor did it occur to them that women read newspapers			0
' the page 3 girl image is there for no other reason than the sexual gratification of men			1
she â€™s a sex object			0
' but when figures range from 300,000 women being sexually assaulted and 60,000 raped each year , to 1 in 4 who have been sexually assaulted , is it wise to be repeatedly perpetuating a notion that women are sexual objects ? ' to sign the no more page 3 petition click here .			1
