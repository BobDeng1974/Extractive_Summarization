by @entity0 created 3:06 pm on 27th july 2011 this is the luxury @entity2 villa @entity4 is renting for his first ‘ proper ’ foreign holiday since becoming prime minister			1
the @entity7 will leave the @entity8 soon for a fortnight in the lush @entity11 hills after @entity12 discovered the rustic 18th century villa on a holiday website			1
the region was until recently a favourite holiday destination of @entity17 , and ‘ @entity18 ’ was regularly under fire for accepting free stays in villas			1
water lovely place : the villa in @entity2 that is rumoured to be the holiday destination of @entity4 and his family overlooking the garden : one of the swish double bedrooms rooms with views : the villa nestles among the stunning @entity2 countryside @entity33 aides were yesterday keen to stress the @entity7 will be paying the market rate for their holiday			1
they are flying out on a budget airline and are sharing the grand 11,000 - euro - a - week mansion on the @entity38 with two families who are old friends			2
the @entity7 ’ third share of the bill comes to £ 5,800			2
@entity2 holds a special place in their heart as it is where the couple first laid eyes on each other during a holiday in 1992			2
tusc the job : the villa is tastefully decorated throughout with antique furnishings dining in style : where the party will eat indoors plenty of holiday books : the well - stocked reading room situated near the town of @entity61 , the @entity38 is in the heart of the @entity64 region , so popular with @entity8 holidaymakers it has been dubbed ‘ @entity67 ’ , and it is also close to the city of @entity69 - the name given to their youngest daughter			1
she was born last year while the @entity7 were on an ‘ austerity ’ staycation in @entity75			2
this year , aides have told the prime minister he has done enough to show he is tightening his belt in the wake of the economic downturn , and can eschew the ‘ hair shirt ’ @entity8 summer holiday in favour of getting away from it all for a fortnight in the @entity87 sun. time off : @entity4 and @entity90 holiday in @entity91 in may in another break from the @entity93 years , mr @entity4 will not be meeting @entity94 , the troubled @entity11 prime minister who became friends with @entity96 and @entity97			1
last night a @entity4 friend said firmly : ‘ this is a holiday , not a work trip			2
’ earlier this year , @entity4 treated his wife to a weekend in @entity102 , @entity103 , for her 40th birthday , and the whole family have enjoyed short trips to @entity107 in @entity75 and the @entity103 holiday island @entity91 – where mrs @entity90 attended a rave - style nightclub			1
in @entity2 , the prime minister ’s party will have free run of the entire villa , which sleeps 19 people and has several bathrooms			1
the 300 - year - old property has its own private garden , swimming pool and tennis court and is surrounded by high walls and tall cypress trees ensuring total security			2
musician @entity123 and his wife @entity125 own a luxurious former hunting lodge nearby , and the estate even featured in @entity129 ’s cookbook ‘ @entity134 ’ , in which the television chef was photographed making pasta with @entity132 , one of the housekeepers			2
inside , the villa is decorated with antique furniture , crystal chandeliers , marble bathrooms , state - of - the - art tv and a full - size billiard table , as well as antique and contemporary paintings			2
it is surrounded by lush working vineyards and olive groves , as well as oak woods which contain roaming wild boar , and there are also fishing lakes on the estate			0
getaway : @entity17 and his family pose for a photocall during their stay in @entity2 in august 1998 the estate produces organic wine , olive oil , salami and honey , and @entity160 and @entity161 , who run it , can organise @entity2 cooking lessons in the villa ’s spacious kitchen			1
reviews of the estate on the @entity169 website are mainly positive , with one recent guest describing it as simply ‘ amazing ’			0
but pitfalls of choosing an old house were identified by another reviewer , from @entity175 , who reported ‘ several problems while we were there : fridge door falling off , leaking showers , loos that would n’t flush properly ’			0
the owners said these problems had since been fixed			0
when the @entity183 visited the area , they stayed with @entity11 aristocrat @entity185			1
during one free stay on an estate near @entity188 , mr @entity17 was accused by locals of being a ‘ scrounger ’ after he left a paltry tip during a dinner at a restaurant			1
in the middle of 1992 , mr @entity4 met his wife in @entity2 when she came on their family holiday because she was a friend of @entity4 ’s sister @entity198			1
the @entity7 were celebrating @entity4 and @entity198 ’s parents ’ 30th wedding anniversary			0
according to his biographers , mr @entity4 set his sights on @entity12 and they played tennis together			0
mr @entity4 - despite being a competitive player - took pains not to humiliate her			0
winning the match was clearly not his aim , and when they were back in @entity210 , they went on their first date at @entity213 restaurant			0
yesterday @entity214 , who owns the @entity38 with his mother @entity215 , said : ‘ we have known for a few months they were coming here but had been asked to keep it quiet			0
‘ it was booked via an agency and i can assure them that they will have a lovely , relaxing time here			0
‘ they have exclusive use of a pool and tennis courts and there is some beautiful countryside as well as the historic cities of @entity69 and @entity232 nearby			0
‘ we have an extensive wine cellar here , as that is primarily what we do here - make wine - and i would be delighted to show him our vineyards and our collection			0
‘ we also have a group of ladies who can cook traditional @entity2 lunches and dinners if they so wish			0
’ a @entity33 spokesman said : ‘ we never comment on the prime minister ’s movements			1
’ during the pm ’s absence , and with deputy prime minister @entity250 already on holiday in @entity103 with his family , foreign secretary @entity248 will be left as the most senior cabinet minister in the @entity8			1
but @entity254 insists that mr @entity4 is always in charge and able to keep up with ‘ the details of government ’ even when on holiday			0
