both parish and the teen decided to leave a comment on @entity13 's post : ' @entity13 , i do n't know what to say			1
i am not good with words like you are and the way you express yourself			0
all i can say is i am crying like at the end of @entity155 ... you make me feel so special … thank you for this letter			2
it made my day and i will keep it close to my heart always			0
' to my daughter ’s @entity18 i never wanted you here			1
you simply were never part of the plan			0
growing up and dreaming of my family i never included you			0
i did n’t want help from another woman to raise my child			2
the plan was for my family to include me , daddy and our children , not you			0
i doubt you ever wanted me in your life			2
i doubt you planned to mother a child that you did n’t give birth to			2
i can bet that your plan for your family included you , daddy and your children together , not me or my daughter			2
i can almost bet that when you dreamed of becoming a mother it would be the day you gave birth and not the day you married your husband			2
i ’m pretty sure you never planned on me being here			0
but @entity185 has plans that far exceed our own and when my little family dissolved to form two families i knew you would be coming			2
in my mind you would be a terrible beast and my daughter would not want you to mother her at all , ever ! i was hoping that you would be semi unattractive and prayed my daughter would n’t look up to you			1
her daddy would know that he was settling for second best			0
@entity194 swirled in me because i never wanted to face the fact that another woman would mother my child in my absence			1
when i first met you i ’ll admit you were n’t what i had in mind and a twinge of jealousy shot through my body			0
you were supposed to be hideous , remember ? but you were n’t , you were stunningly beautiful			0
you were supposed to be a mean old hag , remember ? but you were n’t , you were a young , sweet woman			2
i realized by the look on your face that meeting me was just as hard as it was for me to meet you			0
dang your kind smile ! i was planing on really hating you			0
why are your ruining my plan ? ! i wanted to resent you but you made it impossible and i quickly grew thankful for you			1
you ’ve accepted our daughter from the very start and have unconditionally loved both her and her daddy , that ’s a true gift to all of us			2
you ’ve included our daughter in everything you do and make her feel loved and accepted			2
you put her relationship with her daddy above yours and only a brave and courageous woman knows how to do that with such grace			2
i knew when her daddy and i decided to divorce and live in separate homes there would be times when she would need me , her mommy , and i would n’t be there			0
i ’m so thankful that you are there in my absence			2
i ’m grateful that you have mercy on her teen years and never reject her			0
she needs a mommy at your house and you ’ve done an amazing job being that for her			0
you ’ve respected my position as mom from the very start			0
i appreciate that you always check with me when you question if you are making the right decision with her			0
i know our situation is rare			0
it ’s not often that a mom and stepmom text each other to remind each other that they love and respect each other			1
because of you and your courage to mother our daughter the way that you do , she will be a better woman			1
she will grow up with more love than i could have ever imagined			2
it was n’t her choice to have divorced parents and even though i would n’t wish that on any child i am so thankful that she now has 4 parents who love and respect her and each other			1
she ’s compassionate because of it and understands that a failure in one area can turn into a blessing in another			0
i do n’t see you as a fill in for when i ’m not there			0
you are her mother when she ’s with you and when she ’s with me			0
she ’s excited to call you and tell you her stories when she ’s at my house and that makes my heart want to jump from my chest with joy			0
i fill with pride when you wrap your arms around me and squeeze for a genuine and loving hug each time we see each other			0
i am extremely aware of what it looks like when a mother can not emotionally accept her childs stepmother in their life			1
@entity297 pours heavily from me that we are able to rise above anything like that and do what is truly right for ourdaughter			0
thank you for being mature enough and respectful enough to co-parent with me			0
i promise to always respect your input for our daughter			1
i promise to never lessen the position you hold in her life or make you feel like you are not her mother			0
i promise to raise her to be grateful to have two strong and brave women in her life that have the courage to mother her together			0
even though our situation is peaceful i pray that she is never in it , but if she ever finds herself here i promise to set an example for her of what co-parenting should look like			0
precious woman , you are a rare and beautiful gem			0
@entity185 bless you and i love you .			0
