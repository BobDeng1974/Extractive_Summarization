by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 02:07 est , 22 april 2013 keeping on : @entity1 poses in december 2011 with a picture of her murdered son , @entity3 the parents of murdered teenager @entity5 have vowed never to give up their quest for justice ahead of today ’s 20th anniversary of his stabbing			1
@entity1 and @entity11 were united in their message as they tried to gather strength to mark his appalling racist killing			1
although 4,500 miles apart – one will attend a memorial service in @entity18 , the other will take flowers to @entity3 ’s grave in @entity21 – they defiantly insisted they have not given up hope that one day all his killers will face justice			1
mrs @entity1 vowed to hold the head of @entity26 to account over his recent pledge not to close the investigation , while her former husband said he believes detectives could yet nail all those responsible			1
in january last year , two of the original five suspects accused by the @entity35 of murdering @entity3 in @entity36 , south - east @entity18 , in 1993 were convicted of his killing after a forensic breakthrough			1
drug trafficker @entity5 , 37 , and gangster ’s son @entity5 , 36 , were jailed for life for their role in the murder			1
but three of the other prime suspects named by the @entity35 in its famous front page in february 1997 – brothers @entity44 and @entity48 and their friend @entity49 , who all still live in south - east @entity18 – continue to evade justice			1
senior political figures and @entity53 chief sir @entity52 are among the @entity54 due at a memorial service for @entity3 in @entity18 today			1
@entity56 said last night : ‘ the senseless killing of @entity5 in 1993 was a tragedy			1
killed : @entity5 , 18 , an aspiring architect , was stabbed to death by a group of five or six racist thugs - all white youths - as he waited for a bus in @entity36 , south - east @entity18 , on 22 april , 1993 ' it was also a moment that sparked monumental change in our society – change that has been brought about by the tireless efforts of @entity3 ’s family in challenging the police , @entity70 and society to examine themselves and ask difficult questions			1
’ in an article for the @entity35 , home secretary @entity73 says : ‘ @entity3 ’s murder became a catalyst for a drastic , and sometimes agonised , reappraisal of the police ’s approach to racist crime			1
' today , it is almost inconceivable that a black woman whose son had been murdered would be treated in the way @entity1 was in 1993			1
’ in an interview with the @entity35 , mrs @entity1 , 60 , conceded that @entity26 ’s inquiry into her son ’s murder can not go on indefinitely but said the time for it to be shelved had not yet arrived			1
‘ jailed : in january last year , two of the original five suspects accused by the @entity35 of murdering @entity3 - drug trafficker @entity5 ( left ) , 37 , and gangster 's son @entity5 ( right ) , 36 , were convicted of his killing just after the court case last year , there were rumours that certain officers felt that they had gone as far as they could go			1
named : @entity44 ( pictured ) and @entity48 and their friend @entity49 continue to evade justice ‘ i think at the time i questioned that			1
because i feel that , yes , evidence is now difficult to come by after 20 years and you need that to convict the other three			2
‘ but i do n’t think they should give up and the fact that the @entity109 is saying that is good			2
’ mr @entity5 , 71 , who will say a prayer at his son ’s grave in @entity21 with a pastor friend who has flown from @entity115 , is equally determined that police continue their investigation			1
‘ it took us nearly 20 years to get this result [ guilty verdicts ] , ’ he said			2
‘ i do not know if i am going to live another 20 years but i have not given up			0
i think that all those people who told me to give up do not understand the nature of love			0
’ mr @entity5 – who split from @entity3 ’s mother in 1999 – suggested someone might confess or provide vital information			1
@entity3 , 18 , an aspiring architect , was stabbed to death by a group of five or six racist thugs – all white youths – as he waited for a bus in @entity36 on 22 april , 1993			1
last month @entity5 dropped his appeal against his conviction , a move seen by yard chiefs as an admission of guilt			1
but mrs @entity1 said she doubts whether he will ever publicly admit his guilt			2
looking ahead to today ’s memorial service , she said : ‘ i have been feeling very low recently			2
‘ it is difficult to believe it is 20 years since i saw my son , 20 years of speaking out against racism , 20 years of challenging the police , challenging the government			0
' but one of the things i have always said is that @entity3 deserved better			2
he did not deserve what happened to him			0
’ mrs @entity1 said that , in her opinion , the police are still racist and she accused the government of not doing enough on the issue of racism			2

fifteen years ago : @entity162 is pictured ( front ) in 1998 at a public inquiry into @entity5 's death in the 20 years since the ghastly murder of @entity5 , policing in @entity168 has been transformed			1
that is in large part due to the unstinting efforts of @entity1 , @entity3 ’s mother , who has pushed and pressured the authorities relentlessly and effectively – first to get the @entity53 ’s initial inquiry into @entity3 ’s murder reviewed , and then to improve the way @entity168 ’s police handle and investigate racist killings			1
@entity3 ’s murder became a catalyst for a drastic , and sometimes agonised , reappraisal of the police ’s approach to racist crime			1
the @entity5 identified the @entity53 as ‘ institutionally racist ’ , and triggered very significant changes in police practice			2
today , it is almost inconceivable that a black woman whose son had been murdered would be treated in the way @entity1 was in 1993			1
the police are more sensitive to race issues than they used to be			0
the toleration of racist banter that used to be such an offensive and depressing characteristic of many police canteens has diminished			0
no one who cares about policing in @entity168 can be complacent			0
there are no grounds for thinking everything is fine and dandy , because it is n’t			0
there are still racist officers it is being replaced by the realisation that no officer with racist attitudes can expect to remain in the force			0
the surveys of black and ethnic minority opinion show that confidence amongst those communities in the police is at a significantly higher level than it used to be in the bad old days			0
but no one who cares about policing in @entity168 can be complacent			0
there are no grounds for thinking everything is fine and dandy , because it is n’t			0
there are still racist officers			0
there are also officers who unconsciously treat those whose race is different to their own in unacceptable ways			0
though their number is diminishing , there is still a great deal to do before we achieve a police force that is recognised by everyone as treating all members of our community fairly			0
i believe that the way this government has restructured policing will help that progress to be achieved			0
we have replaced diktats from the centre with local control : police and @entity244 , directly elected by local people , now set your local force ’s priorities - and if those priorities do not match yours , for instance because they do not do enough to ensure that the police treat everyone fairly , then you can hold them to account and vote for a @entity252 who will do so			0
we have established the @entity253 to set professional standards for all officers , and to ensure that every new recruit , and indeed every experienced detective or bobby on the beat , understands and respects those standards			0
every force needs to build trust and confidence , and to secure greater co-operation from ethnic minority communities every force needs to build trust and confidence , and to secure greater co-operation from ethnic minority communities			0
i have never thought that those goals can be achieved by having teams of people with titles such as ‘ equality and diversity officer ’			0
our reforms have been dedicated to making the police accountable to the people			0
i believe that , in time , the result will be police forces that are much more representative of the communities they serve , and which treat everyone with decency , respect and justice			2
when that goal is finally achieved , it will be a fitting way to commemorate @entity5			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
