@entity9 and @entity10 have earned an average of 180 rupees - or £ 2 - a year			1
and for the last 11 years the have worked for free following a dispute with their employer			2
record breakers ? @entity9 and @entity10 , both 59 , have applied to the @entity17 for the lowest salary ever paid the two women , both aged 59 , started working as toilet cleaners for the government ’s women teacher ’s @entity21 , in @entity3 , in 1971 , for 15 rupees ( 18p ) a month as fresh - faced 18 - year - olds			1
but they ’ve not had a pay rise ever since , even though they have never missed a day ’s work			2
even though they are angry , they ’ve now applied to the @entity17 for the title of the lowest salary in the world			1
@entity9 said : ‘ we were promised a pay rise every year but it never came			2
we trusted our employers that eventually they ’d pay us			2
we never believed it ’d come to this			0
dedicated : the two women started working as toilet cleaners in @entity3 , in 1971 , for 15 rupees ( 18p ) a month ‘ we take pride in our work ; we could n’t give it up			1
we have always hoped that we would get what we were promised			0

@entity54 , president of the @entity55 , in @entity44 , has been helping the women take their case to the @entity58			1
however , even though the @entity43 ordered the government to pay out , in 2003 , nothing was given to the women			1
and even after the same decision from the @entity63 of @entity64 , in 2004 , and the @entity58 , in 2010 , concluded the government should pay out , they are yet to do so			0
