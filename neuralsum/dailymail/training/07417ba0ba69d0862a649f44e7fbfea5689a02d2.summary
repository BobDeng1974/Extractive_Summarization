by @entity0 this is the heart - stopping moment two @entity4 sailors are washed off the side of a yacht as it is capsizes while being buffeted by 115mph winds			1
@entity9 and @entity10 are seen desperately trying to grab hold of the 70ft boat as they are swept overboard when the freak weather conditions hit			1
their 70ft yacht was blown onto one side as the wind built then smashed almost 180 degrees onto the other as the tornado struck			1
dramatic footage of the ordeal shows the boat ’s crew dragging the pair out of the water and back on board the boat as the winds ease			1
the tornado can then be seen disappearing into the distance as the boat returns to upright			1
ms @entity9 , 34 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , and ms @entity10 , 65 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , were both wearing life jackets at the time and were shaken but uninjured in the ordeal			1
they were part of an 18 - strong crew on the @entity58 yacht competing in the @entity59 , a 40,000 - mile yacht race for amateur sailors			1
the footage , filmed from a camera fixed to the yacht ’s mast , was taken in the @entity23 just north of @entity24 in january as the fleet raced from @entity67 to @entity68			1
it was released by race organisers as the fleet of 12 boats begins the final leg of the race from @entity75 in the @entity76 to the finish in @entity78 today			0
it comes just months after @entity78 sailor @entity80 , 46 , was swept overboard a rival yacht in the middle of the @entity23			1
@entity80 was rescued after spending 90 minutes in the water			1
@entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right were both washed overboard after the 70ft yacht they were aboard was hit by a tornado just north of @entity24 in the @entity23 in january like many of the competitors , ms @entity9 , who manages sports events , had never sailed before signing up to to the race			1
she joined the crew for the legs from @entity93 to @entity94 in @entity95 then from @entity67 to @entity68			0
she said : ' we had been through a lot of squalls in the race and so we had a routine and we knew what we were doing			0
' we could see another squall was coming and so another team mate and i went up to the mast to help reduce our sails			0
' i could n’t reach the mast from where i was so unclipped my safety line to clip it onto the mast and in that split second the waterspout hit			0
' i remember being hit by a rush of water			0
i lost my balance and the force of the water just took me over the side			2
as the winds begin to subside , the boat rights itself allowing the crew to safely rescue the two women she said : ' i was shouting at my crew ‘ i ’m not clipped on , i ’m not clipped on ! ’ my heart was in my mouth - it was pretty frightening			1
' as the waterspout passed the boat started to right itself and i scrabbled around trying to grab hold of anything i could			0
' @entity10 was also in the water next to me			1
our team mates were able to grab us and pull us back onboard			0
' it all happened so quickly and yet it felt like it was going on forever			2
' the tornado passed and we were told to go down into the cabin			2
i was shaken but the support of the crew was amazing			0
' after a while i was able to rejoin my watch on deck and i slowly got back into doing my jobs around the boat			0
' it has n’t put me off sailing but it has given me a new respect for the sea			0
' sir @entity149 , founder and chairman of the race , praised the crew of the yacht for their response to the drama			2
he said : ' what this video shows is how well trained the crews are			0
' they ’re racing along on a 70ft boat and the next thing they know they are hit by a tornado and the boat is knocked onto its side			1
' the forces inside these funnels wind are huge but no - one was hurt , everyone knew exactly what to do			2
' the boat rights itself as soon as the tornado passes and the crew deal with the situation very quickly and professionally			2
' it is incredibly rare to be hit by a tornado but our crews spend months being trained for every possibility			2
' the @entity59 teams are expected to arrive at @entity180 on saturday			0
more than 670 amateur sailors from all over the world have taken part in this year ’s race , the ninth edition of the event , which started in @entity180 in september last year			0
the youngest sailor was 18 and the oldest was 74 .			0
