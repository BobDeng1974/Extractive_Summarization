@entity0 managed @entity1 for six years at @entity2 , including the two most iconic games of @entity1 ’s @entity2 career : the @entity6 win in @entity7 in 2005 and the @entity9 final victory of 2006			1
@entity0 , now at @entity10 where he last month won the @entity11 against @entity12 to add to last season ’s @entity13 , writes exclusively for @entity15 on his memories of his @entity2 captain			1
when i became @entity2 manager my first job was to travel to @entity21 where @entity22 were competing in @entity23 and speak with @entity1 , @entity24 and @entity25 , who were all in the squad			1
i was telling them about my ideas and my tactics and they were incredibly attentive , analysing everything i said			2
and then i remember asking them what they could bring to the team			2
and @entity1 ’s first word was : ‘ passion			1
’ that was his first thought always			2
and for years he has provided that for @entity2 , almost a representative of the @entity41 on the pitch			1
and , of course , it is the first word most people will come up with to describe him now that he has announced that he is leaving @entity2 at the end of the season			1
but important as that was to his game , it should n’t be allowed to overshadow the superb technical qualities , passing abilities and the physicality that he had			2
on his most famous night , the @entity6 final in @entity7 , he started in midfield before moving to be a second striker with @entity70 when @entity71 was injured			0
then @entity73 manager @entity72 put @entity74 on the pitch and @entity1 played almost as a full back or a wing back			1
i know that he has had hundreds of great games for @entity2 and even in my time managing the club there were plenty			1
everyone talks about the @entity84 game in the group stages of the @entity6 and the @entity9 final against @entity61 in 2006			0
but it ’s difficult to look beyond @entity7 when i ’m choosing my favourite			0
even when we were 3 - 0 down at half - time , the message was that if we can score one goal , we were back in the game			0
it was typical that it should be @entity1 who got us that crucial first goal on 54 minutes			1
@entity1 celebrates his ( now famous ) goal against @entity84 at @entity58 in the @entity6 manager @entity0 and club captain @entity1 discuss tactics in training at @entity100 back in 2007 in football , sometimes , there is a moment when something happens to change the dynamic — and that was it			1
maybe if the goal had been scored by another player , it would n’t have had quite such a galvanising effect			0
but you can see from his reaction — cajoling the players and the crowd — that he was an inspiration for everyone and he started the feeling that the team could come back to win			0
after that final we were fortunate as a coaching team that we could work with him for another five years , as he almost left that summer for @entity124			2
eventually the pull of @entity2 proved too much and we had long meetings trying to explain our plans and ambition and how important he was to us			1
after that final in @entity7 he said to us on the coaching staff : ‘ you have to make me the best midfielder in the world			2
’ that showed how ambitious he was — but also how hard he was willing to work			0
and he was as much an inspiration in training as he was in games			0
we were introducing some new ideas , with a more @entity141 style of playing , more passing and maybe less direct football			0
he was always keen to absorb and learn			0
@entity0 ( pictured in 2008 ) said he was lucky to have so long with @entity1 as he almost left to join @entity124 @entity1 and @entity0 in coversation in 2008 before their @entity6 clash with @entity147 i know @entity1 has joked about how difficult it was to get a compliment from me in those years			1
but i think he realises now how highly i regarded him			0
if you have a very clever son or daughter and your other child is not so clever , you would be telling the one who is not so clever : ‘ oh			0
that ’s fantastic ! ’ but the one who is clever , you would be pushing all the time			0
that ’s how they will improve			0
of course , we did encourage him and say : ‘ well done ’ — just not every day			0
in the end , it was @entity1 who made the most out of his ability and we were just the coaching team lucky enough to be in place at that stage of his career			1
it got to the point with @entity1 that even if he was having a rare bad day you would still be thinking : ‘ he ’s not playing well but still i have to keep him on because he can score inside or outside the box or from a free - kick			2
’ whatever he does next , i ’m sure he ’ll be a huge success			0
and now that he is approaching the end of his career at @entity2 , i can safely say a huge : ‘ well done ! ’ and hopefully he knows just how much i appreciated him			1
@entity1 jogs with @entity181 ( left ) and @entity182 ( right ) at the @entity100 training ground @entity1 recently revealed he decided to quit @entity2 after a conversation with @entity185			1

@entity1 will leave @entity2 at the end of the *current* season
@entity0 claims @entity1 was passionate in everything he did
the @entity10 boss said he was the @entity41 's representative on the pitch
@entity0 managed @entity22 midfielder @entity1 for six years at @entity2
