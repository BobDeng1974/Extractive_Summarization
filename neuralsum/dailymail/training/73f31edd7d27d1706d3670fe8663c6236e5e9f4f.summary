twelve years ago , @entity0 was a college drop - out working at his dad 's furniture store when a mugging at a @entity7 , @entity6 karaoke bar changed his life forever			1
back then , the 31 - year - old sported a mullet , drove a red camaro and was the ' life of the party '			0
but after suffering a profound brain injury , @entity0 started to see the world in a whole new light - literally - and became obsessed with math and physics			1
he has since been diagnosed as one of only 40 with acquired savant syndrome , in which once - normal people become skilled in math , art or music after a brain injury			1
then and now : @entity0 was the ' life of the party ' before an attack at a karaoke bar in september 2002 turned him into a math genius ( pictured in 1988 on the left , and more recently on the right ) life in technicolor : after being knocked unconscious at a local bar , @entity0 woke up the next morning to find he noticed life in more detail than before			1
now he draws what he sees and sells his pictures as art @entity0 writes about the life - altering experience in his new memoir out tuesday , ' struck by genius : how a @entity44 '			1
it all started the night of september 13 , 2002 when @entity0 went out to a karaoke bar near his home and was mugged			1
a beautiful mind : @entity0 writes about the life - altering experience of becoming a savant in his memoir ' struck by genius ' , which hits book stores tuesday two men attacked him from behind and punched him in the back of the head , knocking him unconscious			2
at the hospital , he was treated for a bruised kidney but released the same night			0
the next morning , @entity0 woke up and found that his vision had changed to include details he never noticed before			2
he started the tap in his bathroom and noticed ' lines emanating out perpendicularly from the flow			0
' ' at first , i was startled and worried for myself , but it was so beautiful that i just stood in my slippers and stared , ' @entity0 told the @entity69			2
@entity0 stopped going to work and spent all of his time studying math and physics , focusing on fractals , which are repeated geometric patterns			1
even though he showed no talent for art before , he started drawing fractals in extreme detail - sometimes taking weeks to finish the work			0
but there was also a downside to his new talents			0
while he was once outgoing , @entity0 turned introverted and started to spend all of his time at home , covering up his windows with blankets and refusing visitors			2
he became obsessed with germs and would wash his hands until they were red , and would n't even hug his own daughter until she washed her hands as well			0
@entity0 thought he was going crazy , but hope came after watching a @entity93 documentary on @entity94 , an autistic savant			2
' that ’s it ! that ’s what ’s going on with me			0
oh , my @entity100 ! someone else can see what i see ! ' @entity0 remembers thinking			2
after watching the film he decided to reach out to dr @entity104 , the leading expert on savantism , who diagnosed him with ' acquired savant syndrome '			1
back to school : @entity0 re-enrolled in college after the brain injury			1
pictured above with his wife there are currently just 40 people in the world who have been diagnosed with the syndrome , becoming seemingly smarter after a brain injury			1
@entity0 began to understand his situation more when he traveled to @entity117 to be studied by dr @entity118			0
dr @entity118 used @entity121 machines to survey @entity0 's brain and found that the left side was more activated , especially in the left parietal love where ' math lives '			1
it seems that after the injury , neurotransmitters flooded the left side of @entity0 's brain and ultimately changed the structure making him hyper - specialized			1
after his diagnosis , @entity0 decided to apply his new - found mental capacity by enrolling in community college			0
now 43 , @entity0 believes he is an example that everyone has untapped genius potential			0
. ' i believe i am living proof that these powers lie dormant in all of us , ' @entity0 writes in his memoir			0
' if it could happen to me , it could happen to anyone			0

after suffering a brain injury in 2002 , @entity0 became obsessed with math and physics
he has since been diagnosed as one of only 40 people who have ' acquired savant syndrome '
those with the syndrome develop talents for math , art or music after brain injuries
