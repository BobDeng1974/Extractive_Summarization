by @entity0 a garden trough used as a flower planter for 30 years has been identified as rare 2,000 - year - old marble coffin worth over £ 100,000			1
the unsuspecting couple from @entity5 inherited the 6ft 9in long sarcophagus from the previous owners of their house , who left it behind in 1982			1
the retired pair only realised its worth when they learned of a similar ornament on sale at an auction house			1
the owners believed their ' planter ' - that had been used to grow flowers for 30 years - was not valuable , until they spotted a similar ornament on sale at auction and discovered it was worth more than £ 100,000 experts were invited to inspect it and discovered the one - tonne trough was a rare ornate @entity27 sarcophagus - a coffin carved from stone that usually sits above ground - dating back to the @entity30			1
auctioneers said the couple were ' shocked ' when they learned how valuable it is			2
made from @entity34 , the sarcophagus would have been commissioned for the funeral of a wealthy woman and placed in a private mausoleum in @entity38			1
the sarcophagus is worth more than the couple , who asked not to be identified , paid for the home it was found in			1
the previous owners did not even mention the sarcophagus on the house deeds and clearly did not know its value			1
it is almost identical to another roman sarcophagus that is in the @entity50 in the @entity51			2
the 2,000 - year - old sarcophagushas is made from marble and has been verified by auctioneers and a respected archeologist the carved marble side features cherubs that represent charm , beauty and creativity in @entity62 mythology the sarcophagus , which is expected to fetch a six - figure sum at auction , would have been commissioned for the funeral of a wealthy @entity67 the front is carved with a central panel of the three graces , which represent charm , beauty , and creativity in @entity62 mythology			1
it is not known how it found its way to the rural house near @entity76 , but a copper plaque on the back of the sarcophagus states ' bought from @entity38 in 1902			1
' @entity81 , of @entity83 auction house in @entity84 , @entity85 , flew to @entity86 as soon as he saw the pictures of the sarcophagus the couple had emailed			1
he found the rare ornament filled with plants and soil and left on the grass			2
he said : ' it is quite exceptional for a something of this importance to turn up unrecognised in a garden			0
' they told me that they acquired it when they bought the house and just thought it was an ornamental plant trough			1
each end of the ornament features a griffin but the back is bare as it was intended to stand against a wall ' the people who sold the house did n't make a big fuss about it and it was n't mentioned in the deeds so they could n't have know what it was			2
' the property is very close to @entity76 and the sarcophagus dates back to @entity118 but that is purely a coincidence			2
' it has always been in the same spot and the vendors have found it ideal for putting bedding plants in over the last 30 years			1
' i think they were a little shocked when i confirmed what it was and how much it might sell for			0
' after i left they took great care in emptying the soil out of it and a crane was brought in to place it on a lorry and drive down to us			0
' mr @entity81 said although it is impossible to know for sure how the ornament made its way to @entity141 , a possible theory is that it was one of seven sarcophagi bought by @entity146 railroad magnate @entity145 from the @entity148 gallery in @entity38 for $ 1million			2
mystery surrounds how the sarcophagus made its way to @entity141 but a copper plaque on the back reads : ' brought from @entity38 in 1902 ' mr @entity81 said : ' it is interesting to speculate whether the sarcophagus we are selling could relate to @entity145 ' purchase			0
' @entity158 , an archaeologist and art expert , who examined the sarcophagus , said : ' it was obviously intended for a high status individual			0
' the combination of the strigilated panels and the figural decoration indicates that it was intended for a wealthy individual			0
' the simply hewn back probably suggests that it came from a private mausoleum , where the tomb was placed against a wall			0
' the sarcophagus will be sold at auction in @entity84 on february 14			0
details from an @entity27 sarcophagus the @entity27 placed a lot of importance on funeral ceremonies as they believed without being properly laid to rest , the soul 's of the deceased continued to roam			1
wealthy @entity27 were given elaborate and ritualised funerals where homage was paid to their ancestors			1
relatives would try to catch the last breath of the dying with their mouth - as that is where they believed the soul escaped the body from			0
the corpse was bathed and perfumed and coins would be placed under the tongue or over the eyes of the dead to ensure safe passage to the underworld			0
funerals were held by torch light and at the front of the procession was a picture of the deceased			0
cremation was most common and the ashes of the dead were kept in the family mausoleum but burial became increasingly popular			0
@entity208 became more common in the @entity209 and were carved with scenes from mythology , religious beliefs of hunting			0
a funeral pile was constructed in the shape of an alter and the nearest relative of the dead was tasked with setting it on fire			0
poor @entity27 would bury the corpses if they could afford to or throw the body in a creek or river .			2

the @entity5 couple inherited ' planter ' when they bought house
used it for flowers for 30 years before seeing similar trough on sale
experts identified it as a rare ornate @entity27 sarcophagus
it would have been commissioned for the funeral of a wealthy @entity67
is expected to fetch a six figure sum when it goes on sale next month
