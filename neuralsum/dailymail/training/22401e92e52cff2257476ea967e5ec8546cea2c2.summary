@entity1 is a poison and its sale should be as tightly regulated as cigarettes and alcohol , scientists say			1
they warn that sugary foods and drinks are responsible for illnesses including obesity , heart disease , cancer and liver problems			1
and they claim it contributes to 35million deaths a year worldwide and is so dangerous it should be controlled through taxation and legislation			1
@entity1 is ' toxic ' beyond its calories , warn scientists			1
they suggest a sales tax licensing requirements on vending machines in an article entitled @entity25 , published in the journal nature , the scientists add : ‘ a little is not a problem but a lot kills – slowly			1
’ the @entity30 authors warn obesity is now a bigger problem than malnourishment across the world , and that sugar not only makes people fat but also changes the body ’s metabolism , raises blood pressure , throws hormones off balance and harms the liver			1
the damage done mirrors the effects of drinking too much alcohol – which the scientists point out is made from distilling sugar			1
the authors , led by @entity48 , a childhood obesity expert at @entity50 , say that , like alcohol , sugar is widely available , toxic , easily abused and harmful to society			2
they say teaching children about diet and exercise is unlikely to be effective and instead the answer lies in taxes and restricting availability			2
the study recommends using taxation to double the price of fizzy drinks , restricting their sale to those over 17 or 18 , and tightening regulations covering school vending machines and snack bars			2
dr @entity69 , also of @entity50 , said : ‘ we ’re not talking about prohibition			2
we ’re not advocating a major imposition of the government into people ’s lives			2
‘ what we want is actually to increase people ’s choices by making foods that are n’t loaded with sugar comparatively easier and cheaper to get			0
’ the article also reveals that consumption of sugar has tripled in the past 50 years and that there are now more obese people than malnourished ones across the world			0
it concludes that responsibility lies with the food companies , saying that while they may resist change , shifts in policy are possible if the pressure is great enough			0
examples include the ban on smoking in public places and the fitting of airbags in cars			0
the article ends : ‘ these simple measures are taken for granted as tools for our public health and well - being			1
it ’s time to turn our attention to sugar			0
’ however , other scientists have described the essay as ‘ puritanical ’ , saying sugar is only toxic when eaten in unrealistic amounts			0
@entity112 , of the @entity113 , which represents the @entity115 food and drink industry , said that while urgent action was needed to beat heart and other diseases , it was wrong to focus on sugar alone			0
she added : ‘ the causes of these diseases are multi-factorial and demonising food components does not help consumers to build a realistic approach to their diet			0
‘ the key to good health is a balanced and varied diet in a lifestyle that includes plenty of physical activity			0
