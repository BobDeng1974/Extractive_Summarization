title favourites @entity0 drew 1 - 1 with 10 - man @entity1 after @entity3 came off the bench to salvage a point for the hosts against his former employers			1
here , @entity10 's @entity9 gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players @entity1 @entity16 6.5 - not called seriously into action before the goal , largely thanks to the defending in front of him			1
@entity21 7 - got through some good work down the right hand side and teamed up well with @entity24			1
rash tackle for second booking			0
@entity26 8 - a super example of leadership and intelligent defending from @entity1 ’s captain			1
won his duel with @entity31			0
@entity1 captain won his highly - anticipated duel with @entity31 at the @entity34 on sunday @entity36 7.5 - a debut for the new signing and an impressive one , too			1
looked like he had partnered @entity26 for years			1
@entity40 7 - not always the cutest defender but does n’t make mistakes either			0
fernandinho 7.5 - @entity1 ’s most important holding player , the @entity44 was terrific again here			1
@entity45 7.5 - much improved after the horrors of @entity47 but could n’t get forward effectively once @entity1 had ten @entity3 scores against his former club but declines to celebrate his vital strike in the 1 - 1 draw @entity24 7 - an under - rated player by many people but came in and did a good job here			1
delicate touch to set up equaliser			0
@entity58 7 - @entity57 in an increased amount of game town and looked more dangerous than @entity61			0
@entity62 6.5 - could n’t quite see enough of the ball to regularly hurt @entity0 but involved in equaliser			2
@entity61 6.5 - still does n’t look himself after a run of injuries			0
will get sharper with games			0
@entity68 : @entity69 6 , @entity70 6 , @entity3 7 @entity61 appeared off the pace during the match against @entity0 following a run of injuries @entity0 @entity75 worked overly hard but good low save from @entity61 early in the second half			1
@entity80 7 - a reliable influence on this @entity0 team , the big full - back rarely lets his team down			2
@entity83 7 - looks a better player than he is because of the influence of @entity86			2
it ’s a partnership that works , though			0
@entity86 , pictured here confronting @entity62 , proved he is still one of @entity89 's best defenders on his day @entity86 8 - on days like his he still looks like one of the best defenders in the country			2
big games bring the best from him			0
@entity95 7 - still finding his way in this team but did a reasonable job on stifling the threat of @entity24 and @entity21 down his side @entity101 fabregas 6.5 - he is important to @entity0 ’s rhythm and rarely wasted the ball			1
lacked a decisive influence though			0
@entity101 celebrates @entity0 's opener against @entity1 scored by @entity106 ( right ) @entity108 6.5 - similarly , @entity108 ’s importance to @entity0 is growing and he is dangerous when breaking			1
@entity109 6.5 - could n’t see enough of the ball in the time he had on the field			0
@entity114 6 - worked hard as always , especially in the first half when @entity1 had more of the ball			2
@entity118 hazard 7.5 - coveted by @entity1 at one point , the @entity117 has a devastating turn of pace over five years and worried the home team constantly with his direct running			2
@entity125 provided the valuable assist for @entity106 during another impressive performance for the @entity127 @entity31 7 - suffered at the hands of the brilliant @entity26 but managed to free himself long enough to feel @entity125 in the run - up to the goal			1
@entity68 : @entity131 6 , @entity106 7 , @entity132 , 6 referee : @entity134 5.5 - too many cards in the first half meant that a red card was always a distinct possibility .			0

@entity3 came off the bench to score against his former club
the @entity1 *midfielder* refused to celebrate his vital goal
@entity106 gave @entity0 the lead after @entity21 was sent off
@entity86 and @entity26 were among the star performers
