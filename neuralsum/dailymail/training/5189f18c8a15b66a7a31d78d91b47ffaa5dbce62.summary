@entity1 packed his schedule with events and receptions attended by party stalwarts throughout the long weekend of inauguration festivities , stoking speculation he may be laying the groundwork to carry the torch from president @entity15			1
it comes after @entity1 played a prominent role in brokering a compromise on the fiscal cliff standoff with @entity20 and his work developing gun violence legislation following december 's deadly school shooting in @entity24			1
@entity40 , the former @entity41 senator and first lady , remains the heavy favorite among party activists but several notable @entity35 , including @entity1 , @entity41 gov. @entity45 and @entity47 gov. @entity46 , are said to be keeping their options open in case @entity40 decides not to run again			1
as vice president , @entity1 can stay in the spotlight and is no stranger to the demands of a presidential campaign after failed bids in 1988 and 2008			1
the former @entity57 senator has racked up a long list of domestic and foreign policy achievements even as his occasional off - script moments have become fodder for @entity62			0
the one - day president and first lady ? : @entity1 and his wife @entity65 wave to the crowd as they walk down @entity29 yesterday ' there 's a whole lot of reasons why i would n't run , ' @entity1 , who will be nearly 74 on @entity68 in 2016 , told @entity73 in an interview before the inauguration			1
' i do n't have to make that decision for a while			0
in the meantime , there 's one thing i know i have to do , no matter what i do			0
i have to help this president move this country to the next stage			0
' yet with his high - profile perch , @entity1 is doing nothing to tamp down the speculation			1
@entity1 's private swearing - in ceremony on sunday was attended by recently - elected @entity90 gov. @entity89 , someone who would be a potent ally in the state 's first - in - the - nation primary			1
attendees at a sunday afternoon reception at the vice president 's residence at the @entity97 said they noticed a lot of party activists from early voting states like @entity90 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
vice president @entity1 and his wife @entity65 wave to the crowd as they walk down @entity29 en route to the @entity31 @entity104 is now openly speculating that vice president @entity1 might plan a run for the @entity31 in 2016 ' we can always start the political calculations in terms of the number of delegates needed to secure a nomination			1
but let 's just say i see a number of superdelegates here as well , ' @entity35 strategist @entity112 told reporters following the ceremony			0
@entity1 later dropped by the @entity119 , slipping up and telling partygoers he was ' proud to be president of the @entity122 , ' prompting cheers			1
he quickly corrected himself , saying he was ' proud to be vice president of the @entity122 , but i am prouder to be ... president @entity15 's vice president			1
' laughing it off , he said , ' there 's goes that			0
' during the weekend , @entity1 attended a ball at the @entity130 celebrating the party 's @entity132 voters , who turned into a powerful voting bloc in november 's election			1
@entity1 called the @entity132 community ' a decisive factor ' in the election			2
' this is your moment , ' @entity1 said			2
' some party stalwarts said it was noteworthy that @entity1 asked @entity144 @entity143 , the first @entity146 justice , to administer the oath of office			2
in four years time will @entity1 and @entity148 be dancing to his victory as the 45th @entity150 ? powerful : as one of the chief negotiators of the fiscal cliff compromise and one of the key authors of the upcoming gun control legislation of the @entity15 administration , @entity1 is a very influential vice president @entity1 also attended a ball honoring environmentalists , sponsored by the @entity160 and other environmental groups , where he said the @entity15 administration was committed to confronting climate change			1
' i do n't intend to let these four years go by without getting a hell of a lot done , ' on the environment , @entity1 said			2
on @entity169 , @entity1 and his wife , @entity168 , walked part of the parade route , waving to the cheering crowds in a made - for - tv moment			2
at one point , the vice president even jogged across @entity29 to shake hands with ' today ' show weatherman @entity177			0
' it seems obvious that he 's going to keep that option open for himself and do the right things , ' said @entity182 , the @entity35 leader of the @entity101 state senate who attended the reception			0
@entity182 said @entity1 actively worked the room , thanking supporters for their help during the 2012 campaign			2

despite the fact he would almost be 74 if he achieved victory - @entity1 remains the picture of health on tuesday afternoon , @entity1 met with members of the @entity196 at a private reception after a @entity196 meeting , where delegates unanimously re-elected @entity201 rep. @entity200 to another term as chairman			2
a frequently played campaign theme song , @entity205 's ' @entity204 , ' could be heard from outside the room and attendees said @entity1 thanked them for their work during the campaign and offered an upbeat assessment of the second term			1
if @entity40 decides not to run , @entity1 could draw upon good will from party activists , an ability to connect with regular folks and extensive campaigning in key states like @entity101 , @entity90 , @entity201 and @entity218			2
but he would also need to deal with personal poll numbers that rank below @entity15 's and a propensity to commit foot - in - mouth moments in an era where political gaffes can quickly sink a campaign			0
@entity90 state sen. @entity225 , who was among the attendees at @entity1 's sunday reception , said it was ' early to read into ' @entity1 's interest in 2016			0
but said there was ' huge support ' in the key primary state			0
