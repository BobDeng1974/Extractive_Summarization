@entity1 ’s @entity0 are furious about a new television documentary they claim has depicted them as brutal thugs			1
the club ’s former owner @entity6 has complained to @entity8 and demanded they make alterations to their programme @entity11 , which is due to air on @entity12 and charts their remarkable rise from non-league football to winning the @entity15 at @entity16 in 11 years			1
in it , @entity17 describes a horrific attack by @entity20 on a team - mate at the club ’s training ground , while @entity20 himself is on camera appearing to glory in intimidation and violence around the club , saying at one stage : ‘ we ruled by fear			1
’ @entity1 ’s ex-owner @entity6 ( centre ) has complained to @entity8 and demanded they alter it @entity8 's documentary @entity11 is due to air on @entity12 and charts their remarkable rise @entity6 attended the film ’s premiere in @entity40 on thursday night with former managers @entity41 and @entity43 and ex-players @entity44 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 — all of whom were interviewed for the programme — and was outraged at what he sees as a lack of balance			1
‘ @entity1 was a group of people who worked hard and fought against heavy odds for 20 years and came up trumps , ’ said @entity6 , who flew from @entity56 to attend the screening			1
‘ we represented the little person , the working - class fan who does n’t have a lot but works hard and does n’t give up			1
‘ everyone at the club i have spoken to was appalled at the way the programme made us look			1
’ @entity6 and @entity41 were seething that @entity20 was given more airtime than anyone else and gave the impression the team ’s core ethics were threats and bullying			1
@entity75 said : ‘ the programme portrayed the group as violent thugs as if that was all they had to them			1
the suggestion was that the players were just a bunch of @entity83 ’s boys and they were all terrified of him			1
it was far , far from the truth			1
@entity17 ( left ) describes a horrific attack by @entity20 on a team - mate at the club ’s training ground @entity17 was among those seen as the hard men of @entity1 's squad that rose to the top of football ‘ it was n’t the @entity99 show			1
we had some very good players			2
@entity96 , @entity48 and @entity46 played for @entity102 , @entity95 went on to manage @entity103			2
’ @entity41 felt his time as manager between 1981 and 1987 when they shot up the leagues to reach the @entity108 was undervalued and the sense of fun and camaraderie had not been properly represented			2
in the no - holds barred documentary , @entity17 , who now plays tough guys as an actor in @entity116 , admitted he had been shocked by the savagery of one @entity120 attack on an unnamed @entity1 player			1
‘ @entity83 literally lifted him up , swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated			2
the fella had to have 20 stitches or 30 stitches in his calf , split it to bits , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity83 could be hilarious , a very funny man			2
but when he was angry , he was a very tough man			2
’ the programme also highlights a feud between @entity20 and @entity95 that ended with the latter calling a reporter and telling him @entity20 had tried to karate - kick his legs			1
defender @entity46 was a witness			2
he told the programme : ‘ we were used to seeing very unusual things but that face - to - face , coming to blows was the most shocking thing i saw			1
’ striker @entity44 said : ‘ for six years they never spoke to each other			2
they were in the same changing room but would n’t even celebrate together			2
’ @entity20 talks about the intimidation and violence around the club , saying : ‘ we ruled by fear			2
wonderful ’ @entity1 's @entity20 and @entity46 talk to referee @entity147 during a win over @entity149 in 1993 the documentary has caused upset with former owner @entity6 , who says : ‘ it was n’t the @entity99 show ' @entity95 said : ‘ from the first moment , he knew what i was and i knew what he was			1
’ @entity48 thought @entity95 , who holds a university degree , regarded the more streetwise @entity157 as pretentious			2
@entity20 comes across as unapologetic in the film but does admit : ‘ sometimes i wince at some things we made them do			2
locking them in the boot of their car , dragging them around the pitch			0
‘ i grabbed @entity46 by his nostrils			0
he had one of two choices , you either sink or swim			0
there were days when you thought @entity174 was almost breaking			0
but if he and @entity175 ( @entity47 ) saw us today , they would say , “ thank you @entity83 ” , you may have beaten the hell out of us but you changed our character			0
’ while some of the @entity0 loved the atmosphere instigated by @entity41 and assistant @entity180 , some of the later signings found it hard to cope			1
@entity46 , signed from @entity182 , admits : ‘ the first thing i ’d think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it , having a drink			0
was it conducive to me playing well ? obviously not as an athlete			0
but at that stage it was a coping mechanism			0
‘ i remember getting in the car and getting psyched up for training so i would be able to cope for it			0
the @entity0 would swallow me up			1
’ while some of the @entity0 loved the atmosphere , others like @entity46 ( left ) found it hard to cope @entity46 : ‘ the first thing i ’d think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it , having a drink ' @entity200 's @entity199 is tackled by @entity1 's @entity46 in 1993 @entity47 recalls seeing some players cry at the abuse they received			1
he said : ‘ it was like a pack of wolves going out looking for blood			0
i ’ve seen players cry , physically break down			0
it was a place for me that was really dark for six months , socially and emotionally			0
‘ as a footballer you have dreams ; for six months i had no dreams			0
i used to sit in my bedroom upstairs , and i ’d say , “ my career is gone , where can i go from here ? ” ’ @entity180 is unrepentant at creating a culture where only the strongest survived			0
‘ very tough love , ’ he calls it			0
@entity46 and @entity47 did survive and shared in the @entity15 glory			1
but some of the most savage treatment was saved for opponents , with centre half @entity49 admitting : ‘ we went too far loads of times			0
’ striker @entity228 recalls putting @entity230 ’s nose out of place in the opening minutes and then catching him on the other side			0
@entity17 summed up the deliberate intimidation			0
‘ there were a few punch - ups , there were a few confrontations			1
we ’d look for an opponent who was weak and play on it			0
i ’d say , “ @entity241 , we ’ve got one here ”			0
@entity17 went on to become an actor and the @entity244 player now plays tough guys in @entity116 ‘ we ’d shout , “ put it in the mixer ” , when the ball was in the air , you ’d see their legs going , they ’d be thinking “ oh , s * * * ”			0
we were a proper organised force			0
’ for many @entity1 players , it was a final chance to beat the odds			1
@entity261 ’s child @entity120 , hod carrier @entity17 and @entity149 reject @entity96 all went on to great careers after leaving @entity1 , their characters moulded by learning at a tough school			1
there was black humour , too , with @entity41 suggesting setting @entity228 ’s car on fire after he had blocked him getting a pay rise			1
‘ he said , “ what am i going to do ? ”			0
i said , “ go and burn your car and claim on the insurance ” , ’ said @entity41			0
and the fire did take place			0
it was the violence , though , that will divide opinion as to whether @entity1 ’s story was a fairytale or a nightmare			1
the last word went to @entity20 who was asked if he had any regrets			0
‘ not striking @entity95 sooner , ’ he replied			0
@entity41 , then - manager of @entity1 , pictured with the team players during his time in charge @entity8 is to premiere the next instalment in its @entity289 series , the @entity0 , on december 26 on @entity8 at 9pm .			1
