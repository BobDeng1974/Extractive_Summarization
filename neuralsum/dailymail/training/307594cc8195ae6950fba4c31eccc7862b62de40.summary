by @entity1 reporter published : 03:36 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 17:06 est , 4 april 2013 @entity3 governor @entity2 signed into law thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre			1
alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at @entity18 , @entity13 signed the bill hours after the @entity20 approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country			1
' this is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room , ' the governor said			1
' we have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do			2
he said later that he did n't think it was right for the families to wait for the victims to be formally identified			2
now , @entity3 joins states including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 in having the country 's strongest gun control laws , said @entity79 , director of mobilization for the @entity81 in @entity82			1
' this would put @entity3 right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws , ' @entity79 said			1
the legislation adds more than 100 firearms to the state 's assault weapons ban and creates what officials have called the nation 's first dangerous weapon offender registry as well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition			1
some parts of the bill would take effect immediately after @entity13 's signature , including background checks for all firearms sales			2
support : now @entity3 is one of the states with the most strict gun control laws in the country advocate : @entity111 governor @entity2 has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control heartfelt : @entity13 was the one to inform the waiting parents on december 14th that their children had been killed following a total of more than 13 hours of respectful and at times somber debate , the @entity118 and the @entity119 voted in favor of the 139 - page bill crafted by leaders from both major parties in the @entity111 - controlled @entity20			1
' i pray today 's bill — the most far - reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 @entity18 families have felt , ' said @entity118 majority leader @entity134			1
' do n't tread on me ' : gun control opponents outside the statehouse in @entity137 , @entity3 , as lawmakers debated the new laws passed last night which ban more than 100 guns and large - capacity ammo magazines gun control advocates : @entity144 , a supporter of gun regulation and her son @entity146 display a sign that reads ' @entity148 's ' inside the statehouse in @entity137 yesterday @entity149 and @entity74 also passed new gun control requirements in the wake of the @entity153 shooting , in which a 20 - year - old gunman used a military - style semi-automatic rifle			1
compared with @entity3 's legislation , which , for example , bans the sale or purchase of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds , @entity74 restricted magazines to seven bullets and gave owners of higher - capacity magazines a year to sell them elsewhere			2
@entity149 banned ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds			2
president @entity167 has urged lawmakers at the national level to take similar action			1
@entity3 @entity118 majority leader @entity134 said of last night 's decision : ' i pray today 's bill - the most far - reaching gun safety legislation in the country - will prevent other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 @entity18 families have felt			1
' some of the measures take effect right away , including an expansion of the state 's assault weapons ban , background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds			1
defining issue : president @entity167 speaks about gun control at the @entity193 in @entity149 yesterday			1
he is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups the massacre reignited a national debate on gun control , and president @entity167 has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term , which started a month after the shooting			1
his proposed gun control measures have largely stalled in @entity205 , however , and @entity167 has planned a trip to @entity3 on monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in @entity82			1
legislative leaders , aware of the attention on them , struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model			1
long debate : @entity214 , a @entity215 senator serving towns in western @entity3 , left , questions @entity119 president @entity218 , @entity219 , during a discussion of a gun bill on the @entity119 floor last night tense : senate minority leader @entity223 , @entity224 , left , and senator @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 , watch a vote for an amendment of the gun - control bill at the @entity231 in @entity137 president @entity167 has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term , which began just a month after the bloody @entity18 massacre			1
@entity3 is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on december 14 , joining @entity74 , @entity76 , @entity73 and @entity149			1
but @entity167 's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in @entity205 , however , and the president has planned a trip to @entity3 on monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in @entity82 he visited @entity149 yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in @entity205 than an assault weapons ban or limits on large - capacity ammunition magazines			1
@entity167 's visit was heavy with political symbolism because @entity149 recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western , largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right			1
@entity149 suffered two of the worst mass shootings in @entity262 history - at @entity264 school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year			2
it has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines			2
@entity167 said @entity149 's action shows ' there does n't have to be a conflict ' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the @entity262 @entity276			1
but the powerful @entity278 gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls			0
several county sheriffs in @entity149 have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions			0
@entity119 president @entity285 , a @entity286 , said : ' the tragedy in @entity153 demands a powerful response , demands a response that transcends politics			2
' it is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country			0
' the bill passed 26 - 10 in the @entity119 and 105 - 44 in the @entity118			0
the legislation adds more than 100 firearms to the state 's assault weapons ban and creates what officials have called the nation 's first dangerous weapon offender registry as well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition			2
but some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues			0
representative @entity309 , a freshman @entity215 lawmaker from @entity153 , acknowledged the legislation ' is not perfect ' and he hoped would be ' a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs			0
' representative @entity312 , @entity137 , said he felt the bill ' does n't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities			0
' he said families in his district who 've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the @entity153 families			1
but @entity119 minority leader @entity223 , @entity224 , whose district includes @entity153 , said he felt he was representing the interests of the @entity18 victims as he cast his vote			0
' i stand here as their voice , as their elected representative , ' he said , reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school			0
lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre			0
' when a child is sent to school , their parents expect them to be safe			0
the @entity18 shooting rampage was a parent 's , a school system 's , a community 's and the nation 's worst nightmare , ' said @entity215 state sen. @entity350 of @entity351			2
horror : @entity352 lead a line of children from the @entity18 in @entity153 , @entity3 on friday , december 14 , 2012 after the massacre at the school which claimed 26 lives grief : young children wait outside @entity18 after the shootings tears : a woman waits to hear about her sister , a teacher , following a shooting at the @entity18 gun rights advocates , who greatly outnumbered gun control supporters in demonstrations held earlier in the day at the @entity231 , railed against the proposals as misguided and unconstitutional			0
@entity153 school gunman @entity370 : he slaughtered 20 first - grade pupils and six teachers with shots from a legally bought high - powered rifle ' no ! no ! no ! ' and ' read the bill ! ' they chanted			0
' we want them to write laws that are sensible , ' said @entity380 , of @entity381 , who was angry he 'll be made a felon if he does n't register his weapons that will no longer be sold in @entity3			2
' what they 're proposing will not stop anything			0
' by the time the @entity119 voted around 6.30pm , many of the gun rights advocates had gone home , leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the @entity119 was read			0
the halls were mostly empty by the time the @entity118 voted at 2.26am this morning			0
among the gun control advocates were @entity396 and @entity144 , of @entity397 , wearing green shirts in honor of the @entity18 victims			0
the @entity401 traveled to @entity137 with their 10 - month - old son , @entity146 , to watch the bill 's passage			0
they said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal			0
' it 's just the beginning of this bill			0
in six months from now , it 's going to get stronger and stronger , ' @entity410 said			0
' i think they 're watching us all over the country			0

@entity417 passes both houses in state legislature with bipartisan support
