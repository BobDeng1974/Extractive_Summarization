by @entity0 at a time when mankind 's encroachment on habitats is increasingly leading species to extinction , scientists have discovered a mass migration of animals in @entity10 that reaches farther than any other documented on the continent			1
the journey made by about 2,000 zebra who travelled between @entity17 and @entity18 , two countries in a sparsely populated part of southern @entity10 , was discovered by wildlife experts only after some of the zebras were collared with tracking devices			1
the newfound migration is a rare bright spot at a time when mass movements of wildlife are disappearing because of fencing , land occupation and other human pressures			1
species of plants and animals around the planet are being wiped out at least 1,000 times faster than they did before humans arrived on the scene , said a separate study published thursday by the journal @entity39			0
scientists have discovered a mass migration of zebras in @entity10 that reaches farther than any other documented on the continent the previously unheralded trek occurs within the @entity45 , which is the size of @entity47 and encompasses national parks in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
' it goes to show us that nature still has some surprises , ' said @entity56 , senior conservation scientist at the @entity58 - based @entity57 that led the two - year study on the migration			2
he said the main reason that the migration was not detected earlier was because it was impossible to know where the animals were going without gps tracking technology , which has become more available and affordable in the last two decades			0
the journey made by about 2,000 zebra who travelled between @entity17 and @entity18 was discovered by wildlife experts after some of the zebras were collared with tracking devices the zebra odyssey encompasses a roundtrip journey of 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) , starting in floodplains near the @entity17 - @entity18 border at the beginning of the wet season			1
it follows a route across the @entity80 and ends at the seasonally full waterholes and nutritional grass of @entity83 in @entity18			2
the zebras spend about 10 weeks there before heading back			0
local residents and conservationists knew the zebras left the @entity80 floodplains and returned months later in the dry season , but they did n't know where the animals went			0
it was n't until researchers put satellite tracking collars on eight zebras and monitored their movements in late 2012 and 2013 that the migration was discovered			2
the findings were published this week in the conservation journal @entity101			0
' this is the longest known land migration in @entity10 , in terms of distance between endpoints , ' @entity56 said			1
the zebra odyssey encompasses a roundtrip journey of 500 kilometers ( 300 miles ) , starting in floodplains near the @entity17 - @entity18 border at the beginning of the wet season to get the data in a military - style operation , ' researchers fired tranquilizer darts at the zebras from a helicopter , landed and affixed gps collars , @entity56 said in an interview from @entity120 , @entity121 , where he is an adjunct professor specializing in the environment at the @entity123			1
@entity124 , a conservation expert at @entity125 , described the migration as an extraordinary discovery at a time when such mass movements are dwindling			1
' even though people have been fascinated by animal migration since the dawn of history , we are just scratching the surface in terms of understanding which animals migrate , where they go , and how they do it , ' @entity124 , who was not involved in the research , wrote in an email			0
wildebeest in the @entity144 migration in @entity10 meander , possibly covering more ground and certainly migrating in greater numbers than the zebra in @entity17 and @entity18			1
but the southern @entity150 zebra move largely in a straight line and the distance between departure and destination points appears to be an average of 10 to 20 kilometers ( 6 to 12 miles ) further than in the @entity144 , according to research cited by @entity56			2
the migration follows a route across the @entity80 and ends at the seasonally full waterholes and nutritional grass of @entity83 in @entity18 @entity161 in @entity162 and @entity163 , @entity165 antelope and @entity167 gazelles are other animals that travel long migration routes			2
other seasonal migrations of note include @entity162 's @entity173 butterflies , songbirds in the @entity175 and humpback whales in the @entity177			0
@entity178 , @entity56 's fellow academic at the @entity123 and an expert on the @entity144 migration , said the zebra research shows that the animals have to move through ' human - dominated lands ' and that the migration could be lost if more protective measures are not put in place			2
@entity178 wrote in an email that people whose land is traversed by the long migration route may obtain incentives to protect it ' with some innovative thinking , ' for example by hooking into tourism			0
in 2004 , a fence that had blocked a zebra migration route since the late 1960s was removed in another part of @entity18			1
some 15,000 zebras traveled the re-opened route in 2008 - 2009 , according to research			0
@entity124 , a conservation expert at @entity125 , described the migration as an extraordinary discovery at a time when such mass movements are dwindling much remains to be learned about the @entity17 - @entity18 migration			1
the @entity57 said long - term research is needed to confirm if the migration is annual and fixed and ' whether this is genetically coded or passed behaviorally from mothers to offspring			0
' the zebras could have reached similar habitats closer to their starting point but instead chose the longer trek , raising the possibility that they are following a pattern that is so ancient it has become embedded in their genes , according to the @entity101 article			0
@entity222 , who leads elephants without @entity224 , a @entity18 - based group that participated in the zebra migration study , said the trek stirs the heart			1
' we all yearn for that , the romance of wild , open spaces , ' @entity222 said			0
' there are very few places left on our planet where animals and wildlife have the natural ability to roam in the context in which they evolved over thousands of years			0

the journey was made by about 2,000 zebra who travelled between @entity17 and @entity18
it encompasses a round trip journey of 500 kilometers ( 300 miles )
@entity249 migration reaches farther than any other documented in @entity10
the newfound migration is a rare bright spot at a time when mass movements of wildlife are disappearing
