@entity2 's state pension bill is set to quadruple by the mid- 2060s , official figures show			1
the ballooning cost of paying the basic state pension will soon be larger than the entire economic output of countries such as @entity7 , @entity8 or the @entity9			1
predictions by the @entity11 say the bill will double from £ 98billion this year to £ 179billion in 20 years – and quadruple to £ 420billion by 2063 - 64			1
expensive grey days : @entity2 's state pension bill is set to quadruple to £ 420billion by 2063 - 64 the cost will equate to 7.7 per cent of @entity2 ’s gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 50 years , compared with 5.8 per cent today			1
experts said the escalating bill was a ‘ ticking time - bomb ’ and presented the government with ‘ serious questions ’ over how taxpayers would fund it			2
they claimed that successive governments had failed to plan for @entity2 ’s ageing population , and that simply pushing back the state pension age would not be enough			1
the number of people receiving the state pension will increase from almost 13million today to nearly 17million in 2034 as @entity2 ’s baby boomers reach retirement			1
rising life expectancy also means the average time spent in retirement is now 26 years for a woman and 22 years for a man			2
baby boomers : the number of people receiving the state pension will be nearly 17million in 2034 the financial implications of this , combined with the cost of a more generous state pension , has seen the total bill sky - rocket			1
the ‘ triple lock ’ on state pensions – introduced two years ago – will cost an additional £ 45bn alone in the next 15 years , according to estimates			1
the lock guarantees price rises in line with earnings , inflation or 2.5 per cent – whichever is the highest – to protect pensioners from paltry increases			0
@entity54 , chief executive of the @entity55 ’ @entity53 , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s pensions bill represents a ticking time - bomb , and the only way politicians can defuse it is by making some tough decisions regarding the retirement age , whether the ‘ triple - lock ’ is sustainable , and how much they can save in other areas			1
‘ these pension debts are hidden away off the government ’s balance sheet , but the consequences will be all too obvious for the next generation unless something is done			2
’ @entity71 , head of pensions research at @entity73 , said : ‘ where is the money going to come from ? health ? defence ? policing ? it will present some potentially tough choices			2
‘ the fact that as a nation we are living longer means we will need a retirement income for longer – and this is one of the factors behind the projected growth in the future cost of the @entity87			2
’ official statistics show one in three babies born last year will live to celebrate their 100th birthday , as @entity92 ’s life expectancy continues to rapidly improve with advances in healthcare			0
the average life expectancy in the @entity2 is currently 79 years for men and 83 for women			1
@entity98 , the government ’s business champion for older workers , said further rises in the state pension age would not be enough to solve @entity2 ’s dilemma over how to fund such an enormous bill			1
she said : ‘ none of this should come as a surprise to politicians because the demographics have been in place for decades			0
depressing statistics : the cost of state pension will equate to 7.7 per cent of @entity2 ’s gross domestic product ( gdp ) in 50 years , compared with 5.8 per cent today ‘ we should have been prepared for it and yet the state pension remains completely un-funded			1
it is case of ‘ pay - as – you - go – or pray - as - you - go , more like			0
‘ for decades , we have made all these promises and just hoped that the next generation can afford to pay for it			0
‘ part of the solution must be that people to work for longer , which raises more in tax revenue and make it more affordable			0
but employers need to offer more flexible , part - time work if this is going to happen			0
’ this week , the government announced a new target for the average retirement age to rise by six months every year			0
this is not a policy , but merely a change the government is hoping will occur			0
even the @entity11 itself seemed unsure this could be achieved , however , saying it would ‘ not normally expect ’ such a ‘ meaningful ’ change in such a short time			1
the government hopes that if people choose to work for longer , it will not only boost their pension pots but help to fund healthcare and care home costs for an increasingly elderly population , through increased tax revenue			2
admitting it was an ‘ ambitious ’ target , @entity149 , the @entity149 pensions minister , said : ‘ what we are doing is catching up with decades of longer living			2
‘ we are living longer but the labour market and people ’s retirement age has not been keeping up			0
’ the government wants the average retirement age to keep up with state pension age , which will increase to 66 by 2020 for both men and women			1
it will then continue to rise in line with life expectancy			0
dr @entity98 criticised the government target last night , saying it was unrealistic for retirement age to rise by six months every year			0
she said : ‘ if it continued at that rate , it would reach 80 in 30 years			2
‘ i do not think the government should be aiming for any ‘ magic age ’ at which people should retire			0
‘ they should recognise individual differences and choices which enable one person to work until their 80s while others may be genuinely ill and unable to continue beyond their 60s			0
‘ the general direction of travel is towards later retirement but it is dangerous to put a figure on it			0
’ a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ older people have worked hard and paid into the system all their lives			1
that is why our reforms are securing the long - term future of the @entity87 – so it remains strong and keeps pace with increasing life expectancy			0
