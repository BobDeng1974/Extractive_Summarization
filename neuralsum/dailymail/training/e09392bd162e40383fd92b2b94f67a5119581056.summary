@entity0 has warned against @entity1 spending £ 34million on @entity2 as he would rather the club spend that amount of money on a striker who would score 30 goals a season			1
in his latest @entity12 blog , the @entity10 legend lamented @entity15 's @entity14 performance - highlighting the damage the influx of foreign players has had on the @entity19 detrimentally			2
the 39 - year - old has baulked at the @entity19 's influx of foreign players - labelling @entity15 's top flight as a ' cash cow ' - as prices of young @entity27 talent continue to inflate and therefore stifling their opportunities to develop as club 's opt for cheaper foreign imports			1
' the proposed £ 34m transfer for the 18 - year - old @entity2 to @entity1 is another example of something which has a bad long - term impact , ' he said			0
' clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options - they ’re not better players			0
' for a left - back to be worth £ 34m shows how silly the game has gone			0
for that money i want a centre - forward who ’s going to score 30 goals a season			2
' @entity2 has been heavily linked with a summer move to @entity37 , following another impressive season at @entity38			0
the 18 - year - old 's display 's earned him a place in @entity70 's disappointing @entity14 squad - where he started in tuesday 's @entity71 0 - 0 dead rubber draw against @entity73			1
on the ball : @entity2 ( right ) started for @entity15 in their 0 - 0 draw vs @entity73 in their final @entity14 fixture video let me leave - @entity2			1

@entity1 should *n't* sign @entity38 's @entity2 for £ 34million warns @entity0
@entity0 says he would rather the club buy striker who would score 30 goals a season for that money
@entity0 added if @entity1 sign @entity2 it will force other clubs to buy cheap imports rather than bringing through young @entity27 talent
