shopping for clothes used to be so simple			2
you would stroll into a shop , pick up a few items , try them on in a changing room and then take them to the till if they looked alright on			2
now some chains are doing things a little differently			1
@entity9 and its offshoot , @entity11 , sell their clothes targeted at 14 - 18 year olds in the dark			1
the low lighting aims to give the shops a casino or @entity18 club - like feel , bathing their teenage customers in luxury			1
but parents are less impressed , complaining of bumping into tables , not being able to see colours or prices and - in at least one case - losing a child in the dark			2
what do teenagers see in the brand ? @entity9 workers - including the topless models who stand by the door - in the poorly - lit flagship store it is not just the lighting that disappoints			1
the ear - splittingly loud music helps add to the exclusive atmosphere , and the clothes are even sprayed with an intoxicating scent that lingers long after you have left the store			2
and there 's also the unusual experience of walking past a couple of models in swimsuits on your way into the shop - whatever the weather			2
teenagers queue up to get their photos taken with the six - packed sales assistants while everyone else cringes			0
fortunately , the darkness spares some of everyone 's blushes			0
@entity62 , 51 , from @entity63 lost her daughter in the shop			0
she said : ' i went to look somewhere else and i just could n't find her when i turned around because it 's so dark			0
i had to come out and phone her			0
' another mother , @entity69 , added : ' when we go in i cling to my daughters and say , " do n't lose me "			0
' @entity73 @entity72 , 30 , from @entity74 , said of @entity11 in the bullring shopping centre : ' i ca n't see the sizes , i ca n't see the prices , i ca n't see the till - i ca n't see the point			1
' dark and mysterious : the @entity11 store in @entity74 's @entity82 shopping centre @entity11 customer @entity69 said : ' when we go in i cling to my daughters and say , " do n't lose me " ' are you intimidated by clothes shops your teens love ? are you intimidated by clothes shops your teens love ? now share your opinion the sales strategy has sparked @entity91 groups including ' turn up the lights and turn down the music @entity94 ! , ' and ' welcome to @entity11 , would you like a torch ? ' teenager @entity96 wrote on one of the group 's message boards : ' my mate bought a pink checked top , turns out to be orange			1
' @entity102 added : ' the thing is if @entity11 ca n't afford lights , where does the hundred quid i spend every time i go in go ? ' a spokesperson for @entity11 refused to comment on the issue			1
but one worker said : ' it creates an atmosphere that allows you to come in and hang out while finding some cool clothes			0
' it gives a type of casino - feel , where people can get lost in a club - like environment , people relax , and hopefully spend more			0
' it 's clearly working : @entity11 opened its first @entity122 store in 2008			1
it now has 22 @entity122 outlets , with more to come , much to the delight off its teenage fans darkness is part of the brand : @entity130 wrote on @entity91 , ' i do n't think i 'd want them to fix the lights ' cause with different lights it just would n't be @entity11 ! ' @entity136 , who worked for the company for three years commented : ' stores such as @entity9 and @entity11 , both owned by the @entity9 , focus a lot on providing a certain atmosphere to the customer			1
' by having low lights , a signature fragrance spritzed on the clothes , and maybe louder music than most stores , @entity9 sets itself apart from other clothing stores			1
' loud music and strong smells just add to that exclusive - feeling experience			0
the perfume , in particular reminds customers of the shop long after they have gone elsewhere			0
the tactic was pushed to new limits in @entity157 , @entity158			0
when a new @entity9 flagship store opened there , even the streets were sprayed with the scent			1
and it all seems to be working			0
@entity11 opened its first @entity122 store in 2008			1
it now has 22 @entity122 outlets , with more to come			0
there is often a queue outside its stores helping to make the clothes even more desirable			2
and darkness has already become part of the brand			0
as @entity130 comments on @entity91 : ' i do n't think i 'd want them to fix the lights ' cause with different lights it just would n't be @entity11 !			1
