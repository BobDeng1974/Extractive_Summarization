' @entity52 columnist @entity51 said there was no real reason for @entity8 to be there in the first place			1
speaking on @entity58 's the lead he said : ' and he should have been invited why ? he should have been invited to speak for what reason ? he 's one of 50 senators			2

' their victory was great			0
but we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete			0

' that tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge , she 's marching			2
' that successful businessman who does n't have to but pays his workers a fair wage and offers a shot to a man , maybe an ex-con , who 's down on his luck , he 's marching			2
' the mother who pours her love into her daughter so she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same doors as anybody 's son , she 's marching			2

' the battle scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again and walk again and run again but to keep serving their country when they come home , they are marching			0
