when it launched eight years ago , cruise company @entity0 decided to make a name for itself , literally			2
the founders took ' aza ' for ' blue ' - think azure ; and added ' mara ' , which has a hint of the maritime about it			2
and then , for good measure , they bolted on ' @entity13 '			2
the thinking behind ' club ' was that it suggested exclusivity			2
the line - part of the @entity19 group - has two ships in its fleet , @entity22 and @entity23 , which each carry about 680 passengers			2
the smaller size of the vessels means not only a more intimate on - board experience - as in @entity29 bar , it can become a place where everybody who serves you soon knows your name - it also means the ships can access ports off - limits to the bigger vessels			1
i boarded our seven - night @entity23 cruise from @entity40 to @entity41 with a sense of great expectations : i anticipated a friendly ambience , great service and some interesting ports			1
i was n't to be disappointed			2
the @entity0 ' quest vessel carries about 680 passengers , making it a more intimate voyage the size of the ship means it is able to access ports that are off - limits to the bigger vessels boarding the ship in somewhere as glitzy as @entity40 immediately imbued the journey with a luxury feel			1
in the harbour we were surrounded on all sides by billionaires ' mega-yachts			0
but while they and their guests were probably having to fork out vast amounts for their onboard food and drink , on the @entity23 we were living in the lap of complimentary luxury			0
you can enjoy ' standard spirits , international beers and wines at all ship bars during regular bar hours ' for no extra charge - and ' gratuities ' on @entity0 are included in the basic cost			1
there is also an unfeasibly wide selection of on - board eating places - there is a @entity82 - like feel to the way that something that looks small from the outside can accommodate so much on the inside			0
our first stop was @entity88 , which seemed to boast even more stunning luxury yachts than @entity40			1
in the evening we joined a small party for a special excursion - @entity0 prides itself on offering a variety of experiences throughout its cruises - to an ' elegant evening under the stars ' at a favourite celeb hangout , the five - star @entity97			0
we gathered around the handsome swimming pool to sip fine champagne and scoff sumptuous mini-pastries as we watched the sun sink into the @entity103			0
@entity104 boarded a seven - night @entity23 cruise from @entity40 to @entity41 with high expectations the first stop was @entity88 , which seemed to boast even more stunning luxury yachts than @entity40 it was a good time to get early impressions on the cruise from fellow passengers			1
everyone was impressed at the high quality of service and facilities - especially those whose previous cruise experiences had been on ' big ' ships			0
there were high marks for dining , service , decor , the interesting choice of excursions and the excellent value for money			0
' we were worried @entity0 might be too small , ' said one couple			0
' in fact we should have been worried by the fact that our previous trips had been on ships which were too large			0
we 're sticking with ships this size from now on			0
' the days flew by			0
there were two ports in @entity137 : @entity138 and @entity139			1
famous for its salt pans , @entity139 offered another treat - the @entity141 evening ( there is one on every cruise ) , a large , free - of - charge party with masses of food , wine and entertainment laid on at a nearby beach that we reached in a fleet of coaches			1
it felt as if we were gatecrashing an exclusive private party			0
famous for its salt pans , @entity139 offered another treat - a large free - of - charge private party the cruises attracted a wide spread of age groups , from people in their 30s up to their 80s			1
the accent was on keeping busy , whether by taking interesting excursions or attending well - thought - out lectures on board			0
but if you did n't want to do anything , there were always spare sunloungers and plenty of space to stretch out next to the pool			0
after a fine stop at @entity176 , it was on to @entity177 for @entity178 and our final stop at @entity181			1
i woke early to be up on deck as the ship followed the coast road past @entity186			1
it was so quiet that as we sailed past the small villages , you could hear bells calling people to morning @entity193 @entity104 woke early to be up on deck as the ship followed the coast road past quiet @entity186 in @entity181 we caught the local bus up to @entity197 - once a favourite place with the @entity199 elite - to enjoy the stunning views along the coast , and then sauntered back down the footpath through lemon trees and sweet - smelling shade until we were back in @entity181			1
our final excursion was one that promised ' @entity206 ' - a drive along the spectacular @entity208 to a buffalo farm in @entity210 to discover how mozzarella cheese is made			1
a bus up to former @entity199 elite favourite @entity197 is rewarded with coastal views such as this one of the happy @entity216 water buffalo that provide the milk for creamy and delicious mozzarella @entity0 ( 0844 493 4016 ) offers an eight - night @entity103 cruise aboard the quest from Â£ 2,285pp including return flights from @entity222 , transfers , club balcony cabin and full board			1
departing october 15 , it calls at @entity226 and @entity227 , @entity41 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232			1
i 'm not sure what sort of picture i had in my head of the buffaloes from which the milk is taken in order to make the famous @entity177 cheese , but the big - horned @entity216 water buffaloes we met came as something of a surprise			0
the farm we visited was a showpiece with a big herd of cheerful animals , and after watching the manufacturing process we were whisked off to the owners ' farmhouse where we were able to sample the goods in rural splendour			2
on our return to the ship there was time to reflect on a pleasurable week at sea			2
the company 's name may mean ' blue sea ' - for me i will always remember it as ' my blue heaven ' .			0

the smaller ship proves more intimate and can access more ports
stops included @entity88 , @entity139 , @entity176 and @entity181
