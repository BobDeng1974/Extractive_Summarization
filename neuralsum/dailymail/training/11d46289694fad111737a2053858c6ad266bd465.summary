an @entity1 car mechanic has invented a potentially life - saving device that could be used to help deliver babies when complications occur during labour			1
@entity6 , 59 , designed the instrument which could be safer than forceps , a ventouse , or a caesarean section , in a non-hospital setting			0
the @entity12 uses a polyethylene sleeve , fixed around the baby 's head , to pull the child down the birth canal			1
@entity6 , 59 , designed an instrument , called the @entity12 ( pictured ) , which could be safer than forceps , a ventouse , or a caesarean section , in a non-hospital setting it can be used to grip a baby stuck in the birth canal and pull it free here @entity27 demonstrates how a plastic bag filled with air can be used to extract a cork from a bottle , the trick that inspired him mr @entity6 , who has no medical background , says he came up with the idea after seeing a @entity37 video of a person removing a cork from a wine bottle using just a plastic bag			1
he says that after seeing this trick , he realised the principle could also be applied to help women struggling during labour			0
he says the thought hit him in the middle of the night and he woke up his wife to tell her about it , but that she just told him to go back to sleep			0
despite her dismissal , mr @entity6 began work on the design and it is now the subject of a @entity58 approved study			0
the device is cheap to produce and can be used by midwives with minimal training			0
it is currently being tested in @entity1 and rural @entity63 by the @entity58 the device has to be placed on the baby 's head using an ' inserter ' ( pictured )			1
it has a shaped end which ensures it is put in the right place once the device is in place , the birth attendant slips a polyethylene sleeve over the babies head and inflates it to secure it in place it is being tested in @entity1 and in rural @entity63 to establish whether it could act as a safe and feasible birth aid for use by midwives with minimal training			2
if it is brought into widespread use , mr @entity6 says the gadget could be the first innovation in operative vaginal delivery since the development of forceps centuries ago			0
the @entity12 allows a birth attendant to place a plastic ' bell ' on the baby ’s head before sliding a polyethylene sleeve along the birth canal and around the baby 's head			1
once the sleeve is in place , the midwife can remove the plastic ' inserter ' ( pictured ) the midwife can then use the sleeve to pull the baby down the birth canal			2
the sleeve is lubricated meaning the baby comes out as easily as possible when it is in place , a small amount of air can be pumped into the sleeve to secure it around the baby 's head			2
the plastic inserter is then removed and the midwife can use the sleeve to deliver the baby 's head			1
the sleeve is lubricated to make the delivery easier			0
as the device reduces the amount of contact between the baby ’s head and the birth canal it is thought it could also reduce the incidence of infections acquired during delivery .			2

@entity6 says the @entity12 could help deliver babies safely when complications arise during labour in areas with poor medical *facilities*
it is safer and easier to use than forceps or a ventouse
allows the midwife to slide a polythene sleeve around the baby 's head , inflate it to hold it in place , and then pull the baby down the birth canal
it is currently being tested by the @entity58
