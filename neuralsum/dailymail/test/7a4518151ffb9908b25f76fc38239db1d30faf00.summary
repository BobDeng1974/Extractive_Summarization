@entity1 midfielder @entity0 has warned that they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on qualifying for next season 's @entity4			1
spurs are sixth in the @entity6 , which would bring @entity8 qualification , but there has been talk in the past that @entity13 's second - tier competition does them more harm than good			1
@entity0 says the benefits of qualifying outweigh the negatives , though , and admits that the prospect of @entity4 football played a big part when he decided to move to @entity22 in 2013			1
@entity0 has warned @entity1 they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on @entity13 @entity0 says the benefits of qualifying for the much - maligned @entity4 outweigh the negatives the lack of @entity28 football - which @entity1 have missed out on since the 2010 - 11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top - class players for clubs of @entity1 's size , but @entity0 says missing out on the @entity4 would have the same effect			1
' is it a factor when the club are trying to sign players ? i think so , ' @entity0 said			2
' it certainly was for me when i moved from @entity40 two years ago			0
' i always want to play in @entity13 , to be seen on that stage or in the @entity6			0
it was a big chance and for me it was a nice thing when i came to @entity1			0
' @entity1 have been linked with @entity44 midfielder @entity43 and @entity45 forward @entity46 , and @entity0 worries that @entity1 could have to lower their sights if they are not on the @entity8 stage next season			1
@entity51 's side currently sit sixth in the @entity6 , which is enough to qualify @entity0 says the lure of @entity4 football was important in his decision to join @entity1 back in 2013 and while he admits that missing out makes finishing higher up the table easier , @entity0 does n't see many issues with the competition itself			1
' i 'd rather play in @entity13 than nothing , ' he told the @entity61			0
' there are many games , of course , but if you have a big squad as we have , it should n't be a disappointment to play in @entity13			0
a lot of players want to be in @entity13			0
we 've been fighting to get into the top four and we still have a little chance			0
@entity43 ( right ) , the @entity44 midfielder , is one player who has been linked with a move to @entity1 @entity45 's @entity46 is thought to be another target for @entity1 in the summer market ' of course , it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in @entity13			2
there are so many games and we have played more games than most teams in the @entity6 this season			0
' as it stands , the @entity6 's top six will all qualify for @entity13 but if @entity85 win the @entity87 final against @entity88 that number would extend to the seventh - placed side			1
@entity91 could also find themselves in the @entity4 next season if they qualify via the @entity93 .			2

@entity1 are sitting sixth in the @entity6 after a long season
that place would see them qualify for the @entity4 next year
but in the past it has been said to cause them more harm than good
@entity0 says he wants to qualify as it helps attract top players
@entity1 's @entity4 *participation* was a factor in the @entity110 signing
