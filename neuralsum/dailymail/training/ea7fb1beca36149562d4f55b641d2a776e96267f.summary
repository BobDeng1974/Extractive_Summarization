by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 28 january 2013 it was not so long ago that we had to exchange our old box televisions for flat - screens			1
and then there were the endless upgrades to high definition and screens that could show 3d images			1
but it seems it could all have be in vain as the technology is already out of date through the arrival of the @entity16 picture			2
however , for those wishing to view the latest picture in their own living room , they must have plenty of room available for the 84inch screen and plenty of spare cash			1
@entity41 has brought out a model that is more than 7ft wide and can play the new technology			2
costing Â£ 25,000 , only @entity44 in central @entity45 currently sells the television			2
@entity47 has reportedly bought three and a @entity49 prince has ordered six			1
the giant screen can convert ordinary television into @entity52 , and comes with five pairs of glasses for viewing the pin - sharp images			1
even without @entity52 , the ultra-high definition images are 16 times sharper than those on a normal television			1
experts say the television 's picture is so technologically advanced that few broadcasters can yet take advantage of its full potential			0
experts say the television 's picture is so technologically advanced that few broadcasters can yet take advantage of its full potential it may also solve family arguments			0
the screen is so large that it can be split , allowing viewers to watch two movies at once - and it has voice - activated and motion controls , putting an end to fruitless searches for the remote			1
those preferring something more discreet might wish to wait for the 65 - inch version or even the dinky 55 - inch , which will be in the shops this summer			0
the emergence of @entity16 comes as the @entity83 is preparing to film it 's next meerkat natural history programme using the new technology			0
the series , being made by the @entity83 's @entity88 in @entity89 , will show how animals go through the same basic life stages as humans			0
' we are looking at six ages of man as seen through animal lives , ' @entity93 , creative director of the @entity88 , told @entity98			0
' it 's looking at the trials and tribulations that animals face at different stages of their lives and how different species have different solutions - from birth , to growing up , to adolescence , to finding their first home , to finding their place in the social hierarchy , to getting a mate and finally having offspring of their own			0
' there 's a new reality which those images give			1
i think it makes the images more engaging			2
you feel you can almost touch them and get into the heads of the animals			0
