it used to be that surrogacy was considered an option exclusively for infertile couples , but it appears more and more women are doing it for less medically urgent reasons			1
according to @entity8 , ' social surrogacy ' is on the rise , with mothers choosing not to carry their baby themselves in order not to upset their work life or ' ruin ' their bodies			1
' i call these cases designer surrogacy , ' said @entity19 - based fertility doctor @entity18 , whose patients have included a socialite ' who did n't want to get fat ' and a runner about to do a marathon			1
to have or not to have : ' @entity26 surrogacy ' is on the rise , with more and more mothers choosing not to carry their baby themselves in order not to upset their work life or ' ruin ' their bodies dr @entity18 explained that pregnancy can also be a financial hindrance to women , since it can mean a months - long pause in their career			1
' some women work right up to the moment they deliver , but others can be bedridden for several months , ' she said			0
that was the reason wedding photographer @entity41 , who chose not to reveal her real name to the magazine , began considering surrogacy			1
at 36 , @entity41 had been putting off having a baby with her husband because business was finally booming , and she could n't bear to risk wrecking it			1
what 's more , she was working 60 hours a week to build her brand and says she simply did n't have time for pregnancy , much less potential complications like morning sickness or being put on bed rest			1
with her baby clock ticking louder and louder , she spoke with a clinical psychologist friend named @entity58 who owns a surrogacy agency called @entity60			1
frustrated with all the complicated fertility math and ovulation tracking involved in trying to perfectly time her own pregnancy , @entity41 joked : ' i wish i could just use a surrogate			2
' ' i could be out of work for months			0
people could forget about me			0
i have to be out there producing and being visible ' surprisingly , her friend was encouraging , and what started as a joke became an option she was determined to carry out			0
even though the approximate total cost of surrogacy is a staggering $ 100,000 , @entity41 sees it as the best and most reliable way for her and her husband to finally expand their family			1
and the fact that childbirth itself is painful and can affect the body certainly was something of a factor			0
indeed , after visiting a friend who told her she 'd been ripped ' head to toe ' after delivering her ten - pound baby , @entity41 was horrified			2
' oh @entity87 ! ' she wrote in an e-mail to @entity58			0
' i do n't want to go through that if i do n't have to			2
' risk of judgement : rumors abounded when @entity93 announced in 2009 that she and @entity94 were ' happily anticipating the birth of their twin daughters ... with the generous help of a surrogate ' @entity41 is one of a growing number of women who are choosing not to carry their own baby , even if they are medically capable of doing so			0
while it may seem somewhat morally questionable , the guidelines for surrogacy are vague and not always binding			2
indeed , according to the @entity108 , surrogacy should be used only ' when a true medical condition precludes the intended parent from carrying a pregnancy or would pose a significant risk of death or harm to the woman or the fetus			1
' but the definition of ' harm ' can vary from doctor to doctor , with some saying psychological setbacks - like the fear of being pregnant - are reason enough			1
@entity124 , a doctor at @entity125 in @entity126 , says he 's overseen about 20 ' social ' cases			2
' they 're for reasons most people would find offensive , ' he explained , adding : ' i do n't ask these patients too many questions because i do n't want them to feel judged			1
' celebrity mom : @entity135 faced some skepticism after she and @entity137 paid a gestational carrier to give birth to their daughter @entity140 ( left ) in 2010 and judgement is certainly an issue for women who opt for surrogacy , with some people assuming they 're doing it to maintain their figure or work life			2
rumors abounded , for instance , when @entity93 announced in 2009 that she and @entity94 were ' happily anticipating the birth of their twin daughters ... with the generous help of a surrogate '			0
' they 're reasons most people would find offensive			0
i do n't ask these patients too many questions because i do n't want them to feel judged ' and @entity135 faced some skepticism after she and @entity137 paid a gestational carrier to give birth to their daughter @entity165 in 2008			1
of course , both of these women were in their forties at the time , when pregnancy is significantly more dangerous for both the mother and the fetus			0
for @entity41 , the risk of judgement by her peers or her family members ( her husband 's mother is far from impressed to have a ' stranger ' carry her grandchild ) are outweighed by the benefits of surrogacy			0
' i could be out [ of work ] three or four months , ' she said of conceiving naturally			0
' people could forget about me			0
i have to be out there constantly producing and being visible			0

@entity19 - based fertility doctor @entity18 says her patients have included a socialite who ' did n't want to get fat ' and a runner with an *upcoming* marathon
