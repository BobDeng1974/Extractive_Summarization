an archeological treasure trove unearthed by a team from the @entity2 could transform our understanding of @entity5			1
the most significant artifacts uncovered are two carved ducks , the first of their kind to be found in @entity10 and the oldest figurines ever hewn from the @entity10			1
the ducks were likely , say the team , to be a result of the @entity16 tradition of carving animal figurines which were then thrown into water as offerings			1
quacking find : these two stone carvings in the shape of ducks , dated to around @entity24 , were discovered near @entity5 and are thought to be the oldest ever unearthed in @entity10 amazing find : a trove of artifacts unearthed near @entity5 suggests there were humans at the site for 3,000 years before the monument was built but while the ducks date back to @entity24 , a ceremonial dagger was also found which originated around @entity34			1
however , another item which @entity36 initially believed was a cow 's tooth was revealed by radiocarbon dating to date back to around @entity41 , some 3,000 years before work began on @entity5			1
it was part of a tranche of more than 200 animal bones that were buried alongside evidence of a large fire , suggesting a @entity48 feast for up to 100 people			1
the bones transpired not to be from cows but instead from aurochs , a now extinct animal about the size of a buffalo			2
' it 's probably one the earliest recorded hot meals in @entity59 too , with these people likely cooking this huge creature , ' @entity2 tutor @entity36 , who led the field work , told @entity62			2
the @entity48 era is essentially the mid-period of the stone age			2
it is sandwiched between the other two ' lithics ' - @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and the @entity69 ( @entity69 )			2
in @entity71 , the @entity48 period covered the period from around @entity73 to 5000bc			2
however , given that civilisation developed at different paces on different continents , it took place in @entity79 between 14,000bc - 400bc and in @entity80 between @entity81 and @entity82			0
it is also sometimes referred to as the @entity85 era			0
further excavations revealed a hoarde of more than 5,500 worked flints and tools			0
given that only a few @entity48 items had ever previously been found around @entity5 , the discovery is strong evidence of the continuity of human life at the site			1
that means @entity5 could have been a site of great significance to humans for several thousand years before the monument was built			1
mr @entity36 , who runs a course on @entity102 , used his @entity2 students to excavate a site north east of the @entity105 known as @entity106			0
digging down into the bed of a former spring revealed a trove of artifacts , though the team did not immediately recognise the significance of their find			0
mystical spot : @entity5 remains a spiritual site attended by pagans for ceremonies such as the solstice in summer and winter , and appears to have been that way for since @entity41 two examples of the flint tools uncovered at the site near @entity5 last year the team dug a trench in the south east corner of the spring and discovered a late @entity127 layer , an @entity129 layer and an early @entity16 layer before uncovering the flint tools			0
initially the team believed it was a mixed cache of early prehistoric tools , contemporary with @entity5			0
but once the lab work was underway and experts at @entity138 , where mr @entity36 is studying for a phd , suggested the finds were all @entity48 , the team realised the magnitude of their find			0
' it 's not a surprise because we new there was a @entity48 monument there somewhere , because of the ( totem ) posts that were found during the excavation of the car park some years ago , ' said mr @entity36			1
' the massive missing link between those two things has been that there is no evidence of people using them until now			1
excavations : @entity2 tutor @entity36 , who led the expedition , with part of the pelvis of an auroch and , right , one of the early trenches dug on the site ' but what is surprising is that a little team like us with a very low budget have discovered it			1
' the find is now the property of the landowners sir @entity173 and @entity174 , who gave mr @entity36 permission to carry out the excavation			0
however , there are plans for a new museum to be built in the local town of @entity181 , largely on the back of this discovery , and the artifacts could be housed at that museum , when it is completed			1
in keeping with the @entity2 tradition , mr @entity36 is keen to have the local community involved , and that approach is ultimately what yielded the historic find			0
before commencing the work he consulted the custodian of the site for 33 years , @entity195 , and asked where he thought merited exploration			2
mr @entity195 suggested three sites , of which the spring was most likely to bear archaeological fruit in mr @entity36 ' opinion			0
' @entity195 is someone who , if you ask for his advice , he will be very generous , but i do n't think anyone else had ever asked his opinion before , ' said mr @entity36 .			0

duck figurines are oldest ever found in @entity10 and part of significant archeological haul
evidence human *gathered* at the monument for up to 3,000 years before it was built
