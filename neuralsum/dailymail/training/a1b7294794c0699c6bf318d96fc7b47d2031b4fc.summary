by @entity1 reporter published : 10:37 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 10:46 est , 25 december 2012 a @entity3 couple are fighting to win back custody of a three - year - old @entity5 they adopted as a baby , after the @entity8 ruled she should be handed back to her biological father due to ' tribal rights '			1
@entity11 , a member of the @entity12 , had never met his daughter before picking her up in his truck in december 2011 , and had even told the girl 's biological mother that he did not want her			2
but after finding out the woman , who is not a @entity18 , had given the girl up for adoption , he invoked the @entity21 of 1978 , which gives @entity23 parents preference in custody disputes			1
happy family : @entity27 and @entity28 with their adopted daughter @entity29 , who has been taken out of their custody and given to her biological father as he is @entity18 he won custody of the girl and her adoptive parents , @entity27 and @entity28 , have not seen her in a year as he has refused to allow them to contact her			1
now the @entity37 are fighting to win back their daughter , @entity29 , and in turn , they are battling the controversial federal law that has taken her away			1
' no one can believe that this nightmare can happen in @entity43 , ' @entity28 told the @entity44 last month			2
' we live in total grief			0
' the @entity47 had ruled for @entity11 to have custody even though it called the @entity37 ' ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment			2
' but the law was put in place to be sensitive to distinctive aspects of native american culture and to protect children following cases of abuse against children from tribes , the @entity53 reported			2
battle : @entity29 , who is now three , was taken by her biological father , @entity11 ( right ) , last december and the @entity37 have not seen her since			1
he had originally said he wanted nothing to do with her while family courts usually base their decisions on the best interests of the child , the 1978 law notes other factors should be considered and the tribe 's interest in the child is equal to that of the parents			1
the @entity37 believe the law has gone too far , and question whether a man who previously showed no interest in his child should take custody simply because of he is @entity18			0
' there was no transition period , nothing for @entity29 , ' @entity28 said			1
' we were ordered to hand her over and that was it			0
' we ca n't understand how she was given no time to adjust or even meet her birth father in advance of him taking her back to @entity93			0
' new home : before @entity29 's birth , @entity11 gave up his parental rights and her mother put her up for adoption missed : but on hearing that @entity29 , pictured , was up for adoption , the father changed his mind with the decision causing outrage , @entity102 , the former @entity43 solicitor general , and @entity104 , a founding member of the @entity105 , have filed a brief with the @entity43 @entity8 on behalf of the @entity37 to restore custody			1
while the @entity8 hears only about one per cent of cases that are submitted , the couple hopes that the @entity8 will be among those heard in 2013			0
@entity11 was given custody of @entity29 even though he told his former fiancee , while she was pregnant with the girl , that he wanted nothing to do with the baby - by text message			2
and in the ruling , one dissenting judge said @entity11 had ' turned his back on the joys and responsibilities of fatherhood at every turn ' , while another said his ' vanishing act triggered the adoption in the first instance '			0
fight : the @entity37 have questioned whether it is right for a man - who previously showed no interest in his daughter - take her back simply because he is @entity18 the @entity37 , who live in @entity135 , @entity3 , are in touch with the biological mother , who supports their parental rights , but @entity11 has not allowed them to contact @entity29			1
' the concern should not be with a tribe , or a community , a birth parent or an adoptive parent			0
it should always be with the child , ' @entity28 said			0
' this case is about fundamental justice for children			0
we are determined not to give up hope			0
