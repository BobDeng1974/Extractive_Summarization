by @entity1 reporter published : 05:56 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 06:57 est , 14 may 2013 just one month after being sacked by tv station @entity3 for swearing on his live presenting debut , @entity2 is back at work - as a barman			1
the former news anchor became a viral sensation after he spluttered ' f * * * * * * s * * * ' as he attempted to pronounce the name of the @entity12 winner ( @entity11 ) as he began his first broadcast			0
he was fired 24 hours later			2
the tv reporter is now working as a bar tender for $ 2.23 an hour plus tips at @entity18 's @entity17 and @entity19 in @entity20			1
' he added that he would continue to work behind the bar throughout the summer before he applies to any more tv presenting positions			1
although he lost his job at @entity3 , @entity2 did take advantage of his new found fame after the incident on april 21 , telling @entity41 on @entity42 that he now prefer to work for @entity43			1
talking about his now infamous first appearance on @entity3 , ' @entity2 told @entity41 he ‘ crawled in bed ’ after being told that his slip had been broadcast live			1
@entity47 found fame : @entity49 told @entity41 that he 'd jump at the chance to work at sports channel @entity43 if they offered him a job after his infamous swearing outburst @entity2 admitted to @entity41 that his first reaction after the swearing incident was to crawl into bed and call his parents ‘ i went home , crawled in bed and called my parents , ’ @entity2 admitted			1
‘ but the next day , you got ta pick yourself up , you got ta laugh at yourself and keep going			0
’ @entity2 proved a figure of fun for @entity41 and he had even devoted his top 10 list to the sacked anchor 's plight			1
several more gags were made at @entity2 ’s expense on the show , but @entity41 also offered words of encouragement during their chat and told him ' he would be just fine			1
' but when a cocky - sounding @entity2 made it clear he was hoping his moment of madness might turn into an offer of a bigger job ideally from @entity43 , @entity41 told him to forget it			1
‘ look , i 'm trying to get you the job back in @entity82 , forget about @entity43 , ’ said @entity41			1
‘ that ai n't gon na happen			0
you 're going back to @entity82			2
’ second chance : @entity49 , from @entity82 , @entity86 , also appeared on the @entity87 getting by : @entity2 did his best to laugh with the @entity89 anchors over the situation while still calling his gaffe inexcusable and fully expected to be fired like he was it was a busy couple of days for @entity2 following his blunder as he made appearances on both @entity95 and the today show			1
on @entity95 , the show 's control room bleeped @entity2 even when he did n’t swear as a joke			1
@entity100 explained it was a ‘ precautionary bleep			0
’ still @entity2 had the last laugh as the show hired him as celebrity correspondent for a night			1
@entity106 @entity105 told @entity2 , ‘ one thing about @entity109 , we believe in giving second chances , man			1
yesterday , we called for you			0
( @entity113 ) so , we have a challenge for you if you 're willing to accept it			0
we 're going to send you to cover the star - studded red - carpet premiere of @entity118 's new movie , @entity119			0
’ said @entity100 : ‘ now , should you choose to accept this mission , your job is to interview all the celebrities that you can and bring the tape back to us here tomorrow			2
are you up for it ? what do you think ? ’ spotlight : @entity129 also appeared on live with @entity100 and @entity105 @entity2 agreed			1
‘ yeah , ’ he said , adding , ‘ yeah , definitely			0
’ earlier on the today show he had revealed that at first he had no idea that his astonishing outburst had been broadcast live on air last sunday			2
' when i first saw the clip , it was gut - wrenching , ' @entity2 told the today show of those two words that first introduced him to @entity82 's evening news audience , as well as the rest of @entity142			1
' @entity143 * * * , ' @entity2 is heard just as the camera cut to him hiding his face at the anchor desk			2
' i did n't even know i said it on camera until my news director walked in on the third break , ' he said			0
his co-anchor appeared to stumble over his profanity but he says it was all a situation of the two of them being tossed to from the control room while caught off guard			2
off guard : @entity2 told the today show that he did n't have an ear piece and the control room cut to him and his co-anchor 30 seconds earlier than expected he says he had n't yet been given an ear piece by the station and his co-anchor had forgotten hers in her car			1
' i was looking down , i was going over my script , @entity167 my co-anchor happens to be looking at the camera and she notices the red light comes on , we actually came on 30 seconds early , ' he says			0
then when he saw several names he could n't pronounce related to the @entity12 winners in his upcoming script , ' fireball shot came right out of my mouth , ' he explained			0
' i fully expected that they would fire me ' he said while calling those two words ' inexcusable			0
i ’m a free agent			0
ca n’t help but laugh at myself and stay positive , ' @entity2 later wrote on @entity182 after first being suspended by the station and getting through what he described as a ' tough day			2
' opportunity : helping him out the anchors allowed @entity2 to toss to a commercial break as part of his new anchor reel ‘ i want to apologize for an incident that occurred prior to our early newscast this evening , when one of our employees used profanity on the air , ’ @entity191 , @entity3 wrote in an apology on the station 's @entity194 page on sunday			2
‘ he did not realize his microphone was on , but still , that 's no excuse			0
we train our reporters to always assume that any microphone is live at any time			0
unfortunately , that was not enough in this case			0
we ca n't take back what was said , ' she wrote			0
at the end of his interview @entity2 was given the privilege by @entity89 ’s @entity212 of teasing the next segments on today while throwing to a commercial break			1
