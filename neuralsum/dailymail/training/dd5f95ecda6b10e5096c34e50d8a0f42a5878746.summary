a video that appears to show a @entity2 rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead government soldier has been posted online in a horrific new propaganda stunt			2
the unverified clip , posted by a pro-government campaign group , claims to show a man - believed to be @entity9 , the well - known founder of @entity11 ' @entity10 - standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while ranting against president @entity14			1
using a knife , the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring : ' i swear to @entity22 we will eat your hearts and your livers , you soldiers of @entity14 the dog			1
' he then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite			1
it comes as @entity33 warned today he may still sanction military intervention in the war - torn nation amid growing evidence that @entity14 is using chemical weapons against his own people			1
horrific : the amateur video posted on the internet on sunday shows @entity44 , a founder of the rebel @entity10 who is well known to journalists as an insurgent from @entity11 , cutting into the torso of a dead soldier remorseless : after removing what appears to be the dead man 's heart , @entity53 then reaches into the chest cavity the video , posted on @entity56 by and billed as proof of a war crime , is the latest installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes of this bloody conflict			1
last month , a photograph was released by a @entity65 group based in @entity66 that appeared to show a young rebel fighter barbecuing the severed head of a government soldier			0
experts say such images demonstrate that the battlefield has spread from rubble - strewn streets and war - churned fields to the internet as both sides vie to control their public image and discredit that of their opposition			0
meanwhile , human rights groups say it is emblematic of a civil war that has rapidly descended into sectarian hatred and revenge killings			0
in the most recent video , @entity9 tells the camera : ' i swear to @entity22 we will eat your hearts and your livers , you soldiers of @entity14 the dog , ' his rant is greeted by offscreen cheers of his comrades shouting ' @entity97 ( @entity22 is great ) '			1
gory : brandishing the organs for the camera to see , @entity9 continues his rant against @entity14 's government earlier this year another sickening video showed a rebel leader eating the heart of a captured soldier pr war : the video , posted on @entity56 by and billed as proof of a war crime , is the latest installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes of this bloody conflict @entity115 of @entity116 said that he had seen an original , unedited copy of the video and that @entity9 's identity had been confirmed by rebel sources in @entity11 and by images of him in other videos wearing the same black jacket as in the latest clip and with the same rings on his fingers			1
' the mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime			0
but the even more serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and violence , ' said @entity115			0
he said that in the unedited version of the film , @entity9 instructs his men to ' slaughter the @entity139 and take their hearts out to eat them ' , before biting into the heart			1
@entity9 has been seen in previous videos firing rockets at @entity66 @entity145 villages on the border and posing with the body of a soldier purportedly from the @entity66 @entity145 militant @entity150 group , which is helping @entity14 's forces			2
big talks : meanwhile , @entity154 prime minister @entity33 said he was n't ruling out taking tougher action against @entity2 over growing evidence it was using chemical weapons , saying he planned to raise the matter with @entity160 as he met the @entity162 president today @entity163 can not independently verify videos from @entity2 , where access is restricted by the government and security constraints			1
meanwhile , @entity154 prime minister @entity33 said on monday he was n't ruling out taking tougher action against @entity2 over growing evidence it was using chemical weapons , saying he planned to raise the matter with @entity162 president @entity160			1
' certainly we have n't ruled out stepping up action in response to what seems to be happening on the ground , ' @entity33 told @entity176 radio			2
' the evidence is growing ; the lack of room for doubt is shrinking , and i think this is extremely serious			0
' @entity33 's comments came two days after he urged @entity184 president @entity183 to do more to stop the bloodshed in @entity2 , after failing to make any major progress towards ending the two - year conflict			2
speaking at a press conference in @entity190 , the prime minister said : ' the history of @entity2 is being written in the blood of her people			0
but mr @entity33 ’s visit to the @entity184 president 's summer residence in the @entity198 resort ended with an admission that they still have ' differing views ' about how to deal with the situation			2
shaky start : @entity33 and @entity184 president @entity183 exchanged pleasantries before a press conference today but failed to make real progress on resolving the @entity2 conflict mr @entity33 said @entity154 and @entity184 have ' differing views ' on how to resolve the conflict the @entity154 is leading the argument to amend or lift restrictions to allow weapons to be passed to forces opposed to @entity14 's regime			2
but @entity184 has remained supportive of the @entity2 government , with mr @entity183 determined to defend the country 's ' sovereignty '			0
the visit came as details emerged of @entity154 ’s arguments in favour of lifting the arms embargo			0
ahead of his visit mr @entity33 said the atrocities in @entity2 ‘ continue to mount ’ and growing evidence that the @entity228 regime has used chemical weapons			1
he told @entity230 : ‘ there is a growing body of limited but persuasive information showing that the regime has used , and continues to use , chemical weapons including sarin			1
the room for doubt about that continues to diminish			0
’ the @entity2 conflict started with peaceful protests in march 2011 , but when these were suppressed it gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which , according to one opposition monitoring group , has cost more than 80,000 lives			0
@entity245 lead the revolt , while @entity14 - whose family have ruled for over four decades - gets his core support from his own @entity139 sect , an offshoot of @entity145 .			0

rebel is believed to be @entity9 , a founder of the rebel @entity10
@entity9 rants : ' i swear we *'ll* eat from your hearts and livers , you dogs '
he then raises one of the organs to his mouth and takes a bite
@entity33 warns he may send troops as evidence of chemical weapons grows
