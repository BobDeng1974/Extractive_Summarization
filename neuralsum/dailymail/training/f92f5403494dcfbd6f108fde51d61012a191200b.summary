and one in three say he should not be locked up at all			2
the results of the @entity23 poll come amid continuing controversy over the jailing of the @entity4 , who was dismissed in disgrace for a ‘ cold blooded killing ’ that had ‘ tarnished ’ the good name of the @entity30			2

‘ the highest standard of discipline must be maintained in the @entity52 and this man obviously committed an offence			0
