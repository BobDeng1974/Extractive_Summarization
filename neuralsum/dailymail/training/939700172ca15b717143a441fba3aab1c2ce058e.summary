an @entity1 explorer recently became the first person to make it to the world 's largest beaver dam , after trekking more than a week through 200 miles of unforgiving wilderness in northern @entity7			1
@entity8 , 44 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , successfully made it to the dam located in @entity14 's @entity13 on july 20 , braving ' horrific ' mosquitoes and dangerous swampland to be the first human to see the natural wonder in person			1
the beavers may have started construction on the 2,790 - foot - long dam in 1975 , but it was only discovered by researchers using @entity24 in october 2007			1
a first : @entity10 adventurer @entity8 recently became the first man to visit the world 's largest beaver dam in far northern @entity14 , @entity7 amazing find : the dam was discovered by researchers in october 2007 , who spotted it on @entity24 ' just to be able to be the first to walk somewhere where no one else did , it felt impressive			1
i was pretty impressed with myself , ' @entity8 told the @entity36			2
he says the most difficult part of the journey was battling the insatiable mosquitoes , which sounded like ' helicopters ' , and were worse than the bugs he faced spending a month in the @entity43			0
@entity8 wore a rain jacket the whole time , to stop the mosquitoes biting through his clothes , and spent the nights sleeping in a hammock , draped in bug netting			0
' just to be able to be the first to walk somewhere where no one else did , it felt impressive			0
i was pretty impressed with myself , ' @entity8 told the @entity36 the final mile of the journey was the most difficult , and took @entity8 five hours , since he had to keep himself from sinking into the constant waist - deep sludge			1
' every step you take is nerve - wracking because you do n’t know how deep you ’re going to sink in , and then your foot gets stuck and you have to lay down and pull it out			1
it ’s just really , really hard going			0
the entire time i would never take a step without holding on to a willow or some sort of foliage , ' @entity8 told @entity65			0
but it was worth the struggle to see the engineering marvel built by the industrious beaver colony			0
hard to see : @entity8 says the beaver dam does n't photograph well since it 's completely overgrown in foliage angry beaver : the whole day @entity8 spent at the dam , he only saw one beaver which slapped its tail against the water in anger ' it was the only hard ground around for miles so i was happy to stand on it , ' he said			1
however , the dam is a marvel to be witnessed in person , since it does n't photograph well			1
' when i got there i expected to see a big beautiful dam , ' @entity8 told @entity65			1
' it ’s huge , but it ’s not tall and there ’s nothing to take a picture of			0
it ’s completely covered with dirt and it ’s completely overgrown			0
so there was no nice beaver dam face to take a picture of or anything like that			1
' and for such a large dam , @entity8 only saw one beaver the entire day he was there			2
' it was incredibly angry when i was there , ' @entity8 told the @entity105			0
' it kept slapping its tail against the water			0
' the return trip only took @entity8 three days			0
it was his second attempt reaching the beaver dam			2
he failed to reach the dam two years ago , due to bad weather			2
the second largest beaver dam in the world is 2,139 feet and is located in @entity116 , @entity117			2
home : the highlighted aerial view of the dam above show the edge of the structure and the two lodges where the industrious beavers live			2

@entity126 44 , of @entity9 , @entity10 reached the 2,790 - foot - long dam in @entity14 , @entity7 on july 20
the dam was discovered by researchers using @entity24 in 2007
