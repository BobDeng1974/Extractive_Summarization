a 22 - year - old social networking pioneer and internet privacy advocate who dared to challenge @entity3 and @entity4 is dead			2
@entity7 died saturday after @entity9 police were summoned for a reported suicide , police spokesman officer @entity5 said			0
mr @entity7 was one of the founders @entity16 * , a new social networking service meant to give users more control of their information online , and sought to lure people away from bigger sites like @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity19			1
mr @entity7 and three friends , @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36 , launched a trial run of diaspora * last year that attracted the attention of the @entity40 and @entity41 and left the tech world buzzing			1
they were all students at @entity46 's @entity45 and mr @entity7 described himself on his @entity19 account as a ‘ free culture and open web enthusiast			2
now one of the four diaspora * bros. ’ despite their desire to compete with @entity3 , the company 's founder @entity52 praised the group , telling @entity56 last year : ' i think it is cool people are trying to do it			1
coder : mr @entity7 was obsessed with internet privacy , but focused on drawing ' normal ' people to his social network site ' i see a little of myself in them			2
it ’s just their approach that the world could be better and saying , " we should try to do it			0
" ' friends and fans of mr @entity7 have written tributes on @entity19 after hearing of his death , with one posting : ' death of a young entrepreneur is a great loss to the community			2
' mr @entity7 was n't the only programmer to achieve great things in his early years : the four students announced their software programme in april 2010 and raised more than $ 200,000 for the project through the online fundraising system @entity86			1
the project even inspired @entity3 co-founder and ceo @entity52 to donate money to the project			2
in november 2010 the foursome released a consumer alpha version of the programme , while still making further developments			0
diaspora * is based around privacy concerns related to centralised social networks by allowing users to set up their own servers to host content and then interact with others by sharing status updates , photographs and other data – much like @entity3			1
four friends : four @entity46 students launched diaspora * : ( from left to right ) @entity35 , @entity34 , @entity36 and @entity7 but diaspora * is different because sites like @entity3 and @entity4 store user data within their own networks and own whatever data users upload			1
admirer : @entity3 chairman and ceo @entity52 donated money to @entity16 * , even though the project aimed to put him out of business mr @entity7 was a hardcore computer programmer , obsessed with internet security and maintaining privacy online			1
but since he began working on diaspora * , he began focusing on user interfaces and started thinking about how to lure ' normal ' users away from @entity3			1
' we want to move people from websites that are not healthy to websites that are more healthy , because they ’re transparent , ' mr @entity7 told @entity126 last year			0
' even though a nontechnical person may not understand it , they ’ll know there ’s a community that has said , this is okay			0
' co-founder @entity36 told the @entity40 last year : ‘ in our real lives , we talk to each other			0
' we do n’t need to hand our messages to a hub			0
what @entity3 gives you as a user is n’t that hard to do			0
' all the little games , the little walls , the little chat , are n’t really rare things			0

one of four friends from @entity46 who launched diaspora * site , meant to *protect* users ' privacy
@entity151 raised more than $ 200,000 in donations
@entity52 praised his project
