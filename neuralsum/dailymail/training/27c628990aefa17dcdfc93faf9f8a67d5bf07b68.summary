under butler @entity1 said he was forced out of his £ 24,000 - a - year post looking after the heir to the throne and his wife , the @entity13 , at @entity14 , their country estate , last year			1
this happened after he refused to go to work for them at @entity19 , their official residence in @entity22			1
in legal papers submitted to an employment tribunal last year , mr @entity1 , 34 , who had served the prince since 2004 , said he was intimidated , threatened and treated as a ‘ pariah ’ by senior colleagues as a result , despite an ‘ exemplary ’ record			1
eventually he was diagnosed by his doctor with ‘ @entity31 ’ , which , it was said , caused him to suffer panic attacks when he was in a big city for any length of time			0
this led one unidentified member of the @entity4 to describe mr @entity1 as being ‘ too dangerous ’ to work with the prince and to ban him from direct contact with the @entity41			1
they are also said to have likened him to shotgun killer @entity8 , who sparked one of the biggest police manhunts in recent times when he attacked his ex-girlfriend and murdered her new partner			2
he also blinded policeman @entity8 , who hanged himself earlier this year			0
@entity8 eventually killed himself during a stand - off with police			2
when mr @entity1 launched his compensation claim last year @entity19 insisted that the post of under butler had been made redundant and that a relocation package had been made available to mr @entity1 but he declined			1
‘ we will be rebutting mr @entity1 ’s claim , ’ they said			1
however the @entity57 has now learned that the @entity4 has backed down on their threat , settled out of court with the former servant and expressed its ‘ regret ’ for the distress caused to him			2
it is thought they were keen to settle in light of the damage caused to the prince ’s public image by his former secretary , @entity69 , who took him to an employment tribunal in 2004			0
@entity2 and @entity71 : mr @entity1 says he holds the pair in the highest regard miss day lost her claim for unfair dismissal , after claiming that the prince ran an ‘ @entity83 ’ household in which anyone who ‘ did n’t know their place ’ risked victimisation			1
@entity19 yesterday confirmed that mr @entity1 ’s case was settled ‘ amicably ’ before it reached the tribunal but declined to comment further			1
a spokesman for the former butler , who still lives in a cottage on the @entity14 estate with his partner , who also works for the @entity91 , said : ‘ mr @entity1 and the @entity4 have reached a mutually acceptable agreement on confidential terms in order to bring to an end the @entity97 proceedings and other matters relating to mr @entity1 ’s employment			1
‘ the household regrets the upset caused to mr @entity1 when he was made redundant			2
’ mr @entity1 told the @entity57 that while he could not discuss details of the case , he wanted to make clear that he had the highest regard for @entity2 and @entity71 personally			2
since the conclusion of his action against the royal household he has started his own business , @entity109 , which organises fine dining events , etiquette dinners and butlering tuition			0
the scot from a council estate in @entity115 , @entity116 , said he had dreamed of working for the @entity117 after watching tv documentaries such as @entity119 ‘ my father worked in the storerooms for @entity122 and my mother had a series of jobs until she got a post as a housekeeper at a big country house in @entity129 when i was 18 , ’ he said ‘ i began working alongside the butler there			0
' regal : @entity14 , the country estate of the @entity91 and the @entity13 in the late - 1990s , mr @entity1 applied to work for the 13th @entity132 at @entity133 after watching the @entity135 series filmed there , @entity137 , and featured several times in subsequent series			1
after three years he was poached by @entity2 after his brother , who worked as a footman for the @entity142 , recommended him			0
the future king interviewed him personally and mr @entity1 was so well liked by his royal boss that it was even suggested he was being groomed to become prince @entity147 ’s valet			1
‘ when you are a butler you are working with your employer in a very intimate capacity , so they have to be able to trust you , ’ he said			0
‘ it was the best job anyone could have had			0
‘ i met the @entity142 on several occasions and even danced a @entity157 with her and the @entity91 at one of the @entity159 at @entity160			0
it was one of the most amazing moments of my life			0
‘ it was also at @entity160 that i almost ran over one of the @entity142 ’s corgis when i was invited out to ride on the estate			0
@entity142 was standing there , in her headscarf , and fortunately just smiled at me			0
’ mr @entity1 said the demand for his services since leaving the prince ’s employ had been overwhelming			1
‘ the most popular service is teaching people dining etiquette , hosting dinner parties and afternoon teas and the like			0
