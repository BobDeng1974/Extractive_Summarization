eight months since qualification and @entity1 feels @entity2 are ready			1
‘ it ’s time to walk the walk , ’ says the captain , game - face on , at ease with his leadership responsibilities			1
there will be butterflies in the bellies in the dressing room in @entity13			1
young players at their first @entity15 like @entity16 will look up , see @entity1 and feel better that he is the man who will lead them on to the pitch			1
‘ it is here now , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ all the distances and the miles we have covered , the heat preparation , we ’ve done all that			2
there are no excuses now			1
it is time to walk the walk			2
in every tournament , the @entity27 leave the players with no excuses and maybe it ’s 99.9 per cent right			1
this time they ’ve put everything in place and done everything possible for the players to perform			1
you are with your team , your squad , and you have to have belief in what we are going into the tournament with			2
i think we are in a good place			2
’ the six months since the draw , which threw @entity2 into @entity56 with @entity41 , @entity57 and @entity58 , have been encouraging			1
@entity41 have not won a game and @entity57 ’s @entity60 has had knee surgery			1
and @entity43 ’s team has evolved , refreshed with youngsters			2
no 1 goalkeeper @entity64 reclaimed his place at @entity66 and centre forward @entity67 has been prolific			2
‘ this is the most difficult and the most pressurised stage to deliver on , both personally and as a group , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it is all right having all the ability and talent , but it is also being cute , clever and having that knowledge of how to beat these sides			2
‘ everyone has a good blend of players , everyone will think they ’ve prepared right and then it boils down to who wants it the most ; who gets the small details right ; who has that bit of luck			1
‘ are we going to be lucky ? will the small details and the referee decisions go our way ? we will have to wait and see			2
all we can control we have done			0
it is not just about the 11			0
a lot of things around can be big factors			0
we have a good staff , it ’s like a tree with @entity43 and @entity99 at the top and down to the pillars in the dressing room , experienced players who have been there			2
relief : the @entity2 squad , including @entity106 , train on friday night in the north of @entity108 @entity109 : but @entity1 conceded that the ' fearless ' @entity2 youngsters will need guidance ‘ no doubt about it , these young lads are going to need a bit of guidance			1
‘ there will be times when they help us with a bit of energy or legs or a sprint back and that is why it becomes so important that everyone pulls together			0
‘ the confidence and belief we would get if we do get the right result could be massive			0
we have to be clever and cute			0
people talk about playing the @entity131 way , but to go to @entity13 and play the @entity131 way may not be possible			1
‘ we have a game plan to attack with confidence and belief			0
one of @entity43 ’s main strengths is having a team that is well organised			0
that will never change , but it is the players ’ responsibility to get the transition right ; when to be bold and brave and attack and go for the jugular and when to stick together			2
’ it is 40 days since @entity131 ’s title bid unravelled at @entity146			1
a week earlier , it was @entity1 ’s slip which allowed @entity149 to put @entity150 on course for a victory which would change the destiny of the title			1
‘ what happened against @entity150 was a setback for me , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ but when you play at the top you ’re under pressure every game			0
i am going to make a big mistake from time to time			0
pride : @entity1 says he has gotten over his @entity164 heartbreak with @entity131 weeks ago team spirit : the @entity2 players have prepared well for their game , which will be hot and humid ‘ i have n’t been too hard on myself			1
it drove me mad for a few nights			0
‘ i would rather be in the position to be shot down than be underneath the level of the @entity164 and international football			1
i would much rather be out there and take the responsibility			0
‘ i ’ve moved on			0
i ’m in a great place mentally and physically			0
i feel strong and i believe i can perform			0
my form over the whole season got stronger and stronger			0
certainly when i moved back into the controlling role it ’s been up there with some of the best football i ’ve played			0
’ @entity1 will win his 112th cap against @entity41 and can break @entity184 ’s record of 115 appearances as @entity2 ’s most - capped outfield player — if they make it into the knock - out rounds			1
‘ from an international point of view , this is the pinnacle but i would be very selfish if i was sitting here thinking about my own caps rather than how the team is going to perform , ’ he added			0
‘ i will probably say something in the dressing room			0
it will be a message to say , let ’s not have any regrets			0
let ’s relax and let it happen			0
