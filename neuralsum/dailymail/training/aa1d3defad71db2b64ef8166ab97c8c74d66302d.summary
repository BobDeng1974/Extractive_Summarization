the collapse of the @entity2 's civilisation is often used as a cautionary tale to show the folly of humans who overexploit their surroundings , but scientists have now discovered what allowed the ancient inhabitants to flourish in the first place			1
tiny plant fossils preserved in the dental plaque on teeth found among human remains on the remote @entity16 island have revealed what the doomed civilisation ate - sweet potato			1
scientists found starch grains from the popular tuber embedded in the hardened plaque from a selection of teeth from inhabitants of the island between the 14th and end of the 19th century			2
@entity29 embedded in the dental plaque of ancient human teeth show early inhabitants of @entity2 ate a diet dominated by starch from sweet potato they claim that the starchy , sweet tasting vegetable formed the predominant part of the islander 's diet and was also a major source of water for them			1
they believe the original @entity46 settlers brought the vegetable with them when they first arrived on @entity2 , or @entity2 as it is also known , sometime before the 1200 ad			2
despite living on a remote dot of land in the middle of the @entity16 with only their enigmatic stone figures for company , the ancient @entity46 people who populated @entity2 may not have been as isolated as has long been believed			0
a recent genetic study published in the journal @entity56 found that these ancient people had significant contact with @entity60 populations hundreds of years before @entity62 explorers first reached the island in 1722			2
genetic data on 27 @entity2 natives indicated that interbreeding between the @entity2 and native people in @entity68 occurred roughly between 1300 and 1500			0
the genetic evidence indicates either that @entity2 people traveled to @entity68 or that @entity71 journeyed to @entity2			0
the researchers said it probably was the @entity74 making the arduous ocean round trips			0
' we found evidence of gene flow between this population and @entity60 populations , suggesting an ancient ocean migration route between @entity82 and the @entity83 , ' said geneticist @entity84 of the @entity85 at the @entity86 , who led the study			0
however , the study may also help to explain what led to the ultimate downfall of the civilisation that once flourished on @entity2			1
it is thought that the flourishing @entity2 civilisation , which numbered more than 15,000 at its peak , destroyed the trees that covered the island , leading to wars over dwindling resources			2
grains of silica from the palm trees that were once common over the island were found in the dental plaque of the ancient inhabitants , leading to claims that they had used them for food			1
however , the latest research shows no sign of starch from palm trees on the teeth and that the palm fossils can actually become incorporated into the skin of sweet potatoes grown on the same ground			1
this suggests that as the population grew , the islanders cut down some of the palm forest to create land where they could grow their crops of sweet potatoes			1
@entity126 , an anatomist at the @entity127 in @entity128 who conducted the work , said : ' by about ad 1500 the palm forest that covered most of the island was eradicated			0
' the historic and modern aspect of the landscape is one of low - lying grasses , sedges and invasive shrubs , leaving no visible evidence of the extinct palm thought to have been dominant			0
' the consistency of microfossils recovered from the dental calculus suggest that the plant component of the @entity2 diet probably did not change much through time			2
' this would be expected as cultivation strategies of the sweet potato crops in the marginal @entity2 environment were refined over time			1
' sweet potato does not require processing or cooking before eating , and indeed was probably eaten raw as a source of both carbohydrates and water			1
' @entity2 is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world , more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of @entity160 and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island			0
cultivation of sweet potato may have given the inhabitants on @entity2 time to carve the distinctive stone moai heads that are the only visible signs left on the landscape of the once flourishing civilisation human teeth found at archaeological sites around the coast of @entity2 were studied by the scientists yet it is thought that shortly before 1200 ad , @entity46 sailed to the island and began to settle there , although some experts put the arrival of the first settlers as early as 800 ad			1
the population on the island grew quickly as settlements were formed , thriving for hundreds of years			0
some experts believe the fertile land allowed the population time to develop a rich culture and gave them time to carve the distinctive moai stone heads that the island is now famous for			0
however , the destruction of the palm forests that covered the island led to much of the fertile soil washing away while the introduction of pests like the @entity16 rat also damaged the natural wildlife			2
it was thought that the trees were cut down to provide fuel and building material for the inhabitants			0
but the latest findings , which are published in the @entity201 , suggest that they may have also been removed to make room for agricultural land for growing sweet potato			1
by the time the first @entity207 explorers discovered the island in 1722 , the population had dropped from around 15,000 to between 2,000 and 3,000 and the land was almost barren			1
starvation and war over the remaining resources are thought to have devastated the once stable civilisation and led to some of the famous stone heads being toppled			0
grains of starch from sweet potato were found in the ancient dental plaque of teeth found on @entity2 @entity2 now boasts a population of around 5,000 but by the time the second expedition of @entity207 explorers arrived at the island in 1877 , its population had almost completely died out @entity226 and slave raiding during the 19th century further reduced the population of the island to just over 100 by 1877			1
miss @entity126 and her colleague dr @entity231 from @entity232 , studied 30 human teeth from the remains of 26 individuals found at archaeological sites around the island			0
embedded within the hardened dental plaque , also called dental calculus , were microscopic fossils from plants			0
initial work looking at these found the vast majority were microfossils , or phytoliths , from a species of palm tree ( @entity248 ) that went extinct shortly after the @entity46 's arrival			1
however , further analysis also found starch grains that matched those from modern sweet potatoes			2
the researchers also tested modern sweet potatoes grown in sediment similar to that of @entity2 and found that as the tubers grow , their skins incorporate palm phyotliths from the soil			1
miss @entity126 said that it seemed likely that the sweet potatoes were brought to @entity2 by the first @entity46 settlers			2
she said : ' the sweet potato starch grains were found on almost all of the teeth we looked at and so we think this is evidence that they had the sweet potato with them when the @entity46 settlers colonised the @entity2			1
' we found palm phytoliths in a much larger quantity than the starch grains , which does support that there was once a large quantity of palm trees on @entity2 in the past			2
' @entity283 are usually found in every part of palm trees and so when they die their phytoliths are left behind in the soil indefinitely			0
' this does not necessarily mean that our research supports the conclusion that they were destroyed by humans - although there is other research that does support that conclusion			0
' the scientists found that microfossils from palm trees can become incorporated into the skins of sweet potato , suggesting that the vegetables were grown in soil that had been cleared of palm trees dr @entity231 , an anthropologist at @entity232 who led the work , said that the team were now analysing @entity306 recovered from the dental plaque to see if they can identify animal proteins			1
they have also been able to recover some plant chloroplast dna but have yet to match it to a species			0
he said that the work may lead to new theories about what led to the demise of the civilisation on @entity2			0
he said : ' @entity2 is a profound example of human persistence on a very marginal island , and that through selective use of plants and animals - sweet potatoes and @entity46 rats - that were well - adapted to the rather cold , nontropical environment on @entity2 they arrived at an adequate solution to exist there until the first documented @entity207 arrival on @entity330 , 1722			1
' other island populations in the remote eastern @entity332 - do not persist until @entity207 arrival			0
' it is my opinion that sweet potatoes are not implicated in the demise of the island ’s native palm ; rather , the normal and sustained use of the parts of this tree , coupled with the loss of the germinative seeds or nuts of this tree from the polynesian rat predation is the more likely cause of the trees ’ extinction			1
' forest clearance activities may have had some effect on the sheer number of trees on the island , but i am not convinced that agricultural activities are the prime cause of forest extirpation on @entity2			0

sweet potato was main source of food and water on island scientist find
vegetable dominated the islander 's diet for hundreds of years before @entity207 explorers first arrived on @entity2 in @entity371
@entity374 tree fossils also found in tooth plaque may have come from tree *fragments* embedded in the skins of sweet potatos grown in the same soil
findings suggest that palm tree forests were cut down to make room for agricultural land to grow sweet potatoes , leading to *extensive* soil *erosion*
scientists hope their findings will help explain the mystery of what led to the downfall of the doomed civilisation that lived on @entity2
