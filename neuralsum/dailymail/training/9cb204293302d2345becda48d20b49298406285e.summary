the announcement by @entity1 last week that they would not be releasing the upcoming @entity3 assassination film @entity2 shocked many , especially when government officials confirmed that it was in fact @entity6 who was behind the massive hacking of the movie studio			1
their success was short lived however , as just days later , @entity1 reversed their decision , deciding to put the film in selected theaters across the country while also releasing it on video on demand on christmas day			1
and now , @entity6 and their @entity17 are getting mocked again thanks to a new photo sweeping social media that shows the stoic and stern @entity3 with a full face of make - up and the hashtag @entity24 ‬			1
' this as @entity3 continues to deny that he or his country had anything to do with the massive hack , which saw the release of thousands of private emails between executives at the company , and ultimately culminated with a threat of terrorism aimed at any movie theater set to play the film			1
president @entity57 referred to the hack as an act of ' cybervandalism ' by @entity6 , while @entity6 has stated that they believe the hack was the work of the @entity64 government			2
@entity1 had been widely criticized following their decision last week to shelf the movie , despite the fact that the film cost $ 42million to make and tens of millions to market			2
almost immediately , many in @entity70 voiced their concern , with writer @entity72 saying how upset he was that ' the @entity64 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished , bedrock principle of free speech by a group of @entity6 terrorists , ' and director @entity79 explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward			0
@entity83 also weighed in , saying ; ' we can not be told we ca n't see something by @entity3 , of all f * * * ing people			0
' party guy : the film also depicts @entity3 as a party animal and ladies man @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , who between them operate more than half of the country 's 40,000 cinemas , had announced last wednesday that they would n't be showing the movie			0
