by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have openly admitted their interest in landing @entity4 when his contract expires - and claimed he is mulling over a move			2
the @entity8 winger , who has been on loan at @entity10 since january , is weighing up several offers from clubs across @entity13			1
@entity14 , technical director at @entity2 , claims that while a deal for @entity4 is by no means a forgone conclusion , the club are keen to land him			1
on the hunt ! @entity2 have admitted their interest in signing @entity8 winger @entity4 making waves : @entity4 has been on loan at @entity10 from @entity8 since the january transfer window @entity4 is 22 , meaning that even though he is available on a free transfer , any club wanting to sign him would have to pay the @entity25 some compensation via a tribunal			1
that figure would be in the millions if a @entity30 side agreed a move , but severely reduced if @entity4 were to go abroad , where he may command a fee of just £ 155,000			2
' he 's a young player with an expiring contract who is weighing up several offers , ' @entity14 said on saturday			0
' it 's definitely not a done deal for @entity4			0
it 's an intriguing possibility , him coming here in his father 's footsteps			0
' @entity43 - who managed @entity4 at @entity8 last season - spent two years at the @entity44 in between spells at @entity46 and @entity47			2
@entity48 is weighing up a move for @entity4 , even though he failed to nail down a first team spot at @entity10 in the final months of the season , while @entity52 and @entity53 remain interested			0
@entity4 has been offered a new contract at @entity55 - in a bid by the club to protect their right to compensation - but will not sign it			0
you 're not alone ! @entity2 are one of a number of clubs who are keen on landing @entity4 for a nominal fee			1

@entity4 is out of contract at @entity8 and available for a nominal fee
@entity13 clubs could land winger for as little as £ 155k
@entity73 *international* has been on loan at @entity10
@entity14 *revealed* deal is *n't* ' done ' as @entity4 ponders *future*
