i met with @entity1 last week and the first thing i could see is that he is getting itchy knuckles again			1
this guy wants to fight			2
there are a lot of discussions going on at the moment and as it stands it looks to me like a fight with @entity10 is not going to happen			2
i do n’t think @entity10 wants to fight anyone at the moment , let alone @entity1 , who is not at the age where he wants to be waiting around for challengers to say yes or no. @entity16 is now strong favourite to get the fight , probably in february or march of next year			1
going , going , gone : @entity1 knocked out @entity19 in may and could now fight @entity16 ( below ) winning : @entity16 looked impressive as earned the mandatory challenger shot by beating @entity21 @entity16 is obviously @entity1 ’s mandatory challenger for the @entity24 super-middleweight belt and under those terms @entity1 has to fight him by the end of february or give up the belt			1
@entity1 is not the sort of fighter who just gives up a belt so i think that fight is now very likely			1
i have had some discussions about possible venues and i am looking at a few outdoor stadia , including the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity1 ’s hometown			1
he has filled big arenas from @entity40 to @entity41 to the @entity42 and this is the kind of fight and venue that excites him			1
we are working on it			0
@entity49 also remains an option , be it for this next fight or the one after			2
they just have great fights with each other and at 1 - 1 between the two there is an appetite to justify making it			2
but @entity16 is the strong favourite at the moment			1
he is young , hungry and talented			0
he might make his next appearance on the huge card i am arranging in @entity64 on december 6			1
after that he could get the big one – like i said , i ca n’t see @entity1 vacating a title			1
talks are ongoing over a fight between @entity69 and @entity70			1
it is going well because i think everyone realises it makes sense			0
@entity70 obviously wants a fight with @entity76 , as does everyone in the division , but he knows that while that fight might never happen , even if it did he would make more money fighting @entity69			2
everything so far has been very straightforward and i am in talks with @entity41 over a may date			1
they want us back there as soon as possible after the success of @entity88 – i have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again			0
i hope to have this tied up in the next month or so			2
world champion : @entity69 beat @entity94 to win the @entity24 welterweight title last month connecting : @entity70 could fight @entity69 next may after making his welterweight debut against @entity97 in the spirit of huge domestic fights , the massive rematch between @entity99 and @entity100 looks set to happen on december 6 in @entity64			1
i am planning a big homecoming card for @entity69 ’s first fight after winning his world title and this fight would sit perfectly alongside it			1
you ’ll have noticed a bit more needle than usual between @entity100 and @entity99 on @entity111			1
i spoke to @entity100 last week and he quite rightly would rather have the fight at a neutral venue after winning in @entity114 last time			1
coming for you : @entity100 and @entity99 are almost ready to agree to their rematch i have always said that i would take the fight to the most commercially attractive venue and until recently that was probably going to be @entity114			1
but the option of staging a big card in @entity64 was too good to miss so we will try to go there			1
i will see @entity99 this week to go over the details			2
both fighters obviously would have preferred to fight in their hometown – this provides a sensible solution and an epic night in @entity64			1
all being well , this brilliant fight will be signed off at the end of this week			2
it ’s a big couple of weeks for two of the best super-bantamweight fighters in the world			0
my guy , @entity136 , will defend his @entity138 world title on september 13 in @entity40 against @entity139 , while this weekend @entity140 challenges @entity141 for the @entity24 belt			1
i think both @entity144 fighters will come through these tests and then they simply must have a unification fight			0
forget the politics and whatever rubbish – let ’s just make this fight			2
it is the biggest fight out there for both men			0
on the up : @entity136 ( left ) and @entity140 are destined to meet in the super-bantamweight division i have spoken sporadically to the @entity156 over the past six months			0
when our guys get their next fight out of the way , we need to sit down together , lock ourselves in a room and not come out until it is agreed			0
this is a fight the public must see			0
@entity165 has signed a five - fight deal with @entity167 and i am delighted			2
this guy is one of the best talents in @entity144 boxing			0
he is 23 and already the @entity171 and @entity144 champion , winning all 18 of his fights			0
next up he is against @entity173 for the @entity175 belt on october 4 in @entity176			0
believe me , this guy is one of the best ticket sellers in the business			0
he reminds me of a young @entity180 in that respect			0
when it comes to sales , you tend to have box office sales and sales done by the fighter			0
this guy sells more than 2,000 himself to his fights			0
that ’s an incredible amount			0
the best thing is , he delivers most of them in person ! he ’s a top fighter and a good guy			0
@entity196 attraction : @entity165 is proving himself to be a big talent ... and a big ticket seller			0

i can *reveal* @entity1 is likely to fight @entity16 in a huge all - brit world title fight
i ’m in talks with @entity204 over using the @entity37 in february or march
@entity206 is looking good for @entity41 in may . negotiations should be *wrapped* up within a month
i ’m trying to make @entity100 - @entity99 rematch for december 6 in @entity64
