new laws are to be drawn up to allow driverless cars to take to @entity3 ’s roads			1
ministers admit the current @entity5 and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves			1
with technology being developed on both sides of the @entity13 , the government wants to ensure that @entity3 is not overtaken by @entity15 ’s drive to see its cars used legally on the streets of @entity18			1
@entity15 plans to have prototypes ready to test later this summer and says the goal is for the car to ‘ shoulder the entire burden of driving ’			1
a prize fund of £ 10million will soon be launched in the @entity3 for a whole town or city to develop as a test site for consumer testing of driverless cars			1
science minister @entity46 told @entity47 that he is already in talks with the @entity49 about rewriting the law to allow cars on to @entity3 highways without anyone in the driving seat			1
’ we are one of the world leaders in this , ’ the @entity56 minister declared			0
science minister @entity46 said he wanted to make sure @entity3 is not left behind in the race to get driveless cars on the road a @entity3 version of a driverless is being developed in @entity65 , but @entity15 have so far clocked up more road miles with their version			1
’ there is @entity3 technology , and it 's a lot cheaper than the @entity15 technology , ’ mr @entity46 said			1
’ but whereas the @entity15 car , they have notched up more miles , so we have got to ensure that the @entity3 has its own opportunity to get tested in a wider range of environments and that 's what we are working on with the department for transport			1
’ but the technology is being developed at @entity65 as we speak			2
’ even in the @entity84 self - piloting cars are only allowed on the roads if someone sits in the @entity87 ’			0
the @entity88 is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as september			0
mr @entity46 said : ’ you need a regulatory regime so that these are permitted			2
’ what @entity84 is going to have is a legal regime in @entity18 that permits you to travel in one without requiring someone in the so - called drivers seat			0
’ certainly there are new regulations being drafted in @entity18 and obviously this is something i have discussed with the @entity49 , we are aware of it			2
’ we need to work on these type of regulations so that as the technology develops in @entity65 and elsewhere we can see them used			0
’ the government ’s infrastructure plan commits to reviewing the law to ’ ensure there is a clear and appropriate regime for the testing of driverless cars that supports the world ’s car companies to come hand test them here			2
’ @entity3 will also benefit from recent changes to the @entity119 @entity120 , which dates back to 1968			2
driverless pods are already being used to transport passengers to @entity124 at @entity125 it used to state : ' every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals			0
' an amendment agreed last month would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			0
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			0
the convention covers @entity141 countries , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , although not the @entity84 , @entity146 or @entity147			0
@entity15 says its prototype driverless car has been given a ‘ friendly ’ face to give a non-threatening appearance and help the public accept the new technology			1
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
speed is restricted to 25mph and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity15 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			1
this works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights .			0

technology is being developed in @entity3 to rival @entity15 's driverless car
science minister @entity46 tells @entity47 new laws will be needed
he 's in talks with @entity49 about rewriting rules of the road
@entity15 car will not have a steering wheel , accelerator pedal , or brake pedal
