@entity6 suffered the debilitating illness after *sitting* at her desk
the graduate was in chronic pain spending 80 hours a week at work
the pain was so *bad* , she lost the use of her legs and needed a wheelchair
since launching her mermaid show , @entity6 has *re-learned* how to walk
now she can dive to 20 metres and hold her breath for up to three minutes
