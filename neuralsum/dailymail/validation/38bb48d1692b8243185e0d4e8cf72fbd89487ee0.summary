@entity0 today puts the prospect of @entity3 ‘ calling the tune ’ in a deal with @entity5 at the centre of the @entity8 election campaign			1
as he launches a poster showing a tiny @entity11 in mr @entity3 ’s pocket , the prime minister warns of the ‘ chilling and real prospect ’ of @entity5 being propped up in government by the @entity15			1
his offensive comes after a day in which four members of @entity5 ’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the @entity15 in the event of a hung parliament			1
this would sink any prospect of mr @entity11 winning a @entity38 majority			0
mr @entity0 says today : ‘ @entity39 needs to wake up to a chilling and real prospect – @entity11 as prime minister , propped up by @entity3 who says he ’ll call the tune			1
‘ again and again , @entity11 refuses to rule out this possibility			0
he is so weak , everyone knows he would be in @entity3 ’s pocket			2
on every vote , every budget , every decision , the @entity15 would exact a high price for his support			2
‘ everyone in @entity39 will pay with higher taxes , more spending , more debt and weaker defences in dangerous times			0
to keep the recovery on track and avoid this nightmare , vote @entity26			0
’ the prime minister 's offensive comes after a day in which four members of @entity5 ’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the @entity15 in the event of a hung parliament a @entity5 parliamentary candidate has rejected a £ 1,000 donation from @entity69 towards her election campaign			1
@entity71 , who is standing in @entity72 , said on @entity73 her ‘ instinct ’ was to turn the offer down			2
the former prime minister has pledged £ 106,000 to help @entity5 campaigns in 106 marginal seats			1
but there has been unease about mr @entity69 ’s links to foreign corporations and dictatorships and candidates have been under pressure to hand back the so - called ‘ blood money ’			2
mr @entity11 is under huge pressure from his @entity89 mps to rule out a deal with the nationalists			0
yesterday his deputy @entity92 dodged the issue eight times on the @entity95 show on @entity96			0
@entity5 energy spokesman @entity97 refused four times to rule out a deal with the nationalists on the @entity101 on @entity102			1
she said : ‘ we are focused on winning a @entity5 majority government			2
we do not want , we do not need and we do not plan to have any coalition with the @entity15			2
’ shadow justice secretary @entity107 dodged the question four times on @entity110 on @entity111 and shadow @entity89 secretary @entity112 did so nine times on the @entity102 ’s @entity114			0
on friday , mr @entity3 , the former @entity15 leader who is expected to lead the party in @entity30 after the election , said @entity89 could ‘ call the tune ’ in the @entity38			1
‘ it is now clear that neither @entity8 nor @entity5 will win an overall majority , ’ he said			1
‘ neither are fit to govern			0
‘ it is also clear that @entity89 is swinging behind @entity15 candidates the length and breadth of the country			2
in that situation @entity89 can call the tune in the next @entity128			0
’ at the same time , @entity89 first minister @entity129 removed the biggest obstacle to a @entity5 - @entity15 deal by ditching her red line on @entity133			1
she said her party could back a minority labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent			0
@entity139 say the party has ‘ decided internally ’ not to rule out an @entity15 pact before the election			1
this will be particularly concerning to @entity145 voters who fear the price of concessions the @entity15 will seek to extract from @entity5 in return for handing mr @entity11 the keys to no 10			1
peeping from the breast pocket of a giant @entity3 , @entity11 is portrayed as a mere plaything of the @entity15 in the @entity8 ’ latest poster			1
lips pursed , he appears pensive and childlike as the larger - than - life @entity89 nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk			0
the poster ’s clear aim is to suggest mr @entity3 will have free rein to boss mr @entity11 around if their parties form a coalition in may			1
last night the pair were immediately dubbed ‘ @entity164 and @entity165 ’			2
the @entity8 campaign drew comparisons to @entity169 ’s @entity168 , which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s			0
its targets included @entity172 and @entity173 , joint leaders of the @entity175			0
mr @entity173 was lampooned as mr @entity172 ’s adoring sidekick and sometimes appeared in his pocket , left			0
