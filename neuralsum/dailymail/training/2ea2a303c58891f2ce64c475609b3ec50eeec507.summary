in @entity2 , a 78 - year - old woman strolling in her neighborhood was punched in the head by a stranger and tumbled to the ground			1
in @entity7 , a 46 - year - old man died after someone sucker - punched him and he struck his head on an iron fence			2
most recently , a @entity12 representative was hit over the head while walking home from dinner in @entity16 in each case , police are investigating whether the attacks are part of a violent game called ' knockout , ' where the object is to target unsuspecting pedestrians with the intention of knocking them out cold with one punch			1
authorities and psychologists say the concept has been around for decades - or longer - and it 's played mostly by impulsive teenage boys looking to impress their friends			2
' it 's hard to excuse this behavior , there 's no purpose to this , ' said @entity37 , a psychologist specializing in juvenile delinquency at the @entity39			2
' when someone runs into a store and demands money , you can sort of understand why they 're doing it , desperation , whatever			2
but just hitting someone for the sheer thrill of seeing if you can knock someone out is just childish			2
above , a @entity61 video showing one such attack attacked : someone comes up behind the victim before striking and then running at least two deaths have been linked to the game this year and police have seen a recent spike in similar attacks			1
@entity2 police have deployed additional officers to city neighborhoods where at least seven attacks occurred in the past few weeks , including the assault on the 78 - year - old woman			1
police commissioner @entity77 said some are smacked , some are more seriously assaulted , and some harassed			1
the department 's hate crimes task force is investigating , because some attacks have been against @entity83 in @entity84			1
in @entity16 , police were investigating two assaults in the past week , both of which resulted in minor injuries but not unconsciousness			1
one victim , @entity91 , of @entity92 , @entity93 , said she was randomly punched in the face by a teenager while riding her bike during a work - related visit to @entity16 last friday			2
@entity91 , who is 32 and works with teenagers in her job , said the blow knocked her head to the side and bloodied her nose			1
@entity104 : @entity91 was struck while riding her bike in @entity16 last friday @entity12 democratic representative @entity105 is another possible victim of the game in @entity16			1
she was walking home from dinner in the district when someone punched her and stole her @entity112 purse ' i do n't know what the goal was , ' she said			2
' there was n't any attempt to take anything from me			2
' while some of those attacked have been white , and some suspected attackers black , experts said the incidents are more about preying on the seemingly helpless than race or religion			2
' it 's about someone who is seemingly helpless , and choosing that person to target , ' @entity37 said			2
@entity12 democratic representative @entity105 is another possible victim of the game in @entity16			1
she was walking home from dinner in the district when someone punched her and stole her @entity112 purse			0
' she does n't know for sure , but you ca n't rule it out , ' @entity134 spokesman @entity133 told @entity137 about the knockout possibility			1
a recent media blitz about the game circulating on television stations and online is n't helping , @entity91 and experts said , especially because images are being repeatedly broadcast of victims in a dead fall , smacking the ground with a limp thud			1
the viral footage comes from older incidents : in one instance from 2012 , 50 - year - old @entity153 @entity152 teacher @entity151 was punched in the face and falls to the curb			0
the image was caught on surveillance cameras , and a 15 - year - old was arrested			0
struck : @entity161 teacher @entity160 was attacked by a group of teens near the school where he taught in october 2012 out cold : the @entity152 teacher ( left ) dropped to the ground and bashed his head on a curb			0
he fell so quickly , he did n't even attempt to catch himself with his hands ' the behavior of the sudden assault of someone who seems helpless has appealed to the idiotic impulsive quality of adolescence forever , ' said @entity37			0
' but there are now bragging rights beyond your immediate circle , when this is on television and online			0
' @entity182 , a psychology professor at @entity183 who studies aggressive behavior , said thursday the media stories may perpetuate the assaults , but most teens clearly are n't unfeeling sociopaths			0
' you 've got some impressionable kids , already with a propensity for violence who could be affected by this , ' he said			0
' but not because they are hoping to hurt somebody , it 's more about risk taking , and new , different and exciting ways of getting into trouble			0
' in @entity202 , a leafy suburb near @entity203 , two attacks may be related to the game			1
arrested : nineteen - year - olds @entity206 ( left ) and @entity207 ( right ) were charged last october for knocking down a 63 - year - old man who was out walking his dog in @entity202 , @entity210 @entity212 attack : last may , @entity213 was killed after being knocked out with a single punch leaving a grocery store in @entity216 , @entity2			1
the group that punched him went on to stomp and beat him to death ' we do worry that it 's something like that ... because we 've had two similar assaults , neither one of which resulted in a robbery , ' said lt. @entity226 of the @entity227			0
in one , two 19 - year - olds were charged with knocking down a 63 - year - old man out walking his dog the evening of oct. 29			0
they were arrested nearby a short time later , and have been charged with assault , @entity226 said			0

he was found sept. 10 with his neck broken and his head wedged between iron fence posts			0
@entity243 spokesman @entity242 has said prosecutors believe the teens were playing the game			1
in late may in @entity216 , a group of teenagers attempting to knock @entity213 out with a single punch wound up beating and stomping him to death , according to police			1
a 16 - year - old was found guilty of manslaughter , and his 13 - year - old co-defendant pleaded guilty to assault , admitting he started the fatal beating by trying to knock out @entity213 with a single punch			1
both were sentenced to 18 months behind bars			0
and earlier in may , @entity261 , now 20 , was sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years in @entity264 for killing a @entity266 immigrant as part the game in 2011			1
gruesome : @entity269 was discovered murder this past september with his neck broken and his head wedged between iron fence posts caught on camera : prosecutors believe three teens were involved in @entity238 's death and were spotted on @entity278 getting on the train juvenile delinquency experts say a good punishment for these teens would be empathy training , such as volunteering at a homeless shelter			0
but a @entity2 lawmaker proposed a bill this week that would make stricter sentences not only for those who do the punching , but for those who publish images online and watch the attacks			1
' these twisted and cowardly thugs are preying on innocent bystanders and they do n't care if the victims are young , old , a man or woman , ' @entity294 state assemblyman @entity293 said			0
' life is n't a video game			1
these are real people whose lives are not only being put in jeopardy but in many cases destroyed			0
' horrific : @entity261 , 18 , left , was charged with first degree murder after retired teacher @entity307 , right , was beaten to death as his wife watched in @entity310			0

police across the @entity53 have noticed a recent spike in violent attacks connected to the came ' knockout '
the point of the game is to take a stranger by *surprise* and punch them
groups of teenagers seem to be the main perpetrators of the random game
the game has caused at least two deaths
