by @entity0 scientists at @entity2 have made a breakthrough in a study of the heart defect which almost killed footballer @entity6 scientists have discovered the cause of a heart defect which almost killed footballer @entity6			1
the breakthrough in understanding @entity12 cardiomyopathy could now pave the way for new drugs and a cure			1
the heart condition kills dozens of young people every year , because until now experts have been unable to pinpoint the cure			1
but heart specialists at @entity2 found two vital proteins in heart cells are to blame for the previously inexplicable cause of death			1
a rare genetic mutation in some people causes the two proteins to ' not communicate ' with each other			1
professor @entity29 , from @entity30 , said : ' a healthy and regular heartbeat is maintained by precise control of the calcium level in heart muscle cells			0
' but our experiments have identified a genetic flaw that invites chaos to this process			0
' his colleague dr @entity40 explained why the heart ’s biological equilibrium becomes unstable			0
he said : ' when calcium levels rise the heart contracts - and when the calcium levels drop the heart muscle relaxes , similar to the upstroke and downstroke of a motor engine			1
' the precise control of this movement relies on the direct physical interaction between a calcium channel protein ryanodine receptor and a calcium - sensing protein called calmodulin			2
' we discovered that a genetic mutation in calmodulin causes a loss of regular heart rhythm and produces ineffective communication between the two proteins			2
he added : ' abnormal changes in calcium levels disrupt the smooth cycling between cardiac contraction and relaxation that leads to irregular heartbeat and sudden death			0
' the @entity73 scientists say drugs could be developed to give doctors a new weapon in the fight against sudden cardiac death			2
@entity80 ’s brother , @entity79 , was 15 when he suddenly collapsed and died during a kick around with his father , former @entity83 and @entity85 manager @entity84 , at the family home in @entity87 in 1992			1
@entity89 presenter @entity88 later launched the @entity79 appeal in his memory			2
@entity6 was playing for @entity91 in an @entity93 tie against @entity94 in march 2012 when his heart stopped for 78 minutes			1
after his recovery he supported campaigns to prevent deaths from sudden cardiac arrests			0
professor @entity100 , associate medical director at the @entity101 , said : ' keeping the heart ’s calcium levels under control is critical to maintaining a healthy rhythm			0
the former @entity108 's star 's heart stopped beating for 78 minutes after he collapsed suffering hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the @entity93 quarter final against @entity94 in march 2012 presenter @entity80 , left , lost her brother @entity79 to the condition when he was just 15 years old , in 1992			1
he was playing football with his father ex-footballer and @entity83 international @entity84 when he collapsed ' by showing how calmodulin mutation could disrupt this and lead to sudden cardiac death , the @entity73 team have provided new clues for how to treat the condition in the future			2
' uncovering genetic links like this is vital to help combat the devastating effects of inherited heart conditions			0
' we are urgently campaigning for more research to help find the undiscovered faulty genes putting people at greater risk of heart disease			2
' dr @entity132 , deputy chief executive of @entity133 ( @entity133 ) , said : ' young sudden cardiac death is caused by many different conditions , not all of which are genetic			0
' however , significant progress is being made in genetics and we hope this research will result in practices that can reduce the incidence of young sudden cardiac death			0
' in 80 per cent of young sudden deaths there are no prior symptoms , which is why @entity133 campaigns for all young people to have the opportunity to be tested			0
' our screening programme currently tests around 15,000 young people every year - and one in every 300 people we test has a potentially life threatening condition identified			1
' we will continue to lobby for greater access to free screening , especially for young people regularly involved in sport , even at a grass roots level			0
