by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 17:44 est , 23 january 2014 hundreds of thousands of offences may not have been documented because police fiddled the figures			0
constabularies in @entity6 and @entity7 yesterday reported that the number of crimes fell by 3 per cent last year			1
but in the @entity11 force – where figures have been ‘ cleaned up ’ after a period of manipulation – recorded crime rose by 8 per cent			2
picture of @entity16 : crime has dropped to the lowest level since 1981 but there are mounting concerns that police have been ' fiddling ' figures for years on the rise : one area where crimes appear to be rising is sexual offences , with experts saying the @entity28 scandal and the ' @entity29 ' has caused a surge in reports if the same pattern was repeated across the country nearly 300,000 extra crimes would be reported			1
in @entity11 , violent crime was up a fifth and sex offences and robbery by half			1
drug offences were up by 14 per cent , public order offences by 16 per cent and other ‘ miscellaneous ’ crimes by a third			0
it is thought much of the increase is related to the more rigorous recording techniques			0
the figures suggest crime figures will rise in other areas with thorough checking			1
last week , the @entity49 stripped police crime figures of their stamp of approval			1
the watchdog told @entity55 there had been no proper audit for five years			0
accusation : shadow policing minister @entity58 says the public are losing faith and confidence in crime stats however ministers , who have trumpeted sharp falls in crime in recent years , pointed to falls in the @entity67 of @entity6 and @entity7 , which is based on interviews with 40,000 members of the public			1
it shows crime falling by 10 per cent year on year to its lowest level since records began in 1981			2
the survey is traditionally seen as a more reliable barometer of crime levels over time			2
it showed sharp falls in violence – by 13 per cent – and snatch thefts			2
crimes against households fell 10 per cent and bike theft was down 15 per cent , to its lowest level in a decade			0
@entity86 , @entity87 crime prevention minister , said : ‘ @entity6 and @entity7 are safer than they have been for decades with crime now at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981			1
‘ the government has made clear that recorded crime statistics must be as robust as possible and we have a strong record on reinforcing their independence and accountability			0
’ despite an overall fall in recorded crime , police figures showed a 4 per cent increase in shoplifting and a 7 per cent increase in pickpocketing and snatch thefts			1
reports of fraud – including card theft , online fraud and email scams – rocketed 34 per cent , to 200,000			0
this is thought to be due in part to improved recording techniques			0
recent rises in sex offences continued			0
they were up by 17 per cent , including a sharp increase in sex attacks on under - 13s			1
these increases have been linked to the so - called ‘ @entity28 effect ’ as historic victims are encouraged to come forward			2
@entity123 , a whistleblower and @entity125 constable , told @entity55 last year that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had become ‘ an engrained part of policing culture ’			1
ministers have ordered a full review of figures across the country , to be carried out by the police watchdog			0
in june last year , following an official review , @entity11 chief constable @entity135 admitted there had been a ‘ distortion of activity ’ by officers trying to meet crime targets			0
this week a senior analyst at the @entity143 suggested some officers were recording offences only if they thought there was enough evidence to lay a charge			0
the @entity49 has withdrawn its stamp of approval on police crime figures			1

crime survey for @entity6 and @entity7 reveals *8m* ' *incidents* ' in past year
falls in household crime , thefts and violent crime drives drop , experts say
effect of @entity28 and @entity165 causes rise in sex attacks
last week @entity49 withdrew approval of @entity16 crime figures
*critics* say *500,000* crimes , including sex attacks , ' *screened* out ' in 2013
