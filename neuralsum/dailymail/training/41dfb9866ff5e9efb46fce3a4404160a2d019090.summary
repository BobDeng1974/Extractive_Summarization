but for now , black bears across the western @entity4 have taken to scavenging for food to fatten up before the winter , and for many across @entity9 , it has become a record problem - and is getting worse			1
in august alone , police in @entity12 received nearly 300 calls to report the lumbering creatures , up a staggering 668 per cent from last year			1
@entity29 bear specialist @entity28 told the @entity26 that the influx in bears is in part due to this year ’s severe drought conditions			1
he said that bears have been forced into urban and suburban areas this year because food supplies are short elsewhere			1
a dumpster or trash can becomes a meal for the creatures			2
@entity42 ’s @entity41 noted similar conditions			0
she reported : ‘ the drought has dried up many of the chokecherry and acorn crops that normally grow abundantly , so the bears must search for their dinner			1
’ another problem is that the human population has bled into the bear ’s natural habitat , meaning they must search greater distances for food sources			0
@entity57 predicted today that the bear epidemic out @entity59 will worsen as the summer ends and fall commences , as bears must consume highly - caloric meals in preparation for winter			1
branching out : a family of black bears was spotted hanging out in a tree near @entity67 dry season : there has been severe drought in much of the country this summer , meaning that the bears ' food supplies are dwindling ‘ they ’re looking at trying to consume 20,000 calories a day , ’ @entity74 and @entity76 ’s @entity75 told @entity57			1
last week , a @entity80 rancher shot and killed a black bear that scaled a tall fence and broke into his house to rummage for food this week along the @entity85			1
@entity86 discovered damage when he returned to his home near @entity89 on monday evening			0

' it was dark out			0
i was headed for the light switch when it ran across ahead of me , ' @entity86 told the @entity102			0
' that 's when i knew i had an issue			1
' damage control : police in @entity12 received nearly 300 calls reporting bears in august alone ; here , a black bear left quite a mess @entity112 , grizzly bear management specialist with the @entity114 , said the bear had probably been in the house for an hour			1
@entity86 dispatched it with a rifle			0
' i killed it so someone else would n't have to , ' @entity86 said			0
' we 're fat with grizzlies , but the black bear was off the beaten path			1
' indeed , bears will go to any lengths necessary to get the calories they ’re craving			1
in @entity9 last week , a hungry black bear broke into a @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity9 to find his favourite treats			2
mr @entity28 said that the black bear epidemic can be lessened slightly by safe practices			2
for one , waste should be placed in bear - proof containers			0
those who do n’t comply with city mandates will be subject to heavy fining			0
bears that are recovered from populated areas have a two - strike policy , @entity142 spokesperson @entity141 said			2
after the first offence , the bear is tagged and relocated			0
after the second strike , they are euthanized			0
already , at least 28 bears have been put down			2
