by @entity0 a man hacked off his own leg using only a metal saw , a small fruit knife and a back scratcher wrapped with a towel because he could n't afford hospital bills			2
according to @entity9 , @entity10 , 47 , from @entity12 city , @entity8 , began to experience bouts of pain in his abdomen that traveled to both of his legs			1
he was diagnosed with massive arterial thrombosis in both legs			1
as the pain worsened , he decided to take the gruesome step of removing the infected limb himself to avoid the expensive hospital bill			2
excruciating : mr @entity10 took the desperate step of removing his own infected right leg			1
he had been diagnosed with massive thrombosis and was in severe pain angiograms taken before the home amputation showed that all of the arteries in his right leg were completely gone			1
doctors told the mr @entity10 , known in his town as being a ' tough guy ' , the disease was very rarely seen , and he was n't likely to live more than a month			1
for three months , mr @entity10 was tormented by pain to the point of fuzzy consciousness , screaming so loud that his neighbors could not sleep			1
' it was very painful and they gave me medication but it did n't help			2
' the farmer went to several hospitals in @entity49 and @entity50 but every time he was simply sent home with more medication to his farm in @entity56 's @entity55 village			0
he said : ' sometimes the pain was so intense i would pass out , then after three months when it was really bad , they told me that an infection had set in , that i had gangrene , and that i might lose the limb			2
' ideally i needed it to be operated on , but i could not afford it			0
they just gave me medication			0
they sent me home to die			0
' one night , after his wife had gone to bed , mr @entity10 found a fruit knife , a metal saw and a towel - wrapped back scratcher and began amputating his own leg			1
@entity10 used the saw and the knife to cut away at the flesh while biting down on a back scratcher to help him withstand the pain as the pain in @entity10 's leg increased , he grabbed the saw and fruit knife and performed the amputation himself @entity10 points to the wrapped up remains of his leg that he disposed of with the rest of his rubbish he said : ' i had a wooden back scratcher , i wrapped a towel around it , and bit on it so i did not scream and wake my wife , then i used the knife to slice the skin and pull it back so i could see the bone			1
then i used the saw to slice through the bone after putting a belt around the leg to stop the blood flow			0
' i did not want to distress my wife , but i had to wake her when the hacksaw blade broke			0
' more than 20 minutes later , his wife awoke and found him with his right leg amputated			0
her husband ’s right leg had been sawed off about 15 centimeters from the hip , and the metal saw used for the amputation had snapped into two from the excessive force , and on the table were 4 molars that had been bitten off			0
fortunately , because of the thrombosis , there was n’t much blood during the amputation			2
painful : mr @entity119 's leg was severed about 15centimetres from his hip wheelchair - bound : farmer mr @entity10 is uable to work since the loss of his limb			1

doctors say he will not be able to save his remaining foot - and he needs an operation if he is not to lose the entire left leg			0
as @entity10 's condition worsens , @entity10 's wife , who suffers from diabetes and heart disease , is forced to tend to the farm on her own			2
the family 's only financial support comes from their 17 - year - old daughter , who dropped out of school to take a job			0
