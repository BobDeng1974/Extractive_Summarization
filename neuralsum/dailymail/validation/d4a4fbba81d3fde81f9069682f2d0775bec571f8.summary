this family of wedding crashers risked the wrath of the bride to capture these photos			1
@entity5 and @entity6 , and their two children , take to the beach in tropical @entity10 to snap photobombing shots with unsuspecting wedding parties who have forked out thousands on the dream ceremonies			1
the family - of - four , originally from @entity16 in @entity17 , lived on the idyllic island for five years and decided to take their quirky photos at the @entity22 beach lagoon			1
@entity5 and @entity6 pose with their arms in a heart shape as a couple marries in @entity10 smitten couples loved the beauty spot so much that they flocked there almost hourly , giving the family the idea that they could make their way into wedding albums back in 2004			1
pediatric occupational therapist @entity5 , 36 , said : ' it was so frequent it was comical			0
' i remember a specific conversation one day , when my husband and i wondered , " how many random people 's wedding photos are we in the background in our bathing suits ? "			1
' from there , it was a dare to go get in that wedding photo			2
' in this picture @entity5 is seen pulling a funny face , however , she says they stopped directly photobombing wedding parties after some people complained @entity5 and @entity6 pose on the beach as a happy couple have their wedding snaps taken behind them @entity5 and @entity6 , 38 , as well as kids @entity57 , eight and @entity59 , six , have since turned the hobby into a family tradition			2
but they have been met with some resistance from happy couples and guests			2
@entity5 said : ' we quickly realised actually photobombing was n't cool			0
' the wedding co-ordinators would shoo us away or we would get scowls from the bridal party			2
' it 's not our style to be rude			1
so , we started taking pics of ourselves with the wedding in the background			0
it was way less invasive and still fun			0
' in this picture a friend has taken a picture of @entity5 and @entity6 larking about in the background of this happy couple 's wedding day @entity5 says she and the family try to think up funny poses for their pictures , here they are hiding behind a tree the family ditched their desperate clambering to get in the background of the pictures to take centre stage			1
they have since posed behind trees , made love hearts out of hands and even danced while in full view of wedding parties			0
@entity5 said : ' it was a game we played only on vacation but now we include our kids in the fun and whoever else wants to play			0
' this year , we are vacationing in @entity10 with my parents and we have enlisted my mum and dad as official beach wedding photo bomb paparazzi			1
' we all start cheering and hi - fiving when we see a white gown and an entourage of bridesmaids on the beach			0
it is fun to figure out the silliest pose or best angle for our picture			0
' @entity5 waves while in the background a couple stand on the beach having their wedding photographs taken sometimes the couple will even get their children involved , this time carrying them across the grass			0
