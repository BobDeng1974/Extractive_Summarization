@entity0 knew the moment he had to make his move			1
sitting in the stands of the @entity5 , his eye was drawn to the scurrying @entity6 who was pestering @entity8			1
this was the biggest game of @entity12 ’s life : @entity13 v @entity14			1
it was @entity13 ’s first @entity17 game watched by a capacity crowd inside one of football ’s cathedrals			1
but , for 45 minutes , the combative midfielder bothered the greatest player in the world to distraction			2
@entity12 has played in all of @entity27 's games so far this season @entity12 produced a sterling display against @entity14 superstar @entity8 at the @entity29 ‘ he marked @entity8 out of the game in the first half , ’ @entity0 recalled , as he explained why he had to sign @entity12 for £ 4million from @entity30 last summer			1
‘ i first became aware of him as a young boy at @entity36			0
he ’s a young man with incredible potential			2
’ @entity8 , ultimately , won the battle , scoring a magnificent goal in a 2 - 1 win but @entity0 knew he had to bring @entity12 to @entity41			1
without that performance , the 22 - year - old would have been getting ready for a @entity45 clash with @entity46 on tuesday			1
the @entity48 forward was completely marked out of the game in the first half by the impressive @entity51 @entity12 , seen in action against @entity53 last saturday , has started the @entity27 ' last three @entity55 games ‘ it was a big step up for me , ’ @entity12 explains			1
‘ if i had n’t gone , maybe i would n’t be playing here			0
i ’d be in @entity57 with @entity58			0
but after the @entity17 @entity27 came in and clubs from @entity61 and @entity62 as well			1
’ it changed his life but it did n’t change him			0
sat in the media room of @entity27 ’s @entity69 training base , with a woolly hat pulled tightly down on his head , it quickly becomes apparent it takes a lot to ruffle @entity12 ; not even a mistake on his debut against @entity75 that led to a goal bothered him unduly			1
he is economical with his words but that does not mean he is n’t an engaging interviewee and the story about going toe - to - toe with @entity8 gives an insight into his character			1
‘ it was good , ’ he says with a smile			0
‘ did i swap shirts ? no. no. i always keep my shirts as playing for @entity13 means so much			1
i do n’t have idols			0
' i liked @entity90 when i was younger for how they played			2
i ’ve never supported a player or a team			0
i know it sounds strange but that ’s how it is			0
’ @entity12 looks to hold off the challenge of @entity99 midfielder @entity98 in the @entity100 @entity12 has been up against some top opposition this season , none more so than @entity104 that is why he wo n’t be losing any sleep over this afternoon ’s trip to @entity108			1
@entity12 will be in the heart of @entity27 ’s midfield , charged with stopping @entity112 ’s rampaging runs — but he will not be flinching from any challenges			1
‘ i do like to tackle , ’ he says , with a glint in his eye			0
‘ but i am a little bit skinny so i need a bit more weight on me but i will make progress with that in time			0
' i am in the gym a lot , every day doing a little bit			0
i go at 100 per cent with every tackle			0
if a yellow card comes then i go slower			0
’ born in @entity127 , @entity12 began his career at @entity36 but ended up moving to @entity129 after a fall - out with manager @entity131			1
one story claimed that @entity131 pinned @entity12 against the wall by the throat during a disagreement but he quickly dispels that story			1
he also firmly explains why there was not the slightest hint of regret when he saw the country where he was born winning the @entity17 this summer			2
the @entity142 fa made attempts to get him into their system but @entity12 would not be swayed			1
‘ i have no regrets at all , ’ says @entity12			1
‘ i had an approach to play for the @entity147			0
maybe it would have been better for my career at that time to choose @entity142 but my heart always said @entity13			1
it was just inside my heart , i could never say what			0
@entity12 has also established himself as a regular starter for his country , @entity13 ‘ my parents never tried to influence me or said “ you have to play for @entity13 ”			1
they just let me make my decision			0
all the @entity13 players are like this			2
' the people have a strong mentality			0
i ca n’t explain why but back in @entity13 i feel better			2
’ he will be back among friends at the @entity165 as @entity166 is there to welcome him			0
they do not have plans to share dinner after the game but it is clear that @entity166 has helped @entity51 and his girlfriend , @entity173 , settle into life in @entity175			2
‘ @entity166 said i would have to be patient when i arrived because the league is so different , ’ @entity12 explains			2
‘ he said it ’s the best league in the world			0
@entity0 then told me about @entity27 and how the fans were so passionate			1
he explained about the club ’s history			0
‘ so far i have shown about 50 per cent of what they will see			0
i need a bit more time but i hope in another half year , when i am really settled , my quality will come out			2
my ambitions ? my ambition is to win every game i play			2
whether it is @entity108 or whoever — i want to win			0
’ and @entity8 , for one , can verify that combative streak .			2

@entity12 has appeared in every @entity27 game this season
the *highly* - rated @entity13 *international* *joined* for £ 4million last summer
the 22 - year - old knows his man - marking display on @entity8 played a huge role in his move to @entity27
and @entity0 was so impressed that he ensured he quickly tied up a deal
