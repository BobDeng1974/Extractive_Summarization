by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 19 february 2013 for most expectant mothers , an 8lb baby is more than enough to deal with			0
so spare a thought for @entity4 , who carried two of them			0
her daughter and son , @entity9 and @entity10 , had a combined weight of 17lb 8oz , almost double the average for twins			1
@entity14 : @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right , are the new siblings of @entity16 , nine and five - year - old @entity17 double troube : @entity18 with her healthy babies , @entity9 and @entity10 , whose combined weight at birth was 18lbs @entity9 weighed 8lb 13oz and @entity22 11oz when they were born by caesarean section on january 11			1
it means they are among the largest pairs of mixed - sex twins ever born in the @entity29			1
mrs @entity4 had watched her waist grow to 57 inches during her pregnancy so she knew her babies would be big – just not that big			0
but for the 38 - year - old , all that matters is that the twins are healthy			1
she and her husband , @entity10 , had endured three miscarriages in the past , including the loss of another set of twins			1
she suffers from a rare blood - clotting disorder called @entity44 syndrome or ‘ sticky blood , ’ which is one of the biggest causes of recurrent miscarriage			0
clots form in the placenta , causing the pregnancy to fail			0
sibling love : @entity4 , 38 , had an inkling the twins she was expecting might be bigger than normal when her bump measured a whopping 57 inches when mrs @entity4 became pregnant for the first time she was expecting twins , but that pregnancy ended in a heartbreaking miscarriage			2
she was still oblivious to the blood problem when she later gave birth to 6lb 12oz @entity16 , who is now nine			1
she said : ‘ when he was delivered the placenta was full of clots and it was a miracle he survived			0
’ mrs @entity4 and her husband , a 41 - year - old electronics engineer , tried for more children and two more miscarriages followed			0
she was not given any tests in the @entity29 , but when the family spent a period living in @entity72 she told a local doctor about her history and @entity44 syndrome was ‘ diagnosed straight away ’			2
the miscarriage risk is easily treated with blood - thinning drugs and as a result @entity17 was born , weighing 9lb 3oz			1
the world 's heaviest pair of twins weighed a total of 27lbs 12oz and were born to @entity83 on 20 february 1924 in @entity84 , @entity86 - @entity85 weighed 14lbs and @entity87 weighed 13lbs 2oz			1
@entity85 is the heaviest twin ever born			2
the world 's lightest surviving twins , weighing a total of 1lb 8.5oz , were @entity91 ( 12oz ) and @entity92 , born in @entity93 , @entity86 , on 1 march 2000 the twins born furthest apart were @entity95 and @entity96 , born 95 days apart on 15 october 1993 and 18 january 199 , in @entity93 , @entity86 mixed set : @entity4 's two older children said they were hoping for a brother and a sister , so they were happy with @entity9 and @entity10 after slimming down to 15 stone from 21 stone , mrs @entity4 then decided to try for a third baby			1
she said : ‘ we ended up with two instead of one			0
it was a shock but a nice surprise			0
’ she found out she was expecting twins at a seven - week scan , and was again given medication to prevent her blood clotting			2
the pregnancy went without a hitch and the twins were born at 37 weeks			2
‘ when i saw them for the first time they were big but normal babies			0
i did n’t realise they were anything unusual , ’ she said			0
the average twin is around 5lb so staff at @entity120 were stunned when they weighed @entity9 and @entity10			1
the @entity29 record for mixed - sex twins is a combined 18lb 12oz and mrs @entity4 believes she would have broken it had she gone to full term			1
‘ i knew they were going to be big but did n’t expect this , ’ she said			0
‘ my health visitor said in 20 years she has never known such big twins			0
’ the babies , now five weeks old , are flourishing at home in @entity132 , @entity133 under the careful eye of their parents and older siblings			2
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ @entity17 and @entity16 wanted one of each so they were delighted when they found out			1
’ @entity4 said : ' they are getting on very well and are good babies			0
they already look so different and have different personalities ' achoo ! according to @entity4 , @entity10 , right , is very chilled out while @entity9 , left , is a bit more fussy			1

@entity18 , 38 , from @entity133 , gave birth to @entity9 and @entity10
the average weight of a twin is usually just 5lb
mother - of - four already has @entity16 , nine , and @entity17 , five
heaviest ever mixed - set twins born in @entity29 in 2007 , weighing 18lbs 12oz
