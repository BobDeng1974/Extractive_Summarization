@entity2 , the brain dead 13 - year - old at the center of a battle to turn off her life support machine , may not ' make it through the day ' after hospital treatment left her weaker than first thought , her lawyer told @entity12			1
@entity13 said @entity2 , pronounced brain dead after a tonsil operation , had ' deteriorated ' more than expected because her body had been ' starved ' while on a ventilator at @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity20			1
@entity2 was released from the hospital into the care of her family last night after a bitter and high profile battle with doctors treating her			1
but he said it was touch and go whether she ' would make it '			0
' @entity2 is in worse shape than we thought , ' @entity13 said			2
' the hospital ’s withdrawal of nutrients has caused her to deteriorate more rapidly than we thought			2

' because of the amount of damage to her throat she is not doing very well , ' he said			0
' @entity2 is in very bad shape			2
right now we do n’t know if she is going to make it			0
the doctors are doing everything they can to help her make it through the day			0
' his comments came after the family finally moved @entity2 from the hospital where she has been on a ventilator since suffering complications on december 9			1
the hospital had wanted to turn off the ventilator after she had been pronounced brain dead by three doctors and the local coroner had issued a death certificate			1
devastated : @entity2 's parents fought to keep their 13 - year - old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery last december but the family , led by her mother @entity77 and uncle @entity78 , refused to accept there was no hope and agreed to take ' full responsibility ' for @entity2 if the hospital released her			1
they claimed that with the right care she could make a recovery			0
but the hospital insisted the girl could not be be rehabilitated			0
spokesman @entity87 yesterday criticized the family 's decision to give @entity2 ' nutrients ' to maintain her brain at optimum efficiency			1
' this is a deceased young woman , ' @entity18 spokesman @entity87 told @entity95 7			0
' no amount of food , medicine , medical machinery , time or hope is going to bring back her back			0
so it 's really wrong and unethical for mr @entity13 to mislead the family and the public that there 's any amount of hope or any food that could possibly bring back this deceased young woman			2
' @entity2 left @entity19 's @entity108 about 7.50pm in a critical care ambulance to the home of her mom , @entity112			1
before today 's turn of events , the teenager 's uncle said the family was ' ecstatic '			2
hope : @entity2 's parents are hoping to transfer the little girl to a permanent care facility			1
while the exact center is unknown , @entity122 , who runs @entity123 in @entity124 has offered her services inspiration : @entity122 founded the facility after her father , @entity128 , sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007 ' i was with her when she left the hospital and the family is very grateful for this day , ' @entity78 said			1
' we are pleased she is away from @entity18 which has been trying to pull the plug on my niece since december 12			0
' we fought and we fought to make sure she had a chance at recovery			2
' she will now be treated like the precious little girl that she is			0
' the hospital last night said it wished the family ' closure ' over the traumatic affair			2
' our hearts go out to the family as they grieve for this sad situation and we wish them closure and peace , ' they said in a statement			0
the news comes after the girl 's family yesterday said they had ‘ everything in place ’ to move @entity2 from the hospital to a long term care facility			1
@entity13 said his clients had medical staff , transport and a new home for the teenager and were just about to ‘ get it all in motion ’			0
while it is not clear where the girl will be moved to , a @entity124 facility run by a woman whose father suffered severe brain trauma in 2007 has offered its services			1
@entity123 founder @entity122 said the outpatient rehabilitation facility has been named as a potential care center for @entity2			1
' we are aware of @entity2 's dire situation , and we are willing to open our outpatient facility to provide 24 - hour care as an inpatient , long - term facility for @entity2 with the required and appropriate medical staff that she depends upon , ' @entity122 said in a letter included in court documents last week , according to @entity186			1
war of words : @entity18 spokesman @entity87 ( right ) has accused @entity190 , the lawyer representing @entity2 's family ( left ) , of misleading people about @entity2 's likely recovery according to the facility 's website , @entity122 founded the facility after her father , @entity128 , sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident in 2007			1
seeing her father , a man of great strength and independence , inadequately cared for was an unacceptable frustration for @entity122 , the website says			0
the businesswoman told @entity206 she believes @entity2 could get better , with appropriate care			2
' her brain needs time to heal			0
it 's a new injury , ' @entity122 said			0
' we believe in life after injury , all of us here at @entity123 have first - hand experience because we have a loved one that was in the same situation as @entity2			2
' @entity2 's family has raised more than $ 47,000 on @entity217 to move her			1
according to the site , more than 1,300 people have donated money in nine days .			0
