a high school substitute teacher has been fired after police say he took pictures of his students without their knowledge and posted them to a perverted website			1
authorities in @entity8 say the former teacher at @entity10 secretly snapped several photos of his underage female students before posting them to @entity16 's @entity15 webpage for others to view and share			1
despite some of the photos appearing non suggestive , with at least one girl plainly sitting in her classroom chair , parents found their added captions disturbing , especially when describing teenaged girls			1
' i know that girl , and i know which teacher you are			1
i hope you 're looking forward to getting fired , you creepy a- - hole , ' the @entity16 user commented			1
school officials have since contacted the @entity50 sheriff 's office prompting an investigation of the teacher who has not been identified			1
the @entity54 's office tells @entity55 that the teacher has since been fired from the school system which claims to have conducted a background check on the man prior to his hiring that returned clean			1
rule change : immediately following news of the teacher 's behaviour @entity63 posted a rule change banning photos of those under the age of 18 as well as in or near a school criminal charges have not been filed			1
' fyi this is my daughter			0
this teacher is caught and being handled accordingly , ' a @entity16 user later commented on the girl 's photo that has since been removed			1
' yes he was a teacher ! ! ! ! she was not his only victim			2
i beg you to do everything you can to stop this from happening to innocent girls ! ! ! whoever turned him in , thank you ! ! ! even though there " are no laws broken " so far by this , hopefully your actions have at least put him on the radar of the local authorities ! ' they wrote			2
- @entity95 moderator on their @entity15 website @entity15 , which offers thousands of user - submitted pictures of women unknowingly photographed in public , often with the focus on their breasts or backsides , until recently had limited rules on its content			2
on thursday a new rule was posted on the forum banning photos taken ' on / in / around school settings or of " school girls " unless you can confirm that they are not minors			2
' ' there is nothing illegal about this subreddit , whatsoever , ' a moderator wrote with the posted rule change			0
' creepy , sinister , skin - crawling and generally downright distasteful ... yes			0
' on their upskirt forum , that publishes nude shots of women , rule changes mutually rippled over in a post by a moderator declaring voyeur shots now banned			0
' only posed upskirt shorts will be allowed ! ' the moderator wrote			0
the post caused immediate upset with one user writing that they 'd be now unsubscribing			2
' it 's unfortunate to lose those that choose to leave			0
but morally , ethically , and in some cases , legally , content slips in that will have this subreddit removed all together			0
removing some of the questionable content is what i 'll do			0
if i lose subscribers because of it , so be it , ' the moderator commented back			0
