having cancelled last @entity0 following a defeat at @entity2 , @entity3 is returning to @entity4 on saturday with a plan to reward his team ’s brilliant start to the season with a little more festive spirit			1
it will be a family bash , rather than a boozy night out , and will be squeezed among eight games in december as thanks for the ‘ clear change ’ in attitude during a campaign which has started without defeat in 19 games			2
‘ they are doing very well , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ probably because of that , the club is preparing a little @entity0 party for them and their families			1
’ @entity3 is in an excellent mood after @entity25 's superb unbeaten start to the season @entity25 players @entity28 ( left ) , @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity31 in training on thursday @entity34 goalkeeper @entity33 jumps to fist one away during the session at @entity36 last year , after losing at @entity2 in the @entity37 , plans for a players ’ night out were scrapped on the orders of the manager			1
‘ there are @entity0 parties and @entity0 parties , ’ the @entity25 boss said			1
‘ this is one the families deserve and the boys are very happy to be with their families			2
this is a squad with a lot of kids aged from a couple of weeks to 10 years old			2
it ’s good for them			2
for good things , we will find the time			0
‘ i have to go to say a couple of words and , after that , to leave them there with their families and kids			0
’ @entity25 are six points clear at the top of the @entity67 and eight ahead of champions @entity68			1
they are into the @entity37 quarter - finals and the last 16 of the @entity70 and the manager is confident a significant corner has been turned			2
‘ they have changed , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ there was an evolution in these young people , a clear evolution			0
i do n’t think the group can be complacent but it ’s not a risk we have because it ’s not the profile of this group			0
we were winning 5 - 0 against @entity83 in the 88th minute and @entity84 made a sprint to defend			0
minute 88 , winning 5 - 0			0
’ @entity84 is challenged for the ball by @entity87 during @entity25 's 5 - 0 win over @entity83 on tuesday @entity89 , along with @entity84 , has been nominated for the @entity90 in may @entity3 claimed @entity84 was not ready to sacrifice himself for the team but noted an improvement as he criticised @entity90 ’s @entity94 award , for which several @entity25 players are shortlisted , with @entity84 and @entity89 among the midfield nominees , revealed yesterday			1
‘ this kind of trophy is not good for football , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ sometimes it looks like we are looking for stars and people to be more important than others			0
this is not the culture we want in this club			0
‘ the mentality here is not to be obsessed with that			0
when i see these names , @entity89 and @entity84 , i think clearly they do n’t think about it			0
they think about the team , about playing well and trying to win matches			0
’ @entity118 could become the first manager to beat @entity3 three times in a row on saturday @entity2 ended @entity3 's 77 - game unbeaten run at @entity124 with a 2 - 1 win in april @entity2 ’s @entity118 can become the first manager to inflict three successive defeats on @entity3 with victory at the @entity128 on saturday			1
never , in 14 years in the dug - out , has the @entity129 suffered three straight losses at the hands of an opposite number			0
@entity2 were 2 - 1 winners in the @entity37 quarter - final in december and repeated the scoreline in april to end @entity3 ’s 77 - match unbeaten run at @entity124			1
and , for once , former @entity25 midfielder @entity118 is relieved that the omens rest with his side			1
he said : ‘ we ’re usually on the wrong end of stats			0
we had n’t won for ages on a monday night and we did n’t beat someone for 50 years , but now we ’re on the right side , so let me enjoy it			1
