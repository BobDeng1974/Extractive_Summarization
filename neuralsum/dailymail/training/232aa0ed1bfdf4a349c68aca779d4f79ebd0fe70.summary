a sense of belonging to the middle class occupies a cherished place in @entity3			1
it conjures images of self - sufficient people with stable jobs and pleasant homes working toward prosperity			1
yet nearly five years after the @entity11 ended , more people are coming to the painful realization that they 're no longer part of it			1
they are former professionals now stocking shelves at grocery stores , retirees struggling with rising costs and people working part - time jobs but desperate for full - time pay			1
such setbacks have emerged in economic statistics for several years			2
now they 're affecting how @entity3 think of themselves			2
forty percent now identify as either lower - middle or lower class compared with just 25 percent in february 2008			1
according to @entity42 , the percentage of @entity3 who say they 're middle or upper - middle class fell 8 points between 2008 and 2012 , to 55 percent			1
and the most recent @entity44 , conducted by @entity45 at the @entity46 , found that the vast proportion of @entity3 who call themselves middle or working class , though still high at 88 percent , is the lowest in the survey 's 40 - year history			1
it 's fallen 4 percentage points since the recession began in 2007			2
the trend reflects a widening gap between the richest @entity3 and everyone else , one that 's emerged gradually over decades and accelerated with the @entity11			1
the difference between the income earned by the wealthiest 5 percent of @entity3 and by a median - income household has risen 24 percent in 30 years , according to the @entity61			1
in decline and we know it : a @entity37 study found earlier this year that the percentage of @entity3 who self - identify as middle class has fallen significantly in recent years whether or not people see themselves as middle class , there 's no agreed - upon definition of the term			1
in part , it 's a state of mind			2
incomes or lifestyles that feel middle class in @entity78 can feel far different in @entity79			1
people with substantial incomes often identify as middle class if they live in urban centers with costly food , housing and transportation			1
in any case , individuals and families who feel they 've slipped from the middle class are likely to spend and borrow less			1
such a pullback , in turn , squeezes the economy , which is fueled mainly by consumer spending			2
‘ how they think is reflected in how they act , ’ said @entity95 , a senior editor at the @entity37			2
people are generally slow to acknowledge downward mobility			2
many regard themselves as middle class even if their incomes fall well above or below the average			1
experts say the rise in @entity3 who feel they 've slipped below the middle class suggests something deeply rooted			1
more people now think ‘ it 's harder to achieve ’ the @entity3 dream than thought so several decades ago , said @entity111 , a sociology professor at @entity112 in @entity113			2
three years ago , @entity114 , 47 , and her husband earned a combined $ 80,000			2
she considered herself solidly middle class			1
the couple and their four children regularly vacationed at a lake near their home in @entity123 , @entity124			0
part - time woes : @entity126 lost his job at a warehouse and then went back to school			2
now he works part - time at a call center constant searching : @entity132 of @entity133 has been searching since 2011 for a job that pays as well as his last position as a purchasing agent for @entity137 but in august 2012 , @entity114 was laid off from her job as a special education teacher			2
she 's since managed to find only part - time teaching work			2
though her husband still works as a truck salesman , their income has sunk by more than half to $ 36,000			0
‘ now we 're on the upper end of lower class , ’ @entity114 said			1
@entity3 ' self - perception coincides with data documenting a shrinking middle class : the percentage of households with income within 50 percent of the median — one way to define a broad middle class — fell from 50 percent in 1970 to 42 percent in 2010			1
the @entity37 survey did n't ask respondents to specify their income			0
still , @entity37 has found in the past that people who call themselves middle class generally fit the broad definitions that economists use			1
roughly 8.4 percent of respondents to the @entity44 , last conducted in 2012 , said they consider themselves lower class			1
that 's the survey 's highest percentage ever , up from 5.4 percent in 2006			2
@entity45 is a social science research organization at the @entity46			0
@entity170 , director of the survey , said even slight shifts are significant			0
class self - identification ‘ is traditionally one of the most stable measures ’ in the survey , he said			1
by contrast to the most recent recession , the severe 1981 - 82 downturn had little effect on class self - identification in @entity170 's survey			1
why do so many no longer regard themselves as middle class ? a key reason is that the recession eliminated 8.7 million jobs			1
a disproportionate number were middle - income positions			1
those losses left what economists describe as a ‘ hollowed out ’ workforce , with more higher - and lower - paying and fewer middle - income jobs			1
@entity132 , 30 , has n't yet found a job that paid as well as the purchasing agent position at @entity137 's defense division that he left in 2011			0
nervous about the sustainability of that job because of government defense cuts , @entity132 quit after buying a bar near his @entity113 home			0
the bar eventually went bankrupt and cost him his house			0
he and his wife moved to @entity133 , @entity204 , where he 's had little luck finding work in defense contracting			0
now , he works in the produce section of a supermarket			0
his wife earns the bulk of their income as a speech pathologist			0
their household income has been cut in half , from $ 110,000 to $ 55,000 , and he and his wife have put off having children			0
‘ it 's definitely been a step back , ’ @entity132 said			0
now living in an apartment , he misses the couple 's three - bedroom house on a quiet cul - de - sac in a @entity113 suburb			2
home ownership is among factors economists cite as markers of middle - class status			1
others include being able to vacation , help children pay for college and save for a secure retirement			0
yet stagnant middle - class pay , combined with steep price increases for college , health care and homes , have made those expenses harder to afford			1
median household income , adjusted for inflation , has n't budged since 1996 , according to the @entity61			0
average college tuition has soared 174 percent in that time			2
many of the formerly middle class are still struggling with student debt			1
@entity132 , who has an mba , estimates he 'll be making $ 600 payments on student loans each month for the next decade			0
@entity114 , with two master 's degrees , says she has ‘ lots and lots of debt			0
’ and she is n't prepared to help her children pay for college			0
‘ there 's no money to help them , ’ she said			0
some people feel they 've fallen out of the middle class even as their incomes have remained stable , because their costs have risen			1
one is @entity263 , 66 , a retired postal employee in @entity264 , @entity265 he 's been living off his pension since retiring five years ago			0
his wife , a sales manager at a hotel and conference center , has n't had a raise in that time			0
the recession hammered the hotel 's business , though it 's slowly recovering			0
yet his cost of living has risen in the past decade or so			0
gas prices have surged over that time			0
and only this year did the value of @entity263 's retirement savings regain its level of six years ago			0
‘ i see my position in the social structure having gone down a notch , ’ @entity263 said			0
he considers himself lower - middle class , compared with middle class a few years ago			1
a slowly improving @entity3 economy could lift some people back into the middle class			1
still , the recession and slow recovery have left permanent scars			0
@entity132 and his wife are trying to rebuild their savings			0
they no longer have credit cards			0
@entity263 travels much less than he thought he would in retirement			0
‘ i have really beat myself up a lot over the last 2½ years , ’ @entity132 said			0
‘ until i get myself up and going again and in a good place ... it is tough			0

the @entity11 has greatly widened the already growing gap between the richest and everyone else
40 percent now identify as either lower - middle or lower class compared with just 25 percent in february 2008
