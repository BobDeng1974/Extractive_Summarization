by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:55 pm on 19th january 2012 president @entity2 rejected @entity4 's plan to build the @entity5 to @entity7 crude oil pipeline , saying he ’s denying the application because a @entity10 - mandated deadline did n’t allow time for a full review			1
mr @entity2 says his decision is n't a judgment on the merits of the proposed $ 7billion pipeline			2
rather , he 's citing the ' arbitrary nature ' of the february 21 deadline that was set by a @entity10 - written provision in a recent tax bill that mr @entity2 signed			1
against it : demonstrators carried a giant mock pipeline while calling for the cancellation of the @entity25 during a rally in @entity27 november 6 of last year the president said in a statement that he 's disappointed that @entity10 in @entity30 forced the decision			2
mr @entity2 had until late next month to decide whether the pipeline was in the national interest			0
administration officials says the looming deadline cut short the time needed to conduct environmental reviews after the @entity37 ordered the project developer to find an alternate route to avoid environmentally sensitive areas of @entity41			1
all roads lead to @entity43 : the route of the proposed @entity25 oil pipeline which is opposed by environmentalist groups goes through delicate areas of @entity41 pipes in waiting : pipes are laid out and waiting to be installed in @entity49 the $ 7billion pipeline would run through six states and carry oil from @entity5 to @entity54 refineries , passing through an environmentally sensitive area of @entity41			1
according to a source close to the matter : ' the time provided in the @entity59 is not adequate for the @entity37 to gain the additional information needed			0
' ‘ the @entity37 's recommendation of denial of the ... permit at this time is based on not having the necessary information			0
man your battle stations : @entity10 speaker of the house @entity68 and other @entity10 leaders are expected to challenge mr @entity2 's ruling ' it does not preclude any subsequent permit application of application for similar project , ’ the source told @entity77			1
the @entity10 has pounded @entity2 over the issue , saying it 's a question of whether he wants to create jobs and import energy from an ally , or lose jobs and see @entity5 oil go to @entity85 instead			1
the pipeline proposal has forced the @entity87 to make a politically risky choice between two important @entity90 constituencies			0
many unions back the project because of the prospects of new jobs in a down economy			0
in brief : press secretary @entity97 hinted earlier in the day that the @entity2 administration would reject the pipleline decision earlier today environmentalists argue that the pipeline would create a risk of calamitous oil spills , as well as an influx of greenhouse gasses			2
some liberal donors threatened to cut off funds to mr @entity2 's re-election campaign to protest the project , which opponents say would transport ' dirty oil ' that requires huge amounts of energy to extract			2
@entity4 says the project could create as many as 20,000 jobs over two years ; opponents say that figure is inflated			0
a @entity37 report last summer said the pipeline would create up to 6,000 jobs during construction .			0

@entity2 says he 's denying application because of @entity10 - mandated deadline
@entity127 would carry oil from @entity5 to @entity54 , but also environmentally sensitive areas of @entity41
@entity10 argues pipeline could create *200,000* jobs
