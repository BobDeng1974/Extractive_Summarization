a potentially historic @entity0 is churning its way toward the @entity2 with potential hurricane force wind gusts and blizzard conditions dumping as much as two feet of snow in some places on friday and saturday			1
while the actual trajectory for the storm is still unknown , @entity7 could get around 10 inches and @entity10 could get slammed with as much as two feet with winds gusts up to 55 mph			1
a blizzard watch is now in effect starting friday morning for much of @entity15 and @entity16 with travel not recommended amid fears of dangerous white out conditions , the @entity12 reports			1
they report the heaviest snow to begin falling on friday night into saturday morning with 2 - 3 inches per hour possible and visibility less than a quarter of a mile or less at times			1
just south , most of @entity48 is under its own winter storm watch with snow likely to begin falling by early friday morning and develop into heavier snowfall throughout the afternoon			1
heavy rain , snow , and wind gusts possibly more than 50 mph are expected throughout @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and up into @entity58 , @entity34 creating fears of potential power outages in freezing conditions and drifting and blowing snow making roads impassable according to @entity35			1
' as always in the winter season we are prepared for whatever @entity67 brings , ' @entity66 spokesman @entity65 told the @entity69 of their 365 salt - spreaders standing by			0
' once we get a weather forecast that looks like the threat of snow , we have them pre-loaded			2
they ’re our first line of defense , ' he said			0
widespread minor flooding and moderate flooding along shoreline communities is also expected , potentially causing moderate to significant beach erosion among some of the hardest hit areas less than four months after @entity85			0
the @entity86 reports that the @entity40 storm pattern , which passed through @entity88 and @entity89 , will mix with wetter weather coming from @entity91 , @entity92 , and even @entity93			0
bundling up : on friday snow , seen in blue , is expected to blanket parts of the northeast while accompanying patches of ice , seen in pink and purple @entity101 : municipal trucks fill up with salt wednesday in @entity104 , @entity105 in preparations for what could be a large snowfall weekend forecast : a 25 - hour snow map released by @entity35 shows the northeast for february 9 through the 10th with the region easily seen hit the hardest days ahead : a weather map shows the projected snowfall across the northeast for the next 48 hours before the start of friday 's storm by thursday night , forecasts predict that the clipper system will travel from the @entity120 region to the @entity22 , passing through @entity121 , @entity55 , and up towards @entity10			1
@entity122 and @entity123 are also under the threat of significant snowfall , according to the @entity35			0
but other weather forecasters say that there will be little accumulation in @entity55 and @entity121 , instead forecasting rain and sleet			0
the contrasting situation of monstrous proportions - causing some to estimate seeing 38 - inches of snow dumped on @entity7 - rests on the interaction between a small weather system near @entity88 and another off the @entity139 coast that has yet to form , the @entity132 reports			1
if the two storms merge the massive snow fall is expected to pound the full northeast area			1
if it misses one another - even by 50 miles - the storm would be expected to shift its weight further north , sparing @entity7 instead with rain and light snow			1
' crunching all that data together inside my little weather brain , i have n’t seen anything that argues convincingly for more than six inches of snow in the five boroughs , ' @entity132 's @entity148 reports			0
' the @entity12 agrees , ' he continues , ' although totals could quickly increase further northward into @entity57			0
more likely , the city will get two to five inches of slush mixed with rain			0
' the runaround : @entity55 has experienced little snowfall this winter , but instead endured a bitter cold snap last month with single - digit temperatures blanketed : a horse grazes in a snow - covered field in @entity164 , @entity55 on monday , an area expected to see 6 - 12 - inches of snow come friday moving in : an @entity35 satellite image taken wednesday shows a low pressure system off the eastern @entity169 with a frontal boundary over the @entity2 and @entity171 with snow showers frigid : a projected map for the @entity169 late this week shows temperatures dipping into the single digits in parts of the northeast @entity121 is also expected to be hit with 2 - 4 - inches of snow , beginning overnight on thursday and continuing into friday , with rain in the southern areas of the region			1
around @entity183 , @entity34 , gusts are expected up to 55 mph at the @entity184 and 40 mph inland			2
@entity185 , which has seen little snowfall this season , will likely get rain			0
@entity7 has been largely spared its usual snowfall , which averages at around 25 inches as of february			2
this year , there has been less than eight inches of snowfall in the city			0
last year , too , proved to be a dry winter for @entity7 , with a similar average accumulation			2
similarly @entity10 has only had 9.6 inches since december 1 , putting it 14.3 inches below normal			2
earlier this year , much of the country was hit with a vicious cold snap , with punishing winds and @entity200 temperatures causing temperatures to plummet well below freezing .			0

@entity10 could get up to two feet of snow and @entity7 about half that in weekend storm as two storm systems merge
@entity10 under blizzard watch friday through saturday with hurricane force wind gusts expected
forecasts are varied and some predict the majority of snowfall will be further north
