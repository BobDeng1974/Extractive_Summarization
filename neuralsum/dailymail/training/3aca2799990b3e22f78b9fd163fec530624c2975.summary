by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 15:13 est , 27 december 2012 with its penny arcades , pleasure beach and purveyors of cockles and whelks , the classic @entity2 seaside resort of @entity3 may seem slightly outdated to some			1
and thanks to cheap flights and mini-breaks abroad , the @entity11 town no longer has the same appeal as a holiday destination compared to its 1960s ' heyday			1
despite this , @entity3 has now become a hub for thousands of commuters - and over the past year , house prices in the area have skyrocketed faster than anywhere else in @entity25			1
experts have ascribed the extraordinary property boom to its well - known grammar schools , as well as seafront attractions such as the world 's longest pier , @entity33 theme park and dozens of green spaces			1
average house prices in the town , which is 45 minutes from central @entity37 , rose by 14.8 per cent over 2012 , according to research published today			1
@entity40 prices in @entity3 have skyrocketed faster than anywhere else in @entity25			1
this map shows the largest rises and falls in house prices across the @entity25 over the course of 2012 good free schools : the ' grammar school effect ' in @entity3 , @entity11 , is a result of many middle - class parents no longer being able to afford private school fees the resort saw the steepest rise in selling prices of major @entity25 towns and cities over the last 12 month , with homes now going for an average of £ 198,418 , according to research by @entity60			1
the town ’s popularity is thought to have been boosted by its secondary schools , eight of which award some or all of their places according to ability in entrance tests			2
other @entity25 towns which boast grammar schools and feature in the top 10 for house prices rises this year include @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 in @entity76 and nearby @entity77			1
@entity78 , chairman of the @entity79 , said applications to sit the 11 - plus schools were increasing in many areas , particularly among families who are no longer able to stretch to private school fees			0
‘ with the credit crunch , a number of middle - class families who could , with a bit of a push , have afforded an independent school are now looking for an equally good education at a much reduced cost ’ , he said			0
‘ there is also no doubt that people are continuing to flee from poor comprehensive schools			0
’ @entity3 ’s grammars were a ‘ big attraction ’ for families seeking high - performing schools within commuting distance to @entity37 , he said			2
experts have ascribed the extraordinary property boom n @entity3 to its well - known grammar schools , as well as seafront attractions such as the world 's longest pier , @entity33 theme park and dozens of green spaces face lift : the new @entity111 is one of several fairly recent additions to the town 's landscape in demand : property prices in ' grammar school town ' @entity3 - on - sea has risen by nearly 15 per cent the town has four fully selective schools - two for boys and two for girls - and a further four which are partially selective , offering a proportion of their places on merit			1
mr @entity78 added : ‘ some people are prepared to move from anywhere in the country to an area where their children can go to a grammar school			0
in three quarters of the @entity25 there are no grammar schools			1
‘ whether it is a grammar or a good comprehensive , all the evidence of the recent past is that people are buying houses in areas where they will be near good schools			2
’ some 164 grammar schools remain in @entity2 , spread across 36 out of 150 local education authorities			1
they are most plentiful in @entity76 , @entity147 , @entity11 , @entity148 , @entity149 and parts of @entity151 but large swathes of the country have none			2
mr @entity78 said many areas which had held onto their grammars were places of relative wealth , where families were prepared to pay a hefty premium on property prices to be in the locality of top - performing schools			1
but demand for places far outstrips supply , he said			0
@entity3 14.8 % ( £ 198,418 ) @entity167 14.7 % ( £ 220,320 ) @entity73 13.3 % ( £ 184,908 ) @entity168 13 % ( £ 371,131 ) @entity74 13 % ( £ 209,557 ) @entity169 12.7 % ( £ 145,844 ) @entity170 12.6 % ( £ 133,878 ) @entity75 12.4 % ( £ 171,106 ) @entity171 11.7 % ( £ 309,891 ) @entity77 11.5 % ( £ 286,482 ) @entity172 -18.4 % ( £ 91,530 ) @entity173 -12.5 % ( £ 87,410 ) @entity174 -9.4 % ( £ 125,156 ) @entity175 -9.3 % ( £ 123,100 ) @entity176 -9.3 % ( £ 160,375 ) @entity177 -8.9 % ( £ 96,478 ) @entity178 -8.2 % ( £ 116,352 ) @entity179 -7.9 % ( £ 157,679 ) @entity180 -7.4 % ( £ 121,433 ) @entity181 -7.3 % ( £ 178,864 ) today ’s table of house price gains and falls shows that three areas which are among the top five performers have grammars - @entity3 , @entity73 and @entity74			2

@entity174 , @entity175 and the @entity176 , all in northern @entity2 , made up the rest of the bottom five			0
nine of the 10 towns which saw the biggest declines in prices are outside the south of @entity2 , reflecting the continued regional divide in the property market			0

this picture , however , conceals considerable local differences			0
