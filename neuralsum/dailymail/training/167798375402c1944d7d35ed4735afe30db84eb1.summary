by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 13:53 est , 28 march 2013 a bogus lawyer has been sentenced 14 years in prison for duping ' desperate and vulnerable victims ' into thinking he was a bona fide legal professional			2
@entity6 , 57 , became known as the @entity7 for taking on ' unwinnable ' cases with a client list including road rage killer @entity10 and timeshare fraudster @entity13			1
despite no legal training , the fraudster managed to win some of his cases			1
but his high - flying legal career was brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of 25 charges including deception , fraud and money laundering between 2001 and 2011			2
behind bars : @entity6 , pictured arriving at @entity23 ahead of his sentencing for fraud , was today jailed for 14 years no ordinary lawyer : @entity6 built up a reputation for defending the seemingly indefensible			1
now he has been convicted on 25 charges including deception , fraud and money laundering today @entity6 , who was briefly a director of @entity30 in 2003 , pleaded guilty to another two counts of fraud and a further three counts were ordered to lie on file at @entity35 ’s @entity23			1
as he stepped out of the dock after hearing his sentence , @entity6 told the judge in a loud voice : ' i am obliged , my lord '			1
judge @entity42 , the recorder of @entity44 , noted there were many offences over significant periods of time			2
he said the fact that the victims , which included a disabled man seeking damages for the loss of an arm , were all ' desperate and vulnerable ' and faced losses which were not just financial but also included the ' raising and dashing of false hope ' were aggravating factors			0
the 57 - year - old conned clients out of millions of pounds by setting himself up as a lawyer when he had no legal qualifications and was not registered to work as a lawyer in @entity65 or the @entity66			1
he used the @entity68 word ' avvocato ' on business cards , letterheads and identification documents to give clients - and the judiciary - the impression he was an advocate			0
@entity6 as he arrives back at @entity23 to face charges of fraud @entity6 has represented some of @entity66 's most notorious criminals @entity6 acted for @entity80 , a career @entity82 criminal , best known for being the first person accused of killing @entity82 investigative journalist @entity85 , which he denied until his death the judge told @entity6 : ' i recognise that you did not actively seek out those whom you defrauded			1
you did not approach them but there is more than one kind of predator			0
' some predators hunt down their victims , others lie in wait for them			0
' your victims in this case were all desperate people and people who , because of their desperation , were vulnerable			0
' the judge also noted that , while this case is about money , ' it is also about something different and great - it is about the real distress you caused to so many people '			0
' you had no regard for them nor for their anguish , ' he said			0
' your only concern was to line your own pockets			0
' during the trial , @entity6 told of his links to @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and his ' friendship ' with the daughter of @entity127			1
the court was shown a 2004 @entity130 documentary in which he described @entity124 as a ' nice guy ' and boasted of being asked to defend killers such as @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity10 and @entity135			1
he was born in the small town of @entity137 in central @entity65 , but moved to the @entity66 as a boy and went to school in @entity140 , @entity141			0
prosecutor @entity142 had told the jury that di @entity6 had gained fame for handling clients ' whose cases others considered unwinnable or too difficult to defend '			1
but he did in fact win some cases , overturning a manslaughter conviction against @entity151 in 2002 and getting him released from prison			2
in 2003 , @entity6 secured the release of @entity154 from prison on a technicality , with only a fine of £ 33million for timeshare fraud , which @entity13 later avoided paying			1
not best director : @entity6 was briefly on the board at @entity30 former @entity30 director @entity6 ( right ) pictured at a press conference with team manager @entity162 ( left ) and new signing @entity163 pop guru @entity165 ( centre ) , who was convicted of a series of sexual assaults on teenage boys , with his lawyer @entity6 the harm that di @entity6 inflicted was ' in financial terms alone high ' , said the judge			1
but he added : ' in terms of emotional harm , it was much greater - the building of false hopes , always and inevitably dashed , followed by years of misery and frustration as they tried to recover what you had stolen and in the end were forced to come to terms with their financial loss			0
' the judge said @entity6 had ' lied ' to his victims about what he was capable of and who he was			1
his crimes were ' planned and persistent ' and some of his attempts to defend his behaviour in court amounted to ' breathtaking cynicism ' , the judge noted			0
@entity6 , of @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , was found guilty of nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception , eight counts of fraud , three counts of acquiring criminal property , two counts of using a false instrument , one count of attempting to obtain a money transfer by deception , one count of obtaining property by deception and one count of using criminal property			1
today he pleaded guilty to stealing £ 150,000 compensation that should have gone to a man who had lost an arm in a car crash			0
the money was due as part of an insurance policy but @entity6 had it paid in to his business account and ' duly stole it '			2
the court was told it was a ' wicked ' crime and is one which ' stands in a league of its own '			0
the bogus lawyer also admitted defrauding engineer @entity232 and his family of £ 160,000 including the £ 75,000 life savings of his partner 's mother			2
this case also involved £ 20,000 costs which were not paid out			0
due to the ' utterly wrong ' advice that di @entity6 gave him - ' to protect your own position ' - he lost his home and his job .			2

@entity6 , 57 , earned *nickname* for taking on difficult cases
but despite no legal training , he won some of his cases
he said he had links to @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124
@entity6 also *claimed* to be friends with @entity127 's daughter
