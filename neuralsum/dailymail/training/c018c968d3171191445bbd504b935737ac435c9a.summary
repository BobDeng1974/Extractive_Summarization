local children have started calling @entity1 the ' @entity32 ' , and she has taken to charging a 10 yuan fee to have a picture taken with her in popular tourist venues			2

single @entity8 man @entity13 , 40 , thought his 75 - year - old mum ( pictured ) was taking the @entity3 when she said she intended to get a job to help him to find a girlfriend			1
but he realised @entity1 , 75 , was serious when she turned up with a second - hand @entity3 costume ' then i saw some pictures of people who had gone to @entity75 and been photographed with some of the characters , and i thought to myself that not everybody would be able to afford to go to @entity75 to be seen with @entity3			1
' so i decided to bring @entity3 to them			0
' i moved here with my husband and my son in 1987 , and the future seemed bright , but it did n't work out after my husband and i divorced in 1996 and we have n't been able to get on our feet financially ever since			0
' my son is quite depressed that he is getting on now and has still not managed to find a partner			0
that was why i decided to help him			0
' @entity1 has to take frequent breaks ( right ) from the costume , saying that extended periods dressed in it can cause her to have trouble breathing			1
nevertheless , she continues to work for her son 's benefit , despite the fact the purchase of the costume , and business plan , was his to begin with but while the costume might have positive effects on @entity103 , it has had negative effects on his mother			2
she said : ' the costume is too heavy , there is little air inside			0
' if i wear it for a long time i can not breathe			0
' park visitor @entity111 , 37 , said : ' it really hurts to see her dressed like that			0
she is so old and should live a much easier life now			0
