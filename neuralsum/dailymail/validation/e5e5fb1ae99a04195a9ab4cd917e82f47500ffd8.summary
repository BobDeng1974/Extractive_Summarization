@entity7 stepped down to help the city ' begin its healing process ' , he said it is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the ' racially biased ' emails included in the 102 - page civil rights report			1
the @entity65 reports that @entity47 was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that president @entity67 would not complete a full presidential term because a black man ca n't hold ' a steady job for four years '			0
@entity46 is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a @entity73 woman was paid by ' @entity74 ' to terminate her pregnancy			0
the @entity3 highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless , appearingly tribal , women dancing , with the caption ' @entity84 's @entity83			2
' the report states that the emails illustrate racial , ethnic , or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the @entity3 's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week			1

' ' this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized , ' @entity127 said			0

the @entity3 's civil rights investigation into the @entity65 suburb of 21,000 came after a white @entity1 police officer , @entity158 ( right ) fatally shot an unarmed black teen , @entity6 ( left ) on aug. 9 the grand jury 's decision not to indict the @entity1 police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast @entity1 's mostly white police force in a negative light @entity152 did not comment on whether police chief @entity166 would step down , @entity151 reports , amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders			0
the report highlighted the department 's practices , saying the city 's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department 's approach to law enforcement and the role of @entity1 's municipal court			1

court records and emails show that while african - americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets , city officials including the @entity214 , the court clerk , and department supervisors helped their friends , colleagues , and even themselves in eliminating tickets , fees , fines , and citations			1
the report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help			0
the clerk responded : ' your ticket of $ 200 has magically disappeared ! the report found that some practices of the @entity42 violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the @entity204 , which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause .			1
