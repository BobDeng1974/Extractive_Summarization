hiding place : @entity2 took a water bottle and his mobile phone with him inside the divan bed and used a knife to fashion a spyhole in the bed base , through which he watched police scouring the scene for clues miss @entity4 was interested in music and performing arts but took a job as a hotel receptionist to help her mother out financially			1
she had separated from her boyfriend @entity129 but they had got back together at the time of her death			0
miss @entity4 was looking forward to taking the trip of a lifetime to see her aunt @entity135 get married in @entity136 and was due to fly out a week after the killing			1

several friends had been at their flat that night and @entity2 and others had taken poppers - a well known muscle relaxant			2
@entity2 launched his attack after he was left alone with his victims			2
he told the court that in the room they lay on the bed and both men took it in turns to perform sex acts on miss @entity4			1

the alarm was not raised until around 3pm the next day when all three failed to show up to work the late shift at the hotel			0
police forced entry and were confronted with a bloodbath - but @entity2 was nowhere to be found			2
they initially believed he could have jumped out of a window or had been hiding in the flat ’s loft			0
another theory was that he had stashed a clean pair of shoes outside the door and used them to make his getaway without leaving a tell - tale trail of blood			0
it was only two days later that a forensic examiner noticed the bedroom door , which had previously been left open , was now shut			0

he had spent hours inside and had even defecated inside the divan			2
@entity2 claimed he had reached from a hole in the bed to grab a bottle of mineral water when the police were actually in the room			1
police said it did not occur to them @entity2 was still in the room - and they would not have moved the bed for fear of disturbing forensic evidence			1
det insp @entity225 , of the @entity227 ’s homicide and serious crime command , said : ' the concept of him hiding out in a bed for two days with a dead man he has killed and dumped on top of him is beyond belief			2
' police say it is possible @entity2 was able to rearrange the crime scene - but stressed the public were never at risk			2
@entity239 , for @entity2 , said the killer ’s actions in bathing mr @entity3 before leaving him posed were ' perhaps some kind of homage to @entity3 '			1
speaking about hiding in the bed , he added : ' i would suggest it ’s not a matter to hold against him			0
he himself said he felt like he wanted to die and if they [ the police ] came in they would save him			0
' on the second night he certainly was n’t trying to conceal the fact he was there because he came out and changed a large number of things to make clear his presence			0
' @entity2 was deeply remorseful and wanted to plead guilty to murder , he told the court			2
the killer also offered - through mr @entity261 - to meet his victim 's parents in a bid to help them grieve			0
' it might be that in months , or more likely years , to come , if he did remember more of what happened that would be a realistic prospect , ' said the lawyer			0
