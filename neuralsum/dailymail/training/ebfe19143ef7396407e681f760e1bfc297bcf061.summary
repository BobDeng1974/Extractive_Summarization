to call this @entity0 would be a major disservice to one of the finest names in tactical gaming			1
for bar the well - realised time period , @entity5 : @entity8 is nothing but another generic third - person shooter with @entity0 elements uncomfortably shoe - horned in			1
set in the 1960s , you play agent @entity15 – the leader of a three - man squad sent to investigate various alien attacks			2
negative space : @entity20 gets repetitive very quickly - despite @entity22 's best efforts in enemy variation to its credit , the uninspired combat holds up well			1
using a @entity28 - style command and abilities wheel spliced with a @entity31 cover - system , battles often involve sending your teammates down the flanks to draw fire , while you attack from the other side			2
each of your squaddies have their own abilities – for example the engineer can deploy a floating turret and the sniper has a useful @entity44 shot			0
but where it falls down is in its implementation of a key @entity0 principle – that being ; when a character dies , they stay dead			1
although your squad mates can die if not revived , main character @entity15 can not – his fatality merely causing a respawn of the entire squad at the previous checkpoint			0
thus , throughout the game ’s 15 - hour campaign , you never feel connected to the character in the same way you were your squad in @entity0 : @entity62			1
there 's no sense of urgency because you know a checkpoint is always there to save you			1
sure , it ’s slightly annoying when a high - level squadmate is downed , but they all have no personality or character – and are replaced by yet another bot from a limitless supply of @entity77 - controlled drones			2
weapons , too , have no wow factor			0
all seem slightly muted , with even the largest alien guns coming across as completely limp			2
another element uncomfortably borrowed from @entity62 is player choice , and it 's commendable that @entity5 – given its frequent delays in development – has kept this element in			0
however , choices are too black and white often not presenting a moral dilemma but a clear cut : be nice , be nasty scenario			0
@entity93 voice acting and average lip synching do the dialogue sections no favours , either			1
you can even run around @entity5 's hq - but apart from the odd mini-game , it 's incredibly dull			1
boring : there are some nice touches but for the most part there 's little to make @entity5 stand out but by far the biggest nail in @entity5 ’s coffin is the lack of co-operative multiplayer			2
in sticking so rigidly to the rules of the @entity0 universe ( that being , once your teammates die , they die ) , they ’ve missed a golden opportunity to lift this game away from average			1
but even then , thrills would be predictable and offer nothing other titles – for example @entity31 – do better			0
the @entity5 is n’t a bad game			0
and in this day and age , that can be the kiss of death			0
the @entity5 : @entity8 is out now			0
let us know what you think on @entity127 : @ @entity128 and on @entity129 : @entity130 .			0

solid but completely uninspired third - person *gameplay*
well - realised time period and *interesting* *environments*
@entity0 's ' once you **'re** dead , you **'re** dead ' *mechanic* just does *n't* work with your team - losing that *trademark* sense of urgency
no multiplayer
@entity93 voice acting and average graphics
