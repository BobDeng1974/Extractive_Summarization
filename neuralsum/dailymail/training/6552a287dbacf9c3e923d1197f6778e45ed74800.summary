@entity0 could have signed for @entity1 back in 2006 but the club and then - coach @entity3 decided the player was too lazy			1
@entity0 tormented @entity6 's @entity1 side on tuesday night , his hat - trick leading @entity8 to a late 3 - 2 victory in the @entity10			1
but the @entity12 striker may well have been playing for the @entity14 team had history taken a slightly different course			0
@entity17 a 16 - year - old @entity0 score a stunning solo goal @entity0 could have sealed a move to @entity1 back in 2006 , when he was 17 @entity8 striker @entity0 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity1 on tuesday night @entity1 first team coach @entity3 felt the 17 - year - old was too lazy and that his time scouting was wasted @entity1 were one of the first @entity27 teams to investigate signing @entity0 in 2006 , when the then 17 - year - old was playing for @entity30 side @entity29 , the @entity24 press reminded readers on wednesday			1
@entity32 tried to push through a deal resigned to selling @entity0 , the @entity35 club were demanding £ 12million , a fee which @entity1 's then general manager @entity37 was reluctant to pay			1
@entity1 , for all their big spending , have always made a point of not being held to ransom by other clubs			0
@entity37 ' colleague @entity32 , however , attempted to push the deal through , arguing that , ' he ( @entity0 ) would n't be a bargain , but he is very talented			2
' we need to get in before the @entity47 and the @entity48 , otherwise it will be seriously expensive '			0
@entity37 thus attended an @entity29 game during a trip to @entity12 , but remained unconvinced by @entity0 's work rate			1
in an interview with @entity55 in 2011 , the @entity1 boss said : ' his team mates were warming up , and @entity0 was just leaning on the fence			2
the only thing he did in the whole game was to win and score a penalty '			0
those words may have come back to haunt @entity37 , now in prison for tax evasion , as he saw @entity0 win and score a penalty for @entity8 against @entity1			2
rather than the £ 12m being demanded for @entity0 , @entity37 made an offer of £ 4m , and was laughed off by @entity29			1
still unsure , @entity37 then decided to send @entity1 's first team coach at the time , none other than @entity69 flop @entity3 , to see what he thought of @entity0			1
after flying to @entity71 and watching one match , @entity3 came back immensely frustrated			0
@entity0 has gone on to become one of the best strikers in world football but was n't worth £ 12m in 2006 ' never waste my free time again ' , he told @entity37 , ' it 's too precious to watch a player who does nothing but stand around for the whole game '			1
thus @entity1 's verdict was complete			0
@entity0 , who would later sign for @entity81 , and of course @entity8 , was too lazy , too expensive , and not gifted enough for @entity1			2
signing him at the age of 17 would have been too risky , and potentially harmful to the club			0
eight years later , it turns out that @entity37 and @entity3 were right			0
@entity0 did hurt @entity1 after all .			0

@entity0 could have moved to @entity1 in 2006 for £ 12m
but first team coach @entity3 decided the striker was too lazy
@entity3 told @entity1 ' never waste my free time again ' after watching @entity0
the then 17 - year - old ' would n't have been a bargain , ' said @entity37
@entity0 's hat - trick put @entity1 to the *sword* in the @entity10
