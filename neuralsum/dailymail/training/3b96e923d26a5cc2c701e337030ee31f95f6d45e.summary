on a night when @entity1 football seeks redemption in the @entity3 , @entity5 's presence on the touchline in the @entity7 may cause further angst for the under - fire world champions			1
home fans of a mature vintage can recall the central role played by @entity5 , as a player , when @entity14 lost two games in a qualifying campaign for the first , and so far , only time			1
on november 16 , 1983 , @entity5 captained @entity18 to a famous 1 - 0 win over @entity14 in @entity20 — the same day , incidentally , the @entity17 mauled @entity21 8 - 0			1
@entity17 manager @entity5 believes @entity14 will qualify for @entity22 comfortably midfielder @entity24 ( centre ) scores in the @entity17 's 7 - 0 thrashing of @entity27 at the @entity28 @entity29 grabs @entity18 's winning goal against @entity14 in @entity20 in 1983 it followed a 1 - 0 win in @entity33 a year earlier , yet @entity35 's battlers were cruelly denied a place in the 1984 @entity38 finals on goal difference by the team they conquered			1
to this day , @entity14 have never lost twice in the qualifiers for a major finals but that would happen should the @entity17 tonight follow up @entity46 's win over the world champions			1
in that event , @entity5 would have a unique connection to the events , as a player and manager			2
any form of ' a result ' , he acknowledged last night would give the squad ' a massive lift ' ahead of the final qualifier of 2014 , away to @entity58 next month			1
@entity5 doffed a forelock to the four - time world champions , by insisting they would still top @entity62 comfortably			1
' they have a habit of qualifying , ' he observed			0
' i think @entity14 have had a history of roaring back pretty quickly from whatever setbacks they have			2
' @entity14 's @entity70 ( right ) attempts to get away from @entity18 's @entity71 in 1983 winger @entity72 celebrates scoring the first of his two goals against @entity27 it followed @entity77 's briefing earlier where he spoke casually about the 2016 finals as if he had already booked training grounds , hotels and put their poolside towels down in @entity82			1
being the efficient @entity1 , they probably have			0
@entity5 did n't disagree that the game carried echoes of his @entity87 duels against @entity38 's elite with @entity89			1
but he did n't tarry long over nostalgia			0
' this is n't @entity89			0
we 've got to perform			0
easy words , i know , but that 's what it will come down too , ' he said			0
a lthough they are unbeaten at home in 18 competitive games , if ever there was a good time to play @entity14 , tonight 's engagement is as opportune as any			1
rocked by retirements following their @entity110 triumph , and riddled by injuries to front - liners , there is indecision in the ranks following the unexpected loss to @entity46 where inefficiencies in front of goal cost them dear			2
@entity14 do n't lose qualifiers , and have never lost successive ones			1
@entity77 is demanding a response this evening — and there will be hell to pay if he does n't get one			2
@entity14 manager @entity77 kicks the ball back during his side 's defeat against @entity46 @entity46 players celebrate @entity131 's opening goal against the world champions in @entity133 @entity17 had the advantage of a light warm - up against @entity27 on saturday , where an overdue cavalcade of goals has injected a welcome wave of confidence			1
' if you said before the campaign started that we 'd be sitting here tonight with six points on the board , nine goals , you 'd have taken it , ' said @entity5 , who feels the @entity149 mind - set tonight will be similar but the ' approach ' to the game will differ			1
' we have a game plan which we hope can frustrate [ @entity14 ] and work to our advantage			1
that said , the best - laid plans can disappear			0
' if we sit in all day , they will pick you off			0
it 's a game to relish and one we want to go out and get something from			2
' @entity5 , who gave training in @entity160 a skip last night after a morning session in @entity163 , was keeping his cards close to his chest over his likely starting @entity166 he knows it but the players do n't and will be kept on their toes until a couple of hours before kick - off			1
prior to his hat - trick on saturday , @entity172 was vulnerable to sacrifice as the lone ranger in attack			0
but @entity172 has a presence about him and the @entity1 will be wary of his threat and reputation — they have n't forgotten his last - gasp equaliser in @entity181 in the 2002 @entity110			0
@entity172 fed off a @entity182 knock down that night and has never sparkled away from home as a sole striker			0
most recently , he was isolated against @entity185 , and was substituted			0
@entity14 goalkeeper @entity186 ( centre ) kicks the ball away in frustration after conceding to @entity46 springing him from the bench if @entity17 need a goal may be the most profitable way to use him for a more demanding contest such as this			1
@entity5 spoke of @entity172 in glowing terms last night , insisting he ' saw no reason ' to change his captain when he became manager and spoke of his ' excellent influence ' in the squad			2
pointedly , he warned against ' assuming ' that @entity172 would start			0
as for the @entity17 captain , who is usually chipper before game , he was strangely subdued — perhaps he is fearful of being told to bring a long coat to the game			2
' whenever the manager names the team , you 've got to respect his decision			0
my job is to score goals and i go into every game believing i can , ' he said			0
even so , changes are certain tonight with @entity215 and @entity216 pushing to start in central midfield after missing the @entity27 game			0
the back five should remain intact which will see @entity220 become the sixth @entity149 to complete a century of caps — an outstanding achievement for a model pro. ' the fact that @entity220 has been picked by so many different @entity149 managers tells you a lot about his qualities , ' said @entity5			2
a year ago , a makeshift @entity229 rolled into the @entity230 under @entity232 's interim management , and were unfortunate to lose 3 - 0 , while 12 months previous , @entity14 skittled @entity18 for six in @entity233			1
if any motivation spur was needed , those results should provide it			0
getting a result wo n't be easy , it never is against the @entity1 but @entity17 , even without @entity237 and @entity238 , have a couple of things going on their side			2
they have momentum , a rising self - belief , a striker on top form , and a manager who has never been intimidated by the reputation of @entity1 football			0
against the ' wounded animal ' of @entity14 , such dynamics could be sufficient to keep the @entity22 roadshow upright .			1

@entity14 host the @entity17 in a @entity22 qualifier
@entity77 's world champions lost to @entity46 in their last game
@entity5 helped @entity18 beat @entity14 in 1983
the @entity17 boss believes any result in @entity160 will give his team a huge boost ahead of their next qualifier with @entity58
