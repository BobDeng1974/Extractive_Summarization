without doubt the worst foul of the evening was by @entity3 ’s @entity2 on @entity4 and replays confirmed my initial thought that the over-the - top tackle should have meant the @entity10 side were reduced to 10 men			1
@entity13 referee @entity12 merely showed him a yellow card when a red one would have been the proper response			2
@entity12 was understanding and tolerant most of the time and as long as you like the game to be physical he was consistent			0
@entity3 's @entity2 was only booked following his studs up challenge on @entity22 's @entity4 @entity2 goes in with studs showing during @entity3 's @entity25 clash with @entity22 how was @entity26 not sent off for this ? the @entity29 midfielder went in with two feet against hazard but if there was anything @entity22 could object to in the referee ’s performance it was the continual fouling by former @entity22 player @entity36 , which went unpunished			1
while he could not be accused of making one really bad challenge , the number of offences he committed meant he should have been subject to disciplinary action			0
in fact , despite the physical nature of the match , which @entity12 was happy to allow most of the time , only four players were booked — two from each side			0
a stricter referee might have handled things very differently			0
@entity22 's @entity51 ( right ) appeals after he has his shirt pulled by @entity3 's @entity36 @entity36 escaped a booking during the game despite persistent fouling including this raised leg on @entity51 @entity22 's @entity57 reacts to a @entity36 trip by pushing the former @entity60 defender in the chest @entity22 's @entity62 ( left ) and @entity63 make their point to @entity36 during the 1 - 1 draw in the @entity66 @entity67 headed @entity22 in front in the first half with their only shot on target , before @entity72 nodded home an equaliser nine minutes after the break			1
some fine saves from @entity77 to deny @entity78 and @entity36 kept the @entity60 level , before @entity62 was fortunate not to concede a penalty late on after blatantly tripping @entity81 inside the @entity22 box .			2

@entity22 drew @entity25 last *16* clash at @entity3 1 - 1
@entity66 first leg clash saw @entity2 escape red card
@entity3 midfielder charged in with both feet raised on @entity60 ' @entity4
former @entity22 midfielder @entity36 also lucky not to be booked
