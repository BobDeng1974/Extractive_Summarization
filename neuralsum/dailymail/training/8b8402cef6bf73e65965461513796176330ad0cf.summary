@entity0 are yet to qualify for a major tournament			1
their record against @entity5 rivals @entity6 reads : played 21 , lost 17 , won 0			0
but the minnows upset the odds on monday night with a 2 - 0 win against @entity11 semi-finalists @entity12 , their first ever victory against the @entity12			1
@entity0 maintained their 100 per cent start to their @entity17 qualification campaign , and look destined to be in @entity18 in two years			1
@entity58 made the headlines in 1996 when he came on to play with his father , @entity60 , and is still the country 's poster boy			1
the current crop only include three players from the so called ' top ' leagues in @entity30 , @entity66 and @entity67 , but they reached the qualifying play - offs for the @entity69			1
unfortunately , @entity70 proved too strong but a new era for @entity73 football was born under joint head coaches @entity75 and @entity76			0
@entity0 have reached their highest world ranking of 34 , and have new stars to rival the the likes of @entity58 , who starred for @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 and former defender @entity84			2
@entity58 poses with father @entity60 ... the pair made history for featuring in same international game @entity58 is @entity0 's record goalscorer and still a poster boy ... but they are moving on with current crop @entity0 ( top left ) is cut adrift from the rest of @entity93 and has an even smaller population than @entity52 @entity95 ( 30 , @entity96 ) @entity97 ( 27 , @entity98 ) @entity99 ( 32 , @entity100 ) @entity101 ( 28 , @entity102 ) @entity103 ( 27 , @entity104 ) @entity67 ( 30 , @entity105 ) @entity30 ( 25 , @entity106 ) , @entity107 ( 25 , @entity45 ) @entity108 ( 26 , @entity109 ) @entity110 ( 22 , @entity111 ) @entity112 ( 24 , @entity113 ) @entity30 scored twice against the @entity36 , perhaps proving why @entity114 were wrong to let him go in the summer			1
the midfielder has a ratio of one goal every three games for his national side ( better than @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 achieved ) , and seems to enjoy being the big fish in a small ( frozen ) pond			0
more impressive though is the record of @entity112			0
the @entity113 striker has scored 16 times in 26 games for his country , and looks certain to beat @entity58 's total of 24			0
even @entity134 , boasting a population 175 times that of @entity0 , would be proud of their start in a group which also contains the @entity137 and @entity138 , while @entity139 ( pop. 80m ) and @entity141 ( pop. 146m ) have slipped up in qualifying so far			2
@entity112 has 16 goals in 26 international games and should beat @entity58 's record @entity30 has been a star for @entity106 this season and scored twice against the @entity36 @entity107 is the captain and one of the players based on these shores with @entity45 , along with @entity30 and @entity151 , of @entity100			1
the @entity73 fans applauded their team ( nicknamed ' our boys ' ) from start to finish against the @entity36 , despite having just 24 per cent of the ball during the game			0
even the @entity12 supporters clapped the minnows off the pitch			0
eight goals scored , none conceded , three wins out of three in @entity163 and the rest of @entity93 better watch out , @entity0 are on the march			0
@entity84 ( @entity114 , @entity81 ) , @entity58 ( @entity82 , @entity114 , @entity168 , @entity169 ) @entity170 ( @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 ) , @entity174 ( @entity175 ) , @entity176 ( @entity177 ) , @entity107 ( @entity45 ) , @entity178 ( @entity179 ) , @entity180 ( @entity81 , @entity181 ) , @entity182 ( @entity177 , @entity169 , @entity81 , @entity183 ) , @entity184 ( @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 ) , @entity190 ( @entity179 ) , @entity191 ( @entity172 ) , @entity192 ( @entity193 ) , @entity30 ( @entity106 , @entity114 , @entity106 ) , @entity194 ( @entity195 ) , @entity196 ( @entity81 ) .			2

@entity0 yet to qualify for a major tournament but look set to make @entity29
maintained 100 per cent start to qualifying with shock 2 - 0 win over @entity12
smaller population than @entity52 , @entity44 and @entity54
@entity58 is record scorer and poster boy but new crop *emerging*
@entity30 and @entity112 leading team now
