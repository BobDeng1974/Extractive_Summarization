@entity1 whistleblower @entity0 has made a surprise appearance as a speaker at the @entity5 conference in @entity7 , @entity8 , claiming that certain governments wanted him dead			1
@entity0 appeared on - stage via a screen alongside sir @entity11 , created with the invention of the @entity13 , who was putting forward his vision of a @entity16 for the internet that would enshrine the right to web freedom			1
" it is no mystery that there are governments out there that want to see me dead , " @entity0 told the conference			1
" i do n't want to harm any governments but they can not ignore due process			2
we need to encode our values in the structure of the @entity34			0
by engaging the people who rely on it every day we will get a better internet and build a better future than we can imagine			0
" " i am living proof that that an individual can go head - to - head with the most powerful intelligence agencies around the world and win			1
" his appearance follows a similar video link at the @entity48 ( @entity47 ) technology event in @entity50 , @entity51 , last month , and delivering the alternative @entity53 message on @entity54 last year			0
@entity55 : the mystic program is just the latest revelation revealed by former @entity1 contractor @entity0 the @entity5 ( @entity6 ) conference brings together speakers from around the world to share their ideas on how to improve and better understand the world			1
@entity0 also hinted during his address that there were more documents to be revealed about @entity67 , saying " some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come "			2
sir @entity11 , who was speaking as part of the celebrations to mark 25 years of the @entity13 , described @entity0 as a ‘ hero ’ and offered him a virtual high - five when he appeared on stage			1
the appearance comes on the heels of a claim by @entity0 that the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has been recording all of a foreign country 's phone calls , then listening to the conversations up to a month later			1
the program is the latest revelation from a trove of classified documents that @entity0 leaked to certain news organisations last year			2
@entity85 : the release by @entity0 of secret documents on @entity1 spying practices has become an enormous thorn in the heel of the spy agency most of those documents have described the @entity94 collecting massive amounts of data and @entity98 program is different in that it records phone calls			1
the @entity1 listening program was first reported by the @entity102 , which agreed to not identify the targeted country or other countries where the program 's use was envisioned by officials at the request of government officials			1
this @entity1 program dates to 2009 and is called mystic , according to documents obtained by the @entity102			2
it is used to intercept conversations in one specific country , but documents show the @entity1 intends to use it in other countries , the @entity102 said			0
the conversations swept up likely include those of @entity94 who make calls to or from the targeted country			0
civil libertarians are concerned that this program and others like it will target other countries and that the @entity1 will eventually hold the data longer than what was defined its original charter and use it for other reasons			0
the @entity129 would not comment on the specific program described by the @entity102			0
but @entity132 spokesman @entity131 said that information sought by the @entity94 intelligence community is , in many cases , hidden in the ' large and complex system ' of global communications sir @entity11 , who was speaking as part of the celebrations to mark 25 years of the @entity13 , described @entity0 ( on the tv screen ) as a ' hero ' ' the @entity94 must consequently collect signals intelligence in bulk in certain circumstances in order to identify these threats , ' @entity131 said in a statement			1
she said the presidential directive that authorises this type of collection ' makes clear that signals intelligence collected in bulk may only be used to meet specific security requirements '			0
the @entity1 is authorised to collect in bulk signals intelligence - the type of intelligence that comes from radio signals and communications , for example , as long as the purpose of the collection is to counter threats regarding espionage , terrorism , proliferation , cyber security , safety of @entity94 troops and transnational crime			2
bulk collection means collecting everything , even if some of what 's collected has nothing to do with national security			0
most of the conversations collected under the @entity1 program would be irrelevant , the @entity102 said			0
the @entity1 would not confirm the existence of the @entity181 program			0
but a spokesman said that the @entity1 's collection programs are legal and done for national security purposes			2
' @entity1 does not conduct signals intelligence collection in any country , or anywhere in the world , unless it is necessary to advance @entity94 national security and foreign policy interests and to protect its citizens and the citizens of its allies and partners from harm , ' @entity1 spokesman @entity185 said in an email			1
@entity185 said it jeopardises national security when details about classified intelligence programs are made public .			0
