by @entity0 with the sports luxe trend showing no sign of abating , designers have found a way of reinventing the style for another season			0
the likes of @entity9 and @entity10 are hot - footing a new trend for sporty fashion in the form of a high heeled trainer			1
but the trend for functional footwear has been given a more feminine makeover with the help of a few inches			0
would you wear them ? clearly giving the sports luxe trend an update , fashionistas in @entity41 are hoping the stiletto trainer will catch on celebrity stylist @entity45 helped shed some light on the trend : ' you could say that this bizarre design is just a continuation of the trend for wedged trainers			1
' @entity52 was the first to put the heel into the trainer and now @entity55 and high street brands have followed suit			2
' @entity58 described @entity9 as " a creative genius " but i am not so sure i agree , i think these are tacky , look extraordinarily uncomfortable and should be reserved for younger stars such as @entity63 and @entity64 who have the only chance of carrying this look off			1
' quirky : @entity9 and @entity10 already have some questionable footwear on offer @entity70 , @entity71 at @entity72 , added : ' @entity9 never fails to push the boundaries of cringeworthy with his garments			1
these are no exceptions to that rule			0
' the trend of adapted high heel trainers like this started years ago with counterfeit @entity81 pairs			2
' they are ugly as sin and this is exactly what @entity9 thrives on for his ever eccentric , yet pop - cultured , shock factor			1
' remember these ? @entity87 gave heeled boots a spin a few years ago and they did n't exactly catch on continuing the theme for giving a hint of height to an otherwise usually flat shoe @entity95 models wore wellies with a sturdy looking heel on the catwalk today			0
the transparent shoes came in green and blue versions and were shown as part of the designers ready to wear fall / winter 2014 - 2015 collection			0
the models at @entity95 strutted their stuff in heeled wellies			0

@entity9 and @entity10 have created bright high - heeled trainers
@entity16 *spotted* wearing them in @entity41
stylist @entity45 said they look ' tacky and uncomfortable '
