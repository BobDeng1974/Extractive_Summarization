the 298 victims on board tragic flight @entity2 would have been killed instantly or remained conscious for only a few seconds after the plane was struck down by a missile , an @entity1 expert has claimed			1
forensic scientist @entity7 , from the @entity8 , told the @entity9 that it 's ' very unlikely the passengers would have suffered ' when the @entity12 @entity11 777 - 200 was shot down by @entity14 rebels in @entity15			1
as investigators continue to piece together what happened , professor @entity7 ' analysis offers some comfort to the families of the victims , including 37 @entity1 , who he says would have had ' no time to worry '			1
professor @entity32 says dramatic and immediate drops in temperature and cabin pressure would have rendered them unconscious @entity7 ( right ) , who led investigations in the @entity39 bombing , says passengers would not have suffered professor @entity41 , who led forensic investigations into the @entity39 bombings , says that an explosion would have triggered a chain reaction that would have ' rendered the passengers unconscious within seconds ' - including dramatic and instant drops in air pressure and temperature and a loss of oxygen			1
it comes as victims ' bodies were transported via train to eastern @entity15 , but families were concerned that the painstaking identification process could take months			1
an @entity1 air force plane and refrigerated trucks have arrived in @entity59 but @entity15 says there were only 200 recovered from the crash site			1
experts are also concerned that readings from @entity2 's black boxes may reveal nothing about the attack , rendering them virtually useless to investigators			1
and while photos have emerged showing damage to the front panels from the doomed airline point , which may be conclusive evidence of a missile strike , professor @entity41 says the victims ' bodies themselves may provide ' trace evidence of shrapnel wounds '			1
photographs show pieces of the @entity80 have tiny holes indicating small pieces of shrapnel entered the aircraft externally , it has been reported			2
a piece of wreckage from @entity87 17 , in a field near @entity89 in the eastern @entity15 , several miles from the largest concentration of debris according to analysts , the perforation holes visible on the debris are consistent with high - velocity shrapnel from fragmenting warheads like the @entity100 " missiles @entity99 officials have said likely brought down the plane experts have warned that the ' black boxes ' from @entity2 may yield nothing about the attack , rendering them virtually useless to investigators @entity106 , a defense analyst , told the @entity107 that the two likely causes were an engine explosion or an exploding missile			1
according to mr @entity106 , the @entity100 missiles intercept targeted aircraft before exploding near it creating a cloud of shrapnel			2
an sa - 11 missile carries about 46 pounds of explosives and detonates about 100 to 300 feet away from the target			2
meanwhile prime minister @entity119 said @entity120 - to bring the 37 @entity1 victims back - would be headed up by former defence chief @entity122 , who also coordinated @entity1 search efforts for @entity124			1
the refrigerated train carrying the dead has arrived in @entity127 - in @entity15 's east - where @entity1 and @entity129 representatives will prepare them for transport to the @entity129 for the identification process			1
a @entity132 of the @entity1 @entity133 stands at the @entity134 in @entity129			1
the aircraft will , together with aircrafts of the @entity136 , repatriate from @entity127 to @entity138 the bodies of the victims mr @entity119 also wrote in the condolence book for the plane crash victims on tuesday at @entity143 carriages of death : a train carrying the remains victims of the @entity12 @entity2 disaster arrives in the @entity15 government - held city of @entity127 journalists follow the train as it arrives in the city of @entity127 , where the victims will be flown to the @entity129 the transportation and identification process in @entity15 and the @entity129 will involve consular officers , @entity159 experts and air safety investigators			1
despite tuesday 's progress , mr @entity119 warned there was ' still a long , long way to go '			2
' after the crime comes the cover - up , ' he told reporters in @entity167 on tuesday			2
' what we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale , and obviously that has to stop			0
' mr @entity119 said he understood the families ' frustration at the lengthy process , but it was something that needed to be done			0
' i need to caution that this is necessarily a painstaking and methodical process that will take some weeks , ' he said			0
the train arrived in @entity127 on tuesday night , carrying the bodies of @entity2 victims from the crash site the bodies will be flown to the @entity129 from @entity127 to be formally identified by forensic and identification experts @entity120 started just hours after foreign minister @entity187 helped secure a unanimous vote in the @entity190 @entity189 to allow ' safe , secure , full and unrestricted access ' to the @entity12 crash site for international investigators in a move to find out who is responsible for the tragedy			1
' there must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site , ' ms @entity187 told the @entity189			0
' the victims must be treated with dignity , brought back to their homes and laid to rest			2
' all parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts			0
' @entity206 must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this			0
@entity206 must also use its influence to bring the conflict in @entity15 to an end			0
' @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 - aged 12 , eight and 10 - were among the @entity1 victims @entity218 ( left ) and @entity219 ( right ) were another two victims of the @entity2 crash mr @entity119 's formal message of condolence to the victims ' families on behalf of the nation pro-russian separatists - who stand accused of bringing down the aircraft , possibly with a missile supplied by @entity231 - bowed to a furious clamour for the bodies and black boxes to be handed to investigators five days after the crash			1
mr @entity236 said the boxes were handed over to the @entity239 team in @entity240 at 9pm @entity15 time on monday			0
the small handing over ceremony has finally solved the question as to what had happened to the two vital devices			0
mr @entity236 revealed that in recent days the team had been working quietly behind the scenes to establish contact with ' those ' - a reference to the rebels - in charge of the @entity2 crash site			1
the contact was finally made - but he made it clear it had not been easy			0
' under difficult and fluid circumstances , we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all - securing vital evidence from the aircraft , launching an independent investigation and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives			0
' the prime minister said that in another breakthrough an independent international investigation team would be guaranteed safe access to the crash site			2
' i must stress that although agreement has been reached , there remain a number of steps required before it is completed , ' mr @entity236 said			0
tragic : a toy is placed at the crash site of @entity277 near the village of @entity279 , eastern @entity15 @entity281 foreign secretary @entity280 said all the evidence currently available indicates that the surface - to - air missile which destroyed the @entity2 was supplied by @entity206 ' there is work still to be done , work which relies on continued communication in good faith			1
[ @entity288 leader ] mr @entity288 and his people have so far given their co-operation			0
' i ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this agreement is honoured ; that the remains of our people are returned , that the black box is handed over , and that the international team is granted full access to the site			2
' only then can the investigation into @entity2 truly begin ; only then can the victims be afforded the respect they deserve			1
we need to know what caused the plane to crash , and who was responsible for it , so that justice may be done			0
' in recent days , there were times i wanted to give greater voice to the anger and grief that the @entity239 people feel			0
but sometimes , we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome			0
' i understand that for the families , nothing can undo this damage			0
the lives taken can not be given back ; the dignity lost can not be regained			0
' my heart reaches out to those whose loved ones were lost on @entity2			2
we hope and pray that the agreement reached tonight helps bring them a clear step towards closure			0

expert says @entity2 passengers would likely ' not have suffered '
forensic scientist @entity7 says drops in temperature and air pressure would have knocked out the passengers when the missile hit

@entity1 and @entity129 representatives will then send them onto the @entity129
