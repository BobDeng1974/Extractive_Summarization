on a remote island in the @entity2 , researchers have spotted fur seals sexually harassing and coercing king penguins			1
on at least four occasions , the large mammals have been recorded forcing the birds to the ground and attempting to mate with them			0
after three of the incidents , the seals let the penguins go - but following one attack , the seal killed the penguin and ate it			1
this article contains images and video that some readers may find disturbing on four recent occasions , researchers spotted @entity23 fur seals sexually harassing king penguins ( pictured )			1
in three of the four incidents , the seal let the penguin go , but following one occurrence , the seal killed and ate the penguin scientists from the @entity32 regularly monitor wildlife on @entity34 for rare and unusual behaviour			1
although the behaviour has been spotted once before , in 2006 , this recent spate suggests the acts are becoming more widespread			0
each of the four recorded sexual incidents showed the seal chasing , capturing and mounting the penguins			2
they then attempted to copulate for between two - and - a - half minutes and six minutes , before they are seen resting and trying again			0
the average copulation time was five minutes			0
experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour , because the incidents have occurred with different fur seals			1
and the incidents may continue , but the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit this behaviour are not known			1
the researchers speculated that the seals may be sexually inexperienced , or frustrated , or it may be an act of aggression			2
they may also have difficulty recognising female seal partners			0
‘ honestly i did not expect that follow up sightings of a similar nature to that 2006 one would ever be made again , and certainly not on multiple occasions , ’ @entity61 , of the @entity62 at the @entity32 , @entity60 told the @entity63			0
each of the four recorded sexual incidents showed the seal chasing , capturing and mounting the penguins			2
they then attempted to copulate for between two - and - a - half minutes and six minutes at a time , before they are seen resting and trying again			0
the average copulation time was five minutes			0
the seals were all male , but the gender of the penguins is n’t known			2
experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour , because the incidents have occurred with different fur seals			1
and the incidents may continue - but the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit this behaviour are not known			1
' determining the drivers of the unusual behaviour is nearly impossible , ' explained the researchers			1
' however , we speculate as to what may have ultimately led to the sexual coercion of individuals from these very different species			0
' for example , mr @entity92 originally suggested the sexual coercion was a result of the seal 's predatory behaviour towards the penguins being redirected into sexual arousal			2
experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour , but , the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit it are not known			1
during a number of the attacks , the experts said the seals successfully penetrated the birds , and during the most recent , in december 2012 , blood was seen between the bird ’s legs ( bottom left ) but , in light of the 2011 attack - when the seal killed the penguin - he added that this seems less plausible			1
he therefore believes the behaviour may have been learned the researchers have speculated that the seals may also be sexually inexperienced , or frustrated , or it may be an act of aggression			1
they may also have difficulty recognising female seal partners			0
scientists from the @entity32 monitor wildlife on @entity130 ( marked ) for rare and unusual behaviour			1
in 2006 , the incident was spotted on @entity134 beach			0
the most recent occurrences took place on @entity137 and @entity139 beach during a number of the attacks , the researchers said the seals successfully penetrated the birds , and during the most recent - in december 2012 - blood was seen between the bird ’s legs			2
in 2006 , the incident was spotted on @entity134 beach			0
the most recent occurrences took place on @entity137 and @entity139 beach			0
the findings are published in the @entity152 journal @entity153 .			0
