@entity0 scored his first @entity1 try for @entity2 as the title contenders brushed off @entity5 visitors @entity4 in bonus point fashion			1
former rugby league star @entity0 struck 45 minutes into the contest , which highlighted his most effective performance since he entered the union code as a second - half substitute against @entity12 six weeks ago			1
the high - profile union convert proved a prominent figure in attack and defence as @entity2 triumphed 39 - 26 on the back of further tries from flanker @entity19 , wings @entity20 and @entity22 , plus substitute @entity23 , while fly - half @entity24 kicked 14 points			1
@entity0 celebrates his first @entity1 try for @entity2 in their win over @entity4 @entity0 crosses in the 45th minute as second - placed @entity2 triumph 39 - 26 over the play - off hopefuls @entity0 gave his most complete performance in rugby union to date in attack and defence @entity0 shows a left - handed fend that made him such a menace for rugby league defences before his switch play - off challengers @entity4 collected a losing bonus point , which had looked unlikely when they trailed 39 - 12			1
late scores by @entity41 and @entity42 added to earlier touchdowns from @entity44 and number eight @entity45 , while @entity42 booted two conversions and @entity49 one			0
@entity2 's latest league win meant they moved just one point behind leaders @entity53 following @entity55 ' 20 - 7 loss against @entity56 on saturday			1
and it gave them just the lift they required after last sunday 's defeat at @entity62 before resuming @entity64 business with a crunch pool clash in @entity66 next weekend			0
@entity2 showed a number of changes from the side beaten by @entity62 at @entity70 six days ago , including starts for centre @entity72 , prop @entity74 and number eight @entity75			0
@entity20 ( left ) speeds away from @entity4 ' @entity77 to run in @entity2 's opening try at @entity5 @entity20 's fellow winger also got on the board with this try which @entity82 could n't prevent wasps were forced into a late switch when wing @entity85 was sidelined by a strained hamstring , so @entity77 was promoted to the starting line - up			2
@entity0 was prominent during the initial flurries , twice making ground in midfield as the home side looked to start strongly against opponents who had moved impressively into play - off contention			0
@entity0 also shone through a couple of crunching early tackles , announcing his presence in no uncertain terms just three weeks before a possible run - out for @entity100 against @entity101 in @entity102			2
and @entity2 's momentum was rewarded after 11 minutes when they breached @entity4 ' defence following sustained pressure , with @entity19 bouncing off a would - be tackler and touching down bethween the posts for a try that @entity24 converted			1
@entity4 ' early problems were not helped by flanker @entity109 going off injured - he was replaced by @entity110 - and @entity2 continued to dominate the territorial battle , helped chiefly by centre @entity72 's creativity			2
@entity100 fly - half @entity24 kicked 14 points as @entity2 went within one point of the @entity1 lead @entity2 secure an uncontested line - out in their high - scoring victory over @entity4 on saturday but @entity4 pounced from their first notable attack after @entity41 ' strong midfield run left the @entity2 defence in disarray , and he linked impressively with @entity45 , who delivered a scoring pass to @entity125			1
it was a wake - up call for the home side , yet they responded through a @entity129 penalty 12 minutes before half - time , and then delivered a stunning try from deep inside their own half			0
turnover possession found its way to full - back @entity135 , whose angled run stretched @entity4 , and then @entity129 sent @entity20 sprinting away on a 50 - metre break			0
@entity20 just made it to the line , appearing to suffer a hamstring injury as he neared @entity4 ' line			0
@entity24 converted , but the @entity100 wing was then forced off and @entity144 took over from him as the interval approached			0
@entity146 scored the first of @entity4 ' four tries to earn the now @entity151 based side a losing bonus point @entity4 could not establish any momentum following @entity44 's try and a second @entity129 penalty opened up a 15 - point advantage at the break , leaving @entity2 firmly in charge of the contest			1
@entity2 were in no mood to take their foot off the accelerator immediately after half - time , and more sustained pressure resulted in the impressive @entity129 sending @entity0 over from close range			2
@entity45 replied with a try for @entity4 shortly afterwards , yet @entity2 were not to be diverted from their quest for a five - point maximum , which arrived midway through the second period through a trademark power - packed @entity170 score			2
wasps just could not cope with wave after wave of @entity2 attacks , and @entity23 added another touchdown - @entity129 converted from the touchline - but the visitors finished strongly through tries @entity41 and @entity42 that said a great deal about their character .			0
