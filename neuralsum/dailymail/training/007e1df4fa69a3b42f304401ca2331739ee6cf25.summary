at the age of 81 , sir @entity0 says he 's ready to retire from acting from @entity3 to the @entity5 job and @entity6 , he has starred in some of @entity8 ’s most famous films			1
but at the age of 81 , it seems sir @entity0 may be ready to call it a day			1
the actor has revealed he has ‘ probably retired ’ and will not make another film unless he is sent a script he can not refuse			2
speaking to @entity16 ’s @entity15 , sir @entity0 said his latest film @entity18 , in which he stars alongside @entity19 and @entity20 , is likely to be his last			1
he said : ‘ i have no ambitions now … all i do is , i do films that i really want to do			0
‘ if i do n’t get a script – which i do n’t have – that entices me out , i ’ll be done in december when i do the last picture , the last script i ’ve got			0
‘ i always went into every movie with an aim			0
it was either to get an @entity29 or make money , that ’s the two reasons i do movies			1
i ’ve got two @entity29 and i ’ve got some money so i ’m alright			2
’ at a charity night at the @entity35 to honour his long career , sir @entity0 dropped further hints that his film days may be over , saying : ‘ i ’ve probably retired now but i go home and there will be a great script and i think ‘ oh i ’ll do one more ’			1
i look to see if it challenges me			0
’ sir @entity0 first shot to fame in 1964 ’s @entity3 , in which he had to mask his @entity47 accent to play an upper class @entity8 officer			1
recalling the moment he was cast , he said : ‘ i was due to play the cockney corporal but they said can you do a posh accent ? the funny thing with the @entity57 class system is i bet an @entity57 director would n’t have given me that part but being @entity60 he did n’t know the system			0
‘ they said to me : “ i ’ve seen you a lot on screen now and you look gay - to @entity60 , @entity57 officers look gay			0
” but it was funny because then i got nominated for an @entity29 for @entity69 who was screwing every woman who could			2
’ sir @entity0 in a scene from @entity73 , 1969			1
the actor 's latest film , @entity18 , will probably be his last @entity0 as an upper - class @entity8 officer in @entity3 ( left ) and @entity77 in @entity73 ( right ) @entity0 shooting scenes for his new movie @entity18 alongside scantily - clad @entity82 model @entity80 since then , sir @entity0 has appeared in more than 100 films and won two @entity29 , a @entity84 and a @entity85			1
in some of his best remembered roles he has played criminals and gangsters , such as in @entity73 and @entity6			2
he enjoyed a career resurgence in the 1990s after having practically retired from acting , and has been nominated for an @entity29 in every decade since the 1960s			2
however , sir @entity0 said he was uncomfortable with being labelled a national treasure			1
he said : ‘ you do n’t know what to do when you ’re a @entity93 you do n’t have a special restaurant you can go to called @entity95 you do n’t do a course in it , i just live my life			0
’ he added : ‘ i did n’t set out to be a movie star or rich and famous that would have been a stupid idea for a @entity47 boy			0
i set out to be the best actor i could ever be			0
i never get television scripts , i get so many movie scripts , i love movies			0
