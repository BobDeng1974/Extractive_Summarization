a tv producer lost full custody of her biological daughter after the judge ruled her lesbian lover was the more responsible parent - the first case of its kind in @entity9 involving a same - sex couple			1
a @entity12 judge ruled against @entity15 - winning tv producer @entity13 , from @entity9 , in favor of the six - year - old 's adoptive mother @entity17			1
in october 2006 , @entity13 gave birth to the lesbian couple 's baby daughter after a sperm donation from @entity17 's close friend @entity23			1
lesbian lovers : @entity13 , left , and @entity17 , had been together four years when they decided to have a child together with a sperm donation from a friend custody : @entity29 real estate attorney @entity17 , right , defeated the little girl 's biological mom , @entity15 - winning tv producer @entity13 , left , in a bitter court battle the now - estranged couple had been together four years and were living together at the time after meeting on a blind date			1
frame renounced his parental rights and @entity17 , who is a @entity29 real estate attorney , legally adopted the baby girl			0
but tension arose when @entity23 insisted he had a say in the raising of the child and the biological parents often took each other 's side and alienated @entity17 , according to the @entity45			2
after the couple eventually split in 2010 , @entity13 fled to @entity47 with their daughter			1
scollar sought - and was immediately granted - temporary custody of the child by a @entity9 judge , and @entity13 was ordered to return			2
after that , what had started out as an acrimonious split soon turned ugly			0

and the minute i saw this little baby , i knew she was mine ' @entity13 herself later admitted that ' she did not believe the child was sexually abused ' but insisted she had a ' ball ' and a ' blast ' at the examination , according to the @entity45			2
in the ruling , the judge said the biology of the child was irrelevant and that @entity17 was ' indeed the more responsible parent looking out for the child ’s best interests , not her own interests '			1
she added that @entity13 , a former producer for @entity85 ’s tv show , ' behaved more as a friend or older sister than a responsible parent			2
' she noted that @entity17 had the child on a schedule , always brought her to school on time and to therapy appointments			0
@entity13 , on the other hand was a ' freer spirit ' and a ' more laid - back parent ' who would ' miss therapy appointments or be late to school or camp bus because she overslept or felt that play dates were more important than therapy or that play dates should end late in the evening so that the child and she were too tired to commit to a schedule			0
' @entity17 told the @entity45 days after she was awarded custody : ' @entity68 does n’t just come from biology			0
and the minute i saw this little baby , i knew she was mine			0
