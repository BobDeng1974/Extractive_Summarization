@entity0 scored @entity2 's opener - click here for that and more from our @entity5 a few early - season narratives got ripped to shreds at @entity8 , as @entity0 showed his class , @entity2 displayed their steel , and @entity12 ’s stout defence was breached three times in a devastating spell of 200 seconds			1
the scoreline shows a chasm between these teams when in reality the match was much closer , but @entity21 ’s side ruthlessly exploited their openings to prove a defeat to @entity24 should not completely colour opinions			0
wenger has been forced to defend his record purchase @entity0 at various points since his £ 42.5million transfer from @entity30 but none more so than in the aftermath to the @entity34 ’s limp performance in the @entity35			2
@entity0 evades @entity36 to latch on to @entity38 's pass and score @entity2 's opening goal against @entity12 @entity38 adds to @entity2 's lead a minute later , tapping the ball past @entity12 goalkeeper @entity42 from close range for his first @entity45 goal @entity46 ( left ) scores an own goal to make it 3 - 0 to @entity2 in the space of four minutes @entity12 4 - 3 - 3 : @entity42 6 ; @entity50 6.5 , @entity36 6 , @entity51 6 , @entity46 6 ; @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 6 ( @entity54 86min ) , @entity55 7 ; @entity56 6 ( @entity57 46 , 6 ) , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 6 ( @entity60 77 ) booked : @entity51 subs not used : given , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64			1
manager : @entity66 6 @entity2 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 : @entity67 7 ; @entity68 6.5 , mertesacker 7 , @entity69 7 , @entity70 7 ; @entity71 6.5 , @entity72 7 ( @entity73 78 ) ; @entity74 7 ( @entity75 78 ) , @entity0 8 , @entity76 7 ; @entity38 7.5 ( @entity77 78 ) booked : @entity68 , @entity72 , @entity73 subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity53 , @entity81 manager : @entity21 7			1
man of the match : @entity0			2
referee : @entity86 6 attendance : 40,013 @entity0 has been played on the left to limited effect but at @entity8 he was given the vital no 10 role behind @entity38			1
@entity53 never made it off the bench and @entity72 was deployed alongside @entity71			0
for half an hour @entity0 was on the fringes of this game ; dropping deep to pick up the ball , providing links to attacks that lacked potency as @entity12 appeared the more threatening team			2
but as the clock struck 32 minutes he altered the complexion of this match and perhaps how he is viewed by pundits and supporters alike			0
escaping his marker and running beyond @entity36 he collected a smart through ball from @entity38 and stroked a finish past @entity42 with the composure of someone born to do it			1
one minute and 20 seconds later he exhibited the creative aspect of his game to hand @entity38 his first @entity2 goal on a plate			1
the @entity116 striker fed @entity0 on the left and his cross to the six - yard box was so precise it allowed @entity38 to sprint on to it and drive a shot into the roof of the net without breaking stride			1
it was his first club goal since netting for @entity127 at @entity128 in march			0
more than 40,000 had turned up off the back of an unbeaten start to this campaign that saw @entity66 ’s team start this match in second place in the @entity135			0
they had kept @entity137 to one shot on target at @entity140 and conceded only once in four league games			0
but soon after they had let in three goals in three minutes and 20 seconds			0
@entity70 was allowed too much space on the left and his devilish ball was diverted into his own net by @entity46 with @entity74 lurking behind			2
a virus had rendered @entity66 without @entity149 shortly before kick - off , as well as @entity151 , who was replaced by @entity51 in central defence alongside @entity36			0
@entity12 captain @entity58 hurdles a challenge from @entity154 in the opening minutes at @entity8 @entity38 ( centre ) produces an acrobatic effort on goal as @entity12 defenders @entity50 ( right ) and @entity159 to block the ball @entity0 sets himself and holds off @entity36 to slot his first goal of the season past @entity42 @entity0 looks like he means business as he celebrates his opening goal for @entity2 @entity0 ( right ) is congratulated by team - mates @entity38 ( second right ) , @entity70 ( second left ) and @entity72 @entity0 's heat map after he played the ' no 10 ' role showed he played all across the pitch just behind the striker ... for more go to our brilliant @entity5 for the opening 30 minutes those absences had not looked like hampering @entity12 , who began with purpose and energy , twice bringing fine saves from @entity67			1
within three minutes of the start the @entity180 goalkeeper ’s poor kick was seized upon by @entity55 , who exchanged a one - two with @entity56 on the edge of the @entity2 area and struck a well - placed shot to the corner of the goal			2
but @entity67 dived to push round the post			0
not long before @entity2 won this game , @entity51 had an excellent opportunity to hand his team the lead			0
@entity52 swung over a deep free - kick and the defender had space at the back post to head home but a star jump save from @entity67 came to @entity2 's rescue again			1
that was to be as good as it got for @entity12 , who found out , like most of us , @entity2 are a better team than a bad night in @entity24 would have us believe			0
a view from behind as @entity38 steers home @entity2 's second from close range via @entity42 's face @entity38 takes the congratulations from @entity68 ( centre ) , @entity76 ( left ) and @entity72 ( right , partly obscured ) after his goal @entity38 scored his first goal for @entity2 from close range after a nice move down the left ... for more go to our brilliant @entity5 @entity70 ( right ) fires in the shot which led to @entity46 's own goal and @entity2 's third @entity36 ( centre ) tries to encourage @entity12 's shell - shocked players after @entity46 's own goal made it 3 - 0 @entity12 midfielder @entity221 puts in a hefty challenge on @entity38 as the hosts look to stem the tide @entity55 takes the ball past @entity116 colleague @entity74 in the midfield @entity74 runs at @entity46 on a torrid afternoon for the @entity12 left back , who was taken off at half - time @entity68 ( right ) wins a header against @entity51 ( second right ) as @entity2 clear a dead ball @entity72 and @entity52 vie for the ball during a more keenly - contested second half @entity72 contraols the ball in midfield with @entity2 in a comfortable position at @entity8 @entity236 cuts a menacing figure with his foot on the ball as @entity68 looks to get the game restarted quickly @entity21 is given a pre-match hug by @entity12 's mascot and it seems the hosts ' players were equally generous			1

@entity0 slots @entity2 's first goal past @entity42 from @entity38 's pass
@entity0 sets up @entity38 60 seconds later for @entity116 striker 's first goal for @entity2
