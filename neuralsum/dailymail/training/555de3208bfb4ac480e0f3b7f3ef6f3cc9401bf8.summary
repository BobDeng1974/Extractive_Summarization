@entity0 once famously warned of the potential of @entity3 embarrassing politicians			2
but in an extraordinary online blunder , the prime minister ’s official account has managed to offend the victims of the terror attack in @entity9 , survivors of the @entity12 bombing and foreign secretary @entity13			1
a tweet , which claims an image of @entity16 being lifted from the @entity12 bomb wreckage looked like he was enjoying sex , was apparently ticked as a ‘ favourite ’ by mr @entity0			1
blunder : @entity0 's official account listed just one tweet as a ' favourite ' - from an account which suggests a photo of @entity16 being lifted from the wreckage of the @entity12 bomb looks like he is enjoying sex aftermath : @entity16 is treated after the @entity32 bombing at the @entity33 in @entity12 @entity34 struggled to explain the blunder , which came after the pm used the site to pay his respects to the people of @entity9 after armed terrorists stormed a @entity42 shopping centre			1
the prime minister , who once warned ' too many tweets might make a tw * t ' , wrote that he gave his ‘ condolences to president @entity48 after the attack on the # westgate shopping centre ’ and revealed mr @entity13 would give a statement			1
the tweet received dozens of responses , including one from a spoof account named @ @entity54 , although the @entity56 mp has not connection with the account			2
it read : ‘ @ @entity60 please call off @ @entity61 , has n’t @entity9 suffered enough today ? ’ to add to the sense of revulsion , the account uses an image of @entity16 being lifted from the wreckage of the @entity12 bombing in 1984 , in which five people died and his wife was left disabled			1
the revolting name of the account suggests the picture of @entity16 was taken while having sex			1
rescue mission : an image from @entity77 shows military forces taking position inside the shopping mall @entity16 today called for @entity0 to be removed as @entity56 leader			2
in criticism unrelated to the @entity3 blunder , the former @entity56 chairman accused mr @entity0 of failing to take the threat of @entity86 seriously			0
he claimed mr @entity0 's modernisation programme had driven @entity56 voters away			0
he told @entity89 : ' i think we have to take @entity86 seriously because so many @entity93 voters are attracted to it			2
' if i took over a shop in the high street which used to have a lot of customers , and found that the customers were going past my shop and going down the road to a competitor , i would n’t do what @entity102 has advised which is to stand in the street abusing one ’s ex-customers in the hope that that will bring them back into your shop			0
' i ’d go and see what the other guy was selling , and if i found out it was pretty well what i used to sell in my shop , i think i ’d fire the purchasing manager of the shop and get some goods back in that attracted the people in			0
' and that ’s what the @entity56 party ’s got to do - we ’ve got to take seriously why people are attracted to @entity86			0
' someone monitoring mr @entity0 ’s account then pressed the ‘ favourite ’ button , making it the only tweet to be singled out in this way by the prime minister since he joined @entity3 a year ago			1
@entity34 last night said it had been a ‘ mistake ’ , but was unable to say whether the error had been made by mr @entity0 himself or one of his officials			0
@entity16 , one of the stars of @entity139 ’s @entity138 , was badly injured in the @entity12 attack , which killed five and injured dozens			0
his wife @entity142 was left permanently disabled and he later stepped down from frontline politics to care for her			0
the bombing , which took place during the @entity56 conference , was a deliberate attempt to assassinate the @entity138			0
in the last year mr @entity0 has built up more than 450,000 followers , but has been bombarded by abuse			1
a @entity151 source said : ‘ this is highly offensive to both the victims of the @entity9 attack and the @entity12 bomb			1
’ to add to the insensitivity of the @entity56 error , it emerged just hours before it was announced that at least three @entity159 were among those killed in @entity9			1
sources said mr @entity0 ’s account is used by the prime minister himself			1
but senior officials also have access to it on his behalf			0
a spokesman said : ‘ this is a deeply offensive account that the prime minister would never want to be associated with			1
‘ clearly the @entity3 was favourited by mistake and was removed as soon as it was realised			0
’ its not the first time that @entity3 has left mr @entity0 red - faced			0
in july he blundered when he apparently confused a cabinet minister with a spoof @entity3 account			1
the prime minister wrote : ' we 're rolling out a cap on benefits today - @ @entity180 and i are determined to make work pay			1
' but @ @entity183 is not @entity185 @entity184 but a parody @entity3 account mocking the minister			2
the clues that the @ @entity180 account was not real were there			2
the account biography includes ' parodia ' and the phrase ' chin chin old bean '			2
previous tweets included : ' i 've always supported a @entity199			0
your tax buys my mansion			0
