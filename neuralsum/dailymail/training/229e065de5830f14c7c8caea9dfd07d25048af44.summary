a 72 - year - old @entity1 woman has described for the first time how she was held prisoner in the early 1960s as a young bride in an @entity6 harem			1
in a new book , ' an @entity9 bride in @entity10 ' released early next month , @entity7 writes about five months she spent in the @entity13 country , and how she almost died before she managed to escape and annul her ill - fated marriage			1
@entity7 was 18 when she fell in love with a handsome older @entity6 man who she met when the pair were studying together at @entity19			1
after dating for two years , @entity7 told @entity20 she wanted to travel but her boyfriend insisted they must be married before they could embark on their adventures			1
against her outraged parents ' wishes , @entity7 wed her @entity13 prince at a civil ceremony in @entity29 with no family present			1
interesting life : @entity7 , pictured in 1972 , spent five months in a compound in @entity6 they traveled to @entity34 for their honeymoon with a plan to stop off in @entity10 to meet his family			1
' i did not know that this would be our final destination , ' she writes in an exert of the book in the @entity44 , explaining that 30 relatives awaited the newlyweds as they landed in the @entity6 capital			1
among them , there was not one but three mothers - in - law , @entity7 recalls			2
she was too shocked to speak , and wondered what this meant for her own future as a wife of an @entity6 man			1
the family was warm and inviting so she tried to forget her husband 's starling omission -- until an airport official demanded that she turn over her @entity9 passport			1
both the official and my husband assure me that this is a mere formality , ' she writes			2
' it will soon be returned to me , so i reluctantly relinquish it			0
i will never see my passport again			2
' her lack of passport meant she would not be able to leave @entity6 at will			1
' i am now subject to the laws and custom of @entity6 , and as a @entity6 woman , that means hardly any rights at all , ' she writes			1
former life : in her new book , ' an @entity9 bride in @entity10 ' released early next month , @entity7 , pictured left and right , writes her harrowing experience in @entity10 she was taken to her rich father - in - law 's spacious compound -- where the patriarch , his three wives , 21 children - ranging from infancy to their 30s - two grandchildren , at least one son - in - law , one daughter - in - law and an unknown number of servants and relatives lived in a number of luxury two - story @entity34 - style houses , with patios , indoor gardens , and verandas			1
' this is my new home			0
my harem , ' she explains in the book			2
the family went out of their way to impress @entity7 when she arrived and the couple was welcomed with a feast of ' unending and delicious dishes ' cooked without the traditional ghee , a clarified butter that often makes foreigners ill because their stomachs are not used to it			1
@entity119 came alive during the celebration , she recalls , speaking @entity121 , which she herself could not speak , and leaving her alone with the other women			2
despite having never prayed at home , her husband , like all the other men , suddenly dropped to the floor on all fours to profess his devotion to @entity130			2
she said from that point on she was left almost constantly alone or with her biological mother - in - law and female relatives			0
the special treatment quickly stopped and soon all her meals were being made with ghee , making her so sick she stopped eating them			2
she instead horded canned food but this was later confiscated			0
compelling : @entity7 's story , pictured , is released early next month she was not allowed to leave the compound without an entourage of people guarding her -- as such , she left just twice in her first two weeks and five or six times in total			1
' i have no freedom at all , ' she wrote in her journal at the time			0
' no opportunity to meet anyone or go anywhere			0
his family watches me suspiciously			2
am i getting paranoid ? ' her mother - in - law then stopped boiling her drinking water and she immediately contracted dysentery			0
' perhaps she thinks i am already ' @entity6 enough ' to withstand any and all germs			2
perhaps she wants me dead , ' she writes			0
she explains her mother - in - law then attempted to convert her to @entity161 , giving her prayer rugs and prayer beads			0
she feared that if she did n't convert , her mother - in - law may sickened her further or even kill her			0
passport : @entity7 , pictured , had her passport confiscated when she touched down in @entity10 with her new husband but converting to @entity161 still was n't enough			1
her mother - in - law would spit at her and call her " @entity167 " or " jew " when she became angry			0
when she told her husband , he said she was being dramatic			2
at that point , she realized she had to escape			0
she tried three times to get to the @entity9 embassy , hoping her country would protect her and help her get home			1
but without a @entity9 passport , she no longer had any rights as an @entity9			1
meanwhile , @entity119 had become short - tempered			0
' he has begun to hit me , ' she wrote in her journal at the time			0
' had i known something like this could ever happen , had i known that we would have to live with his mother and brothers , i would never have come here			0
' her efforts to leave were scuppered when she became seriously ill. after days of struggling with her unsympathetic family , they called a local doctor who diagnosed her with hepatitis			0
she begged to see an @entity9 doctor and , though closely guarded , the doctor managed to get her alone for a moment and told her she must return to the @entity9 for treatment			1
the next thing she remembered was her mother - in - law tugging at her iv line , trying to end her life , she believes			0
@entity7 's husband , realizing his young bride would leave him if her health improved , conspired a way to make her stay -- he climbed into her bed and forced himself on her , knowing that if she was pregnant with his child she would n't be allowed to leave @entity6			1
luckily , her health did improve and knowing this was possibly her last chance at freedom , she appealed to her father - in - law who alone had the power to return to her to @entity9			1
' he arrives and almost immediately says : " i think it will be best if you leave with our approval on an @entity6 passport , which i have obtained for you			1
you have been granted a six - month visa for reasons of health			0
" ' he has a passport in hand for his @entity9 daughter - in - law , who by that stage had missed two periods			2
escape : @entity7 , pictured in 1972 , tries three times to escape to the @entity9 embassy but finally gets so ill she has to return to @entity9 for treatment she felt a huge sense of relief at that moment but when she got back to the compound her husband was incensed at the news and hit her			1
she boarded the first plane out			0
' when the plane takes off , i am filled with more fierce joy than my body can contain			0
and when i finally land on @entity9 soil , i literally kiss the ground , ' she writes			2
when she arrived home she suffered a miscarriage			0
' my body made that decision for me , ' she explains in the book			0
she returned to college where she was studying literature , found a job and applied to graduate school			0
two years later , she got her marriage to @entity119 annulled			2
@entity7 said she has shared her story , some 50 years on , to show her first - hand experience of the ' deep - seated the hatred of women ' in @entity161 culture			1
' i see how endemic indigenous barbarism and cruelty is and unlike many other intellectuals and feminists , i do n't try to romanticize or rationalize it , ' she writes , adding that she was lucky to escape with her life and will never return			0
@entity7 is a feminist scholar and a professor emerita of psychology and women 's studies at @entity265			1
she has changed the name of her former husband in her account .			0
