' he loved travel as well and was due to go on holiday in the next few weeks with one of his best friends to @entity51 where he had planned an itinerary of sight seeing and restaurant visiting as he was also very keen on food			2
' he was very thoughtful and caring and loved his family and friends dearly			1
one of the things we will always remember though about him was his fantastic sense of humour			0
it is very hard to think we will not get to laugh or talk with him anymore			0
his mother immediately called for an ambulance and @entity10 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , was rushed to hospital the 18 - year - old was placed in an induced coma for four days and died in hospital after apparently taking the legal high he bought online ' his life had such potential and was all in front of him , sadly it has been cut prematurely very short			1

detective constable @entity97 , of @entity20 police , warned : ' the clear issue is that people who state they have a strong view about not taking controlled drugs are importing and purchasing drugs which they read online are a substitute for controlled drugs			0
' people incorrectly believe that these ' legal highs ' are then both safe and appropriate alternatives to street drugs			0
@entity92 is believed to have died after taking the legal high @entity13 while celebrating the end of term ' just because something is not illegal does not make it safe			1
' it only becomes clear it is not safe when someone becomes severely harmed by taking it and subsequent investigations reveal substances within the compound can be lethal			0

' an mp today called for the government to spearhead a @entity132 bid to prosecute businesses selling deadly ' legal highs ' following the deaths of three men in just a year			2
@entity137 mp and former home office minister @entity138 wants a united legal attempt to prosecute anyone selling such drugs across @entity132			0
mr @entity138 said : ' i would suggest to the government that we need a concerted attempt to use every legal move we can to bring these people down if they can be identified as selling these drugs			0
' we need to take the profit out of it and throw the book at people			0
' only part of the answer is regulation and there does need to be more education			0
