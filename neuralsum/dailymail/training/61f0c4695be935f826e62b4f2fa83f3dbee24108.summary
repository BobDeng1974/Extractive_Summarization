the @entity19 has set up a working group to ' deter inappropiate relationships and the abuse of police powers to perpetrate sexual offending ' ' there are some important lessons that can be learned from others , we want to support our staff and stop them falling unwittingly into inappropriate relationships and to develop our own strategies to ensure that would be offenders are identified quickly and held to account			1

' as a result we are currently looking into a number of cases , many of which are historic			0
' our zero - tolerance attitude , reflected by the film and supported by our integrity hotline , demonstrates our dedication to proactively seeking out anyone who has abused their position of authority , and allows us to deal with them quickly and appropriately			0
' @entity140 , a lawyer who represents the victims of rape or sexual assault by officers , told @entity33 : ' if a woman reports rape or sexual assault by a police officer it is not just that the investigation has to be properly carried out , it has to be seen to be done properly in order for victims to have confidence in the system			1
