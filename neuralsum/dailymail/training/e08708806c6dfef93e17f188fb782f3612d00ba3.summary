universities should discriminate against applicants from private schools , grammars and high - performing comprehensives , government - funded research has suggested			1
the controversial study reccomends that universities should lower their entry requirements for pupils from non-selective and poor - performing state schools because they show more ‘ potential ’ , according to the @entity12			1
these students are ‘ significantly ’ more likely to graduate with a first or 2.1 in their degree than peers from private or high - achieving state schools who gained similar results at @entity21 and a-level , the study of millions of school - leavers found			2
the @entity12 says universities should lower their entry requirements for pupils from poor - performing state schools because they show more ‘ potential they are also less likely to drop out of their degree courses part - way through			1
the researchers , led by dr @entity29 , claim that selective schools may be better at drawing out good results from their pupils - a so - called ‘ teaching effect ’			1
they say that university entry grades should be lowered for pupils at comprehensives , particularly schools where pupils make poor progress , ‘ in order to equalise the potential of all students being admitted to university ’			1
the study – published yesterday by his own department – will disturb education secretary @entity47 who has warned that attempts to skew university admissions policies give weak schools an excuse to avoid improvement			1
in contrast , his colleagues at the @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , have urged universities to go further in introducing so - called ‘ contextual ’ admissions			1
but in a further finding , the study suggested that many costly initiatives aimed at encouraging less privileged youngsters to apply to university may have been wasted because they came too late in their school career			0
efforts should instead be focused on encouraging pupils to choose appropriate gcse subjects at 14 and boosting their achievement in them at 16			2
universities are likely to use the study to justify schemes that involve making lower offers to pupils from certain schools or groups or giving them places ahead of more advantaged applicants			1
education secretary @entity47 has warned that attempts to skew university admissions policies give weak schools an excuse to avoid improvement growing numbers of universities are adopting such policies but the research claims that ‘ more could be done ’			1
but critics claim the policies risk crude ‘ social engineering ’ and detract from attempts to boost academic standards in state schools			1
the new study will also add to confusion since separate research earlier this year claimed that those with top grades – mainly as at @entity98 – stood roughly the same chance of gaining a good degree regardless of whether they attended a state or private school			0
only students with slightly lower grades – bs and cs – were more likely to do well at university if they came from a state school , according to findings from the @entity111			0
it also suggested that ‘ contextual ’ admissions policies which take into account the average performance of an applicant ’s school are flawed			1
the performance of a school – whether high or low - achieving – was said to make little difference to a pupil ’s chances of achieving a first or 2.1 at university			0
however in her report , dr @entity124 , a researcher at the @entity12 and assistant professor of economics at @entity127 , said universities ‘ may wish to take into account a measure of school value - added ’ – how much progress it helps pupils to make – ‘ or school performance … when making their admissions offers ’			1
the report said it could not recommend ‘ specific changes that should be made to the entry offers of particular universities ’			1
but it added : ‘ these results provide suggestive evidence that universities may wish to consider lowering their entry requirements for pupils from non-selective or low - value - added state schools ( relative to pupils from selective or high - value - added state schools , or independent schools ) in order to equalise the potential of students being admitted from these different types of school			1
’ it said pupils from state grammars should be ‘ excluded from receiving these lower offers ’			0
according to the research , which tracked millions of school - leavers over several years , those from selective private or state schools or comprehensives with low numbers of pupils on free school meals are ‘ significantly more likely to drop out , significantly less likely to complete their degree and significantly less likely to graduate with a first or a 2.1 ’ than their counterparts with similar results in non-selective or lower - performing schools			2
among pupils with similar grades , pupils from selective independent schools were 6.4 percentage points less likely to complete their degree and 10.3 percentage points less likely to graduate with a first or 2.1			2
‘ those from non-selective or low - value - added state schools could be regarded as having higher “ potential ” than those from selective or high - value - added state schools or independent schools ’ , the report said			2
it suggested that private and selective schools ‘ may be better at producing good grades at @entity21 for their pupils than others , meaning that a pupil of given ability will obtain higher grades at a selective school than a non-selective community school ’			2
but it added that such schools may be preparing their pupils poorly for university study			2
‘ while independent or selective schools might be very successful at preparing students for @entity21 and @entity207 ( and equivalent ) exams , they may be less good at preparing students for independent study at university , ’ it said			0
@entity212 should consider introducing a ‘ quota system ’ to increase the number of state school pupils given places , according to one of its leading academics			0
professor @entity220 said the private school ‘ stranglehold ’ at @entity212 was worsening and something ‘ drastic ’ needed to be done			0
the academic and literary critic , a product of the old grammar school system , said figures for entry to @entity212 were ‘ still shockingly in favour of private schools ’			0
' stranglehold ' : professor @entity220 said it is getting harder and harder for state school students to get in to @entity212			0
pictured is @entity236 he told the @entity238 : ‘ it really should be considered whether you introduce a quota system			0
i do think something drastic has got to be done			0
i think that the private school stranglehold is actually getting worse			0
‘ it ’s getting harder and harder for people from very ordinary schools to get in ’			0
professor @entity220 , 80 , @entity212 ’s emeritus professor of @entity248 literature , acknowledged it was making efforts to encourage more state school applications but said more needed to be done , the @entity246 reported			0
official figures show that most elite universities increased their intake of state school pupils in the year £ 9,000 - a - year tuition fees were introduced , with only five – including @entity212 – seeing the proportion decline .			2

@entity12 says the best universities should *prioritise* pupils from poor schools
