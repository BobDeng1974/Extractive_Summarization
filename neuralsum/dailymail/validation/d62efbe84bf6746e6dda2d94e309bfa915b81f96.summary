it is possible that @entity2 distributed sensitive information through her personal email , the @entity0 now admits , and only a review of her messages will determine if she broke the rules			1
a @entity0 official who spoke to the @entity9 acknowledged that some of the correspondence @entity12 sent through her private email may constitute a breach of security guidelines			1
the official asserted that @entity12 did n't directly defy @entity0 's policies by using her personal email for government communications , but a manual obtained by news outlets shows that since 2005 @entity0 has directed its employees to use its email system because it has the ' proper level of security control			1

but top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate ' email-gate ' @entity0 deputy spokeswoman @entity36 insists that mrs. @entity2 did n't send any classified material through her private ' clintonemails.com ' account while she led the agency but top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate email-gate			1
@entity41 in early states worry the scandal is an early warning sign that @entity12 's presumed presidential campaign is on the path to destruction and could ' implode			1
' from the outset , the @entity0 has cautiously avoided declaring @entity12 innocent of any wrongdoing while encouraging reporters to give her the benefit of the doubt			2
' she and her team has said that it was not used for anything but unclassified work , ' @entity36 , deputy spokeswoman for @entity0 told reporters on wednesday , adding moments later , ' i do n’t think there was any indication she was doing anything but [ that ] here , so i do n’t think it ’s really a pertinent question			1
' further pressed to ' definitively ' claim @entity12 was n't sending classified information through her personal email – which is against the law – @entity36 argued that ' you ca n’t claim that about anyone ’s unclassified email			2
' she also noted in the exchange that the department does n't monitor its other employees ' private communications to make sure that classified information is n't being shared			2
' i ’m not sure why this would be anything different , ' @entity36 contended			0
' i do n’t know why this would be held to a different standard			0
' when @entity12 did need to discuss classified information she communicated through her her staff , the @entity0 spokeswoman claimed			2
later asked if @entity12 's exclusive use of personal email was ' problematic , ' @entity36 stated that that ' there was no prohibition on this practice			2
' ' so i ’m not going to make a judgment about appropriateness or not , ' she said			0
' i ’m telling you what the regulations say and do n’t say			0
she operated under them , and that ’s as much as i can say			0
' guidelines published by @entity96 and other publications on thursday evening suggest otherwise , however			0
' it is the @entity0 ’s general policy that normal day - to - day operations be conducted on an authorized [ @entity102 ] , which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation , authentication and encryption , to ensure confidentiality , integrity , and availability of the resident information , ' the @entity0 's @entity98 says			1
an official who spoke to @entity96 said that it is true that ' sensitive but unclassified information should be handled on a system with certain security requirements ' with the caveat ' except in certain circumstances			2
' the @entity0 insider said it 's not true that ' by using personal email she is automatically out of step ' with the guidelines outlined in the manual			1
likewise , the @entity9 's source at @entity0 said , ' we are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of secretary @entity12 ’s 55,000 pages of e-mails			1
' national democrats aligned with @entity12 are blowing off the email squabble as background noise that wo n't affect voters ' perceptions of their party 's most formidable presidential candidate			1
' voters do not give a s * * * about what email @entity2 used			1
they do n't even give a fart , ' @entity140 , confidante of and adviser to @entity12 , ' said thursday on @entity144			0
media matters founder @entity145 said in an op - ed on @entity144 that the media ' hype ' around @entity12 's emails is the ' perfect example of " gotcha " journalism , where reporters will take any bait the @entity154 give them without proper vetting			2
' @entity145 , whose group @entity157 runs a @entity159 fact - checking service called @entity160 , also argued that the @entity161 ' are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny			0
' ' their perfectly usual , above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while @entity154 are left relatively unscathed , ' he charged			0
regardless , top level communicators on the left and the right say that @entity12 currently risks mishandling the crisis			0
former @entity173 senior adviser @entity172 has said that the longer @entity12 and her team wait to respond to the flurry of questions about her use of not only a non-official email for her work at the @entity0 but also a personal domain name and a private server , the likelier the situation is to get out of hand			1
' it ’s a ball of wool that wo n’t go away until the questions are answered , ' he told the @entity187 on thursday			0
@entity188 , part i : likely @entity154 presidential candidate @entity190 goaded @entity12 to be more transparent @entity188 , part ii : @entity12 responded by saying ' i want the public to see my email ' and asking her old agency to hurry up the process @entity196 , a former spokesman for @entity197 , told @entity198 , @entity12 's team is ' making a big mistake ' by not letting her address the issue publicly			1
' this is immediately understood and problematic in the eyes of the average voter			0
everyone can relate to it and understand it … it cuts through the clutter in a way that hurts her , ' he said			0
' this is one of those issues that ’s not going away anytime soon			0
' @entity12 fired off a tweet on wednesday night saying she wanted the public to read her emails and had given the @entity0 permission to publish them once they it finishes its review			2
and a spokesman for her confirmed to the press at the beginning of the week that all of her emails that pertain to the @entity0 have been remanded to the federal government			0
questions continue to linger , however , and neither @entity12 nor her team have given a reasonable explanation for the former @entity173 administration official 's actions			0
@entity234 , chairman of @entity235 ’s @entity41 , told @entity96 the email controversy ' adds more reason ' for other politicians in the party to explore presidential campaigns			0
' because , who knows ? she could implode totally , ' he said .			1

' day - to - day operations [ must ] be conducted on an authorized [ system ] which has the proper level of security control , ' @entity0 policy reads
political insiders are *fretting* that ' email-gate ' could sink mrs. @entity2 's presidential *ambitions* and worry that they do n't have a @entity252
