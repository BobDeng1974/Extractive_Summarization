@entity0 joined @entity1 to play in matches like saturday 's @entity4 derby victory over @entity5 , but did not expect to be the man scoring the last - gasp winner			1
the @entity9 international moved to @entity10 from @entity11 over the summer and made an instant impact as he grabbed the only goal of the game against their local rivals			1
@entity0 appeared on the edge of the @entity5 box in added time to secure three points for the visitors after both sides had been reduced to 10 men			1
@entity0 was delighted with his start at @entity1 and was happy to be involved on the opening day of the new @entity28 season			1
' i was just really happy to play to be honest and to score on top of that , well , i never imagined it , ' he said			2
' i saw the keeper coming out in the corner of my eye and i wanted to touch the ball around him and put it in			2
it all happened really quickly			2
i did n't get any time to think about it and that was probably a good thing			2
' i really enjoyed it and it 's why i wanted to come here , to play in games like this			2
i 'm really happy to be here			0
' many would have been surprised to see @entity0 appear on the edge of the @entity5 box in stoppage time but @entity1 boss @entity24 believes it shows how his side want to play this season			1
' this is a picture of what is our philosophy , our style , ' he told @entity1 's official website			1
' it is important as it shows our ambition and our philosophy to try and win			0
' he was brilliant , but not only him , the whole team			0
it was an unbelievable win because last season we came here and left with zero points			0
' difficult debut : @entity81 also made a late cameo appearance but was unable to turn the tide @entity5 handed two of their own summer signings their debuts as @entity87 and @entity88 were named in @entity90 's starting line - up			1
@entity81 also made his bow with a late substitute appearance but it was former @entity95 full - back @entity88 who particularly caught the eye			1
the 24 - year - old was named in the @entity98 last season but was left deflated following his impressive debut			1
' i had all my family here and it was a proud moment for me personally , ' he said			0
' but it 's not about me , it 's about the team and getting the three points			0
it 's not personal , it 's not about individual performances			0
the first thing you look at is the result and we did n't get that on saturday , so i 'm very disappointed			0
' the @entity5 face another @entity4 derby when they travel to @entity116 next weekend and @entity88 is keen to get the season up and running			1
' we 'll sit down , go over it , see what we can take out of the game and where we could have gone on to win it , ' he added			0
' it 's just about taking the positives into the next game and looking forward to it			0
' @entity128 finishing cost us - @entity90			0
