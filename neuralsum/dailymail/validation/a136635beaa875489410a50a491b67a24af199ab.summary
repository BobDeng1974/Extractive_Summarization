even the world - renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than @entity4 's ' @entity3 ' on his day			1
@entity3 earned that nickname during his five years with @entity6 , yet it was in @entity7 where he was labelled ' wasted talent ' and @entity4 gladly signed the maestro in may 2006			1
' when he is fit ... ' seem to be the same , old four words that crop up when @entity3 becomes the topic of discussion yet , even at the age of 34 , he still knows how to make @entity4 tick			1
@entity3 earned the nickname ' @entity3 ' in @entity7 and he continues to make @entity4 tick at 34 @entity16 celebrates with @entity3 during their @entity18 win against @entity19 @entity3 has found minutes hard to come by at @entity4 previously but injuries can prove problematic pulling on the yellow of @entity6 from 2001 , the all - round midfielder 's potential was recognised			1
remember @entity25 's @entity24 in 2002 ? @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , among others , playing in a ' secret tournament ' hosted by @entity37			1
then , among the world 's finest footballers , was a 20 - something @entity3			1
more than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties , and getting better with age			0
take the former @entity44 youth 's cameo against @entity45 on march 1 , for example			0
there was a moment when @entity3 chased the ball from @entity50 , to @entity51 , to @entity52 , then back to @entity51 , and won the tackle			2
it merited a standing ovation , before he settled the bag of nerves the @entity58 had become with an 89th - minute goal to make it 2 - 0			0
' this geezer 's unreal , how is he 34 ? still producing moments of class like that , he 's a brilliant player , ' one supporter said in his analysis on @entity68 afterwards			2
@entity3 scores against @entity45 previously as he came on as a substitute with just eight minutes remaining @entity3 shoots to make it 2 - 0 to @entity4 against @entity45 on march 1 and settle their nerves @entity3 should start against @entity73 but is not guaranteed to do so under @entity74 @entity3 mocked up as his nickname ' @entity3 ' 87 - vs @entity19 ( march 4 ) 8 - vs @entity45 ( march 1 ) 9 - vs @entity76 ( february 25 ) 14 - vs @entity77 ( february 21 ) 18 - vs @entity78 ( february 15 ) that 's exactly how it comes – in ' moments '			1
the @entity83 captain does n't devastate week in , week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift			0
the mentality to pass sideways is lost on @entity3 , who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward , showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the @entity18			2
yet @entity3 – a one - two kind of player , who bleeds the @entity4 way – has averaged just 19 games per @entity18 season under @entity74 in his nine years in north @entity96			1
the injury - prone playmaker has been unlucky , rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an @entity101 in 2012			2
it cost him more than two years , and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since			0
minutes have been hard to come by			0
eighteen against @entity78 in the @entity106 , 14 against @entity77 in the @entity18 , and just nine in the 3 - 1 defeat by @entity76 in the @entity108 at the @entity58			0
his eight minutes against @entity45 led to a rare start against @entity19 , and @entity74 should persist with the playmaker			2
there is no doubt the @entity4 manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension			0
' if you love football , you love @entity3 , ' purred @entity74 after their 3 - 2 win against @entity121 in the @entity106 fourth round			1
@entity3 treated that match as an exhibition			0
his assist for @entity127 's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no - look pass led to a one - two that allowed @entity3 to score a volley in the second			1
you may remember it better for @entity133 declaring he would ' two - foot him ' if he tried that in his neck of the woods , but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess			0
@entity3 makes a no - look pass against @entity121 which pundit @entity133 found disrespectful the @entity83 midfielder used the same move a number of times during @entity4 's 3 - 2 defeat of @entity121 during interviews @entity3 can look uneasy , like a teenager making a television debut , not a player just one cap short of a century for @entity83			1
modesty , can be another way to put it			0
this week we heard @entity154 , 33 , has years left			0
can @entity3 keep being his tireless self ? well , a @entity157 may be aged but , when it 's only got so many miles on the clock , it runs as good as any			2
@entity3 has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but , with him now fit , @entity74 should start the 34 - year - old against @entity73 on monday , then watch him go .			1

@entity3 's *career* has been *hampered* by injury at times
@entity3 earned the nickname ' @entity3 ' at @entity6
the 34 - year - old averages just 19 games per season under @entity74
@entity3 starred in @entity25 's @entity24 in 2002 with others such as @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity31
