by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 12:22 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 13 february 2013 the @entity3 and @entity4 faced fresh anguish over privacy today after @entity8 and @entity9 magazines published photographs of pregnant @entity4 in a bikini and more publications round the world lined up to do the same			1
palace sources condemned the ‘ violating ’ pictures , which show the couple walking along a beach while holidaying on the secluded @entity19 island of @entity20			1
@entity21 understands publishers in the @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 have also bought the set for more than £ 100,000 in total			1
@entity8 gossip magazine @entity28 , which caused outrage when it published a photograph of princess @entity31 as she lay dying , splashed pictures of the duchess and her growing baby bump across its front page			1
@entity9 magazine @entity36 has also printed the pictures , as well as photographs of @entity4 's sister @entity39 in a bikini , claiming they were taken by a member of the public on a public beach			1
editor @entity44 said the royal couple are not a ‘ protected species ’ outside @entity47 adding : ' this is not a hard decision			2
@entity4 's on a public beach , there are other holiday - makers there and she looks fabulous			1
' however , @entity20 is a private island and there is an expectation of privacy for anyone holidaying there because the paparazzi is banned			1
pregnant : @entity60 of @entity61 , seen here with her husband at the unveiling of her picture at the @entity66 , has been photographed on holiday in @entity20 @entity4 , who is about four months pregnant , is wearing a bright blue halter - neck bikini with her slightly rounded stomach clearly visible			1
her arm is draped over her husband ’s shoulders while @entity73 , who is wearing blue baggy shorts and sunglasses , has an arm protectively around his wife ’s back			0
the headline on the front of @entity28 , which goes on sale today , reads ‘ @entity4 and @entity73 – honeymoon for three ’			2
@entity36 editor @entity44 said she had no qualms about running the pictures , insisting they were taken by a fellow tourist on @entity20 – and not a paparazzo			1
they have published a poster today showing pictures of @entity4 to promote their next edition , which is out on monday			1
‘ she is on a public beach and she was mingling with holiday makers , ’ she said			1
@entity97 getaway : the couple are staying at a £ 5million , five - bedroom mansion , one of the most opulent on the island she told @entity102 that there were other tourists in the photos and ‘ it ’ s a very different situation to the nude photos			2
’ this was a reference to photos of @entity111 taken by a @entity24 photographer last year and which caused distress to the @entity4 and prince @entity73			1
@entity115 storm : @entity9 magazine @entity36 has produced this poster advertising their next edition out on monday ‘ there is no photographer hiding in the bushes and she is not inside a private villa , ’ said miss @entity44			1
@entity122 has angrily hit out at the impending publication of the photos in @entity125 as ‘ a clear breach of the couple ’s privacy			1
’ but miss @entity44 said @entity9 did not view the royal family as a ‘ protected species ’ like the @entity47			2
‘ the @entity47 have a great deal more sensitivity to royals than we do here in @entity136 , ’ she said			0
‘ as @entity9 , we see this every day			2
we see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive here			2
' our readers are going to love these photos			0
i do n't expect any backlash at all really			0
i think she 's looking fabulous and healthy and ( with ) a beautiful bump , like we have n't seen her before			0
@entity4 ‘ looks so much better than the poorly and sickly woman we saw coming out of hospital , which makes these photos more of a celebration , ’ she said			0
it is not known how much the magazine has paid for the exclusive @entity9 rights to the photos , which , said miss @entity44 , would eventually be published around the world			1
‘ everyone but the @entity47 has or will publish these pics , ’ she said			0
it is not the first time an @entity9 magazine has published photos of royals against the wishes of the royal family			1
one of the most controversial decisions was made by @entity169 magazine - engaged in a bitter publication war with @entity36 - which revealed in 2008 that prince @entity171 had been posted to @entity172 , putting the royal at risk			1
last night , royal sources said @entity73 , in particular , still felt ‘ very bruised ’ about the fresh breach of privacy so soon after the same magazine splashed topless photographs of @entity4 across its front page beneath the headline ‘ the queen is naked ’			1
safe haven : @entity20 is well - known amongst celebs as a place to go to avoid media intrusion the source said @entity73 felt very strongly at the time that he had somehow ‘ failed ’ to protect his @entity189 intimate photographs are thought to have been taken from a boat using a long lens camera			2
chi magazine , which is owned by former @entity8 prime minister @entity194 , boasts : ‘ the extraordinary images of the @entity3 and @entity4 on their dream holiday in the @entity19			1
‘ the future mum , now four months pregnant , wore a tiny bikini which showed off her visible bump			0
’ the photographs are believed to have been offered to several other magazines around the world and could fetch up to £ 250,000			0
members of the @entity111 family have accompanied the couple on their holiday			0
( @entity207 ) @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity39 yesterday a spokesman for @entity122 said : ‘ we are disappointed that photographs of the @entity3 and @entity4 on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas			1
‘ this is a clear breach of the couple ’s right to privacy			1
’ a palace source said : ‘ it ’s violating ’			0
the duke and duchess , who are expecting their first child in july , flew to a £ 19,000 - a - week luxury villa on the island of @entity20 last week			2
in the wake of the princess @entity31 's 1997 death , when the car she was in crashed while being pursued by papparazi , the @entity226 has asked the media to limit its intrusion into the private lives of the aristocracy			0
a @entity115 spokesman once said : ' @entity235 feel they have a right to privacy when they are going about everyday , private activities			2
' they recognise there is a public interest in them and what they do , but they do not think this extends to photographing the private activities of them and their friends			0
' the @entity47 media has for the most part observed this request			0
when the topless pictures of @entity60 surfaced , no @entity47 newspapers or magazines published the images , even though they had spread all over the internet			0
similarly , only the @entity259 published the naked pictures of prince @entity171 as he partied in a @entity262 penthouse			0
however , the right to privacy has been a source of contention between the press and the @entity115			2
@entity267 once even refused to reveal the name of @entity4 and @entity73 's new cocker spaniel puppy , calling it an invasion of their privacy			2
@entity4 finally revealed the name of the black pup three weeks after royal aides refused to confirm it			0
she told schoolchildren in @entity279 it was called @entity281 ( @entity8 for wolf ) while on an engagement			0
the royal couple are two of the world 's most recognisable people but it can be a struggle to guard their privacy @entity4 ’s parents , @entity210 and @entity291 , and her sister @entity39 , flew out at the same time and are renting a villa nearby			1
it is understood that bikini photographs of @entity39 are also being touted for sale			0
@entity20 , a private island with just 74 villas and one small hotel , is where princess @entity300 once had a holiday home and is frequented by stars including @entity304			0
@entity4 and @entity73 , who were accompanied by a team of bodyguards , have chosen the island for seven of their last eight holidays because of the privacy it affords them			2
@entity20 is patrolled both on - shore and off - shore by the island ’s private security team , but they failed to spot the paparazzi waiting for the couple to emerge on the beach			1
paradise : @entity20 is a private island in the @entity19 where princess @entity300 once had a holiday home famed for its palm - fringed beaches and upmarket watering holes , @entity20 is one of the most exclusive holiday destinations in the world			1
the tiny @entity19 island was made famous in the 1960s when its owner , @entity329 , gave the @entity331 's late sister , @entity300 , a 10 - acre plot of land as a wedding present			0
lord @entity329 bought the island , which had been left to wrack and ruin following the decline of the great sugar plantations in the 19th century , for £ 45,000 in 1958			0
in the early days , life on the island was simple : with little fresh water and dusty tracks for roads			0
but the eccentric @entity344 noble struck on the idea of parcelling up and selling off small pockets of land to carefully vetted @entity348 commissioned theatrical designer , @entity349 , to build her a villa , @entity351			0
she adored @entity20 because it was somewhere she could let her hair down away from prying eyes and public @entity356 included her cousin @entity357 , who had a villa nearby , gangster @entity359 - with whom princess @entity300 is rumoured to have had an affair - and @entity361 was here , too , that she conducted her long relationship with @entity364 , a landscape gardener 17 years her @entity365 gave @entity351 to her son , @entity366 , when he married in 1998 , but , much to her distress , he quickly sold @entity368 1989 @entity369 was transformed from a family estate into a private limited company - @entity371 - with the 100 or so homeowners as @entity374 status as a private island means that the paparazzi are banned - making it a @entity377 for celebrities including @entity304 and @entity380			1
paradise : in 1989 @entity369 was transformed from a family estate into a private limited company the island 's only watering hole , @entity386 , and its legendary ' jump - up ' sees rock and roll stars sipping rum punch next royalty without a care in the world			0
wealthy holidaymakers are attracted by the island 's balmy climate and beautiful beaches			0
there is no ' out of season ' as @entity20 is far enough south to avoid hurricanes and enjoys temperatures of around @entity404 ( 75f ) to @entity403 ( 80f ) all year round			2
it is also one of the safest places in the @entity19			0
the only murder in @entity20 ’s recent history occurred 10 years ago when a @entity24 heiress was found stabbed to death in her villa - a crime that has never been solved .			1

@entity122 : this is a clear breach of privacy and we are disappointed
