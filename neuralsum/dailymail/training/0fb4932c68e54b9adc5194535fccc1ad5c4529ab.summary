by @entity0 a quarter of a century ago , a young oil executive called @entity2 had a meeting with the then @entity4			1
@entity2 was interested in becoming a @entity6 vicar and the @entity4 agreed to see him to assess his suitability			1
the meeting did not go well			0
at the end of it the @entity4 told him bluntly : ‘ you have no future in the @entity6			1
’ none the less , @entity2 managed to get a second interview — with the vicar of @entity16 in @entity17			1
this did n’t go well either			0
when he was asked what he would do if he visited a female parishioner who needed help with a blocked drainpipe , @entity2 replied that he would send his wife up a ladder to clear it — his wife being a lot better at diy than he was			1
@entity28 and unstuffy : the archbishop of canterbury @entity2 , who joined the @entity6 25 years ago remarkably , he was then sent for a third interview with the @entity32 , who asked what he would do if he was turned down			1
@entity2 laughed and said he would ‘ take my wife out for the most expensive meal i can afford to celebrate ’			1
jump forward a quarter of a century and @entity2 is now the archbishop of @entity37			1
his predecessor , @entity38 , famously said that he would need the constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros			0
on the face of it , @entity2 had neither			1
ecclesiastically speaking , he was very much the man from nowhere having only been a bishop for four - and - a - half months when he was appointed			2
no one with less experience had been given the top job since the 17th century			0
yet , two years on , @entity2 is generally reckoned to be making a pretty good fist of it			1
he ’s just managed to persuade the @entity51 to back women bishops while successfully appeasing the traditionalists			0
in marked contrast to several predecessors , he is unshowy , unstuffy and prefers to travel by public transport — so much so , the @entity58 chauffeur has taken early retirement			0
and while he has never hidden his opposition to gay marriage , none other than the normally implacable gay activist @entity61 has declared that he is ‘ a genuine , sincere , open - minded person ’			0
tough job : the role of archbishop of @entity37 is not an easy one , but two years on , @entity2 is generally reckoned to be making a pretty good fist of it as this new biography reveals , there is far more to @entity2 than you might think from his rather bland and doughy exterior			1
if you ’re looking for a rational explanation for why he has embraced certainties so wholeheartedly , you might find it in the swirling chaos of his childhood			0
his father was an alcoholic fantasist who by a barely credible quirk of fate was once engaged to @entity82			1
his parents ’ marriage collapsed after three years and though @entity2 had an ostensibly privileged upbringing — @entity86 followed by @entity87 — life at home was far from easy			1
at school he showed no interest in religion			0
the only interesting thing he can remember happening in chapel at @entity86 was when the headmaster fell out of the pulpit			0
overcoming tragedy : @entity2 and his wife @entity98 say their daughter 's death brought them closer to @entity103 while he did n’t do well in exams — his a-level grades were @entity106 — he scraped into @entity87 to study law			1
there , he attended chapel occasionally , but only for the music ; he was more interested in rowing			0
but then , shortly after the start of his second year , something extraordinary happened			0
one evening @entity2 was persuaded to go to chapel by a friend of his			1
he sat through the sermon ‘ bored out of my mind ’ , then went back to his friend ’s rooms			0
there , they began to talk about what it meant to be a @entity125			0
‘ and suddenly i saw the grace , the freedom , the free giving of @entity103 , which meant that to follow him would not be constraining but would be the most ultimately liberating thing i could ever do			0
’ it was n’t long before @entity2 ’s new faith was put to perhaps the greatest test of all			2
in 1983 his wife , @entity98 , and their seven - month - old daughter , @entity135 , were in a car crash in @entity138			1
the child was thrown from the car and suffered a fatal head injury			0
both @entity2 and his wife believed the tragedy brought them closer to @entity103			2
indeed , @entity98 said that while she was sitting at the side of the road waiting for the ambulance to come she ’d had ‘ one of the most powerful experiences of @entity103 i have ever had ’			0
when @entity2 left his job in the oil industry to become a vicar , his former boss remarked that it was the only known case of a rat joining a sinking ship			2
but as far as @entity2 was concerned , it was a ship ripe for re-floating and launching in a new , more clearly defined direction			2
a graduate of the @entity162 at @entity163 — set up by his fellow @entity164 and @entity87 contemporary , @entity166 — @entity2 has proved to be a canny mix of the inflexible and the expedient			2
etonian : @entity2 , aged 18 , pictured as he was leaving @entity86 while he still believes homosexuality is against the will of @entity103 , his stance may have softened since he became archbishop — he ’s pro civil partnerships and made it plain the @entity6 ‘ must have no truck with homophobia ’			1
as @entity180 states in his introduction , this is not an authorised biography — but neither is it entirely unauthorised : various friends and colleagues of @entity2 ’s were given the all - clear to talk to him			1
the result is a solid , fair - minded and scrupulously researched affair which unfortunately lacks a quality that @entity2 seems to possess in abundance : humour			1
he ’s got an appealingly dry , self - deprecating wit , once describing himself in his archbishop ’s robes as looking like ‘ a self - propelled toadstool with a pointy hat ’			2
by an odd coincidence , i was at prep school with @entity2 , though i ca n’t say i remember him and very much doubt if he remembers me			2
i did , however , come across this description of the @entity201 in the school magazine written when @entity2 was 12 : ‘ @entity203 looked sad as he picked his way past the ruins of a gun with its crew sprawled around it			2
in the distance you could vaguely see men and women looking for the bodies and stealing the clothes of the dead			0
then , from far away , came the sound of marching			0
’ even then , it seems , he had a robustly unvarnished view of human nature and an ear tuned to the beat of a distant drum .			0

at his first interview to join the @entity6 , @entity2 was snubbed
but 25 years later he is *enjoying* second year as archbishop of @entity37
new biography reveals there is more to @entity2 than his bland exterior
his father was an alcoholic fantasist who was once engaged to *actress* @entity82
in 1983 his seven - month - old daughter , @entity135 , died in a car crash
