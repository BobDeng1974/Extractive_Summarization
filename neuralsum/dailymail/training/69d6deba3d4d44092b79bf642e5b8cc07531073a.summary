he has become as well known for his acid - tongued outbursts as for his historical insights			1
but yesterday @entity3 faced calls to be dropped as a @entity6 panellist after his latest outrageous appearance on @entity8			1
the broadcaster and @entity11 expert said @entity12 resented @entity13 and the @entity14 for liberating it from @entity17 occupation , adding : ‘ people do n’t like being freed			1
his comments prompted a backlash from viewers , who branded his performance ‘ rude ’ , ‘ intolerant ’ and ‘ offensive ’			1
the academic has previously been accused of racism after describing @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 as ‘ feeble little countries ’ on the @entity43 panel programme , and blaming ‘ black culture ’ for the riots that swept the country last august			1
@entity48 troops wading ashore from landing craft during the @entity50 in 1944			2
dr @entity3 said @entity13 and @entity14 adding : ' what thanks did we get ? ' bombardment : the embattled @entity55 suburb of @entity55 has fallen to government troops , ending a bloody , month - long siege during which hundreds of people are thought to have been killed @entity60 relations began to sour after @entity12 's surrender to the @entity62			1
the @entity63 felt bitterness towards the @entity13 for evacuating @entity65 after being cut off by the @entity67 army - in a move even @entity69 described as a ' colossal military disaster '			2
meanwhile , @entity13 was understandably frustrated by @entity12 's decision to collaborate with the enemy			2
within two weeks of the armistice signing , the @entity13 had shelled the @entity63 fleet , fearing it could fall into @entity67 hands			2
this onslaught , at @entity78 , on the coast of what was then @entity81 , left 1,297 @entity63 sailors dead and 350 wounded			2
over the next four years , four more @entity12 @entity63 colonies were hit - with around 10,000 @entity63 killed or injured			2
the turning point came on august 24 , 1944 , with an uprising of the @entity86 against the @entity67 garrison in @entity88			2
shortly after , the @entity89 under @entity90 entered the fray			0
and when the @entity14 entered @entity88 , they were warmly greeted			0
but the sheer number of @entity14 troops took its toll on the city 's infrastructure - and tensions grew between the liberated and the liberators			0
with the @entity48 rescue came @entity12 's search for a national identity - and a return to its dignity			0
in his appearance on @entity8 this week , dr @entity3 , 67 , said the @entity105 should not intervene in @entity106 because nations should free themselves from oppression			1
he said : ‘ humanitarian intervention is almost always disastrous			0
let me give you an example , it ’s called @entity12			0
‘ you will remember @entity13 and @entity14 liberated @entity12			0
what thanks did we get from them ? the @entity63 have spent the last 40 years trying to obliterate the shame by doing everything they can to damage @entity13 and @entity14			0
’ he went on : ‘ people do n’t like being freed , they mistake liberators for conquerors			1
’ shocked host @entity123 asked if he was suggesting @entity13 and the @entity124 should not have acted to save @entity12 in 1944			0
dr @entity3 replied : ‘ no , i ’m not @entity3			1
we did n’t go into @entity12 to liberate @entity12 , we went into @entity12 to destroy @entity17			0
’ he also accused his fellow panellist @entity27 , shadow chief secretary to the treasury , of ‘ cheap posturing ’ and branded @entity129 mp @entity28 ‘ pompous ’			0
when an audience member dared to accuse him of ‘ propaganda ’ , he turned on him , saying : ‘ why do you have the insolence to think that your opinion is better than anybody else ’s ? ’ dr @entity3 also attacked conservative mp @entity25 , calling him ‘ completely inhuman ’			1
@entity3 made his comments to an audience at @entity139 on thursday night 's @entity8 when the panel were discussing whether it would be right to intervene in @entity106 to give his remarks some historical context , the @entity67 military machine had defeated the @entity63 by mid- 1940			1
an armistice , signed in june , saw @entity88 governed by the @entity62 - and the establishment of @entity12 - a government in thrall to their conquerors			0
many in the @entity8 audience no doubt wondered what military strategy ' @entity151 ' @entity3 would have offered as an alternative to the @entity48 liberation			1
fortunately , @entity69 and @entity155 had made up their minds - which saw @entity14 troops entering @entity88 in 1944 , and @entity17 's retreat			0
dr @entity3 says ' we did n't have humanitarian intervention to save @entity161 ( left ) and said @entity13 has this ' weird notion , exemplified by the divinely ordained @entity163 that you go and give people freedom ' last stand : a lone resistance fighter in the embattled neighbourhood of @entity55 hours before government troops stormed the district yesterday dozens of viewers complained about dr @entity3 ’s behaviour on the social networking site @entity176 , with several calling for him to be dropped			1
one , @entity177 said : ‘ why is @entity3 allowed on the @entity6 unchallenged ? the bile and excrement spewing from his mouth is as offensive as any @entity182 tirade			1
’ a @entity6 spokesman said 72 complaints were made about the programme and added : ‘ the selection of potential panellists is an ongoing process			0

dr @entity3 says nations ' do n't like to be freed ' and says they mistake their ' liberator ' for their ' conqueror '
