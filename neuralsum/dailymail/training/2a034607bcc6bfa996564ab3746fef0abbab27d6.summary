@entity0 has been named the @entity2 manager of the month for november after guiding @entity3 to three victories from four matches			1
@entity0 's side beat @entity7 1 - 0 at @entity8 , overcame @entity9 2 - 0 at the @entity10 and also claimed a 1 - 0 victory over @entity12 at home			1
the only blot on @entity0 's copybook for november was a 1 - 0 loss against @entity17 at @entity18			1
in fact , the last time the @entity46 won it was a year ago in november 2013 , when his @entity33 side went on a superb run and shot up into the top five in the @entity2			2
the first time @entity0 claimed the accolade was in february 2006 , while he was manager of @entity17			2
the award completes quite a turnaround for @entity0 who saw a large section of the @entity33 faithful calling for his sacking after @entity3 's dreadful start to the season			1
with the @entity63 languishing in the bottom three of the @entity2 in the middle of october , it took a 1 - 0 home victory over @entity67 to turn their campaign around			1
@entity0 had come under pressure from @entity3 supporters earlier in the season who called for his sacking @entity74 ( right ) and the @entity3 players celebrate @entity77 's winner against @entity7 @entity3 1 - 0 @entity7 @entity9 0 - 2 @entity3 @entity3 2 - 0 @entity12 @entity17 1 - 0 @entity3 but , in their previous home match , the @entity33 trailed @entity79 2 - 0 and a group of supporters raised banners with ' @entity83 ' emblazoned across them - a website which had been set up with the sole objective to have the @entity3 boss removed from his position			1
@entity89 's two goals rescued a point for @entity0 's seemingly beleaguered side and there has been quite a turnaround in fortunes in recent weeks			0
since then , @entity0 's side have claimed eight victories from 12 matches in all competitions - including becoming the first side to beat league leaders @entity101			2
the @entity33 will head to the @entity102 for saturday 's late kick - off this weekend as they look to pile more misery on @entity106 boss @entity105			0
however , @entity0 will be forced to field third - choice goalkeeper @entity108 - who is just 21 - and the supposed ' curse ' of the manager of the month could potentially strike again as a result			0
the other nominees for the november managerial award were @entity101 's @entity115 - whose side remained unbeaten at the top of the @entity2 until last weekend - @entity119 boss @entity118 and @entity121 's @entity120			0
@entity77 ( left ) scores a neat flick against @entity9 during the 2 - 0 win at the @entity10 @entity0 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity7 boss @entity125 after @entity3 's 1 - 0 victory it is often said that the @entity2 manager of the month award is a ' curse ' for any boss ; their side will inevitably lose their next match			1
@entity3 travel to the @entity102 to face @entity106 on saturday evening and look set to field a third - choice goalkeeper , so the supposed ' curse ' could come back to bite @entity0			0
here , @entity137 looks at whether or not the ' curse ' is fact or fiction ... - the ' curse ' hit @entity37 manager @entity36 as his side succumbed to a 4 - 2 loss away at @entity101 after he won the august award			0
perhaps it is unfair to say a curse struck when losing away at the league leaders , however			0
- @entity39 boss @entity38 celebrated his september award by hammering @entity149 8 - 0 in the most eye - catching result of the season so far			1
it seems the supposed curse did not affect the @entity39			0
- october 's winner @entity40 saw his @entity17 side draw 0 - 0 away at @entity156 , hardly a curse there either			2
