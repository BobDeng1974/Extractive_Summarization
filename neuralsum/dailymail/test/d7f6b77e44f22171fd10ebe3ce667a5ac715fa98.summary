these days , @entity0 is a celebrity associated with tears , and battles against drink and depression			0
but , nearly a quarter of a century ago , @entity4 was just a footballer			1
not an ordinary footballer - he was a brilliantly talented maverick , but still a footballer			2
and 24 years ago today , he scored what was arguably the finest goal of his career			1
there are some who might say it was the finest goal ever scored at @entity14			1
the other main contender for that prize is probably another of his , for @entity18 against @entity19 at @entity20			0
@entity4 hits the 35 - yard free - kick that would cement his place in @entity24 legend the @entity24 midfielder struck a ferocious shot that has gone down as one of the all - time great goals at @entity14 @entity4 's goal came five minutes into an @entity30 semi-final against @entity24 's arch - rivals , @entity32 @entity34 goalkeeper @entity33 ( right ) got his hands to the ball but the power on @entity4 's shot still beat him but april 14 , 1991 was @entity30 semi-final day			1
fierce rivals battling it out for a place in the final when the oldest cup competition in football meant so much to every club that entered			2
@entity32 won the league that year			2
but had you asked their fans at @entity14 that day whether they would rather win the title or the @entity30 having knocked out @entity24 , and many would have opted for the latter			1
they did n't get the choice , however , and that was because of @entity4			2
it took him just five minutes to make the indelible mark			0
@entity24 won a free - kick 35 yards from goal			1
certainly not @entity59 , who was commentating on the game for the @entity61			0
@entity4 runs towards the @entity24 fans to celebrate as @entity63 ( left ) joins the wild scenes the then @entity18 star leaps into the air to celebrate his glorious strike at the home of football @entity4 's goal set @entity24 on their way to a 3 - 1 victory , and they would go on to beat @entity75 in the final ' @entity77 going to have a crack ? , ' he asked			1
it was a relaxed , throwaway question			0
' he is you know , ' came the next line shortly after , excitement barely registering			0
@entity4 took a run - up at the ball , and swung hard with his right boot			1
he nailed it , right on the sweet spot			0
the shot quickly became a cannonball , bursting through @entity33 's gloves and into the top corner of the net , despite the goalkeeper getting his hands to the ball			2
' oh i say ! ' screamed @entity59 , whose commentary would now go down in legend as well as the goal			0
' brilliant ! ' @entity24 fans celebrated wildly in the stands			0
' that ... is ... schoolboy 's own stuff			0
oh , i bet even he ca n't believe it			0
' is there anything left from this man to surprise us ? that is one of the finest free - kicks this stadium has ever seen			1
' it was , and still is			0
24 years from now it still will be			1
so let 's forget for a moment about the @entity0 we know today , and simply celebrate the genius of @entity4			2
( left - right ) @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 join @entity4 to celebrate at the end of the match			1

it is 24 years to the day since @entity4 scored in the @entity30 semi-final against @entity32
@entity4 struck a fierce 35 - yard free - kick that beat @entity33
it was *hailed* as one of the best goals in @entity14 *history* , and that comment still applies
