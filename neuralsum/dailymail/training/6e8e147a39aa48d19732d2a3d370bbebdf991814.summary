@entity0 is ‘ uncomfortable ’ with calling himself a feminist it was claimed today – after refusing to wear a t - shirt backing a new women ’s equality campaign			1
the prime minister rejected the chance to wear a ‘ this is what a feminist looks like ’ t - shirt – despite being asked five times by a women ’s magazine			1
deputy prime minister @entity13 and the @entity15 leader @entity14 both accepted the challenge – alongside celebrities @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity0 rejected the chance to wear a ' this is what a feminist looks like ' t - shirt , sparking anger among women 's rights groups it comes after mr @entity0 sparked controversy after being questioned over his support of women			1
last year he was asked by the women ’s magazine @entity33 whether he was a feminist			2
he paused before replying : ‘ i do n’t know what i ’d call myself … it ’s up to others to attach labels			0
but i believe men and women should be treated equally			2
’ he was later forced to explain his remarks			0
he told @entity46 : ‘ when i was asked that question , what i should have said is , if that means equal rights for women , then yes			0
if that is what you mean by feminist , then yes , i am a feminist			0
’ mr @entity14 meanwhile backed the campaign			2
he said : ‘ @entity52 means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won			0
’ @entity13 added : ‘ i support equality and choice – so yes , i ’m a feminist			2
how on earth in this day and age can you not be ? as a wiser person than me once said : “ men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones			0
” ’ when we asked the pm ’s team why he would n’t wear the t - shirt for @entity71 ’s inaugural feminism issue mr @entity0 said he ’d rather give us a quote instead			1
he said : ‘ whether you are a man or a woman , i passionately believe that everyone has a part to play in achieving full equality for women and girls			0
‘ as a parent i feel strongly that my daughters should have the same opportunities as my son			0
as a society we have come a long way in gender equality – but the journey has n’t finished yet , which is why i am committed to doing everything i can do to remove barriers for women and achieve a fairer society			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity13 posed in the t - shirt for the women 's magazine @entity71 labour leader @entity14 said : ' feminism means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won ' @entity71 ’s editor - in - chief @entity96 said : ' we asked the prime minister five times if he would wear the @entity99 ’s @entity102 slogan t - shirt and send us a snapshot ( it would only take 10 minutes )			1
five times , he declined			0
‘ this is a shame on so many levels , especially given he knew @entity13 and @entity14 had agreed without hesitation , alongside many other influential men who were more than happy to call themselves feminists			1
it seems the prime minister still has an issue with the word “ feminist ”			0
’ @entity113 , of the women ’s rights group the @entity99 , said : ‘ we are very pleased the leaders of the @entity117 ’s three main political parties have publicly pledged their support for advancing equality between women and men , and have endorsed the @entity71 x whistles for @entity124 collaboration , which has relaunched @entity124 ’s @entity102 t - shirt			1
‘ however , we understand making a personal commitment to the cause of feminism is a matter for the individual to decide			0
as it stands , it would appear that @entity0 is not comfortable with identifying himself with the cause of feminism , which , given the huge contribution the feminist movement has made to advancing women ’s rights , is unfortunate			1
’ a report last year by @entity138 and @entity139 found the @entity140 lagging behind @entity15 among female voters			2
and in 2011 mr @entity0 was accused of having a ‘ patronising and outdated attitude to women ’ when he told @entity15 mp @entity142 to ‘ calm down dear ’ during a @entity144 debate			1
@entity138 chief executive @entity147 said : ‘ it ’s a shame @entity0 seems wary of calling himself a feminist when all it really means is advocating equal rights and opportunities for women			1

@entity68 is ' uncomfortable ' with using the label women 's groups claimed today
