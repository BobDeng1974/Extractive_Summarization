@entity0 is n’t the type of man to look backwards when looking forwards is available			1
to find the early reasons why his immediate future is log jammed with problems , though , we do need to look over our shoulders , back to a time when @entity10 were winning trophies and widening cracks were being covered by shiny silver and gold paper			1
that was when today ’s troubles really started at @entity17 , back in the glorious days of sir @entity18			1
it sounds ungrateful to say it ; impertinent , rude and sacrilegious			0
but it ’s true , nevertheless			0
@entity10 continued to win trophies during @entity18 ’s latter years at @entity10 but the future , it transpires , was not adequately being taken care of			1
this is the future that @entity26 has inherited and one reason why the current @entity10 manager has arrived at @entity17 to find a squad so desperately short of quality			1
frustrated figure : @entity10 manager @entity0 watches his side lose 4 - 0 to @entity33 game over : @entity33 striker @entity35 scores his side 's fourth goal of the night to shock @entity10 final triumph : sir @entity18 holds the 2012 - 13 @entity40 trophy shortly before retiring tuesday night ’s embarrassing defeat at @entity42 can not be blamed on one individual			1
it contained dreadful playing errors			0
nevertheless , it is impossible to view the current picture of @entity10 ’s predicament without placing their greatest ever manager somewhere in it as the recruitment statistics of @entity18 ’s last six years in charge make for startling viewing			1
during that time , @entity10 won four @entity40 titles , two @entity56 and a @entity57 as a core of previously and expertly recruited players – @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 - combined seamlessly with the last vestiges of the class of ’ 92 to ensure @entity18 ’s remarkable team remained eminent			1
inspired signing : @entity65 gave @entity10 years of fine performances before leaving for £ 80million captaincy material : @entity66 ( left ) ranks among @entity18 's best acquisitions during his time at @entity10 @entity75 ( £ 17m ) @entity76 ( £ 27m ) @entity77 ( £ 17m ) @entity78 ( £ 7.4m ) @entity79 ( £ 17m ) @entity80 ( £ 2m ) @entity81 ( £ 7m ) @entity82 ( £ 30m ) @entity83 ( £ 3m ) @entity84 ( £ 3m ) @entity85 ( £ 6m ) @entity86 ( £ 7m ) @entity87 ( £ 6m ) @entity88 ( £ 4m ) @entity89 ( £ 15m ) during those last six years , however , @entity18 , despite the restrictions of @entity92 ownership , invested in the region of £ 160m of the club ’s money on a string of players he believed would form the club ’s future			1
some have certainly contributed during better times but none have ultimately endured and this , in hindsight , represents the beginning of a decline exacerbated by @entity108 ’ erratic season last time round			0
between the summer of 2007 and the january of 2013 , @entity18 ’s @entity10 bought @entity75 ( £ 17m ) , @entity76 ( £ 27m ) , @entity77 ( £ 17m ) , @entity78 ( £ 7m ) , @entity79 ( £ 17m ) , @entity80 ( £ 2m ) , @entity81 ( £ 7m ) , @entity82 ( £ 30m ) , @entity83 ( £ 3m ) , @entity84 ( £ 3m ) , @entity85 ( £ 6m ) , @entity86 ( £ 7m ) , @entity87 ( £ 6m ) , @entity88 ( £ 4m ) and @entity89 ( £ 15m )			1
set against those purchases is the arrival of the more successful @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and , of course , @entity117			0
exit door : @entity10 hope to offload midfielder @entity76 ( left ) and sent @entity75 ( right ) on loan to @entity120 unveiling : @entity121 @entity82 poses with his shirt after signing for @entity10 in 2008 big money buy : winger @entity89 was brought in from @entity124 for a fee of £ 15m to question @entity18 ’s legacy in this way is a very uncomfortable thing to do			1
it is more fashionable , more palatable , to blame @entity108 entirely			0
nevertheless it is equally difficult to examine the two lists of players above and ignore the very obvious connection between then and now			2
@entity18 ’s incredible man management skills endured to the end but his judgement in the transfer market seemingly did not			1
during his latter years , @entity10 were winning			2
in reality , though , they were also hanging on as the world changed around them			0
@entity142 retired once and was lured back , eventually quitting for good at the age of 37			0
@entity144 played until he was 40			0
there were reasons for this			0
anybody who saw @entity10 play regularly during that time will have recognised the marginal regression in their football that was not always hidden beneath generally positive results			0
back then , @entity154 and @entity155 were coming on strong and players like @entity157 and @entity158 were never going to hold back the tide on their own			2
the old ones are the best : @entity144 played until he was 40 - @entity142 quit at 37 after a second spell farewell : ferguson waves to the fans after his final match in charge of @entity10 at @entity167 in 2013 senior sources at @entity17 have admitted that the 2013 title , @entity18 ’s last , surprised them			1
they did n’t expect it			0
they had seen the quality of the squad wane			2
a poor summer in the market after @entity108 ’ appointment did n’t help and had @entity26 ’s predecessor inspired his players a little more maybe @entity10 would have squeezed another year out of @entity61 and @entity62			1
regardless of that , @entity26 ’s first challenge now is to arrest this decline and then find first gear			1
certainly , what he has found will have alarmed him			0
the @entity186 coach has inherited , for example , a @entity40 squad without a fully functioning defensive line and he must ask himself how a club of @entity10 ’s standing and stature has allowed that to happen			1
this is why he suggested after tuesday ’s failure at @entity33 that results this season have n’t surprised him			2
@entity26 does do a neat line in sarcasm but this was n’t one of them			1
get him in the engine room : @entity202 should be available against @entity203 on saturday @entity204 joins @entity207 's @entity206 exodus looking ahead to saturday ’s @entity40 game at @entity203 , @entity26 ’s most pressing concern will be his system and how to fit record signing @entity202 in to it			1
just as @entity213 struggled to fit in to @entity108 ’ team last january , so @entity204 does not look a natural fit for the 3 - 4 - 1 - 3 formation that @entity26 has placed so much faith in thus far			2
@entity26 hinted after tuesday ’s game that he may change his tactics and indeed he may have to			2
the 62 - year - old has attempted to engrain the system in all levels of football at @entity10 ’s @entity225 training ground and clearly saw a long - term future in the formation he used to great effect with @entity229 at the @entity230			0
tough times : @entity26 ( centre rear ) looks on as @entity10 are knocked out by @entity33 in the @entity233 already , though , it is looking shot to pieces			2
@entity10 ’s defenders do not look comfortable with it and @entity204 arrives as a player seemingly ready - made to slip in to 4 - 3 - 3			0
@entity26 will surely be a big enough man to perform a volte face if he needs to but any move away from his current formation would leave him with a problem connected not with dented pride but where to play his captain @entity66 and indeed the aforementioned @entity213			2
sketch a @entity10 starting xi on to paper and it will look competitive enough			0
injuries are currently hurting them to the extent that they appear worse than they actually are			0
@entity26 is not fooled , though			2
there are fissions in this squad that will not be solved in one transfer window			0
the cumulative effect of six years of questionable judgement now weighs heavy .			0

@entity0 has arrived at @entity17 to find a squad desperately short of quality
