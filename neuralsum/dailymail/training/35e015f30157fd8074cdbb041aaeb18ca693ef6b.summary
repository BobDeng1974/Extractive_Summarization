by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 16:52 est , 25 june 2012 a no - fly ' zone has been put in place over @entity5 's @entity4 tennis club , for the first time in 10 years			2
the air exclusion zone was last used in 2002 following the september 11 terror attacks in @entity9 the previous year			1
police said the decision to reinstate it follows complaints from the @entity4 about noise			1
however they said a no fly zone would certainly ' help ' with security			0
sniffing out any trouble : a police officer watches as a sniffer dog inspect the courts ahead of the first day at the @entity21 in @entity22 prepared : a line of security guards waits to let the crowds into the @entity26 at @entity27 the zone extends 500ft high and has a 0.75 nautical mile perimeter , superintendent @entity30 , from the @entity31 , told a briefing			1
he said : ' we have had it in previous years although we did not have it last year , there was some noise nuisance from a number of aircraft			2
' it ’s not been driven by security but of course it does help			0
' ' you just do n’t want strange aircraft flying overhead if you can avoid it so from a security point of view it helps but it was not the driver			0
' mr @entity30 said he was aware the world ’s eyes are on @entity5 follows the @entity54 and comes just weeks before the @entity56 tennis tournament is hosted at the same venue			1
police said the decision to reinstate the no fly zone follows complaints from the @entity4 about noise measures : plain - clothes officers are at the south - west @entity22 club , while each person ¿ s bag is searched as they enter he said : ' i am acutely aware that if somebody was to do something untoward here it could well have a knock - on effect on the @entity56			1
police numbers at the grand slam have been increased this year , but mr @entity30 would not reveal how many officers are deployed , and how many more are being used this year , but said the increase was ' appropriate '			1
police are using anti-social behaviour legislation to help disperse gangs of people - including ticket touts - while they also have a list of banned faces who will not be allowed in			0
' there are a number of individuals that have been banned by the club and there are a number of individuals of interest that have been circulated by the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			0
' some of those are stalkers of players , some of them are coaches that have been dismissed , those sorts of things where there have been domestic issues within the tennis world and as a result they are just not welcome at these sorts of events			0
' @entity110 : skies over @entity112 were clear of aircraft today after a no - fly zone was put into place over @entity5 threat : ( left ) @entity117 and ( right ) @entity118 are among dozens of players to have been targetted by stalkers in the past			2
police say they are monitoring ' generic threats ' against players police numbers at the tournament have been increased this year , but a spokesman would not reveal exactly how many officers are deployed he said no specific players have approached the police or club with specific threats this year , but there are “ generic threats ” police are monitoring			1
last year anti-capitalist protesters targeted the tournament , mr @entity30 said , adding that they were not aware of any politically - motivated protests planned for this year , although ' two weeks is a long time '			1
plain - clothes officers are at the south - west @entity22 club , while each person ’s bag is searched as they enter			0
some members of the team in charge of the policing operation at @entity5 will be helping with the security operation during the @entity56 , mr @entity30 said , but it will look ' totally different ' as it is part of a much larger event			2
he added : ' we are always looking to improve our security plan so we do review it and we do make some tactical changes so we can defeat anyone who is trying to do a hostile reconnaissance			0
' the mere fact that the @entity56 are here also means that we have been able to benefit from wider security provisions and we use that to review our plans			0
