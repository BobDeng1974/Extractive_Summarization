my son is ahead of me , his kayak skimming across the slate blue water			1
a battalion of cormorants lands on a tree			2
i pull up my paddle and the air settles around me , as serene as the lake			2
then @entity11 comes shooting across , spraying me with water as he turns on his paddle			2
‘ there ’s a great beach over there			1
’ @entity11 is nearly 16 , and i ’m painfully aware that my years of holidaying with him are coming to a close			2
my last choices all ended in teenage snits			2
then a friend suggested a back - to - nature break in @entity24			1
unknown : @entity25 , in north - east @entity24 , is the furthest outreach of the @entity27 our destination is @entity25 , in the north - east of the country , close to the @entity33 border			1
it is the furthest outreach of the @entity27 ( @entity24 ’s @entity35 ) , and the most sparsely populated			1
our base is an unassuming but pristine hotel right on the @entity39 lakeshore			0
the @entity40 snuggles around it , a mass of primeval forest and waterways that are home to otter and beaver , wolf and elk			0
the area is unspoiled , but it is also exceedingly well set - up for outdoorsy pursuits			1
the hotel rents mountain bikes and nordic walking poles , and you could cycle or hike for days around the well - marked trails			1
come and discover : the area is unspoiled , but it is also exceedingly well set - up for outdoor pursuits or you can take to the water			1
whichever way you turn , there is another beach , another jetty , another twisting corner of @entity39 — the name means ‘ winding ’ — and it has the longest and most meandering shoreline of all of @entity24 ’s lakes			1
the food is solid , verging on stolid , big piles of comfort stacked high and priced low — a lightweight £ 3 a plate			0
we need the calories , with the amount of exercise we are notching up			0
we cycle through the forest , keeping a hopeful eye out for wildlife			0
but we are too noisy , what with our clanking gears and my muffled grunts as i hit yet another tree root			0
a holiday of an old - fashioned kind : @entity92 found a refreshing simplicity to this pretty corner of @entity24 it is all so wholesome that , as we sit by another pristine lake , watching the sun dip down , i find myself singing old campfire songs as @entity11 takes another swim			1
the place has somehow transported me back to my own teens , to a time when holidays did not need to be sophisticated			0
‘ you know what ? i ’ve loved this holiday , ’ says @entity11 , as we sit for the last time on the hotel jetty , sharing a bar of chocolate and watching the stars			0
‘ me too , ’ i tell him			0
a wealth of water and wow factor : @entity92 chose the region for an active holiday with her teenage son @entity118 ( 0871 246 0000 , www.ryanair.com ) flies from @entity120 to @entity121 from £ 49 return			0
double rooms at the @entity124 , @entity125 ( 0048 87 563 59 59 , www.hotelnadwigrami.pl ) cost from £ 50 per night @entity127			0
mountain bikes and kayaks can be hired			0

@entity24 **'s** cities are *tourism* *favourites* - but its @entity35 is less known
@entity25 , in the north - east , is one of @entity24 **'s** prettiest areas
encompassing part of the @entity27 , it is great for family breaks
