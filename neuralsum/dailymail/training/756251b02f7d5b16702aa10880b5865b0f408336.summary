some people wo n't touch food or drink that 's just a day or two past its best - before date			0
but when some divers found a 72 - year - old bottle of coffee beans in a ship wreck , they could n't resist brewing up with them â€“ and they were amazed that they made a hot beverage with one hull of a taste			1
the beans were brought up from the wreck of the @entity14 , a @entity16 cargo ship which was sunk in @entity17 after being struck by a @entity19 torpedo during the @entity20			1
water discovery : divers found a bottle of coffee beans in the wreck of the @entity14 , a @entity16 cargo ship which was sunk in @entity17 after being struck by a @entity19 torpedo during the @entity20 examination : a diver holding the bottle of coffee beans that had been brought to the surface from the wreck despite the ship 's violent end , the bottle of beans was salvaged with the stopper still in place			1
not content with making the extraordinary find , the divers who explored the 545 - foot - long vessel decided to open the bottle and brew up the cup of coffee the world had waited 72 years to experience			1
photographer and diver @entity45 , 42 , said : ' we brought up a dark green bottle , which had been floating near the ceiling of the mess cabin			1
' we could hear something moving around inside the bottle , like beads			0
when we opened it up , we could smell the bitter aroma of coffee			0
brewing up : coffee beans from the wreck being poured into a coffee grinder ( left ) and being distributed , ready to be put to the test ( right ) taste test : two divers slurp some of the coffee , which they described as being ' remarkably fresh ' , ' very rich ' but with a taste that was ' overcooked ' ' we ground the beans and made coffee with them			1
the coffee was remarkably fresh , despite its age			0
the taste was n't perfect but it was one of the most memorable coffee breaks of my life			1
' the coffee smelled very rich			1
the fact it had been underwater in a sealed jar meant it came with an amazing backstory , so the taste was unique and very special			0
i would describe the taste as overcooked , as if it had been left to stew for a long time			0
' the @entity14 is so perfectly preserved due to its depth			2
it lies at 72 feet below the surface - the height of four double - decker buses - protecting it from the impact of waves			0
other ships from the same period which were scuppered at a depth of 40 to 50 feet have been broken apart in winter storms			0
divers also found lightbulbs from the forsaken vessel which they managed to hook up to an electricity supply and bring back to life			2

' we brought some of the lightbulbs up from the wreck , cleaned them of salt and connected them to a light fitting			2
they still light up , despite having been under a pressure two or three times that of the atmosphere for more than seven decades			0
' although the @entity14 was primarily a cargo ship there were 16 first - class cabins on board and it had a well - stocked wine cellar			1
toilets in the wreck : according to the divers the flush and other faucets still worked a sink on the floor of the wreck , which still had taps that turned easily , according to the divers mr @entity45 said : ' when we discovered the wine cellar we rubbed our hands in anticipation			2
' my co-divers dug in the silt for days , only to be rewarded by several broken or empty bottles which smashed when it sank			0
the bottles we did manage to salvage had not aged well and now contained a strong grape vinegar			0
' the @entity14 , which was built in 1939 in @entity145 , @entity146 , sank on may 29 1942 after joining the @entity16 naval fleet at the start of @entity20			1
the cargo ship was part of a convoy of @entity16 and @entity153 ships travelling from @entity154 , @entity16 to @entity155 , @entity156			1
the @entity14 was carrying coal and ammunition			2
a diver examines the crest on the ships bow , which rests 72 feet beneath the surface near the port of @entity164 the ship was hit at 9.30pm by a torpedo fired by a @entity19 submarine			1
the captain , @entity168 , had previously been alerted to foam trails in the water thought to be from a submarine periscope			0
the @entity14 tried evasive manoeuvres but the ship was struck below the waterline on the starboard side			1
@entity175 flooded into the engine room so quickly that three mechanics on watch drowned before they could leave their posts			0
in total 31 @entity16 and 56 @entity153 were rescued from the vessel before it finally sank seven miles from the port of @entity164 .			0
