by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 17:07 est , 23 november 2013 although he will be 80 in march , conductor sir @entity1 shows no signs of slowing down			1
his engagements diary is booked three years in advance and he travels worldwide to conduct 50 concerts a year			1
as well as all this , there is his annual stint at the @entity9 , where he has taken to the podium for the past 30 years			1
now he also has to organise the sale of his house – a late @entity14 gem near @entity15 in @entity16 , on the market at £ 2,995,000 , which he has only recently finished renovating			1
yet he makes light of his busy schedule			2
impressive estate : sir @entity1 and his wife bought @entity22 , which has seven bedrooms , as well as four one - bedroom flats and three cottages , 17 years ago ‘ buying this property was a family venture , ’ he says			1
‘ now there are fewer of us , the place is too big – it ’s like a snail ’s shell stuck to my back			2
’ sir @entity1 and his choreographer wife @entity36 , 61 , bought @entity22 17 years ago			1
it was big enough to enable them to install @entity36 ’s mother and stepfather in one of three cottages in the grounds and make a steady income from letting the four one - bedroom flats attached to the house			1
however , what attracted them to the property most was its potential as a restoration project			2
@entity52 was then a rather sad and gloomy hotel , but sir @entity1 saw the chance to transpose his musical beliefs into interior design			1
‘ follow the exact instructions of @entity60 in 1810 and the music somehow sounds modern , ’ says sir @entity1 , whose musical trademark is performing classical works exactly as they would have sounded when written			1
‘ similarly with a house – just show up what was originally there and it lives again			2
’ the couple had previously restored a 17th century cottage in nearby @entity67			2
however , @entity68 , with its fawlty-esque odour of failure , had been more thoughtlessly fouled up			0
big project : sir @entity1 has spent a majority of the time living at @entity68 renovating the @entity14 gem standing in the magnificent drawing room , with its views over the @entity76 , @entity36 points out the minuscule attention to detail they have brought to the restoration			1
every plastic light switch has been taken out and replaced with @entity14 brass fittings ; @entity14 bell pushes are now in place ; the fireplaces , one in every room , have been restored ; faded wallpaper has been replaced with silk fabric inserts between panelling ; cornicing has been freshly coloured with gold leaf			0
that is quite apart from the major structural repairs – the rewiring , new roofing , replumbing and new copper gutters			0
it all took 15 years , and when i enquire about the price of the works , sir @entity1 replies simply : ‘ do n’t ask ! ’ the drawing room opens into the dining room and along the corridor there is sir @entity1 ’s study , with its baby grand piano , floor - to - ceiling bookcases and imposing desk			1
it ’s only when you see upstairs – where , apart from the four flats , there are seven bedrooms with dressing rooms and bathrooms – that you truly appreciate the size of this house			2
did sir @entity1 regret , i wonder , taking time out a few years ago to appear on @entity121 , a television series involving eight celebrities , including @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , competing against one another to find the best conductor ? veteran in the game : sir @entity1 has been conducting the @entity132 at the @entity9 for three decades ‘ no – i loved it , ’ he says			1
‘ a lot of people learned a lot from it about classical music			0
the winner , @entity139 , was extremely good			0
’ he is remarkably unstuffy , and any talk about conducting is infused with self - deprecation			0
‘ the great conductors – and i do n’t consider myself one – have supernatural powers , ’ he says			0
‘ i just use my eyes and gestures and shout , “ play in tune , you b * * * * * * s ! ” ’ it ’s little wonder that sir @entity1 is regarded with such affection by orchestras			1
his warmest memories of @entity68 are of the times when the entire @entity155 – 100 musicians – visited for lunch parties in his five acres of grounds			0
‘ orchestras do n’t usually socialise with their conductor , which is silly , ’ he says			2
‘ they have come three times and each time was marvellous			0
we have a hog roast and a jazz band plays			0
’ much of the countryside surrounding the house is shown in a gigantic mural in the hallway , covering three walls			0
one direction looks towards @entity173 and the spires of the university city are exaggerated so as to stand out			0
the artist the @entity177 commissioned to create the mural even included a tiny depiction of sir @entity1 in a boat on the @entity180			1
the death of @entity36 ’s mother and her stepfather ’s move into a care home led to the sale			2
but who will buy it ? ‘ maybe some international businessman or rich rock star , ’ says @entity36			0
‘ it ’s handy for @entity192 and the airports and big enough for an entourage , staff and an extended family			0
’ @entity197 , 020 3641 5162			0

proms conductor sir @entity1 is selling his £ 2,995,000 home
he has spend more than 15 years renovating @entity22
