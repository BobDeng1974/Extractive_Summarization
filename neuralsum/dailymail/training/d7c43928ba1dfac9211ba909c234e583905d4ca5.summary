@entity1 bus drivers in @entity2 are to strike because their new uniform trousers are too tight			1
the 1,600 workers at the @entity6 public transport company have announced their plans for a 24 - hour walkout in june over the quality , colour and fit of the trousers			1

the 1,600 drivers at the state - run @entity6 in @entity2 are to walk out in june over their new uniforms @entity22 , leader of the @entity24 transport union , said : ' we reject the bottom half of this new uniform , which is the same colour as the @entity28 [ @entity1 police ] wear			1
' the employees do n't want to wear a uniform that was chosen unilaterally by the management , without taking into account the views of our clothing committee			2
' and one bus driver told the city 's @entity38 newspaper : ' i wo n't be wearing them			2
they make us look like we work for the @entity44 ! car repair company			0
' the shirts are alright , but these trousers are far too tight			0
