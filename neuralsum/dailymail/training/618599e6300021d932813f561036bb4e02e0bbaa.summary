by @entity0 suspect : @entity2 's lawyers have argued that the attack 's emotional impact will prevent their client from getting a fair trial @entity7 bomber @entity2 has made a second push to move his trial from the city after arguing that residents have already made up their minds he is guilty			1
the 21 - year - old 's lawyers say the emotional impact of the deadly attack means people living in @entity19 have ' an overwhelming presumption of guilt ' towards their client			1
in a document handed to the court on thursday they claim a defence expert who analysed poll results and media coverage found there was little chance of @entity2 getting a fair trial in @entity7			1
against the wishes of the prosecution , defence lawyers are now pushing to move the november trial to @entity34 for the second time , where they say poll results show people are less likely to be prejudiced			1
if that is not granted , they will ask the court to hold a pretrial hearing on their request			0
@entity2 , 21 , is awaiting trial for the horrific attack , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the @entity47 finish line on april 15 2013			1
three days after the bombing , the @entity48 identified @entity51 brothers @entity2 and @entity52 as suspects and released pictures of the pair			2

prosecutors say he and his brother , @entity52 , placed two pressure - cooker bombs near the finish line in the callous attack			0
in their original change of venue motion , filed in june , @entity2 's lawyers said a survey of potential jurors in @entity7 , @entity82 , @entity19 , @entity83 and @entity34 suggested that the nation 's capital would be a more suitable location for the trial			1
@entity52 was killed in a gun - fight with police several days after the bombing - both he and his brother , @entity2 , are suspected of the devastating attack they said @entity7 residents were the ' most prejudiced ' on a number of critical measures , based on the preliminary findings of a survey conducted in may			1
their new filing adds more supporting details			0
