by @entity0 the parents of a severely ill baby girl are threatening to take legal action after an ethics committee ruled that doctors can withdraw her breathing support - a move they fear will end her life			1
@entity10 was diagnosed with @entity11 - an rare neurodegenerative disorder - in december last year			1
her mother and father were told that only a ' handful ' of cases have ever been diagnosed worldwide and , with no known cure for the condition , @entity10 was given just 12 months to live			2
in march this year , medical staff , with the support of @entity10 's parents , drew up an end of life care plan , which stated that @entity10 would not be transferred to @entity24 if she suffered a seizure or became more ill. @entity26 and her partner are threatening to take legal action after an ethics committee ruled that doctors can withdraw their daughter @entity31 's breathing support - a move they fear will end her life it was agreed that she would not receive breathing support if she contracted a cold or picked up a hospital bug - a decision which her parents are fighting to change			1
@entity10 's mother @entity41 said : ' because @entity10 's condition is terminal and she was expected to deteriorate rapidly , we did n't want her to suffer and so we agreed to it			2
' but she is doing so well and we are all surprised at how stable she is			0
' based on what the doctors told us , we did n't think she 'd be here now but she is			2
' she 's progressing , she knows who we are and she smiles and we think it 's unfair to stick to the life plan when you look at how far she 's come			2
' i think the ethical committee sees breathing support or treatment in @entity24 as prolonging death not encouraging life			1
' the hospital staff are concerned about us too because we have been living in the hospital and have n't even been home since september			2
' they said that it 's a burden for us and it 's too much for anybody to bear but that 's not the case			0
' we just want what 's best for @entity10 and , after seeing how well she 's doing , i 'm no longer comfortable with the end of life care plan			1
' if she catches even just a cold it could affect her breathing and if she does n't get the support she needs that could be it			1
' to lose her to something as small as that after everything she 's been through is n't right			0
' i feel sick with worry every time she gets a sniffle			0
' there 's so many bugs in hospital she could easily pick something up			2
' we want to give her a fighting chance and that 's why we are doing everything in our power to get the life plan changed			2
' the 23 - month - old suffers from a rare condition which means she requires constant breathing assistance according to the plan , if @entity10 's condition deteriorates , she will not receive breathing support and will only be treated with antibiotics			1
after demanding a review of the plan , the ethical committee held a meeting two weeks ago to discuss whether changes should be made if @entity10 takes a turn for the worse			2
@entity26 and her partner @entity99 , 34 , a groundworker , said they will find out the final ruling on monday but said the committee recommended at the time that the plan stays in place			0
@entity26 said : ' we are waiting to hear for certain on monday but we are ready to fight this in the courts if we need to			0
' i do n't want to think about fighting people during what could be the last few months of @entity10 's life			0
' i do n't want to think about fighting people during what could be the last few months of @entity10 's life			0
i 'm really upset because i do n't want to remember her last months like this ' - @entity41 , @entity10 's mother ' i 'm really upset because i do n't want to remember her last months like this			0
' i want to enjoy my time with @entity10 while we 've got it			0
' a spokesman from @entity120 , told the @entity122 : ' as a specialist children ’s hospital , @entity120 treats many children with complex , life threatening illnesses			1
' sadly , despite receiving the very best expertise and care , some children are unable to recover from their illness or condition			1
' in such a situation , medical professionals will meet to discuss the most appropriate care plan going forward , focusing on the comfort and wellbeing of the child concerned			1
' for every child this is discussed in full with the family before an agreement is reached about the most appropriate ongoing care needed for that child			1
' if an agreement between clinicians and parents can not be reached , the case is taken before a @entity149 to enable a judge to decide			1
the ruling is yet to be confirmed in writing , but miss @entity41 and mr @entity153 are in further limbo after @entity10 stopped breathing on monday night and was sent to @entity155 , with extra breathing support			1
her parents @entity41 , 29 , and partner @entity153 ( pictured with @entity10 ) are threatening legal action as they believe , while @entity10 , affectionately known as @entity159 , is seriously ill , she still has quality of life miss @entity41 said : ' @entity10 stopped breathing and her main consultant was called in from home and we talked			1
' we both agreed that if @entity10 did n’t start breathing properly on her own she would go to @entity24			0
' this goes against what they had decided previously			0
' as it stands , the life plan is being adjusted to say that depending on the situation and cause , @entity24 is n't completely ruled out			1
' it ’s more of a compromise			0
but the ethics committee ruling still stands and we are due to look over their decision in writing on monday			1
' sadly , despite receiving the very best expertise and care , some children are unable to recover from their illness or condition ' - spokesman for @entity120 ' the feeling is that the team is divided in their opinions as to what ’s best and not just disagreeing with me			1
' i ’m confused because what happened last night is what i asked them to do in the first place			0
' but i ’m happier with the plan as it is now because i know they will consider upping her support in situations like that			0
' i have no idea what ’s going to happen still but we are still talking with the medics and i ’m currently still only receiving legal advice over the phone			0
' a hospital spokeswoman added : ' the trust is unable to comment on individual cases			0
' we understand that this is an ongoing , highly sensitive case and we continue to liaise closely with the family concerned			0
