a comet hurtling into our solar system from deep space could next year score a direct and cataclysmic impact on @entity6 , astronomers say			1
according to current calculations , comet @entity7 ( @entity7 ) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the @entity6			1
but the unpredictable nature of comet orbits , which can change as jet - like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the @entity21 , means it could pass further away , or veer into a direct collision course			1
incoming ! a computer generated image shows how a comet might look from the surface of @entity6			2
a recently discovered comet could be on course for a cataclysmic impact with the surface of the @entity6 respected astronomer @entity29 , author of @entity32 's @entity31 blog , has calculated that even if the comet is just nine miles across - a low estimate - an impact with @entity6 would cause a one billion megaton explosion			1
that , he says , is 25million times larger than the largest nuclear weapon ever tested on @entity39			0
much more likely , however , is that the comet will just miss @entity6 , which will nevertheless mean that the planet will pass through the cloud of sublimating gas spewed from the visiting rock as it draws closer to the @entity21 like asteroids , comets are large chunks of space rock that orbit around our solar system			1
unlike asteroids , however , comets are packed with ice			0
this ice is not necessarily just water , but also things like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide that on @entity39 we generally think of as gases , which in the chilly reaches of space are frozen inside the nucleus of the comet			0
as the comet hurtles along its orbit closer to the @entity21 , these substances turn directly from solids to gases , often erupting from the comet through geyser - like vents			0
the comet 's trajectory : astronomers have calculated that , according to its present orbit ( indicated in blue ) , c / 2012 @entity7 will make its closest approach to @entity6 in october 2014 at the moment , @entity7 is over a billion kilometres from the @entity21 , somewhere past @entity80 , which means it is still very cold			1
however , as it draws closer it will began to vent more gas , changing its path and surrounding the nucleus with a large fuzzy cloud known as a coma - which can be up to several hundred thousand kilometres across			0
that means that the comet 's coma - which is also filled with grit - like rubble from the comet itself - could be bigger than the distance the nucleus is predicted to miss @entity6			2
' if that does happen , it ’ll be the gods ’ own meteor shower for the @entity6 , ' @entity29 writes			0
it will also be interesting to see the effect of the grit shower on @entity6 's two lumpy , potato - shaped moons , @entity100 and @entity101 , which would be peppered with grit as the comet streaks past			2
images of @entity7 captured by the @entity105 on january 20 : although it was still over a billion kilometres from the @entity21 when this image was taken it already shows a small amount of coma activity and if the nucleus does hit @entity6 , the effect would be apocalyptic for the planet			1
estimates for the size of the comet 's core range from nine to 30 miles across , and astronomers say it will be moving at a phenomenal speed of 120,000mph upon impact - giving it huge kinetic energy			2
such an impact would leave a scar on @entity6 hundreds of kilometres across , says @entity29			1
even worse for @entity39 - based observers , it would almost certainly destroy all our probes in orbit around and on the surface of the planet			0
' the ejecta would come screaming off the planet and sent every which way in orbit around @entity6 , ' @entity29 writes			0
' it would be like orbiting into a shotgun blast			0
' @entity138 / 2013 @entity7 was first spotted on january 3 , making it the first comet to be discovered this year			1
@entity140 of its orbit predict it will make its closest approach to @entity6 in october next year .			0

@entity138 / 2013 @entity7 could pass within 23,000 miles of @entity6 in october 2014
but the unpredictable nature of comet orbits mean it could veer closer
if it hit the planet it would leave a *crater* hundreds of kilometres across
huge blast would destroy all probes on and around the @entity6
