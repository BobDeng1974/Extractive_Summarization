a weekend fight involving nearly every member of the @entity3 family was actually started by the infamous politician and her brood , this according to numerous eyewitnesses			1
the @entity3 pack apparently had a run - in with @entity8 , an ex-boyfriend of @entity10 , 20 , at a birthday party on saturday evening , and that was when all hell broke loose			1
according to multiple witnesses at the party , oldest @entity3 son @entity14 , 25 , traded blows with his sister 's ex on the front lawn of the party , and when @entity8 's father @entity22 tried to break the boys up , @entity3 began to choke him			1
@entity3 ended up walking away with a bloody nose			2
birthday boy : the @entity3 family was celebrating the birthday of family friend @entity44 a source said the failed vice-presidential candidate was ' nearly crawling on top of people ' to get involved in the fight			1
the party , meanwhile , was not for @entity3 , who did turn 50 on saturday , but rather for twins @entity51 and @entity44 , who are close friends of the @entity3 family			1
once the fight finally broke up , @entity10 and big sister @entity54 , 23 , who apparently spent the entire evening wearing sunglasses as they strolled around the party , tried to start things up all over again , by going after @entity61 's mother , @entity60			1
' they were on a b - line , coming straight at @entity60 , ' said partygoer @entity64			0
they were stopped by the host of the party however , @entity67 , who politely asked them to leave			2
so @entity54 started punching him in the face			1
@entity64 told political blogger @entity70 ' stood straight up , brought her arm back and cold - cocked [ @entity67 ] right in the face			0
' she did this six more times before @entity67 was able to push her off him			0
' i was thoroughly amazed at the restraint @entity79 showed			0
he ’s a total gentlemen , ' @entity64 said			0
sister sister : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) apparently tried to go after the mother of @entity10 's ex-boyfriend a victim and a gentleman : host @entity67 ( above ) was punched in the face seven times by @entity54 when he politely asked her to leave the party then , @entity38 got involved all over again and began to scream profanities at everyone			1
this morning , @entity64 told @entity90 , ' i heard @entity38 scream out , " you know who we are , do n’t you ? " ' finally , to cap it all off , @entity14 stood out in front of the house with his shirt off and his middle finger raised at those who were leaving shortly after this the fighting stopped , and the @entity103 got in their car for the evening , a stretch @entity106 , and left			2
no sooner had the @entity103 left then the police showed up to take statements from some of the remaining guests			0

she then added , ‘ alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident			0

' i was traveling yesterday , so i 'm posting @entity3 's 50th birthday greeting a day late , which is fine because the handsome guy barely looks a day over 50 , ' she wrote on sunday evening			1
