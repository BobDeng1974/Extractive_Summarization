by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 26 june 2013 glum : @entity2 seen leaving the rented @entity3 flat where she has been staying since her husband was pictured throttling her in a restaurant when she moved out , her husband played down photographs of him grabbing her by the throat and tweaking her nose at a restaurant as a ‘ playful tiff ’			2
but @entity2 appeared yesterday to have dashed any hopes @entity13 may have that their marriage can be reconciled			1
she sent a van to take away not just her clothes but also her precious cookery utensils and recipe books – everything , it seems , but the kitchen sink			0
the arrival of the removal team at the £ 14million marital home in @entity24 was the clearest sign yet that the tv chef ’s marriage split may be permanent			1
they appeared in the middle of the afternoon , evidently while @entity30 was out			2
under the direction of miss @entity2 ’s sister @entity33 , they trooped in and out of the house removing box after box , including ones labelled ‘ cookbooks ’ and ‘ kitchen ’ as well as a food processor , clothes and paintings			2
other items including miss @entity2 ’s weights and exercise ball , dresses , hats , toys , toiletries and even a bag of wrapping paper were loaded into the van			1
one box contained a can labelled cannabis – which despite the alarming name is a legal energy drink containing hemp extract			0
miss @entity2 was not seen and @entity30 turned up only after the process was complete			1
there were so many possessions that the removal team made two runs			0
one onlooker said he had been told that some statues had been removed earlier in the day			0
‘ it looked very much like @entity2 is moving all of her personal possessions out of the house – and is n’t going to be back in a hurry , ’ he said			0
many items were apparently taken to a storage facility while the rest were taken to an address some seven miles away in south - west @entity73 where miss @entity2 appears to be setting up home			1
she was spotted yesterday with @entity75 , her 17 - year - old son from her first marriage , before heading back to the £ 10,000 - a - week @entity3 flat where she has been staying			0
the 53 - year - old has been seen there several times looking drawn and without her wedding ring , and while her two children and sister have visited , there has been no sign of her husband of ten years			0
moving out : miss @entity2 's keep - fit equipment is packed into the van , along with bags and her @entity91 guitar ... ... not forgetting the collection of summer hats and boxes of items , including a can of @entity97 seems to be a permanent decision : workers trooped in and out of the house removing box after box , including ones labelled ‘ cookbooks ’ and ‘ kitchen ’ as well as a food processor , clothes and paintings @entity30 , 70 , has accepted a police caution for assault for the scenes that provoked their split , despite playing it down			1
the advertising tycoon turned modern art mogul was photographed grabbing miss @entity2 by the throat and tweaking her nose outside @entity119 restaurant in central @entity73 during an extraordinary 27 - minute incident three sundays ago			1
when miss @entity2 left home after the photos were published a week later , @entity30 claimed he had simply suggested she moved out to wait for ‘ the dust to settle ’			1
he initially tried to explain the throat - grabbing as a ‘ playful tiff ’			0
when further pictures of him twisting miss @entity2 ’s nose emerged , he said he had merely been trying to clean her nose			2
miss @entity2 ’s spokesman last night continued to refuse to comment either on the assault incident or on the state of her marriage			2
but moving her belongings to a different house would appear to signal the start of a divorce between the millionaire celebrity chef and @entity30 , who is said to have a fortune of up to £ 100million .			0

move seems to dash hopes of *reconciliation* with husband @entity13
removal van came to @entity30 's £ 14million home yesterday afternoon
miss @entity2 was not seen and @entity30 turned up only after they finished
