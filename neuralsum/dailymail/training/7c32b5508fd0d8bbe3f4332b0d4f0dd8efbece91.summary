@entity1 already have his national team - mate @entity30 on their books after the 16 - year - old impressed on trial , now @entity25 , who has dual @entity35 nationality and is 6ft 3in , hopes to have a similar impact			1
one to be taken with a pinch of salt maybe but the rumours circling the corridors at the @entity42 are that @entity18 may be ready to sanction the sale of @entity16 following the purchase of @entity45 and @entity46			1
unthinkable , perhaps but @entity47 will come into the reasoning			2
@entity49 is poised to join @entity50 as the financial sacrifice for @entity45 but @entity50 say they can only do a loan with £ 47m following next summer			2
@entity16 is the darling of @entity18 and although approaching 30 and picking up injuries , he still carries more goals for the side than his illustrious team - mates			1
he scored 56 goals in 49 appearances for club and country last season and that still wo n't come cheap even at 29			0
commercially , he is a huge money - maker for the club and any departure may still be a year away			1
waving goodbye ? @entity16 is the darling of @entity18 , but the @entity69 could consider selling him @entity70 continue to hold interest in @entity72 , who is not wholly content with life at @entity1			1

@entity102 side @entity101 , who recently agreed to sell @entity104 to @entity105 , are also interested but do n't want to pay above £ 2.5million			1
it was initially thought the 28 - year old @entity107 was free to leave @entity100 following the west @entity110 club 's relegation from the @entity111 but @entity98 want a fee to compensate paying his £ 70,000 a week wages in recent seasons			1
in black and white : @entity94 have made a move for @entity98 's @entity97 - @entity101 are also interested shanghai were keen to make @entity97 a marquee signing and despite the player being interested in leaving @entity98 , he wo n't be going to @entity120			1
he told @entity121 : ' i will try to get in at @entity123			0
i do n't think it 's going to be easy this business , but i really would like to play there			0
' i really would like a change and @entity123 is a very important club			0
' @entity97 joined @entity98 from @entity129 in july 2012 but has scored just nine goals in 50 appearances in all competitions			2
his other option is to sit it out at @entity98 and sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign side in january			0
@entity129 are chasing @entity137 forward @entity138			0
the 22 - year - old @entity140 star has been a target for @entity142 in recent weeks but @entity143 has expressed an interest with a likely deal costing £ 1.75m			1
@entity137 are willing to let @entity138 go as they continue to pursue targets such as @entity148 at @entity149			0
@entity138 , who is 6ft 3in tall , has 12 goals in 34 internationals for @entity140			0
@entity129 also remain keen on a loan for @entity86 midfielder @entity153			0
centre of attention : @entity137 's @entity138 is wanted by @entity129 and the @entity156 are willing to let him leave main man : @entity83 are hopeful of landing @entity158 @entity83 believe they are in prime position to sign @entity158 from @entity161 - but they still have to agree a fee			1
saints are happy to sell their record buy but want a decent return on heir £ 15m			1
@entity83 have been linked with a raft of strikers including @entity86 's @entity85 and @entity84 of @entity28			0
they have made offers but most entail initial loan proposals with fees to follow in a year 's time			2
that is indicative of their offer to @entity176 for @entity177			0
while they have asked to pay £ 9m next season , @entity178 have offered £ 10m now for the @entity181 midfielder			2
it means clubs are holding out for better offers but @entity161 do want a quick resolution to @entity158 's future			0

tough time : @entity210 has failed to make an impression at @entity86 and is wanted by @entity212 @entity86 winger @entity210 is wanted by @entity212			0
the 25 - year - old had a successful spell on loan at @entity216 last season and is wanted by @entity218 but that particular deal has stalled			1
@entity212 sporting director @entity220 is a fan of @entity221 who excelled with @entity222 in the @entity223 prior to his unproductive move to @entity86			0
another @entity86 youngster , 20 - year - old @entity227 @entity226 is wanted on loan by @entity80			1
@entity86 striker @entity228 has been training with former club @entity229 to regain his fitness ahead of a return to full - time training with the @entity110 outfit next week			2

another starlet there that @entity111 clubs are looking at is 16 - year - old @entity242			1
@entity79 , @entity243 , @entity216 , @entity244 and @entity245 have all sent scouts to watch the @entity248 striker who is a tireless worker as well as promising goalscorer			0
thumbs up : @entity86 striker @entity228 has been training with former club @entity229 to regain his fitness @entity251 's recruitment drive has had more twists and turns than a fairground rollercoaster			0
it is only replicated by the on - off nature of @entity258 's managerial status			2
the @entity75 was understood to have decided to leave the club on tuesday but is still there as confusion reigns around the club			0

one that may arrive is another goalkeeper @entity267			2

in a colourful career , he has played at @entity274 , @entity94 , @entity275 and @entity277 side @entity276 but he is happy to join the chaos at @entity279 .			2

@entity1 hopeful deal for @entity2 will be completed by the weekend
goalkeeper will head to @entity1 for £ 3m after @entity6 joined @entity3
