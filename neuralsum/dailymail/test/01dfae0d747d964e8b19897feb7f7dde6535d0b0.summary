watching @entity1 enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider and a chat with the locals in a @entity9 pub garden , it is hard to believe that only three years ago he was virtually scared to leave the safety of his @entity12 office			1
he felt besieged and intimidated			2
there was little evidence his hardline ‘ austerity @entity16 ’ policies were working			1
his nervy demeanour and pallid complexion reflected the sickly economy			2
in the eyes of critics he was a hate figure – and it was getting to him			2
‘ it ’s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically , and i got myself into a position where i was hunkered down in the @entity12 , ’ @entity1 drinks a pint of @entity9 cider as he is interviewed by political editor @entity30 at @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity9 @entity1 reflects as we chat at the @entity34 in @entity32 during a break in an election campaign tour of the @entity37			1
‘ i was saying , look , if people do n’t like the plan or whatever , well , you know … so be it			2
’ the nadir came when the chancellor was booed at the @entity44			1
worse , it happened in front of his children , @entity45 and @entity46 , now aged 13 and 11			2
did he feel he could n’t take any more ? ‘ i never personally felt , erm , low , ’ he says slowly , giving a rare glimpse of his emotions			2
‘ but i ’m not going to pretend it was easy			2
‘ the most difficult thing was explaining it to my children – it ’s not an easy conversation to have			2
’ @entity1 has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the @entity44 to being credited with helping to turn @entity16 's economy around @entity1 did not consider throwing in the towel , but he knew that he had to break out of his @entity12 bunker			1
‘ i thought , hold on , you can not do this in this job – you have to go out and explain yourself , meet people , expose yourself to fresh ideas			0
’ he gestures with outstretched arms , hands clenched , recalling the moment he got a grip			0
since then , confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the chancellor himself			0
and he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically			0
he went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st			0
on the day of our interview , a national newspaper compared the new - look @entity1 to dashing @entity82 heart - throb actor @entity81 – quite a change from the days when he was derided as a regency fop			1
‘ it ’s definitely moving in the right direction ! ’ he laughs			0
more waspish and engaging than @entity87 in private , @entity1 has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public			1
it is one of the reasons he stood aside when @entity87 ran for the @entity93 leadership			0
he is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat – a basic skill required by modern leaders			0
his sense of isolation in his early days as chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife @entity106 ’s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in @entity109 instead of moving to @entity110			0
they thought it would make it easier to preserve a ‘ normal ’ family life			0
‘ i never saw the kids or @entity106 , because i was up so early and back late , ’ @entity1 says			1
his morale improved dramatically when the family did move into @entity110 , one of the few u-turns @entity1 has made			1
‘ i see the children all the time now , in the morning , and i can pop up in the early afternoon if i ’m going out in the evening , ’ he says cheerily			0
‘ i feel very lucky			0
’ @entity1 also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying @entity16 under @entity124 will mimic @entity126 's course since it voted in socialist @entity127 as president @entity1 ’s tour of the @entity130 has been designed to target seats where the @entity132 are fighting the @entity133			1
at @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 , to promote the government ’s apprenticeship scheme , the chancellor was shown by 17 - year - old trainee mechanic @entity140 how to drain a car sump			0
@entity1 ’s hand ended up drenched in oil			1
if he had been asked to do it in his ‘ hunkered down ’ phase he would have found it torture			0
here , with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls , it was n’t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as @entity140 passed him a spanner			0
from @entity136 it was back to @entity9 and @entity156 , where @entity1 hopes the @entity93 candidate will unseat @entity133 @entity158 who was , until two weeks ago , a @entity160 colleague			1
@entity1 was such a fan of @entity158 that when the @entity160 was formed in 2010 , he made @entity161 his deputy , stating that he was ‘ put on earth to be treasury chief secretary ’			1
‘ well , he did n’t last long in that position ! ’ hoots @entity1 with a fiendish grin			1
laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an @entity169 ’ expenses scandal which led to him being painfully ‘ outed ’ as gay			0
@entity1 ’s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment			1
@entity174 , the @entity133 who succeeded @entity158 as @entity1 ’s @entity12 deputy , claimed that an unnamed ‘ very senior @entity93 ’ told him : ‘ you take care of the workers , we ’ll take care of the bosses			1
’ was it @entity1 who said it , as many suspected ? ‘ no , ’ the chancellor snaps			1
but if he has rescued the economy and @entity187 and @entity188 are so useless , as he always claims , why are n’t the @entity93 ahead in the polls ? is it time to press the panic button ? ‘ the campaign is going as we wanted it to , ’ he insists			2
we always thought it would be close			0
’ mr @entity1 said he never ' personally felt low ' about being booed at the @entity44 in 2012 , but had to explain it to his children but @entity187 is proving more resilient than the @entity132 expected			1
‘ only because he ’s standing behind podiums in front of @entity124 supporters , ’ he mocks			1
@entity93 @entity169 claim that their party ’s campaign lacks passion and that @entity87 ’s @entity204 election guru , @entity203 , is too aggressive and too powerful			2
@entity1 stands foursquare behind them : ‘ @entity87 leads this election campaign from the front			1
’ it provokes him into showing some passion of his own			0
‘ i ’m not about to hand over the keys to no 11 to @entity188 , saying , “ go and wreck all the good work we ’ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country			0
” absolutely not ! ’ the one @entity216 has made during the last five years is moving his wife @entity106 ( pictured ) and their children to no 11 @entity110 , so he can be closer to them he says that if @entity124 wins , @entity16 will become an economic basket case like @entity126 did after socialist @entity127 won power			1
‘ @entity126 is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour , jobs go , debts pile up			0
people will say , “ my @entity228 , @entity16 is going backward instead of forward			1
” @entity1 is in his stride now , spitting venom			1
‘ all this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from @entity124 about standing up for the many not the few … the people who suffer most when @entity124 governments screw up the economy are the poorest			1
’ a measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month @entity87 named @entity1 as one of three potential successors – and no one laughed			1
so would he like to become @entity242 ? ‘ i ’m not a politician who spends my life thinking , “ what if … ? ” and “ what when … ? ” ’ rot , he can be every bit as calculating as @entity124 ’s machiavellian @entity250 , we tease him			2
‘ i ’m not rising to that ! ’ he laughs			0
@entity1 was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his @entity255 constituency , combining politics with a family day out			1
he was accompanied by @entity106 , a successful author and daughter of former @entity93 minister lord @entity260 , and @entity45 and @entity46			0
‘ we ’re all really looking forward to the election			0
the children are interested in it			0
my son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones , ’ he chuckles			0
‘ then @entity269 came on tv and we switched over to that			0
’ with that , @entity1 takes another sip of his @entity9 cider , aptly called @entity275			2
it slakes @entity1 ’s thirst for now			2
but he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the @entity132 do n’t win election gold on may 7 .			0

@entity1 sits down with the @entity281 while on the campaign trail
reveals how much has changed since he was booed at 2012 @entity44
warns @entity16 will become an economic basket case under @entity124
hits out at rival 's ' sanctimonious rubbish ' about standing up for the many
