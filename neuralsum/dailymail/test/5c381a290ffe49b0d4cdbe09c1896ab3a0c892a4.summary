@entity0 teamed up with a @entity2 start - up to make a light reflective spray for cyclists , called @entity5 @entity0 is known for making cars packed with safety features but it ’s a low - tech safety solution for cyclists that has proved a surprising success			1
the car manufacturer teamed up with a @entity2 - based start - up to make a temporary light reflective spray for cyclists , called @entity5			1
the paint has proved so popular that the trial cans up for grabs at certain cycling shops in @entity20 were snapped up in days			1
and some of these are now on sale on @entity23 for £ 45 ( $ 66 ) at the time of writing			1
@entity0 launched the paint to increase the visibility of cyclists on the road			2
it contains powder - fine reflective particles designed to react to a car ’s headlights , alerting drivers to the presence of cyclists in the dark			1
the paint is invisible in daylight , but in the dark it reflects light in the same direction as the light source to illuminate the objects it has been sprayed on			0
dispensed in a spray can , the paint can be washed off , so it can also be applied to clothes , helmets , pushchairs , dog leads and obviously , bikes			2
a trial began in @entity20 bike shops on 2 april to gauge public interest and 2,000 cans were given away free as word of the popular product spread			1
at the time , @entity0 said that if the paint proved a hit , the project ‘ will expand nationally and internationally ’			1
a spokesman told @entity58 that the company is ‘ extremely pleased with the response ’ and experts at @entity0 's headquarters in @entity62 are discussing whether the product could be sold , and is comparable with @entity0 's auto offering			2
it washes off but can last for days on bike frames ( pictured ) @entity5 is a reflective safety spray			1
it ’s invisible by daylight but reflects light in the dark			0
designed to react to a car ’s headlights , the spray reflects light in the same direction as the light source - shining brightly and alerting drivers to a cyclist ’s presence			2
it washes off completely and wo n’t mark surfaces , so it can be used on clothing , helmets , metal frames and even pets ’ collars			0
the paint lasts approximately one week after application , depending on surface it ’s sprayed upon and how much a user applies			0
however , there are no immediate plans to sell the paint			0
consequently , information about how much it may retail for has not been revealed , but there is still a chance cyclists might be able to buy @entity5 in the future in cycling shops or even at @entity0 garages			1
the lack of concrete plans has led cyclists eager to try the paint to attempt to get hold of some on @entity23 , where cans are on currently on sale for £ 45 ( $ 66 )			1
but in fact , savvy shoppers can try a similar spray for less than £ 18			0
@entity5 is made by a @entity2 start - up called @entity121			1
it currently sells four different types of spray : a light - reflective spray for metal , wood and plastic , an invisible reflective spray for textiles , a pale grey version of the same kind , and even a light - reflective spray for pets on its website			1
all of them are temporary and can be washed off			0
