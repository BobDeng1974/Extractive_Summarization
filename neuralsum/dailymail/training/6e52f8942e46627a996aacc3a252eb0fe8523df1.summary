by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:54 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 15:17 est , 29 november 2012 lord @entity2 wants @entity3 to ' verify ' a new independent regulator and act as a ' backstop ' for those newspapers which did not sign up one of @entity9 ’s most powerful quangos would have ultimate responsibility for press regulation under dramatic plans set out in @entity2 ’s report			1
the judge insisted his proposals would not amount to state regulation of newspapers , but legislation was needed to enforce it			0
but both @entity20 and @entity21 today criticised the plan to change the law to put state media watchdog @entity3 in overall charge of ‘ verifying ’ a new independent regulatory body			1
the report recommended the new body would be able to impose £ 1million fines on newspapers and demand front page apologies			0
the prime minister said he agreed with much of what @entity2 suggested , but refused to back legislation to enforce it			2
lord @entity2 said his proposed new body - to replace the existing @entity36 - would promote high standards of journalism and protect the rights of individuals			1
as part of the judge 's plans , the chairman and the board of the new body must include a majority of members who are independent from the industry			0
serving editors , mps and ministers would be banned from being on the board			0
a separate independent panel - which could include a serving editor - would make appointments to the board and its chairman			0
the panel in turn would be overseen by @entity3 , which would review the independence of the process every two years			2
but @entity3 is a government quango , and its chief executive is appointed by ministers , raising serious doubts about the process 's independence from government			1
while @entity20 and @entity21 disagree on much of the @entity2 report , both are opposed to the idea of @entity3 overseeing the system of regulation legislation passed in @entity75 would be needed for the new body to be recognised in legal processes and to allow @entity3 to oversee its independence and effectiveness			1
these are the main proposals for the press set out in the @entity2 report : @entity3 would also be a ‘ backstop ’ regulator for newspapers who did not sign up to the new scheme			1
under @entity2 's plans , an arbitration process would be put in place for newspapers to resolve complaints from members of the public			2
organisations that signed up would have legal costs limited if the dispute went to court , but this would require a change in the law			0
lord @entity2 also wants legislation to ‘ enshrine , for the first time , a legal duty on the government to protect the @entity104 ’ but the idea of state body @entity3 being involved in press regulation has proven one of the most contentious parts of the plan			1
mr @entity20 warned : ' @entity3 is already a very powerful regulatory body and we should be trying to reduce concentrations of power rather than increase them			1
' @entity3 was set up by @entity115 in 2003			2
six years later , @entity20 warned ' @entity3 , as we know it , will cease to exist ' if he became @entity117 as part of a crackdown on quangos			2
the chief executive of @entity3 is currently @entity122 , appointed in 2006 , who was previously a media advisor to mr @entity115			1
mr @entity122 , was tipped as director general of the @entity125 , can continue in the post for as long as he likes because the job does not have a fixed term			0
@entity2 insisted ‘ this is not , and can not be characterised as , statutory regulation of the press ’			0
‘ what is proposed here is independent regulation of the press organised by the press , with a statutory verification process to ensure that the required levels of independence and effectiveness are met by the system in order for publishers to take advantage of the benefits arising as a result of membership , ’ he added			0
government quango @entity3 was created by @entity115 , and its current chief executive @entity122 is a former @entity9 policy advisor			1
critics say because the @entity3 boss is appointed by ministers it can not oversee press regulation while mr @entity21 has backed much of the @entity2 plan , he also warned against involving @entity3			1
‘ @entity3 has a key role in regulating the content of broadcast media and i 'm yet to be convinced that it is best placed to take on this new , light touch function with the print media too , ’ the deputy prime minister said			2
@entity164 mp @entity163 , a member of the @entity165 , warned @entity3 would wield too much power			0
he said : ‘ we just ca n’t simply farm out these important decisions with a blank cheque to somebody who is wholly unelected and unaccountable			0
‘ having the government say to the press , “ these are the specific steps we need you to take , otherwise we will either legislate or regulate ” is a pretty rum form of self - regulation			0

lord @entity2 wants to give state watchdog *oversight* of new independent regulator
@entity3 was created by @entity115 and its chief executive is a former @entity9 policy advisor
@entity20 warns @entity3 is already too powerful
@entity21 who backs much of @entity2 said he is ' yet to be convinced ' that involving @entity3 is a good idea
