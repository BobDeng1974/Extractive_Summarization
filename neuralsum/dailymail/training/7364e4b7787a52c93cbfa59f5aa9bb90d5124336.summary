by @entity0 , political editor for all those @entity2 with an overseas holiday booked and paid for – but still waiting for their long - delayed passports to drop through the letter box , it was n’t the most tactful of remarks			2
tourism minister @entity7 suggested they consider holidaying at home			1
in fact , she said , there was a ‘ lot to be said for the “ staycation ”			1
’ to rub salt into the wound , the minister ’s pronouncement emerged as she watched @entity18 take on @entity19 – in her other role as sports minister – in @entity22 , @entity23			1
earlier this week , home secretary @entity40 apologised to people whose travel plans had been disrupted by delays at the @entity44 – there is a backlog of around 30,000 applications – and unveiled a series of emergency measures to speed matters up			1
miss @entity7 , asked about the situation in an interview with political magazine @entity53 , said : ‘ i ’m in no doubt , i ’m very confident that people will get their passports			1
‘ but if they do n’t want to go away , we have some fantastic places to visit and holiday			2
i think there ’s a lot to be said for the “ staycation ”			1
people need to do what they like			0
‘ we are going to have a great summer , we are certainly going to have a great summer of sport too , there ’s lots of opportunities to build your holiday around a spoilt - for - choice list of events – the @entity76 , we ’ve got the golf , we ’ve got the @entity78			2
it ’s a wonderful place to have your holiday			0
’ government sources said it was clear miss @entity7 , the mp for @entity83 and the @entity84 , had not been telling people where to holiday , but simply extolling the virtues of @entity2 as a destination			1
however , retired nurse @entity89 , 68 – who had to miss out on a £ 1,750 cruise after she was told the day before she was due to sail that her passport was not ready – said of miss @entity7 : ‘ how dare she tell us where to go on holiday ? cheeky sod			1
people will be gunning for her			0
’ mrs @entity89 , of @entity98 added : ‘ she is not living in the real world			0
ministers have no business telling me where i can take a break			0
’ @entity104 , 43 , from @entity105 , only got his passport the day before he flew out to @entity107 for a weekend away with his wife @entity108 last month , despite submitting his application four weeks earlier			0
miss @entity7 had said she was confident the passport application backlog would be cleared , despite holidaymakers queuing outside the @entity44 in @entity112 the @entity114 project manager said : ‘ @entity7 ’s comments are laughable			1
it is not her place to tell people where to holiday			0
if somebody has made their plans and put their passport application in in good time they should be able to travel where they like			0
’ @entity127 also condemned miss @entity7 ’s remarks			1
@entity129 , immigration spokesman , said : ‘ what does she know that we do n’t ? is this crisis going to last all summer ? holidays in @entity2 are fantastic but ministers should n’t be trying to divert attention from the chaos they created			0
‘ people need their passports for business , family funeral visits , residency permits and other personal reasons as well as holidays			0
@entity7 should be on to the @entity143 to get this sorted now , rather than telling families they wo n’t be going abroad any time soon			2
’ but @entity127 also risked embarrassment , after former minister @entity147 appeared to agree with miss @entity7			1
‘ it ’s already bad enough that holiday companies ramp up the cost of flights in school holidays , ’ he said			0
‘ perhaps the passport fiasco will encourage people to stay at home , to support the @entity2 tourism industry			2
’ passport officials say they have been hit by the highest level of applications for 12 years , with the usual summer increase starting far earlier than usual			2
@entity161 has said that anyone with imminent travel plans would be fast - tracked without charge			0
applicants renewing from overseas will have a 12 - month extension to their existing passport			0
a @entity169 spokesman said : ‘ @entity7 was crystal clear that she was confident that people would get their passports to be able to travel overseas			1
as tourism minister it is completely right that she champions the domestic tourism market but she was in no way linking the two issues			0
’ the backlog of passport applications at an office in @entity181			1
