the study from @entity1 claims the link between height and intelligence is 70 per cent genetic they are already cursed with the rather unflattering label of ‘ vertically challenged ’			1
now experts say short people may also be intellectually challenged too - or at least in comparison to their taller counterparts			2
a new study has found a link between iq and height , suggesting that those who are shorter are on average more likely to be less intelligent			1
academics identified genes that influence both height and @entity13 , and said there was a ‘ significant genetic correlation ’ between the two factors			1
the research , which covered more than 6,800 unrelated people , is the first to analyse dna markers in such a way			2
@entity27 , from @entity1 ’s @entity28 , said the link was small but important			1
he said : ‘ we tested whether @entity31 - based genetic similarities among people related to their similarities in height and intelligence			2
‘ previous studies have used twin or family data to examine similarities between height and intelligence , whereas ours was the first to examine this using actual dna markers in unrelated people			2
‘ what we found was a small association between height and intelligence such that people who are taller tend to be smarter			2
’ the claim is likely to be disputed by millions in @entity49 who fall short of the average height , 5ft 3in for women and 5ft 9in for men			1
one is certain to be @entity54 , speaker of the house of commons , who at 5ft 5ins is dwarfed by his 5ft 11in wife , @entity56			0
but among those who appear to prove the theory is @entity59 , who is 6ft 1in is blessed with both height and intelligence			0
others include actress @entity64 , who studied @entity66 and @entity67 literature at @entity68 and is fluent in both languages			0
@entity70 , the host of @entity71 , the puzzle - based television show , is 6ft 5in			0
@entity27 conducted his study in partnership with academics from @entity77 and @entity78			1
they based their findings on data compiled from thousands of people recruited for the @entity83 between 2006 and 2011			0
@entity13 was measured by tests which examined reaction times , powers of recall and linguistic ability			0
in a paper submitted to @entity92 journal , the team explained that about 70 per cent of the link can be explained by genetics and the rest by environmental influences			1
they added : ‘ we found a moderate and statistically significant genetic correlation between height and general intelligence			1
’ prove the theory ? @entity71 presenter @entity70 ( left ) is 6 ' 5 " , and prime minister @entity59 ( right ) is 6 ' 1 " it is hoped that revealing the genetic correlation between height and iq could help predict a person ’s health problems , the @entity102 reported			1
previous studies have linked short stature to heightened risk of cardiovascular disease			0
higher iq has been linked to longevity and a decreased risk of coronary heart disease , stroke and suicide			0
previous studies have also claimed that short - man syndrome , known as the @entity119 complex , does exist			0
researchers at @entity68 recently found that feeling smaller makes people paranoid , distrustful and scared of others			0
in fact , men of about 5ft 4in have been shown to be 50 per cent more likely to be jealous and distrustful of their partners than those measuring 6ft 6in			1
studies have also claimed smaller people are more likely than taller ones to have poor mental health .			0

@entity1 study claims ' significant correlation ' between factors
70 per cent of link caused by genetics , rest by environmental factors , it says
millions of @entity49 fall under 5 ' 3 " average for women and 5 ' 9 " for men
