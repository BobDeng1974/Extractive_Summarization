the ozone layer that shields the @entity3 from the sun is showing the first signs of recovery , @entity1 scientists have revealed			1
the gaping hole in the ozone layer above @entity9 – which in the 1980s caused a major environmental scare – has stopped growing , they have found			1
and other damage to the ozone layer is ‘ well on track ’ to recovery and may have even been reversed by 2050 , according the @entity13 and the @entity14			1
@entity3 's protective but fragile ozone layer is finally starting to rebound , says a @entity13 panel of scientists			1
scientists hail this as rare environmental good news , demonstrating that when the world comes together it can stop a brewing ecological crisis			2
here the shifting size of the ozone hole is illustrated in a dark blue @entity27 forms a ‘ screen ’ in the upper levels of the atmosphere which absorbs damaging solar rays			2
evidence emerged 30 years ago that ozone was being severely depleted by man - made gases , such as the @entity35 used in fridges			2
it caused a huge health scare , especially in southern - hemisphere countries such as @entity40 and @entity41 , which are situated close to the massive hole in the ozone layer above @entity9			1
@entity3 's ozone forms a protective ' screen ' in the upper atmosphere that absorbs damaging solar rays			2
it shields @entity3 from the sun , but 30 years ago it emerged that man - made gases were severely depleting it , opening up ' holes ' and increasing radiation risks on @entity3			0
this led to a ban on chlorofluorocarbons ( @entity35 ) , pollutants found in items such as fridges			0
and now actions such as these have enabled the ozone to start recovering , according to the latest report			2
experts predicted that the reduced screening from uv rays would lead to soaring rates of skin cancer			0
the scare led to a 1987 ban on @entity35 gases in fridges and aerosols – an action that the @entity1 said is responsible for the ozone recovery and has saved 2 million a year from skin cancer			1
@entity14 secretary - general @entity75 said : ‘ international action on the ozone layer is a major environmental success story			1
’ the hole in the ozone layer will start shrinking in about a decade , scientists hope			1
@entity14 senior scientific officer @entity82 added : ‘ now for the first time in this report we say that we see indications of a small increase in total ozone			0
that means recovery of the ozone layer in terms of total ozone has just started			2
the ozone layer that shields the @entity3 from the @entity95 is showing the first signs of recovery , @entity1 scientists have revealed			1
the gaping hole in the ozone - which in the 1980s caused a major environmental scare - has stopped growing , they have found ' we think in about 2025 or thereabouts we ’ll be able to say with certainty that the ozone hole is getting smaller			1
’ professor @entity104 from the @entity105 said that test results from his organisation would throw extra light on the @entity14 ’s findings			0
‘ we have to be a bit cautious , but this does look on the face of it like some very good news , ’ he said			0
‘ our own data from the @entity9 will take a few weeks to process but we hope to confirm the findings			0
if it ’s accurate , it underlines the potential power of international agreement			0
’ @entity120 , @entity13 ’s executive director , used the success of the international protocol to call for a similar international deal on climate change			0
@entity125 announced this week he will travel to @entity126 on september 23 for an international summit on climate change			0
@entity129 has also agreed to attend – but the ability of the conference to see meaningful agreements has been undermined by news that the leaders of @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 will not be there .			0
