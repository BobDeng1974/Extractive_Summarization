@entity0 has told @entity1 to reassure ' a world torn by identity conflicts ' by voting @entity4 in an 11th - hour intervention in the independence debate			1
the former @entity8 president said he was reluctant to express his view before now because he appreciated the decision was ' @entity1 alone to make '			1
but he said uncertainty over currency and the impact of ' long , complex ' negotiations had convinced him to urge the people of @entity1 to keep the @entity16			1
' i hope my decision to do so will be received in the spirit of friendship with which it is offered			2
' i have watched the debate on the future of @entity1 with great interest and admiration			0
' with so much turmoil and division across the globe , i hope the @entity1 will inspire the world with a high turnout and a powerful message of both identity and inclusion			1
' i understand and sympathise with those who want independence			0
@entity1 is blessed with impressive human and natural resources and a strong desire for more widely shared prosperity and social solidarity			0
a spot of sightseeing : mr @entity0 playing golf on the famous course at @entity59 in 2001 ' however , i hope the @entity1 people will vote to remain in the @entity61 for several reasons : the proposal to keep the pound as its currency without the support that @entity61 membership provides carries substantial risks , as we saw in the @entity70 after the financial crisis			1
' @entity72 will require a long complex negotiating process with considerable uncertainty and potential to weaken the @entity1 economy			2
' the increased autonomy promised @entity1 by the @entity61 provides most of the benefits of independence and avoids the downside risks			2
' unity with maximum self - determination sends a powerful message to a world torn by identity conflicts that it is possible to respect our differences while living and working together			1
' this is the great challenge of our time			0
the @entity1 can show us how to meet it			0
' mr @entity0 's statement came amid increasing hostility towards ' celebrity ' or foreign backers to the no campaign - including @entity98 @entity97 , who urged voters not to break up the @entity16 despite not being part of it .			0
