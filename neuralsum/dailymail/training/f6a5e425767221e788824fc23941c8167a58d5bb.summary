‘ that seemed feasible , because all of the purchases i made without @entity96 were only charged one time			0
’ but @entity8 ’s customer service department passed him back to @entity23 , because the company does n’t keep records of names linked to transactions			1
upon launch , @entity8 ’s focus on security and privacy was a big selling point , but mr @entity85 said the situation of being passed between the two corporations was ‘ every consumer ’s worst nightmare ’			2

card numbers are not stored on the device , instead , a unique @entity160 is created , encrypted and stored in the @entity163 of the device			0

the @entity181 chip is fitted across the top of the phone			0
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			0
it uses the @entity188 app and cards that are already on file with @entity191 can be saved to it			0
users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account			0
this is verified by the card 's bank before being accepted			0
if an @entity4 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity4 service			2
