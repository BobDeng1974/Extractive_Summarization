by @entity0 published : 01:39 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 8 august 2013 lord @entity1 said families ' make do and mend ' by repairing broken appliances to reduce waste sent to landfill families should recapture the spirit of ‘ make do and mend ’ by repairing broken washing machines , toasters and televisions rather than buying new ones , a @entity10 minister claimed last night			1
lord @entity1 , an environment minister , said even when shopping for new appliances , gadgets and even clothes , people should consider buying second hand goods online on auction websites such as @entity21 - to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill			1
the proposal to make it easier for people to fix or replace households items with good quality used ones is part of a ‘ waste prevention programme ’ published by the environment department to comply with an @entity34 directive			1
ministers say changing our throwaway culture will not only cut down on the tonnes of household waste thrown away every year and help the environment , but will also save families money			1
‘ reducing waste is everyone ’s responsibility ’ , @entity43 told the @entity44 , ‘ what we have set out in this programme will help businesses save money , help people cut back on waste and pass on items that they would otherwise throw away ’			1
the @entity54 will first measure the nation ’s progress by calculating how many tonnes of waste are produced by households , businesses and industry and setting reduction targets			0
businesses and families will be told to take care not to waste food , paper , plastics , and electronic and electrical equipment , according to proposals published in a consultation which will be considered until the end of next month			2
but @entity10 mp @entity73 , said : ‘ since when do we need government to tell us what to do with broken toasters ? i do n’t really want to live in a world where @entity54 officials can decide what i do with electrical appliances that i could repair			0
’ despite this drive to reduce waste , @entity54 have resisted calls for a charge on single use carrier bags in @entity86 , although such a charge has been successful in @entity88 and @entity89 and will begin shortly in @entity90			0
@entity92 plastic carrier bags , backed by a @entity94 campaign , has widespread political support			0
families should recapture the spirit of ' make do and mend ' by repairing broken washing machines , toasters and televisions rather than buying new ones the consultation document states that consumers should ‘ consider their own buying habits to identify where they could make savings ’ , for example , through wasting less food			2
it states : ‘ there are several simple practices which all contribute to reducing the amount of waste produced ; from reusing shopping bags , repairing items instead of automatically replacing them , passing on items no longer needed or selling them , e.g. through online auction sites ’			1
making and selling electronic and electrical equipment will face demands from government agencies to make products which last for longer and are easier to repair			1
officials say helping people to recycle as much as possible would save @entity126 businesses £ 17 billion a year , while re-using household appliances and furniture could save families £ 1 billion a year as well as create work for repair shops			2
as electrical goods have become cheaper , there are fewer electrical repair shops , and the consultation says shopkeepers have a ‘ key role ’ in convincing people they can have a lifetime of use out of a product			2
under @entity143 laws , @entity126 must produce a waste strategy by the end of the year			0
the @entity34 directive on waste recommends measures including forcing consumers to pay for items of packaging which would otherwise be free to reduce the amount of excess paper and plastic used			0
earlier this year , another @entity54 minister , @entity155 warned that families were needlessly wasting ‘ enormous amounts of food ’ worth up to £ 50 of food a month , much of which was ‘ perfectly safe ’ to eat			0
according to government figures , about 228 million tonnes of waste is thrown away every year in @entity86 .			0
