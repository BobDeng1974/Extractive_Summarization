@entity0 is about to lose his title as the owner of the world 's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted for the first time			1
the £ 400million mega-yacht , known only as @entity8 , will measure a staggering 590ft ( 180m ) - longer than some cruise ships - when it is completed			1
this will make the super-secretive yacht around 54ft ( 17.5m ) longer than the @entity13 , which is @entity15 - owning oligarch @entity0 's current flagship vessel			1
stunned photographers captured the vessel as it was transported out of the 170 - metre dry dock at @entity19 shipbuilder @entity40 's yard because it had become too large			2
the yacht , which was minus its bow section , was quickly moved to the larger 220 - metre dock so engineers could continue the awesome project			2
@entity44 , from @entity45 , said : ' the photographers who took the pictures of @entity47 were overwhelmed by the size of it			0
super-secretive : the £ 400million megayacht , known only as @entity8 , is rumoured to have been commissioned by the @entity52 @entity35 rumours : there has been suggestions that the boat , which will be longer than some cruise ships , has been commissioned by the @entity35 prediction : experts say that if it has been commissioned for the @entity35 it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often @entity64 ( 536ft ) 180m ( 590ft ) £ 272million £ 400million @entity8 's fuel tank will be able to hold 1million litres - with the vessel staffed by up to 50 of the best staff for 365 days of the year			1
the @entity13 has two swimming pools , two helipads , a gym , hair salon , dancefloor and a 007 - style submarine			2
both yachts are confined to just a handful of areas in the world that can accomdate a boat of such size , including @entity80 and @entity81			0
' it is difficult to say at this stage but i think it will be a very elegant yacht and more interesting looking then @entity13			0
' there appears to be a special propulsion system which should make it one of the fastest yachts out there			0
' in terms of length , we think it will be around 180 - metres which makes it longer than some cruise ships			1
' if it has been commissioned for the @entity35 it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often			0
it is more of a question of prestige , to have the world 's largest yacht			0
' official details on megayachts such as @entity8 and @entity0 's @entity13 are notoriously sketchy due to confidentiality agreements set up between the builders and their customers			1
but they are known to have incredible security systems and it is not uncommon for them to be flanked by smaller yachts and submarines which help make up a billionaire 's flotilla			0
it is thought a yacht this size will cost its new owner around £ 400million - and that is just the initial payment with the yacht having astronomical running costs			2
the yacht 's fuel tank will be able to hold a staggering one million litres while the owner will have to pay 50 of the best staff in the world to man it 365 days of the year			1
secret : official details on @entity8 are notoriously sketchy due to confidentiality agreements set up between the builders and their customers dwarfing : @entity47 made surrounding boats look tiny as it was taken from one dock to another thirsty : the yacht 's fuel tank will be able to hold a staggering one million litres while the owner will have to pay 50 of the best staff in the world to man it 365 days of the year home : when the yacht is completed next year it is most likely to be moored on the @entity148 massive : there will be just two locations which can accommodate a boat of such size - @entity80 and @entity81 @entity40 , which is building @entity47 , has refused to discuss the top secret yacht although rumours in the industry are that is being build for @entity52 billionaire @entity159			1
@entity159 , 57 , is worth around £ 10 billion and a member of the @entity35			0
if he is the owner , he is thought to have ordered the new toy as a replacement for his @entity164 yacht which he has owned for the past 20 - years			2
when the yacht is completed next year it is most likely to be moored on the @entity148 but there will be just two locations which can accommodate a boat of such size - @entity80 and @entity81 .			0

identity of ' @entity8 ' owner has not yet been *revealed* , but some say it 's been commissioned by @entity52 *royals*
will be a staggering 590ft long - longer than some cruise ships
