starting in 2016 , women will be regularly assigned to combat roles , but may not be assigned to elite units such as the @entity10 and @entity11 over fears by former commandos they may distract the male members of the team			2
explaining that these fears are largely unfounded and being used as an excuse to keep them out of highly sought after assignments , female soldiers point to women on special operations teams in @entity23 and ‘ @entity24 ’ as proof they are fit			1

they ’re not in @entity23 to get married			0
’ @entity69 said the last time military leaders tried to use this argument , with ‘ @entity24 , ’ it was eventually proven false			1
in the time since the policy that kept gays from openly serving in the military has since been repealed , there has been no proof any distraction exists , @entity69 added			2
