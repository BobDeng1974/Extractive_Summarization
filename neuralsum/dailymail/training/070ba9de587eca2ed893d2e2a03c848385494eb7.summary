by @entity1 reporter published : 19:02 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 02:56 est , 9 august 2013 not for sale : the co-op will stop selling @entity4 after its publishers refused an ultimatum to use ' modesty bags ' co-op stores will no longer sell ‘ lads mag ’ nuts after the title rejected an ultimatum to use ' modesty bags ' or be removed from shelves			1
nuts publisher @entity14 has announced that it will not use the bags , describing the ultimatum as ' an unreasonable attempt to prevent shoppers from freely browsing a legal magazine that is already displayed according to @entity21 guidelines '			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity23 said : ' our position has not changed			0
if @entity4 and @entity26 , or any of the other publications , loaded and @entity28 , do not put their titles into modesty bags by the date we ’ve given of september 9 , we will no longer sell the magazines			1
' @entity14 managing director @entity33 said : ' the co-operative ’s knee - jerk attempt to restrict access to a product that consumers have enjoyed for nearly a decade is wrong			1
' nuts takes its obligation to craft products that are right for consumers and retailers alike very seriously and for a number of weeks now we have had new covers in place , which have a more conservative tone			1
' we are delighted with our readers ’ response to the new covers and last week ’s issue was our biggest - selling since february			0
' the objection that niche lobby groups have against certain sectors of the media should not mean that the right to purchase a perfectly legal product is restricted for the over half a million nuts readers			1
' as has been widely reported in the media in recent weeks , this is no longer a question of whether or not you like men ’s magazines , it is a question of how far you can restrict the public ’s ability to consume free and legal media before it becomes censorship			0
' the co-operative , which describes itself as one of the @entity74 ’s largest magazine sellers , introduced opaque screens on shelves last month to shield children from ' lewd pictures ' on front covers			2
it comes amid increasing debate about the effects of sexual images on children , with @entity83 recently setting out a raft of reforms which will introduce family - friendly filters that automatically block internet porn unless customers choose to opt out			0
following the @entity23 ’s announcement , @entity89 said it would sell lads ’ magazines only to over- 18s			2

@entity105 , the co-operative ’s head of product development , admitted that the store would lose money over the move			1
speaking on @entity112 ’s @entity111 , she said : ' we will be losing money but we are responding to our customers ’ concerns			2
' these are the publications that our customers are telling us they ’re concerned about			0
' we do everything we can to ensure they are out of sight of children shopping in our shops			0
' but sometimes during the trading day displays get disrupted			0
' we think a modesty cover would be a fail - safe solution			0
