by @entity1 reporter did @entity4 clipper @entity2 take out his anger at being ejected from his team 's first playoff game on an unlucky fan ? @entity2 was clearly upset when he fouled out against the @entity9			1
and when he saw a replay of his last foul he threw his hands up in frustration			1
but at the time he just happened to be holding a cup of water in one hand that he emptied out onto the @entity9 fan standing behind him			2
most likely it was an innocent accident			0
but @entity25 notes that both the victim and his friend are dressed in @entity29 shirts and had cheered at @entity2 's ejection			2
would cheering a foul be enough to get @entity2 to throw water on a fan ? the fan in question , 22 - year - old @entity36 , does n't think so			1
' honestly , i think it fell out of his hand , ' he said in an interview with @entity41			0
fan @entity36 is soaked as his friend has a good laugh @entity2 walks off without even noticing what he 's done ' he fouled out and he was frustrated , so it just fell out of his hand , ' he said			1
' it just slipped out			0
' for what it 's worth , @entity36 's unnamed friend sitting next to him at the time believes it was a purposeful dousing			0
for now , only @entity2 knows for sure .			0
