@entity0 , 53 , has one leg which weighs two stone more than the other after cancer treatment a grandmother has spoken of the agony of living with a medical condition that means she has one leg two stone heavier than another			1
@entity0 's left leg began to swell after treatment for cervical cancer 17 years ago , but it is now so huge that her calf has a circumference of almost 3ft			1
the 53 - year - old suffers from lymphoedema , a condition where the body 's plumbing goes haywire			1
this means fluid does n't drain properly , leaving her with a painfully swollen leg			2
mrs @entity0 is now unable to bend her leg , is barely able to walk , and doctors have said she will be completely immobile in less than a decade			1
despite this , she has been denied @entity29 funding for a liposuction operation to drain the fluid from her leg			1
she made the bid through her doctor , who agreed she would benefit from the treatment , which would cost the @entity29 £ 11,000			1
but after her case was assessed by a panel at her local @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , her application was denied as the @entity38 said the evidence for the procedure 's effectiveness was ' poor '			1
she claims she has been given several reasons as to why she ca n't have the treatment , including it being a ' cosmetic procedure '			0
mrs @entity0 , of @entity45 , @entity46 , has been forced to give up her job working with special needs children while she continues to battle the @entity29 for the treatment			1
last month , she was rejected by the @entity50 on the grounds that her case is not ' exceptional enough ' , she said			0
mrs @entity0 said : ' my leg is huge and the surgeon told me the only option is to have the operation			1
' i 've had loads of different excuses for being rejected - they once even said it would be " cosmetic "			0
' i was also told that i was n't " exceptional enough " to get the op. it 's ridiculous			0
she added : ' i was told that my best bet of getting the operation is to move to an area where the @entity29 provides it - it 's a postcode lottery			1
' but i 've got two small grandchildren down the road i do n't want to up sticks			0
' mrs @entity0 's condition developed because she had lymph nodes removed along with her cervix as part of a hysterectomy			1
her lymphatic system is no longer strong enough to drain her leg of the fluid causing the build - up			1
the lymphatic system is a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood normally , fluid drains from the lymph channels into the lymph nodes			0
these nodes act like filter stations that process the waste - the fluid itself goes back through the body into the circulation			2
however , if the lymphatic system is faulty - such as after cancer treatment - the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up			1
the skin becomes like a soggy mattress , because there 's too much fluid in the tissue			2
mrs @entity106 calculated that her left leg was two stone heavier than her right leg using computer modelling			1
she said : ' the doctor knows how much the lymph fluid weighs so she measures my legs at 2cm intervals , works out the difference in size and puts it all into the computer and it calculates the difference in weight			2
' she must now wear a compression garment , which puts pressure on tissues to stop fluid build - up and encourage fluid to drain			2
the liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again			1
mrs @entity0 's left leg has swollen so much her calf now has a circumference of almost three feet			1
she is unable to bend it , leaving her barely able to walk			2
doctors have said she will be immobile within a decade she suffers from lymphoedema , a condition in which the body 's lymphatic system does n't drain fluid properly from the leg , causing fluid to accumulate in the tissue and the leg to swell up it would cost the @entity29 £ 11 , 000 , with a continuing cost of around £ 300 a year to remeasure her leg and create a new compression garment if there is a change in size			1
the liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again			1
without the operation , mrs @entity0 must continue her daily struggle			2
she said : ' i get up in the morning and have a massage and put on compression garment - all that takes an hour			0
' then it 's very difficult to walk			0
it weighs nearly three stone more than it should because it 's filled with lymph fluid			2
lymphoedema is a condition where the lymphatic system — a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood — is n’t working properly			2
normally , fluid drains from the lymph channels into the lymph nodes			0
these nodes act like filter stations that process the waste — the fluid itself goes back through the body into the circulation			0
however , if the lymphatic system is faulty , the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up			2
the skin becomes like a soggy mattress , because there ’s too much fluid in the tissue			2
limbs can swell to double their normal size and can be extremely painful			0
the condition is common in middle - aged women			0
' i ca n't walk any distance and when i do i use a stick			0
doctors said that by the time i 'm 60 i will be immobile			0
already i ca n't move that knee at all			0
' i do n't want to go down that road , that 's not what i want out of life , the only option for me is to fight			0
' her battle started in 2013 when massages began failing her and was told she needed the liposuction			0
her husband of 26 years @entity213 , a 48 - year - old removal man , must assist her in her daily chores			1
a spokesperson at @entity216 , said : ' we are very sorry to hear mrs @entity0 's concerns , and we do understand the difficult situation that patients are in when they come to us for individual funding			1
' there are treatments and drugs that we do not routinely fund , but which we know , and understand , that patients and their families want to look into and explore as a possible solution to their medical needs			0
' to enable this , people are able to apply for individual funding through their clinicians			0
' decisions are not taken lightly , and cases are thoroughly considered by a panel of hospital consultants , gps and lay people			0
' the panel sought an independent review from specialist at @entity244 and @entity245 , and their report was considered alongside the submission from mrs @entity0 's doctor			0
the @entity38 spokesperson continued : ' the @entity38 's panel fully considered mrs @entity0 's case , but found that the evidence of clinical effectiveness of the proposed treatment was poor			1
' we understand this is disappointing for @entity257 but without evidence that the treatment would be clinically effective , the panel could not approve the treatment			0
' now , mrs @entity0 is trying to raise £ 2,500 to get a machine to massage her leg but has so far raised just £ 220			1
