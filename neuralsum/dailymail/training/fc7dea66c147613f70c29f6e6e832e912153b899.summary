walk past @entity0 and @entity2 ’s home near @entity3 in @entity4 , and you might think you had stepped back 450 years			1
it is in the classic , half - timbered , @entity8 style - built on an oak frame , with an ancient tiled roof , and the first floor teetering over the ground floor			1
in fact , the cottage is only 14 years old			0
what ’s more , the @entity15 built the whole thing from scratch , teaching themselves plumbing , electrical wiring and medieval carpentry into the bargain			2
oh , and they also carved a majestic garden out of a dreary third - of - an - acre plot , which had only three plum trees and a lawn when they bought it			1
and all for only £ 200,000			0
grand design : @entity0 and @entity2 's @entity30 home			1
built for £ 110,000 , plus £ 90,000 to buy the land , it is now worth £ 600,000 - and the couple are planning a new wing majestic : @entity36 ( pictured ) and his wife @entity37 built the @entity8 - style home in @entity3 , @entity4 from scratch and lived in a static caravan during the construction to the manor born : @entity0 and @entity2 are pictured in their living room , whose low ceilings were dictated by the height of the oaks used for the building four - poster splendour : the @entity8 - style house , which took two - and - a - half years to complete , is packed with period furniture thanks to their efforts , it ’s worth more than £ 600,000			1
but they ’re not selling			0
‘ we ’d both come out of divorces and had no money , ’ says @entity0 , 69 , about their 1998 decision			1
@entity0 was a sales director while @entity37 , 48 , worked at a children ’s nursery as they built the house			1
‘ we were looking for something to renovate			0
but , because everything was grade ii - listed , we could n’t make the changes we wanted			0
so we decided to build it instead			0
‘ i always liked drinking in old @entity68 pubs , with inglenook fireplaces , ’ @entity0 says , ‘ and oak is so tactile			1
’ in fact , @entity0 has since built another two - and sold them on - just down the road			1
but , to begin with , he and @entity37 were pretty much in the dark			0
after the @entity15 bought the land for £ 90,000 , they spent the next two - and - a - half years in a static caravan on the site , as their dream took shape			1
building costs came to a total of £ 110,000			1
they bought the oak frame from a company in @entity86			1
‘ at first , ’ says @entity0 , ‘ the bank refused to give us money			2
they saw this pile of sticks in the yard , and thought we could never build a house out of them			0
‘ the man from the bank came back three weeks later , after the frame had been assembled , and was gobsmacked			0
’ three builders put together the 20 - ton frame on site but , after that , the @entity15 were left with little more than a skeleton , open to the skies			1
first , they had to put a roof on			0
‘ i belong to a running club and , one day , i ran past a big house near @entity108 , where they were re-tiling the roof , ’ says @entity0 , ‘ the tiles he was taking down were better than the ones he was putting up ! so i did a deal and bought 15,000 tiles			2
i borrowed a trailer from work to deliver them home			0
’ @entity119 : builders put together the 20 - ton frame on site but , after that , the @entity15 were left with little more than a skeleton , open to the skies			1
@entity36 is pictured on the roof during construction in 1998 swish : the @entity128 taught themselves how to plumb with great success			2
they also taught themselves electrical wiring and medieval carpentry after the @entity15 bought the land for £ 90,000 , they spent the next two - and - a - half years in a static caravan on the site , as their dream took shape hands - on experience : a sledgehammer - wielding @entity2 works on the roof during the construction phase in 1999 @entity0 taught himself how to tile a roof and to fill the panels between the timber framing			1
in elizabethan times , those panels were built out of wattle and daub ; nowadays , builders use a special insulation membrane that expands to fill any gaps as the oak dries			2
the joinery techniques @entity0 used are largely the same as they were in the 16th century			2
the box - like shape of the rooms is also typical of @entity8 houses			1
the dimensions are still dictated by the height of the oak trees , as they were 450 years ago			2
and , just like @entity8 houses , their cottage moved as the oak dried and shrank			1
‘ there were little gaps in the wall where the oak shrank , ’ explains @entity0			1
‘ you could see daylight through them — it was like seeing the sun through the stones at @entity175 ! but now we ’ve filled the gaps and the house has stopped drying and shrinking			0
’ having spent £ 200,000 on building the property , it is now worth in excess of £ 600,000			1
mr @entity36 has since built another two - and sold them on - just down the road @entity36 is pictured left in 1999 during the construction of the wooden frame			2
the joinery techniques @entity0 and @entity37 ( pictured right ) used are largely the same as they were in the 16th century @entity0 taught himself how to tile a roof and to fill the panels between the timber framing			2
in elizabethan times , those panels were built out of wattle and daub - nowadays , builders use a special insulation membrane that expands to fill any gaps as the oak dries the box - like shape of the rooms is typical of @entity8 houses			1
the dimensions are still dictated by the height of the oak trees , as they were 450 years ago the @entity128 have more dreams that they want to turn into reality			2
the next scheme is a new greenhouse - oak - framed , of course the @entity15 have n’t finished yet , though			2
lying in their front drive are 80 oak posts , which they are going to turn into a new wing			0
they ’ve already bought an 18th - century monk ’s bench to go inside			0
the extension will be based on the porch at @entity215 - the 15th - century house in @entity216 remodelled by sir @entity217 , in 1912			0
it was later lived in by the late gardening writer @entity219			0
the @entity15 are impressive gardeners , too			0
that bare third of an acre has now been turned into a paradise of winding paths , classical urns , and borders crammed with dogwood trees and more than 100 @entity228 maples			0
in one corner , there ’s a stately pond , dug out with the same @entity232 that laid the foundations of the house			0
and the @entity128 still want to turn their dreams into reality			0
the next scheme is a new greenhouse — oak - framed , of course .			0

@entity0 and @entity2 built their @entity8 - style home in @entity3 , @entity4 entirely from scratch
