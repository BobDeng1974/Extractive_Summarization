startling hidden camera footage shows migrants crossing illegally into the @entity2 from @entity3 , via a couple 's private property			1
@entity6 and @entity7 run a 50,000 - acre cattle ranch southwest of @entity9 , @entity10 and for years they 've complained about illegal immigrants - and suspected drug cartel members - jumping the four - strand wire fence that marks their 5 1/2 - mile border with @entity3			1
the couple even testified before @entity17 about the issue plaguing other @entity2 like them , who are abandoned by border patrol officers who maintain only a limited presence on rugged areas of the border			0
above , more migrants walking on their property with large packs usually used to transport drugs to prove just how at risk they are , the couple enlisted the help of border - security advocacy group @entity40 to set up several hidden cameras on their property			1
the group installed the cameras in well traveled paths about 10 - 15 miles north of the international border in march and april			2
in june , they came back to the property and the @entity49 's worst nightmares were confirmed : migrants , many carrying large packs used for drug smuggling , hiking over their ranch			1
' it just confirmed what we already knew , ' @entity54 told @entity58			0
' we have ceded to the cartels 20 miles , 30 miles inside the @entity2			0
' on their own : some @entity2 land - owners like the @entity63 are left defenseless on the border , since the land it too rugged to patrol ranchers like the @entity63 are particularly at risk because they live in a no - man 's land along the border			1
while @entity71 and @entity72 has more officers than ever maintaining the border , they leave rugged areas of land like the @entity77 relatively unchecked and instead patrol further north where it 's easier to catch illegal immigrants			0
@entity7 says she used to roam about her ranch freely , but now never goes without an escort for fear of becoming another victim of the aggressive cartels			2
another group caught on the hidden cameras is dressed in all camouflage while carrying much lighter packs without a trace : one in the group stays behind to sweep up their tracks the 2010 unsolved murder of @entity10 rancher @entity95 is believed to have been carried out by a smuggler who shot the man to death on his own land			1
' the fear we have is running across a group coming across with an @entity105 dressed in camouflage garb and carpet shows and small backpacks on their backs carrying meth , crack or heroin , ' her husband @entity6 said			2
many smugglers wear carpet shoes while crossing the borders to cover up their tracks			0
in one of the hidden camera videos , a group is seen in all camo walking on the ranch while a man in the back sweeps up their steps			0
the @entity63 say they find evidence of illigal immigrants on their land all the time , such as break - ins at their home and trash and clothing left behind .			0
