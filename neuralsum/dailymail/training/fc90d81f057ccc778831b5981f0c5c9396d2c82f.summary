a new survey shows just how little diversity there is in the fashion world , especially when it comes to magazine covers			0
the @entity6 assessed 44 major print publications across the globe to determine which magazines did and did not feature models from a minority background on their cover at some point in 2014			1
it found a shocking lack of diversity across the board , with white models appearing 567 times out of 611 total covers and people of colour appearing just 119 times			0
of the magazines surveyed , a number of them failed to use a woman of minority on the cover at all , including @entity53 @entity52 and @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , love and @entity63			1
and according to the survey , @entity55 is the biggest disappointment when it comes to representing minorities			0
in fact , the magazine has not featured a model of color on the cover in a whopping 12 years , the last instance being @entity75 's appearance in 2002			1
that being said , @entity55 has featured several non-white celebrities of color over the years , including @entity79 in may 2013 and @entity80 in november 2011			1
lack of representation : neither love ( left , fall / winter 2014 issue ) nor @entity54 ( right , september 2014 issue ) has chosen a single cover model of color this year pattern : @entity87 ( left , may 2014 issue ) and @entity89 ( right , july 2014 issue ) also overwhelmingly chose white models for the cover , with @entity89 only featuring one model of @entity95 descent all year but when it comes to cover girls who are professional models , they all have been white			1
even @entity100 - who was named @entity101 at the @entity102 in 2008 and was the first black @entity104 model to make @entity106 ' top - earning models list in 2014 - has never landed a solo @entity55 cover			1
@entity100 did appear on the cover with @entity110 and @entity111 on the november 2008 issue , but she is yet to star on the cover without any other models			0
meanwhile , her close pal @entity115 has been on the cover of @entity55 twice this year alone , as has 40 - year - old supermodel @entity117			2
by the numbers : this graph shows that black models were the minority that was best represented on magazine covers , followed by those from an @entity125 background @entity89 and @entity126 also overwhelmingly chose white models to appear on their covers in 2014 , with @entity89 only featuring one model of @entity95 descent all year			0
they did , however , choose @entity133 beauty @entity131 for their december 2014 cover			0
the glossy magazines who best represented minorities on the cover this year were @entity139 and @entity140 , the first of which used exclusively models of color in 2014			2
most of @entity140 's 2014 cover models were also women of color , although for the may cover they picked @entity150 supermodel @entity149 .			2

@entity53 @entity52 and @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , love and @entity63 all failed to use a woman of color on the cover at all in 2014
@entity55 has not featured a single model of color on a solo cover in 12 years
the @entity6 *classified* ' women of color ' as those who appear to be non-white or of mixed backgrounds
