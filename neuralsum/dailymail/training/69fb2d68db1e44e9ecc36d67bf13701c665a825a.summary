' sometimes you see the lights and a police officer and you 're scared , but he came up and talked to them and was really nice			0
he could have made it a bad day			0
' alongside her cheque , her note read : ' @entity49 , recently i was on vacation with my grandchildren and was pulled over for speeding			1
' officer @entity14 made it a good experience for my grandchildren by talking with them calmly and giving them stickers			1
he did n't leave me out and i got my very own sticker shock : ) thanks for a great attitude			1
' at ease : @entity14 said he always tries to make children feel at ease saying it can be a little scary for them when ' the guy in the big hat walks up to the car ' officer @entity68 told the channel : ' you usually just talk to the kids - the kids are just inquisitive when the guy in the big hat walks up to the car by the side of the highway and can be a bit nervous			2
