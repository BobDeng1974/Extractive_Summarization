by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 over a few beers one night @entity2 managed to squeeze out of @entity4 a few of his secrets about what makes a great commentary			1
‘ when it ’s a big race , ’ he replied , ‘ do n’t say something that people might just remember , say something that they will never forget			2
’ not an easy trick , of course , but through his distinguished career @entity4 managed to pull it off ridiculously often , either with vocabulary or purely by intonation			1
he was there : @entity4 with @entity21 's @entity20 after the 1964 @entity23 final win over @entity24 memorable : @entity4 's commentary of @entity26 ' save against @entity27 at the 1970 @entity28 is iconic it was this ability that helped draw many of the great and the good from his world to the @entity33 ’s @entity32 on wednesday for a celebration of the life and work of a man described several times as ‘ the nation ’s greatest ever sports broadcaster ’			1
sports fans of a certain age will recall that the voice of @entity4 , who died at 87 late last year , brought a stamp of authenticity to so many great events			1
and even if it was not a significant occasion , he could transport you to a world where it was			0
as @entity51 , who also took to the @entity53 stage to pay tribute , said : ‘ he made sport sound so special , including the mundane			1
’ @entity4 was a colossus behind the microphone in an era when sports coverage was less atomised than it is now , with the relative lack of players in the market making huge stars out of their figurehead broadcasters			1
that less can be more was a recurring theme , as one of his articles of faith was never to talk too much			0
‘ when you see a picture , caption it , ’ he told @entity2			0
‘ and do n’t forget that silence can be the most powerful thing			0
’ @entity75 moment : @entity78 captain @entity77 hangs onto the @entity23 as he is interviewed by @entity4 in the 1963 final win over @entity80 ups and downs : @entity4 speaks with @entity84 ' winning captain @entity83 , as a dejected @entity86 captain @entity85 listens in after their 3 - 0 fa cup final loss in 1960 bursts of footage reminded us that nobody could impart such meaning to a few simple words of the language , such as ‘ one - nil ’			1
his exclamation that accompanied @entity26 denying @entity27 in the 1970 @entity28 — ‘ what a save ! ’ — is a moment of spine - tingling drama comparable with @entity102 ’s ‘ what a score ! ’ to describe @entity104 ’s great @entity103 try three years later			0
@entity4 ’s first television shift in @entity106 was the night @entity107 broke four minutes for the mile in 1954 and his last major event was his 11th @entity110 at @entity111 in 2000			1
proud of his local newspaper roots , he brought a hard , journalistic edge to his work			0
he was unlike many of the pristine , photogenic young sports presenters of today , who you might prefer to marry your daughter than tell you the score			2
while @entity4 could be almost childishly hostile to some rivals from other organisations , they respected his talent , and he inspired fondness , admiration and loyalty among @entity33 colleagues such as @entity128			1
‘ every time he picked up the microphone he came alive , he elevated his performance , ’ said @entity128			0
‘ he encouraged us to aim for the standards he set			0
there was @entity4 and then there was the rest of us			1
instantly recognisable : @entity4 covered 11 summer olympics for the @entity33 , including the 1980 @entity138 the voice of sport : @entity4 was recruited by the @entity33 in 1955 and presented @entity141 ‘ somebody once told me , ‘ ‘ his bark is worse than his bite ’ ’			1
do n’t you believe it ! the new generation of broadcasters could learn a lot by looking back at @entity4 gems			1
’ athletics was particularly well represented on wednesday , with @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 among those in attendance			0
@entity159 said that words of praise from @entity4 could mean more than those from a coach , and @entity2 recalled the inspiration of his commentary from the @entity166 of 1960 : ‘ i wanted to do something that @entity4 would speak about			2
’ the man who brilliantly anchored coverage of the @entity170 was versatile too			0
he could ‘ do light ’ , repeatedly illustrated in a long and successful run as presenter of @entity174 for nearly 20 years			0
the edition in 1987 that featured @entity176 , seen as a massive coup , drew a gargantuan 18 million viewers			0
@entity4 also pulled off another trick that can not have been easy — enjoying an extremely happy family life with his wife @entity181 , despite the pressures of a hugely demanding career and considerable fame			2
the touching tributes from two of his six children , all of whom were present along with grandchildren , bore testament to that			0
quite remarkable : @entity4 presented @entity174 for 18 years			2
here he is pictured with @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity176 and @entity154 first with the story : @entity4 stands alongside victorious @entity198 captain @entity197 after the 1959 @entity23 final			2
