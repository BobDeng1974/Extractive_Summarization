speaking out : professor @entity0 a leading academic says activists are trying to block scientific reports that question the dangers of climate change			1
professor @entity0 said he had been subjected to ‘ unbearable ’ pressure from other researchers and warned of the increasing politicisation of the once ‘ peaceful ’ science			1
others described a ‘ poisonous atmosphere ’ in which researchers plot behind the scenes to block the publication of work that queries the danger posed by climate change			1
prof @entity0 , a top meteorologist attached to @entity18 , spoke out after some of his research was rejected by a leading scientific journal			1
his study suggested carbon dioxide may be less damaging to the planet than feared – effectively challenging the political consensus and the urgency of the taxpayer - funded drive towards green energy			1
an unnamed academic who was asked to help decide if the paper should be published , denounced it as ‘ harmful ’			0
the reviewer also warned it would generate bad publicity and have a ‘ high ’ but ‘ strongly negative ’ impact on the field of climate change science			2
prof @entity0 said having research rejected was ‘ part and parcel of academic life ’ , but added that it would be ‘ utterly unacceptable ’ for an academic to advise against publishing a paper on the grounds that it might bolster the views of climate sceptics			1
he told the @entity48 : ‘ it is an indication of how science is gradually being influenced by political views			0
the problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of climate activist			0
‘ the reality has n’t been keeping up with the [ computer ] models			0
therefore , if people are proposing to do major changes to the world ’s economic system , we must have much more solid information			0
’ however , the publisher of the @entity69 journal said the study contained errors and did not meet its criteria of contributing significant new knowledge			0
prof @entity0 ’s remarks came just days after he resigned from the advisory board of a think - tank that questions the amount of money being poured into combating climate change , after being subject to a ‘ witch - hunt ’ by fellow academics			2
the 79 - year - old said the pressure had become ‘ virtually unbearable ’ and made him fear for his health and safety			2
prof @entity0 , a top meteorologist attached to @entity18 , spoke out after some of his research was rejected by a leading scientific journal in his letter of resignation to the @entity91 , he said : ‘ i would never have expected anything similar in such an original peaceful community as meteorology			1
apparently it has been transformed in recent years			0
’ @entity95 , of the @entity91 , said the professor ’s case was just one example of a ‘ poisonous atmosphere ’ pervading climate change research			1
he said many scientists with dissenting views were having their research rejected by the editors of scientific journals , and young scientists were censoring their work out of fear for their careers			0
dr @entity95 said : ‘ over the last few years , the editors of many of the world ’s leading science journals have publicly advocated drastic policies to curb carbon dioxide emissions			1
at the same time , many have publicly attacked scientists sceptical of the climate alarm			0
‘ instead of serving as open - minded broker of the contested fields of climate science and climate science , most science editors have opted to take a dogmatic stance that no longer allows for open research			2
’ @entity126 , an emeritus professor at @entity127 in @entity128 , said the pressure on @entity132 ‘ simply confirms the worst aspects of politicised science ’			1
the @entity133 , which publishes @entity69 , said the decision to not publish prof @entity0 was based solely on the paper not meeting the journal ’s high standards			2
editorial director @entity138 said : ‘ far from hounding “ dissenting ” views from the field , @entity69 positively encourages genuine scientific innovation that can shed light on complicated climate science			0

professor @entity0 **'s** research suggested carbon dioxide may be less damaging to the planet than feared
says he **'s** been subjected to ' unbearable ' pressure from other researchers
has warned of increasing politicisation of the once ' peaceful ' science
others describe a ' poisonous atmosphere ' *fuelled* by plotting researchers
