by @entity0 a newly married couple from @entity2 ended up calling on a few favors from staff at a waste dump after accidentally throwing away their wedding rings @entity8 from @entity9 had only been married a few days			1
she was taking out the trash and simply did n’t realize that her wedding and engagement rings were in a small ziploc bag next to an empty pizza box			1
in her rush to get to work , she ended up throwing them down the garbage chute but she did n't for several hours that the ring was actually missing			2
mrs @entity8 got married at the start of may and would take her wedding ring set off while she was at work to keep it safe			1
somehow , before her ring made it into her purse for safekeeping , the engagement ring and wedding band wound up on the table next to an old pizza box			0
before long , it was winding its way down the garbage chute along with the rest of the household trash leading directly to a 20 - foot - long and 8 - foot - wide trash compactor			0
in a hurry : @entity8 didn ; t realize what was in the small ziploc bag next to an empty @entity70 ; s pizza box when she dropped it down the garbage chute in her rush to work needle in a haystack : @entity38 emptied five tons of trash from the compactor and went digging for the rings suited & booted : she made a quick stop at the store ; @entity8 bought a hazmat suit , mask and boots			1
she was ready to go dumpster diving found ! @entity84 , a driver with @entity38 , found the rings - they were still in their ziplocked bag after realizing her gut - wrenching mistake , mrs @entity8 called the building manager but he was on vacation			1
' i was frantic , ' @entity8 said			2
' i called @entity38 to see if they would let me open it up and look inside , but they understandably said it was too much of a liability — that it was too toxic and it could crush me			1
@entity95 , a manager at @entity38 told her that although they could n’t open up the trash compactor , they might be able to take a look inside when it was hauled off a week later to be emptied at the landfill			1
very few people were involved in the actual search			0
recovered : @entity105 who looked inside a nearly empty bag with a pizza box on top			0
he pulled apart every piece of junk mail inside until a tiny plastic bag with a wedding ring inside fell out the couple even stopped throwing garbage down the chute so there would be fewer bags to sort through			2
' it was kind of tragic for us , because we just got married and it was such a large expense , ' mrs @entity8 said			1
' i really was already thinking there was no way they were going to find it			0
' on ' dump day ' , five tons of garbage filled the container and mrs @entity8 together with ms @entity95 and @entity84 , a driver with @entity38 , were ready to start looking for the ring			1
the search was done mostly by sight because of the risk of encountering needles and broken glass			0
mrs @entity8 knew she had to look out for a white trash bag carrying a @entity137 box			2
driver , mr @entity84 looked inside a nearly empty bag with a pizza box on top and found a tiny plastic bag with a wedding ring inside			0
mrs @entity8 bought the two employees $ 50 gift cards to a restaurant as a thank you			0
' i did n’t know what else to do , ' @entity8 said			0
