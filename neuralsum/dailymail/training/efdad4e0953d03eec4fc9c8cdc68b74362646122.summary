@entity2 atrocities committed by so - called ' lone - wolf ' fanatics could be prevented by identifying and treating mental illness , new studies suggest			1
a growing body of research has found a significant link between psychological problems and extremist attacks - challenging decades of thinking that they play only a minor role			1
the studies looked at dozens of cases including a radical muslim who killed a soldier outside @entity17 's @entity16 , a right - wing extremist who opened fire on buildings in @entity22 and an @entity24 - inspired assailant who hacked an off - duty soldier to death in @entity27			1
police said all three were terrorists and motivated by ideology , while authorities and family members said they may have been mentally ill. but the latest body of research suggests they might well have been both			2
' it 's never an either - or in terms of ideology versus mental illness , ' said @entity40 , a sociologist at @entity42 's @entity41 who conducted a major study , funded by the @entity44 , of lone wolf extremists			1
' it 's a dangerous cocktail			1
new studies have found a link between mental illness and terror attacks which experts are now using to try to prevent future atrocities terrified : an injured hostage is carried out of a cafe in the central business district of @entity50 after police stormed the building where a gunman had taken hostages and displayed an @entity69 flag killer : prime minister @entity71 said the gunman — @entity72 - born man @entity51 — had ' a long history of violent crime , infatuation with extremism and mental instability ' now academics and law enforcement officials are working to turn that research into tools to prevent deadly attacks			1
the study preceded tuesday 's end to a deadly 16 - hour siege involving a gunman who took hostages in a cafe in @entity50			2
prime minister @entity71 said the gunman — @entity72 - born man @entity51 — had ' a long history of violent crime , infatuation with extremism and mental instability			2
' with groups like @entity93 spreading violence in @entity95 and @entity96 — and bloodthirsty rhetoric on the @entity98 — authorities around the world have issued increasingly insistent warnings about the threat posed by lone wolf attackers			0
they can be difficult to stop with a counterterrorism strategy geared toward intercepting communications and disrupting plots			0
a @entity109 image shows @entity110 running towards the @entity16 buildings in @entity17 after shooting dead a soldier in october before he himself was shot dead by a parliament official an @entity115 police officer runs with his weapon drawn outside @entity117 in @entity115 , @entity17 after a soldier standing guard at the @entity120 was shot by gunman @entity110 - @entity110 after the attack by @entity110 ( above ) , @entity121 , a psychology professor at the @entity122 at @entity123 , told the @entity17 @entity126 's national security committee that ' to believe that radicalized individuals are crazy ... will be our first mistake in developing effective counter-terrorism strategies ' solo terrorism ' does n't take an awful lot of organizing			1
it does n't take too many people to conspire together			0
there 's no great complexity to it , ' @entity27 police chief @entity136 told the @entity140 recently			2
' so what that means is that we have a very short time to interdict , to actually intervene and make sure that these people do n't get away with it			0
' police forces and intelligence agencies are examining whether insights from research by @entity40 and others could help			0
@entity40 said a number of law enforcement and intelligence agencies have shown interest in his work			0
in @entity159 , a police counterterrorism unit is using a major study of lone wolf terrorists to develop risk - assessment analysis			2
a @entity159 security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk on the record said many attackers display warning signs , but that recognizing them is easier in retrospect			0
he said @entity159 intelligence officials are studying the link between mental illness and lone - actor terrorism			1
most people with mental health problems are neither terrorists nor violent , and mental illness alone ca n't explain lone wolf attackers			1
some experts dispute whether there is a link at all			0
after @entity110 's deadly attack on a soldier october 22 in @entity115 , @entity121 , a psychology professor at the @entity122 at @entity123 , told the @entity17 @entity126 's national security committee that ' to believe that radicalized individuals are crazy or not playing with a full deck will be our first mistake in developing effective counterterrorism strategies			1
' but the new research suggests that solo terrorists are much more likely to have mental health problems than either members of the general public or participants in group terrorism			1
@entity40 and @entity196 of @entity197 studied 98 lone wolf attackers in the @entity199 they found that 40 per cent had identifiable mental health problems , compared with 1.5 percent in the general population			1
their conclusion ? mental illness is not the only factor that drives individuals to commit terrorist acts , but it is one of the factors			1
@entity210 said mental illness can play a part ' in shaping particular belief systems and in constructing the enemy , externalizing blame for one 's own failure or grievances onto this all - threatening enemy			1
' @entity221 agents suggested that @entity222 — who is now serving a life sentence in a psychiatric hospital for the murder of soldier @entity226 — be assessed by the agency 's @entity227 , a team of psychologists and social scientists , but the assessment was never done a second study by @entity233 and @entity234 of @entity235 looked at 119 lone wolf attackers and a similar number of members of violent extremist groups in the @entity199 and @entity240			2
almost a third of the lone wolves — nearly 32 percent — had been diagnosed with a mental illness , while only 3.4 percent of terrorist group members were mentally ill. ' group - based terrorists are psychologically quite normal , ' the researchers said			1
they said one reason may be that terrorist recruiters are likely to reject candidates who appear erratic or mentally ill. mental illness could make lone wolf attacks easier to foresee : @entity252 said 60 percent of the attackers he studied leaked details of their plans , sometimes telling friends or family			1
he and corner are working with a @entity159 counterterrorism unit as police try to develop ways of distinguishing genuine threats from hot - headed talk			2
the unit declined to discuss the project , but recent cases suggest determining who really is a threat is fraught with difficulty			0
more than a year before he hacked a soldier to death in @entity27 in 2013 , @entity222 's online extremism drew the attention of @entity159 's intelligence services			2
domestic intelligence agency @entity221 told a parliamentary inquiry into the murder that it uses a range of factors to assess the threat from potential lone wolves , including an inability to cope with stress and anxiety , social isolation and mental health problems			1
@entity221 agents suggested that @entity222 — who is now serving a life sentence in a psychiatric hospital — be assessed by the agency 's @entity227 , a team of psychologists and social scientists , but the assessment was never done			2
the most lethal lone - wolf attacker in recent years was anti-muslim extremist @entity297 , who killed 77 people in a bombing and gun rampage in @entity302 in 2011 floral tributes and candles at the entrance to @entity306 in memory of the 76 people killed by @entity297 the lawmakers ' report called that a missed opportunity , and recommended that ' @entity221 should ensure that the unit 's advice is integrated more thoroughly into investigations			2
' signals also were misread in the case of @entity317 , a 22 - year - old convert to @entity69 who walked into a restaurant in the @entity322 town of @entity323 in 2008 with a homemade bomb			0
the device went off in the restroom , injuring @entity327 and no one else			0
at his trial , jurors were told that @entity327 had learning difficulties and had had many years of contact with mental health services			1
in 2003 , he talked to a psychiatrist about making a bomb			0
the information was passed on to the police , who judged that @entity327 was n't a serious threat			0
@entity199 authorities , in contrast , have been accused of being too aggressive in pursuit of lone attackers			0
the @entity345 has foiled several alleged attacks through sting operations in which agents posed as terror supporters , supplying advice and equipment			0
critics say the strategy can amount to entrapment of mentally vulnerable people who would n't have the wherewithal to act alone			0
meanwhile , the fundamental question of whether there is a link between mental health problems and terrorism remains controversial			1
the most lethal lone - wolf attacker in recent years was anti-muslim extremist @entity297 , who killed 77 people in a bombing and gun rampage in @entity302 in 2011			0
one psychiatric report found him to be insane , while a second concluded that he was sane — and judges agreed , sending him to prison indefinitely			0
the killer was happy with the outcome			0
for @entity297 , it was recognition that his views were legitimate and not those of a madman .			0

new studies challenge thinking that mental illness plays only a minor role
dozens of attacks analysed including soldier shot by @entity17 parliament
found that fanatics are often motivated by both ideology and mental health
