could you imagine living without ever hearing music ? concerts and songs are often taken for granted by many people with full hearing , but its an activity deaf people ca n't enjoy in the same way			1

the concert was then performed to 19 - year - old @entity18 who was born deaf , and wears a cochlear implant to boost the sounds she can hear			1
the concert of 400 people was created as part of the @entity32 scheme the concert of 400 people was created as part of the @entity32 scheme			0
to ensure the sounds were audible to ms @entity35 , the song was composed from scratch using the frequencies her cochlear implant enables her to hear			1
@entity18 started to hear a small number of musical notes when she received the implant two years ago			2
because she had limited awareness of the type of music she may like , she asked the public to help her choose the song , via social media			0

speaking at the event , @entity18 said : ‘ my night could n't get any better ! ' the way @entity10 conducted his orchestra and created the purest sound gave me goosebumps			0
‘ and the atmosphere was amazing , i had such a good time with my family and friends			0
even though i will never hear exactly the same as everyone else , tonight i felt that i came extremely close			0
' the melodies were so diverse and i would have never been able to distinguish the different sounds if it was n't for @entity10			0
i ’m over the moon ! ’ the concert was then performed to 19 - year - old @entity135 ( pictured right ) who was born deaf , and has a cochlear implant to boost the sounds she can hear			1

' it was definitely a challenge to arrange the song for @entity18 , but when i saw her enjoying every moment during the concert , i knew it was mission accomplished			0
’ audiologist @entity149 from the @entity151 ’s largest hearing loss charity action on @entity152 , formerly @entity153 , added : ‘ @entity154 , which @entity18 now wears , can be an option for people who have little or no hearing and are not benefiting from hearingaids			2
' they can improve people 's ability to hear and understand speech however the results of cochlear implants vary depending on the individual			0
‘ it ’s great that @entity18 was able to enjoy her first musical experience with the help of @entity10 through @entity32			2
’ because she had limited awareness of the type of music she may like , ms @entity18 asked the public , via social media , to choose the song			1
ms @entity18 was also able to lip - read her brother @entity69 on her phone ( pictured ) and communicate in a more direct way than before - another first for the teenager @entity180 's version sounds lower than the original , ( above ) but is still recognisable to people with full hearing			1

musician @entity10 composed a song for 19 - year - old @entity135
ms @entity18 was born deaf and a cochlear implant gives her limited hearing
@entity10 worked with *van* @entity18 to discover what frequencies she can hear
he then modified @entity52 ’s @entity51 to match these frequencies
the song sounds lower than the original , but is still recognisable to people with full hearing
