by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 18 november 2013 a family laid flowers at someone else ’s grave for 13 years after a headstone was placed on the wrong plot			1
the heartbreaking mistake only came to light after @entity10 ’s mother died last month at the age of 82 , and arrangements were made for her to be interred with her husband @entity13 in the family plot			1
mr @entity13 was buried at @entity16 ’s @entity15 after his death at the age of 70 in october 2000			0
for the next 13 years mrs @entity10 , along with his widow @entity19 , regularly attended the grave			1
mourning : @entity10 , who discovered that her late father 's headstone had been placed on the wrong grave - an error that only came to light 13 years later when her mum died but , unknown to them , mr @entity13 was buried in an adjacent plot and they were putting flowers on the grave of a complete stranger , which was dug at the same time as mr @entity13 ’s			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' it ’s been a terrible experience			1
it was only after my mum died , which was traumatic enough , that the discovery was made that the plot number for my dad ’s grave did n’t match the headstone , and for all this time i have been laying flowers on the wrong grave			1
' i just broke down when the funeral director told me			1
' she added : ' it mainly fell to me to look after it as other members of the family have moved away and i was the main carer for both my mum and dad before they passed away			0
' no - one wants to say they ’re to blame			2
it ’s not about compensation – all the money in the world is n’t going to change what happened			0
' my main concern is people are made aware that these things can happen			0
' i ’ve always been against cremation , but after this i ’ve told my children i want to be cremated because i do n’t want to put them through what i ’ve been through			2
' enduring love : @entity71 and her husband , @entity72			0
the family had been tending to the grave of another man and placing flowers on it every week for more than a decade a spokesman for @entity16 council , which owns @entity15 , said : ' the responsibility for the installation of a headstone lies with memorial masons			2
we provide memorial masons with cemetery section maps and any assistance they request over directions			0
' quite clearly this service was not requested by the memorial mason at that time			0
we do not escort masons to graves			0
' the error in placing this headstone came to light when cemeteries staff were making preparations for a burial in the family grave			2
' the stonemasons , @entity102 of @entity103 , have agreed to inscribe the headstone free of charge before it is put on the family plot , while stressing this was not an admission of liability for the mix - up			1
owner @entity111 said : ' it ’s a sad situation and somewhere along the line someone has made a mistake , but as to who that is , it ’s a never - ending circle			0
' there were two fresh graves dug at the same time , so there was another , out - of - town stonemason involved in placing the headstone on the other grave			2

@entity10 *thought* she was *paying* *respects* at the grave of her father
she has discovered he was in a different plot after gravestone mix - up
mrs @entity10 has tended the grave of a stranger for more than a decade
she said : ' i just broke down when the funeral director told me '
