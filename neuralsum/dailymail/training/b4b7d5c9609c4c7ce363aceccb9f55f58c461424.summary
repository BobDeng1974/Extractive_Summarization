the ebola virus is continuing its rampage throughout @entity2 with the number of people infected doubling every three to four weeks			2
so far , more than 8,000 people are thought to have contracted the disease , and almost half of those have died , according to the @entity8			1
in the battle to stem the virus , health organisations are turning towards data generated by social media and mobile technology - with some hoping it may even help find a cure			1
the initiative was started by the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) in an effort to source information about household food security for those at risk			2
so far , more than 850 people have responded to a survey which was sent to mobile phone subscribers randomly by location , and involved answering ten text messages			1
' [ an ] advantage of mobile data collection is that is it quicker than sending around teams to do face to face surveys around the country , ' said @entity54 - @entity53 , a @entity36 food security analyst			0
researchers are collecting mobile phone mast activity data from operators and mapping where calls to helplines are located			0

the amount of data is usually so large that it requires a computer to process the information , rather than just a person or group of people			0
big data is usually used to better understand human behaviour and trends within society - both on the small scale and globally			0
' in a public health emergency , where the situation of communities is changing by the week , this helps @entity36 have more timely information to shape our response			0
' the @entity102 and @entity102 also hope to extend a text message - based system used to advise people about @entity21 in to seven @entity2 nations			1
the facility will allow the charities to send sms messages to every switched - on handset in an area by drawing its shape on a computer - generated map			0
meanwhile , the @entity114 has started sending @entity116 alerts that include short audio clips and low - resolution photos to people threatened by @entity21			1
within just four hours of launching the service , more than 1,000 people signed up for its @entity21 alerts , which are sent in both @entity122 and @entity123			1
as well as sending alerts , technology is helping health agencies monitor trends in outbreaks by their speed , number and location			1

move the markers on the bottom bar to change the date this year has seen the worst outbreak in history of the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			2
the outbreak has a mortality rate of around 50 per cent			0
this scene shows bodies being taken away in @entity22 one example is @entity146 's @entity145 which flagged up a ' mystery haemorrhagic fever ' nine days before the @entity8 announced the @entity21 epidemic			1
the fever was seen developing in the forested areas of southeastern guinea by a free online tool known as @entity145 on march 19			1
@entity21 emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in @entity154 and near the @entity155 in the @entity156			1
there are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent			0
in the current outbreak that is just over 50 per cent			0
it is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats , which are eaten as a delicacy			0
the virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people			0
symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			2
people are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days			2
although the disease has no cure , modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down			0
the @entity200 group behind the software started putting out alerts and providing information to the @entity8 , which reported its first confirmed case of @entity21 on march 23			1
since then , the @entity145 team has created an interactive @entity21 map , free to use by anyone who wants to see where the disease is spreading			1
the map , run by scientists in @entity212 , uses algorithms to scour tens of thousands of social media sites , local news and government websites to detect and track disease outbreaks			1
it then filters out irrelevant data to identify dangerous diseases and map their locations with the help of health experts			0
' it shows some of these informal sources are helping paint a picture of what 's happening that 's useful to these public health agencies , ' said @entity145 co-founder @entity230			1
@entity21 is transmitted by human contact , which means knowing where people are moving can provide valuable insight to researchers trying to contain the outbreak			1
' big data has really changed epidemiology , ' @entity236 , director of @entity238 's @entity237 and @entity239 told @entity242			0
mr @entity236 has been working with the @entity200 @entity243 for almost a decade to help track diseases like and predict how they might spread			0
in addition to using information send via text message , the team have turned to updates on social networks such as @entity252 and @entity253			2
a project by the group , dubbed ' # @entity256 ' , gathers the data put out by local ministries of health and publishes the results online			0
meanwhile , the @entity261 ( @entity261 ) is collecting mobile phone mast activity data from operators and mapping where calls to helplines are located			0
while this data has proved valuable , experts claim that more resources are needed to analyse the data faster			0
if they manage this , scientists believe big data analytics could help provide an off - the - shelf @entity21 vaccine			2
but that may still be some way off			0
' we 're learning all this from scratch - we 've never had this level of data before , ' @entity278 's @entity277 told the @entity114			1
' so it 's probably too early to say whether big data analytics is having a meaningful impact on the rate and spread of the disease , but at least it is helping us decide where to allocate our resources			2
' @entity21 is transmitted by human contact , which means knowing where people are moving can provide valuable insight to researchers trying to contain the outbreak			2
@entity296 and @entity297 are thought to be the worst affected areas			0

so far , more than 8,000 people are thought to have contracted the disease , and almost half of those have died
text messages are helping in the fight against @entity21 in @entity22 with people receiving health text alerts
@entity114 has started sending @entity116 alerts that include short audio clips and photos to people at risk from @entity21
as well as sending alerts , social media is helping health agencies monitor trends in outbreaks by their location
@entity146 's @entity145 flagged a ' haemorrhagic fever ' nine days before @entity21 was formally announced
