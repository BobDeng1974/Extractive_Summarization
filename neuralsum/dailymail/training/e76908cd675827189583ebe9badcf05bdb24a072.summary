@entity1 agent : @entity3 agent ' @entity2 ' is today unmasked as humble bank clerk @entity4 a lone @entity6 agent who neutralised hundreds of @entity7 during the @entity8 is today unmasked as a modest suburban bank clerk whose civilian bosses had considered him nothing ‘ special ’			1
the ‘ genius ’ undercover operative managed to infiltrate and control @entity14 sympathisers living in @entity15 – preventing them from passing intelligence to @entity17			0
information he prevented ever reaching @entity21 ’s henchmen included the need for a ‘ renewed blitz , with more bomb damage aimed at undermining public morale ’			0
until today , the agent had been known only by his pseudonym , @entity2			1
but @entity29 files reveal his real identity was @entity31 , a father - of - two from @entity32			1
born in 1907 and educated in @entity33 , he spent 15 years working for @entity34 without managers noticing anything remarkable about his skills			1
indeed , senior staff expressed surprise when the @entity29 requested @entity4 ’ release in 1940			2
assistant controller @entity42 wrote : ‘ what we would like to know here is – what are the particular and especial qualifications of mr @entity4 – which we have not been able to perceive ? ’ in fact , he had been identified by @entity48 – @entity6 ’s top agent runner – as a potentially huge asset			1
one @entity6 officer described @entity4 as ‘ thoroughly familiar with everything connected with the various @entity54 organisations in this country ’			1
according to his personal record sheet , he had only a ‘ slight ’ knowledge of @entity58 , although he had twice visited the country on holidays in the 1930s			2
he had , however , somehow acquired a knowledge of the @entity54 groups operating in @entity64 in the period before the outbreak of the @entity8 – although how he came to do so is not disclosed in the documents			1
he was also a ju - jitsu enthusiast – having been a member of the @entity70 – which may have proved handy for a secret agent			2
upon being liberated from the bank ’s @entity73 branch in @entity75 , @entity4 was deployed to infiltrate groups of traitors by security chiefs alarmed at the strength of support for @entity21 in some parts of @entity15			1
by posing as an undercover @entity83 officer , @entity4 was able to control groups of ‘ @entity85 ’ who were trying to aid the @entity88 cause			0
mr @entity4 was picked out by @entity6 , which spent much of the war headquartered in @entity90 ( above ) the @entity14 sympathisers believed they were successfully passing secrets to @entity17 – but all the while the information was being handed straight to @entity6			1
by the end of the war , @entity4 had monitored and controlled the activities of hundreds of would - be traitors			0
the @entity14 sympathisers , based mainly in @entity75 and the south of @entity15 , used messages written in invisible ink and other ruses to pass details of @entity105 operations and intelligence on jet propulsion and radar systems			0
had the network not been penetrated , it could have done significant harm , @entity6 said			2
the traitors were never prosecuted , to avoid blowing future operations , and went to their graves believing they had helped @entity21			0
the files contain numerous accounts of @entity2 ’s meetings with @entity14 sympathisers , including one from april 1943 with three women who were discussing a recent @entity58 air raid			2
he wrote : ‘ a nearby school clinic was hit and @entity121 said with a grin that one expectant mother was killed , two girls badly injured , a clerk and two children killed			0
‘ i looked in vain at the faces of these three women for signs of contrition			0
@entity121 looked a fine , healthy specimen of an @entity132 , but it was obvious the deaths of these people meant absolutely nothing to her			0
’ some of ‘ @entity2 ’s ’ exploits first came to light in february , when an initial batch of @entity6 papers relating to his courage were declassified			1
the files do not disclose what happened to @entity4 after the war			0
