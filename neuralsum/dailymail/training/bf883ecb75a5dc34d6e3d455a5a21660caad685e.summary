they will draw inspiration from the one and only other time @entity3 have lifted this trophy - just four years ago when they beat @entity13 2 - 1 in @entity14			1
that talented side featured the likes of @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
but what became of the other members of the class of 2010 ? @entity25 tracks their careers since their @entity28 triumph			1

remaining understudy to @entity51 , he enjoyed two profitable loan spells at @entity53 in @entity54 and was attracting a great deal of interest from top clubs			0
in the end , after representing @entity58 at the @entity59 , he moved to @entity61 for £ 3.5m on deadline day in january 2013			0
now 21 , @entity18 has been unable to displace @entity63 as no 1 and spent the last season on loan at @entity66 and @entity67			2
aerial battle : goalkeeper @entity18 comes to claim a cross under pressure from defender @entity71 and @entity13 's @entity72 @entity73 was highly - regarded at @entity74 and had signed a four - year deal in 2010			1

he spent last season on loan at @entity177 and then @entity74 and has made 13 appearances for the @entity3 under 21 side			2
eyes on the prize : @entity158 is challenged by @entity111 player @entity182 during this week 's @entity2 21 international @entity183 one of the brightest prospects to emerge from the @entity186 academy , @entity183 followed up his @entity3 success by guiding @entity188 to @entity166 success against @entity132 in 2011			1
stepping up to the reserves , he was rewarded with a senior debut in the @entity89 tie with @entity193 in october 2011 and a @entity125 debut later that year			0
niggling knee injuries checked his progress until this season , where he spent time on loan at @entity199 and @entity200 , helping the @entity202 side to the @entity171 - off final			2

@entity160 appeared to have grand plans for him but opportunities were limited and @entity20 ended up on loan at first @entity113 , then @entity74 , @entity169 and @entity199			0
the latter was fairly profitable , helping the @entity242 to the @entity243 and an @entity139 semi-final , where he played against @entity206			0
waiting for a chance : @entity20 , seen here playing for @entity247 in 2010 , has spent much of his time out on loan @entity17 the outstanding success story of the @entity142 , @entity17 has advanced from under 17 talent to member of @entity254 's @entity101 squad and a @entity125 regular in just four years			1

his performances for @entity284 in the @entity28 persuaded the @entity281 to shell out £ 11m for him in the summer of 2011 but he has n't shown consistent form for them until this year			0
a loan spell at @entity271 , where he scored eight times in 13 appearances , helped set up a storming end to the season in which crucial goals against @entity294 , @entity160 and @entity295 kept @entity281 in the big time			0
great escape : @entity21 scored five crucial goals to keep @entity281 in the @entity125 the rest of the squad @entity301 highly - rated @entity188 academy product who has not yet made a first - team appearance but has enjoyed profitable loan spells elsewhere			1
