the only problem with staying on a resort in the @entity2 is you can never quite believe it 's real			1
particularly when the ' hotel ' you 're staying in is in fact an entire island with fine white sand , lush green foliage and colourful birds and blooms			2
the @entity15 in deepening shades of azure stretches out ahead in all directions with a stunning reef nearby @entity19 , where you can walk around the 30 - villa island in five minutes that 's @entity19 for you ; the newest venture from @entity23			1
on the small end of your average @entity28 island , the privacy it offers attracts famous faces such as recent guest @entity30			2
having just reopened in february 2014 it boasts slick , modern @entity36 architecture throughout , a gorgeous library and telescope for light pollution - free stargazing - they 've even got a special app to explain the constellations			2
i spent one heavenly night in a duplex pool villa here - a two storey home from home with an outdoor bathroom at the back stretching to the sea , a kitchenette , bar and large double bedroom with balcony			2
one night in a duplex pool villa : a self contained two storey home from home			2

steam , extraction and massage were used to make my skin smooth , plump and glow all evening and throughout the trip			0
after an afternoon of stand up paddleboarding , we settled down for dinner at the @entity77 restaurant where i ordered a melt - in - the - mouth wagyu steak			0

the next island , @entity89 , has 129 villas , several bars and restaurants , plus an abundance of daily activities , making it perfect for a group trip or girlie getaway as well as families and couples			1
if you 're feeling extra hedonistic , go when one of the famous monthly full moon parties take place			0
they 're hosted on the resort 's exceptionally wide stretches of beach and celebrity djs spin music into the night			0
@entity89 's water villas are of incredible standard , even in the @entity2 , and my room was an exceptional water bungalow with a pool looking out onto the ocean through a glass wall			1
swim for your supper : the room at @entity89 was a beautiful water bungalow with its own pool bedrooms look out onto the ocean and guests have their own private infinity pool the @entity125 provides an ideal setting for watching the sunset in a designer wicker chair after a dip in my private infinity pool and a cool shower ( with @entity135 toiletries , of course ) , i headed to the nearby watering hole @entity125 , an ideal setting for watching the sunset while eating top - notch tapas			1
later , on a champagne sunset cruise aboard a traditional @entity28 fishing vessel called a @entity144 boat , i laid back on a giant bean bag while sipping cool @entity146 as the sun sank into the horizon			0
the next day was spent on a private paradise in the shape of a deserted sandbank out in the ocean - an excursion called @entity154 , complete with champagne , sushi and other culinary delights			0
full moon parties take place on @entity89 's wide sandy beaches ( pictured - @entity161 and a @entity144 boat ) children are of course welcome at @entity89 but there 's no kids club - worth bearing in mind			1
the third and final stop on my trip was the family - friendly island of @entity171			1
with 300 villas it 's the biggest of the three and offers a buggy service to get you from a to @entity177 i marvelled at a 300 - year - old twisted stunning banyan tree , one of the oldest in the @entity2 , which sported sky - high twisted branches of story - book beanstalk beauty			1
this , paired with the island 's hydroponic garden and eco centre housing a giant sperm whale skeleton makes @entity189 a uniquely educational offering in the @entity2			1
the water sports and activities on offer are extensive			0
on a snorkeling tour , majestic reef sharks roamed and giant turtles swam up to greet us while tropical and colourful clownfish and butterflyfish went about their business			0
the marine biologist on duty , @entity202 , was fun as well as knowledgeable			0
with 300 villas , @entity171 is the biggest of the three and offers a buggy service to get you from a to b @entity171 's eco centre makes the island a wonderfully educational destination after a day of activities and an indulgent dinner at world cuisine eaterie @entity213 , we sank into bean bag chairs for after - dinner cocktails at @entity217 , where live acoustic music created a relaxed atmosphere			1
