failed to assist : dr @entity0 on thursday a gp refused to help an 88 - year - old woman who fell and knocked herself unconscious in front of his surgery because he was ‘ not first - aid trained ’			1
@entity8 had just got off a bus when she collapsed , cutting her head and injuring her arm			1
@entity12 - by @entity13 found her knocked out and dashed into the practice to ask for help , but said staff were ‘ completely uninterested ’			2
when she persisted , locum @entity0 was approached , but he refused to leave his office			1
@entity19 even declined to supply a blanket to make mrs @entity8 comfortable until an ambulance came			1
the widow was eventually taken to hospital where she remains more than a week later			1
yesterday , mrs @entity13 said she was ‘ completely disgusted ’ with the surgery			2
the mother - of - two was visiting @entity26 and @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , with her daughter when she heard a ‘ big bang ’			2
referring to mrs @entity8 , she added : ‘ she had got off at the wrong bus stop and was really confused			1
‘ i think she tried to cross the road but then fell over and banged her head			0
her arm was trapped underneath her and her hearing aid had fallen out			0
she was unconscious for about five or ten minutes			0
‘ i ran straight into the doctor ’s and thought they would have come straight out , but the receptionist was really rude			0
there was no urgency and she seemed completely uninterested			0
she eventually went to get the doctor but she came out of his office and just said there was nothing he could do			1
’ mrs @entity13 , who runs a cake business , was forced to call 999 herself and was advised to get a defibrillator because mrs @entity8 had a pacemaker			1
but the surgery refused to hand one over			1
the following day , she complained to practice manager @entity53 who told her dr @entity0 was not first - aid trained and the surgery had been sued several times for treating people in similar circumstances			1
after mrs @entity8 injured herself on september 18 , a paramedic in a rapid - response car arrived within five minutes , but it took another 30 minutes for an ambulance to turn up and take her to @entity65 in @entity28			1
mrs @entity13 has visited her there and says she has a bandaged head and a cast on her right arm			2
neither the pensioner , who lives alone in sheltered accommodation in @entity28 , nor her family wanted to discuss her ordeal yesterday			0
it ’s very sad and shocking that no one from the surgery would help her			0
’ dr @entity0 , 62 , declined to comment when approached at the surgery yesterday , and left in a @entity90 with a personalised number plate			1
he said : ‘ i have been told not to speak to the @entity92			0
’ dr @entity0 and mr @entity53 also refused to confirm whether he had received first - aid training			1
the @entity94 - born gp , of @entity95 , @entity96 , graduated in the @entity98 state at the @entity99 in 1977 and trained at the @entity100 and the @entity101 in @entity102			2
he qualified in 1989 and moved on to the gp register in 2006			0
the @entity104 last night said members were not automatically trained in first aid but there is a ‘ @entity109 principle ’ under which all @entity111 doctors have medical indemnity whoever they treat , even if it is not one of their patients			1
it also pointed to a @entity119 document , duties of a doctor , that states medical professionals must ‘ show respect for human life ’ at all times			0
spokesman dr @entity125 added : ‘ there is no legal reason for not helping			0
’ the surgery has written to mrs @entity13 to explain it had held a ‘ robust ’ conversation with the two receptionists on duty when she came in			2
they have been told their ‘ response to the situation was inadequate and not acceptable ’			0
the letter said : ‘ the policy now makes it clear to all staff ( clinicians and receptionists ) how they are to respond to any such event			0
‘ this includes making it mandatory for a doctor to respond and that reception staff take responsibility for contacting ambulance services			2
’ in a statement , the practice said it was ‘ reviewing procedures to ensure this does not happen again ’			1
the case is the latest in which public servants refused to act because of health and safety concerns or red tape			0
@entity159 , 41 , drowned in 3ft of water when a paramedic and a police officer were ordered not to wade in to help			0
