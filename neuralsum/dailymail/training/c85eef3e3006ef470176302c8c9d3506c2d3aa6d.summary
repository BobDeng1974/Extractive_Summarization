by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 07:13 est , 1 may 2013 standing atop his column in @entity3 , @entity1 may soon be forced to stare down at a reminder of the nation he defeated - in the form of a giant electric blue cockerel			1
the 15ft - tall fibreglass bird , designed by @entity10 artist @entity9 , is due to be placed on the fourth plinth on july 20			1
but a conservation group , headed by a senior judge , has opposed the planned installation , saying it is ' totally inappropriate ' for the site in central @entity16			1
the cock is the national symbol of @entity19 - and the @entity20 claims the artwork is unsuitable , given @entity1 defeated the @entity19 navy at the @entity23 in 1805			1
this 15ft - tall fibreglass bird , designed by @entity10 artist @entity9 , is due to be placed on the fourth plinth on july 20 conservation group the @entity20 has opposed the planned installation , saying it is ' totally inappropriate ' for the site in central @entity16			1
the cock is the national symbol of @entity19 - and @entity1 defeated the @entity19 navy at the @entity23 in 1805 in a letter to @entity27 , the society 's chairman @entity28 , wrote : ' we can not see any logical reason for the proposed sculpture to be placed on the fourth plinth			1
' it is unrelated to the context of @entity3 and adds nothing to it but a feeble distraction			0
' the letter from the group , which has @entity40 sir @entity39 as its president , continued that the artist 's claim that the ' cockerel is a symbol for regeneration , awakening and strength ' was weak			0
nor were the campaigners impressed with @entity9 's boast that the giant bird should be viewed as ' a rude interruption to the grey formal architecture of the square ' , according to the @entity54			2
the society - whose patrons include musician @entity58 and @entity60 politician @entity59 , and counts conservative mp @entity61 as vice president - has just days to convince the council , which has recommended the plans be approved by next tuesday			0
and this is how it could soon look ... @entity9 told @entity27 her artwork ( pictured here using an artist 's impression ) provoked mischief by being put in a square that celebrates victory over the @entity19 speaking on the controversy surrounding the sculpture , entitled @entity76 , councillor @entity77 , deputy leader of @entity27 , told the @entity78 : ' i ’m sure if this gets planning permission , it will cause quite a stir , particularly because it will be placed under the gaze of admiral @entity1			1
' however , i do wonder what @entity1 ’s reaction would have been after returning home from battle only to be greeted by the @entity19 emblem standing proudly in the centre of @entity16			1
' in her defence , @entity9 told the council that her artwork provoked mischief by being put in a square that celebrates victory over the @entity19 - and would act as a ' species interloper ' at a place famed for attracting pigeons			2
in a sign that the council is likely to approve the installation , it said any perceived harm to the conservation area would be ' offset by the public interest ' in the public art. a member of the @entity108 , @entity109 , said : ' if you want a sculpture that looks like something that was made over 500 years ago , it 's not going to be an interesting sculpture			0
' @entity115 , by @entity116 the fourth plinth in @entity3 was originally intended for an equestrian statue but has remained unfilled for 150 years			2
but since 1998 , it has been used to showcase a rotating collection of artworks ... ... but would n't @entity122 be a more fitting choice ? a statue of @entity125 could be erected in @entity3 under plans being considered by ministers			0
@entity128 gave the idea of a permanent memorial to the former prime minister its backing as defence secretary @entity133 revealed the fourth plinth in @entity3 ‘ could be one of the options ’			2
@entity136 also came out in support of the idea , which has been publicly backed by former military personnel who served in the victorious @entity141 campaign in 1982			0
there is a growing clamour for a statue to be placed in central @entity16 on public view , to mark @entity125 ’s immense impact on @entity147			0
in particular there are calls to use the vacant plinth in the shadow of @entity1 's column in @entity3 , at the opposite end of @entity154 from the @entity155			0
however , there are concerns that any memorial could become the target of vandals and protests , after police clashed with revellers at hate - filled street parties ‘ celebrating ’ @entity125 ’s death on monday at the age of 87 .			0
