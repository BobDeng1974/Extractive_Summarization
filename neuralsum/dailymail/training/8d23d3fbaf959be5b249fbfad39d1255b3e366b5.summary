in a letter dated july 12 , published on the committee ’s website on wednesday , sir @entity80 – a former @entity92 mandarin – said publishing the information could ‘ substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations by tainting them with public association with criminality ’			1
the evidence has now been ‘ formally classified ’ , he added			0
detailing his reasons , he said there was a ‘ lack of certainty ’ over whether the investigators ’ clients had ‘ guilty knowledge ’ and were aware of what was going on			0
and he said naming them could undermine their right to a private and family life under the @entity24			1
he also cited the ‘ possible prejudice which any publication might have on ongoing criminal investigations and future regulatory action ’			0
he wrote : ‘ this reflects the fact that the information it contains , if published , might prejudice individual security or liberty , impede the investigation ( or facilitate the commission ) of serious crime or substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations by tainting them with public association with criminality			0
’ the list of clients stems from a @entity130 investigation codenamed @entity131 which led to the jailing of four private detectives in january last year			2
