@entity0 was left with a face as red as his shirt after offering up a contender for miss of the season in @entity8 's @entity7 qualifier with @entity9			1
the striker inexplicably fired wide when played through one - on - one with goalkeeper @entity11 after 32 minutes of the match at the @entity13			2
it looked easier for the @entity16 man to find the net from such point - blank range but his attempted dink was scuffed and went past the far post			1
@entity0 buries his head in his shirt after an embarrassing miss for @entity8 in their match with @entity9 the @entity16 striker was played clean through on goal and had only goalkeeper @entity11 to beat @entity11 attempted to narrow the angle as @entity0 shaped to shoot but it still looked an easy chance the goalkeeper goes to ground as @entity0 tries to dink the ball past him and into the gaping goal but the striker turns away in horror as the ball drops wide of the far post the @entity9 goalkeeper and defenders ca n't believe their good fortune as @entity0 's shot drops wide the striker lifts his shirt over his head in embarrassment but his blushes were spared by an offside flag @entity0 has been in outstanding form since joining @entity16 , scoring nine goals in nine matches as @entity0 lifted his shirt over his head in embarrassment , he would have been relieved to learn that he 'd been flagged offside though he had no idea initially			1
@entity0 is in sensational form for his club , with nine goals in nine matches since his £ 32m move from @entity55 in the summer , but has struggled to find the net for his country			1
he squandered a succession of chances during the first half , as goals by @entity62 and his strike partner @entity63 gave @entity8 a commanding lead over the @entity66 minnows			1
but he did eventually score his first goal for his country , firing home in the second half to make it 3 - 0 from close range			1
the relief on his face was apparent for all to see			0
@entity73 scored a late fourth goal to round off the comprehensive victory			1
@entity0 ( second left ) is mobbed by his team - mates after breaking his duck with a second - half goal @entity80 's team desperately needed a morale - boosting win after a shock defeat to @entity84 on thursday			1

i did not score , and the team lost the games i played			0
i did not know how i was going to score			0
' but thanks to @entity92 the ball dropped for me , and i just had to put it in			2
i must thank the boss , every game was another chance for me to show what i can do			2
i hope from now things will go well for me			0
' and coach @entity80 added : ' we ’re all happy he has scored			0
he worked hard , lacked luck in front of goal			0
he will be a useful player for us			0
