more than £ 30million - worth of @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 emerged from the ill - fated carrier ship yesterday , after it ran aground off the @entity6 coast three weeks ago			1
but among the dented doors and scratched paintwork emerged a perfectly preserved armoured personnel carrier			1
the @entity10 was carrying 1,400 luxury cars including a £ 260,000 rolls @entity12 on january 3 , when it was deliberately grounded on @entity14 in the @entity15 to stop it capsizing			1
a spokesman for the shipping company described the damage to the cars as ' limited ' but there are fears the entire fleet could have to be scrapped after a similar accident in 2006 wrecked 4,700 mazdas			1
the cars were sent to the crusher after transporter @entity28 partially capsized in the @entity30 while carrying the cars away from the factory			2
it was left resting for just over three weeks - a similar length of time to the @entity35 - at an angle of 60 degrees			2
this @entity69 was left with large scratches and dents to its bodywork a spokesman for the shipping line described the damage yesterdayas ' limited ' , but in 2006 a shipment of @entity25 in a similar condition were destroyed after resting at sea for three weeks at an angle of 60 degrees - almost identical conditions to the @entity81 initially a @entity83 spokesman said that only 68 cars had been damaged in the crash , either by slipping their moorings or rolling into other vehicles , but it was eventually decided that all 4,700 vehicles needed to be crushed			1
engineers were worried about what effect resting at such a severe angle for so long would have on the inner workings of the cars , especially on the electrolyte in the batteries			2
rather than open themselves up to the possibility of lawsuits due to mechanical faults , the company decided that it was safer to scrap the lot			0
the @entity81 was deliberately run aground after it started to list at 52 degrees , a similar angle to the @entity28 , just after leaving @entity106 port			1
a spokesman for @entity108 said that each car was being inspected after being removed from the ship , and that a decision about their fate would not be made until that task was complete			1
it is not yet known what , if any , damaged was sustained by the @entity117			0
if it is decided that all the vehicles need to be disposed of then the total bill will run into the tens of millions of pounds			0
even if the cars are deemed road worthy , some of the new owners will still be left disappointed after the vehicles were pictured arriving on shore yesterday with dents and scratches to the bodywork			1
back ashore : a red @entity130 f - type is driven back on to dry land after spending three weeks stranded on board the @entity35 valuable : the ship 's cargo is thought to be worth £ 30million , leaving a huge bill for the accident if the cars have to be written off dozens of @entity0 are on board , as well as @entity1 , and the incident could run into costs of tens of millions of pounds of damage @entity83 engineers were concerned about what effect resting at such a severe angle would have on the cars , particularly on the electrolytes in the batteries			1
if inspectors take the same decision over the @entity81 ( pictured ) , then the bill for the accident could run into tens of millions the transporter was also carrying up to 80 agricultural or building plant machines , including a large stone - cutter machine weighing more than 30 tonnes			2
high winds and heavy rain hampered the rescue operation - even causing one of the tugs to smash into the @entity81 as it was being towed			0
it was brought back to land last week so that its precious cargo could be unloaded			0
all of the cargo , which includes the cars and other equipment , will be taken off the ship by the end of this week or early next week , according to @entity108			0
a spokesman for @entity108 ' @entity170 said : ' there is only limited damage to the cargo			2
' most of the lashings held , and only a couple of pieces - large machinery - shifted			0
saved from the sea : dock workers in @entity106 help to drive a fleet of @entity0 back on to shore after the ship they were on was run aground to stop it capsizing safe : these @entity0 were just one part of a valuable cargo that included @entity1 , @entity51 , and a @entity186 thought to be worth £ 260,000 on its own line ' em up : the cars are moved into position at @entity106 docks yesterday after the craft they were being carried on , the @entity10 , was towed back to dry land after three weeks stranded in the @entity6 channel the ship arrived at @entity106 on january 22 and crews yesterday began removing cars stowed on board , including @entity1 and @entity0 officials said a full assessment of the damage would need to be carried out before it was decided what would happen to the large fleet of cars ' water damage only occured on the lowest deck and on the one side the ship was listing			1
' it is not yet known which vehicles were damaged by the sea water inside the ship and the spokesman said the vehicles were owned by ' a variety of parties ' - including dealers and private owners			2
cars which are damaged or do not start up will be towed off the ship			2
the spokesman said only preliminary checks had been carried out at this stage and a full assessment would be completed once every car was back on dry land , so they could make a decision about what to do with damaged vehicles			2
the @entity232 - registered @entity10 was heading to the @entity233 was deliberately grounded when it started to list just 45 minutes after leaving the port of @entity106			1
vehicles , many seemingly undamaged , were seen rolling off the ship , and it could take up to a week for all the cars to be removed from it the @entity10 was stranded in the @entity15 from january 3 after it started listing at about 9.20pm , 45 minutes into a journey to @entity243 salvage firm @entity245 managed to complete ballast management to reduce the list of the ship to five degrees and it was towed back to shore the 25 person crew had to be rescued by @entity252 and a coastguard helicopter with two people suffering non-life threatening injuries during the incident			1

it was then towed to @entity327 by four tugs.during its journey , an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place , set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side			0
airspace was also restricted to one mile around the route as a precaution			0

cars had dents and scratches , even though a spokesman for the shipping line described the damage as ' limited '
but armoured personnel carrier looked completely untouched as it was driven off the ship at @entity106 port
the @entity10 was deliberately grounded in the @entity15 on january 3 after it started to list at a 52 degree angle
now , the entire fleet may need to be scrapped after a similar accident in 2006 led to 4,700 @entity25 being crushed
