but @entity6 will argue he should only pay back £ 8m of his criminal proceeds			2
‘ the prosecution figure of over £ 34m arises from the application of three statutory assumptions in the proceeds of crime act ’ , said mr @entity57			2
‘ the figure under the first assumption of £ 17.5m is made up principally of money transferred into bank accounts during that six year period			0
‘ we assume any of the property held by the defendant at any time after the date of conviction , may 19 , 2011 , was obtained by him as a result of general criminal conduct			0

‘ has @entity6 succeeded in convincing that it was not correct to make the statutory assumption that 33 @entity103 represents proceeds of general criminal conduct ? ‘ has @entity6 shown there would be a serious risk of injustice if that assumption were made ? ’ mr @entity57 added both defence and prosecution agree @entity6 currently has £ 14m of assets which are available for confiscation			1
the conman ’s defence team argue he should repay £ 8m , and assert that the @entity94 mansion should not be part of proceedings			0
