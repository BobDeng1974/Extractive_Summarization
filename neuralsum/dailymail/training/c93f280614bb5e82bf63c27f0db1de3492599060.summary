the @entity0 arrived in @entity1 battling jetlag and chasing a first win of the season			1
but that is n’t all , as they plan to make @entity1 their home for the remainder of the week			1
with a depleted linebacking corps and a worrying inability to score touchdowns , @entity10 ’s side are certainly down , but not necessarily out			1
and as the bleary - eyed squad familiarise themselves with their sumptuous @entity15 surrounds , the @entity0 finished their first practice on @entity18 soil in high spirits ahead of their ‘ home ’ game with the @entity21 at @entity22 on sunday			1
@entity0 head coach @entity10 gave his players some time off to recover from the jetlag a raiderette struts her stuff on @entity29 in central @entity30 this week ‘ i thought practice was pretty good , ’ said head coach @entity10			1
‘ obviously we got here monday morning and the guys had a little bit of time on monday and tuesday to catch up on a little bit of rest			1
now we ’ll get started with a normal game week preparation			2
' i think the further we go into the week , the more acclimated the guys will get to the time change and hopefully that wo n’t be any sort of factor come sunday			1
’ after arriving in these shores on monday morning , quarterback @entity45 spoke of the oddities of the international series			1
@entity0 players prepare for a drill during training in @entity15 on wednesday quarterback @entity45 is struggling to get his head around the time difference ‘ it ’s crazy			1
i texted my wife this morning and she was still on tuesday			0
i was texting her goodnight and she said “ good morning ”			0
at the same time , the first day i got here , i tried to fight sleep as long as i could			0
i think i slept for like 11 hours that first day because i was trying to get caught up to this time zone			0
' obviously , still feeling it a little bit today			0
as the days have gone , it ’s gotten progressively better			1
the faster i can get into the right time zone , which is here , the better it will feel			0
i ’m glad we came out as early as we did because it definitely makes a difference			0
’ devoid of two starters - wide receiver @entity72 and safety @entity73 suffered foot injuries during the agonising 16 - 9 defeat at @entity1 - the @entity0 know they need to win			1
@entity0 brought their cheerleaders with them to @entity30 ahead of their @entity22 clash ‘ that ’s all i care about , ’ said rookie quarterback @entity45			1
‘ i ’ve told you guys that i ’ll throw five touchdowns or five picks , i could care less			1
i just want to win			0
that ’s all this game is about			2
that ’s all that matters in the @entity88			2
‘ as we saw last week , we score a touchdown , it gets taken away			2
we ’re going in there , who knows what could have happened after that			0
it ’s just that much			2
you learn how hard it is to win in this league and you learn how hard it is to get that first one			0
@entity101 was presented with his own personalised @entity0 shirt by @entity103 ' that ’s what i ’m learning right now , how much it really takes to get one win , let alone 16 , something that @entity1 has done before			1
hopefully we ’ll get it this week			0
i do n’t make any promises , i can tell you that			0
’ and @entity45 spoke in glowing terms of the explosive @entity115			2
‘ i can go on and on on their whole defense			2
they have so much talent			0
@entity115 is obviously a great player			0
you have to know … when you turn the film on , you ’re like “ oh my goodness , who is 91 ? ” it ’s one of those guys			2
you ’ve got to know where he ’s at at all times			2
’ @entity128 ( left ) is hoping for an improved performance against @entity21 at the weekend meanwhile @entity130 , the fifth overall pick of may ’s draft , was succinct about the @entity0 ’ fortunes so far			1
asked to summarise his tender three - game @entity88 career , he replied : ‘ got ta get better , got ta get better , got ta get better			1
’ like many , this is the linebacker ’s first trip to @entity1 , with the 22 - year - old replying : ‘ it ’s great			1
i ’m glad to be here and it ’s a different experience for me			2
i ’m glad to be blessed to have this opportunity			0
’ @entity0 have been preparing for the showdown at @entity144 in @entity15 they face an inconsistent @entity21 side , who have a rookie offensive line and concerns about @entity149 at quarterback			1
but their defense is a force to be reckoned with , as @entity10 alluded to			1
‘ it ’s a good football team			1
defensively , they ’re fast			0
they do some different things			0
they like to pressure the quarterback			0
' they ’ve done a great job of getting pressure on the quarterback so we ’ve got to understand what they ’re trying to do			0
their front four is outstanding as far as getting pressure on the quarterback			0
we ’ve got to take care of the front four			0

the @entity0 are 0 - 3 and face the @entity21 at @entity22 on sunday
designated as the ‘ home ’ team @entity10 ’s side arrived in @entity1 on monday
