a report reveals anti-cholinergic drugs – used to treat asthma , high blood pressure , insomnia , dizziness and diarrhoea – even affect everyday activities such as eating and getting dressed			1
up to half of the @entity21 ’s elderly population are prescribed at least one medication with anti-cholinergic properties , which include antidepressants , antihistamines , sleeping pills and antipsychotics			1
the heart drug digoxin , the blood thinner warfarin and the painkiller codeine have a mild anti-cholinergic effect			1
those with more severe effects include the antidepressant @entity35 , a drug for an overactive bladder called oxybutynin and schizophrenia drug clozapine			2
others are sold over the counter , such as some hay fever and heartburn remedies			2
these medications affect the brain by blocking a key chemical messenger called acetylcholine , which has a range of functions			2
as a result the drugs may trigger side - effects including dizziness , sedation , confusion , delirium , constipation and blurred vision , which although uncomfortable for young users may aggravate existing health problems in the elderly			1
the research , by a number of centres including the @entity66 and the @entity67 in the @entity68 , will be published next month in @entity69 , a journal of the @entity71			2
it looked at 46 worldwide studies that included 60,944 patients who had taken anti-cholinergic medications for up to ten years			0
two - thirds of studies were carried out in care homes , the remainder in hospitals			0
a number of studies found the drugs were linked to a deterioration in physical function , while others showed a ‘ negative effect ’ on cognitive function			0
the higher the dose of anti-cholinergic medication , the lower the physical functioning , which could be a cause of falls			1
the drugs may trigger side - effects including dizziness , sedation , confusion , and blurred vision			0
file picture dr @entity99 , from @entity66 ’s @entity100 , said : ‘ this is the first research to show a significant decline in physical , as well as cognitive , function			1
‘ this means patients could become less and less able to carry out everyday activities like walking around , feeding themselves , washing and getting dressed			0
‘ this is likely due to the direct effect on cholinergic neurons compounded by an increase in the blood - brain permeability			0
‘ we have also seen the type of drug may be important , and more research needs to be done to ascertain which types are more dangerous than others			0
’ the researchers advise that rather than taking sleeping pills with anti-cholinergic properties , people could skip naps , limit evening exercise and remove distractions from the bedroom			1
meanwhile , hospitals and nursing homes could work to keep older folk awake and stimulated during the day , naturally encouraging sleepiness , they said .			0
