he flies the world in a blood - red private jet , has an access - all - areas @entity5 pass worth a cool £ 1 million and is fresh from the red carpet at the @entity9 awards , resplendent in a solid gold chain worthy of a superstar rapper			1
and like most a-listers , this particular star is not without a few unpleasant habits			0
support staff at the @entity9 awards can attest as much , having been tasked with picking up after him			0
welcome to the world of @entity18 , a two - year - old bulldog who lives a life of absurd luxury			1
home is a £ 10 million apartment in @entity37 , which he shares with @entity27 , his girlfriend @entity39 and a bulldog bitch called @entity29			1
yet there is no question who rules the roost			2
since padding into @entity27 ’s life in february 2013 , @entity24 has taken centre stage			1
take the family ’s sleeping arrangements			0
@entity27 may be dating one of the most desired women on the planet in @entity39 , but when the day ends , it is @entity24 who snuggles between the @entity55 cotton sheets alongside his master			1
( ms @entity39 is based for much of the year in @entity57			2
) and as the racing driver jets between the @entity57 and @entity59 in that gleaming £ 20 million @entity60 , he does so with @entity24 sitting beside him on his personal cream leather seat			1
double act : the pair together at last night 's @entity9 awards indeed , @entity24 has his own passport as well as that pass to the @entity5 paddock , which was given to him by @entity68 , the billionaire overlord of the sport			1
sponsors pay upwards of £ 1 million for these passes , yet @entity24 ’s , which features a photograph of the bulldog in a pair of expensive @entity77 headphones , was a gift			1
while many people were nonplussed to see a celebrity turning up to the televised awards with his pet , to those who know @entity27 well it was no surprise to see the pooch waddling along the red carpet on sunday night , complete with gold chain			1
@entity27 was wearing this jewellery at some of his public appearances towards the end of the @entity5 season , and is happy to share his substantial worldly goods with his dog			1
this is a fastidious professional who obsesses over the tiniest detail to give him a racing advantage			2
yet he allows @entity24 to play with his race helmet as if it was a toy ball			1
and this is no ordinary piece of kit			0
it takes three days to make one and they cost £ 3,300 apiece			2
that said , they are designed to withstand 800c flames and huge impacts , so an encounter with an enthusiastic bulldog is unlikely to cause too much of a problem			2
the helmet is adorned with an image of @entity27 with @entity39 and — you guessed it — @entity114			2
the extent of the driver ’s canine infatuation has ruffled feathers , however , with questions raised about whether it is appropriate to allow a dog into the racing paddock			1
legendary commentator @entity123 did not mince his words : ‘ i have the utmost respect and admiration for @entity27 , but the @entity5 paddock is no place for a dog			1
think of the safety reasons			0
think , too , of how a dog ’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human ’s — and my hearing has been destroyed by @entity5 cars			0
i am utterly amazed he ’s allowed to take the dog in			0
i ca n’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about			0
’ all of which presented a dilemma for @entity27 ’s racing team , @entity143			1
by that point , @entity24 had his own bespoke canine racing suit , while @entity27 spent £ 220,000 on hiring a luxury motor home for the @entity59 season — because the hotels frequented by the @entity5 hierarchy do not allow dogs			1
some race tracks , seduced by the glamour of the driver and his designer dog , use them as an advertising tool			0
for the @entity158 , the organisers provided @entity24 with a bespoke timber kennel , with his name over the door and a personalised cap			2
@entity24 , however , does not sleep in a kennel			2
and when his master is otherwise disposed , only the very best treatment will do			0
the x factor : a friendly nuzzle for @entity27 's girlfriend @entity39			1
the singer spends half the year in @entity57 - leaving a space in the couple 's bed for @entity114 to slip between the @entity55 cotton sheets high flyers : @entity175 - bound with @entity24 ( left ) , @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity27 on board a private jet @entity180 - @entity179 , senior ‘ host ’ at @entity184 in @entity185 — the carmaker ’s flagship centre — was left in no doubt about this earlier this year			1
accustomed to dealing with the biggest star names , she was taken aback by what happened when the driver arrived to film a commercial			0
with @entity27 fed , watered , made up and safely installed on set , she was settling down for a cup of coffee when the phone rang			2
‘ it was our reception desk advising me that two of his guests had arrived on site , ’ she says			0
‘ most of the entourage were here by then , so i thought : “ who could it be ? ” what 's up , dawg : in beats headphones			0
the two - year - old bulldog even has his own pass to the @entity5 paddock ‘ i went to introduce myself and i ’m faced with two little bulldogs			1
panic inside , we do n’t allow dogs in the building , what am i going to do ? i need to move them pretty quickly			0
‘ i make it to the suite , get them set up very quickly			0
they need water , they need food , they need cushions			0
they had to be taken for various things such as comfort breaks			0
we even had to call the cleaning team for help at one point , because i do n’t deal with things like that			0
i started the day expecting one celebrity			0
i finished it with three			0
‘ i hope i made them happy , and by the snores coming out of @entity114 i think they all had a good time			0
’ since arriving in @entity27 ’s life , @entity24 has become a social media star			1
there is footage of him in @entity27 ’s bed , on aircraft and even on a trip to a bowling alley			2
@entity27 , who does n’t have children , is fond of dressing up his beloved dog in designer hats , headphones and jewellery			2
he also brings along @entity114 to interviews ( on one occasion having to apologise when the mutt ’s loud snoring drowned out his answers )			0
yet it ’s plain @entity24 has fulfilled an important role in his master ’s life			1
raised in the rarefied atmosphere of motor racing , anointed as the chosen one since his teens , it is hardly surprising @entity27 is not the most worldly of individuals			1
@entity271 — or cursed — with a prickliness particular to the uber - competitive , he clearly takes great comfort from the unquestioning adoration of his dogs			0
@entity24 was joined last year by the bulldog bitch @entity29 , yet she has been comparatively anonymous , due in part to health problems			1
she has had to undergo two tricky operations to treat a problem with her tongue , so by and large @entity24 has travelled with @entity27 while she stayed at home			1
@entity27 grew up with pet labradors , though , so why a bulldog ? the answer may lie in his controversial relationship with his nationality			1
playtime : making friends with @entity27 's nephew , @entity289 , when @entity27 spent a day with his mother and sister @entity24 has his own passport and for the @entity158 , the organisers provided @entity24 with a bespoke timber kennel , with his name over the door and a personalised cap in his acceptance speech after winning @entity9 on sunday night , much was made of his pride in his @entity175 heritage			1
yet this is a man who , the moment the big bucks started rolling in , decamped to @entity305 and then @entity37 as a tax exile			2
@entity307 immediately lit up with outraged comments about the @entity9 ’s sporting champion not even paying a licence fee			0
he may believe that by having a @entity175 bulldog by his side , the public will subconsciously associate him with all things patriotic			0
but perhaps not when the dog is @entity317 , surely the most pampered ‘ non-dom ’ in the canine world			2
chilling out : the intrepid trio take to the slopes			0
@entity24 was joined last year by the bulldog bitch @entity29 , yet she has been comparatively anonymous , due in part to health problems			1

@entity317 , a two - year - old bulldog , padded into @entity27 's life in 2013
since then he has ruled the roost at @entity27 's £ *10m* apartment in @entity37
he has his own passport and even owns a pass to the @entity335 1 paddock
while racing driver jets between country 's , @entity24 has his own seat on jet
