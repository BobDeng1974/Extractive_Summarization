@entity0 , a professor in climate systems at @entity2 , said the storms have been driven by the jet stream one of the @entity6 ’s most senior experts yesterday made a dramatic intervention in the climate change debate by insisting there is no link between the storms that have battered @entity11 and global warming			1
@entity0 , a professor in climate systems at @entity2 , said the storms have been driven by the jet stream – the high - speed current of air that girdles the globe – which has been ‘ stuck ’ further south than usual			1
professor @entity0 told @entity17 : ‘ there is no evidence that global warming can cause the jet stream to get stuck in the way it has this winter			1
if this is due to climate change , it is outside our knowledge			0
’ his statement carries particular significance because he is an internationally acknowledged expert on climate computer models and forecasts , and his university post is jointly funded by the @entity6			1
prof @entity0 is also a senior adviser – a ‘ co-ordinating lead author ’ – for the @entity34 @entity33 ( @entity33 )			2
his statement appears to contradict @entity6 chief scientist dame @entity35			1
last weekend , she said ‘ all the evidence suggests that climate change has a role to play ’ in the storms			2
prof @entity0 made clear that he believes it is likely global warming could lead to higher rainfall totals , because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water			1
but he said this has nothing to do with the storm conveyor belt			0
he said that when the @entity33 was compiling its @entity49 on climate change last year , it discussed whether warming might affect the jet stream			1
but , he went on , ‘ there was very low confidence that climate change has any effect on the jet stream getting stuck ’			1
in the end , the possibility was not even mentioned in the report			0
prof @entity0 declined to comment on his difference of opinion with @entity62			2
five months ago , in a briefing on the @entity33 report to ministers , @entity62 conceded the consequence of warming for rainfall ‘ is not simulated well ’ by climate models – though they are the basis for most of what she and other scientists say about the effects of climate change			2
last april , after the temperature fell to -11c in @entity78 , the coldest april temperature for more than 100 years , @entity62 said the cold winter and spring might also be due to global warming , because of ice melting in the @entity83			1
professor @entity0 ' statement appears to contradict @entity6 chief scientist dame @entity35 meanwhile , the @entity6 has continued to issue questionable long - term forecasts			1
in mid-november , two weeks before the first of the storms , it predicted persistent high pressure for the winter , which was ‘ likely to lead to drier - than - normal conditions across the country ’			2
it added that its models showed the probability of the winter being in the driest of five official categories was 25 per cent			0
the chances of it being in the wettest category was 15 per cent			0
infamously , in april 2009 , the @entity6 promised a ‘ barbecue summer ’ – which then turned out to be a washout			0
it forecast the winter of 2010 to 2011 would be mild : it was the coldest for 120 years			0
in 2007 , the @entity6 said that globally , the decade 2004 - 2014 would see warming of @entity105			2
in fact , the world has not got any warmer at all in this period			0
at the beginning of 13 of the past 14 years , the @entity6 has predicted the following 12 months would be significantly warmer than they have been			0
this , says the sceptic think - tank the @entity114 , indicates ‘ systemic ’ bias			0
firing line : a storm passes over @entity11 on the ' conveyor belt ' last week			0

@entity0 , @entity120 in climate systems , said storms driven by jet stream that has been ' stuck ' further south than usual
he told @entity17 there is ' no evidence that global warming can cause the jet stream to get stuck in the way it has this winter '
