by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 5 september 2013 as @entity2 recuperated from her kidney transplant , @entity1 did all he could to keep her cheerful			1
he held her hand and massaged her feet			0
he propped her up as she limped to the hospital toilet			0
he bought her new pyjamas and sneaked in her favourite chocolate			0
to those around them , @entity1 looked like a devoted partner , well versed in the idiosyncrasies that made his relationship work			1
but the reality was somewhat more complicated			0
@entity1 's role was not limited to that of self - appointed carer			1
he was also @entity2 's kidney donor			1
and the two were n't lovers , but survivors of a chequered romantic history for which @entity1 was desperate to make amends			1
back together : @entity2 and @entity1 today after her once ailing health reunited them twenty years earlier they had fallen in love and had a child together			1
but @entity1 , by his own admission , had not been a good boyfriend or father and they separated when their son , @entity36 , was just three months old			1
they drifted further apart until @entity1 discovered the extent of his ex-girlfriend 's ailing health			1
@entity2 was suffering from kidney failure and in urgent need of a transplant			1
@entity1 - overcome with remorse for the way their relationship had ended - offered to help			1
his altruism not only saved @entity2 's life , but prompted an extraordinary romantic reunion			1
' @entity1 risked his life for me , reminding me why i loved him , ' says @entity2 , 44			1
@entity1 , 54 , hopes he can atone for past mistakes : ' i was so worried about @entity54 and could n't stand the thought of our son growing up without his mother			1
' as they were : the couple in 1994 when their son , @entity36 , was born			0
they separated months later theirs is an incredible love story , as complex as it is heart - warming			2
the two met in @entity68 , in the summer of 1992 when @entity1 was working in a local pub that @entity2 , then 23 , frequented			1
their friendship blossomed into romance , with @entity1 proclaiming her ' the most beautiful girl i 'd ever met '			2
she also had a dramatic medical history			0
at the age of 17 , after years of health complications , she was diagnosed with kidney failure			1
@entity2 's sister , @entity78 , two years her senior , had donated her kidney and the transplant operation , in 1988 , was a success			1
@entity2 , a pharmaceutical assistant manager from @entity83 , says : ' i was young and thought i was invicible '			2
' @entity1 asked if he could help			2
i said , without thinking , " you could give me a kidney " ' but she was told that the stress of her transplant would make falling pregnant impossible			2
so when the pair discovered she was expecting a baby in august 1993 , both were stunned			0
still , when their son @entity36 was born in february 1994 , they relished the prospect of parenthood			0
but they underestimated the toll it would take on their relationship			0
@entity1 was by now a pub manager , starting work at 7.30am and finishing after midnight			2
@entity1 , for his part , does not deny being an inadequate father			1
' i was n't prepared to prioritise family , ' he admits			0
after three months @entity2 told @entity1 she 'd had enough and moved out			1
@entity1 's visits to his son dwindled , and in 1996 he moved to @entity109 to manage a different pub and fell in love with a colleague			1
the following year , @entity2 also met a new partner			1
years went by with @entity1 's only contact being in the form of a child benefit cheque			1
then , in early 2003 , @entity2 's relationship broke down , coinciding with a sudden deterioration in her health			1
after coughing up blood one evening in november that year , she was admitted to @entity68 's @entity121			0
tests revealed her transplanted kidney was failing			0
grown up : @entity1 admitted he was n't prepared to prioritise family in his thirties she felt obliged to tell @entity1 , but with typical stoicism she downplayed the situation			1
the reality was somewhat different			0
' within weeks , i had to give up work , ' says @entity2			2
she was put on peritoneal dialysis - which meant her blood was cleaned through a tube in her stomach - for 90 minutes a day , and later that year moved , with @entity36 , to @entity83 where her sister , @entity78 , 46 , lived			0
it was 2006 before her condition stabilised sufficiently for her to be put on the transplant list			0
but there was a shortage of donors and @entity2 's prospects were bleak			2
the same year @entity1 's nine - year relationship ended ; ruined again by his workaholic tendencies			2
he moved back to @entity68 and became a courier , resuming contact with @entity2 and their son , then 13 , and visited them for the first time in a decade			1
it was a fraught meeting			0
' @entity36 did n't feel he needed him back and , while i no longer felt resentful , the conversation hardly flowed , ' @entity2 admits			1
nonetheless , the couple kept in telephone contact as @entity2 's health worsened			1
by 2007 , her weakening body was a battleground of scars from constant operations and dialysis			0
with no new kidney , her life expectancy was estimated at just two years			2
' when i was alone i would weep , ' she says			0
yet she did n't tell @entity1 how she felt : ' i did nâ€™t want to worry him or warrant his pity			2
' but in may 2009 , @entity1 finally broke through her controlled demeanour			2
' he asked how i was and something inside me snapped , ' says @entity2			2
' i was tired of putting on a front and broke down			0
' @entity1 asked if he could help			2
i said , without thinking , " you could give me a kidney			0
" @entity1 replied " ok , i will			2
" i was stunned but did n't believe he meant it			0
' after @entity1 convinced @entity2 he was serious , the couple had tests for compatibility and counselling			1
' we were told i could feel forever indebted or blame @entity1 if the transplant failed , ' @entity2 says			1
' or he might feel resentful that he 'd lost a kidney for nothing			0
' the grim truth was that the transplant was more likely to fail than succeed ; because @entity1 was n't a perfect blood match there was a 60 per cent chance @entity2 's body would reject his kidney			1
the transplant was booked for november 30 , 2009 , at @entity187 - a day neither of them will ever forget			0
' @entity1 has not only saved my life - he has made me love living it again ' ' i tried not to show my nerves , ' remembers @entity1			1
' there were risks for me too , but there was no way i would back out			0
' @entity2 also struggled to control her emotions : ' i was overwhelmed with guilt , terrified something would go wrong			2
' @entity2 and @entity1 underwent a gruelling four - hour operation			1
when she came round , @entity1 , still groggy from his own procedure , was wheeled in to see her			2
' the operation was a success , ' he says			0
' now i was determined to do everything i could to help her recover			0
' as the days passed , nobody failed to notice the intimacy between the two - except the couple themselves			0
' i dismissed nurses ' suggestions that @entity1 still had feelings for me , ' says @entity2			1
' besides , i felt so weak romance was the last thing on my mind			0
' after they were discharged the following week , @entity1 stayed with @entity2 to attend hospital appointments			1
' he cooked and helped round the house , ' says @entity2			2
' i could n't have coped without him			0
' in love again : the couple 's romance is as complex as it is heart - warming yet it was n't until @entity1 arrived back in @entity68 a month after the operation that he realised his feelings extended beyond friendship			1
' i called @entity2 to say i was home and as i heard her voice it dawned on me that i was in love			1
' but he was reluctant to tell her how he felt			0
' she needed to focus on recovering , ' he explains			0
it was 18 months before they met again			0
by august 2011 , @entity2 paid @entity1 a visit			1
' he picked me up and gave me a huge hug , and something clicked , ' she says			0
that evening , as they sat on @entity1 's sofa , he kissed her on the lips			2
' as he pulled away he murmured " i 've always loved you " , ' she remembers			0
' i told him i loved him too			0
' they knew their future belonged together			0
@entity2 admits there has been some tension between her son , now 19 and a student , and his father			1
' but he 's pleased that i am happy and they 're growing closer			0
' the couple - who split their time between @entity68 and @entity83 - are now deciding which city to move to together			0
they insist none of the issues the transplant counsellor warned them about have materialised			0
' i did n't offer my kidney to get back with @entity54 , and she has n't got back with me because she feels the need to repay me , ' says @entity1			1
@entity2 will be on medication for ever			2
but she is buoyed by @entity1 's support			0
' @entity1 has not only saved my life - he has made me love living it again			1
