a family who saved vouchers so they could go on a £ 10 holiday have been hit with a £ 350 fine for taking their children out of school			1
@entity6 and @entity7 could not afford an expensive break with their four children - three of whom are school - age - so collected vouchers in a national newspaper to save money			1
but they returned from the five - day trip to @entity17 , @entity18 to discover they had been fined £ 369 for taking @entity20 , 9 , @entity21 , 6 , and @entity22 , 7 , out of school			1
the @entity7 family from @entity26 , @entity24 saved vouchers for a £ 10 holiday - but were hit with a £ 369 fine for taking their children out of school mrs @entity7 , 35 , said they took the risk of going on the trip during term time as they believed the maximum fine they would receive would be £ 60 and a similar trip during holidays would have cost in excess of £ 400			1
but instead both parents have been charged for each of their three children that all attend @entity46 in @entity26 , @entity24			2
the costly break has left mrs @entity7 - who also took her two - year - old son @entity48 with her - upset and angry			2
she said : ' i think it is appalling			0
the school has got it so wrong			0
we are both working parents and we do n't get much family time and we simply ca n't afford to go away during the school holidays			1
' if we had known it was going to cost us this much , we would never have gone			0
' the family have been told the fine must be paid within 28 days or it will be doubled			0
if that is not paid they could face a fine up to £ 2,500 and three months in prison			2
mrs @entity7 , from @entity26 , said : ' i am concerned that we wo n't be able to pay the fine and worried that any court action could jeopardise my husband 's job as an electrician visiting local schools			1
' she said she did write to the school to make the request to take the time off but @entity72 say it stands by its decision and claims its procedures were followed correctly			0
its policy states that leaves of absence during term time can only be granted by the head teacher and is only allowed in exceptional circumstances - which do not include trying to avoid expensive holidays			0
a spokesman said : ' if the school refuses your request and the child is taken out of school , this will be recorded as an unauthorised absence and this may make you liable to a penalty notice for each child , payable by each parent or carer			0
' the school have yet to comment on the row			0
the family took a five - day trip to @entity17 , @entity18 - but returned home to a shocking bill from the school			1

@entity24 family could n't afford full - price *getaway* in the school holidays
they collected newspaper vouchers to save money with £ 10 break
but five - day trip *landed* them with a £ 369 fine from *education* *authorities*
mother says : ' if we **'d** known it **'d** cost us so much , we would n't have gone '
they now fear they may face court action , which would hit father 's job
local *council* which runs the school has refused to back down over row
