@entity0 certainly lived up to its name as the final three games of the @entity3 served up a veritable try-fest in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity9 and @entity10 ’s efforts proved in vain as @entity12 claimed their second title in succession thanks to their 30 - point drubbing of @entity16 in @entity17			1
following a frantic finale , @entity19 ’s @entity18 points out six things we learned from this year ’s championship			1
@entity12 's players celebrate with the @entity3 trophy at @entity17 after being crowned champions attitude is everything after four rounds of claustrophobic , defence - orientated rugby – the floodgates opened up on the final day of the 2015 @entity3			1
plenty has been said in recent weeks about the state of the modern game			2
kick - chasing , rush defences and negative tactics have led to some turgid contests in this season ’s tournament			2
tries and big points totals were the order of the day on saturday , however , and what a difference it made to all three contests as @entity9 , @entity12 and @entity10 threw everything into their late title bids			1
running rugby , offloads and daring play were on display across @entity53 as @entity12 did enough to claim the trophy			1
the game does n’t need to change ; it ’s just a question of mindset			2
@entity57 goes over the line to give @entity10 an early lead in their @entity3 clash with @entity61 @entity10 have the firepower to match anyone on their day @entity10 relied on their forward power to dig themselves out of a hole against @entity9 in the opening round , but it was the backs who rescued the contest against @entity61 … and almost secured the championship			1
in a frantic game of rugby played at breakneck speed - the likes of @entity57 , @entity73 and @entity74 tore the @entity79 defence to shreds			2
@entity81 , aged just 22 , looks the real deal at fly half and is developing a world class half back pairing with @entity57			0
all @entity86 needs now is a foil at inside centre to add width and a kicking option to @entity10 ’s attack			1
@entity93 playmaker @entity92 could very well be the answer to that conundrum			0
@entity97 ’s side are by no means the finished article but if they can fuse their monstrous pack , efficient set - piece and exciting wide men together , they could be serious contenders for the @entity104 trophy			0
@entity10 's @entity74 dives over the line to score @entity97 's side 's second try @entity61 remain an enigma locked in a riddle @entity110 has overseen another disappointing tournament for @entity61 , but his side showed at @entity113 that they can certainly play when the mood takes them			1
following four rounds of stuttering attacking play , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 ran amok at @entity113			0
sweeping backline moves , offloads and counter-attacking ballast ; where was this @entity79 team hiding ? a special mention for monstrous loosehead prop @entity126 who tracked @entity120 ’s weaving run to touch down in the left corner			0
it summed up @entity61 ’s attitude on the day			1
interestingly , @entity61 arrived in @entity7 boasting the meanest defence in the tournament only to then leak a flurry of tries			1
@entity61 remain an enigma , but one thing is certain , @entity110 has plenty of work to do if his side are to make any impression when they return to @entity10 for the big one in september			1
@entity120 touches down for @entity61 at @entity113 to score a controversial try the @entity142 will be hard to stop @entity12 bounced back from their setback against @entity9 with a powerful performance against the @entity145			1
@entity147 ’s side went back to basics with their intelligent kicking game complemented by a strong set - piece and canny power plays			0
but @entity12 also showed thay can attack with ball in hand and expanded their game to allow the attacking talents of @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 to flourish in the wide open spaces of @entity17			2
@entity12 will have their detractors but back - to - back @entity3 titles speak for themselves			1
if @entity147 ’s side can add some extra guile to their attacking game in the coming months , they will be serious contenders for the forthcoming @entity167			0
@entity158 ( left ) celebrates scoring his try with @entity159 and fly half @entity169 ( right ) no 3 is the no 1 issue for @entity9 @entity9 finished the tournament like a runaway train but @entity173 will have nightmares about the mincing his side ’s scrum took against @entity12 and @entity177			2
the @entity178 have some of the most devastating strike runners in the game in the form of @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 while @entity185 had one of his best tournaments to date			0
having all that talent out wide counts for nothing , however , if a solid platform is missing			0
@entity192 ’s long - term injury at tighthead has created a huge void for @entity173			0
veteran @entity195 insists his test days are over but , if @entity173 wants @entity9 to mount a serious challenge at the @entity167 , he may have to swallow his pride and give @entity199 a call			0
@entity192 's absence through injury has left a huge void in the @entity9 side @entity5 has fallen saturday ’s contest in @entity5 served up yet another final day capitulation from the @entity177			2
this is becoming quite the habit for the tournament whipping boys			0
wales were impressive but some of the @entity214 defence was laughable at times			0
there is no question that @entity177 ’s presence has benefited the tournament greatly , but big improvements are needed going forward			0
@entity220 is unquestionably world class but the @entity222 has been carrying the burden of a nation for long enough			0
there are some grounds for optimism for @entity177 though with the likes of @entity229 and @entity230 showing glimpses of attacking potential throughout the tournament			0
@entity220 grimaces as he leaves the pitch during the @entity3 i match between @entity177 and @entity61			1

@entity12 were crowned @entity3 champions after beating @entity16
@entity10 beat @entity61 but failed to win by enough points to finish top
