the 36 - year - old former @entity9 all - rounder got a last - minute call up for the final after @entity13 damaged his shoulder in the semi and looked set to deliver a virtuoso performance when he dismissed his old mate @entity18 with the first ball of his spell			2
he returned , with hope apparently gone , to smash 20 not out off just eight balls , to give @entity4 a chance of the most unlikely victory only for current @entity9 all - rounder @entity25 to hold his nerve with a brilliant last over to leave @entity1 and his team - mates five runs short of victory			1
