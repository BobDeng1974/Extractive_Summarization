being made redundant makes people less willing to trust others for up to a decade afterwards , according to a study			1
losing a job in this way dents trust so badly that even finding new work fails to overcome the problem , the researchers found			1
it suggests that , even in later life , people can struggle to get over a firing in their life			0

' trauma like redundancy can shift people ’s outlook of the world , ' said dr @entity26 of the university study author dr @entity26 , from the @entity14 , said : ‘ people ’s willingness to trust others tends to remain largely stable over their lifetime			1
‘ however , this work shows that trauma like redundancy can shift people ’s outlook of the world and this change persists long after the experience occurred			1
‘ society is still recovering from one of the longest recessions this century and much has been discussed in counting the economic costs of that			0
‘ even a single experience of redundancy can lead to depressed trust and what is particularly concerning is that people reported less willingness to trust others even after they got another job			2
no matter how good your cv , it 's your voice that may actually help you land the job			0
researchers found recruiters rated candidates as more competent , thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it - even when the words used were exactly the same			0
they also discovered evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates ' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates ' own written pitches			0
the new study by @entity71 professor @entity70 and phd candidate @entity72 also found the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate 's voice			2
‘ this has important implications not just for the person involved but for society as a whole as trust can have significant benefits , from health and happiness , to social cohesion , efficient democratic governance and economic development			0
’ the study , which was published in the journal @entity91 , involved data from almost 7,000 @entity94 adults followed as part of the @entity96 of adults born in march 1958			0
responses from 1991 , when the individuals were 33 , were compared with responses from 2008 , when they were 50 , noting whether they had experienced involuntary job loss from redundancy , downsizing or restructuring in the period in between			2
their responses showed that at age 50 , those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off			1
among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work , the figure rose to seven per cent			0
to find out how long the effect of redundancy continues , the data was split into groups according to the age they were laid off : ages 33 - 41 ( but not 41 - 50 ) ; 41 - 50 ( but not 33 - 41 ) and both 33 - 41 and 41 - 50			2
their responses showed that at age 50 , those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off ( stock image shown )			1
among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work , the figure rose to seven per cent ‘ we observe that experiencing displacement within any age group has a significant negative effect on trust , ’ said dr @entity26			1
‘ importantly , individuals who experienced displacement between the ages of 33 - 41 but not 41 - 50 are therefore also likely to report lower trust at age 50			0
‘ this is suggestive that the effect of displacement can persist at least nine years after the event occurred			2
’ he added : ‘ the greater the attachment to employment , the stronger the negative effect of displacement			0
‘ a range of mediators , such as physical health , mental well - being , and personal efficacy , do not appear to account for the effect			0
‘ that the effect remains present at least nine years after the even occurred demonstrates the severity of displacement experiences			2
