wind farms have been paid £ 43million to stand idle so far this year , a new @entity2 record			1
the payments , funded through householders ’ electricity bills , were made to suppliers because the @entity7 was unable to use their electricity			1
the sums paid in ‘ constraint payments ’ to wind farms have risen rapidly in the past four years , according to electricity market data			1
wind farms have been paid £ 43million to stand idle after producing too much energy for the @entity7 the total with two months still to go has already far surpassed the £ 32million paid in the whole of 2013			1
payments totalled £ 6million in 2012 and £ 174,000 in 2010			1
high winds last month set new daily records for compensation - with £ 3.07million paid to 33 wind farms to switch off on a single day , october 26			1
@entity22 , of the @entity23 which campaigns against energy subsidies , said too many wind farms had been built too quickly , without the infrastructure to cope with the power			1
officials are also pandering to suppliers running the government ’s ‘ pet technology ’ , he said , allowing them to charge whatever they wanted to switch off			2
the wind industry claims the payments are justified because of the operational costs involved in switching off			2
they say other energy industries , such as coal plants , can far more easily stop production and save money when they do so			2
but critics point out that the high value of payments reflect a fundamental problem with wind power			2
@entity46 , energy secretary , said acting to scrap wind power was a ' dangerous ' idea wind turbines are inherently unpredictable , depending on the weather , and so must be controlled to stop surges causing physical damage to electricity cables and equipment			2
the windiest places are often the furthest away from cities where the power is needed , meaning high transmission costs			0
the overwhelming majority of the payments to date have been to wind farms in @entity64 , where the bulk of wind farms are located			1
electricity demand in @entity64 does not match the power produced on the windier days , but cable networks to take the power south into @entity70 have not yet been constructed			0
as a result @entity7 has to pay the wind farm owners to stop generating in order to keep supply and demand balanced			1
renewable @entity2 , which represents the wind industry , points out that wind power is reaching more homes than ever before – supplying a record 24 per cent of the nation ’s electricity on one particularly windy day last month			2
@entity81 , its director of external affairs , said last in october : ‘ wind power is often used as a convenient whipping boy by political opponents and vested interests			0
‘ all the while , it ’s been quietly powering millions of homes across the @entity2 and providing a robust response to its vocal detractors			0
’ but dr @entity22 said : ‘ managing wind power is a very expensive business			0
' we built too much , too quickly			2
it is unpredictable and because it tends to be sited in a location a long way from people , it costs a lot to transmit			0
‘ building more grid is given as the answer , but that is very expensive - it would have been cheaper not to build these wind farms in the first place			1
‘ they are charging very high prices to switch off - far higher than the cost of actually producing the power - but officials will not challenge them because this the government ’s pet technology			0
’ the cost of wind power has become an increasingly divisive issue at the heart of @entity114			0
@entity119 has pledged to place new limits on onshore wind farms if the @entity122 win a majority at the next election , a policy that has been bitterly opposed by @entity126			1
@entity127 , the @entity128 , last week said acting to scrap wind power was a dangerous and populist idea			0
speaking in the @entity131 , he attacked ‘ anti-renewables , anti-wind tendency ’ of his @entity135 colleagues			0
he said : ‘ it is imperative that these tendencies are resisted , particularly in the run - up to the general election			0
short - term populism is the most dangerous enemy energy and climate change policy has			0
’ defending the constraint payments yesterday , a spokesman for mr @entity127 ’s @entity144 said : ‘ @entity7 has been paying coal and gas generators – and others – to change their planned output well before wind farms joined the mix. ‘ in fact , the majority of compensation goes to fossil fuel generators rather than onshore wind farms			1
the impact on energy bills is negligible			0
’ energy regulator @entity158 told the @entity160 : ‘ @entity7 ’s costs for making these payments have increased as more renewable generators have connected to @entity2 ’s networks before investment programmes have been completed to build new capacity			1
‘ last year @entity158 approved a major eight - year network investment programme to address this through renewing and building new capacity			0
’ the wind industry said it receives a tiny proportion of the budget spent on balancing electricity demand			0
a spokesman for renewable @entity2 said last night : ‘ constraint payments are one of the tools @entity7 use to manage the supply and demand of electricity , with payments going to different types of generators , both renewables and fossil fuels			1
‘ last year wind received just 5 per cent of the total payments for balancing the grid , equating to 65p a year on the average household bill			2

millions given to wind farms in ' constraint payments ' for unused energy
last year energy suppliers were paid £ 32milion by the @entity7
in 2012 only £ 6million was paid out and £ 174,000 two years before that
experts warn too many wind farms have been built too quickly
