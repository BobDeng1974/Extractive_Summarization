by @entity0 @entity1 insists @entity2 have not practised penalties ahead of wednesday night 's return leg against @entity5			1
the @entity7 last - eight tie is finely poised at 1 - 1 after @entity8 cancelled out @entity10 's header at @entity11 last week			1
a repeat result at the @entity13 would see the tie head to penalties			1
but on the topic of spot - kicks , @entity1 , who was speaking at his pre-match press conference , claimed his side had not prepared for such a scenario			1
' it 's less about technique and more about courage			0
it 's all in the head , ' said @entity1			1
' i think @entity5 will be again waiting for us at the back			2
they will be waiting deep , deep in their own half , ' @entity1 said			2
' @entity58 teams defend and then wait for the quick break			0
@entity60 also has eight , nine players at the back			0
they are waiting for mistakes , set pieces and breaks			0
' that is why we have to be disciplined			0
we are playing at home and that is important and we know exactly what to do to attack well			0
' @entity1 was in no doubt that @entity72 , who is struggling with a foot injury , would line up for @entity5 on wednesday night			1
all smiles : @entity72 appeared in a relaxed mood as he joined his @entity5 team - mates on tuesday on the attack : @entity1 was complimentary of @entity72 describing him as one of the best player 's he 's seen @entity72 missed his side 's 4 - 0 win over @entity82 at the weekend after it emerged that he may have chipped a bone in his foot			1
but speaking about the @entity86 sriker , who trained with the @entity5 squad on tuesday morning , @entity1 said : ' @entity72 is going to play , 100 per cent			1
he is going to play , i bet you a big big glass of beer			0
' @entity1 described @entity72 as ' a big player , one of the best i have seen in my career			1
' the @entity2 boss brushed aside their first league defeat after 53 games on , saying he was not after records			1
but after the draw in @entity101 and another draw against @entity103 it is the first time since 2011 that @entity2 , who clinched the @entity37 title in record time last month , have gone three straight games without a win			2
defeat : @entity2 saw their 53 - game unbeaten run come to an end against @entity49 on saturday raring to go : @entity1 expects @entity5 to play on the break in wednesday 's clash ' i knew that we would lose eventually , ' said @entity1 , who had fielded a below - strength team against @entity49 to rest key players			1
' the team knows how important the @entity7 is			2
obviously we still have to play the last few @entity37 games but our targets are now different ones			0
' @entity2 will be without two key midfielders , with @entity8 suspended following his red card in the first leg and @entity125 injured , leaving @entity126 and possibly right back @entity39 to occupy those positions			2
' @entity39 can play everywhere			0
we are missing many players and he has shown that he can play that position			0
' we know what we have to do and we will apply it			0
it is little details that will decide the outcome			0
