by @entity0 sugary drinks should be labelled with health warnings to make them as socially unacceptable as cigarettes because of their contribution to @entity8 ’s obesity epidemic , says a leading public health doctor			2
professor @entity10 of the @entity11 caused controversy earlier this year by declaring ‘ sugar is the new tobacco ’ and claiming the food industry was focused on ‘ profit not health ’			1
now he is calling on the government to follow the example of @entity19 which is considering placing warning labels on all sweetened drinks about the links to obesity , diabetes and tooth decay			1
professor @entity10 warns the government 's current policies are doing nothing to quash obesity he said current policies are failing to reverse the obesity epidemic in which sugar is ‘ increasingly implicated as a specific causal factor ’			1
and he highlighted a recent @entity35 study showing adults who drank more than one can of sugary fizzy drinks a day had a 22 per cent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who drank less than a can a month			0
in a personal view published on bmj.com ( must credit as stated ) , prof @entity10 said a third of children and two - thirds of adults are now overweight or obese in the @entity8			1
halving @entity48 and @entity8 children ’s sugar - sweetened beverage consumption could mean a 50 to 100 kcal reduction in energy intake a day , perhaps arresting or even reversing the current increases in obesity , he said			1
he said surveys showed 60 per cent of @entity8 would support warnings on food packaging , which may herald a ‘ tipping point in public attitudes and political feasibilities			0
’ the government ’s chief medical officer @entity59 warned in march that the government may soon have to slap a sugar tax on junk food and fizzy drinks to tackle obesity			2
professor @entity10 is part of a new @entity48 - @entity8 campaign group - action on @entity69 - that says asking firms to make voluntary changes has failed			1
he caused controversy in january by declaring : ‘ @entity69 is the new tobacco ’			0
the typical @entity74 consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46			0
the maximum intake recommended by the @entity78 is ten , although this guideline is likely to be halved			0
health officials in @entity19 are considering warning labels for soft drinks like those on cigarette packets prof @entity10 sugar was being ‘ progressively demonised ’			1
‘ many other potentially harmful products already carry effective health warnings			0
for example , insecticides and other toxic products have long carried labels warning users to take extreme care ’ he said			2
‘ similarly , cigarettes have gone from being socially acceptable to quite unacceptable after warning labels were implemented			1
‘ the effectiveness of tobacco warnings and plain packaging is now accepted by almost everyone not linked to the industry ’ he said			0
prof @entity10 said warning labels represented an ‘ interesting natural experiment ’ that ‘ may offer an effective new strategy to complement existing , potentially powerful interventions like marketing bans and sugary drinks duties ’			1
prof @entity107 , professor of @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , said there was mounting evidence for sugary drinks contributing to excess energy intake , obesity and , in turn , higher diabetes risks			2
‘ furthermore , as prof @entity10 points out , public support for an obesity warning on these drinks appears strong ’ he added			1
dr @entity121 , @entity122 and public health physician at @entity124 , @entity125 , said ‘ @entity127 problems need bold solutions			0
if the @entity129 , currently being considered for health warning labels on sugary drinks , goes ahead , it will set an important precedent			1
‘ there is a consistent body of evidence for the adverse health effects of sugary drinks			0
’ however , professor @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , said ‘ excessive intake of sugary drinks contributes to unhealthy weight gain in children			2
‘ but sugar is not like tobacco : it is not addictive and does not cause cardiovascular disease and cancer			0
‘ oral rehydration solutions , which contain sugar , have prevented millions of deaths			0
‘ the risks to young people ’s health presented by smoking , alcohol , drugs , unsafe sex , tattooing and body piercing are far greater – a warning label on soft drinks suggests a lack of perspective			2
’ @entity19 is considering a law that would require all cans and bottles of sugary beverages to have this warning label : ' drinking beverages with added sugars contributes to obesity , diabetes and tooth decay			1
' it could be voted on by the state senate next week .			0
