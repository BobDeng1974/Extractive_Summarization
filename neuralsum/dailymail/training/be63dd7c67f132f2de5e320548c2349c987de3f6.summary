he slammed on the brakes but could not avoid a collision			0
miss @entity16 ’s car was shunted into the opposite carriageway and when off - duty nurse @entity32 went to help the occupants @entity26 said to her : ' i ’m so sorry			1
what have i done ? ' when interviewed , she said she had waited for one car to pass , seen mr @entity20 ’s car approaching about 200 metres away and thought she had enough time to cross to the central reservation			2

a statement read to the court in @entity54 said : ' @entity2 enjoyed good health			2

' no further documents will be issued on such vehicles until a vehicle identity check has been conducted to confirm the identity of the vehicle and have a current @entity114 if required			0
' ' there was a severe broadside impact to the offside of the vehicle , ' he said			0
' the consequence of a previous sub-standard repair undoubtedly caused greater intrusion of the side panel			0

' there is an increased likelihood of the occupants sustaining greater injury , although i do not know by how much			0
