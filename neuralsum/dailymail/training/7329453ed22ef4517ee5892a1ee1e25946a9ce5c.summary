people living in the port city where a @entity3 ship is docked ahead of its mission to destroy @entity6 chemical weapons say they are worried about potentially dangerous leaks			1
residents of the town next to the southern @entity11 port of @entity12 say they have been kept in the dark about the chemical weapons being shipped in			1
despite official reassurances , they fear the potential impact that any leaks may have on their health or the environment and accuse the government of lumbering them with the consignment			2
mayor of @entity23 : he said local people had been kept in the dark over the hundreds of tons of chemical weapons being transported to their city from @entity6 to be decomissioned the @entity29 arrived in @entity12 today for the unprecedented transfer and destruction of about 1,300 tons of @entity6 chemical weapons			1
the 648ft @entity3 government cargo ship has been fitted with two machines designed to neutralize the most toxic chemicals , including mustard gas and the raw materials for sarin nerve gas			2
the chemicals were handed over by the @entity6 government as part of a deal with the international community to destroy its chemical weapons			2
the most dangerous chemical weapons will be transferred from the @entity48 vessel @entity49 to the @entity29 , which will move into international waters for the destruction			0
other material will be taken to toxic wastes sites in various countries for disposal			0
kept in the dark : people sunbathe on the beach of @entity23 , next to the giant @entity12 port but on the eve of the ship 's arrival , residents and officials from @entity12 and nearby towns voiced concern about potential environmental contamination as a result of the transfer			1
they also complained that they had n't been told what exactly would be taking place near their homes			0
' we live this situation with uncertainty and resignation because for the last four months we continued to ask for information about it but they did n't give it , ' said @entity81 , mayor of the nearby town of @entity23			1
he told @entity11 paper @entity83 : ' people are fed up and it ’s not true that they support it			1
' we ’re not even sure about the materials being transported … some people speak about the lethal impact of @entity90 [ mustard gas ] and sarin , others are even claiming that the entire load of weapons is ready for use			2
' he accused the @entity11 government of ' making it rain on the heads ' of people on @entity101 , which is one of the country 's poorest regions			1
@entity105 patrol the port 's perimeter : locals fear the potential impact that any leaks may have on their health or the environment and accuse the government of lumbering them with the consignment while the disarmament process is risky from beginning to end , those in charge have insisted that equally hazardous chemicals are neutralised on a daily basis around the world			2
but the claims are scant reassurance to residents aware that @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 had all refused to host the stockpile before their own government accepted it			1
destroying chemical weapons at sea is unprecedented , but @entity3 officials told the @entity133 that the process is a proven , safe way to neutralise toxic chemicals			0
