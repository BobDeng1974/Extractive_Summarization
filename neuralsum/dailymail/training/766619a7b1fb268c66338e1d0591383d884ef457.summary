by @entity0 published : 12:35 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 14:13 est , 6 december 2012 a widow who found an old coin as she cleared out her late husband ’s chest of drawers today sold it for nearly £ 300,000 at auction			1
the unidentified woman had no idea her husband had the valuable treasure stashed away among his clothes			1
it was only when an expert inspected it that it was revealed to be a ‘ lost ’ coin made from gold seized by the @entity18 from a @entity20 treasure ship in 1702			1
lying in a drawer for years : the ' @entity23 ' gold coins were only bought by ' seriously wealthy ' people in 1703 the unnamed pensioner , from @entity26 , was told the coin had an estimated value of up to £ 120,000 , but today it was auctioned for more than double that following a tense stand - off between two telephone bidders			1
the coin is extremely rare as only 20 were made from 7.5lbs of gold seized from @entity20 treasure ships by the @entity18 in @entity23 , northern @entity20 , in 1702			1
even in 1703 , when they were made by the @entity37 , they would have been extremely expensive and bought only by the rich			1
the whereabouts of fewer than 15 of the coins are currently known about , and they are in private hands			1
the coin that was sold today is thought to have been inherited , rather than bought , by the woman 's late husband , as he showed no interest in coin - collecting when he was alive			1
@entity47 , of auctioneers @entity48 , said : ' a client of ours asked to bring in some coins that she had found at home			2
' i was n’t really excited at the time because most coins we came across are worth very little			2
@entity58 - side : the five - guinea piece bears the date 1703 and four shields with the arms of @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 on one side			1
on the other side is the bust of @entity69 ' she produced from her handbag one or two old silver coins worth a few pounds			1
i flippantly said " it 's a pity you have n’t got any gold ones " and she said that she had			0
' with that she produced this 1703 five guinea piece			1
she said she had found it in her late husband ’s chest of drawers and he died some years ago			2
' she knew nothing about it at all and neither did her grown - up children			0
i thought that it must have been a fake			0
she left it with me to do some more research on			0
' i sought a second opinion which confirmed it was genuine and i went and saw her to give her the good news			0
' she was very cool over it			0
' her husband was a professional man and beyond that we have no idea how he came by it			2
he must have inherited it			0
' the series of ' @entity23 ' coins were made out of treasure captured by the @entity18 fleet after they failed to take @entity102 in 1702 but managed to seize gold and silver from @entity106 - @entity20 treasure ships coming back from @entity107			1
the coins were made as part of an attempt to detract attention from the @entity18 failure at @entity102 , highlighting instead the haul of treasure they seized on their way home			1
mr @entity47 said : ' the treasure was received at the @entity37 by the master of the mint , sir @entity120			0
' it was decided that the treasure had to be coined as part of a propaganda opportunity			0
' about 20 of the @entity126 five guinea coins were struck and they would have been bought by seriously wealthy people at the time and kept as part of the family treasure			1
' this coin is in an extremely fine condition			2
it is very rare and is one of the most desirable gold coins around			2
' the coin sold at @entity138 in @entity26 for a hammer price of £ 240,000 , and with buyer ’s premium and @entity142 added on , the total amount was £ 296,160			2
a set of four 14th century paintings which have hung on the wall of a village church for 150 years have fetched almost £ 1million at auction			0
the paintings depicting @entity150 were found to be by @entity152 artists @entity153 after cleaning work was carried out on them in the 1990s			0
they had previously been hung at @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 , after they were donated by @entity161 in the 1840s			0
after their true value was discovered it was decided not to return them to the church due to security issues and conditions so the artworks - dating back to about 1390 - were transferred on loan to @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity174			0
they were sold yesterday at @entity176 in @entity177 for £ 950,000			0
valuable : two of the paintings which fetched almost £ 1million at auction			0

coin is one of just 20 @entity69 ' @entity23 ' five guinea pieces made in 1703
pensioner did *n't* know husband had it and says he had no interest in coins
