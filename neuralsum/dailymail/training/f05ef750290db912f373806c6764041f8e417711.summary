football fans tend to love one or the other			0
they constantly ask who is better ... ' @entity3 , his goalscoring record is unbeatable and his effortless demeanour is sumptuous to watch '			2
or : ' no , @entity6 , he works harder for the team , scores better goals and has shined in a less successful side over the past few years			0
' but on saturday evening , in the most important game of the season so far , for once eyes were n't solely cast on them			0
@entity3 ( right ) looks frustrated during the @entity16 match as @entity6 ( left ) lurks @entity6 looks frustrated after @entity17 go 1 - 0 down but the former @entity20 player soon got his goal @entity23 's return to football took most of the headlines pre-game , and @entity3 and @entity6 could shine when only half the attention was on them			1
in terms of direct impact on the game , in the first - half @entity6 scored from the spot and @entity3 missed from just seven yards with most of the goal to aim at - @entity17 had @entity33 to thank			1
otherwise , the @entity35 superstar was quiet			0
our expectations are sky high , but he was not hugely involved with the other goals in the 3 - 1 win at the @entity41			1
this was n't the ronaldo of the @entity45 final in 2014			0
3 - 1 up against @entity46 , @entity6 was desperate to star in @entity47 , and scored the penalty in extra-time before ripping off his shirt and producing every back page the next day			1
@entity3 's effort is brilliantly saved by @entity33 in the @entity17 net , with @entity54 1 - 0 up @entity54 held the lead until the 35th minute after @entity57 's early goal in the @entity16 tie against @entity17 on saturday night he was uncharacteristically unselfish			1
some passes went astray in the final third and @entity17 's other stars shone			1
three or four times he got himself in dangerous positions with the ball on the counter attack , passing without looking only to find a @entity54 man			0
on saturday night , it was the @entity17 show , not the @entity6 show			2
his performance looked a 7/10 at the very , very most			0
@entity6 takes his penalty in the 35th minute to bring @entity17 level in the @entity16 tie against @entity54 at the other end , as @entity54 chased the game , @entity3 tried his trademark runs with the ball several times , each time legally halted by the @entity17 defence			1
a passage of play on the right byline for @entity3 , summed up @entity3 's night			2
he twisted , turned and gained a couple yards on @entity83 beautifully , but his cross was deflected into the grateful hands of @entity33			0
for the @entity87 it was frustrating night , but his rival did n't steal the headlines either			2
@entity6 goes to his usual celebration after scoring against @entity54 to bring the teams level before half - time			1

all eyes were on @entity23 , but the world 's two best players *collided*
@entity6 was quieter than usual , despite scoring a penalty
he was unselfish , but often his passes went astray
@entity3 was kept out *wonderfully* by @entity17 's defence
the @entity87 did n't take any headlines , but nor did ronaldo
@entity107 and @entity108 also scored in @entity17 's 3 - 1 win
