if things do n’t go well for @entity2 at @entity3 and they lose this test match there can be no excuses			1
everything they asked for beforehand , they got			2
they got the pitch they craved and won the toss but they find themselves in the predicament they are in this morning because they bowled poorly on the first day and failed to take advantage of conditions which were stacked in their favour			2
some people have talked about the toss but @entity2 captain @entity23 had absolutely no choice but to bowl first on that			1
i do n’t care what anyone says			0
they just did n’t bowl well enough			2
sometimes you have to look at what went before you and the way the opposition had success and adapt accordingly			0
this just is n’t the pitch to ‘ guts it out ’ because there is always a ball with your name on it			2
look at the way @entity66 and @entity67 played with almost a one - day mindset			2
there was nothing reckless but they were positive and took the game to @entity2			1
on the other hand , @entity2 hit a wall when they got to 70 - odd for one			1
they just did n’t go anywhere and it concerns me that there is no - one in that top three who is going to take the initiative			1
@entity23 , @entity35 and @entity81 are similar players and nobody seems able to get busy and go after attacks			1
. rare celebration : @entity86 gets @entity87 's @entity67 out for 68 during the second test at @entity3 bad day : @entity89 sums up @entity2 's feelings on day four of the second test that ’s understandable for @entity23			1
he wanted to guts it out but i ’m afraid cricket is about scoring runs and not just occupying the crease			2
@entity99 used to say to me — when i was out of nick and would occasionally bend his ear — that it just takes a couple of boundaries to get yourself back in nick			0
@entity106 used to say the same			0
but even more important is the mindset			0
you ca n’t just look to leave , leave , leave			0
there were some good signs but because no - one is going at the other end there is no - one to relieve the pressure on @entity23			1
that allows @entity41 just to sit in with his seamers			0
high expectations : @entity2 failed to impress home crowd at a packed lord 's on day four of the second test there is no doubt there is still mental baggage from last winter in @entity125 for those senior players			1
this side , the senior guys , were used to winning and being national heroes			0
you have only to look at who is doing well in this side and it is the young players who have come in , such as @entity134 and @entity135			1
but there is no let - up in test cricket			0
they ca n’t go back to county cricket and score runs like players used to be able to			1
these players must fix this themselves			0
someone has to play that @entity67 role if @entity2 are going to have any chance whatsoever			2
whether it ’s @entity46 , @entity86 , @entity149 , whoever			0
someone has to take the attack to @entity87			0
otherwise there is only one outcome , i ’m afraid			0
nightmare spell : @entity43 leaves the field after being bowled out by @entity45 familiar sight : @entity87 celebrate the wicket of @entity2 's @entity35 @entity159 evenly poised - @entity31			1

if things do *n't* go to plan , there can be no excuses - @entity2 asked for this
@entity23 had no choice but to bowl first on the @entity168 's pitch
the home side hit a wall when they go to 70 - odd runs for one .
it is a concern that nobody in the top three seems to take initiative
there are no *leaders* to relieve the pressure on captain cook
mental baggage from ashes *whitewash* still weighing on players ' minds
