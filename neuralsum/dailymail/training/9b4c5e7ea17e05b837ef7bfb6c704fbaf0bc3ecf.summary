' i feel like i lost a part of my identity when i lost my hair			2
' the procedure was performed by @entity55 surgeon dr. @entity27			2
without the faces of @entity58 , the procedure would normally cost about $ 16,000			2
' we are trying to make these veterans look whole			0
there is a difference between healed and whole , ' dr. @entity61 , the humanitarian chair of the plastic surgery academy , told the @entity38			0

' the beard and facial hair will put him in harmony with how he feels			1
it ’s going to make a difference			0

the hair follicles on @entity0 ' face were deadened and his skin pigment damaged , though no one was seriously injured			1
' it was almost like a grease fire like you see in the kitchen , but it took off my eyebrows and eyelashes , ' eh said			0
' when i was receiving treatment , the doctors told me everything would grow back			0
i can grow a goatee , but only because it was covered during the blast by my chinstrap			0

at the end of the procedure , @entity0 said the resulting grafts looked like stubble from a five o'clock shadow , and were sensitive to touch			1
after two weeks those hairs will fall out , then four months later new hairs should regenerate			0
