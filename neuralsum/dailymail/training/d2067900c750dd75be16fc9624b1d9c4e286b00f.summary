by @entity0 @entity1 , 24 , has battled anorexia since she was eight an anorexic woman who has not eaten for a year could kill herself if the @entity5 stops treating her in hospital , her parents warned last night			1
@entity1 – who has a personality disorder and has tried to commit suicide nine times – was said to be making good progress until health bosses ruled they would not fund the £ 1,000 - a - day specialist care she needed			1
now the family of the 24 - year - old have released pictures of her plight in an attempt to save her life because they are so disgusted with the @entity5 ’s attitude			1
during her 16 - year battle with anorexia , miss @entity1 has swallowed razor blades , has been admitted to hospital ‘ hundreds of times ’ and has been repeatedly sectioned under the @entity25			1
her parents have been warned on several occasions to prepare for her death after her organs began shutting down			1
now doctors at the hospital in @entity31 where she has been treated for six months have decided to discharge her			2
as a result , she could be sent back into the community in days , weighing six stone and refusing all nutrients			2
miss @entity1 , who has only had a liquid diet for the past year , was to have been sent to the retreat clinic in @entity39 – one of the few units in the country that treats eating and personality disorders together			1
her consultant believed it could help her overcome anorexia and @entity47 was confident that it would save her life			0
but she was told three weeks ago that the @entity5 would not fund the £ 1,000 - a - day specialist care			1
she then left the hospital , went by rail to @entity53 and took an overdose of pills			0
her family used tracking software on her phone to find her and save her life			2
her parents have now set up an internet appeal to raise £ 1million for three years of treatment			1
she has not eaten food for over a year @entity1 three years ago before signs of her eating disorder			1
her mother says she also suffers from a personality disorder and has tried to commit suicide nine times they are furious with the @entity75 for its failure to help her effectively , even though her father , @entity77 , 57 , works for the @entity5 as a clinical engineering manager			1
mother @entity79 , 51 , has started the fundraising effort with her youngest daughter @entity81 , 20			0
mrs @entity1 , of @entity82 , @entity83 , said @entity81 ’s sister can not be watched 24 hours a day at home and is likely to try to kill herself as soon as she can			1
@entity1 aged eight , when she overheard a comment about her weight that triggered her 16 - year battle with anorexia she believes her daughter will also reject the community care doctors have decided to give her instead of treatment in hospital			1
‘ i think the attitude of the @entity5 is disgusting , ’ said mrs @entity1			1
‘ it comes down to money			0
she ’s in a worse state now than she was when she was admitted to hospital			0
she has had all hope taken away from her			0
it ’s not safe to discharge her			0
’ her family says funding the expensive treatment to cure her would pay for itself by stopping her being a long - term burden on the @entity5			1
mrs @entity1 said her daughter had put on 11lb before she was told her place at @entity105 would not be funded , and is now refusing liquid nutrients			1
‘ she ’s getting weaker and she needs help			0
i hope we can raise the money ourselves before it ’s too late for her , ’ she said			1
the problems began when she was eight and heard a dance teacher say another girl was fat			2
it triggered a lifelong battle against bulimia and anorexia , which she kept secret for years			2
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s a mental illness , not just about eating			1
’ as a teenager , miss @entity1 was thin , fainted regularly and lost a lot of her hair			1
at 18 , she finally admitted to her mother that she was making herself sick			0
she attempted suicide last october and was admitted to @entity126 in @entity31 under the @entity25 and has been there since			0

‘ it ’s like they are trying to keep her alive , but not saving her			0
’ @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity137 said : ‘ the responsibility for funding care placements rests with the commissioners of @entity5 services			0
’ around 1.6million people in @entity145 suffer from eating disorders and a tenth of those are thought to have anorexia			2
the rest have bulimia or other disorders			2
its full name anorexia nervosa , it is often cited as the most lethal mental illness - with a larger ratio sufferers dying than those who have depression or psychosis			0
sufferers tend to focus on food but the illness itself stems from low self - esteem and an inability to cope safely with worries , problems and a lack of control			2
many who have anorexia lower their food intake by skipping meals and cutting down the types and amounts of food they eat ; some over-exercise			2
aside from catastrophically severe weight loss , physical symptoms include difficulty sleeping , dizziness , stomach pains , constipation , feeling cold and hair loss			0
periods can stop for women and sufferers grow soft , fine hair all over their bodies in a condition called @entity193			2
although researchers are given figures by hospitals around @entity145 , it is thought the real toll of sufferers could be much higher because many are reluctant to seek help			0
one symptom is that sufferers shut themselves off from the world and convince themselves that what they are doing is right , even if they are dangerously underweight			0
nine out of ten people with an eating disorder are women - but @entity5 figures suggest there is a growing number of male sufferers			1
specialists tend to use psychological treatments such as counselling , though the most severe cases have to be treated in hospital to ensure patients regain weight safely			0
