so it has once again fallen on @entity1 to prevent the @entity2 suffering a week of complete ignominy in @entity4			1
@entity6 's side have risen to the challenge regularly this season but now they are set for their biggest test here in @entity12 's @entity11			1
can they do it ? @entity14 looks at five reasons why they can keep carrying the flag for @entity17			0
@entity1 's players jog around the running track at @entity12 's @entity11 on wednesday @entity20 had @entity1 travelled here last week , their prospects would not have been so positive but the mood is significantly different thanks to back - to - back victories at @entity26 against @entity27 in the first leg and then @entity29 on sunday			1
it is the first time since november @entity1 have managed to put two results like that together and it has made a big difference to the mood of the squad			1
once this group gets on a roll and has confidence , they can meet challenges head on and they wo n't shirk what is in front of them			0
' we know that it is going to be a tough game , ' said @entity48			0
' we were very impressed with @entity27 in the first leg and they have got good players , like ( @entity52 ) @entity51			2
but we have come here with confidence and we want to go through to the next round			0
' @entity1 midfielder @entity55 scores his side 's final goal in their 3 - 0 win against @entity29 on sunday @entity59 after enduring a difficult spell in the middle of the season , @entity1 's record signing is beginning to deliver big goals at the right moments			1
he has scored 10 goals in his last 14 appearances , including the scruffy penalty which secured a first leg advantage			1
that strike made him @entity1 's leading @entity73 scorer with seven and he has been proficient at coming up with big moments in this competition , such as hat - trick in @entity77 and a group - winning goal in @entity80			1
he will fancy his chances of maintaining that sequence tonight			0
@entity83 celebrates scoring his 10th goal in his last 14 games against @entity29 last weekend club legend @entity86 and @entity1 in the @entity88 coaches deliver a coaching session to local kids different demands , different team if @entity1 have been erratic in the @entity2 , playing in @entity4 has liberated them			1
@entity6 puts domestic struggles down to the fact they lost a lot of ground in the race for fourth place early on and ultimately lost heart for a period			2
in @entity4 , though , they have had a sense of freedom and have been liberated by the chance to achieve something significant			0
they have won six of their nine games so far and the players are determined to not let the opportunity slip			2
' we are going to approach it the way we approach every game , ' said @entity55 , who will have a key role to fulfil			0
' we did well at home and hopefully now we can do that in the away game			0
we have to be positive and give our all			0
' manager @entity6 ( left ) and @entity48 speak to the media ahead of thursday 's last 16 tie @entity6 poses with a group of local children inside @entity12 's @entity11 on wednesday @entity126 ? this is a pithy point but seasons ending with a ' 5 ' have been good for @entity1 ; 1985 saw them win the @entity130			1
1995 brought the @entity131 , their last piece of silverware ; 2005 ended with @entity134 guiding them to a top four finish , while 1915 heralded their second league title			1
@entity1 will , of course , need more than omens to get through but there has long been a feeling within the squad that they have the ability to go all the way to the final in @entity146 and they want to create their own history			2
@entity86 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 hold the @entity130 in 1985 no fear much has been made of @entity12 's formidable home record – they are unbeaten in the @entity11 this season – but @entity1 are not going to sit back and hope to sneak through			1
by playing their natural game , @entity6 believes they have an outstanding chance of progress			2
' we have to be attack minded and when we are on the ball , we need to be a team that wants to score goals and make it very much eye to eye and an open game , ' said @entity6			1
' that 's what i 'm looking for tomorrow , that we can make it a game full of chances for us ' i do n't want it to be a game where they are a home team , and let them see if they can break us down			0
that would be a big mistake			0
it is wanting to achieve something historic and special for us and make our fans proud in @entity4 – which is what we are doing			0
' @entity12 's @entity183 ( right ) celebrates after giving @entity12 the lead at @entity26			2

@entity1 lead 2 - 1 after the first leg of their last 16 @entity188 tie
the @entity1 are in confident mood after winning their last two matches
striker @entity83 has *netted* 10 goals in his last 14 games
years ending in a five have been good for the @entity196 - they won the @entity130 in 1985 and @entity131 in 1995
@entity6 wants his side to play without fear on thursday night
