by @entity0 @entity1 has a wealth of information about what the world is searching for , and now a study has found it can also reveal when political parties are most concerned about climate change			0
by matching @entity11 searches to weather station data , a researcher has discovered @entity13 and people from less educated areas search more during periods of extreme temperatures			1
while @entity18 , and residents of well - educated areas , did so when they experienced changes in average temperatures			1
assistant professor @entity22 from the @entity23 used @entity1 to see how often , when , and where @entity25 citizens searched for ' global warming , ' ( pictured ) ' climate change ' and ' weather			2
' he found @entity13 and people from less educated areas searched more during periods of extreme temperatures the research was carried out by assistant professor @entity22 at the @entity23			1
@entity1 aggregates all @entity11 searches that are made , and measures how popular a specific search term is			0
users can fine tune this to be specific to a particular place , such as a country or city , and time , such as monthly or on a specific date			0
assistant professor @entity22 specifically checked how often , when and where citizens in 205 cities in the @entity25 used the search terms ‘ global warming , ’ ‘ climate change ’ and ‘ weather			1
’ the terms ‘ drought ’ and ‘ flood ’ were also included because increases in these natural phenomena are important predicted impacts of climate change			2
monthly statistics were collected for the period from january 2004 to may 2013			0
assistant professor @entity22 then matched them with local weather station data			2
he found that search activity increased when extreme heat was felt in summer , when no rain fell over extended periods , and when there were fewer extreme cold snaps in winter			1

’ the terms ‘ drought ’ and ‘ flood ’ were also included because increases in these natural disasters have been linked to climate change			2
monthly statistics were collected between january 2004 and may 2013			0
assistant professor @entity22 matched these results with local weather station data , as well as the 2008 presidential election results from @entity87 ’s ‘ @entity86			1
’ he found search activity increased when extreme heat was felt in summer , when no rain fell over extended periods , and when there were fewer extreme cold snaps in winter			1
such weather fluctuations are consistent with projected climate change			0
interestingly though , searches also increased when average winter and spring temperatures dropped - events that are inconsistent with global warming			2
assistant professor @entity22 believes this could mean people who observe unusual extreme weather conditions are genuinely interested in learning more about climate change			2
democrats , and residents of well - educated areas , increased their searches when they experienced changes in average temperatures			1
search activity increased when extreme heat was felt in summer , when no rain fell over extended periods , and when there were fewer extreme cold snaps in winter it could , however , also mean that deniers , who experience an unusually cool winter , go online to confirm their skeptical views that the world is not really growing warmer			1
‘ weather fluctuations have an impact on climate change related search behavior , however not always in ways that are consistent with the impacts of climate change			0
' and the research suggests that different types of people experience weather differently or have different perceptions about what type of weather defines climate change , ‘ concluded assistant professor @entity22			0
findings are published in the @entity133 ’s journal @entity134 .			0

researcher @entity22 used @entity11 to track searches for ' climate change '
he also tracked searches for ‘ weather ’ , ‘ global warming ’ and ‘ drought ’
in addition , @entity22 matched searches with local weather station data
activity increased during extreme summer heat , when no rain fell over extended periods , and when there were fewer extreme cold snaps in winter
*republicans* and people from less - educated areas searched more during periods of extreme temperatures
democrats and residents of well - educated areas did so when they experienced changes in average temperatures
