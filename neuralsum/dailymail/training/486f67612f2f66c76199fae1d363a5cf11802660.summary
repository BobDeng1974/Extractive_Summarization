@entity1 gov. @entity0 blew off on tuesday claims by a nurse that she was treated inhumanely when she was under mandatory quarantine over the weekend for @entity5			1
speculating about the possibility of a lawsuit from the nurse , @entity8 , @entity0 said , ' whatever			1
i 've been sued lots of times before			1
i 'm happy to take it on , ' he added , according to @entity16			0
' there 's been all kinds of malarkey ... about this , ' @entity0 told reporters who trailed while on a campaign stop in @entity47			1
' she was inside the hospital in a climate - controlled area with access to her cell phone , access to the internet , and takeout food from the best restaurants in @entity25 , ' he said			1
@entity0 has been heavily scrutinized over his decision to keep @entity8 in quarantine for several days after she tested negative for @entity5			2
the nurse came from @entity34 by way of a @entity1 airport last week			0
she found herself summarily quarantined by state health officials after they detected she had a slight fever - a common symptom of @entity5			0
but even after the nurse 's fever subsided , health officials kept her confined to a tent at a local hospital that had no shower or flushable toilet			1
she has obtained a high - powered civil rights lawyer to defend her in a potential lawsuit			0
the lawyer , @entity28 , told @entity74 on sunday that @entity8 's quarantine raised ' serious constitutional and civil liberties issues			0
' the @entity1 government has since allowed @entity8 to return to her home in @entity79			0
@entity0 , a possible , 2016 presidential candidate , has denied that her release was an about - face , however			2
he has also refused to rescind the state 's new policy requiring health workers returning from @entity34 to self - quarantine at home for 21 days , the incubation period for @entity5			2
on tuesday he maintained that he did n't think he 'd done anything wrong in keeping her isolated until health officials could be sure she did n't have @entity5			0
' we 're trying to be careful here , ' @entity0 said on @entity96 's today show			2
' this is common sense , and ... the @entity99 public believes it is common sense			0
and we 're not moving an inch			0
our policy has n't changed , and our policy will not change			0
' at the campaign event later that day @entity0 pointed out that the @entity107 staff who were ' on the ground in @entity31 monitoring the conditions she was in ' did n't think the state treated @entity8 unfairly , either			2
' she had access to the @entity114 and we brought her takeout food , ' he said			1
pouncing on @entity0 's comment , @entity116 called some of @entity25 's finest takeout restaurants and found that none of them delivered food to @entity8 - or at least not to the restaurants ' knowledge			1
as @entity0 noted @entity1 officials brought @entity8 the food , so takeout restaurants may not have been away they were feeding the @entity5 patient .			1

' i 've been sued lots of times before , ' @entity0 said *flippantly*
@entity0 disputed the nurse 's claims that she was mistreated
' she was inside the hospital in a climate - controlled area with access to ... takeout food from the best restaurants in @entity25 , ' he said
