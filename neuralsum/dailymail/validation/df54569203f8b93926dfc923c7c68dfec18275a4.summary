diabetes could become a global epidemic affecting one in 12 adults around the world diabetes has become a global epidemic , affecting one in 12 adults , scientists say			2
and the number of sufferers is set to soar by 55 per cent in the next two decades unless the human population drastically changes the way it eats and exercises			1
the study by researchers at the @entity18 estimates that 382million people had diabetes in 2013			1
at current rates , that figure is expected to reach 592million by 2035			1
around 10 per cent of sufferers have type 1 diabetes – an auto - immune disorder that is usually present from childhood			1

‘ the rising prevalence of diabetes in these countries has been fuelled by rapid urbanization , changing eating habits , and increasingly sedentary lifestyles			0
‘ diabetes affects 382 million people worldwide , and that number is expected to grow to 592 million by 2035			2
‘ it is a chronic disease that has spread widely in recent decades - not only in high - income countries , but also in many populous low and middle - income countries such as @entity37 and @entity36			1
’ he added : ‘ we would hope that the findings further increase the policy attention being paid to diabetes prevention and management in rich countries and it should in particular make health and economic policymakers in developing countries aware of the economic damage that diabetes can do			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity42 , cited data from the @entity76 estimating that 8.3 per cent of adults aged 20 to 79 now suffer from diabetes			1

in @entity44 3.2 million people suffer from diabetes and mr @entity46 warned of a hidden cost of carers , many of whom leave their jobs to care for loved ones			2

but it is carers in the @entity44 who are the worst hit financially , with a reduction in income of £ 1327 annually			0
’ that pales in comparison , however , with the @entity116 where the annual diabetes healthcare cost is $ 6,800 ( £ 4,600 ) – and the total economic burden per person reaches $ 283,000 ( £ 191,200 ) over a lifetime .			0
