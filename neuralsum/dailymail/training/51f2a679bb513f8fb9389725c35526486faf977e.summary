these images show the joyful school days of former pupils at the @entity3 in @entity4 , where @entity6 militants slaughtered 132 innocent children on tuesday			1
in pictures obtained by the @entity10 , pupils can be seen happily smiling into the camera on a trip to the mountains , competing in a school sports day and learning in the library			1
they come from the school yearbook of @entity17 , now a phd student at @entity20 's esteemed @entity19 , who credits the school with giving him the solid early education he required to move forward			1
@entity6 militants butchered 132 pupils and nine teachers at the school on tuesday watched by his pupils and teachers , a student leaps through a fiery hoop at a school sports day carrying swords and dressed in ceremonial costume , students perform for their parents in 1999 after witnessing tuesday 's @entity6 attack on his @entity43 , he wrote that he was left with nothing but questions about the atrocity which saw 132 innocent children and nine teachers viciously slain			1
' is there someone else left to blame , before we finally turn on ourselves , ' he asked in a moving article , originally posted on a @entity52			1
' does it end where we begin or does it extend to within our souls ? ' it is a far cry from the happy days he spent in class @entity60 , where one ' library lesson ' now takes on particular poignancy for him			1
after walking up a flight of stairs , through wood - paneled doors into a ' library that was too dark and cold , ' he recalled sitting back in a comfortable chair and reading book , the name of which is long forgotten			2
with the ' forbidding librarian ' looking on , he was drawn into the story about a soldier trying to escape from enemy territory back into his own			2
' it was deathly cold , ' @entity17 said			1
' but the soldier could not ask for shelter			2
instead , when he got tired , he would lie on the ground and will himself to believe that it was warm			2
legs crossed , students sit at a singing competition held at the school			2
many of the dead in the recent @entity6 attack were of a similar age lessons in the library : as teachers look on , pupils study at the exclusive school in @entity26			1
the @entity6 said they selected the army 's school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females teachers pose happily outside the the school in a picture for the 1999 yearbook			1
nine members of staff were among the dead after tuesday 's @entity6 attack it will take days to clean up the carnage at the school ( right ) which was once attended by @entity17 ( right ) who provided the pictures			1
he is now studying for his phd at @entity20 's @entity19 ' it worked for him			2
even in the crippling cold , he could use the power of his mind to believe it was warm and that it would all be fine			2
' around 13 - years later he feared , ' some child would be sitting on that same chair , willing himself to believe that the cold in his attacker 's heart would turn to warmth			2
' ' maybe , after getting shot , he would have spent a few moments thinking about the warmth of his mother 's embrace , ' he said			2
@entity17 also recalled the school 's auditorium where military spokesman , major general @entity135 said the attackers began their killing spree by shooting randomly at the students			1
over 100 bodies were recovered there after the attack			1
' reports state that all their moves were calculated , ' he said , questioning where the @entity6 attackers had entered the room simultaneously or left any of them unguarded			1
there were five exits , four on either side and one at the back , he added			2
' the one at the back would have been the best one for a quick exit , ' he explained			2
' run across a few feet of concrete , past the chalking of quotes attributed to @entity161 ( @entity4 's founder ) , down a dozen steps , and into the trees			2
' those trees , which he could see from his classroom , were within school walls , but nonetheless provided a handy hiding place , away from his teachers ' prying eyes			1
' sometimes , to skip class , or sometimes in break - time , we would walk into the stretch of what i thought of as woods , lining the back wall of the school , ' he said			1
' we would crack silly jokes and look for interesting objects left behind by others as if we were scavenging in a forest , ' he added			1
' when a member of the staff saw us , we would be summoned back to class			0
' nightmare scene : the bloody school auditorium where at least 100 bodies were found			0
@entity17 said there were five exits , four on either side and one at the back shoes lie among blood on the auditorium floor , where pupils were having a @entity199 lecture before the massacre unfolded pools of dried blood is splattered across the floor , amid broken and knocked - over chairs books and note paper litter the floor of the school , dropped as children ran for their lives now he hopes those trees provided cover to pupils from the @entity6 , but he said that from time to time their hiding place would be cut back or down			1
he also feared that the children 's bright green uniforms may have allowed the @entity6 militants to spot them but he said : ' sometimes in the winter months there would be fog			1
' he also hoped that the clean up operation will be thorough enough for those who survived			0
' months from now , when another kid walks into the trees to look for interesting objects left behind by others , will they find a pencil sharpener , a chewed - up pencil , a pack of gum they were n't allowed to chew in class , ' he asked			1
' will there be dried blood on these objects ? how much care will be taken to remove these traces of blood ? ' if he was n't looking out at the trees , @entity17 could also see a small canal from his beloved classroom , which ran parallel to the main road outside the school			1
' there was a period of one or two weeks when we would see soldiers standing on either side of the canal , knee - deep in mud , clearing out the excess deposits , ' @entity248 ' , they called it , ' he said			0
harrowing : a blood - splattered doorway leading to an auditorium at the school in @entity26 , with spectacles on the floor belonging to one of the victims of the massacre the fanatics used suicide vests and grenades in the attack , which left debris strewn across the floors ' i remember thinking our soldiers must not have a lot else to do if they were clearing out canals , ' he added			1
' how long will it take them now to clear out the blood and the insides of children strewn all over the school ? ' he feared some of those bodies would be found in the canteen , where ' the samosas were usually soggy but there was something wonderful about the chutney that i have not seen replicated elsewhere			1
' it was so good he made his mother try some at a parent , teacher meeting but ' she was not impressed , ' telling him it was ' too watery and probably really unhealthy			0
' those children caught in the canteen by the @entity6 ' would probably not have survived , ' he said			1
' it was too open			0
there was no place to hide			0
after the bell rung at the end of the day , he said he would past the main administrative block towards the school 's car park			0
' i would often encounter some teachers and students praying on straw mats strewn on the grass in front of the senior school block , ' he recalled			0
' there would be about 10 - 15 people , and my @entity319 teacher was usually one of them			0
' ' his head was always tilted slightly to the left			2
for him , probably a marker of added involvement and concentration in the prayer			0
for me , an unnecessary display of piety			0
a soldier surveys the damage in the school , as books and paper lie among debris in one of the corridors renowned @entity4 journalist , @entity337 finds the devastation at the @entity3 hard to take he added : ' i wonder if he still taught at the school			1
i wonder if he still tilted his head to the left when he prayed			2
i wonder if the tilt saved his life today			0
i wonder if the lack of a tilt cost the others on the prayer mats their lives			0
' eerily , @entity17 would also walk home past a graveyard , adjacent to the school , which some reports have suggested the attackers scaled the wall of to get in			1
' i remember wondering what it would be like to visit the graveyard as someone whose loved one was buried in it , ' he said			0
' i do not remember there being a lot of empty space in that graveyard			0
thirteen years of urban sprawl have happened since			0
will there be enough space for the bodies , small and big ? when will we run out of space ? ' while holding the @entity6 attackers responsible for the attack , he said : ' when we do go beyond single incidents , we go for neat , comfortable narratives			1
' @entity374 invasion in @entity375			0
the @entity3 's games in @entity375 and @entity379			1
' where do we start and where do we stop , he asked			0
' perhaps monsters are created because we need a visualisation of the evil that our minds can not capture , ' he said			0
' monsters are useful because they distance blame from ourselves			0
' monsters are simple , neat and horrific , ' he added			0
' there is no need for nuance			0
evil is useful because if evil exists then good does too , and we embody the good because we define the evil			0
' ' now we will mourn for three days , ' he said			0
' then , we will stop mourning			0
we forget our own 9/11 's ( there have been too many )			0
how can we expect anyone else to remember ? '			0
