following their easy 4 - 0 win against @entity2 in friday 's @entity4 qualifier @entity0 will face a much sterner test when they travel to @entity6 for an international friendly against @entity8 on tuesday night			1
here , @entity10 's @entity9 reminds you of 10 classic matches between the two sides			1
@entity8 1 - 1 @entity0 , may 1933 , friendly ( @entity14 , @entity15 ) this was the first ever meeting between the two sides , most famous for @entity8 ’s fascist leader @entity18 cheering from the stands and being played in a stadium which translated into @entity21 as the ‘ @entity22 of the @entity23 ’			1
@entity0 ’s squad had to travel by train , setting off from @entity26 , and boat to get to @entity15 for the match			2
@entity8 ’s @entity29 put the home side ahead in the fourth minute , but @entity32 striker @entity31 scored his first @entity0 goal to cancel it out			1
the @entity0 football team pictured at @entity26 as they depart for @entity15 to face @entity8 in 1933 @entity0 3 - 2 @entity8 , november 1934 , friendly ( @entity35 , @entity26 ) this game was labelled ‘ @entity37 ’ afterwards			1
@entity8 defender @entity38 broke his foot in only the second minute and it was full of ferocious challenges			2
@entity8 were perhaps spurred on by reports at the time that @entity18 had offered the players an @entity45 and £ 150 each if they won			2
that incentive back - fired when @entity0 went three goals ahead in the first 12 minutes ; @entity48 scoring three minutes in , adding a second after 10 and @entity49 getting a third			2
they almost managed to throw it away , allowing @entity52 to score twice in the 58th and 62nd minute , but held on for the win			0
@entity0 beat @entity8 3 - 2 ' @entity37 ' during the second meeting between the two teams in 1934 @entity8 0 - 4 @entity0 , may 1948 , friendly ( @entity56 , @entity6 ) the @entity57 were still world champions , having won the @entity58 in 1934 and 1938 and it being cancelled on the next two occasions due to @entity60			1
@entity8 ’s manager was the great double @entity58 winner @entity61 , but they were rocked by @entity63 ’s @entity0			1
@entity65 gave @entity0 a fourth - minute lead , @entity64 added another and @entity68 hit two second - half strikes within two minutes of each other			2
goalkeeper @entity71 , in his first match as captain , pulled off some stunning saves to keep @entity8 out with the score at 2 - 0			0
the result reverberated around the football world			0
@entity68 scores @entity0 's fourth goal as @entity0 beat @entity8 4 - 0 in @entity6 in 1948 @entity8 2 - 3 @entity0 , may 1961 , friendly ( @entity79 , @entity15 ) goals from @entity81 and @entity82 put the scores level at the break , but @entity85 struck another shortly after and with only 13 minutes to play @entity0 were still trailing 2 - 1			1
that was until @entity82 netted his second of the match and with only five minutes remaining former @entity90 striker @entity89 got the winner			0
the match was 54 years ago , but still the last time @entity0 beat @entity8 on their own soil			1
@entity0 and @entity8 line up at the @entity79 in @entity15 ahead of the @entity0 ' 3 - 2 win in 1961 @entity0 3 - 2 @entity8 , may 1976 , friendly ( @entity94 , @entity95 ) @entity0 ’s greatest comeback against the @entity57 came in the @entity97			1
they were two goals behind by half - time , both strikes coming from forward @entity101			0
but in a devastating eight - minute spell after the restart @entity0 were in front			0
former @entity105 striker @entity104 netted a minute from kick off , @entity108 defender @entity107 levelled the match two minutes later and in the 53rd minute @entity110 got the winner			0
@entity0 's @entity112 watches on during @entity0 's 3 - 1 win against @entity8 in @entity95 in 1976 @entity8 2 - 0 @entity0 , november 1976 , @entity114 ( @entity79 , @entity15 ) this was the game which effectively stopped @entity0 qualifying for the 1978 @entity58			1
by the end of the qualifiers , even a draw would have been enough to send them through , but @entity121 scored first and @entity122 , set up by a stroke of genius from @entity125 , sealed the win for the @entity8			0
@entity0 won all of their remaining matches and both teams finished the group joint on points , @entity8 three ahead on goal difference			1
it ended the reign of @entity0 manager @entity134			0
the @entity8 players celebrate as @entity121 gives them the lead against @entity0 in 1976 @entity0 2 - 0 @entity8 , november 1977 , @entity114 ( @entity137 , @entity26 ) the return was meaningless in terms of @entity58 1978 qualification , but @entity141 had succeeded @entity134 as caretaker manager and @entity0 responded to their previous defeat with goals from @entity145 and @entity146			1
it set up @entity147 to go on to the 1982 @entity58 in @entity148 , where they came home undefeated despite being knocked out in the second group stage of the @entity151			0
@entity0 's @entity146 beats keeper @entity153 to score @entity0 's @entity152 in the 1977 qualifier @entity8 1 - 0 @entity0 , june 1980 , @entity157 group stage ( @entity56 , @entity6 ) @entity8 were the home nation for the @entity158 , and essentially sent @entity0 home in the second group match with this slim victory			1
@entity0 badly missed the injured @entity162 and lacked firepower up front			0
his absence proved costly when @entity166 sent the crowd wild with a 79th - minute strike			0
@entity0 managed to beat @entity148 2 - 1 in their final group match , but , at a time when there were only two groups , it was not enough to help them progress			0
@entity153 makes a great save as @entity0 are beaten 1 - 0 by @entity8 in @entity6 in the 1980 @entity157 @entity8 2 - 1 @entity0 , july 1990 , @entity58 third - place playoff ( @entity177 , @entity178 ) @entity0 had been agonisingly knocked out of @entity57 ’ 90 in the semi-finals on penalties by @entity181 , while hosts @entity8 suffered the same fate against @entity184			1
it meant they met in the third - place playoff			0
@entity185 put @entity8 ahead in the 71st minute and 10 minutes later @entity186 levelled			2
but four minutes from time , @entity187 conceded a penalty which @entity189 slotted in to finish as tournament top - scorer with six			0
@entity0 's @entity191 is foiled by @entity192 and @entity193 during the 1990 third - place play - off defender @entity195 appeals next to goalscorer @entity186 during the 2 - 1 win for @entity8 @entity8 0 - 0 @entity0 , october 1997 , @entity58 qualifier ( @entity79 , @entity15 ) this was a bruising , battling performance which left @entity202 covered in blood and forehead bandaged , but @entity0 with the vital draw they needed to qualify for the @entity206 in @entity207			1
the stadium was thick with tension - as was a nation back home in @entity21 - and in the latter stages @entity212 hit a post while @entity8 ’s @entity215 headed narrowly wide			0
the result meant @entity8 would have to qualify for the tournament via a playoff against @entity219 , but @entity0 were through			1
@entity202 was left bloodied after @entity0 's battling draw against @entity8 to secure qualification for 1998 @entity58 plus two that live in the memory , for very different reasons … @entity226 's @entity225 @entity0 0 - 0 @entity8 ( @entity8 win 4 - 2 on penalties ) , june 2012 , @entity229 quarter - final ( @entity79 , @entity230 ) the first 120 minutes were not the most glamorous			2
@entity8 tortured @entity0 with possession and produced 31 shots on goal , but @entity235 ’s players produced a lesson in defending , @entity237 particularly heroic , to take the game to penalties			2
what made this tie was @entity226 ’s genius @entity243 penalty			0
@entity0 were clinging on in the shoot - out until the @entity8 midfielder produced a moment of brilliance , sending @entity248 plunging to his right as the ball floated down the middle with a whirlwind of backspin			2
@entity254 chips the ball straight down the middle during the @entity258 quarter - final penalty shootout @entity260 's first game as captain - and @entity263 's @entity262 @entity8 1 - 0 @entity0 , november 2000 , friendly ( @entity264 , @entity6 ) the match was @entity260 ’s first in charge as captain of the national team - a duty he would continue for many years - but it would end in defeat			1
@entity271 was set to take over and was watching from the stands as caretaker boss @entity273 played an experimental side , in which @entity263 earned his one and only @entity0 cap			0
they lost by a single goal when @entity278 hit an incredible strike in off the crossbar from 30 yards			0
@entity260 salutes the supporters after the defeat by @entity8 in his first game as @entity0 captain			2
