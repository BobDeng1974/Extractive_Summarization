by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 19 october 2013 police forces across the country have wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds by topping up patrol cars with the wrong type of fuel			1
thirty seven constabularies have admitted that their police officers have made countless careless mistakes by filling up diesel engines with petrol and vice versa , costing the taxpayer at least £ 600,000 since 2009			1
in reality , the figure is likely to be even higher given 15 forces in @entity16 and @entity17 provided incomplete information to a @entity20 request filed by @entity21			2
careless : police forces have cost the taxpayer £ 600,000 by putting the wrong type of fuel in squad cars to tackle the problem , @entity27 even installed ' talking fuel caps ' at a cost of £ 4,000 , which play a recorded message reminding officers what fuel was required			1
but it had little affect on the oblivious officers , who pumped petrol into diesel cars no fewer than 150 times between 2008 and 2013 at a cost of £ 32,726 - eight times the cost of the caps themselves			1
but a spokesperson said it had ' ceased to be a matter of great concern ' as there had been a year - on - year decline in the number of incidents recorded			0
the spokesperson added : ' over the years the force has made concerted efforts to reduce these instances of human error			0
' oblivious : despite warning signs and even ' talking fuel caps ' officers have continued to make costly mistakes in @entity62 , bright yellow cap covers were installed in diesel cars seven years ago , but that did not stop officers causing damage costing £ 11,161 over four years			1
@entity67 was handed a bill of £ 2,859 for just one mistake in 2010			0
and the @entity70 , which has a fleet of 6,500 vehicles , has spent £ 288,151 making repairs to 991 of them following errors at the pumps since 2009			1
a spokesperson said : ' if a vehicle is unavailable then clearly that 's not ideal , but we can work around it			0
' they added there is no set punishment that is handed out to the officers who make such mistakes			2
figures from the @entity88 suggest at least 150,000 drivers fill up their cars with the wrong type of fuel each year			2
a spokesman said : ' @entity94 seems to be associated particularly with the growth in diesel car sales			0
' modern diesels are so quiet it 's easy to forget you 're driving one , particularly if it 's a second family car or hire car			0

a *freedom* of information request *reveals* true cost of *refueling* squad cars
officers continue to top up diesel cars with petrol and vice versa
the @entity70 alone has cost taxpayer more than £ *200,000* in mistakes
@entity27 installed ' talking fuel caps ' but the *action* had little affect
