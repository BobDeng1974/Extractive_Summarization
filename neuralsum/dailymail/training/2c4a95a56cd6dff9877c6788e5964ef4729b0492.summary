’ @entity53 for @entity54 , @entity55 , said he was ' very disturbed ' by the recent incident			1
' the fact that a member of staff quickly report this appalling incident and the hospital took immediate action is an example of the culture of candour that must be upheld throughout the @entity66 , ' he said			2

' there was also no improvement in safety and safeguarding , or in treating people with dignity and respect			0
' a damning 2009 health commission report found the hospital subjected patients to poor conditions and inadequate care			2
