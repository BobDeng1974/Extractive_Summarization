struggles : only two years ago , the magazine underwent a major re-design in an attempt to claw its way back to success , the first cover in the new format fronted by @entity41 ( pictured ) material girl : fashion chameleon @entity30 graces this july 2005 issue , looking sharp in a white tweed suit , her hair in a short , curly bob political war : the august 2004 issue was released with two covers , one fronted by former president @entity31 and his wife @entity78 ( right ) , and the other with political opponent @entity80 and his wife @entity81 ( left ) controversial : a radiantly youthful looking @entity82 , posing with husband @entity83 cover this april 2005 cover , in which the @entity86 couple insisted on conducting their interview in the church 's @entity90 headquarters often touching on political hot points , the magazine shot two competing covers for its august 2004 issue - half the newsstand issues featuring @entity31 and his wife @entity78 on the cover , and the other half showing political opponents @entity80 and @entity101 ; both including in - depth interviews with both			1

in it , each member of a couple in a troubled marriage explains their view of the problem , a marriage counselor offers some solutions , and the outcome is published			0
current woes include ' she loves the dog more than me ' , ' he loves sport more than me ' , and ' his elderly parents are too demanding ' - we can only guess what sort of problems were sent in during the @entity151			1

the rest of mrs @entity213 ' story reads like a publishing world fairytale , as it quickly evolved into a model for mass - circulation magazines			0
women 's journal was the first magazine to reach one million subscribers , back in 1903 , and their covers , in their own words , have provided ' a panoramic picture of life in the @entity231 ' since the day the magazine launched			1
pensive : somewhat amusingly , this 1922 cover , which features a boy studying with the cover story entitled ' beginning @entity237 ' seasons change : this beautiful cover , dating to 1919 , advertised for 15 cents , celebrates fall with a unique , autumnal illustration festive : released in 1926 for ten cents , this cover , featuring an angelic young blonde bundled up for the cold , lists a feature entitled ' a @entity245 on the @entity246 ' winding back the hands of time , there exists a large catalog of vintage covers from over the years , including in 1901 illustration of a woman playing golf in a cape and hat , and a 1929 illustration of a young man proposing to his future bride			1
