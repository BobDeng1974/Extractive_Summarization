experts have blamed the rise in the number of children killed on @entity5 's roads on parents failing to properly secure their children in cars the number of children killed or seriously injured on @entity5 ’s roads has risen for the first time in two decades because of complacency over seatbelts			1
experts and motoring groups last night blamed the first full year rise since 1995 on parents failing to properly secure their children in cars			1
the number of youngsters killed or seriously injured rose by 3 per cent to 2,060 in the year to september 2014 , official statistics revealed			1
the @entity22 described the figures as ‘ shocking ’ and pointed to a study by the @entity5 ’s @entity25 that found that 13 per cent of child passengers were not properly restrained			1
this compares with just 1.9 per cent of drivers caught failing to wear a seatbelt			2
even when parents do try to secure their children in their car , many still fail to do so properly either through ignorance or by accident			1
a which ? survey last year revealed nine out of ten shops – including major high street names – made ‘ potentially lethal mistakes ’ when showing parents how to install their child and baby car seats properly			2
motoring groups said it was time to bring back children ’s road safety campaigns such as @entity46 and @entity47 the @entity48 , updated for the digital generation of youngsters			2
but campaigners also claimed the figures highlighted how the government ’s road safety record had ‘ slammed into reverse ’ as the total number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads rose by 4 per cent to 24,360 compared with the previous year			1
road deaths were up by 1 per cent to 1,730 in the year to september 2014			2
total casualties rose by 5 per cent to 192,910 compared with the previous year			0
even slight casualties were up 5 per cent to 168,540			0
the @entity63 ’s latest road casualty report concluded : ‘ @entity64 and seriously injured ( @entity66 ) casualties have risen in each quarter of 2014 in comparison with the same periods in 2013			1
these increases have now resulted in the first rise in rolling year comparisons in child @entity66 casualties since the year ending march 1995			0
’ interestingly , the death and serious injury rate among child pedestrians decreased by 1 per cent over the same period – suggesting it is children in cars bearing the brunt of the rise			2
child casualties ‘ of all severities ’ also rose by 6 per cent to 16,640 compared with 2013			0
for the three - month summer period of july to september last year the total number of under - 16s killed or seriously injured – including those travelling in vehicles – was up 1 per cent to 580			1
the number of youngsters killed or seriously injured rose by three per cent to 2,060 in the year to september 2014 , official statistics have revealed ( file picture ) yet here again the figure for child pedestrians was down by 1 per cent			1
overall child pedestrian casualties last summer were down 7 per cent			0
@entity22 president @entity95 said : ‘ these latest road casualty statistics do not make for happy reading			0
‘ they indicate a clear rise in in - car child casualties			0
there is anecdotal evidence to suggest this could be linked to the failure of parents to properly fit their children ’s child seats			1
‘ there is also separate research showing that some parents may not be keeping their children belted up in the back			2
‘ the statistics highlight the need for a continued focus on driver education , improved road conditions and a strong presence from traffic police officers			0
’ the road safety charity brake said after years of improvement ‘ the government has slammed on the brakes and gone into reverse ’			0
@entity126 of the @entity127 said the figures should be a ‘ wake - up call ’ to ministers : ‘ it is alarming to see that years of progress on road safety appears to have come to an abrupt halt			0
’ the @entity63 figures revealed a 2.1 per cent rise in traffic volumes in summer 2014 compared with the previous summer			0
it could not definitively blame issues with child car seats for the rise , it said , but confirmed this was an issue it would look into			0
transport minister @entity145 said : ‘ @entity5 ’s roads are still among the safest in the world and there are 40 per cent fewer road deaths per year than a decade ago			1

number of children killed or seriously injured on @entity5 's roads has risen
figure gone up for the first time in two decades because of complacency
experts blame parents failing to properly secure their children in cars
number of children killed or seriously injured rose by 3 *%* to 2,060 in 2014
