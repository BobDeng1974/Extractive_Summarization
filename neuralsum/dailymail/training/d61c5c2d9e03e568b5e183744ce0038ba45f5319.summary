@entity18 thug @entity5 , 32 , ( left ) has been jailed after he ran up and kicked @entity7 's head ' like taking a penalty ' at a music festival			2
mr @entity14 ( right ) lost four of his teeth in the attack in june @entity5 , from @entity24 , who appeared to be smirking in his police mugshot , admitted causing actual and grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing at @entity28 and has now been jailed for 18 months			1
he had fled the scene after the attack - jumping into a stranger 's car before asking them to get him away from the scene			0
however , he was found after the couple saw appeals for information about an unrelated suspected murder at the festival on the same day and contacted police			2
@entity5 's blood was found in the vehicle and though he was not connected to the death of festival - goer @entity44 - who died after he was punched at the event , he was linked to assaults on mr @entity14 and mr @entity17			1
@entity5 was caught on mobile phone footage running at victim mr @entity14 and kicking him in the face at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , in june @entity51 court was told @entity5 had been talking to a woman in the @entity54 tent at @entity11 , on friday june 7 , when he was attacked by two men			1
he then mistakenly believed mr @entity14 and mr @entity17 were responsible - and launched his own savage attack			0
mr @entity14 lost four of his teeth , and both men suffered facial injuries in the attack , which one witness described as if @entity5 was running up to take a penalty kick			2
@entity63 , mitigating , said his client had been ' disgusted and shocked ' when shown footage of his actions , which happened in a ' moment of madness '			0
but judge @entity69 told @entity5 : ' if ever there was a case of violence begetting violence this is it			0
' a punch would have been one thing but i think the description given that it looks like someone running up to take a penalty kick at a football is much more accurate			0
' that 's what struck me and someone present and the ball is the head , that could 've caused very serious injuries			0
this could easily have been a case in which someone 's life was lost			0
' @entity5 , who has ten previous convictions for offences including common assault , possession of heroin and perverting the course of justice , pleaded guilty to one charge of actual bodily harm and one of grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing			1
