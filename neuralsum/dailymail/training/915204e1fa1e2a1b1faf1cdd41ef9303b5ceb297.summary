you have no rights or feelings			0
you are simply a nuisance			0
you have to stay silent			0
no matter what , just stay silent			0
" ' @entity9 ends her column with ' today , i am choosing to reveal my porn identity to the world			1
my name is @entity8 , and i wear my @entity77 with pride			1
' @entity9 's story came to light last month after the @entity14 ran an article about how the trouble started for ' @entity11 ' when fellow college freshman @entity83 came up to her and asked her if she was the same girl as the adult film star he 'd been watching			1
@entity9 admitted that she acted in pornographic films under a stage name , but swore him to secrecy			1

' if you b * * * ed her , report in , ' wrote one anonymous poster on the @entity110 message board			0

' in that story , the author took note of @entity9 's ' designer bag ' and new @entity135 as proof of her porn - riches			1
higher learning : @entity14 students took to the internet to criticize @entity11 's career choices and speculate who might have had sex with her however , @entity9 was n't entirely pleased with the @entity14 's representation			1
while she thanked them for giving her a forum she also accused them of skewing her words and betraying her trust in a response on the blog @entity152 , adding that they had ' portrayed me as a naïve , attention seeking little girl who flaunts her wealth			0
' she went even further detailing her life in pornography and the lack of impact she expects it to have on her future in a first - hand account published on @entity31 later that week			0
' i could n't afford $ 60,000 in tuition , my family has undergone significant financial burden , and i saw a way to graduate from my dream school free of debt , doing something i absolutely love , ' @entity9 - as ' @entity11 ' - wrote			2
' because to be clear : my experience in porn has been nothing but supportive , exciting , thrilling and empowering			2

' everyone has their kinks and we should not shame anyone for enjoying something that is perfectly legal and consensual for all parties involved , ' she wrote			0
first - hand : in an article on @entity31 , @entity11 said she had no fear of porn impacting her future career as she would n't want to work for anyone who held it against her ' for me , shooting pornography brings me unimaginable joy			1
when i finish a scene , i know that i have done so and completed an honest day 's work			2
it is my artistic outlet , my love , my happiness , my home			0
' finally , she shot back at critics who claimed she was being degraded : ' i can honestly say that i have never felt more empowered or happy doing anything else			0
