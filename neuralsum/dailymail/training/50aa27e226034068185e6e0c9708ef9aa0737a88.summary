by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the somnolent start to @entity4 ’s tour was rudely interrupted at @entity5 yesterday by an injury scare to one of their most important batsmen			2
@entity10 , the star of @entity4 ’s @entity12 triumph last year , was struck a nasty blow on the arm by the most impressive member of @entity17 ’s second - string attack on an otherwise carefree day of batting			1
@entity19 , a left - arm seamer of some pace but only one first - class match , kept @entity4 ’s formidable line - up on their toes and forced @entity10 to retire hurt in this warm - up game when he hit him on the elbow after he had reached 60			1
agression : @entity19 , who has only ever played one first class match , was a thorn in the tourists ' side worry : @entity10 receives treatment after being hit on the arm by a @entity33 delivery retired hurt : @entity10 left the field after the incident but @entity4 insisted his retirement was not forced @entity4 later insisted that @entity10 was fine and was about to retire anyway , in keeping with a practice - game philosophy familiar to observers of @entity4 coach @entity41 ’s dismissive approach to tour matches			1
yet it was still reminiscent of the incident this time last year when a rapid left - arm bowler in @entity46 struck @entity49 ’s @entity48 a nasty blow in a warm - up match at @entity51 and almost put him out of the @entity52			2
only this time it was an opposition player who was undone by friendly fire			0
certainly @entity49 will not want the flamboyant @entity10 , who smashed 187 off 174 balls on his @entity56 against @entity57 , to arrive at @entity58 for the first test on july 9 with too many runs and form under his belt			0
to that end @entity33 , who gained considerable pace and movement with the new ball , will have pleased @entity49 no end by ruffling @entity10 ’s feathers and generally keeping @entity4 ’s batsmen honest on a day when they cruised to 333 - 4			1
runs : @entity71 looked good during his 49 - ball stay at the crease , but was bowled for 29 solid : @entity75 was one of two players to retire out after making it to a half - century on the pull : @entity79 finished the day 47 not out as @entity17 caused the tourists few problems the @entity83 - born left - armer played a single first - class game for @entity85 before running into disciplinary problems with @entity87 and then embarking on a nomadic search for a new county that has ended with him trying to establish himself at @entity5			2
on this evidence @entity17 , bottom of @entity93 without a victory this season , should give him a go			0
other than @entity33 , 23 , there was not a lot to trouble an @entity4 team who had rendered this opening match non-first - class by insisting on using all 18 members of their squad over the three days , starting with a team of batsmen yesterday			1
in the circumstances @entity17 did well to take the wickets they did , with @entity113 falling to a catch by @entity115 , younger brother of @entity117 , and @entity118 being bowled by a beauty from @entity120			0
rare breakthrough : @entity71 was bowled by @entity120 playing a loose shot but @entity4 dominated disappointment : @entity71 missed the chance to get some early runs on a tour where @entity4 could trouble @entity49 other than that it was a tale of retirements , with @entity128 and @entity129 both calling it a day soon after reaching 50 and @entity79 and @entity131 then helping themselves to some easy runs			1
@entity4 made a bigger splash off the field yesterday when @entity136 was confirmed as the first chairman of the @entity138 despite being barred from his role as president of the @entity142 board by the @entity143			0
driving away : @entity144 plays a good shot as @entity4 piled on the runs against @entity17 rising force : @entity10 , who averages almost 50 in his seven tests , looked in good form before getting hurt the elevation of @entity136 is part of the controversial ‘ power grab ’ of the world game by the boards of @entity4 , @entity49 and @entity57 and comes even though he has been forced out of power , for now at least , in his home country as part of an investigation into corruption in the @entity160			2
@entity162 , who struck a maiden @entity56 century of high class in a losing cause at @entity166 on tuesday , is the only member of the @entity49 team beaten by @entity168 who will feature in county cricket ahead of the first test against @entity4			0
the other players , including under pressure captain @entity172 , will prepare for @entity58 in a two - day training camp at @entity174 next tuesday and wednesday instead .			0

@entity4 reach 333 - 4 in tour match against lowly @entity17
@entity178 took a blow to the arm from @entity33 , retired hurt on 60
50s for @entity183 and @entity129 against second - string attack
