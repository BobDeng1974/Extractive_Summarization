incredible before and after images have revealed a fresh lunar scar created by the biggest explosion ever recorded on the moon 's surface			1
the moon is pelted with cosmic debris all the time , but this relatively recent crater was created by an object the size of a small boulder			1
scientists watched the object explode as it hit the surface in @entity14 creating a flash of light 10 times as bright as anything ever recorded on the moon before			1
slide the middle bar to see how the moon 's surface changed after impact when a meteoroid strikes the moon , a large portion of the impact energy goes into heat and excavating a crater			1
however , part of it also goes into generating visible light , which results in a brilliant flash at the point of impact			2
the images reveal intricate details of the resulting impact crater and could help scientists learn more about how craters form			1
the brightest flash occurred on march 17 , 2013 with coordinates 20.6 ° n , 336.1 ° @entity46 the team predicted the crater 's size based on the energy , and then eagerly awaited @entity51 ; s next pass over the location to confirm their calculations			1
being able to get observations before , during and after the impact is a valuable opportunity to understand impact events better			0
four different mages of a crater formed on the moon , march 17 , 2013 ; each scene is 1837ft ( 560 metres ) wide			1
the brightest flash occurred on march 17 , 2013 with coordinates 20.6 ° n , 336.1 ° e comparing the actual size of the crater to the brightness of the flash helps validate impact models			1
the crater itself is small , measuring 61.7ft ( 18.8 metres ) in diameter , but its influence is large ; debris excavated by the sudden release of energy flew for hundreds of metres			1
more than 200 related surface changes up to 19 miles ( 30km ) away were noted			0
scientists could be closer to finding water on the moon - a discovery that could help create rocket fuel and breathable air for future colonies			1
using data from the @entity90 's @entity89 tool , @entity86 scientists have been mapping the hydrogen levels across the moon craggy deposits			1
and they 've found surprisingly higher levels of hydrogen in a very specific area ; the slopes of craters in the moon 's southern hemisphere facing the @entity100			2
these slopes could be mankind 's best hope finding drinkable water on the lunar surface , they claim			0
@entity107 could be found as either hydroxol - which is a single atom bound with a single oxygen atom - or it may be two hydrogen atoms bound with oxygen			2
scientists believe lunar water could be used for drinking or its components – hydrogen and oxygen – may be used to manufacture rocket fuel or even breathable air			0
not only did the @entity51 images reveal intricate details of ejecta distribution , but they also offered a valuable opportunity to study the structure of the top meter of the regolith			0
@entity126 is a term that refers to a soil that is lacking organic material			0
the soil on the moon is formed slowly over time as micrometeorites impact the surface and slowly grind rocks into a fine powder			2
as the fresh soil grains sit on the surface , they are exposed to radiation and slowly become darker and redder			0
this is largely caused by a reduction of iron in minerals to iron metal – reverse of rusting that happens on @entity147			0
this slow change in reflectance and colour is generally referred to as space weathering ; fresh soil is referred to as immature , and weathered soil is mature			0
several surprises were revealed in the before and after image pairs around the new crater			2
conventional thought predicted that the new crater should be surrounded by a high reflectance ejecta with some patchy debris spreading out two or three diameters			2
' the high reflectance was there , but three other zones were discovered , ' said @entity164 , a professor in @entity165 of @entity147 and @entity166 and @entity51 's principal investigator			0
' at the edge of the high reflectance ejecta was a low reflectance zone , then , beyond that , another high reflectance zone , and beyond that , another low reflectance zone			0
' it 's not easy to find new impact craters because most of them are very small			0
the only way to really do this is to have a before image and an after image to compare			0
with the help of the automated tool , the team has identified 225 new impact craters ranging in size from 4.9ft to 140ft ( 91.5 meters to 43 metres ) and over 25,000 small changes known as ' splotches '			2
using data from the @entity90 's @entity182 ( artist 's impression pictured ) , @entity86 scientists discovered the crater itself is small , measuring 61.7ft ( 18.8 metres ) in diameter , but its influence is large ; debris excavated by the sudden release of energy flew for hundreds of metres			1

@entity86 watched a boulder - sized object explode on march 17 2013
its flash was 10 times as bright as anything ever recorded on moon
resulting crater in @entity14 is 61.7ft ( 18.8 metres ) in diameter
