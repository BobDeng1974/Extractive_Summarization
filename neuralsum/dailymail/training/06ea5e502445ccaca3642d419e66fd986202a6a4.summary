by @entity0 a wearable sensor made of gold wires has been created by @entity4 scientists and could help develop an electronic skin capable of monitoring a person 's blood pressure , pulse and heartbeat			1
the highly sensitive wire used for the pressure sensor is as thin as human skin and could also potentially be used to design cheap phone or tablet touch screens that are prone to cracking			2
@entity17 's dr @entity16 said the sensor had great potential for monitoring people 's health anytime and anywhere			0
these results have particular implications for future " at - home " diagnostic tools for elderly or disabled people , ' dr @entity16 said			0
the researchers from the university and the @entity47 used the thinnest gold wire produced to design the sensor , which is about two nanometres thick â€“ a nanometre is one billionth of a metre			2
' we chose the ultrathin gold nanowires because they are mechanically flexible and have good conductivity , yet are very robust which makes them highly suitable for wearable devices , ' dr @entity16 said			0
the sensor 's robust flexibility means it could be worn as a diagnostic device to detect blood pressure or pulse in real time and under various conditions , including during exercise or sleep			1
dr @entity16 said while the team had only produced a patch - size sensor at this stage , the fabrication process could easily be replicated on a much larger scale			1
the research was published in @entity74			0
