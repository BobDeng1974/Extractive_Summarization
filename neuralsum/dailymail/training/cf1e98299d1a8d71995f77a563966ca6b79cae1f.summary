what is the price of being forced to raise a brown baby ? it 's an unusual question , arising from an unusual lawsuit prompted by an insemination gone wrong			1
and it has set off an extraordinary discussion touching on sensitive issues of race , motherhood , sexuality and justice , though the debate begins with one basic premise : you should get what you pay for			0
@entity17 and her wife , @entity18 , wanted a white baby			1
they went to the @entity21 near @entity22 and chose blond , blue - eyed donor no. 380 , who looked like he could have been related to @entity26			1
when @entity17 was five months pregnant , they found out that she had been inseminated by donor no. 330 — a black man			1
' the couple did not get what they asked for , which was a particular donor			2
the company made a mistake , and it should have to pay for that , ' says @entity35 , an information technology professional in suburban @entity37			0
mix - up : @entity17 ( right ) has filed a lawsuit which cites the stress and anxiety of raising her daughter @entity42 , ( pictured ) , in a predominantly white @entity44 town , which she describes as intolerant mothers : @entity17 ( right ) is seen with her wife @entity18 ( left ) @entity47 is black and lesbian , with a white partner			1
they considered insemination of the white partner before choosing to adopt. when looking at donors , they wanted sperm from a black donor , to create a biracial baby that would have shared some physical characteristics with both of them			1
' they 're not saying anything racist , they 're not saying we do n't want a black baby , ' @entity35 said of @entity17 and @entity18 , who profess their love for their now 2 - year - old daughter			1
' they 're saying , we asked for something , you gave us something different , and now we have to adjust to that			0
' that ' adjustment ' is a major justification for @entity17 's lawsuit			2
it cites the stress and anxiety of raising a brown girl in predominantly white @entity81 , @entity44 , which @entity17 describes as intolerant			1
some of her own family members have unconscious racial biases , the lawsuit says			1
that leads some to believe that @entity17 is asking to be paid for the difficulties that many black folks — and white parents of adopted black children — deal with for free			1
' i do n't think i deserve anything more being the white parent of a black child than any parent of a black child does , ' says @entity97 , who adopted her daughter			2
strangers have asked @entity97 why she did n't adopt a white baby			1
one remarked in front of her white then - husband that @entity97 must have cheated with a black man			1
too many white people to count have pawed her daughter 's hair			2
' it 's hard , but being a parent is hard , ' says @entity97 , who lives in @entity109 and is author of ' @entity111 : a parent 's @entity113			0
' ' being a parent is going to throw things at you that you never expected , and we make a decision that we 're going to roll with it , because we love our kids and they deserve it , ' she says			0
@entity97 agrees that a company should be held liable for promising one thing and doing another			0
but she thinks the fact @entity17 waited more than two years to sue indicates that the experience of raising a black child is her real problem			1
mistake : when @entity17 was five months pregnant , they found out that she had been inseminated by a black man ' when you say this is too hard , i did n't deserve this , this is too much for me to handle , then the child internalizes it and it affects their self - esteem , ' she says			1
' it 's my job to pour self - esteem into my daughter , not tear it down			2
' from the days of @entity146 slavery through the 1960s , white men fathering children with black women was commonplace and tacitly accepted — yet there were few things as scandalous as a white woman with a brown baby			1
that history makes @entity153 , author of the @entity155 blog , say that the lawsuit is ' rooted in fear			0
stuck in the muck and mire of racism and the purity of white lineage			0
' ' she simply can not fathom dealing with what it means to , in essence , be a @entity167 mom , having to navigate and negotiate a racist world on behalf of a human she bore , in an environment of which she is a product , ' @entity153 wrote			0
@entity173 , co-author of ' @entity174 , @entity175 : experiencing @entity177 adoption , ' says that the lawsuit reflects @entity146 's unexamined racist attitudes and @entity17 's angst over having a biracial child			2
he notes that due to supply and demand , it costs about half as much to adopt a black child as a white one , and many black boys in foster care are never adopted			2
' this lawsuit demonstrates quite nicely the value of skin color , ' says @entity173 , a professor at @entity192			0
yet @entity17 's defenders say she should not be held responsible for being unprepared			2
trouble : some of @entity17 's own family members have unconscious racial biases , her lawsuit says parenthood : @entity17 's defenders say she should not be held responsible for being unprepared to raise her daughter @entity42 ' white people who are n't affiliated with black people do n't necessarily understand the challenges that black people face in all facets of their life			1
this couple was n't expecting that , and now they have to deal with it , ' says @entity209 , who owns a youth sports business in @entity211			0
' she did n't ask for a biracial baby			0
she was given one , she loves it , she adores it , now she 's facing challenges and admits it			0
that does n't make her a racist , ' @entity209 says			0
' you ca n't fault her for what she was not exposed to , ' she says			0
' her only obligation is to love and raise her child in the best environment possible			0
and if the money will help her do that , then good for her			0
