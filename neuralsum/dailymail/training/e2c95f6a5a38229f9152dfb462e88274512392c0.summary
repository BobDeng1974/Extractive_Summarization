@entity7 , 13 , was told the green and red tags on her @entity10 shoes broke an ' all - black ' uniform rule at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but she was shocked when a staff member apparently knelt down and cut off the tags - while the shoes were on her feet			2

despite being offered £ 55 by the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , her mother has gone to police the tags which were cut off shoes belonging to 13 - year - old @entity7			1
her mother said : ' i 'm fuming ' a separate pair of shoes - not owned by @entity7 - which shows how the labels looked before they were cut off her mother @entity29 immediately complained to head teacher @entity30 - who apologised and offered her £ 55 to buy a new pair			1
but ms @entity32 took the row to police , insisting the staff member committed criminal damage and assault			1
the row has since escalated when @entity7 was suspended for a week for naming the teacher on @entity40			1
