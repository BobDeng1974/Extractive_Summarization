by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 03:10 est , 13 june 2013 with their historic mansions and quaint tea shops - @entity3 venues seem like the perfect family day out			2
but the charity has its eye on a rather different audience - as it prepares to host burlesque nights in stately homes			1
in a bid to attract younger visitors two racy performances featuring cocktails and scantily - clad dancers will be held , after last year saw a four per cent decline in visitors across the country			1
the national trust has its eye on a different audience at the @entity24 estate in @entity25 vintage : @entity3 hopes hosting burlesque nights will help attract a younger crowd the trust will seek to change perceptions to give off a less ‘ buttoned - up ’ impression to younger audiences			1
to reassure members concerned about the trust sexing up its image , a spokesman said performances would be ‘ tasteful ’ with dancers ‘ showing off their corsets , feathers and pearls ’			1
organiser @entity43 told the @entity45 : ‘ it is a family event , so the burlesque dancers will be quite tame			0
‘ it is supposed to be a bit light - hearted			2
they wo n’t be getting completely naked , let ’s put it that way			0
this is the ﬁrst time they have performed anywhere like this			0
’ @entity57 , a visitor services ofﬁcer for the trust , said : ‘ we ’ve never tried anything like this before but with the backdrop of the house and garden it seemed like the perfect setting for an evening of cocktails and nostalgic appeal			0
’ the first event will be held on june 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in @entity24 , @entity25 , which is known for its collection of historical costumes			1
one of the reasons for the turn to burlesque nights is the fact that there was a four per cent decline in the number of visitors to @entity3 properties across the country last year two models pose on a vintage car			0
the trust hopes to give off a less ' buttoned - up ' impression of its properties the first event will be held on june 22 and 23 at the 18th century house in @entity24 , @entity25 , which is known for its collection of historical costumes performers will include @entity91 ’s @entity90 and singer @entity92 , with adult tickets costing £ 18.50			1
the second will be at at @entity95 , featuring the @entity96 whose dancers include @entity98 , miss @entity99 and miss @entity100			0
last year it was reported the organisation - of which prince @entity103 is president — was launching an @entity105 digital guide to @entity107 ’s red - light district			1
it was a far cry from the @entity3 ’s mantra ‘ to preserve and protect historic places and spaces ’			0
former @entity113 prisons minister @entity112 , said she was appalled by the charitable body ’s attempt to update its image			2
she said : ‘ i fail to understand how getting young people to listen to these stories of @entity119 relates in any way to the important and historic work of the @entity3			0
’ ‘ in fact if this is the @entity3 ’s idea of attracting new members , i suggest they go for a brisk walk in the countryside to clear their brains and recover their senses			0
’ the @entity3 events may raise an eyebrow among some traditional members who have previously also voiced concerns over the organisation ’s so - called ‘ @entity135 ’ drive			1
this is where the organisation has attempted to make its properties more appealing to younger visitors with innovations such as guides dressed in period costumes and interactive displays .			2
