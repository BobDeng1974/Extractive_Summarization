in an address to political journalists at the @entity17 dinner , held last night at the @entity18 , mr @entity7 poked fun at his thinning hair while making jibes about @entity22 , @entity23 and the rebel mps within his party			1

' the fresh attention on the @entity37 hairdo comes after the @entity39 's honours list featured mr @entity7 's hairdresser , @entity40 , who received an mbe for ' services to hairdressing '			1
mr @entity44 , who cuts and styles the prime minister 's hair for Â £ 90 a time and is held responsible for his trademark side - parting , came in for another round of praise last night , though mr @entity7 insisted he did not know about the award in advance			1
he said : ' if you can make cuts and stop recession at the same time , you deserve an honour			0
' mr @entity7 's bald spot has been the subject of media speculation for some time			1
bald patch 7 december 2005 , left , and 5 october 2010 , right it has been photographed on occasion since he took over as the leader of the @entity64 in 2005 , though it is often skilfully covered			2
the dinner at which mr @entity7 was speaking , held in the @entity67 ' dining room in the @entity18 , is a smaller - scale version of the @entity70 ' dinner held by the president each year			1
it is the first to be held in 1974			0
out again : mr @entity7 's hair on this visit in @entity75 in december 2011 commenting on his grand surroundings - and making a reference to his past as a member of the notorious @entity80 while he was at @entity81 , mr @entity7 said : ' the last time i was at a dinner this posh , @entity23 [ @entity82 ] spent the rest of the night in prison			1

according to the prime minister , she said : '' @entity23 , you 're the father of one of my children			0
' but she quickly revealed that it was a joke by clarifying : ' it 's your daughter , i 'm her maths teacher			0
' mr @entity7 also made light of troubles within his own party , saying that a rebellious letter sent to him by backbench mps demanding the power to veto @entity108 laws never actually materialised			1
he told his audience : ' the only problem was that there was no letter , they did n't send it and it did n't have 95 signatures '			0
however , one backbencher , @entity116 , came in for praise from the prime minister after she decided to appear on @entity120 's @entity119 , hosted by @entity121 , to raise money for charity			0
he said : ' if every @entity64 mp who 's taken their clothes off in recent years had had such noble intentions , we would be in a much better position			2

covered : mr @entity7 's bald patch is rarely visible			1
in a picture , left , taken in @entity137 in april he sports a full - looking head of hair , and appears similar hirsute meeting @entity142 and a @entity144 event last november he pointed out : ' we both love @entity146 , we both love @entity147 - for different reasons - and we both like the @entity149			2

' the prime minister finished his address by praising the ' tenacious ... often uncomfortable ' nature of the @entity159 , which he made clear is vital to preserve democracy			0
he said : ' at its best , the @entity163 press and the political press has a vital role to play in our country , ' said the prime minister			0
