the small , red squid came out on top by using its sharp beak after an hour - long battle with a much bigger owlfish which was captured on film in @entity14 , @entity15			1
in the images , the squid grips the fish around the head as the two of them tussle and sink deeper into the sea			2
a mobile vehicle , called the @entity42 , spotted the pair at about 1,475 feet below the surface			1
@entity45 , an @entity40 senior research technician , said they watched the struggle for about 50 minutes before returning to the surface			1
speaking to @entity49 , she said : ' they were sinking rapidly the whole time , and we think that 's part of the squid 's tactic			2
we see a lot of feeding events , and oftentimes the squid gets startled and lets go , but this guy held on for the whole time that we watched it			0
' the squid and owlfish dropped to a depth of 1,970 feet during the altercation tight grip : this owlfish was being held too tightly to escape and is twisted in the squid 's tentacles brutal : tentacles also cover the fish 's gills - perhaps in an attempt to suffocate it the squid and owlfish dropped to a depth of 1,970 feet during the altercation			1
an owlfish can escape a squid by shedding its scales to slip away from its tentacles or by flicking its tail			0
but this owlfish was being held too tightly to escape and as the video progresses , the fish is twisted in the squid 's tentacles and being bitten until it gives up			0
tentacles also cover the fish 's gills - perhaps in an attempt to suffocate it			0
the @entity91 battle was between a 10 to 12 inch long owlfish and the smaller four to five inch squid .			0
