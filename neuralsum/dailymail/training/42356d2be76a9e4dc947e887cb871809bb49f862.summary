’ the scene takes place in the two - bedroom east @entity64 flat of pregnant @entity66			0
she lives there in near - squalor with her out - of - work husband and eight young children because the council refuses to upgrade them to a bigger property			0
mrs @entity66 is dismayed at the prospect of adding to her already struggling family and so enlists the help of a neighbour to perform the abortion , selling her wedding ring to pay for it			2
the neighbour , a herbalist named mrs @entity84 , arrives with a rubber sheet , which she rolls out on the kitchen table , and cloth - bound set of rusty tools			0
mrs @entity66 climbs onto on the make - shift gurney and lies on her back with her knees bent , writhing in pain as mrs @entity84 gets to work			2
a @entity94 forum member described the scene as ‘ harrowing , from the rubber sheet going on the table to the way she screamed in pain ’			0
another wrote : ‘ could n’t watch the botched illegal abortion scene , had me squirming			2
’ throughout the procedure the camera repeatedly cuts to and from an unrelated scene in which one of the midwives , @entity108 , is getting ready for a date			0
true to life : the @entity4 defended the decision to show the scene saying it reflects the real life of nurses and women in the @entity116 in the 50 's ( pictured ) using sharp implements she files her nails and pushes back her cuticles , before painting blood - red varnish on top , which drips into pools on the floor			1
but the editing did little to hide the horrors of the unfolding abortion scene			2
one viewer wrote on a @entity4 message board : ‘ the flicking between the procedure and the filing / painting of nails actually made me wince more than if they ’d just shown the lady screaming			1
‘ very imaginative way of depicting the horror pre water shed			0
’ earlier in the episode mrs @entity66 had tried other unconventional methods to rid herself of the unwanted baby			0
@entity5 is a @entity4 period drama based on the memoirs of late author @entity144			1

@entity154 starred until the departure of her character , @entity156			0
the role won her a @entity158 for outstanding drama performance and she was also nominated for a @entity160			0
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ @entity5 is inspired by the reality of @entity116 life in the 1950s and prior to the legalisation of abortion , back street terminations were a documented phenomenon			1
' @entity5 has never shied away from the tough conditions and difficult decisions made by pregnant women throughout this era and the series has become a critical and popular success thanks to its frank and honest approach			1
’ they included drinking gin in a scolding hot bath , punching herself in the stomach and taking @entity181 salts			0
and before deciding to go through with the abortion she had sent her husband out for knitting needles and a crochet hook , with the intention of performing it herself			2
shots of mrs @entity66 ’s blood - soaked clothes and sickened face are followed by others of her in a hospital bed , having contracted septicaemia and collapsed into a coma			0
the episode ends with her making a full recovery and moving to the country with her family to start a new life			0
but viewers were left feeling upset and angry over what they had been exposed to			1
@entity204 of @entity205 said : ‘ broadcasters need to take responsibility and realise that children will have watched this , especially since it is half term week for a lot of schools around the country so they will have been up later			0
‘ we all know that they [ back alley abortions ] happened and the problems that they caused but we do n’t need to view it on television			1
‘ it ’s not that i think we should hide things or pretend they did n’t happen but i just think that sometimes it is something that needs to be told in the context of a different situation to a television programme			0
‘ it ’s something children will learn about , but during school education in an informed way , not on television in a graphic way			2
’ @entity235 , @entity236 ( @entity237 ) said : ‘ back - street abortion is shocking and upsetting but this was the grim reality for women in @entity240 before abortion became legal in 1967			1
@entity237 started running contraception clinics in the 1930s and what happened to women like ‘ @entity66 ’ in @entity5 is well documented			1
' while it can be difficult to read or watch , the issue must n’t be airbrushed			0
some women died and many others suffered terrible health conditions as a result and this reminds us of a situation we must never go back to			2
