@entity0 and @entity1 may become a united force again in seasons to come			1
they could continue as rival managers			0
whatever happens , they will remember this night when they went toe to toe for 90 minutes of top - flight football			1
there was adrenaline , action , twists and turns			1
it was good to see two @entity17 coaches who have come up through the ranks against each other in a match of this importance			0
their teams ’ @entity23 statuses were not decided on tuesday night , but this felt like a sliding - doors moment that directed their paths			1
@entity0 and @entity1 embrace each other as they met at @entity30 on tuesday night there was adrenaline , action , twists and turns as @entity1 and @entity0 went head to head at @entity30 @entity36 led , then @entity37 led , then @entity38 gave @entity36 a taste of victory before @entity41 wiped it away with his hat - trick goal			1
it was absorbing stuff on the pitch as well as in the technical areas , where @entity0 and @entity1 stood			1
they shuffled and shouted , cajoled and pointed			0
never during the match did they exchange glances , perhaps too afraid to look the other in the eye and give the game away			0
@entity0 and @entity1 ’s relationship was forged over four years at @entity54			1
they helped bring through young talent ; @entity0 predominantly picking and motivating , @entity1 mainly coaching			1
@entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 are part of their @entity54 legacy			0
now @entity23 bosses , they still live 10 minutes apart in @entity64 and @entity65			1
they have been for pints this season and will do so again in the future no doubt , unpicking this game that had so much at stake			0
@entity0 tore his jacket off as he celebrated his team 's goal en route to @entity41 's hat - trick @entity0 throws his jacket as he celebrates the goal at @entity30 in the relegation battle @entity0 was out at pitchside much earlier than his friend and rival , so he waited and watched as @entity1 , jacket wrapped around his waist , strode out on his own from tunnel to dugout			1
the @entity37 boss extended his hand and there was a warm embrace between the two men as an arc of photographers snapped away nearby			2
@entity0 wore his customary gilet			2
in the seventh minute it was unzipped , three minutes later it was ripped off and flung to the floor			0
the timings coincided with @entity36 ’s opening goal , and @entity37 ’s equaliser			1
think @entity100 minus the hoarding kicks			0
@entity0 , as we have become accustomed , was living the match on the edge			2
unafraid to hype its importance before kick - off , he was treating it as such once the whistle blew			2
the showdown between @entity111 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) ended in a 3 - 3 draw at @entity30 by half - time we had seen the full show			1
in the 16th minute he placed his hands on his head when @entity36 keeper @entity117 saved from @entity118			2
in the 24th he hurried his players to take a free - kick			0
soon after he was telling fans behind his dugout to calm down after @entity123 delivered a poor corner			0
he produced his double - fisted pump celebration after @entity41 ’s second , the one we saw during the latter stages of the @entity128 win over @entity130			0
@entity0 was more restrained in the second period , particularly when @entity132 found a leveller			2
@entity38 ’s strike left him shellshocked before @entity41 put a smile back on his face			0
with six games to go , both men have much to think about .			0

@entity37 and @entity36 drew 3 - 3 in the @entity23 on tuesday night
@entity0 and @entity1 's *reunion* had twists and turns to it
the two *clubs* ' @entity23 statuses were not decided by the draw
