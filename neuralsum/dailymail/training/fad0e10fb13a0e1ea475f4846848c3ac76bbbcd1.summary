' @entity1 , who played college football with the @entity91 , was dragged into a racial controversy last week after a white sports columnist compared the tattooed player to residents of @entity96			2
it is the extensive body art of @entity1 - the quarterback for the @entity13 that has so upset sports columnist @entity99 @entity101 writer @entity100 penned an article where he bemoaned the amount of tattoos that 25 - year - old @entity1 had on his body			2

' you are categorizing this kid on something like tattoos ? really ? ' saying other guys are role models because they do n't have them ? really ? some of these other guys do n't have crystal clear reputations			0
that 's how you 're going to define this kid ? it 's pretty irritating is what it is			0
' @entity1 's father @entity48 said that @entity100 should have focused on his son 's charity work and not his body art. ' this guy has probably never talked to @entity1 , ' @entity48 said			1
' instead of saying that @entity1 does all these great things and donates his time to children , this guy is going to make him out like a gangster			0
' really ? i guess you just have to roll with the punches			0
' he added : ' somebody asked me if i got mad about that			0
i said no. it 's just a guy and his opinion			0
