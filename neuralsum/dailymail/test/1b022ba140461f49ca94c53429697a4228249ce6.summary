setting up costs : @entity7 asks for a ' donation ' of £ 1,500 from churches and community groups but the hefty bill has come under scrutiny following controversy over the false @entity7 claim that it fed more than a million hungry people last year			1
in fact , the one million figure was the number of food parcels handed out – so did not account for repeat visitors			0
