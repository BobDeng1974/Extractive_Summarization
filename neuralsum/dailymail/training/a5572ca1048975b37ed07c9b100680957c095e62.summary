by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 14:42 est , 14 march 2014 it takes professional athletes years of training and thousands of pounds worth of equipment to compete for a medal at the @entity7			1
but at this skiing event in @entity10 all you need is enthusiasm and a couple of planks of wood			2
the annual @entity15 , which takes place in @entity17 , near the capital @entity19 , is so low - tech there are n't even ski lifts , with competitors forced to hike three miles up a mountain before the event even begins			1
the fourth annual @entity15 took place in @entity17 , near @entity19 , at the beginning of march the race is open to both snowboarders and skiers , many of whom bring their own equipment the race is free for @entity10 who are encouraged to bring their own equipment but ' no weapons ' international skiers travel to take part in the race , but they must pay $ 500 ( £ 300 ) to enter @entity38 amateurs often strap tyre strips to a plank of wood to use as a ski , and compete wearing warm clothing dressed in jumpers , scarves and even loafers , the competitors carry their equipment up to roughly 3,400 metres ( 11,100ft ) before skiing back down			1
there is only one event , a downhill race everyone takes part in at the same time , with the winner being the first to cross the finish line after passing through all the checkpoints on the way down			2
the race is open to both skiers and snowboarders , with most competitors using whatever they can get their hands on			2
in recent years , many @entity10 nationals have shown their ingenuity by carving themselves skis and poles out of wood , using old planks or fence posts			1
the slopes are so low - tech that there are n't even chair lifts , with skiers hiking five miles before the race starts the annual event , in its fourth year , is organised by the @entity76 on the club 's website they warn that medical facilities are ' basic ' and there is no mountain rescue service any profit from the event is reinvested in tourism in @entity10 as the country emerges from conflict while the keen amateurs may grab the attention with their diy skis , the event was won by a professional @entity10 ski instructor they then use sandal straps , plastic and strips cut from old tyres to hold their feet in place before racing down the @entity99 - e - @entity98			1
@entity101 photographer @entity100 , 42 , who captured these images , said they would still put most people to shame			0
he said : ' it is absolutely amazing to watch these guys use the most basic items to ski			0
they use whatever they can get their hands on			0
' it is totally different to the @entity113 and the @entity114			0
the are no lifts , no chairs , this is raw skiing at its best			0
' despite the equipment , photographer @entity100 said the skiers would put most amateurs to shame the @entity122 , near to @entity19 , where the event takes place , has snow for four months a year @entity76 is part owned by skiing enthusiasts from @entity128 who are trying to promote the sport participants all race at once and the winner is the one who crosses the finish line first after passing through all of the checkpoints dotted along the route this year 's winner was @entity139 , an @entity10 ski instructor , who finished the 4k run before anyone else the event , now in its fourth year , featured 15 racers from @entity10 and 15 international competitors from the @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and the @entity101			1
foreign competitors must pay $ 500 ( £ 300 ) to take part , but for @entity10 nationals the competition is free			1
the challenge was eventually won by @entity10 ski instructor @entity139 - who used modern equipment and was used to the high - altitude conditions			2
mr @entity100 , from @entity158 , @entity159 , added : ' the area is covered in snow for three to four months and because the locals are used to the altitude they are really fit and hardly get tired around the course			0
' a simple piece of wood serves as a cheap , but not very effective alternative to carbon fibre bits of old shoes , spare plastic , foam and tyre rubber are all then used in place of conventional foot straps competitors from around the world take part in the race , using slightly more advanced equipment the event , which takes place in one of the safe @entity10 regions , draws a large crowd every year all money made by the race is put back into promoting the local skiing and tourism in @entity10 as the country emerges from a decade of war			1
while @entity76 , which organises the event , insists the area is safe from fighting , they do point out that the mountains do n't have any of the safety feature usually associated with ski resorts			0
there are no avalanche warning systems , no mobile phone signal , no mountain rescue service , and medical facilities are ' basic ' , their @entity201 page says			0
they say that the competition is strictly ' no weapons ' , adding that ' all participants take part solely at their own risk '			0

@entity15 happens every march in @entity17 , near @entity19
competitors come from all over the world to take part
it is free to compete for @entity10 , who often bring their own equipment
@entity222 planks complete with tyre strips serve as *makeshift* skis
