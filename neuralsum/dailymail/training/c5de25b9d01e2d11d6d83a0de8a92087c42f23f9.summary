at the time his agent insisted that the footballer , who has repeatedly denied having a gambling problem , was simply taking advantage of a generous rate of interest to fund other property deals			2
the value of @entity3 's property will have risen since he first bought it , but he still has an incredibly large mortgage for someone earning more than half a million pounds a month			1
a source told @entity8 : ' it is very unusual behaviour for someone earning significantly more than half a million pounds a month			1
' based on current premium account rates , the monthly repayments on @entity3 's own home loan are likely to be about £ 13,500			0

the charge relates to a penalty box clash with @entity58 at @entity59 's @entity74 in october in which he is accused of calling @entity58 a ‘ f * * * * * * black * * * * ’			1
@entity3 , who denies any racial abuse , said after the match that he told @entity58 , whose brother @entity79 plays alongside him for @entity20 , that the remarks had been taken out of context , insisting he actually said : ‘ @entity83 , @entity58 , do you think i called you a black * * * * ? ’ however , prosecutors decided there was enough evidence , including tv images of the incident that were beamed around the world , to charge him			1
the @entity8 also reported that @entity3 remortgaged his mother - in - law 's home in a move apparently to generate cash to build a vast luxury estate from scratch			0
he bought @entity95 her mansion next door to his own for a reported £ 3.15million in august 2007 , but remortgaged on june 7 last year - the same day he remortgaged his place for the fourth time , @entity8 reports			0
