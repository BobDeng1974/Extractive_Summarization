those who claim they are following their diets ' religiously ' are not only being figurative about their diligence			1
@entity4 , who describes himself as an endurance sports writer , coach and nutritionist , makes the interesting point in this book that each and every weight - loss fad - the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity11 , @entity14 , among many others - embodies core elements of a sacred sect , with followers and disciples , converts and renegades			1
@entity21 , my own cult of choice , even meets in a church hall - and we , the stout , enjoy the camaraderie , the fellowship , and shout hallelujah when a pound is shed			1
( two stone in my case - i 'm heading for canonisation			1
) @entity35 harvest : but it 's a myth the @entity38 's longevity is all down to the oil according to the book diets do n't appeal to reason as such - like religion , they operate on the emotions , for which some kind of structure is nevertheless required and is why i call my @entity50 ' handbook my bible			1
@entity4 says that people fear being on their own , and assume that it is impossible to attain maximum health without joining a diet cult			1
and in their own turn , religions are keen on gastronomic rules and regulations : there are 613 rules of correct living for @entity63 in the @entity64 , for example			1
@entity66 have halal methods of slaughter			1
@entity69 is based around the rituals of dining - suppers , wedding parties , parables about crops and vineyards			1
one of philosophy 's great puzzles is the connection between the soul and the body - fleshly impulses versus spiritual feelings			1
people want to feel purified , and vegetarians and vegans see the body as in imminent danger of rotting and fermenting from too much protein , which is ' clogging up the vision , clogging up the lymphatic system '			1
while this very well may be so , i am the son of a @entity93 butcher			1
vegetarianism holds all the appeal for me of the @entity96			1
in evolutionary terms , we have not done very well with our diets			1
missing out : some ' diet cults ' will only eat raw food when the apes dropped from the trees , where they 'd subsisted on fruit and insects , and began to hunt on the grassy plains , assuming an upright posture and opposable thumbs the better to capture , kill and market ( i presume ) woolly mammoths , in two shakes of a lamb 's tail , complex societies existed and everyone was obese , lolling on sofas all afternoon in front of the telly , guzzling on snacks and crisps from vending machines , cheeseburgers and beer			1
though such a scenario is convincing , the cavemen were probably thin because they had to keep running away from sabre tooth tigers			1
nevertheless , there are now cults in @entity131 that wo n't eat bread because people did n't 8,000 years ago			1
they wo n't cook , because ' cooking destroys vital nutrients in food '			1
frying aside , cooking increases the amount of energy the body can extract from what it ingests			2
as @entity4 says , ' cooking made us human '			1
there is a religious sense of asceticism or mortification behind diets - the notion that being lardy involves a sense of sin and shame			2
we all know people who will never admit to being greedy			2
instead they say with a straight face they are big - boned or have a slow metabolism			2
as @entity4 says , if people are blobby , it is because they ca n't sustain the self - discipline necessary to keep fit in the modern age			1
' just one burger wo n’t kill me ! ' is the fatal line of thought - a demonic temptation			2
if , in the 19th century , no fewer than ten dishes were served at a typical gathering in grand homes , people did n't immediately collapse because they were simply more active - walking or riding , marching and colonising @entity173			2
our contemporary equivalents are athletes , who eat eggs and pasta by the bucket , yet remain slender because they swim six hours a day , lift weights , run for miles - ' and if the furnace is hot enough , everything burns '			2
whose furnace today is switched on , let alone up high ? were we to go back in time , we 'd never adjust to the cuisine , in the same way that @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 are destroyed by any abrupt switch to the modern @entity193 diet			1
our ancestors were enterprisingly carnivorous in ways alien to us now			2
explorers in the @entity197 dined off badger , beaver , bear , cormorant , otter , porcupine and wolf			2
meat was the most concentrated source of energy available - and what a lot of big girl 's blouses people are today with their gluten and lactose intolerances , or those maniacs you hear about who rinse cottage cheese to reduce its fat content			2
not the enemy : @entity14 demonised the potato but it has numerous health benefits one problem for the early settlers in the @entity224 was they ' survived almost entirely on elk meat			2
the monotony nearly drove them crazy			0
' as @entity229 said , man can not live by bread alone - or in my case , stew			0
@entity234 was the only thing my mother wished to cook , @entity237 bless her			0
a cauldron bubbled on the stove for decades , into which was tossed any old scrap or gritty carrot			0
indeed , when @entity244 heard about my mother 's stew , he wrote macbeth			0
but it did n't kill me , did it ? it 's the modish low - fat , high - carb , or high - fat , low - carb , or liquid diets based on pricey weight - loss supplements that you have to watch			0
the orthodoxy is always altering			0
@entity14 , for example , demonised the potato as the most calorifically productive crop on earth , with the result there was an 8 per cent drop in demand worldwide , even in @entity265 , where it had been a staple			0
there were notorious famines in 1845 and 1852 when the crop failed and everyone had to emigrate to @entity269 and drink @entity270 instead			0
yet , in 2011 , a researcher decided to eat nothing but spuds for 60 days straight			0
he lost 21lb , his cholesterol dropped to healthy levels , and his wife said he stopped snoring			0
result : knickers to @entity14			0
what is gospel one minute is heresy the next			0
sugar , creamy milk and red meat are now carcinogenic evils			0
coffee , which we were advised to cut down on , is now , according to the @entity289 , an elixir : ' habitual coffee drinkers were up to 40 per cent less likely to kill themselves			0
' bars of chocolate are also back on the menu , as cocoa ' has a favourable effect on blood platelet formation and reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes '			0
does that mean i do n't have to feel guilty about @entity304 ? if the voices from the pulpit now agree that a little bit of what you fancy does you good , and that the purpose of a diet is to enable higher energy levels and improved mood states and mental health , then the answer is yes			1
and as any @entity317 always knew , plump people are jollier than sour - looking skinny people			0
but if you do n’t really want to be a fat pig , only exercise will stimulate major weight loss - though no blinking way will you find me watching workout videos			0
the best method of all , of course , is not to eat a thing - hence the religious notion of fasting , which the devout go in for to practise humility and self - control			0
but it amused me to learn that though for years people thought their splendid olive oil was the reason why @entity38 seldom died of heart disease , it has now been worked out their longevity is related to the fact that in the @entity341 there are no less than 180 fasting days each year			0
so extra virgin olive oil , imported by @entity343 by the gallon , has nothing to do with it			0
my theory , however , is that @entity38 are in tip - top shape because of all that plate smashing .			0
