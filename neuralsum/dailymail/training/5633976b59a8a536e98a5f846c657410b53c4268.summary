nearly 180,000 claimed to be followers of the @entity67 religion featured in star wars - down from 2001 , when around 400,000 jokingly put the faith down on their census form			2
the statistics emerged as the archbishop of @entity74 claimed that @entity76 cathedral congregations had grown dramatically in recent years , debunking the ' clich√© ' that the @entity78 is fading away			0
@entity79 , chief executive of the @entity80 , said the decline in religion was ' really significant ' , adding : ' in spite of a biased question that positively encourages religious responses , to see such an increase in the non-religious and such a decrease in those reporting themselves as @entity22 is astounding			2
' of course these figures still exaggerate the number of @entity22 overall - the number of believing , practising @entity22 is much lower than this and the number of those leading their lives with no reference to religion much higher			1
' but @entity100 , research director at theology think - tank @entity101 , argued ' religion is difficult to define and difficult to measure			2
' the census measures religious identification , not beliefs or practice			0
it 's about what people call themselves , and which group they wish to identify with			2
' these figures show that we have a plural religious landscape , but that does n't mean we 're atheists			0
digging deeper , we see that even those who say they have no religion often have a variety of spiritual beliefs , but they do n't want to associate these to religious institutions			0
' religion : this graph shows how @entity125 has been in decline as every other faith grows more popular change : the number of ' @entity12 ' people is at an all - time low following a decade of change the data on religion showed considerable national variation - @entity133 , in @entity135 , is the most @entity22 town in @entity8 with 80.9 per cent of residents following the faith , while in @entity4 's @entity139 34.5 per cent of the population are @entity55			1
@entity141 is the most godless place in the country , as 42.5 per cent said they had no religion - despite the presence of one of @entity8 's most spectacular cathedrals			1

@entity4 is also home to the most immigrants , as 37 per cent of its residents were born abroad and 24 per cent are not citizens of the @entity2			2
one major reason for the explosion in the foreign - born population is the accession of 12 countries in central and eastern @entity170 to the @entity171 , giving them the right to live and work in the @entity2 - the population of @entity176 in @entity8 and @entity9 has grown nine-fold over the decade			1
