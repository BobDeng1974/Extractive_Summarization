by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:23 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 07:49 est , 9 march 2014 dealing with @entity5 ’s debts must not be done solely through attacks on public pending and welfare , the @entity3 said today			1
in a swipe at the @entity12 , chief secretary to the treasury @entity9 said ‘ there is such a thing as society ’ as he warned the wealthiest must be made to pay their fair share			1
he also used a speech to the @entity3 conference in @entity20 to dismiss ‘ feeble ’ @entity22 attempts to claim the income tax cut as their own policy , and signalled people who earn up to £ 12,500 should pay no income tax at all			1
chief secretary to the treasury @entity9 warned the @entity12 against balancing the books through spending cuts alone mr @entity9 told the @entity3 spring conference in @entity20 that tax rises on the rich were also needed @entity22 chancellor @entity32 has said that another £ 25billion must be found after the election , which he wants to raise from cuts to housing benefit for young people and removing council houses from wealthy tenants			1
but mr @entity9 rejected the idea , insisting tax rises on the richest should also be used to balance the books			1
he told delegates : ‘ there is still much to do in this @entity44 and the next to pay down the deficit and secure the recovery			0
this must be done fairly			0
‘ and here ’s where i have news for those on the right – there is such a thing as society			2
‘ we can not and will not rely only on cutting public spending and targeting welfare to finish the job			2
‘ that ’s why we are committed to ensuring that the wealthiest pay their fair share			0
mr @entity9 warned the @entity12 ' there is such a thing as society ' ‘ we will find a way forward that underpins a stronger economy and delivers a fairer society			1
’ he warned that even with forecasts projecting the government running a surplus by 2018 , ‘ we will still have work to do to get our national debt burden down to safe levels ’			0
‘ it would not be fair to leave that to our children , ’ he added			0
‘ but we @entity3 will also ensure that the state has the resources to fund the public services and infrastructure investment that our country needs			2
‘ and we will insist that the wealthiest make a proper contribution			0
’ mr @entity9 also made clear that raising the personal income tax allowance to £ 12,500 will be a key @entity3 demand in any coalition talks after the 2015 election			1
in 2010 the @entity3 promised to increase the threshold to £ 10,000 , which it will reach in april this year			1
the @entity89 next month is expected to include a further £ 500 rise , which will come into effect next week , weeks before the general election			2
mr @entity9 said : ‘ we will fight the next election with our own ideas , our own policies , our own values - no one else 's			2
‘ and i can tell you that a top priority in any negotiation will be our aspiration to raise the personal allowance dramatically again in the next @entity44			2
‘ to raise it to £ 12,500 ... that would be a further tax cut for working people of £ 500			1
‘ at our first fiscal event in the next @entity44 , we would deliver another tax cut of at least £ 100			2
‘ a two term @entity3 government would then be delivering a tax cut for working people of £ 1200 - that 's £ 100 a month			1
’ @entity3 leader @entity112 applauds mr @entity9 's speech in the conference hall of the @entity115 he claimed the rise in the tax allowance was ‘ forced through ’ in the face of opposition from the @entity22 wing of the coalition. , but the @entity118 were now trying to take the credit for the policy			1
‘ we have had to fight for this at every budget and at every @entity127 since 2010			0
‘ and what a fight it has been			0
it started in those election debates when the @entity118 said ' we can not afford it '			0
‘ in 2010 the @entity118 wanted inheritance tax cuts for millionaires , we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people			0
‘ in 2011 the @entity118 wanted ' shares for rights ' , we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people			0
‘ in 2013 the @entity118 wanted a tax break for married couples that excluded millions of families , we fought for and delivered - you guessed it - more tax cuts for working people			0
‘ now , belatedly , some @entity12 are lamely trying to claim credit			0
‘ do n't get me wrong , it must be hard to be a @entity22 in a @entity145 delivering so much @entity3 policy , so it 's no surprise if some of them have gone native			1
