@entity0 could n't help but fire a parting shot at his @entity3 rivals , even as he withdrew from the presidential race and backed front - runner @entity5 monday morning			1
' this race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the @entity11 people and not worthy of this critical time , ' he said during an announcement in @entity14 , @entity15			1
@entity0 , a former @entity16 governor and the president @entity18 's ambassador to @entity19 , must now navigate the tricky waters of supporting a candidate he slammed as an unelectable , untrustworthy flip - flopper			1
shortly after @entity0 told his staff sunday night he was planning to quit the presidential race , videos and statements criticizing the former @entity28 governor disappeared from @entity0 's campaign website			1
family affair : four of @entity0 's daughters , including his adopted @entity33 daughter @entity32 , stood on stage with him and his wife @entity35 ( in the purple ) today exit : @entity0 leaves the stage after his announcement this morning , flanked by his daughter @entity39 ( left ) and his wife @entity35 ( right ) bowing out : @entity0 's presidential bid never gained traction and floundered after a disappointing performance in @entity44 as an opponent , @entity0 was one of @entity5 's harshest critics , offering several devastating assessments of the front - runner in an attempt to win over @entity5 's moderate supporters			1
' i will always put my country first			0
it seems that @entity54 believes in putting politics first			0
gov @entity5 enjoys firing people ; i enjoy creating jobs			1
it may be that he ’s slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in @entity11 right now , and that ’s a dangerous place to be , ' he told reporters right before the @entity44 primary			0
lest anyone forget @entity0 's harsh words , the @entity64 produced a greatest hits list of the most cutting remarks by the former candidate			2
@entity70 gains : hours after the announcement , @entity5 thanked @entity0 for his support and praised his campaign plea for unity : flanked by his family , @entity0 criticized the divisive tone of the @entity3 race and said the party needs to unite and @entity0 's endorsement of @entity5 was no ringing embrace			1
instead , he simply cited @entity5 's electability			2
@entity0 's campaign pulled down statements critical of @entity5 as he moved to endorse the @entity3 front - runner			1
however , the @entity64 wo n't let @entity0 forget what he said			2
it has released a list of his greatest @entity87 : ' i believe it is now time for our party to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat @entity18			0
despite our differences i believe that candidate is gov @entity5 , ' @entity0 said at a news conference with his wife and children			1
@entity0 staked his presidential bid on making a name for himself in last week 's @entity44 primary			2
but his candidacy never really gained traction and he came in a disappointing third place behind @entity5 and @entity107 rep @entity105			2
campaign sources said @entity0 was dropping out now because he did n't want to pull support away from @entity5 , which could prolong the @entity3 presidential primary			1
@entity5 gladly accepted the affirmation from his fellow @entity112			2
' i salute @entity0 & his wife @entity35			2
he ran a campaign based on unity not division , & love of country			0
i appreciate his support , ' the candidate tweeted moments after the public announcement			0
despite his low support from voters , @entity0 's departure will surely be a boon to @entity5			1
he was only polling at three to five percent in @entity15 and @entity127 , the next two primary states , but he was the only candidate still competing for moderate voters who are the backbone of @entity5 's support			1
according to recent polls , nearly all of @entity0 's supporters said @entity5 was their second choice			1
this further consolidates the establishment wing of the @entity3			0
conservative voters are still divided between former @entity140 senator @entity139 , former house speaker @entity141 and , to a lesser extent , @entity107 gov @entity143			0
@entity0 is the third candidate to leave the race			1
former @entity148 gov @entity146 exited in august and @entity148 rep @entity149 dropped out after a poor showing in the @entity153 caucus			0
by his side : @entity0 made the announcement in @entity15 with his family , including his wife @entity35 waving farewell : @entity0 said he was ending his presidential bid because he believes @entity5 is the best choice to beat president @entity18 despite strong credentials -- an attractive , highly - educated former governor and businessman who speaks @entity33 and has extensive foreign policy experience -- @entity0 never rose above single digits in national polls			1
he staked his campaign on a victory , or at least a strong showing , in moderate @entity44			0
but the granite state did n't show him the love he was hoping for			0
he received just 17 percent of the vote compared to @entity5 's dominant 39 percent			0
@entity105 came in second with 23 percent			0
@entity175 gov @entity174 turned down a @entity3 movement urging him to run for president this year , but he has n't ruled out the possibility in the future			1
he told @entity180 during her visit to his home in @entity183 , @entity175 , that he was considering running in 2016			2
' i 'll be much more ready for it four years from now than i am now , ' he said			0
@entity174 says he can see his family occupying the @entity187 in the future			0
the 49 - year - old former @entity11 attorney told @entity180 he and his wife seriously considered the calls to run for president against @entity18 , but ultimately he felt comfortable turning them down			2
' inside me it never felt right			0
i knew that if it did n't feel right , i could n't be me , ' he said .			0
