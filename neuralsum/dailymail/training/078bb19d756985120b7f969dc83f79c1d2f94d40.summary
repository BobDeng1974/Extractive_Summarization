if you ’ve suffered from a blocked nose and sinus pain , the chances are that you ’ll have reached for a decongestant			2
but you may not know how the remedy relieves the annoying symptoms			0
now , a chemistry teacher from @entity9 has created an infographic to explain just how the medicine , which typically comes in spray or tablet form , stops the nose from running			2
chemistry @entity15 created an infographic ( pictured ) to explain how decongestants work			1
they targetalpha - adrenergic receptors in the nose and sinuses to constrict blood vessels , which helps to reduce inflammation and the formation of mucus @entity15 explained in a post on his blog , @entity27 that decongestants work by targeting alpha - adrenergic receptors in the nose and sinuses to constrict blood vessels , which helps to reduce inflammation and the formation of mucus			1
while a number of drugs can be used to create the effect , some of the most common are pseudoephedrine , oxymetazoline - which can also be used to treat nosebleeds - phenylephrine and xylometazoline			1
pseudoephedrine , a natural compound found in plants , is one of the most effective decongestants and is produced on a large scale by using a mixture of yeast , dextrose – grape sugar - and benzaldehyde , which is a colourless liquid with many industrial uses			1
as well as acting on alpha - adrenergic receptors , pseudoephedrine also targets other receptors , which relax muscles in the airways to ease congestion			1
research has shown that man flu is n't a myth , because a lack of female sex hormones actually leaves males with weaker immune systems			0
scientists from @entity66 said in october that a lack of oestrogen makes men more likely to succumb to pneumonia and other respiratory diseases			0
their study , published in medical journal @entity74 tested the effect of bacterial pneumonia on mice by introducing the infection to their lungs			0
professor @entity80 , of the university 's @entity81 , found females were naturally more resistant to the condition			0
their increased resistance was linked to the enzyme nitric oxide synthase 3 ( @entity87 ) - activated by the release of the female sex hormone oestrogen			0
by administering a simple dose of oestrogen to both males and females , they were able to cure both of serious lung infections - clearing the bacteria from their lungs far more rapidly than normal mice			0
the team hopes that , in the future , this knowledge could be used to enhance resistance to common and serious lung infections and prevent flu developing into more serious pneumonia			0
professor @entity80 said : ' ultimately , this work could be especially useful in reducing risk of secondary bacterial pneumonias during seasonal or pandemic influenza			0
' we were quite pleased that the work led us to nos3 - targeting drugs that are already available and that can indeed improve resistance to pneumonia in our mouse model			2
' as well as acting on alpha - adrenergic receptors , pseudoephedrine also targets other receptors , which relax smooth muscle in the airways to ease congestion ( illustrated in this stock image ) but using the decongestant for too long can backfire while pseudoephedrine is an ingredient in may over-the - counter medicines , there are other active ingredients			1
@entity131 is one such alternative , but a handful of studies have claimed it is no more effective in easing nasal congestion than a placebo			2
@entity138 , on the other hand , is on the @entity140 ’s list of essential medicines , but is n’t advised for people with high blood pressure			0
@entity144 can also be used in the treatment of nosebleeds and eye redness			0
while nasal decongestants may be effective in relieving the symptoms of a cold in the short term , they can only be used for a limited amount of time			1
‘ for the most part , use of nasal sprays for more than a few days can induce rhinitis medicamentosa , more commonly referred to as rebound congestion , ’ mr @entity15 writes			1
scientists are unsure exactly why this happens , but it means that people who overuse their nasal sprays can trigger a vicious circle of mucus			1
‘ more of the decongestant is taken to alleviate the congestion , and the rebound congestion continues , ’ he explained			1
it seems that the problem of rebound congestion can be avoided by taking tablets instead .			2

chemistry @entity15 created his *inforgraphic* to *detail* the different chemical types of decongestants
they work by by targeting alpha - adrenergic receptors in the nose and sinuses to constrict blood vessels , which helps to reduce inflammation and the formation of mucus - easing the symptoms of a cold
the most common *decongestatnts* are : pseudoephedrine , oxymetazoline phenylephrine and xylometazoline
effective in relieving the symptoms of a cold in the short term , they can only be used for a limited amount of time
this is because they can trigger a vicious circle of mucus - rhinitis medicamentosa or rebound congestion
