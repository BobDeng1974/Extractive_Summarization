its hull astonishingly intact , a @entity0 lies embedded in remote mudflats up an @entity3 more than 40 of the deadly submarines met their fate in our waters during the conflict , this is the only one that can be seen			1
the wreckage of the others lies hidden deep beneath the sea			0
the existence of this one has long been known , but its eerie presence has gained fresh interest after tidal changes and the recent storms made it more visible			0
a @entity18 , believed @entity19 , on mudflats near @entity21 near the @entity22 the u-boats of the @entity24 very nearly won @entity25 for @entity26 all that is left of the once deadly weapon is a crumbling rusted wreck of the submarine the wreckage can still be seen beached in a remote area of mudflats on the banks of the @entity35 in @entity36 new research by naval historians for @entity39 has shed fresh light on how the undersea war machine came to be marooned on the banks of the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity43 , and the mystery of why it has lain there untouched for more than nine decades			1
their investigations also led them to conclude that , after many years of uncertainty about its identity , it is almost certainly a submarine called @entity53 - 122			1
yesterday marine archaeologist @entity54 , the maritime designation adviser for @entity39 , said : ‘ it has been there since 1921			0
it was one of more than 100 u-boats which surrendered at the end of the war and were taken to @entity61			0
‘ some were sent to the @entity63 navy but most were cut up and used as scrap metal			1
‘ records show that the diesel engines were cut out of @entity67 and reused in a cement works at @entity69 in @entity43 – the u-boat ’s power plants thus serviced @entity73 ’s post-war industrial development			1
‘ what we still do n’t know is exactly why or how @entity76 ended where it is			2
it ’s likely it was being taken up the @entity35 estuary to be broken up for scrap			1
perhaps in a storm it parted from its tow , the cable snapped , and the prevailing winds blew it to @entity36			2
‘ as to why it was left there , we can only speculate			0
it could have been too much of an effort to get to it , or perhaps it was a problem of navigation in how to get to it			0
‘ its interest is that it is the only known complete u-boat that can be seen in @entity73 tidal waters			1
’ @entity67 - 122 was a ‘ coastal ’ u-boat equipped with ten torpedoes and designed to attack @entity101 shipping			2
the other main use of @entity103 was for laying mines			0
there are no current plans to conserve it , but @entity39 is ‘ looking to identify its historic place in more detail ’ after the end of next year ’s commemorations associated with the centenary of the start of the 1914 to 1918 war			0
mr @entity54 said : ‘ it still serves as a poignant reminder of those who gave their lives at sea during the @entity25			2
’ the submarine is thought to be a @entity53 - @entity123 submarine and would have carried 10 torpedoes and were usually armed with a deck gun they carried a crew of 34 and had a cruising range of 7,200 - 9,000 miles			1
between 1916 and 1918 , 96 were built the u-boats of the @entity24 very nearly won the @entity25 for @entity26 after the country heavily invested in the vessels the u-boat skippers would target @entity73 vessels on 5th september 1914 , the @entity134 21 , which was considered unpromising initially , sank the @entity73 light cruiser @entity136			1
in february 1915 the sea around the @entity73 isles were declared a war zone by @entity26 and the battle of the u-boats began			1
a neutral flag offered no protection against the ruthless @entity103 captains , who were ordered to be absolutely sure a ship was neutral before sparing it			0
submarines did not have a hopeful start in their history			0
the first submarine built in @entity26 was called the @entity151 , which sank during its first test dive			2
but bigger and more successful submarines were developed , and equipped with deadly weapons which made them a crucial addition to @entity26 's arsenal of weapons			0
at the start of @entity25 , @entity26 had twenty - nine u-boats ; in the first ten weeks , five @entity73 cruisers had been lost to them			1
on 5 september 1914 , @entity136 was sunk by @entity163 21 , the first ship to have been sunk by a submarine using a self - propelled torpedo			0
u-boats caused so much destruction that at one point during @entity171 the @entity73 government thought that @entity73 would have to contemplate surrendering			2
following the end of @entity25 , @entity26 was technically not allowed to have submarines or submarine crews - but continued to invest money , time and man power into building more as they prepared for @entity171 .			1

it is the only @entity26 submarine visible in @entity73 waters today and is a visible reminder of the @entity25
the submarine is thought to be a @entity53 - @entity123 submarine and would have carried 10 torpedoes
after the war the @entity26 @entity76 was initially *stripped* of its internal metal engines to be used for scrap metal
the wreckage can still be seen beached in a remote area of mudflats on the banks of the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity43
