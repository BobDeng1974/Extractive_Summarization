who will be flying the military aircraft of tomorrow ? according to the @entity3 , it may partially fall in the hands of artificial intelligence ( @entity6 )			1
reports say that both the @entity8 and @entity9 are planning next - generation fighters that do n't have just a human pilot			1
future fighter jets may have an @entity6 co-pilot on board that can help with sensory data in addition to autonomously landing the plane on an aircraft carrier			1
scroll down to watch an autonomous aircraft dodge a missile the @entity3 in @entity21 is planning to introduce artificial intelligence to a future generation of fighter jets			1
the plan it to use @entity6 as co-pilots to humans and possibly to help landing on an aircraft carrier			1
such technology may be used in the @entity8 's upcoming @entity30 ( artist 's concept shown ) according to the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , artificial intelligence will feature prominently on the successors to the @entity36 and the @entity37			1
a human - like ‘ skin ’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘ feel ’ the world around them - is being developed by @entity47 experts			0
engineers at @entity49 ’ @entity50 are investigating a ‘ smart skin ’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors			0
when applied to an aircraft , it will enable it to sense wind speed , temperature , physical strain and movement , far more accurately than current sensor technology allows			0
the revolutionary ‘ smart skin ’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health , reporting back on potential problems before they become significant			0
the @entity8 is working on the @entity30 and the @entity9 on the @entity68 , with both designed to replace their predecessors by 2030 at the earliest			1
‘ @entity6 is going to be huge , ’ a @entity8 official told the @entity34			0
while the exact purpose of @entity6 in aircraft is n’t known yet , it could have a number of uses from acting as a co-pilot to carrying out autonomous landings			0
according to @entity79 the robotic co-pilots would be especially helpful for aircraft carriers , which are difficult to land on			2
recently the @entity8 ’s @entity82 experimental drone landed autonomously on an aircraft , demonstrating the usefulness of @entity6 in such a situation			2
@entity6 could also help with something known as advanced sensor fusion			0
this involves combining data from various sensors to get a more accurate reading of a situation or location			0
the @entity8 and @entity9 are also hoping to get help from industry experts in @entity96 to aid them in the design of such sixth - generation fighters			2
according to the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , artificial intelligence will feature prominently on the successors to the @entity36 and the @entity37			2

the plan is to use @entity6 as co-pilots to humans and to help with sensory data and possibly with landings on aircraft carriers
such technology may be used in the @entity8 's upcoming @entity30 jet
and it may also feature in the @entity9 's @entity120 fighter jet
both are being designed to enter operation by 2030 at the earliest
