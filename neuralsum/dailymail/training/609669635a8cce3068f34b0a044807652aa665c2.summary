by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 published : 05:37 est , 27 february 2014 @entity5 : 19:03 est , 27 february 2014 @entity6 taunted the prime minister yesterday by saying the government ’s failure to control immigration was a ‘ good thing ’			0
the @entity12 were dealt a huge blow by new figures showing net migration to @entity16 had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to september 2013			1
it was driven entirely by a 40 per cent leap in the number of people taking advantage of @entity22 edicts on free movement			2
@entity25 immigration minister @entity24 insisted the government could not control immigration from within the @entity22 , but @entity28 business secretary @entity6 said rising immigration was ' good news ' the shock increase left @entity32 unable to say if @entity33 would meet his key election promise to slash net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by 2015			1
and his opponents on the @entity38 both declared his flagship policy in ‘ tatters ’			0
but , in remarks apparently calculated to infuriate his coalition colleagues , mr @entity6 declared the figures were a cause for celebration			0
the @entity28 business secretary said : ‘ actually , those figures are good news because the reason net immigration is going up is because fewer @entity16 people are emigrating and surely that ’s a good thing – people are getting jobs here			1
‘ we are getting people coming in from @entity55 to fill jobs in our expanding labour market , but the key point is that nine out of every ten new jobs that are being created are going to @entity16 workers			2
' this is further proof that any quota on migration , such as the one conservatives are pushing to get net migration down to tens of thousands , is unworkable and contradicts our aims of getting @entity16 back on its feet			1
’ prime minister @entity33 promised to cut net migration to the ' tens of thousands ' but that aim is now a long way off running salt into @entity25 wounds , he added : ‘ any target on migration is totally impractical , can not be delivered and would do great damage to the economy			1
’ mr @entity6 has fought long - running battles with @entity25 ministers over immigration controls and is likely to view the figures as a personal victory			0
hailing the rise as a success twists the knife into mr @entity33 , because mr @entity6 knows that missing the cherished target will infuriate backbench @entity25 mps and voters			0
@entity89 and @entity90 both said mr @entity33 ’s pledge was nothing more than ‘ smoke and mirrors ’ since @entity22 free movement rules rendered @entity16 powerless to stop workers flooding in from the continent			2
there could be even worse news to follow later this year when more up - to - date figures are @entity101 ’s statistics pre-date the controversial lifting of border controls on @entity104 and @entity105 on january 1			1
some 24,000 citizens of @entity104 and @entity105 arrived in the year to september 2013 – nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the previous year			1
ministers tried to present the figures as an economic success story as migrants fled the turmoil in the eurozone for @entity16 ’s stable jobs market			2
while migrants from @entity117 continue to top the list , there was a leap in arrivals from @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , where youth unemployment is at record levels			0
there was also a jump of 25 per cent in @entity129 numbers handed out to citizens of @entity131 , and the number given to @entity133 increased by 10 per cent , to 11,500			2
the @entity12 were dealt a huge blow by new figures showing net migration to @entity16 had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to september 2013 overall , 532,000 people immigrated to the @entity16 in the year ending september , up from the 497,000 people in the previous 12 months			1
some 320,000 emigrants left the country , down from the 343,000 the previous year			1
but it was a surge in @entity22 citizens arriving in the @entity16 that has driven the overall increase , rising to 209,000 from 149,000 the previous year , the @entity141 said			1
some 65,000 citizens of so - called @entity147 countries , that is pre- 2004 members of the union , arrived to work in the @entity16 , an increase of 23,000 when compared to the previous year			1
immigration of @entity154 citizens – who need a visa from the @entity156 – fell to 244,000 , down from 269,000 the previous year			0
statisticians said this was due to fewer new @entity160 citizens – such as those from @entity162 – migrating to the @entity16 for formal study			2
@entity164 , of business group @entity165 , said it was ‘ game over ’ for mr @entity33 ’s migration target			0
@entity89 leader @entity169 said : ‘ it is utterly pointless setting immigration targets when you ca n’t even decide who comes into this country			0
‘ until we end the open - door immigration policy with the @entity22 and take back full control over our borders , nothing can really be done			0
it ’s all smoke and mirrors			0
’ shadow home secretary @entity181 added : ‘ these figures show the government ’s net migration target is in tatters , and their immigration policy is a mess			1
’ @entity32 insisted the @entity184 was ‘ absolutely ’ committed to its target to reduce net migration to tens of thousands by 2015			1
but no 10 dodged questions about whether mr @entity33 was confident that would happen			0
his official spokesman said : ‘ we are putting in place what we believe are the right measures that go towards meeting that objective			0
’ immigration minister @entity24 said : ‘ uncontrolled , mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion , puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes			0
‘ our reforms have cut @entity154 migration to its lowest level since 1998 and there are now 82,000 fewer people arriving annually from outside the @entity22 than when this government came to power .			2

532,000 people arrived in @entity16 in year to september , up from 497,000
320,000 left the @entity16 , down from 343,000 a year earlier , @entity141 says
number of @entity104 and @entity105 arriving almost *trebles* to 24,000
tories promised to cut net migration to less than *100,000* by 2015
