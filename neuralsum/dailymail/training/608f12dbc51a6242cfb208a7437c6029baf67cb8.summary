after the identity of @entity6 was finally revealed , disturbing links between the former @entity2 student and other known extremists across the @entity4 and abroad have emerged			1
the 26 - year - old , who fled his family in west @entity2 to join extremists in @entity10 in 2012 , has been named as the executioner of @entity4 @entity12 and @entity13			1

but as it 's revealed the man was picked up by authorities trying to enter @entity51 in 2009 , more chilling links between @entity45 and a @entity2 underworld of terrorist activity have emerged			1
the most concerning are @entity29 's connections to a hub of fanatics reportedly known to the authorities as ' the @entity56 '			2
alongside a handful of others he was named in 2011 court documents in which the group is described as ' members of a network of @entity4 and @entity64 based @entity66 extremists '			1

â€˜ i did not know him , he would have been two years behind me , but i am utterly unsurprised			0
' @entity36 was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006 , and just days before @entity29 's identity was revealed , thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak			1
students previously expressed fears over the election of a former student union president and vice president alleged to have been connected to the group @entity170			0
@entity171 and @entity172 were elected in 2011 after sharing their support of the pro-islamic state group online			0
neither former student has responded to @entity177 's request for comment			0
since news of @entity182 's connection with @entity183 in @entity10 broke , the university 's @entity154 has distanced itself from having any involvement			2
