the appliance of science behind @entity4 ’s @entity3 reign was there for all to see on sunday afternoon			1
any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as @entity11 ’s resistance			1
despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding , frustrating 90 minutes against @entity13 three days previously – and the associated , sleep - disturbing travelling – @entity4 ’s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4 - 0 victory			1
it was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus			1
the @entity22 ’s insistence that @entity3 could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure			1
it was interpreted – or perhaps misinterpreted – as a slight on predecessor @entity29			2
@entity4 's @entity3 side are starting to become formidable under the @entity22 's reign at @entity32 but this much is clear			1
@entity4 has unquestionably made the @entity32 side more formidable in that regard			1
and he has all the stats to back it up			2
including one which earned recent arrival @entity40 a rapid ( in more ways than one ) gold star			1
crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of @entity4 ’s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players ’ performances			2
to the 39 - year - old , these reams of figures produced by the technology at @entity3 ’s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion			1
the hope is that it leads to better decisions			2
again , there would have been a few from the football old - school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk			2
but what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers			2
@entity4 ( centre ) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics ‘ i think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ there are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results , but i think we have had six victories after coming home from @entity88 games			1
you do n’t see that around the other @entity88 leagues			2
@entity13 lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back — so we did well to win in that way			2
‘ the amount of metres and sprints on sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before			2
we have increased the high - intensity running by 30 - 40 percent since the summer			2
@entity40 ( right ) ran an impressive 1300 metres against @entity11 on sunday ‘ we want to be direct , we want to create things , we want to have penetration , we want to be a high - pressing team , so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform			1
’ asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables , @entity4 broke into a grin			0
‘ i know everything about the players , ’ he laughed			0
‘ when we played @entity13 at home , their striker , @entity113 , ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us , sprinting			1
that is an incredible number			2
but at the weekend @entity40 ran 1300m ! ‘ you have to know the references of what it means to be fit			1
it ’s easy to say that to the other players , if i tell them how far @entity40 ran in a game and compare it to them			1
@entity4 highlighted how impressive @entity113 's running was against his side in the @entity128 clash ‘ if a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing , i can show him the numbers			1
if he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m , what does he think of that ? ‘ why ca n’t @entity40 run as far every game ? @entity139 ran 900m on sunday and he did n’t play the whole game			1
’ it was pointed out that @entity139 actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing @entity142 against @entity11 , before being hurt and making way for @entity144			1
was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked ? the winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the @entity151 six points clear ‘ it was cramp , he ’ll be okay for ( tonight ’s game ) against @entity157 , ’ said the @entity3 manager			1
‘ it was a sign that he is not strong enough yet			0
you have to think of the mental and physical loading on a player			0
‘ just coming to @entity3 - dealing with the contract , the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in @entity40 and @entity139			1
‘ then the training is at a much higher tempo then they have been used to before			0
the total loading gets too much			0
that ’s why @entity139 started on the bench			0
‘ but then @entity174 is doing it every day			0
he is so strong , unbelievably strong			0
why ? because he has done this for many years , he works really hard every single day and he looks after himself			0
@entity177 is also starting to get that into his body			0
’ so is it a case of simply saying the best teams are the fittest teams ? @entity174 has been praised by his manager for his unbelievable strength and work ethic ‘ no , that ’s not true , ’ countered @entity4			0
‘ but that ’s the easiest thing to do something with			0
i do n’t think the best teams are the fittest – they could be – but there are so many parameters , so many boxes you have to fill in football			0
‘ we do n’t train more than they did before but hopefully we train better and we give more in that hour - and - a - half every day			0
‘ as for the stats , we use them in different situations			0
it is not only stats about running but who has been involved in goal chances offensively and defensively			0
instead of saying something subjectively , you can see it as a fact			0
@entity139 is also a willing runner for @entity3 and his stats are impressive since he joined the club ‘ but everything has to be related to football			1
we are not marathon runners			0
it is about what we do on the pitch			0
’ what @entity3 have done on @entity219 pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches			1
making it 11 against @entity157 at @entity32 will push them nine points clear of @entity11			1
complacency might be the creeping danger , but @entity4 does n’t detect any traces of that corrosive commodity			0
‘ there is still so much to fight for , ’ he insisted			0
‘ we are working here on the culture , every day , to be 100 per cent every day			0
‘ i have no reason to be worried because i have n’t once seen the players have a bad attitude or a lack of concentration			2
i am really looking forward to the game and i expect a good performance and hopefully a good result			0
