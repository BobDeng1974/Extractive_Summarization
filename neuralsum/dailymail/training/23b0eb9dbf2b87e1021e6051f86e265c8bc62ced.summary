it was an afternoon for sharp mathematicians at the @entity2 as @entity3 squeezed through to the @entity5 quarter - finals despite losing to @entity7 heavyweights @entity6			1
@entity8 , ceo of the @entity10 club , kept an anxious eye on unfoldings elsewhere as @entity14 ’s narrow defeat by @entity15 ultimately booked @entity3 a knock - out trip to big - spending @entity17			1
@entity19 ’ decision to field a weakened side in their @entity22 matches created a skewed points difference that almost cost @entity3 their hopes of progression as one of the three best runners - up			2
@entity28 of @entity3 is hauled down by @entity29 of @entity6 before being replaced ‘ it is so disappointing to see a club like @entity19 throw up the white flag , ’ said director of rugby @entity30			1
‘ it is meant to be an elite competition and that should not be tolerated			0
we give a lot of thanks to @entity15 for fronting up against @entity14			0

that effectively turned the fixture into a shootout for a home tie			0

@entity28 walked off unassisted but later left the ground on crutches with his left knee in a brace			0
@entity61 of @entity6 is tackled by @entity3 duo @entity62 and @entity63 @entity57 , too , was off target with his opening kick at goal , and that lack of execution was punished by @entity6 on the half - hour mark when @entity70 scored			1

it provided territory for @entity57 to kick a penalty before the break and the fly - half added three more points from the boot later on			0
