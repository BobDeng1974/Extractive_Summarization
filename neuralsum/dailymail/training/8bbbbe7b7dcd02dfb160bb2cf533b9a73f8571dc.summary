scientists have found evidence that a 1945 earthquakes released more than seven million cubic metres of methane into the @entity10 as a greenhouse gas , methane is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide , but less abundant in the atmosphere			1
enormous quantities of methane are locked in icy structures called hydrates on the floors of the continental shelves surrounding the @entity29 's land masses			0
an estimated 1,000 to 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon is trapped in methane hydrates - more than the total amount released by burning fossil fuels each year			2
analysis of sediment cores taken from the @entity10 in 2007 revealed chemical signs of large - scale methane release			2
a search of historical records showed that a magnitude 8.1 earthquake had occurred nearby in 1945			0
' based on several indicators , we postulated that the earthquake led to a fracturing of the sediments , releasing the gas that had been trapped below , ' said lead scientist dr @entity48 , from the @entity49 in @entity50			0
the study , published in @entity52 , could show that earthquakes contribute to global warming a conservative estimate indicated that roughly 7.4 million cubic metres of methane had escaped , said the researchers writing in the journal @entity52			1
' there are probably even more sites in the area that had been affected by the earthquake , ' dr @entity59 added			0
methane hydrates have been suggested as a promising energy source , but mining them is expensive and risky			0
the hydrates help to stabilise the ocean floor , and there is a chance that disturbing them will trigger land slips and tsunamis .			0

scientists find methane released into @entity10 by 1945 earthquake
more than seven million cubic metres of methane was released by quake
discovery shows natural source of greenhouse gas emissions , they claim
