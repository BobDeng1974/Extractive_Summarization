i told him he has a family history of bowel cancer , but they just were n’t interested			1
he finally got taken in on the 11 november			0
' finally we went to a medial centre and we said we ’re not going anywhere until we know what ’s wrong with him			0
' we ’re not being fobbed off again and again – we basically said to people at the hospital and said we ’re not going anywhere until it ’s sorted			0
big day : @entity20 in her wedding dress outside of the hospital ' then a surgeon had a feel of his tummy and could feel something in his bowels , and that ’s when they did the ct scan and found it was cancer			1
' it was awful finding out – we ’ve got two small children			0
he ’s been in hospital since			0
in the four weeks since he had his tumour removed the cancer spread quite far			0
' but despite being struck by such a desperate illness , @entity7 's thoughts remained with his young family throughout - and how he would provide for them			1
@entity20 said : ' he ’s quite a family man , he insists he brings the money in			2
so he went to work two or three times while he was ill , but could n’t really do much , because he had major stomach cramps which would go and come back ' for the last couple of days before he went to hospital he was just in bed all day and did n’t eat for two weeks			0
' @entity7 ’s best friend @entity46 – when he went into hospital he was really concerned about money , as he has a family and a house to keep up			1
' that was the only thing he was talking about before his first op , saying he wanted to make money for us			0
