by @entity0 , business correspondent published : 20:36 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 04:31 est , 27 november 2012 property ladder : young people are having to wait longer to buy their first property - with two - thirds relying on help from their parents two - thirds of first - time buyers are relying on the ‘ @entity9 ’ to get on the property ladder			1
figures released yesterday by the @entity12 highlight the crippling impact of high house prices on a generation of young people , who are forced into renting or living with parents or friends			1
the @entity12 said 66 per cent of first - time buyers in recent years have had parental assistance courtesy of what has become known as the ‘ @entity9 ’			1
this rises to 72 per cent in @entity23 because house prices are so much higher in the capital – £ 364,000 on average , compared with £ 163,000 nationally			1
overall , the @entity12 said a typical first - time buyer is 29 , puts down a 20 per cent deposit – with parental help – and has a total household income of £ 34,000			1
in @entity23 , they are typically 31 , put down a 25 per cent deposit – also with help from their parents – and have a total household income of £ 50,000			1
by comparison , retired homeowners over the age of 65 have more than £ 750billion of ‘ property wealth ’ tied up in the value of their homes , the equity release firm @entity35 said yesterday			2
housing minister @entity42 has said it ‘ can not be right ’ that so many young people are unable to fulfil their dream of buying their own home			1
speaking at a @entity12 conference earlier this month , the @entity47 mp , a former chartered surveyor , said the @entity49 had inherited ‘ a dysfunctional housing market whether it is freehold or leasehold ’			1
he added : ‘ we see 1.6million young people – people in their 20s and 30s – still living with mum and dad because they ca n’t afford their own place			2
that can not be right			2
’ at the same conference , @entity61 , chairman of the @entity12 , said owning a home was still hugely important to millions			2
he said : ‘ we know – pretty much – that the @entity66 housing psyche , while a bit bruised , still holds homeownership extremely dear			1
’ but he added that it is ‘ more difficult to achieve than it used to be ’ , and would - be owners need to accept renting ‘ is likely to be a tenure in which most new households will spend at least some time			2
’ around 17million people in @entity66 own their own home , around nine million have a mortgage and around eight million have no loan and own their property outright			2
but the number of first - time buyers getting a loan has collapsed since the credit crunch			0
there were around 570,000 in 2001 , but only 193,000 last year			0
@entity83 , 26 , and his girlfriend @entity84 , 25 , managed to get on the property ladder last year , thanks to miss @entity84 ’s father			0
the couple , who were childhood sweethearts , had saved a deposit of £ 7,000			0
but they were only able to afford their three - bedroom home in @entity94 , the @entity95 , because miss @entity84 ’s father , @entity96 , used his savings to help them under @entity99 ’s @entity98 a @entity100			0
it meant the couple only needed to put down a 5 per cent deposit on their £ 148,000 home			0
mr @entity106 put around £ 30,000 into a savings account at the bank , which acts as a guarantee on repayments			0
mr @entity83 joked that without his help , ‘ we would n’t have been able to buy for at least 25 years ’			0
he added : ‘ @entity84 ’s dad did everything that he could to help us to buy something that could be our home			0
’ last week , a @entity118 report said that the availability of credit ‘ continued to restrain first - time buyers ’ , and added that stamp duty thresholds may also be ‘ restraining ’ homeowners from trading up to a larger property			0
for example , the tax is charged at 3 per cent on a property of £ 500,000 but it jumps to 4 per cent at £ 500,001			0
@entity129 , of @entity130 , a first - time buyer campaign group , said : ‘ @entity132 - high house prices are destroying the aspirations of a whole generation of would - be first time buyers			1
@entity66 simply ca n’t call itself a property - owning democracy if homeownership is only open to those from the wealthiest backgrounds			0
’ concern : housing minister @entity42 said the coalition had inherited a ' dysfunctional housing market '			1
