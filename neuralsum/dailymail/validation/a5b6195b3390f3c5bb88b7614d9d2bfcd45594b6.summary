just for a moment , when he gained a thin edge to an attempted pull off @entity4 ' s @entity3 in @entity5 , it was possible to believe that @entity6 was human after all			1
all other evidence suggests the @entity8 known as @entity6 is some kind of super power , a man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed when he decided to make taking one - day batting to another , exalted level his destiny			1
nothing sums up @entity20 's out - dated methods at this otherwise expansive @entity21 than to watch the extraordinary @entity22 going about his work			1
@entity8 captain @entity6 leaves the field during the @entity21 match against @entity4 @entity26 leaves the field after being dismissed by @entity28 of @entity29 during the @entity21 match okay , perhaps it is unfair to criticise them for not living up to a genius who has defied belief with the most spectacular batting in cricket history but @entity22 has become the benchmark now for everyone else to attempt to emulate			1
we are lucky he is a cricketer at all			2
@entity22 grew up in @entity42 playing hockey , football , rugby , tennis and badminton to international standard at age - group level while also being an accomplished sprinter and swimmer			1
these days , in his spare time , he plays golf off scratch on top of being an all - round cricketer who keeps wicket , bowls and fields to a high level for his country as well as indisputably the best limited - overs batsman in the world			1
give him the throne of @entity65 and he would surpass even the legendary @entity66			2
@entity67 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity69 during the 2015 @entity21 match @entity22 looks on after the dismissal of teammate @entity72 during the match at @entity74 and those who have suggested the current @entity20 team may be a bit too nice to succeed in this tournament might like to note that it is hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about @entity22			2
perhaps the suggestion of a receding hair - line , at the age of 31 , is his only nod towards mortality			1
@entity22 has been around for 10 years now at the highest level but it is with two particular innings in the last two months that he has breathed life into the 50 - over format and re-written the rules on what can be possible			1
first , against the @entity94 in @entity95 in january , @entity22 reached three figures in just 31 balls , going from nought to a hundred in 40 minutes and smashing 16 sixes , the same number as @entity102 's @entity101 during his record - breaking 264 against @entity29			2
a dejected @entity69 looks on during @entity20 's game against @entity29 in @entity104 , @entity105 @entity22 talks to teammate @entity106 during the 2015 @entity21 match then , in this @entity21 , he demolished the poor , hapless @entity108 again with an extraordinary unbeaten 162 , racing from a hundred to 150 in just 12 balls			0
@entity22 now holds the records for the fastest 50 , 100 and 150 in one - day international history			1
@entity113 , at one stage looking set for a total of around 270 , instead made the small matter of 408 for five			0
@entity22 does not look particularly powerful , as @entity117 does , nor stocky and pugnacious like @entity118 and @entity119			0
there is plenty that is orthodox about his methods but also an incredible ability to hit full - length balls outside of off - stump to the leg - side for six			2
when he is in full flow he is a joy to behold and for a while , against @entity4 on saturday , he looked capable of winning the match on his own until that thin edge saw his side consigned to defeat			0
@entity113 are a notoriously fragile tournament team but in their captain they have a man capable of taking them all the way to the final			2
@entity26 leaves the field after being dismissed during the @entity21 match between @entity20 and @entity29 a @entity139 talks to @entity6 during the @entity21 match between @entity113 and @entity4 the lesson for @entity20 to absorb is that the pioneers of this new impossible is nothing brand of one - day cricket are basically playing @entity145 over 50 overs			1
even now , while all evidence points to a different approach , they still prefer to treat a one - day international as a shortened @entity150 innings			1
they do have the players capable of doing it the modern way , that 's the frustration of @entity20 's @entity21 so far			0
none more so than @entity157 , whose eyes positively lit up when asked if the @entity21 had been exciting him			0
' definitely , ' said @entity157			0
' @entity6 is i someone i look at who has played some amazing knocks			1
the introduction of the @entity165 and @entity145 , people are coming up with things and the hitting at the end is nothing short of spectacular			0
@entity20 coach @entity170 looks on during the @entity21 match between @entity20 and @entity29 @entity172 celebrates with @entity22 and the team after taking a catch to dismiss @entity175 of @entity4 ' as a fan of cricket you watch these guys perform at the top of their profession and you take a step back and enjoy it			2
@entity22 has been fantastic to watch			0
@entity183 faced two guys who were bowling at 90 miles per hour ( against @entity185 ) and was swinging even harder			0
there 's been some great moments as a fan to sit and watch and enjoy			0
' sadly not many of them have involved @entity20 but what comes next is clear , whether they scrape into the knockout stages or not			0
@entity20 simply have to rip it up and start again in one - day cricket and build a new side around the likes of @entity157 , @entity26 , @entity196 and those coming through like @entity198 and @entity199			1
@entity22 has shown what is possible			0
now @entity20 have to play catch up			0
@entity172 celebrates the wicket of @entity202 of @entity4 with @entity6 and @entity203			1

evidence suggests @entity6 is some kind of super power
a man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed to be chosen
he has become the benchmark now for everyone else to attempt to emulate
@entity217 has taken one - day batting to another , exalted level
