i have never felt such unbearable pain like it			0
i just sat staring at the wall in disbelief that our baby was gone			0
i have gone through so many emotions from overwhelming grief to feeling so down to thinking i never ever want to see another pregnancy test ever again because the thought would totally freak me out and emotionally i just could n't deal with it to just so angry and wondering why ? was it something i did ? when i was at secondary school for the five years that i was there and also for the five years that @entity9 was there not once did the uniform change			2
we had a choice of a jumper or a blazer plus the @entity205 kit			0
so why now do schools - secondary and primary feel the need that they need to change these uniforms every couple of years			0
our primary school changed theirs two years ago but to be fair we have used this school for 14 years and this was the first time that they had changed it			0
it ’s a different story for the high school , we have just had yet another letter saying that they are going to change uniforms again , so we have gone from jumpers to blazers as they said they are smarter looking but oh no they have changed their minds again and we are now going back to jumpers with a new logo so i would imagine that the @entity205 kit will want changing also			0
this week has been fun in the @entity23 house , we ’ve had @entity230 with chicken pox , luckily she has n’t really suffered with them and definitely has n’t been as covered in them as what i remember last time ours got them			0
we have n’t had any children get chicken pox for over 8 years but it would be just before we are due to go on holiday !			0

@entity9 and @entity22 have nine sons and seven daughters , but receive no benefits
@entity9 started a blog about family life with her large brood
