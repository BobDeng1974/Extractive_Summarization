as suburban populations increase in places like @entity3 , there is no space left for coyotes to live and roam for their prey			1
therefore almost 2,000 have ventured into a new habitat - among the skyscrapers of downtown @entity3			1
the animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built - up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars			1
over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the @entity20 - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children			0
but the suburban sprawl and increase in out - of - town developments have prompted some to migrate to more urban areas			1
@entity50 , a wildlife ecologist at @entity32 in @entity51 , told @entity52 that the versatile creatures are ' expanding their ecological envelope '			0
' we felt there were parts of @entity3 too urban , with too many people , for coyotes to live â€” and we were wrong , ' he said			1
' they 're a humbling animal '			0
@entity62 , who has been tracking urban coyotes in @entity3 since 2000 , tagged 850 coyotes with gps devices and placed radio collars on about 400			1
during the course of the project they have found that coyotes thrive in urban populations - living longer than their rural cousins and being more active at night			1
@entity73 attached to the animals show them stopping and waiting for cars , rushing between streets and following their mates			0
because of access to a wider range of resources - such as discarded food - they are able to produce larger litters of puppies , with an average of up to nine per pack			0
one gps - collared coyote named 748 and his mate were able to raise a litter of five pups inside a secret concrete den in the parking lot of @entity92 , home of the @entity93			0
one gps - collared coyote managed to raise five pups in a secret concrete den in the parking lot of @entity92 , the home of the @entity93 the survey is run by the urban coyote ecology and management based in @entity98			0
their website reads : ' originally known as ghosts of the plains , coyotes have now become ghosts of the cities , occasionally heard but less often seen			2
' with the exception of a few individuals , coyotes have largely learned to avoid us			1
' the movement of the carnivores into the city was embraced in 2011 , when officials used one to help rid the streets of rats			2
some locals were surprised at the move because attacks on humans are rare , but not unknown , however the results were limited			0
they more frequently target pets , prompting some communities around the country to take action to stop them			0
residents of a @entity126 town have enlisted a hired gun to rid the town of coyotes , responsible for several recent attacks on pets			2
in september officials in a @entity134 suburb beset by a surge in coyote attacks on pets , including a small dog snatched from its owner 's living room , approved a plan to trap and kill some of the wild canines roaming the town			2
the @entity145 of @entity146 , a seaside community of about 25,000 residents south of @entity148 , took the action this week following an uproar over a rise in coyotes venturing into neighborhoods to prey on dogs and cats			2
earlier this year , an extreme , hybrid form of the carnivore was spotted in @entity158 and land north of the @entity160			0
the ' coywolf ' - created after wolves and eastern coyotes mated - were forced to live in built - up areas because of the increase in population			1
the wolf genes allow the coyote to take down bigger prey , while the coyote genes allow them to adapt to cities			0
location : suburban sprawl has meant that downtown and built - up areas are one of the only places coyotes can set up their habitats strong : in comparison to their rural cousins , urban coyotes live longer and can develop larger families			1

around 2,000 coyotes thought to be living in the @entity3
have learned to live in close quarters with people and cross busy roads
they are strictly nocturnal and will sleep near *sidewalks* during the day
suburban sprawl means downtown areas are one of their last *options*
some have been used by the city to kill rodents
