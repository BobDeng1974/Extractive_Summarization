@entity1 , 81 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , became one of the oldest people in the country to be given an asbo in august last year after carrying out an ' ongoing campaign of harassment ' against @entity20 and @entity21			1
during that hearing , the court heard how @entity24 would beep his car horn all day and night , make loud animal noises , scrape shovels along the ground to make a racket and slowly drive past the couple while staring at them			1
he also repeatedly accused mrs @entity32 , 43 , of having an affair with an ex-policeman and swore at the couple in front of children			2
the court heard how dead rats and rabbits , chickens ’ feet and a mallards head had also appeared in the @entity44 ' garden			1
but yesterday , the retired lorry driver was again hauled before the courts for continuing to carry out the long - running ' hate ' campaign			0
the court heard @entity24 has continued to beep his horn at the @entity44 and had also thrown bags over their fence , which contained newspaper cuttings about so - called neighbours from hell			1
but , despite there being ' no sign of abatement ' to his harassment campaign , magistrates spared seed jail			2
presiding magistrate @entity63 said @entity24 's poor health - and the fact he cared for his elderly wife - meant he should not be sent to prison			1
speaking after the sentence , mr @entity21 , 48 , slammed the decision saying : ' we knew he ’d play on the fact he ’s 81 , but his health does n’t stop him harassing us			1
' the campaign of abuse against the @entity44 began in 2008 , shortly after the couple moved into their bungalow and put up a fence on their property			1
during last year 's hearing , @entity1 pleaded guilty to harassing his neighbours and was given a community supervision for 12 months			1
he was also banned from using foul or abusive language , along with his asbo			2
but during yesterday 's case , prosecutor @entity87 said there had been five or six separate breaches of the asbo since march this year			1
seed also beeped his car horn continuously while the couple were at home on march 24			1
in june this year , @entity24 began ' shouting , swearing and being abusive ' towards the couple for playing their radio in their garden - an incident mr @entity21 caught on video			1
in the footage , the pensioner can be seen leaning over the garden fence that separates the two properties , shouting profanities			1
he is then filmed smirking into the camera lens , before swearing and shouting at mr @entity21 , who is filming			1
he shouts : ' i pity your wife , but actually i do n't , because she 's a f * * * ing ugly cow ' seed is filmed for more than a minute by his neighbour and does not appeared to be fazed by the camera he then then grabs a metal garden rake and waves it at mr @entity21 , while shouting ' i pity your wife , but actually i do n't , because she 's a f * * * ing ugly cow			1
' @entity138 , mr @entity63 said : ' the report makes for a very sorry read			2
this has been an ongoing campaign of harassment which has been going on for years with no sign of abatement			0
' i ’m not prepared to accept that your neighbours are in any way to blame			0
all they would like is to live their lives in peace which is not a great deal to ask			0
' last year , you were made the subject of an asbo after a long - running dispute with your neighbours and you were given a community order at the same time			2
' in march you breached this and it has gone on for far too long			0
there are only two ways to bring this to an end			0
' he is so hateful towards our family and it has been absolute hell			0
he ’s so bitter inside and i know this wo n’t be the last			0
it ’s not fair that we are left to suffer ' mr @entity21 ' you can either look at yourself in the mirror and make a decision to bring it to an end or the other option is for the court to send you to prison			1
' there are a catalogue of incidents i have heard about that are so serious they can only be dealt with by a custodial sentence			0
' but , you are 81 - years - old and you are not in the best of health and you look after your wife , who is of a similar age			2
' no court would want to send an 81 - year - old man to prison but i can assure you it will if it needs to			0
' mr @entity21 , a council worker , said : ' we were hoping for a prison sentence			1
' i think he thinks of himself as a loveable rogue and he believes he ’s always right			0
he does n’t have a lot in his life and he just sits and waits for us to get home			0
' he is so hateful towards our family and it has been absolute hell			0
he ’s so bitter inside and i know this wo n’t be the last			0
it ’s not fair that we are left to suffer			2
' mrs @entity32 added : ' all we want is for him to leave us alone so we can enjoy our lives			0
' seed was sentenced to nine months in prison , suspended for two years , and his asbo was extended for five years			2
he was fined £ 165 and was given a curfew to last four months			0
seed previously avoided jail in 2003 after he admitted killing up to 10 cats by smashing them over the head with a hammer and then drowning them in a dustbin filled with water .			0
