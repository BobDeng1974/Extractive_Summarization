by @entity0 police have warned pet owners after two dogs died and three others needed medical treatment when they ate poisoned meat which was found in a park			1
a mysterious poisoner apparently used the deadly toxin methomyl to poison pieces of meat which they then left to be eaten in @entity13 in @entity14 , north - west @entity15			1
local police have teamed up with the @entity17 in a bid to find the culprit and prevent other animals from suffering the same fate			1
poison : two dogs have died after ingesting a toxic substance in @entity13 in @entity14 , pictured @entity17 chief inspector @entity24 said : ' this kind of poison is extremely toxic for dogs and other animals if consumed and it is very concerning to hear that this is what caused the recent deaths			1
' we urge anyone who knows of any person who has a stock of this particular insecticide at home or in even their shed or garage to talk the police or ourselves in complete confidence , so we can investigate further			0
' a @entity44 spokesman added : ' it 's distressing and disturbing to think that somebody could be using such a dangerous toxin so indiscriminately			0
' police urged dog owners to be extra vigilant , and advised people to wear gloves if handling any toxic substances			2
danger : pet owners should be vigilant in order to avoid the risk of coming into contact with methomyl sergeant @entity59 , of @entity60 , said : ' with better weather and longer hours of daylight the parks will be busier and i am hopeful that any criminal activity is more likely to be seen and phoned through to us			1
' it is a criminal offence under the @entity68 intentionally to give a poison to an animal			0
no one has yet been arrested over the apparent poisonings , and it is not clear whether or not the toxic meat was in fact deliberately left around @entity13			1
@entity76 is a synthetic chemical which is extremely toxic to humans and animals			0
it is used as a pesticide , but its use is restricted in @entity82 because of the dangers it poses and it is not widely available in shops			0
reports of animal poisoning increased by nearly 10 per cent in the last year , according to the @entity17 , with a total of 1,154 complaints			2
however , the charity has also warned that many animal lovers are accidentally poisoning their pets by allowing them to come into contact with toxic substances such as chocolate or rhubarb			2
chief veterinary officer @entity99 said said : ' chocolate poisoning is one of the most commonly reported types of animal poisoning , so @entity104 is the ideal time to remind people of the hazards around their home that could accidentally poison their pets			0
' @entity109 are a tasty treat for many of us , but a hefty vet 's bill wo n't be quite so easy to swallow if your pet ends up wolfing them down before you			0

meat laced with deadly poison methomyl was left around @entity13 in north - west @entity15
@entity60 and @entity17 are now *hunting* the poisoner *responsible*
