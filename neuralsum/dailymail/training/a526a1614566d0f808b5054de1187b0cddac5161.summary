@entity282 , a trustee of the estate and a relative of mr @entity285 , said : ' what we do not know is what those services rendered overseas were which prompted the king to gift @entity79 to @entity166			1
' @entity164 was a royal estate , with inhabitants living on it like modern - day tenants			2
' one can only speculate but 1349 was right in the thick of the @entity296 - perhaps @entity166 took part and was rewarded with ownership of the estate for fighting against the @entity201			1
' @entity164 remained with the @entity300 until 1906 , when the widow of @entity302 , a @entity166 descendent , left it to her godson , @entity304 and his wife @entity305 , satisfied that a handful of other @entity308 descendents would be well provided for by three further country properties the family owned			2
