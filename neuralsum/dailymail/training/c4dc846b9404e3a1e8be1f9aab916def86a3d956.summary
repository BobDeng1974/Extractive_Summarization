by @entity0 the father of a severely ill newborn baby has launched a desperate appeal to save his son 's life and bring him home from @entity6 for treatment			1
when tiny @entity11 was born on may 5 his parents @entity9 , 30 and @entity10 were told their son had the rare heart condition , @entity14			1
the illness means only the left side of @entity11 's heart can function and he will require a three - step operation to survive			1
mr @entity11 , who moved to @entity19 in 2007 to work as a teacher , said immediately after his son was born he was taken away from the couple as @entity6 policy dictated he needed to be cared for in isolation			1
@entity25 was born in @entity6 on may 5			0
within hours of his birth his parents @entity9 and @entity10 were told he had the rare condition @entity14 on the second day of his short life , @entity11 and mrs @entity28 were told their baby son had just 24 hours to live , because the @entity6 hospital did not have the resources necessary to care for @entity11			1
the distraught couple discharged their son and upgraded him to the @entity36 - style @entity35 , with the help of mr @entity11 's friend and boss @entity38			1
there doctors said @entity11 could survive but he faces very risky surgery when he is a month old			2
the procedure , to implant a @entity45 shunt , aims to restart the left side of @entity11 's heart			1
if successful , the tiny baby could be deemed well enough to fly back to the @entity49 for his second operation			2
but the couple have used up their life savings on hospital fees in @entity6 , and are now launching a desperate appeal to raise money to continue funding @entity11 's treatment			1
' we still need to raise more so @entity11 can have the first operation so he can return safely to the @entity49 for the second and third step operations , ' said mr @entity11			1
' for the first few months , @entity11 will be isolated as he can not risk to be infected , therefore we will not be able to see him for that length of time			0
' during the first few days of understanding our child ’s condition , my wife and i were going through a range of emotions			0
' i wrote a log to vent feelings and also to keep a record of everything that we ’d experience so far for future reference			0
' @entity11 is currently in a stable condition , with doctors predicting he has a good chance of surviving the risky first procedure			2
his parents have launched a desperate bid to raise money to pay for his first operation and after care in @entity6 and to fund bringing him back to the @entity49 where he will need another two operations mr @entity11 , who is originally from @entity86 , @entity87 , added : ' with @entity11 stable enough we contacted @entity90 from the @entity92 hospital who was extremely understanding with our situation			1
' we had an idea to fly @entity11 from @entity19 to @entity96 using the @entity97 but as it turns out that because of the severity of his condition and lack of prior insurance we could not afford to fly him out with the medical assistance			2
@entity14 is a very rare condition which causes the right side of the heart to be underdeveloped at birth			1
it results in the chambers , valves and blood vessels of the right side of the heart being malformed			0
these malformations include a very small right ventricle and a small pulmonary artery			0
the malformation means the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently to the lungs causing low blood oxygen levels			0
symptoms of the condition normally develop almost immediately after a baby is born			0
affected babies often take on a bluish tint - particularly to their skin , lips and fingernails			0
treatment options include open - heart surgery and a heart transplant			2
source : congenital heart defects @entity49 ' so at least the first operation must be performed here in @entity19 , and it ’s usually common for a child to be in the hospital for four months average before they are discharged			2
' our life savings , which were meant to be used for a return to the @entity49 , have been spent in a matter of days			1
' that is why we are asking for help and donations for @entity11 and other children who need similar help when insurers find it difficult to provide for them			0
' we would like the readers to be aware all extra money that is donated after we reach our goal will be re-donated to other children heart foundations in the @entity49 and @entity6 so they can also provide care that is needed during a heart wrenching time			1
' a target of £ 15,000 has been set and a third of that has been raised so far			0
mr @entity11 added : ' it is difficult for us but at the same time , we find this a painful yet small price to pay for a chance at life for our boy			0
' constantine would not be where he is without the help of people like @entity167 , the team at @entity169 ( @entity170 ) and the parents who helped us with donations , dr @entity174 and all the staff at @entity176 , dr @entity90 and @entity92 and dr @entity177 at @entity178			0
