@entity5 actor @entity13 said he was a big fan of the @entity15 reality show , but accused viewers of discriminating against black contestants by voting them out in round five every year			1
his comments – which come after a series of @entity7 contestants complained they were exposed to racist abuse after appearing on the show – prompted campaigners to call for more protection to be given to those who appear on the show			1
the 34 - year - old , who is known for his starring roles in hit sitcom @entity30 and romantic comedy bridesmaids , told the @entity32 : ‘ i ’m a big @entity7 fan			1
generally my favourites go out in the first few weeks and , of course , because the viewing public is so racist , all the black , strong singers go out in round five every year			1
’ two of the @entity7 ’s past winners , @entity38 and @entity40 , are mixed race while the boyband @entity42 which was runner - up to @entity44 are black and the show has featured many black contestants			1
but it has also been hit by a series of complaints that ethnic minority singers are discriminated against as they reach the later stages of the competition			2
one of the favourites to win last year ’s series , 17 - year - old @entity54 , complained she faced a barrage of online abuse about her colour before she was voted off in the seventh week			2
she had to compete in a sing - off three times before her eviction because she received such a low number of public votes			2
she claimed she faced a barrage of online abuse about her colour after the show reflecting on her experience , she said : ‘ i ’ve received a lot of horrible , racist comments on @entity71			1
people say i ’m too dark to be a singer			0
people say , ‘ you ’re black and ugly ’ , nasty things like that			0
‘ the sad thing is most of them are made by black people who just have lighter skin than me			0
i ’m just like , " whatever "			0
i know they are talking rubbish			0
’ meanwhile boy band @entity86 , who made it to week nine of last year ’s competition , also claimed they faced online abuse from viewers			2
@entity92 said he was described as a ‘ monkey ’ online , while his bandmate @entity94 said : ‘ someone said on @entity71 , “ you black * * * * * ca n’t even sing – you should get off @entity7 ” ’			1
in 2011 , another show favourite , 19 - year - old @entity98 , sparked a race row after she was evicted in the semi-finals			0
attacked : boy band @entity86 revealed they received racist online abuse from viewers many attributed her failure to win to the fact she was accused of bullying other contestants by judges @entity107 and @entity109			1
but some commentators said she was a victim of racism			0
one , @entity112 , said : ‘ @entity115 and @entity115 @entity114 people are a minority in this country , so in order to win , you ’ve got to appeal to the masses			0
this means less keeping it real and more keeping it bland — like chicken korma			0
’ another campaigner , @entity125 , said at the time that 2006 winner miss @entity38 was only able to win because she was not black but ‘ international beige ’			0
and he claimed 2008 winner @entity44 only succeeded because her popular show mentor @entity127 supported her so strongly			2
he said : ‘ all manner of attempts were made throughout the series to persuade us that we were really voting for @entity127 , our new @entity132 , to win the competition between judges that year			0
’ @entity98 , 19 , pictured centre next to @entity136 and @entity137 , sparked a race row when she was evicted in the semi-finals in 2011 yesterday , @entity142 - @entity141 director @entity140 said the @entity7 ’s creators could not be held responsible for the reactions of viewers towards contestants			1
but she added : ‘ there does need to be a debate around what sort of controls we put on @entity71 , because appearing on a show like this can expose you to a lot of vitriol and it is easier than ever for vile abuse to be written about you anonymously online			1
‘ it could be that we need to protect contestants more from this type of material , even if there is nothing the producers can do about the votes that are cast			0
’ last night an @entity7 source said : ‘ @entity7 has a long standing record of celebrating a diverse range of artists including two former winners , @entity38 and @entity40 , and numerous others who have reached the final stages of the competition including this year ’s semi-finalists @entity86 , along with @entity42 , @entity177 and @entity178 in previous series			2

@entity5 actor claims he was a big fan of the popular @entity15 reality show
but he accused @entity7 viewers of voting out the black , strong singers
his comments come after contestants complained of racist abuse they received after appearing on @entity7
campaigners are calling for more protection for the show *'s* singers
