by @entity1 reporter lt. col. @entity2 , arriving at @entity3 a decorated @entity5 hero , a landowner , and @entity9 @entity8 peer are embroiled in a bitter @entity10 battle - over a 500 yard piece of muddy land			1
former lieutenant colonel @entity13 , 52 , claims he was granted a right of way over a quarter of a mile long track when he bought his £ 3.25million country home from @entity20 peer @entity19 four years ago			1
the 500 - yard strip allows horse riders using his commercial livery yard to reach a nearby bridleway where they can hack over the @entity26 countryside			0
mr @entity13 says he bought the land believing that it came with the access rights			1
but the owner of the land , @entity30 , 46 , claims he has no such rights , and has now erected locked gates to keep people out			1
he claims riders from the livery centre , created by mr @entity13 , are disturbing game birds he keeps , and fears it could put an end to a renowned annual shoot he hosts			1
the move has forced mr @entity13 to re-direct horse riders across muddy fields from the stables he built around his home			2
he is also unable to drive vehicles to reach a vital road which runs alongside the properties			0
the bitter dispute is now before the @entity10 , sitting in @entity51 , where a judge heard mr @entity13 believed the right of way came as part of buying his home			0
mr @entity13 told the court : ' i want my access uninterrupted			1
i have a right of way granted to me by my predecessor which required me access to those areas			0
' mr @entity30 told me it was his right to put the gates on the lane and he was ‘ forced to take defensive action ’			0
' he said he wanted to make it absolutely clear that he " will continue to protect my rights "			0
' the court heard how the land in question near @entity73 , @entity26 , was originally part of some put up for sale in 1998 for a total of £ 7 million			0
mr @entity13 claims he was granted right of way over the rack when he bought his home from @entity20 peer @entity19 ( left ) four years ago			1
but the land owner , @entity30 ( right ) , 46 , claims he has no such right but when a sale fell through it was separated into lots , three of which were bought by @entity19 and turned into his home , the 35 - acre @entity88			1
the fourth parcel of land was snapped up by mr @entity30 , who moved into the property included in the sale			2
@entity19 claims @entity88 had access rights to nearby bridleways - despite the fact he had to cross his neighbour ’s land to reach them			1
he told the court : ' i was clear during the whole time i was there i enjoyed a right of access at all times for all purposes			2
' mr @entity30 and i did n’t discuss boundaries and details at any time , we had a good relationship , we got on			2
' when i wanted to deepen a trench for flood defences [ on his land ] i did n’t feel the need to go to him to ask			0
' using the route was convenient for me and i did it from time to time			0
' in 2009 @entity19 sold his property , alongside the presumed rights , to mr @entity13 , who immediately began building a menage on the stables he had been left			1
lieutenant colonel @entity13 - who lives and works at @entity122 ( @entity123 ) and @entity30 - who lives next door , @entity126 , ( @entity127 )			1
the lane marked in yellow is the disputed land / access but mr @entity30 took immediate exception to the new construction , complaining about its size and the noise it would generate			1
' i do n’t object to horses disturbing my shoot , ' he told the court			0
' i would like to try and keep the horses down to a sensible number but obviously there are horses in the village and this new menage is clearly a growing business			0
' had there been an established livery or equestrian centre i would not have considered buying , there was no mention of horses during negotiations			0
mr @entity30 , 46 , has now erected locked gates to keep people out			2
he claims riders from the livery centre , created by mr @entity13 , are disturbing game birds he keeps , and fears it could put an end to a renowned annual shoot he hosts ( pictured is the land in dispute ) the move has forced mr @entity13 to re-direct horse riders across muddy fields from the stables he built around his home col @entity13 's home and business			1
despite not owning the land the veteran claims he was given a right of way to freely come and go when he purchased his house from @entity20 peer @entity19 , four years ago @entity30 's home			1
he believes a popular livery centre , created by mr @entity13 , is disturbing game birds he keeps and will ultimately put an end to a renowned partridge and pheasant shoot he hosts annually ' @entity180 was trespassing when he drove his vehicles down that lane but we have always got on and there has never been an issue			0
' the dispute continued and in january 2012 the disgruntled neighbour claimed builders had altered his land to make way for the building			0
in a letter sent to mr @entity13 ’s solicitors he wrote : ' following the meeting with your client i took advice from my solicitor and the land in which your client has constructed his new track appears to belong to me			2
' when mr @entity13 disputed this , the farmer began to build gates and warned the former soldier he would ' continue to protect my land '			2
the court heard mr @entity30 claims riders from the @entity212 could put an end to the famous @entity215 shoot he has spent 15 years creating			1
he believes sportsmen , paying nearly £ 1,000 a day to shoot partridge and pheasant on his land , would be forced to hold fire every time a horse rode by			0
