the former star of children ’s tv show @entity10 , who also appeared as a bond girl in @entity13 , said she is lucky to be alive after she ignored bouts of going blind and paralysis in one arm			1
she now realises it was ‘ heavily against the odds ’ that she made it to her mother ’s memorial service in april			1
bond girl : @entity1 , pictured from her modelling days in 1972 , featured in the film @entity13 warning : @entity1 says others she not make the same mistake and ignore such symptoms ‘ i was stupid , and extremely lucky to have got away with it			2
it was monumental good fortune that i ’m not damaged , ’ she said			1
miss @entity1 , 65 , a former model , said the first signs her life was in danger came on march 24 as she lay in bed reading			2
she said : ‘ i ’d been under a lot of stress , losing my mother , sorting out her things and organising her memorial service			1
‘ i was reading when my right eye suddenly could n’t see and my left arm went numb			1
but i got up and my body soon recovered			2
’ later , she walked to a friend ’s for lunch when the symptoms struck again as she ate			0
‘ i went blind in my right eye and my left arm went dead for ten minutes , ’ she said			2
‘ but neither of us thought it was serious			0
’ two days later , on march 26 , as she travelled by train to @entity51 in @entity53 ’s @entity52 to discuss the memorial service , a dark shadow descended over her right eye			1
she then lost the sight in that eye when the vision ‘ went all white ’			0
her gp referred her to @entity60 in @entity53 , where doctors discovered one of her arteries was 80 per cent blocked and in danger of triggering a full - blown stroke			0
she was admitted to @entity66 , @entity67 , where she had another mini-stroke – her fourth in 12 days – as surgeons performed a carotid endarterectomy to clear the artery of debris			0
fears : former model @entity1 , left , was organising the funeral of her late mother @entity6 , right , when she began suffering the mini-strokes even then miss @entity1 insisted she should be allowed to leave the hospital on april 8 to attend her mother ’s service the following day			1
‘ i did make the service , although i was n’t with it due to painkillers and wore a scarf to cover the wound on my neck , ’ she said			2
she is now warning others not to ignore the warning signs			0
‘ more must be done to explain to idiots like me that a mini-stroke can be very damaging , ’ she said			0
‘ i should have dialled 999 immediately			0
it horrifies me that i did n’t do that			0
