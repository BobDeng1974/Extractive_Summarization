billionaire entrepreneur @entity1 's @entity0 may take on @entity2 and other companies in developing electric cars			1
@entity1 , whose empire ranges from airlines to music stores , mobile phones and spaceships , said electric cars may be next			2
' we have teams of people working on electric cars , ' @entity1 told @entity15 in @entity16 where his virgin racing team competed in the all - electric @entity19 race that involves battery - powered cars			1
' so you never know , you may find @entity0 competing with the @entity2 in the car business as we do in the space business			0
' we will see what happens			0
' @entity1 's @entity31 is a commercial spaceflight company that competes with @entity33 , which was founded by @entity2 ceo @entity34			2
' we are working with the @entity37 team to develop the plan for next season 's cars , ' @entity0 spokesman @entity35 told @entity41			1
' our aim is to build a leading engine and car for next season			0
' maybe ultimately that could be used in the broader car market in the future			0
' in addition to @entity2 , most of the world 's automakers sell or are developing electric cars			1
the @entity0 firm could take on @entity34 's @entity2 electric car firm , according to @entity1			1
there are also signs @entity57 may be working on an electric car and @entity59 is developing a car that can drive itself			2
however , broader acceptance of electric cars has been held back by the premium consumers must pay for the technology and fears about the driving range of an all - electric vehicle			1
@entity1 told @entity15 , ' @entity2 is as sexy as any other car on the road today			2
' the streets snaking through downtown @entity16 's high rises will be buzzing this saturday as commuters make way for dart - shaped racing cars zooming by at breakneck speeds - and little noise			1
the race drivers will be competing in the first @entity19 race in the @entity79 since the all - electric series was launched in @entity81 in september 2014			1
halfway through its inaugural season , @entity19 has offered the same , albeit quieter , thrills as the popular @entity85 events , with low - slung , opened - wheeled cars capable of speeds up to 136 miles per hour ( 220 kilometers per hour )			1
the @entity81 race ended with a spectacular crash that sent one of the $ 500,000 @entity92 cars flying			2
danger and adrenaline are not all that you find on the track , however			0
' it 's really something to see how racing has evolved to fully electric motors			0
it could revolutionize racing and transportation in general , ' said @entity103 , 17 , who bought tickets with several high school friends to attend the race , which is expected to attract more than 50,000 spectators			0
the series was launched by @entity109 , a @entity111 racing icon and former @entity113 chief executive who heads of the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) that oversees @entity85			0
it is backed by environmentalist and actor @entity118 and entrepreneur @entity1 , whose @entity0 sponsors a two - car team			1
developing a so - called green racing series has meant overhauling how the races are run			0
car batteries can not be charged mid-race , forcing drivers at some point to rush into a second , fully charged car			0
the cars give off a high - pitched whistling sound , a bit like a dentist 's drill			2
drivers also must carefully manage their power , a challenge for race cars with a limited battery life			1
' we have a target ( power ) consumption per lap and we need to respect that like the @entity141 , ' said @entity142 , a 24 - year - old @entity143 driver with @entity0			0
' you want to win , but if you burn up all your energy you wo n't finish			0

@entity149 's @entity148 team competes all - electric @entity19 series
