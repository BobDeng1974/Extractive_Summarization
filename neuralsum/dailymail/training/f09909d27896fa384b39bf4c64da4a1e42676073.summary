by @entity0 when @entity1 and @entity2 , a young couple from @entity4 in @entity6 's northern beaches , missed out on a property at auction on saturday , @entity1 broke down			1
' it was hugely disappointing , ' said @entity10 , the real estate agent selling the property who has been trying to help the couple find a house for the last two years			1
mr @entity10 said the home was ' an entry - level home ' in @entity17 , and sold for just $ 1,000 more than @entity1 and @entity2 could afford			1
she was upset , they started walking out and @entity2 was rubbing her back , she was rubbing her eyes , ' mr @entity10 told @entity31			2
@entity1 and @entity2 , who have not been able to find a property in two years , represent a generation of first - home buyers struggling to make their way into an increasingly difficult @entity37 property market			1
' we are seeing a lot of disappointment , ' said mr @entity10			0
a @entity41 into @entity42 , taking place tomorrow in @entity44 , is investigating the difficulties presented by the conditions of the current property market			1
in november 2013 , the proportion of first - home buyers purchasing property dipped to the lowest historical level , with only 12.3 percent of all owner - occupied properties bought by first - time buyers			1
the drop was most pronounced in @entity55 , where the proportion of first - home buyers dropped from 19.2 percent in 2011 to 7.5 percent in 2013			1
average loan sizes taken out by first home buyers has increased 3.2 percent in the last year , to $ 302,233 , according to the most recent data from the @entity62 's @entity61			1
@entity63 and @entity64 have been searching for a house since last september and are considering long - term renting because of the high house prices mr and ms @entity64 attended an auction on saturday in @entity6 's west that was attended by 30 registered bidders and went for more than $ 300,000 above the advertised price @entity64 and @entity73 , both 29 , have been looking to purchase their first home in @entity6 since last september and because of the steep prices , are now facing the prospect of renting long - term , until house prices drop			1
' we 're looking in suburbs that are or should be affordable , ' ms @entity64 told @entity31			0
' we 're looking out west , we 're not looking in the inner west or the eastern suburbs			0
' ' be big and bold , get in early			0
there 's no benefit to holding back at all , some people think it 's best to bid on the second hammer and frustrate the other buyers , but the winning formula seems to be the people who get in early , ' said @entity10 from @entity93 @entity92			1
' things will get to the point where the bids go up by $ 500 and $ 1,000			0
people wo n't continue to keep going if they think they 're up against a strong contender			0
' sort out a budget and leave a buffer zone			0
buyers are going to have a number they think [ the property ] is worthy , they should always have a five percent buffer zone if they can afford it			1
' nothing in this market is going to go at a discounted rate			2
what you feel is market value is where you should come in [ with your first bid ] â€¦ coming in at market value can throw off the other buyer			2
' despite this , ms @entity64 said houses are going for hundreds of thousands of dollars above their market value			2
last saturday , @entity119 and ms @entity64 attended an auction for a house in @entity122 in @entity6 's west that was advertised in the mid- $ 700,000s , with the @entity125 property report listing the maximum value for the property as $ 865,000			2
' the opening bid at the auction was $ 900,000 , ' said ms @entity64			0
' there were about 30 registered bidders there , but there were only four active bidders after that			0
' it sold for $ 1.031 million , it 's crazy			0
' ms @entity64 said experiences like this one were ' shattering ' , particularly because the couple , who married in april , are ready to settle down			0
' but you ca n't get too attached and that 's hard because you want to and you want to settle down and make it your little nest			0
' given the state of the property market , she and her husband are considering long - term renting and other forms of investment			1
' we may just have to rent somewhere else but we 're not going to be bullied by the market into over-investing and not getting value for money , ' she said			2
' we 're going to find something that 's affordable			0
