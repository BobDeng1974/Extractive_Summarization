@entity1 attorney general @entity0 faces hostile fire from @entity3 and the mass media since news emerged that his @entity6 spied on reporters from at least two press outlets while tracing the sources of national security leaks			1
the @entity1 @entity12 's @entity11 prohibits the federal government from interfering with the @entity14 as tempers flare among the @entity17 press corps and @entity18 sharpen their knives for attorney general @entity0 , the @entity6 has scheduled a second sortie in its charm offensive meant to soften reporters ' icy stares			1
the @entity6 will host a ' policy meeting ' on tuesday for publishers and general counsels of news organizations , in the hope of stemming the tide of outrage from journalists angered over what they see as the federal government 's intrusion into protected free - speech territory			1
the afternoon meeting , according to the invitation , is ' part of the attorney general 's review of existing @entity6 guidelines governing investigations that involve the news media			1
' it is ' one of a series of meetings with media and other organizations that the attorney general is conducting , ' @entity6 said , ' as part of the policy review directed by the president			1
' @entity54 emerged in may that @entity0 's agency secretly obtained phone records and emails from @entity58 and @entity54 journalists , in investigations targeting national security leaks			1
neither news outlet was notified that the government was snooping on its personnel			0
reactions from the establishment news media in @entity17 have ranged from annoyance to outrage , with the perceived threat to @entity11 press rights bringing a new level of aggression from many reporters about the other scandals facing the @entity77 administration			2
when @entity79 inquired about the tuesday meeting , @entity6 staff initially insisted via email that it would be an ' off the record policy meeting			1
' but @entity0 's chief of staff , @entity84 , later softened that stand in a phone call with @entity79			1
@entity88 press secretary @entity87 offered no direct defense of the @entity6 of attorney general @entity0 on monday , but quoted the @entity88 chief of staff doing so in a @entity92 article @entity94 ( @entity95 ) , @entity17 bureau chief at @entity58 , saw phone records from 20 of her employees fall into the federal government 's hands			1
the @entity6 also seized @entity54 reporter @entity100 's private emails and some of his parents ' private communications ' i want to clarify a little bit , ' she said			2
' this " off - the - record / on - the - record " thing has taken on a life of its own			2
' ' we do n't want to say it 's on the record , ' she explained , ' because we would have cameras rolling and we would n't have a candid exchange			2
' two similar meetings , held may 30 and 31 with news editors and @entity17 bureau chiefs , were also originally framed as strictly ' off the record , ' a journalistic classification that would prohibit reporters from writing or broadcasting about anything that happened , or even about who was in attendance			0
the first ten amendments to the @entity12 , drafted march 4 , 1789 , are known as the @entity126			0
what we know as the @entity11 was actually the third one listed			0
it includes the demand that ' @entity3 shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ... ' but after pressure from some media outlets last week and a widespread boycott , the @entity6 adjusted that demand , permitting reporters to report generally on the substance of the friday meeting , while still insisting that no participants could be quoted directly			1
that placed the @entity77 administration in the unconventional and potentially embarrassing position of promising to guarantee press freedoms during a meeting whose participants were essentially sworn to secrecy			0
@entity0 , the @entity150 reported unironically , ' said officials would seek procedural and possibly legislative changes to protect journalists ’ first amendment rights			2
... the 90 - minute meeting was attended by a small group of journalists after several news organizations objected to the @entity6 ’s insistence that it be held off the record			1
the participants , however , reached an agreement with the @entity6 under which they could describe what occurred during the meeting in general terms			2
' ' we did n't want , especially last week when tempers were high , for there to be a transcription , ' @entity84 said monday			0
rep. @entity170 said sunday morning on @entity171 that ' it would be kind to say [ @entity0 ] misled @entity3 ' about his agency 's criminal investigations targeting journalists about tuesday 's meeting , she counseled that @entity0 is ' okay with people reporting on their own participation ' - but not in a self - promoting manner			1
the attorney general , @entity84 said , hopes not to ' lose the opportunity to have a meaningful policy engagement			2
' ' we do n't want to box anyone in , ' she continued			0
' but we also do n't want to create a big thing if someone reports on it and writes , " can you believe that stupid question that was asked ? " ' ' i know it 's a gray area , this off - the - record description , ' @entity84 said			1
' but that would be our preference			0
we 're trying to have some integrity in the policy process with an idea exchange			0
' tuesday 's session is not going to be the same ' as those held last week , she added			0
' this is publishers and general counsels , with the expectation that their perspectives will be different from [ those of ] bureau chiefs			0
' @entity0 's hold on his position in @entity17 is progressively more tenuous with each week			2
he personally approved a search warrant application for emails and phone records belonging to @entity54 reporter @entity100 , telling a federal judge that his status as a potential criminal co-conspirator trumped the government 's legal requirement to alert @entity54 in advance or negotiate with the leading cable news network			0
the attorney general also , however , told the @entity224 during a may 15 hearing that , ' with regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material , that is not something i ’ve ever been involved in , heard of or would think would be a wise policy			1
' the @entity1 @entity6 will be the scene of tuesday 's meeting , which @entity79 will attend			1
the agency is under fire for secretly obtaining two months of phone records of @entity58 reporters and both phone records and emails of @entity54 reporter @entity100 rep. @entity244 , a @entity245 @entity18 who chairs that committee , has confirmed that he is investigating @entity0 's testimony to determine whether he committed perjury			0
rep. @entity170 , who chairs the @entity250 , said sunday on @entity171 that ' it would be kind to say he misled @entity3			0
' ' it would be less kind and more accurate to say that would rise to be a lie by most people ’s standards			0
' the @entity6 does n't see it that way			0
' the attorney general ’s testimony concerning the potential prosecution of a member of the press , ' a spokesperson said , ' was accurate and consistent with the facts ' related to that leak case			1
federal prosecutors , the spokesperson continued , never ' sought approval to bring criminal charges against the reporter			0
' rep. @entity244 ( r ) , chairman of the @entity224 , has raised the specter of a perjury charge as one possible outcome of a congressional investigation into @entity276 testimony @entity88 chief of staff @entity278 defended @entity0 in a statement saturday to the @entity92			2
@entity0 , he said through a spokesman , “ has the intellect , experience and integrity to efficiently run the @entity6 and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the @entity1 people			1
' asked monday during a scheduled briefing for a comment on @entity0 's ability to remain in his job , @entity88 press secretary @entity87 referred reporters to @entity278 's statement , which he said ' spoke for all of us ' in the @entity88			1
' i could n't say it any better , ' @entity87 said .			0

first meetings were targeted by angry boycotts after journalists were told they could n't report on them
@entity0 is beset with scandal upon scandal and a press corps that 's outraged over government encroachment on @entity11 rights
@entity88 continues to stand by *embattled* attorney general
@entity79 will attend tuesday meeting after @entity6 offers *assurances* that ' off - the - record ' rules no longer apply
