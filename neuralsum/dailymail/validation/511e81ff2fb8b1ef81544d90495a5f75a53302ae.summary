former prime minister @entity0 , right , has given the @entity1 more than £ 100,000 in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with @entity3 , left ‘ as one of our key seat candidates , you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face , but i have every confidence that with your drive , determination and organisational skills , you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government			1
’ @entity1 indicated that mr @entity0 will also play a role in the election campaign , despite having made clear that he disapproves of mr @entity3 ’s left - wing stance			1
the donation represents a relatively modest gesture from mr @entity0 , whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to £ 100million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high - profile property deals			1
the source of the cash is likely to provoke unease among some @entity59 , given controversy over mr @entity0 ’s dealings with dictatorships such as @entity63 , and the fact that he remains under the shadow of the @entity67 inquiry into the @entity69 war , which is due to be published after the election			0

asked if he meant a @entity103 win , mr @entity0 replied : ‘ yes , that is what happens			0
’ he ‘ clarified ’ his comments the next day , saying he had been ‘ misinterpreted ’ and that he wanted and expected mr @entity3 to seize power			0
a @entity1 spokesman last night welcomed mr @entity0 ’s intervention , adding : ‘ we ’re delighted that @entity0 has given so generously to the local campaigns in the battleground seats our party is targeting at this general election			1
‘ our campaign is not based on big posters , talking over the heads of voters , or the sound and fury of @entity122 politics			0
