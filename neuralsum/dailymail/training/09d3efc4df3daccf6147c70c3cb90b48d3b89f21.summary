billowing high into the sky , this volcanic ash cloud - and the lightning around it - is something to behold			1
an eruption of the @entity6 volcano in central @entity7 is pictured here in all it 's glory by @entity7 photographer @entity10			1
his stunning snaps show forks of volcanic lightning to create a light show that truly drives home @entity17 ’s terrifying splendour			1
mr @entity10 's pictures give a spectacular view of the erupting volcano in central @entity7 @entity22 lights up the sky as the volcanic eruption below creates a spectacular effect light show : the @entity6 volcano in central @entity7 is pictured in all it 's glory by @entity7 photographer @entity10 @entity28 - inspiring : a giant plume of smoke billows out from the volcano in @entity7 this particular volcanic eruption began in june 2011			1
mr @entity10 was there with his trusty @entity34 to capture the action			2
the eruption was in the @entity6 volcanic chain , about 575 miles south of the capital , @entity39			1
the chain last saw a major eruption in 1960			0
as a precaution , the government evacuated 3,500 people from the surrounding area			0
it was the latest in a series of volcanic eruptions in @entity7 in recent years			1
@entity7 's @entity50 volcano erupted spectacularly in 2008 for the first time in thousands of years , spewing molten rock and a vast cloud of ash that reached the stratosphere			1
the ash also swelled a nearby river and ravaged a nearby town of the same name			0
the ash cloud from @entity50 coated towns in @entity62 and was visible from space			0
@entity7 's @entity65 volcano , one of @entity67 's most active , erupted in 2008 and 2009			1
@entity7 's chain of about 2,000 volcanoes is the world 's second largest after @entity71			2
some 50 to 60 are on record as having erupted , and 500 are potentially active			0
volcanic lightning - also known as a dirty thunderstorm - is a weather phenomenon that occurs when lightning is produced in a volcanic plume volcanic lightning - also known as a dirty thunderstorm - is a weather phenomenon that occurs when lightning is produced in a volcanic plume			1
the little - understood storms may be sparked when rock fragments , ash , and ice particles in the plume collide to produce static charges just as ice particles collide to create charge in regular thunderstorms			0
in a study carried out by the state engineering university @entity93 , researchers used radio waves to detect the previously unknown type of lightning as it flashed from the crater of @entity100 's @entity99 volcano			2
the little - understood storms may be sparked when rock fragments , ash , and ice particles in the plume collide this particular volcanic eruption began in june 2011			2
mr @entity10 was there with his trusty @entity34 to capture the action co-author @entity108 said : ' during the eruption there were lots of small lightning [ bolts ] or big sparks that probably came from the mouth of the crater and entered the [ ash ] column coming out of the volcano			1
' so we saw a lot of electrical activity during the eruption and even some small flashes going from the top of the volcano up into the cloud			2
that has n't been noticed before			0
' the new evidence suggests that the eruption produced a large amount of electric charge			0
' we 're not sure if it comes out of the volcano or if it is created just afterwards			0
one of the things we have to find out is what 's generating this charge , ' @entity108 added			0
researchers believe eruptions produce high levels of electric charge which contribute to the light show			0

@entity7 photographer @entity10 captured an eruption of @entity6 volcano @entity7
his stunning snaps show forks of volcanic lightning that are sometimes called a ' dirty thunderstorm '
