@entity0 acknowledges that revolvers have been replaced by high - capacity semi-automatic pistols such as the @entity59 series when it comes to self defense , often taking the place of ' second - choice ' among potential gun owners			1
however large caliber still have a dedicated following , with models such as the @entity68 - which fires an even larger bullet than the backpack cannon - being the most popular example			1
but while they may be toted by action film heroes , the reality is that large caliber weapons such as the .460 revolver are largely confined to target shooting			0

the company suggests that avid outdoorsmen could carry the gun in their backpack in case their main armament fails			0
and the huge caliber of the revolver means it could also be used to fend off bears			0
the @entity6 comes with a shock absorbing handle , making it easier to fire repeatedly high visibility sights on the top of the handgun allow for better accuracy when targeting smaller objects the pistol packs a huge punch , and you 'll need strong fingers to pull back the massive trigger the firearm 's 3 - inch chambers hold five massive rounds , including the one pictured here in addition to the plethora of attachments that aid targeting and shooting , the gun is also compatible with several forms of ammo , able to carry .454 @entity115 rounds and @entity117 ammo , both of which pack a significant punch			1
@entity37 gave a favorable review to the handgun , saying ' there is still a place for weapons like this especially if you like camping where the critters are big enough to eat you			1
' at $ 1,200 ( £ 730 ) the gun is much more expensive than your average handgun			0
