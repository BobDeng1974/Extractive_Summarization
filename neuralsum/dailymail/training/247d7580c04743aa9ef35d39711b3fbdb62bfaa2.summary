a woman has died after apparently being bitten by the @entity2 ’s most venomous spider , in what could be the country ’s first such death			1
according to her family , grandmother @entity6 fell ill after being bitten on the finger by a false widow spider			1
she had to have the end of the finger amputated after weeks of ‘ absolute agony ’ , her daughter said , but the 60 - year - old ’s health deteriorated further and she died in hospital on friday			1
if proved , she will have been the first person to have died in @entity29 as a result of a spider bite			1
false widows – cousins of the infamous black widow spider – give very painful bites which often swell as the body tries to combat the venom			1
some people have reported being left unconscious by the bites , but to date there have never been any confirmed deaths from them			0
about the size of a 10p piece , with a bulbous body and white markings , the false widow spider is now a fairly common sight in people ’s homes , where it seeks refuge in autumn as the weather turns			1
some false widows are native to @entity29 , but the most venomous , the noble false widow , was first imported in fruit crates from the @entity53 more than a century ago			1
since then , they have spread northwards from the @entity54			0
mrs @entity6 first went to her gp after being bitten in her home in @entity58 , @entity59 , a month ago			2
it is believed she was told that , although painful , the bite was highly unlikely to cause serious problems			2
mrs @entity6 was bitten on the tip of her finger by a false widow spider , pictured , a cousin of the venemous black widow spider but rather than subsiding , the pain intensified , and she ended up being admitted to hospital			1
last saturday , mrs @entity6 had an operation to have the top of the bitten finger amputated			1
however , her condition went downhill until she was left ‘ confused and hallucinating ’ , according to her family			0
one of @entity77 ’s four daughters , @entity78 , 43 , said she had been left ‘ numb and in total shock ’ by her mother ’s sudden death			0
@entity82 described mrs @entity6 as a friendly woman who helped out many people			0
one said : ‘ i am devastated , gutted			0
she was genuine , warm and caring – and a good friend			0
’ her death comes just weeks after @entity87 reported that one of the world ’s deadliest spiders , a @entity88 , was delivered hiding in a bunch of bananas to a @entity94 home by @entity95			0
after feeling unwell after being bitten , mrs @entity6 was admitted to the @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , pictured mrs @entity6 ’s family fear poor care at @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 , might have contributed to her death			2
in a @entity22 posting , mrs @entity78 , who runs a church - based breakfast and after - school club for children in @entity104 , claimed ward staff ‘ knew nothing ’ about the bite			2
she alleged they had not read her mother ’s gp notes in full , and wrote that she was ‘ unhappy with the lack of care and attention ’ given			0
the family will be meeting hospital managers this week to discuss the care @entity77 received and the possibility that the bite may have played a part in her death			2
a hospital spokesman said she could not make any comment about @entity77 ’s death for reasons of patient confidentiality			0
but she added : ‘ i can assure you that the case is being reviewed			0
’ earlier this year the @entity87 reported how a deadly spider was found in a bunch of bananas in a @entity95 delivery dr @entity132 , presenter of the @entity134 ’s @entity133 , said the noble false widow was the most venomous of false widows but the zoologist said this spider ’s bite was not in the same league as the black widow ’s			1
dr @entity132 said : ‘ its bite is about as bad as a bee sting			0
in the @entity2 , several people die of bee stings every year because they have an allergic reaction			1
but most of the stories in the press show evidence of tissue damage or necrosis and there is nothing in the false widow spider ’s venom that can do that			1
‘ when you see these cases of necrosis it ’s almost certainly down to a bacterial infection or something like that			0
’ dr @entity165 , a critical care consultant and chief executive of the charity @entity2 , said it was ‘ entirely plausible ’ that @entity77 had developed a secondary infection as a result of the bite .			2

had the end of her finger amputated after weeks of ' absolute agony '

investigations are under way to see if she is first person in @entity2 to die from a spider bite
