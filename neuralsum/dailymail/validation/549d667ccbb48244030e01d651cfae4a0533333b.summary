the parents of private @entity1 - who died from a gunshot wound at @entity3 - have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death the parents of a teenage @entity9 recruit who died from a gunshot wound at @entity3 have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death			1
private @entity1 , 18 , was one of four young soldiers who died in unexplained shootings at the @entity17 base between 1995 and 2002			1
after fighting for justice for 20 years , her parents won the right to hold a new inquest after @entity22 were forced to hand over tens of thousands of pages of previously concealed evidence			1
they believe the new documents could provide the truth behind how their daughter died after years of speculation , including fears she was murdered or driven to commit suicide after being sexually assaulted			1
it is understood the evidence could quash @entity34 claims that @entity35 took her own life and could lead to a criminal trial			2
but now the police force – which has repeatedly come under fire for their botched investigation into the deaths – is trying to push back the case by years , the family claimed			1
the force argued in a hearing earlier this month that @entity35 ’s inquest should be heard alongside inquests into the deaths of the other three soldiers – a process which could take another three years			1
@entity53 , 66 , and @entity54 , 63 , @entity1 ’s parents , from @entity56 on the @entity59 - @entity58 border , said : ‘ three weeks ago we thought we were on the way to justice			1
‘ then the police come back to court with a ludicrous suggestion which would create huge delays , not only for us but for all of the families			2
‘ you ’ve got four kids who die on the same site and the police link them all together , even though two of them died almost seven years apart			1
‘ @entity22 never intended there to be a thorough investigation and they are trying to halt the case again			2
’ @entity35 , 18 , was found dead in a copse of trees at the base after she had been on sentry duty in november 1995			1
@entity22 handed the matter to the @entity9 , which treated it as suicide			0
private @entity83 , 20 , from @entity84 , @entity85 , was also found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in june 1995			1
and in september 2001 , 17 - year - old @entity88 , from @entity89 , @entity90 , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head			1
private @entity93 lost his life in suspicious circumstances at @entity3 in march 2002			1
( clockwise from top left ) private @entity93 , private @entity35 , private @entity88 and private @entity83 all died at @entity3 the soldiers ’ families have refused to accept that all four committed suicide , accusing the @entity9 of covering up bullying and abuse			1
retired company direction , mr @entity35 , said he believed the new evidence , which he has seen , could lead to a criminal investigation , adding : ‘ i am fighting to find out everything i possibly can about my daughter ’s death			1
‘ i ’ve never said she was murdered , nor that she was sexually assaulted			0
the problem has been that someone has never allowed me to see the evidence			0
‘ i refuse to speculate on what happened to her because frankly it is too awful to think about			0
’ he added : ‘ my suspicion regarding what happened to my daughter was made clear when i wrote to the @entity34 shortly after her death asking if finger prints had been taken off the rifle			2
‘ they took five months to reply and then said there had been no point taking fingerprints because it was a pooled weapon			0
‘ there is quite simply no evidence that connects @entity1 ’s death with the rifle found near her body			1
finger prints were not taken , rounds remaining in the rifle were inexplicably destroyed and bullet fragmentation was allegedly not collected at the post mortem			0
’ concerns about the deaths led police to investigate in 2002 , but the force refused the families access to their files of evidence			2
after @entity141 threatened legal action , @entity22 caved in and handed over 44 volumes of statements , notes and photographs in 2012			0
the material contained ‘ significant forensic evidence that was never properly examined and suggestions important witnesses lied ’ at the first inquest , said @entity141			2
but the force has still not handed over 25 per cent of the files on the death of @entity35			1
mr @entity35 added : ‘ if we can make a case with 75 per cent of the files , one must wonder what else is to come and why exactly it has taken @entity22 almost ten years to hand it over			1
‘ @entity22 have let us down over and over again			0
they let us down in 1995 when they ignored our daughter ’s death by leaving it to the army			2
‘ they let us down a second time when they conducted a sloppy investigation in 2002 , which left huge questions … not least of which was they did n’t allow the dignity of those poor kids to have individual investigations			0
’ @entity35 , 18 , was found dead in a copse of trees at the base ( pictured ) after she had been on sentry duty in november 1995 speaking yesterday , @entity177 , legal officer for @entity141 , said : ‘ @entity53 and @entity54 have suffered all these years and the case should be dealt with separately as that is what these young people and their families deserve			1
‘ @entity22 have repeatedly refused to give access to the materials held by them to the families all these years			0
‘ that it should be @entity22 that is again standing in the way of – or significantly delaying – justice is disgraceful			2
’ they said it was ‘ only in their interest ’ , not in the interest of the families , and said their ‘ sudden request for an adjournment ’ was shocking			0
the @entity197 ruled there was an ‘ insufficiency of inquiry ’ at the original 1995 inquest into @entity35 ’ death which lasted just an hour			1
two judges quashed the controversial open verdict last year - a dramatic breakthrough in the family ’s 19 - year fight for justice			1
miss @entity177 added : ‘ in july 2014 @entity53 and @entity54 finally got what they had been fighting for for 20 years when the @entity197 agreed to order a fresh inquest following the disclosure of thousands of pages of new material			1
’ a hearing was held earlier this month to set a date for the inquest later this year , but lawyers acting on behalf of the police called for it be stayed until all of the other cases were prepared			1
the family are now waiting to hear back from the coroner into whether the case will be suspended until such a time			2
‘ this is a process that could take many , many months and probably years as they have n’t even completed disclosure and there are many thousands of pages to go through concerning all 4 deaths ’ , @entity141 said			0
‘ @entity53 and @entity54 ’s case is ready to go now			0
@entity22 are being obstructive by trying to delay this and they have not been there for the family			0
it is not in the family interest			0
‘ these deserve separate individual careful inquests			0
‘ it may well be that evidence comes to light			0
the concern has always been that they ( @entity22 ) were predisposed to find suicide and until we dig into the heart of this case the family will never know what happened to their daughter			2
’ the soldiers ’ families have refused to accept that all four committed suicide at the barracks ( pictured ) , accusing the @entity9 of covering up bullying and abuse ‘ i ca n’t explain how angry i am , i find it so upsetting ’ , mr @entity35 said			2
‘ it is such an hypocrisy , @entity259 pretending that they have the families interests at heart when they have abjectly refused to allow us disclosure for so many years			0
’ an inside source claimed @entity22 were ‘ lumping ’ the cases together to ‘ soften the blow ’ to the force by taking ‘ one bad hit at once ’ , rather than four separate hits			0
the source added : ‘ there is a fear that it is going to be easier to mask the individual failings if the cases are all lumped together			0
’ it has since emerged that even the families of @entity83 and @entity93 do not want all the inquests to be treated as one case			0
mr @entity35 added : ‘ i ca n’t understand for the life of me how @entity17 police think by dictating the pace of this they are doing the families a favour			2
‘ the suggestion that we will benefit from this is ridiculous			0
‘ @entity22 are holding all of this up , we are ready to go , and the @entity34 is ready to go			0
’ a @entity22 spokesman said : ‘ @entity22 is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which pte @entity1 died			1
‘ at the pre inquest review @entity293 was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of pte @entity1 , pte @entity83 , @entity298 and pte @entity93 , together or individually			1
‘ this was raised as a matter for consideration and @entity22 will fully support the coronial process			0
