by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:01 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 16:13 est , 23 may 2013 president @entity3 on thursday defended @entity5 's controversial drone attacks as legal , effective and a necessary linchpin in an evolving @entity5 counterterrorism policy , saying , ' simply put , these strikes save lives			1
' but he acknowledged the targeted strikes are no ' cure - all ' and said he is haunted by the civilians unintentionally killed			2
the president also announced a renewed push to close the @entity16 detention center in @entity17 , including lifting a moratorium on prisoner transfers to @entity20			0
however , shutting the prison will still require help from @entity23 reluctant to back @entity3 's call to move some detainees to @entity5 prisons and try them in civilian courts			1
@entity3 framed his address as an attempt to redefine the nature and scope of terror threats facing the @entity5 , noting the weakening of @entity34 and the impending end of the @entity5 war in @entity37			1
' what we can do — what we must do — is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger , and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold , all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend			0
' since taking office , @entity3 's counterterrorism strategy has increasingly relied on the use of strikes by unmanned spy drones , particularly in @entity71 and @entity20			1
the highly secretive program has faced criticism from congressional lawmakers who have questioned its scope and legality			2
the president , in his most expansive public discussion on drones , defended their targeted killings as both effective and legal			2
he acknowledged the civilian deaths that sometimes result — a consequence that has angered many of the countries where the @entity5 seeks to combat extremism — and said he grapples with that trade - off			0
' for me , and those in my chain of command , these deaths will haunt us as long as we live , ' he said			0
before any strike , he said , ' there must be near - certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured — the highest standard we can set			0
' ahead of the address , @entity3 signed new ' presidential policy guidelines ' aimed at illustrating more clearly to @entity100 and the public the standards the @entity5 applies before carrying out drone attacks the @entity104 is still expected to maintain control of the drone program in @entity20 , as well as in @entity71 's tribal areas ahead of the address , @entity3 signed new ' presidential policy guidelines ' aimed at illustrating more clearly to @entity100 and the public the standards the @entity5 applies before carrying out drone attacks			1
officials said the guidelines include not using strikes when the targeted people can be captured , either by the @entity5 or a foreign government , relying on drones only when the target poses an ' imminent ' threat and establishing a preference for giving the military control of the drone program			1
however , the @entity104 is still expected to maintain control of the drone program in @entity20 , as well as in @entity71 's tribal areas , given the concern that @entity34 may return in greater numbers as @entity5 troops draw down in @entity37			1
the military and the @entity104 currently work side by side in @entity20 , with the @entity104 flying its drones over the northern region out of a covert base in @entity129 , and the military flying its unmanned aerial vehicles from @entity132			2
in @entity71 alone , up to 3,336 people have been killed by the unmanned aircraft since 2003 , according to the @entity135 which maintains a database of the strikes			2
@entity3 's advisers said the new guidelines will effectively limit the number of drone strikes in terror zones and pointed to a future decline of attacks against extremists in @entity37 as the war there winds down next year			1
but strikes elsewhere will continue			0
the guidelines will also apply to strikes against both foreigners and @entity5 citizens abroad			0
on the eve of the president 's speech , the administration revealed for the first time that a fourth @entity5 citizen had been killed in secretive drone strikes abroad			1
the killings of three other @entity5 in counterterror operations since 2009 were widely known before a letter from attorney general @entity163 to @entity165 chairman @entity164 acknowledged the four deaths			0
in that letter , @entity163 said only one of the @entity5 citizens killed in counterterror operations beyond war zones — @entity170 , who had ties to at least three attacks planned or carried out on @entity5 soil — was specifically targeted by @entity5 forces			0
he said the other three @entity5 were not targeted in the @entity5 strikes .			0

@entity3 made the remarks in a sweeping speech on *counterterorrism* policy at the @entity55
said drone program could use more oversight
since taking office , @entity3 's counterterrorism strategy has increasingly relied on the use of strikes by unmanned spy drones
