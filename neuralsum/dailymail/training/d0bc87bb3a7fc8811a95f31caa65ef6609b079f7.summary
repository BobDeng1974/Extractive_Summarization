a mother under investigation for letting her two young children walk a mile home from the park by themselves has spoken out to publicly defend ' free - range parenting '			1
@entity6 appeared on the today show monday morning with her children @entity9 , 10 , and @entity10 , six			1
just before @entity12 , the two children were walking about a mile home from a park near their @entity16 home when police officers stopped them and asked why they were alone			1
the officers escorted the @entity6 children home , launching a @entity21 investigation into @entity6 and her husband @entity22 's competence as parents			1
but mrs @entity6 does n't think she they did anything wrong in giving her children a little independence			1
it was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago , ' she said on today			0
free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '			1
' helicopter parents ' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring , micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe			0
however critics believe this creates under - confident , over-reliant children , while also causing the parents stress			2
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own			1
instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe , the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time , and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves			0
mrs @entity6 admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before , but says she was n't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues			1
' well i 've walked home from school before			0
not with my sister , but i 've done it alone , ' 10 - year - old @entity9 said			0
' we walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block			2
the @entity96 describe themselves as ' free - range parents ' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world			1
usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads ' i 'm not lost			0
i 'm a free range kid ' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house			2
someone saw the two kids walking alone and called 911 , and about three police officers stopped the children as they were about halfway home			2
while mrs @entity6 says her children assured the officers that they knew where they were going , the police escorted them home to talk to her husband , @entity126			1
mrs @entity6 was n't home at the time , but says the officers were aggressive to her husband , and that her son called her crying , fearing that he would be arrested			1
he sees three police officers with our kids			0
and they did n't really explain what was going on so it was kind of uncomfortable			0
he said he felt they were really aggressive , ' she said			0
journey : on december 20 , the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents when @entity21 later showed up at the house , she says they threatened her husband if he did n't sign a form , promising to supervise his children at all times until a follow up appointment			1
' he said i do n't want to sign this without talking to a lawyer or talking to my wife			0
and she said if you do n't sign this we 're going to take the children right now and she called the police , ' she said			2
the @entity96 are still under investigation by @entity21			0
mrs @entity6 says she understands why other parents would n't let their children walk alone , but does n't believe her decision to give her children more freedom makes her a bad mother			1
' i think what 's really unfortunate is we 're really overestimating the danger and underestimating our children			2
' and in fact what 's really sad is that by driving our kids instead of letting them walk , we 're actually endangering them more because the number one cause of death for children this age are actually car accidents			2
' so letting children walk is not only good for their health , it 's actually safer than driving			0
' parenting choice : mrs @entity6 ( pictured ) says she and husband @entity22 often let their children @entity9 , ten , and @entity10 , six , walk alone to teach them about the world play time : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity193 ( right ) pictured with their two children at the park the @entity6 children pictured outside the @entity198 in @entity199 this month @entity193 and @entity6 have yet to learn whether any further action will be taken against them , but say whatever happens next , the experience has left them furious			1
mrs @entity6 previously told the @entity205 : ' i think what @entity21 considered neglect , we felt was an essential part of growing up and maturing			2
' we feel we ’re being bullied into a point of view about child - rearing that we strongly disagree with			0
' a @entity21 spokeswoman told the @entity205 that they could n't comment on individual cases , but pointed to state law which says children under eight must be left with a responsible person aged at least 13			0
police said they could not find information on the case , but a spokeswoman said that when concerns are reported , ' we have a responsibility as part of our duty to check on people ’s welfare			0
