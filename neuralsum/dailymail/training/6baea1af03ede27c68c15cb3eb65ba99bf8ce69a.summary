by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity3 ’s attempts to engage with @entity5 ’s grassroots have backfired – after they branded his policies ‘ pathetic ’ , ‘ bland ’ and even ‘ catastrophic ’			1
the comments were posted on @entity5 ’s your @entity9 website , which was set up in 2012 to gather honest views from members on what should be in the party manifesto			1
but instead it has attracted a host of highly critical views about the @entity20 ’s current pitch to voters			0
labour in @entity34 , @entity35 , criticised the stance on welfare reform as ‘ pathetic ’ , and @entity5 ’s association in @entity39 labelled the party ’s education plans ‘ too narrow and too timid ’			1
the website was launched two years ago , and mr @entity3 said it would ‘ give a voice to members ’			2
it claims to be the ‘ online home of @entity5 ideas and policy development ’ – and tells contributors : ‘ by joining in you can play a part in developing our next manifesto			2
’ the @entity55 seized on the comments , saying they showed @entity3 was ‘ just not up to it ’			2
but a @entity5 spokesman branded reports of the comments ‘ desperate rubbish ’			1
details of the comments emerged as a former @entity5 advisor launched a highly critical attack on @entity5 ’s high command over its failure to accept public spending cuts – and said time was ‘ running out ’ for the party to present a vision for how it would run @entity9			1
@entity72 , a former adviser to @entity73 and @entity74 said @entity5 ‘ palpably lacks a coherent governing vision for an age of austerity ’			0
humbled : but a @entity5 spokesman said highlighting the comments was a ' baseless smear ' by the @entity55 writing on the @entity82 website he said : ‘ @entity3 ’s ideological instinct is to reassert the case for interventionist government			1
‘ his political antennae tell him this is not sustainable in an era of rising public deficits and ballooning national debt			0
‘ the leader knows there can be no return to post-war ‘ tax and spend ’ social democracy , yet he is trapped by antipathy to the new @entity5 project from spelling out a non-statist alternative			0
‘ he faces a fork in the road , but is reluctant to choose : as a consequence , @entity5 palpably lacks a coherent governing vision for an age of austerity			0
with nine months to go until a general election , time is running out for @entity107 ’s opposition			0
’ the your @entity9 website collected comments from constituency @entity5 groups across the country			1
the party in @entity113 warned many of its members found proposals ‘ simply too vague ’ , while the association in @entity119 , @entity117 warned that the draft education policy agenda ‘ lacks vision , strategy and coherence ’			0
@entity5 ’s association in @entity39 labelled the @entity5 ’s education plans ‘ too narrow and too timid ’ @entity5 member and policy forum member @entity28 attacked the party ’s ‘ hugely disappointing , if not catastrophic ’ position on housing			1
she wrote : ‘ @entity3 acknowledged that we have a housing crisis ... he said that to solve the crisis a future @entity5 government would ensure that by the end of the next parliament i.e by 2020 @entity9 would be building 200,000 homes a year			1
this response is totally inadequate			0
’ @entity139 , conservative mp for @entity140 , said : ‘ this is pretty damning stuff			0
first it was @entity5 mps and councillors telling us that @entity3 is just not up to it , now @entity5 ’s grassroots have publicly criticised @entity3 ’s weak leadership and political gimmicks which offer no long - term solutions for hardworking families across the country			2
‘ the truth is , only the @entity153 team can offer a long term economic plan that will secure a brighter future for @entity9 people and their families			0
’ a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ this is desperate rubbish , pumped out by a @entity153 who ’ll try anything to distract from their failure			1
‘ this is a public website where everyone can contribute and people have done so in their thousands			0
comments are n’t @entity5 policy			2
‘ while the @entity55 try to sell their baseless smears , the @entity5 will get on with setting out a positive vision for @entity5 ’s future			2
