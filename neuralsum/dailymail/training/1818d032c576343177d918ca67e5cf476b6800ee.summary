by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 23 september 2012 updated : 05:07 est , 24 september 2012 crammed into small boxes , their heads wedged through tiny holes , the monkeys undoubtedly look terrified			1
around them , men in rubber overalls and gas masks arrange a semi-circle of boxes containing guinea pigs on the deck of a sloping pontoon			1
after the boxes have been laid out , the men disappear below the deck of a ship , and for a while , nothing happens			1
these scenes , which have just been released , appear in a gruesome film showing secret germ warfare experiments on animals carried out by @entity39 government scientists sixty years ago			1
the experiments , which ran from may to september 1952 off the coast of the @entity26 in the @entity42 , exposed nearly 3,500 guinea pigs and 83 @entity45 monkeys to deadly germs such as bubonic plague			1
codenamed @entity48 , the secret experiments were part of our nascent biological warfare programme , which at the time was deemed as important as the development of nuclear weapons			1
acting in the belief that the @entity58 were producing bacteriological bombs , scientists from @entity61 laboratory in @entity63 were briefed to devise similar weapons that could be used in retaliation against a @entity67 germ warfare strike			1
although the existence of the 47 - minute film has been known about for many years , it is now available for the world to see on the video - sharing website @entity73 , thanks to the efforts of @entity76 , 58 , an @entity77 from @entity78 in @entity79			1
trials : a rhesus macaque monkey and five guinea pigs await their fates on the deck of the pontoon scientists set out the animals in cages on the deck of the pontoon before a small bomb containing bacteriological agents is detonated ‘ this is the only film like it in the world , ’ says mr @entity76 , who lobbied the @entity92 to get the film released			1
‘ as far as i know , it ’s the only film that shows animals being exposed to deadly pathogens			1
’ the @entity92 was reluctant to release the film , and it is not hard to see why as it is disturbing viewing			1
many of the monkeys and guinea pigs exposed to the germs died within a few days , while any that survived were killed and dissected so their organs could be studied for the effects of the deadly germs			1
above all , it is the sight of the monkeys ’ almost human faces that make the film so shocking			2
‘ although we see the tests are being carried out on animals , ’ says mr @entity76 , ‘ when one sees the monkeys , one ca n’t help but empathise , and realise that these weapons were being designed to be used against people ’			2
very few of those who took part in @entity48 are still alive			1
one of the men who can testify to the truth of what happened is @entity125 , 82 , who was a petty officer on board the ship the @entity128 , which housed the animals and scientists			2
as the ship ’s writer , responsible for sending back reports to the @entity133 , mr @entity125 well understood the aims of the project			2
many of the other sailors only had a vague idea of the experiments being carried out on the nearby pontoon			1
the terrified monkey are sealed in small boxes in the hold of the pontoon before being brought up on deck in batches to exposed to deadly germs fate : many of the monkeys and guinea pigs exposed to the germs died within a few days , while any that survived were killed and dissected so their organs could be studied ‘ we were simply told that we were going on a germ warfare trial , ’ says mr @entity125			1
‘ but we were not told where we were going			2
’ however , the men were informed that taking part was not compulsory			2
‘ right from the beginning , they let anybody know that if they objected to the experiments being carried out on animals , then they would be allowed to drop out and there would be no stain on your record , ’ says mr @entity125			2
‘ to my knowledge , nobody dropped out			2
you have to remember these were different times and animal welfare was not such a priority			2
’ mr @entity125 also says most saw the necessity for the development of a new type of weapon of mass destruction			0
‘ it was the middle of the @entity182 , ’ he says			0
‘ you realised that it had to be done			0
@entity184 had served in the war , or , like me , had been brought up during the war			0
we had seen the atomic bomb , and this was another type of warfare			0
‘ in theory , it was going to be a lot more deadly than nuclear warfare			0
a nuclear bomb can take out a city			0
germ warfare can take out a country			0
’ the utmost care was taken to keep the experiments safe and wind conditions were carefully monitored before each detonation to avoid spreading the germs inland			0
a scientist prepares for an experiment			0
around 3,500 guinea pigs and 83 @entity45 monkeys were exposed to deadly germs however , there was one accident that could have had disastrous @entity212 the last day of the programme , a trawler , the @entity215 , sailed through the path of a bubonic plague experiment			0
‘ the trawler was tailed by two naval vessels for 21 days , waiting for any distress call , ’ says bacteriological warfare expert dr @entity218 of @entity220 , @entity221			1
‘ when none came , almost all records of the incident were burnt			0
’ indeed , the crew members only heard about their exposure to the plague when the official records were opened 50 years later			0
when the scientists involved in the trials returned to @entity61 , they judged the experiments to have been a success			0
‘ new ground has been broken with plague trials , ’ read a report			0
but the findings of @entity48 were never meant to come to the public ’s attention			1
if the experiments ever did come to light , the then prime minister , @entity243 , had prepared a statement justifying what many would have regarded as unethical			0
‘ the possibility that bacteria may be used in a future war can not be overlooked , ’ the statement read			0
‘ the researches ... are being pursued so that defensive measures may be taken			0
the experiments now taking place form part of these researches			1
’ today the @entity92 has sought to distance itself from the experiments			0
it says it does not recognise the treatment of animals as seen in the film as being in line with modern ethical scientific conduct			0
although it is unlikely such creatures are today being exposed to deadly pathogens in the pursuit of military advantage , the release of the film is a chilling reminder of the disquieting lengths @entity39 went to develop perhaps the most deadly weapons the world had ever seen .			1
