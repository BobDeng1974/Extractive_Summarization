by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 18:46 est , 9 september 2013 treated well : @entity0 had micrographic surgery after he cancer diagnosis there is an ever - widening variety of treatments for skin cancers – from lasers and light therapy , to creams , radiation and freezing			1
but one that is still proving most effective , according to experts , is also the most old - fashioned – and involves ‘ mapping ’ the tumours using a paper and pencil			1
the surgical technique , known as @entity20 , was first developed in the 1930s			0
i found out all about it when last year , a few months shy of my 40th birthday , i was diagnosed with a basal cell carcinoma ( @entity26 ) that developed in the centre of my forehead			1
i had a strange ‘ ulcer ’ that appeared from nowhere that would scab over but never fully heal			0
@entity30 was worried about it , so sought the help of my gp			0
it took a while to get a proper diagnosis because i do n’t fit the usual profiling			0
the risk of @entity39 increases with age , and they most commonly affect those over the age of 60			0
i do however have risk factors – i have fair skin and have spent time abroad			1
a biopsy finally confirmed the result			0
after coming to terms with a cancer diagnosis , which did hit me hard though i was quickly reassured that it was not a life - threatening form , i started to research the best treatment options available			1
as well as wanting the cancer gone , in truth i was also concerned about the size of the scar i would be left with			1
online , i discovered that during standard surgery , a 4mm margin is cut which would have left a significant mark on my face			1
it was during an appointment to discuss this with my gp that @entity66 surgery was first mentioned			1
he had also recently been diagnosed with a @entity26 , which accounts for 75 per cent of all skin cancers			1
@entity66 cures about 99 per cent of @entity39 when treated for the first time			1
the success rate drops to about 95 per cent for previously treated @entity71 that then return			1
and , according to consultant dermatological surgeon dr @entity78 , who heads up the country ’s largest @entity20 units at @entity81 in @entity82 : ‘ in areas like the nose , ears and eyelids it will give a better cosmetic outcome			0
’ the @entity66 procedure ( it ’s named after the surgeon who invented it , @entity66 ) begins with the removal of the visible portion of the skin cancer with a scalpel , along with a layer of surrounding skin			1
once a layer of tissue has been removed , a map , or drawing , of it and its orientation to the face is made on paper to serve as a guide to the precise location of the tumour			1
the tissue is processed using stains to help highlight any cancerous material , which the surgeon will then examine under the microscope			0
if cancer is still present in certain areas , the surgeon will then remove another layer of tissue with a scalpel			2
the process is repeated until all cancer cells have been removed and only healthy cells remain			2
it is only then that the wound is closed			0
the procedure , is performed using only local anaesthetic , and can take up to six hours , although most of the time is spent waiting for results rather than being operated on			0
not all patients will automatically be put forward for this treatment			2
there are only a small number of units performing @entity66 in the @entity125			1
@entity126 ’ , the largest provider , treated around 1,000 patients last year			2
there are about 113,000 new cases of skin cancer every year in the @entity125			1
the treatment is also suitable for another common type – squamous cell carcinoma , which accounts for 20 per cent of cases			1
@entity66 can even treat certain forms of melanoma , the deadliest skin cancer			1
depending on the diagnosis , the consultant may decide that a standard excision will have a higher chance of success without the long operative time and cost of @entity66			1
other options include radiotherapy , the use of topical creams such as @entity150 ; or @entity151 , which combines use of a special cream with exposure to a specific wavelength of light			0
however topical treatments are usually reserved for low - risk superficial tumours			2
high success rate : using pencil and paper to map out the tumours has proven to be one of the most successful way to treating skin cancer so what is it like ? the operation day itself is a long one			1
during my first session , the surgeon removed the lesion and a layer of surrounding tissue , cauterised and bandaged the area while i returned to the waiting room			0
once the anaesthetic was injected , the procedure was painless and relatively fast			0
i had about an hour ’s wait , in which i sat and read a magazine before being called back into theatre , where the surgeon explained there were two areas where cancer cells were still present			2
the most uncomfortable bit of the whole procedure was when the team cleaned the wound and injected it again ready for more surgery			2
the area was again cauterised , burnt with a heated instrument to stem the bleeding , and covered in a large plaster packed with gauze and i returned for my final wait			0
after another hour passed flicking through magazines , i was called into theatre by dr @entity78 who said that as the margins were now clear the wound could be closed			0
it was an indescribable relief to hear that the cancer had gone			2
then i had to get my brave face on for the final bit of surgery			2
more anaesthetic and a bit of tugging drew my skin together , and it took about three weeks for the wound to heal properly			2
four months on and the scar is about 3cm long			0
but people only notice it if i point it out			0
make - up and a newly adopted fringe certainly help , but it is a small price to pay for a face free from cancer			0
if i have learned anything from the experience it is this : skip the sunbed , wear sunscreen at all times , wear a hat and cover your shoulders in the sun. and if you notice a patch of skin or an ulcer that does n’t heal , report it to your gp			0
the sooner you catch a change , the better your chance of a full cure and less scarring .			0
