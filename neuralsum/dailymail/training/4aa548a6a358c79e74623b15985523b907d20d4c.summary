click here to see more of our brilliant @entity1 , including an impressive 25 - pass build - up for @entity5 's goal when @entity7 met @entity8 one sunday in late august for a coffee , there was only one question he wanted answering			1
did he have the hunger to play on a cold afternoon in the @entity12 , when the going was tough and the environment was unforgiving ? @entity16 ’s manager never had a concern about @entity8 ’s quality but he needed to see if the desire was still there			1
@entity8 has never given @entity7 a moment to think he made a wrong move but his decision was vindicated once again at blustery @entity24 , as his two goals inspired @entity16 to a comfortable 3 - 1 victory over @entity27			1
he may be 33 but he still has much to offer			0
‘ i like @entity8 when he is in that type of form , ’ said @entity7 , who saw @entity5 atone for the mistake that gifted @entity27 a goal by scoring @entity16 ’s second			1
‘ he can play anywhere			0
he brings real know - how and experience			2
sometimes , you want to develop young players			0
' but he can give them a lot of aspects technically , tactically and physically			0
there ’s few people who can teach things like @entity8 due to his experience			1
' everyone will speak about the goals but i was so pleased with the performance he had , his role off the ball and the way he worked hard for the team			2
‘ he has set real standards and i ’m really pleased			0
he has played two games in a week , but his performance was a real example			0
what an incredible professional to have in a dressing room full of young players			0
’ that point is key			0
some will carp and say @entity8 has thrived against a side who are heading back to the @entity127 but that overlooks the fact that he arrived on @entity129 as one of a select group who have won the @entity133 at two different clubs			1
the moment he walked into @entity136 , @entity8 — once of @entity137 and @entity138 — had the respect of his new team - mates and he was a calming influence here , always making the right decision and using the ball sensibly			1
he set a tone that was the catalyst for a clinical performance			0
in order to give his team some freshness following their midweek trip to @entity151 , @entity7 made six changes to @entity16 ’s starting line - up and his reward was a blistering start that left @entity27 frantically trying to catch their breath			1
@entity8 worked his socks off in @entity16 ’s win at @entity24			1
far from his more familiar role as a target man , he played as an attacking midfielder in support of @entity5			2
though nominally playing down the left , he roved across the width of the pitch , as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows ( below )			0
and he put in a shift in his own box for corners too			0
not too shabby for a 33 - year - old			2
@entity5 celebrates after putting his side 2 - 1 up at @entity24 on sunday afternoon @entity5 strikes the ball to put @entity16 ahead in the @entity175 on sunday afternoon the @entity16 team celebrate after @entity5 's goal 29 minutes into their game against strugglers @entity27 at @entity24 mins @entity180 @entity27 total 122.3 76.0 @entity50 86 12.3 7.6 @entity49 90 12.2 7.6 @entity48 90 11.9 7.4 @entity16 total 122.4 76.0 @entity70 90 11.9 7.4 @entity66 90 11.7 7.3 @entity67 90 11.2 6.9 data courtesy of the @entity182 , the @entity183 of the @entity175 when @entity16 ’s passing clicks , they are an impressive side to watch and never was that more apparent than in the fourth minute as the ball zipped from one white shirt to another , sweeping the length of the pitch			1
the move culminated in @entity66 sending @entity63 scampering down the left and the @entity196 full back ’s inch - perfect cross was given the finish it deserved , as @entity8 ’s bullet header thudded against the underside of the bar before hitting the back of @entity41 ’s net			1
@entity27 were startled by @entity16 ’s speed out of the blocks but gradually they regained composure themselves and they received an expected gift in the 20th minute that enabled them to secure parity			2
@entity16 were in no danger when @entity5 took possession just by the halfway line but , carelessly and inexplicably , he gave the ball to @entity52 , who wasted no time sending @entity54 away			1
the @entity196 under 21 striker did the rest , rounding @entity61 and finishing with aplomb			2
much to @entity27 ’s frustration , however , it was n’t long before they conceded cheaply once again			0
they had only been on terms for eight minutes when @entity70 found @entity5 in the area and he made up for his aberration with a shot that bobbled beyond @entity41			1
@entity5 's goal included a 25 - pass build - up , and looked impressive using our brilliant @entity1 @entity54 cups his ears to the @entity27 fans after levelling the scores in @entity27 's @entity175 match on sunday @entity54 strikes to ball to make the score 1 - 1 , to the frustration of onlooking duo @entity66 and @entity61 this was @entity16 ’s first victory over @entity27 at @entity24 for 44 years			1
it was also the first time they have enjoyed successive league wins since april			0
@entity27 worked hard after the break but , for all their huff and puff , they rarely looked like blowing @entity16 over and in the 85th minute they were seen off when @entity66 , @entity71 and @entity69 combined to give @entity239 the chance to bend a drive in from 25 yards			2
moments later , he rounded @entity41 again but his shot from a tight angle bounced off the post			0
it was the only slight blip on an otherwise exemplary display			0
‘ it was a very challenging day against a fine team , ’ said @entity248 , whose @entity27 side are still winless			0
‘ @entity8 has been a fine player and still is			2
@entity16 had high - quality players doing what high - quality players do			1
we all wanted @entity175 football but nobody said it ’d be an easy ride			0

@entity8 opened the scoring early on for @entity16 with a *thunderous* header in off the crossbar
@entity54 levelled the scores *shortly* after when he took the ball round @entity61 and *slotted* home
@entity5 restored @entity16 's lead in the second half , but was always second - best to his strike partner
@entity8 made sure of the points with his second of the match in the second half , a *wonderful* curling effort
