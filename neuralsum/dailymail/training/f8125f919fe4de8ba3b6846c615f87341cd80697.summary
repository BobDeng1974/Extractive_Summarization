by @entity0 published : 15:04 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 03:47 est , 25 november 2013 the frozen body of legendary explorer @entity3 was spotted by a fellow pioneer on the slopes of @entity7 decades before the remains were finally recovered , a forgotten diary has revealed			2
@entity9 , who made several attempts on the world 's highest peak in the 1930s , wrote that he saw what he believed to be the remains on @entity16 and his partner @entity17 through a powerful telescope in 1936			1
mr @entity9 's report is the only sighting of @entity16 's remains before they were eventually found by @entity23 in 1999			1
it was mentioned in a letter to @entity26 , who led the expedition in 1924 when @entity16 disappeared in a bid for the summit			2
legendary : @entity3 , pictured left in the @entity31 in 1909 , and right during the @entity32 , died attempting to scale @entity7 on an expedition in 1924 a copy of the letter was found in the back of the explorer 's diary by his son , @entity39 , while researching a book about this father 's life			1
according to the @entity45 , the letter said : ' i was scanning the face from base camp through a high - powered telescope last year when i saw something queer in a gully below the scree shelf			0
' of course it was a long way away and very small , but i 've a six / six eyesight and do not believe it was a rock			0
' this object was at precisely the point where @entity16 and @entity60 would have fallen had they rolled on over the scree slopes			0
' mr @entity9 explained that he felt compelled to search the area as it was directly above the point at which a previous expedition found an ice axe , which is believed to have marked the scene of a fatal accident			1
although mr @entity9 , a prolific author , wrote extensively about his expeditions , he left out details of the sighting of @entity16 , and made clear in his letter to mr @entity26 that it was not to be written about , in case it triggered a storm of media speculation			1
secret : @entity9 , pictured , wrote a letter explaining the sighting , but asked for it to go no further treacherous : @entity9 says he saw @entity16 's remains at the bottom of a gully on the face of @entity7 mystery : nobody knows whether @entity16 reached the summit			1
his remains were not recovered until 1999 it is one of the most celebrated mysteries of modern mountaineering whether @entity16 and @entity60 managed to reach the summit of @entity7 before dying on the mountain			0
sir @entity95 and @entity96 were the first climbers to definitively reach in summit , with the aid of oxygen , in 1953			0
mr @entity9 reached 28,200ft in an expedition in 1933 , less than 800ft from the summit , but had to turn back			2
he made further attempts on the summit , including the 1936 expedition where he sighted @entity16 's remains , but never matched his record .			0

mr @entity9 , who came within 800ft of peak , saw body through a telescope
he wrote of the sighting to @entity26 , who had climbed with @entity16
but he asked that he keep it secret to avoid causing a sensation
a copy of the letter was found in an old diary by mr @entity9 's son @entity120
