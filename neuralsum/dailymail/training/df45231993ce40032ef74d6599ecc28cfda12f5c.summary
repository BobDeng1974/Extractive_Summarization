out with a wave and a whimper they went			0
out without the slightest echo of @entity4 raging against the injustice of a disallowed goal			0
or the sense of crushing disappointment following the penalties against @entity10 that marked the end of @entity13 ’s tenure and prompted @entity14 to quit the @entity16 captaincy in tears			1
during a spell in charge that almost now feels like a golden era for the @entity16 team , @entity13 had even led @entity22 at the quarter - final stage four years earlier , only to then lose to a @entity25 lob that had @entity26 blubbing , too			2
it had @entity47 raging at a young player for undermining what had been a fine @entity16 performance			1
but at least @entity16 went down fighting			1
at least they played with a bit of style and vigour			0
here ? there was nothing like that			0
there was just this sense of meek surrender			1
a sense that @entity16 had come to the greatest @entity61 in history and pretty much stunk the place out			2
@entity29 tried to give this encounter with @entity65 some meaning , standing as he did in the dug - out for the entire match			2
he certainly acted as if it mattered			0
but if this was the first step towards a brighter future , the first step away from the nadir that was defeat by @entity72 , then why end the game with @entity75 and @entity76 in midfield ? @entity78 , misguided though he was in the timing of his comments , said these matches here in @entity22 would prove valuable experience for @entity83			1
game - changer : @entity85 gives @entity14 his marching orders time old conundrum : @entity16 ended up with @entity76 and @entity75 in midfield but what value , beyond sentiment , could there be in reuniting @entity75 and @entity76 for 17 minutes when their failure to operate effectively as a partnership has been a source of frustration for more than a decade ? ‘ we need to improve , otherwise we would not be going home , ’ said @entity76 afterwards			1
‘ it is about the future and looking for them to get better			2
@entity29 may take comfort in the reception he and his players received from @entity16 ’s fans at the end			1
but he should n’t kid himself into thinking it was an acceptance of failure			1
it was actually rather surreal ; a response , you suspect , driven almost by pity			0
nobody can claim it was anything other than a pitiful effort over the three matches , with this performance providing further evidence that @entity29 fails as an international manager where others succeed			1
hollow applause : @entity16 's performance at the @entity61 has been a disaster down and out : @entity16 players applaud their fans after ending their @entity61 in the group stage @entity130 turned a dodgy @entity132 defence against @entity133 into a superbly disciplined one against @entity134			1
here , @entity16 still looked vulnerable to long balls			2
@entity76 seized on the positives			2
‘ it was amazing , ’ he said of the reception they received at the end from the fans			1
‘ they were singing for the manager			2
it made you proud to be an @entity146			0
it makes you feel a bit bad we have not given them a longer stay			0
’ @entity76 also said such support would help the younger players in the future			1
but they need more than that			0
they need leadership and guidance and a clear vision of how they should play			0
they need to know that this will never happen again			0
that the people in charge , the people in the highest offices at the @entity166 , implement the changes to make damn sure it does n’t happen again			0
whether they will , of course , is another question entirely .			0

@entity16 went down fighting at previous @entity174
there was nothing like that . there was just this sense of meek surrender
if this was the first step towards a brighter future , then why end the game with @entity75 and @entity76 in midfield ?
@entity29 may take comfort in the reception he and his players received from @entity16 ’s fans at the end . but he should *n't* kid himself into thinking it was an acceptance of failure
nobody can claim it was anything other than a pitiful effort , with this performance providing further evidence that @entity29 fails as an international manager where others succeed
