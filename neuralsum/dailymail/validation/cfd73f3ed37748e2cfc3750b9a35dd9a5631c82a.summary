last year ’s @entity1 finalists @entity2 are still in the @entity1 ... just			1
after 120 exhausting minutes @entity4 ’s side won on penalties with @entity6 scoring the home side ’s last spot - kick and @entity9 missing his to put @entity2 through			1
the dramatic climax began with @entity11 blazing the first kick over the bar			2
substitute goalkeeper @entity14 saved @entity16 ’s awful spot - kick hit low and straight down the middle to put the @entity18 back in with a chance of progress			1
@entity6 celebrates scoring his penalty which put @entity2 into a crucial 3 - 2 lead during the shootout @entity6 congratulates substitute goalkeeper @entity14 following the @entity25 's impressive performance @entity27 's goalkeeper @entity26 is unable to stop @entity6 ' penalty , leaving the @entity30 side with a mountain to climb @entity14 jumps for the decisive penalty from @entity9 , but did n't need to make a save as the shot sailed over his crossbar @entity2 players sprint towards @entity14 's goal after @entity9 misses his penalty and hands the home side victory a dejected @entity9 walks back to the centre circle knowing his spot - kick miss had handed victory to the home side @entity14 and @entity2 captain @entity42 console the distraught @entity30 as @entity27 crash out of the @entity1 the @entity27 players look on during the @entity1 last 16 penalty shootout against @entity2 @entity2 : @entity46 ( @entity47 22 ' ) , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 ' ) , @entity54 , @entity42 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 ' ) subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 booked : @entity50 , @entity64 , @entity54 , @entity6 goals : @entity54 27 ' @entity27 : @entity26 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ( @entity73 114 ' ) , @entity74 ( @entity75 76 ' ) , @entity16 , @entity76 ( @entity9 68 ' ) subs not used : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 booked : @entity68 , @entity82 , @entity16 , @entity73 , @entity69 referee : @entity84 ( @entity85 ) @entity56 stepped up and showed everyone how penalties should be taken scoring high into the roof of the net			1
@entity75 did likewise to level the scores and @entity54 scored his second goal of the night having put @entity2 ahead in normal time			1
when @entity82 put his kick nervously over the bar @entity2 looked to have the finish line in sight only for @entity26 to save @entity42 ’s kick			1
@entity71 then scored but after @entity6 had snuck his penalty just inside @entity26 ’s right hand upright @entity9 missed and the @entity100 erupted with joy			1
@entity2 came into the game one goal down from the first leg and struggled to make in - roads early on with a @entity42 free - kick not really testing @entity26			2
@entity108 ’s team knew one lapse on the break would need them leaving to score three and when @entity112 was put through by @entity72 on 22 minutes it was his miscontrol that prevented him getting a shot on target			0
as he came out to close down son , @entity2 goalkeeper @entity46 pulled a hamstring and had to be replaced by @entity14			1
losing their keeper and having to use a substitute so early was a major set - back for @entity4 but four minutes later he was running along the touchline as @entity2 took the lead			1
@entity52 headed the ball down for @entity54 and his shot through the crowded penalty area caught and went past @entity26 to put the home side ahead on the night			2
with their next attack @entity2 could have got the all - important second goal but a brilliant tackle from @entity69 denied @entity57			0
it was @entity133 ’s pefect through ball that put the @entity136 striker through but as he delayed his shot the @entity139 defender clean swept the ball away from him to safety			0
it was brilliant defending but would any of @entity2 ’s previous strikers – @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 – have buried it before the defender could react ? probably yes			0
@entity150 midfielder @entity149 ( right ) was unable to watch the action during the penalty shootout @entity4 was forced to make an early substitution following the injury for no 1 goalkeeper @entity46 @entity50 ( left ) was shown a yellow card for this late challenge on @entity16 @entity50 and his @entity158 team - mates plead innocence as referee @entity84 shows the defender a yellow card @entity54 ( left ) strikes from the edge of the box to put @entity158 into a 1 - 0 lead and level the aggregate scoreline to 1 - 1 against @entity27 @entity2 : @entity167 leverkusen : @entity169 @entity2 : @entity170 leverkusen : @entity75 - @entity170 @entity2 : @entity54 - scores leverkusen : @entity173 @entity2 : @entity174 leverkusen : @entity176 @entity2 : @entity177 leverkusen : kiessling - misses @entity180 : @entity2 3 - 2 @entity27 battering ram @entity57 perhaps has other qualities but he was battered himself just before half time and left the pitch limping at the break			1
surprisingly when the two teams emerged for the second half he was still on the pitch and @entity4 had taken off @entity52 and put on @entity11			2
the midfield so nearly turned the ball past @entity26 from @entity42 ’s cross in @entity2 ’s best chance of the second half			0
@entity42 had been inspirational throughout as @entity2 took the game to @entity27			2
and as the clock showed 20 minutes of normal time left the crowd responded by cranking up the @entity100 noise levels			0
it spurred the team on and @entity56 hurtled down the left and crossed for @entity149 who flicked the ball behind him where there was no runner to finish the move			0
@entity56 then crossed again for @entity149 and this time he got his shot away only for @entity26 to save			0
@entity11 went down in the area under a challenge from @entity82 but the referee waved away appeals			0
@entity11 stayed down , @entity108 urged him to get up and turned to @entity2 supporters once more to lift his team			2
everyone in the @entity100 got a lift with eight minutes left when @entity6 was roared on to the pitch to replace @entity57			0
could @entity6 win the game for them ? @entity217 proud to again be in @entity219 's elite @entity54 's 27th - minute finish took a large deflection which @entity27 goalkeeper @entity26 was unable to stop the 28 - year - old midfielder wheels away in celebration of his first half effort at the @entity225 @entity149 makes the most of the celebrations as @entity54 is congratulated by @entity2 defender @entity49 ( right ) the @entity158 players smother @entity54 in front of the home fans following the first goal of the game @entity2 boss @entity4 sprints down the touchline after watching @entity54 give the home side a first half lead @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity2 wednesday : @entity241 ( 2 ) vs @entity242 ( 1 ) ; @entity243 ( 1 ) vs @entity244 ( 2 ) with the match still on a knife - edge @entity16 upended @entity51 and became the third @entity27 player to be booked			1
@entity2 had also picked up three yellow cards and there was no let - up as the clock ticked down			0
@entity252 became the seventh player to be booked when he chopped down @entity6 as he charged down the right with a minute left			0
the free - kick came to nothing but @entity6 kept going and forced a corner but @entity42 ’s near - post kick was cleared and the referee blew for full time			2
@entity9 was booked at the start of extra time – the @entity30 team ’s fifth on the night – and they then had to take off the injured @entity72 replacing him with @entity73			0
@entity6 was still stretching the opposition and with @entity27 on the back foot a stinging shot from @entity11 was pushed away for a corner by @entity26 but over the two legs the @entity30 had proved as good at defending them as @entity2 at taking them			1
with five minutes to go @entity6 so nearly won it with a diving header from @entity42 ’s cross			0
there was direction on the effort but not enough power to beat @entity26			0
it did n’t matter , he scored his penalty and his dream of reaching another @entity1 final - this time with his home town club - lives on			1
@entity6 ( right ) had to wait until the 82nd - minute before entering the action after replacing @entity57 @entity6 looks on in disbelief after an opportunity goes begging during the closing stages of normal time @entity56 ( right ) looks to get the better of @entity68 during the @entity1 last 16 second leg @entity57 lies on the ground in pain following a late tackle from @entity139 defender @entity69 @entity238 boss @entity293 ( centre ) was in attendance at the @entity100 to oversee the @entity297 action			1

@entity2 earn @entity1 *quarter* - final spot after penalty shootout victory against @entity27
after @entity11 blazed over the bar , substitute goalkeeper @entity14 saved @entity16 's *woeful* spot kick
@entity27 's @entity9 missed the final penalty to hand @entity158 victory
@entity6 scored @entity2 's final penalty to put pressure on @entity9
