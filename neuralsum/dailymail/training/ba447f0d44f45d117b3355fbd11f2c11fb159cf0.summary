by @entity1 reporter published : 01:31 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 14 march 2013 first lady @entity2 has appeared on the cover of @entity4 for the second time , talking about family values and pushing back at critics who say she and the president need to socialize more			1
mrs @entity2 , 49 , was captured in the april 2013 issue of the magazine - which hits newsstands on march 26 - by famed photographer @entity11			1
she first appeared on the cover of @entity4 in march 2009 - right after her husband was inaugurated for his first term			1
cover girl : first lady @entity2 has appeared on her second cover of @entity4 , for the april 2013 issue that will hit newsstands on march 26 in an open , and assertive stance , she leans against a table and looks directly into the camera ’s lens with her bare arms resting at her side			1
wearing a @entity25 dress , taken from her own closet , in cerulean blue with a flourish of purple at the neckline , mrs @entity2 looks comfortable , at ease , and happy			1
by contrast , for mrs @entity2 ’s debut appearance on the @entity4 cover in march 2009 , she sat curled on a sofa with her arms lightly wrapped one over the other in a protective gesture ; and the discomfort in her facial expression is palpable			1
in the accompanying interview , by @entity42 , the @entity2 summarizes her relationship to fashion			1
her style is mentioned only once in the profile , and in just one paragraph - insinuating perhaps that she has more important things on her mind			2
picture perfect : mrs @entity2 , wearing the same reed @entity52 dress , poses with the president ; the smiling couple are draped over one - and - other affectionately ' i always say that women should wear whatever makes them feel good about themselves			1
that ’s what i always try to do , ' she explained			0
' i also believe that if you ’re comfortable in your clothes it ’s easy to connect with people and make them feel comfortable as well			0
in every interaction that i have with people , i always want to show them my most authentic self			0
' for the new issue , she wears the same dress for the inside feature with the president , who is dressed in a pinstriped shirt and a striped blue tie			0
mrs @entity2 's choice of @entity25 for the cover is a significant one - she also wore the label in her latest official portrait , and for the president 's swearing - in			1
flashback : mrs @entity2 graced the march issue of @entity4 in 2009 in the picture , the smiling couple are draped over one - and - other - the president 's arm on his wife 's knee and her long arms placed affectionately around his neck			1
a third photograph captures her in profile , wearing a black slim - fitting @entity95 long - sleeve top and fishtail ball skirt - a picture of sporty elegance			0
@entity95 has become one of mrs @entity2 's most popular go - to choices ; she has frequently worn his designs since her entry into the @entity103 five years ago , and even posed for her first official portrait wearing a sleeveless @entity95 shift			1
for much of the interview , the first lady discusses their family values , explaining that she and the president were straightforward when they said - before moving from @entity112 to @entity113 in 2009 - that their family , including two young daughters @entity117 and @entity118 , would be their priority			0
she said ' the stresses and the pressures ' of the @entity103 are so real that they prefer to spend free time with their daughters , now 14 and 11			2
' our job is , first and foremost , to make sure our family is whole			0
you know , we have small kids ; they 're growing every day , ' mrs @entity2 said in the interview			1
' but i think we were both pretty straightforward when we said , " our no. 1 priority is making sure that our family is whole			0
" ' she noted that most of the couple 's friends are parents , too , and that when she and the president go on vacation , usually with longtime friends or relatives , they are surrounded by children			0
' the stresses and the pressures of this job are so real that when you get a minute , you want to give that extra energy to your 14 - and 11 - year - old , ' the @entity2 said			2
keeping it blue : at the inauguration ceremony at the @entity103 in january , she also chose a silk dress by @entity25 - the eponymous label set up by @entity152 's former creative head in 2010 twice as nice : mrs @entity2 wore @entity95 at a @entity154 dinner in september last year ( left ) ; a dress she first wore on in june at a dinner with @entity158 president @entity157 ( right ) the president joked in the @entity4 interview that he and the @entity2 might start hitting the town , now that their daughters are older and have less time for them			1
' as i joked at a press conference , now that they want less time with us , who knows ? maybe you 'll see us out in the clubs , ' @entity2 said			1
mrs @entity2 added that ' 90 per cent ' of what she and the president talk about has to do with the girls : what they 're up to , who has practice , which one of their friends is having a birthday party and did they get that person a gift - conversation she described as ' endless ' and ' pretty exhausting			1
' ' @entity184 had to change the way they do things ... because they want to make sure these girls are happy and have a normal life ' she suggested that neither one of them wants to miss any of it			0
@entity2 grew up without his father and has talked publicly about his desire to be there for his kids			2
' he 's doing it while still dealing with @entity198 and health care			0
he 's as up on every friend , every party , every relationship , ' the @entity2 said			2
' and if you 're out to dinner every night , you miss those moments where you can check - in and just figure them out when they 're ready to share with you			0
' mrs @entity2 also talked about the struggle to give their growing daughters a ' normal life			1
' she said : ' @entity184 has to change the way they do things ; they have to become more flexible			0
because they want to make sure that these girls are happy and that they have a normal life			0
' there ’s a lot of energy that goes into working with staff , working with agents , working with friends ’ parents to figure out how do we , you know , let these kids go to the party and have a sleepover and walk through the city on their own , go to the game			0
' it requires us to be there and be present so that we can respond and have the system respond to their needs , ' she explained			0
fashion forward : mrs @entity2 uses her incredible sense of style as a powerful tool , often shining the spotlight on up - and - coming @entity241 designers power woman : mrs @entity2 's appearance in @entity4 comes just months after her husband secured re-election ; she was lauded for @entity247 coat and matching dress family values : the first lady opens up about family values in the @entity4 feature , pushing back at critics who say she and the president need to socialize more discussing their 20 - year marriage , the president reveals : ' there ’s no doubt i ’m a better man having spent time with @entity2			1
i would never say that @entity2 ’s a better woman , but i will say she ’s a little more patient			2
' mrs @entity2 responded with a smile : ' i would say i ’m a better woman			1
' the pair also touch on how being in the @entity103 has had an effect on their wardrobes			0
the president says he went from having only two suits , to dozens			0
' thank god , ' said mrs @entity2			1
' let me tell you : this is the man who still boasts about , " this khaki pair of pants i ’ve had since i was 20			0
" and i ’m like , " you do n’t want to brag about that			0
" ' laughing , the president added : ' @entity2 ’s like @entity280 in that song , " let me upgrade ya ! " she upgraded me			2

@entity4 's editor , @entity286 , was a top fundraiser for the @entity2 re-election campaign , raking in more than $ 500,000			2
last year , it was rumored that @entity286 was tapped to be the @entity2 administration 's ambassador to @entity292 as a result of those efforts , however those rumors were put to rest yesterday when it was announced she had been promoted to ' artistic director ' of @entity296 .			2
