from magnets to ' invisibility ' wetsuits , scientists have tried many tactics to help swimmers evade the potentially deadly jaws of sharks			0
now , an inventor has developed a wearable device that emits the sounds of killer whales , which are known to attack sharks			1
the ' @entity14 ' device is designed to be attached to a surfer ’s ankle and has been shown to repel sharks in waters filled with bait			1
@entity48 , 52 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , is raising funds for his @entity14 on crowd funding site @entity50 , has spent 10 years developing the product			1
he worked with marine biologists and shark experts to test it on different species and in various locations , including in ‘ extreme circumstances ' when the water was filled with blood and other bait to tempt sharks			1
the predators came within five feet ( 1.5 metres ) of the device but turned back at this point when they heard the noisy device , mr @entity48 claims			0
thh inventor worked with marine biologists to find a frequency to repel sharks ( illustrated )			1
he explained that the sound includes that of a pod of orcas and scares sharks either because they are wary of the killer whales , or they simply do n’t want to deal with the disturbance the device creates sound : the @entity14 emits a low power acoustic signal			1
experts agree that killer whales - sharks ' main predators - use a variety of complex sounds			1
the device emulates these noises so that the frequency , combined with the sharks ' natural fear of their main predator , keeps them at a safe distance			1
weight and size : 4 inches ( 10cm ) long and 2 inches ( 5cm ) wide			2
wearable : it 's designed to be worn on the ankle because sharks can appear in less than 2ft ( 1metre ) of water			1
effects on the body : the inventor claims there are no adverse effects on the human body because the device uses sound waves audible to sharks in one direction			1
it does not harm sharks either			0
tests : the device has been tested in shark hotspots including the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity25			1
cost : available to pre-order on @entity50 for $ 225 ( £ 139 )			1
while the deterrent may be large , the device itself is small , measuring four inches ( 10cm ) long and two inches ( 5cm ) wide , weighing just 0.3lbs ( 140g ) , which is roughly the weight of a smartphone			1
it is powered by a rechargeable battery and lasts for around six to seven hours			0
mr @entity48 said he came up with the idea for the @entity14 when his mother told him about the constant shark attacks in @entity130 , @entity117 , where she had moved to from @entity25			1
‘ @entity130 @entity117 is the shark attack capital of the world			0
this title is for bites , not fatalities , ’ he said			0
‘ after hearing about these repeated attacks in @entity117 , i investigated sound as a possible deterrent to sharks			2
‘ it took a couple of years and multiple locations with different species of sharks until i was convinced that i found the right sound that would repel sharks			1
’ mr @entity48 talked to surfers and was surprised to find that many of them have seen sharks in the water			2
‘ surfers are an amazing group , they know the dangers of the sport - like rip currents , rogue waves and sharks - yet they continue to go out and enjoy the sport they love , ’ he said			2
the device has been tested in shark hotspots including the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity25 on great whites ( pictured left ) tiger and sand tiger sharks ( pictured right ) which are among the species responsible for the most attacks on humans while the deterrent may be large , the device itself is small , measuring four inches ( 10cm ) long and two inches ( 5cm ) wide , weighing just 0.3lbs ( 140g ) so it can be worn on a surfer 's ankle ( pictured ) great white sharks , tiger sharks and bull sharks pose the most threat to humans , according to statistics and journal reports of shark attack fatalities			1
they may be the biggest offenders because of their size			0
great whites can be 20ft long			0
even if one of these species is not intending to attack a human , the size of its jaws are huge and they have teeth designed to rip instead of hold			2
the @entity193 includes 279 known attacks on humans since records began , 78 of which were fatal , @entity192 reported			0
sand tiger , blacktip , hammerhead and spinner sharks have all been responsible for between 100 and 16 deaths attacks each			0
‘ we set out at the beginning to investigate sound as a possible shark repellent			2
‘ we always believed sound can attract sharks but it must also repel them because sharks pick up the sounds of splashing and the sounds of injured prey			2
‘ @entity214 have an inner ear made up of three semicircular canals			0
inside each canal are four sensory areas which are responsible for both balance and sound perception			0
‘ sharks hear sounds with frequencies ranging from @entity224 to @entity225 , and are especially responsive to sounds @entity226 or lower			0
‘ we found a particular frequency range and modulation that was effective against many species of sharks			2
’ he explained that the sound includes that of a pod of killer whales and scares sharks either because they are scared of the predators , or they simply do n’t want to deal with the disturbance the device creates			1
the device is available to pre-order on @entity50 for $ 225 ( £ 139 ) with an estimated delivery date of january			1
sharks hear sounds with frequencies ranging from @entity224 to @entity225 , and are especially responsive to sounds @entity226 or lower			0
in tests , the inventor found that sharks will not come within five feet of the noisy device , which if worn by swimmers , could protect them in the water ( illustrated ) @entity214 may have a fearsome reputation , but they can also be solitary , preferring to remain in the background , according to new research			1
@entity256 scientists claim they have shown that the notorious predators have personality traits that determines how they behave in groups			0
a @entity261 team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks in captivity under three different habitat types			0
the species of shark are found throughout the northeast @entity270 and @entity271 and usually form mixed - sexed social groups driven by individual familiarity			1
ten groups of sharks were monitored in large tanks containing three habitats which differed in their level of structural complexity			0
a @entity261 team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks ( pictured ) in captivity under three different habitat types ' we found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed , socially well - connected individuals remained well - connected under each new habitat , ' said dr @entity288 , a behavioural ecologist now at the @entity290 ( @entity290 ) , @entity291			2
' in other words , their social network positions were repeated through time and across different habitats			0
' these results were driven by different social preferences that appeared to reflect different strategies for staying safe			0
' the study found that well - connected sharks formed groups , while less social individuals tended to camouflage alone , matching their skin colour with the colour of the gravel at the bottom of the tank			2
' in the wild these small juveniles can make easy prey items for larger fish , so different anti-predator strategies are likely to have evolved , ' said professor @entity313 , of the @entity314 at @entity261 .			0

device is intended to be attached to a surfer or swimmer 's ankle
it is roughly the size and weight of a smartphone , emitting a noise similar to the sound of killer whales to scare off a number of shark species
device is the *brainchild* of an inventor in @entity24 , @entity25
it was tested in shark hotspots and kept sharks away from the device by at least *5ft* - even if there was blood and bait in the water
@entity14 is available to pre-order on @entity50 for $ 225 ( £ 139 )
