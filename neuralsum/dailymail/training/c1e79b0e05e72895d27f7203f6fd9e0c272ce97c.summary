after a trial at the @entity14 they were found guilty of murder and will be sentenced tomorrow			1

@entity9 ( pictured left ) and @entity8 ( right ) beat mr @entity7 to within an inch of his life , then left him for dead later that morning , a member of the public found mr @entity7 in an alleyway , severely injured , naked , unconscious and barely breathing			1
he died in hospital the same day			2
prosecutor @entity25 said mr @entity7 had been drinking at the @entity27 pub where he was seen to be to be dancing and enjoying himself			1
but the evening turned sour when he met the defendants at a nearby off - licence where one witness thought the victim had tried to ' chat up ' @entity8 , a possible trigger for the violence , mr @entity29 said			2
later , the victim tried to calm the defendants down when they became aggressive at a minicab office after a driver refused to take @entity8 home because she was drunk			0
@entity8 began punching and pushing mr @entity7 around outside and @entity9 weighed in with a punch because he did not like the idea of the victim fighting a girl , even though he was not retaliating , the court heard			1
@entity9 then suggested to @entity8 that they should go into a nearby alleyway to ' sort this out ' , the court heard			2
@entity7 ( pictured ) was stripped naked and left for dead in a skip after the savage assault the attack was witnessed by a 15 - year - old boy who saw @entity8 and @entity9 kicking mr @entity7 as he lay on the floor trying to protect himself and begging ' stop , please stop '			1
the boy heard @entity8 laughing as he turned away because he could not bear to watch , mr @entity29 told jurors			2
and when @entity8 and @entity9 emerged from the alleyway , the witness heard @entity8 say ' we f * * * * * him up bad ' before they told him not to tell anyone about what happened , jurors were told			1
@entity8 ( pictured ) and @entity9 denied all knowledge of the incident when first interviewed by police the victim was found at 7am that day , the prosecutor said : ' mr @entity7 was lying in the skip on top of builders ' rubbish			1
he was completely naked save for a bandana around his neck			0
these defendants must have removed his clothing as an act of humiliation			0
' mr @entity7 was still breathing in a laboured fashion but was unresponsive and cold to the touch			1
police noticed the large number of abrasions and cuts to his body			0
his face was very swollen and his eyes were closed			0
' police wrapped him in a blanket to keep him warm before the ambulance arrived , but mr @entity7 died later that morning at @entity88			1
a post-mortem examination showed he suffered injuries consistent with kicking and stamping			0
he suffered a skull fracture as well as a broken nose , cheekbone and rib			0
after @entity8 and @entity9 were arrested , they made no comment in police interviews , but mr @entity29 said their defence was to pass blame onto each other for mr @entity7 's death			1
mr @entity29 said : ' it is clear from the evidence that ... both @entity9 and @entity8 were both drunk and behaving very aggressively that night			2
' but being drunk was no defence , he said : ' they had the wit to take mr @entity7 down that alleyway out of the sight of passers - by and cctv cameras			1
the assault was not random - their kicks targeted mr @entity7 's face and head			1
' they had the physical co-ordination to attack him so viciously , to strip him naked , and to place his naked body into a skip			0
' on emerging they had the presence of mind by telling ( the witness ) that he should not tell anyone what he had seen			0
' the victim , who was originally from @entity128 , in @entity129 , but lived with his mother in @entity131 in south @entity11 , had suffered from depression and anxiety and been a heroin user in the past			0
the two were found guilty in a trial at the @entity14 ( pictured ) and will be sentenced tomorrow but mr @entity29 said that despite being ' a drinker ' , he was known as ' a friendly man who was not aggressive or violent '			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 , and @entity8 , of @entity140 , @entity141 , denied murder but a jury took less than a day to convict them both			2
after the verdict , detective chief inspector @entity144 said : ' @entity146 was described by his friends and family as a friendly man and did nothing to provoke the savage attack that would ultimately cause his death			0
' @entity153 and @entity9 did their best to thwart our investigation , denying all knowledge when first interviewed			2
' they have been found to have acted in a very calculated fashion , taking @entity146 down an alleyway out of the sight of passers - by and cctv cameras before aiming vicious blows to his head			0
' although drunk , both coldly and deliberately acted to hide @entity146 's body after the deadly attack			0
' mr @entity7 's family said in a statement : ' we love and miss you lots and lots , you will never be forgotten			1
' @entity7 was such a kind , gentle - natured spirit , always happy - go - lucky with a dry sense of humour			0
he had a kind heart and was a loving big blue - eyed sliver fox			0
