@entity0 is to add a Â£ 19million gothic tower - its first new building in 270 years - as part of major plans to create a new museum and exhibition space			1
the tower will allow public access to the @entity0 's eastern @entity10 gallery , which will be turned into a museum called @entity12			1
exhibits will include a selection of treasures , including royal funeral effigies , silverware and stonework			1
the 14th century @entity20 manuscript and a crimson velvet cope worn by the @entity22 at @entity24 's coronation will also be on display			0
new tower : this before - and - after view shows what @entity0 will look like with the new @entity30 tower , seen in the centre of the image as an artist 's impression the project is the most significant addition to the fabric of the @entity0 church since the construction of @entity41 's west towers in 1745			2
it is expected to open in early 2018 after @entity44 council approved the plans this week			0
the @entity10 gallery runs 70 feet above the floor of the @entity0 and around almost all its internal walls			1
when @entity50 began to rebuild the @entity0 church in the 13th century , he planned to house chapels at the east end of the @entity10 , but the idea was never followed through			1
plans to open up the gallery will give visitors views along the whole length of the @entity0 and create a new and much larger museum and an exhibition space			1
the tower , which will reflect the gothic architecture of the @entity0 church , will be ' substantial but largely hidden from view ' and ' should be entirely in keeping with the historic fabric of the @entity64 ' , according to a statement released online last year			2
it has been designed by the @entity0 's @entity67 , consultant architect , @entity69			2
the very rev @entity70 , the @entity22 , said : ' we are delighted that our proposals for the new tower and for opening the eastern @entity10 to the public have the support of @entity76 , reflecting that of our local community and of other bodies concerned for the preservation of the local and national heritage			1
model : this to - scale replica of @entity0 shows the skeleton of the new tower , centre , which will be largely hidden from view on display : the 14th century @entity20 manuscript , pictured , will be on show in the exhibition space along with a selection of treasures ' this planning approval will enable us to approach with confidence the final stages of the necessary fund - raising and drive us towards the timely completion and opening of @entity12 , the most exciting development of the @entity0 building for over 250 years			1
' famous writers including @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 are buried in the 900 - year - old @entity0 , as well as 17 monarchs			1
@entity107 , deputy leader of @entity76 , said : ' in a city full of spectacular buildings , @entity0 stands out not only for its architectural merit but for the fundamental role it plays in our cultural and civic life			0
' i am certain that this new tower , which will give people access to some of the abbey 's previously hidden treasures , will be an attractive and successful addition to the city 's heritage			1
' much of the present building was built during the reign of @entity126 in 1245 he pulled down the eastern part of the 11th century @entity0 , which had been founded by @entity128 and dedicated in 1065			2
it is said that @entity50 's devotion to @entity131 later prompted him to build a more magnificent church in the newest gothic style , and also to provide a new shrine for the @entity135			0
the architect was influenced by the new cathedrals that had been built in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 at the time , and used characteristic @entity30 features of pointed arches , ribbed vaulting and rose windows in his design			0
the @entity64 has the highest @entity30 vault in @entity149 - nearly 102 feet - and the narrow aisles were made to make it seem even higher			0
by 1269 the apse , radiating chapels , transepts and choir were complete and the new shrine received the bones of @entity131 on 13 october			0
the next major addition to the building was the construction of a new @entity160 by @entity161 between 1503 and 1519 to replace the 13th century chapel			0
the architecture in this part of the @entity0 contrasts with the rest and no records for this building have been found			2
the last phase of building was the completion in 1745 of the @entity171 in @entity173 stone , to a design by @entity41 , the @entity175			0
the new power is expected to open in early 2018 after @entity44 council approved the plans this week .			0

it will give public access to the east end of the @entity10 , where they will be able to see along the length of the abbey
