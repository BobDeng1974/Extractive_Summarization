by @entity0 and @entity1 families could be forced to recycle yet more of their rubbish under tough new waste directives proposed yesterday by @entity5			1
households are already forced to separate rubbish into various coloured bins , boxes and buckets as @entity11 attempts to hit a @entity13 target of recycling half our waste by 2020			1
but the @entity16 now wants us to recycle at least 70 per cent of municipal waste – most of which comes from homes – by 2030			0
local government secretary @entity21 has called weekly bin collections a ' funadamental right ' - because it stops rubbish building up like this in @entity26 other targets include recycling 80 per cent of packaging by the same year , tighter food waste reduction rules – and a ban by 2025 on sending anything to landfill that can be recycled			1
the stricter targets could force councils to adopt more coercive methods to force households to recycle more , such as pay - as - you - throw bin taxes or fines for people who fail to sort their rubbish properly			2
@entity11 is currently struggling to hit the 50 per cent target by 2020 , let alone the proposed stricter ones			2
in the 12 months to september last year @entity44 ’s household recycling rate actually fell from 44.1 per cent to 43.9 per cent , and councils are already under pressure to bring in more ambitious compulsory recycling methods next year to get the figures up			0
communities secretary @entity21 yesterday pledged to fight the new proposals			2
he said : ‘ hard - working families pay a lot of money in council tax and they deserve a proper rubbish and recycling collection in return			1
’ the @entity16 claims a so - called ‘ circular economy ’ with more recycling will boost the @entity13 economy and create 580,000 new jobs			0
it said : ‘ keeping materials in productive use for longer , re-using them , and with improved efficiency , would also improve @entity65 competitiveness on the global stage			0
’ rubbish recycling has been politically sensitive in @entity11 for the past decade after it became clear that @entity69 ’s drive to increase recycling was unpopular			1
@entity21 is considering making it a legal requirement for councils to collect black bin bags every week @entity76 rubbish collections , now used across more than half the country , proved vote losers in local elections			1
the @entity80 abandoned plans for taxes and fines for families who break strict wheelie bin rules and mr @entity21 pressed councils to bring back weekly collections			1
the communities secretary added yesterday : ‘ this government has scrapped @entity69 ’s bin bully approach – and we will fight attempts to re-impose bureaucracy via the back door of @entity13			0
’ environment department @entity94 also said @entity5 had underestimated the costs , while @entity97 environment minister @entity96 said the new target was out of reach			1
the plans meant ‘ putting more energy into chasing a principle without getting much back ’ , he told mps at the @entity106 environmental audit committee			0
the @entity107 , which represents councils , said the @entity5 scheme would be hugely expensive for local authorities – which have already more than doubled spending on waste and recycling since 2000			2
eurosceptic @entity115 mp @entity114 said : ‘ the @entity16 is recycling the same old policies put forward by the same technocrats			2
’ the most recent figures from @entity65 statistics branch @entity119 reveal that @entity120 is the continent ’s top recycler on 65 per cent			0
@entity11 is on 43.9 per cent , while @entity123 recycles just 39 per cent			0
@entity124 recycles one per cent of its household waste .			0

@entity5 regulation wants *massive* increase in recycling over next 15 years
but @entity115 minister @entity21 says rules will hit rubbish collections
could also see families forced to sort their rubbish into a host of new bins
