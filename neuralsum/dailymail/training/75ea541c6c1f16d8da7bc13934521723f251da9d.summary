by @entity0 published : 07:33 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 11 december 2013 doing a bungee jump from 330ft is risky enough			2
but to make that leap from a live electricity pylon - and then zip - line to the ground with your ropes just below power cables - takes it to a whole new level			2
but you wo n't find the word ' fear ' in daredevil @entity15 's @entity14 dictionary			1
this is the incredible moment the 23 - year - old , from @entity18 , made that very jump			1
in a dramatic sequence of images , the adrenaline junkie can be seen leaping from a makeshift wooden beam precariously placed over the edge of the structure			2
i needed to add some excitement and to do something extreme ' however , instead of plummeting nearly 330ft ( 100m ) to the ground below , she is suddenly snatched to safety by a self - made zip - line running just below live electric wires			2
and as if diving off a huge tower was n't dramatic enough , @entity15 even leaves behind a stream of coloured smoke from a signal flare attached to her ankle			1
taken at @entity32 , near @entity51 , the images prove she has nerves of steel by narrowly avoiding live electric wires on her perilous journey downwards			1

daredevil @entity15 , seen here standing at the top of the electricity pylon , went into freefall for about four seconds as if diving off a huge tower was n't dramatic enough , @entity15 even leaves behind a stream of coloured smoke instead of plummeting nearly 330ft ( 100m ) to the ground below , she is suddenly snatched to safety by a self - made zip line running just below live electric cables ' 2013 has the been the most extreme year of my life			1
bungee jumping is not my only hobby - i also enjoy snowboarding , cliff diving and slack lining [ balancing on a nylon wire between two tethered points ] but this was by far my favourite moment			0
' the pylon was definitely in use when i jumped , but i do n't worry too much about the safety aspect			1
that 's all part of the thrill			0
' i believe the tower is around 100 metres high and i was freefalling for over four seconds			0
' you need to do it yourself to really understand the feeling			0
' inside you have a feeling of absolute freedom mixed with adrenaline and fear , while outside a strong stream of air envelopes your whole body while the wind roars against your ears			0
' bungee jumping is just one of @entity15 's leisure pursuits			1
she also enjoys cliff diving and snowboarding			0

@entity15 , 23 , jumped from pylon on @entity32 , near @entity18 with smoke flare attached to her ankle
