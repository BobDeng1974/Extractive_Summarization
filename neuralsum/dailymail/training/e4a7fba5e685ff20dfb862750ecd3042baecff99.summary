we could refreeze the @entity2 , and it would n't even cost that much , scientists have claimed			1
two recently published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the @entity9			2
the scientist who is lead author on both claims that ' any significant nation ' could find the resources to carry out the operation			1
shrinking habitat : the disappearance of @entity2 sea ice could lead to the extinction of animals like the polar bear - but scientists now claim it could be stopped , and fairly cheaply the only significant question , he says , is whether we should			2
the amount of ice in the @entity27 shrank to an all time low in september , with the total area covered now half what it was in the @entity32			2
@entity33 , professor of applied physics at @entity35 , is lead author on papers published in @entity37 and @entity38 which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice			1
' the really hard questions here are n’t mostly technical			2
they ’re questions about what kind of planet we want and who we are , ' he told @entity49 newspaper @entity48			2
melting : these images from @entity51 show reveal the full extent of @entity2 ice shrinkage , showing a new record low compared to the average minimum extent over the past 30 years ( in yellow ) in a critical climate indicator showing an ever warming world , the amount of ice in the @entity27 shrank to an all time low this summer			0
the shocking new figures revealed in september showed how the ice has halved in size since the @entity32			0
' we are now in uncharted territory , ' said snow and ice data centre director @entity66			0
' while we ’ve long known that as the planet warms up , changes would be seen first and be most pronounced in the @entity2 , few of us were prepared for how rapidly the changes would actually occur			0
' the ice cap at the @entity9 measured 1.32million square miles , according to the new data released in september			0
scientists say this is 18 per cent smaller than the previous record of 1.61million square miles set in 2007 , according to the @entity77 and @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80			0
records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking			1
professor @entity33 used climate models to suggest that injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the @entity89 , engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the @entity2			1
his paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea - ice around the @entity9 back to pre-industrial era levels			1
' decisions involving ( solar radiation management ) do not need to be reduced to a single " global thermostat " , ' the paper says			0
his second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified @entity104 jets , costing somewhere in the region of $ 8billion a year			1
however , while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the @entity89 's atmosphere , he does n't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest			1
open - air and large - scale geoengineering of the kind professor @entity33 has suggested has been ruled out by the @entity116			0
such drastic geoengineering could have disastrous unintended effects but could be a viable response to a ' climate emergency ' such as the sudden collapse of ice sheets or a killing drought , professor @entity33 suggested .			0

@entity35 physicist suggests we could inject reflective particles into the atmosphere to reflect back to light and heat from the @entity131
he estimates the whole operation could be done with just a few jets and would cost just $ 8billion a year
