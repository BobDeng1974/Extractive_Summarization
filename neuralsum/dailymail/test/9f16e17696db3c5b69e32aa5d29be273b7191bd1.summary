@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2			2
every rock band has a face			1
but what if they were seen as one ? in an unusual project by men 's face product company @entity9 , each member of history 's most esteemed rock bands are blended into one			2
at first glance , the photo for @entity22 looks like a blurry picture of a young @entity25			0
@entity0 is clearly visible in @entity27 's merged shot			1
and the features of @entity29 dominate the image of @entity29			0
@entity1 ( second left ) is touted as the ' face ' of @entity22 because he took the lead on many songs			0
but fans , and many others , will know @entity36 ( far left ) , @entity37 ( second right ) and @entity25 ( right ) were equally pivotal the @entity38 : these five faces are some of the most distinctive in the genre of rock @entity43 's rockers : with raspy vocals and a healthy helping of leather , @entity44 made waves in the rock world @entity50 hot : the @entity51 also earned a spot in the list of 30 top rock bands the @entity56 movement : @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) flew @entity60 's flag @entity61 : beneath all that hair are five easily recognizable faces to rock fans others not so much			1
@entity44 is a bizarre mix of the @entity68 bunch , as is the @entity38 picture			1
and aside from a hint of @entity73 's eyeliner , @entity70 also blend into something somewhat unrecognizable			2
publishing the project , @entity9 wrote in ablog post : ' we wanted to include @entity79 with makeup , however the result was just a white and black mess			0
' as for @entity84 , that image was simple a mashup of sunglasses and facial hair			0

members of 30 rock band members merged into one face each
