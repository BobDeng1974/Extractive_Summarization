it was shortly after the clinic opened in @entity20 in 2012 that he received the first unwanted letter			0
he said : ' it was addressed here so i just opened it as normal and it contained very personal details about this man 's sexual problems			0
' it was a bit of a shock and obviously those details were very personal and confidential			0
' my obvious worry is that should this sort of information fall into the wrong hands then it would leave the person described open to blackmail			0
' mr @entity6 contacted the @entity39 , which apologised , and he returned the letter			0
but more letters arrived and , after one was picked up by a messenger , mr @entity6 was given a batch of pre-paid envelopes to return any more			2
