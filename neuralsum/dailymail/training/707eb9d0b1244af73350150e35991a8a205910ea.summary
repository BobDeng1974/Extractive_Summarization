@entity1 's first goal for @entity2 handed them victory over @entity4			1
click here see the stats behind the game with our @entity8			0
eventually , when it came to @entity4 conceding a goal , there was little they could do about it			1
eight hours and eight minutes had lapsed on the watch , their net having been safely guarded for almost two months , when @entity1 sensed trouble as everybody else stood and watched			1
@entity21 sent a hopeless volley towards goal , @entity20 failed to react and the full - back , signed from @entity25 in the summer , crept up behind him and thrashed home past goalkeeper @entity27 , who was deputising for the injured @entity28			1
it was a way befitting of winning this ; @entity2 laboured but eventually came out on top , with @entity34 ’s side being reduced to 10 men following two bookings in a minute for @entity37 after @entity1 ’s winner			1
@entity100 will shrug , point to being without a number of key players and throw a knowing nudge to the league table			2
the @entity2 are fifth , have striker @entity51 fit — winning the majority of his headers — and enjoy options from the bench			1
they may look at these three points and wonder of the significance because , make no mistake , @entity2 were second best for long spells			1
‘ it ’s a massive victory for us , ’ said @entity100			2
‘ the opposition who came here had a better run of results than @entity123 — and that ’s saying something			2
‘ to get to 21 points is huge			0
and you ’ve got to give @entity128 a huge amount of credit for his finish			0
’ but it was hard work			0
the @entity135 were impressively tenacious in hunting down possession and know that , in @entity88 , they finally have a man to hit — something to have gone missing since @entity51 upped sticks to @entity52 for £ 35million three years ago			0
it was @entity88 who dragged an early effort wide after inventive work from @entity84 and flicked just wide from @entity87 ’s near - post cross			0
@entity51 had a rather optimistic shout for handball turned down when his volley struck @entity80 half a yard away			2
but @entity2 had offered little , appearing to be missing the creativity and brute force of @entity152 and @entity153 , who both offer something different , something @entity100 has not been afforded throughout his time in charge at @entity159			1
without them — and the equally important @entity161 — they lack some intuition on the ball			0
even when four on three and breaking at pace , @entity67 could only fire over the top			0
it is by no means @entity51 ’s fault but he is too easy a target			0
there is not the need to take risks in midfield and it makes for occasional sterility going forward			0
tension of old crept in as @entity4 grew into the game further and there were cries of exasperation when the galavanting @entity128 had a rush of blood and ballooned a wild effort over the bar			1
but in a game lacking genuine quality , fittingly a mis - hit settled things			0

‘ it just fell nicely for him and you sensed one goal would be enough , ’ said @entity34 , after seeing his side ’s six - game winning streak end abruptly			1
one would have been enough for them and it should have come			0
@entity88 had flashed an effort straight at @entity61 and the manager brought on @entity218 in desperate need of an equaliser , but they ran out of ideas			2
and down to 10 , too			0
@entity37 allowed frustration to get the better of him when @entity59 correctly adjudged he had fouled @entity62 , booting the ball 60 yards away and seeing yellow			1
not a minute later , he was throwing himself at @entity51 and that was that			0
@entity34 lowered his head and shook the midfielder ’s hand as he trudged off			1
‘ he has lost his mind a little bit , ’ said @entity34			2
‘ it ’s not like @entity37 , he has been outstanding for us			2
he will apologise to @entity51			0
the glorious run since the beginning of october , to have propelled @entity4 into @entity238 contention , was done with a mis - hit and moment of madness			1
and it was topped off by a stoppage - time swing of @entity218 ’s boot to send the ball flying into the sir @entity245			0
