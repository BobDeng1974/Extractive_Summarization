the couple that models designer clothes together stays together — or at least that 's what one @entity2 - based duo hope , having just inked a deal as the first openly gay couple with @entity6			1
@entity7 , 22 , and @entity8 , 25 , go by the @entity10 - like portmanteau @entity9 , and have already earned a following in the modeling world and on @entity2 's party scene			1
but while the male model it couple have starred in a campaign together for @entity19 and posed for big brands like @entity21 and @entity22 , they say it has n't always been easy for them to work in the industry and be true to themselves			0
model couple : @entity8 , 25 , left , and @entity7 , 22 , right , are the first openly gay couple to be signed together to a modeling agency though the fashion industry seems very accepting of gay people , the couple explains that models are still expected to appear masculine or androgynous			1
both @entity7 and @entity8 had to drop their old agencies after they were told to act straight and delete the @entity36 account they share , where they often post loving images of themselves kissing and hugging			1
' after coming out , i did n’t want to be weird about it again and act straight at castings , ' @entity7 told the cut in december			0
' the weird thing about models — something that nobody really realizes — is that they ’re all straight , ' @entity8 recently told out magazine			0
growing fan base : on @entity36 , the couple goes by the joint nickname @entity50 , and they have over 22,500 followers facing obstacles : @entity7 and @entity8 were told by their previous modeling agencies to act more ' butch ' and delete their joint @entity36 account , where they often pose kissing and holding hands ' there is an unspoken rule of modeling , at least in @entity2 — even if you get signed as an out model — the first thing any agent tells you to do is to dress butch and talk about girls so no one " finds out " , ' @entity7 added			1
in fact , when the couple first got together over three years after meeting at a casting call , it was because @entity8 became interested in @entity7 when he realized he might be gay — which he says was unusual			1
soon the pair became well - known on the @entity2 party scene , getting snapped with celebrities like model @entity75 and @entity77 , djing at trendy clubs , and even curating art shows			2
' we used to sneak into parties we were n’t invited to at all and try to take pictures of famous people , ' @entity7 said			0
' now we ’re invited and covering it and djing			0
' looking good : the couple explained that though the modeling industry is filled with well - groomed , well - dressed men , most male models are straight party hard : @entity9 is well known on the @entity2 party circuit and has been pictured with @entity75 , @entity77 , and @entity90 the fact that the pair has become so widely known as a couple made them even more appealing to @entity6			1
' we signed them as a duo because they are both models and they @entity99 as a duo , under the name @entity9 , ' @entity6 's @entity95 told @entity102			0
' they ’ve made a name for themselves as a team , so we decided to run with it			0
' as for @entity7 and @entity8 , they are as excited to be making strides for gay models as they are to have signed this new deal			2
' finally being represented as an openly gay man , let alone a couple , is a huge milestone for the industry , and the whole gay community , ' @entity7 said			2
' we hope that this will send a message to younger generations that it 's possible to succeed without compromising who you are			0
