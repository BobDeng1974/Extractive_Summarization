by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity2 was ‘ running for everything ’ as he settled into his blocks for the start of the men ’s 100 metres at @entity7 ’s @entity6 just before 4.20pm on sunday he was running for his fifth consecutive @entity9 title and the chance to represent his country at august ’s @entity12 in @entity13 but , at 36 , he was also running for his career			1
and , despite the country ’s rich seam of young sprinting talent , it was the veteran performer who claimed victory — yet again			1
chambers powered out of his blocks in lane four , surging past new sub- 10 - seconds man @entity23 to his right , and held off a late push from @entity26 to become @entity9 champion for the eighth time , in 10.12sec			1
there are those — and plenty of them — who still point to @entity35 ’ chequered past and the two - year ban he served for doping but , although you may still wish to deride him , you must never discount him			1
he drew barely a mention in the build - up to sunday ’s final and he used it to his advantage , quietly ticking off the rounds with wins in 10.34 and 10.12 , then reproducing a season ’s best when it mattered most			1
surely now , nearly 11 years after he gave the urine test that has defined his career , it is finally time to celebrate an experienced , wily championship performer who simply refuses to go away			1
@entity35 climbed @entity67 for charity last year and continues to scale improbable peaks time and again			1
his victory guarantees him a place at the @entity12 , where he first won a 100m silver in 1998 , and now he wants to bow out with one more individual medal after only being selected to represent @entity74 in the 4 x 100m relay at the @entity76			1
it could prove to be quite an emotional swansong of a summer			2
training partners : chambers and @entity23 know each other well but as @entity23 said , ' experience won ' @entity35 said : ‘ it did cross my mind ( that this could be it )			1
you could say i was running for my career			2
i was running for everything			2
doubts do cross your mind but you have to learn to just remove them			2
when that gun went “ bang ” everything disappeared			2
‘ i thought : “ just get out of the blocks			2
if i get out , the pressure is on them , then all i ’ve got to do is run in a straight line ”			2
that ’s what i did			2
i ran as fast and as hard as i could			0
‘ i ’ve climbed many mountains , have n’t i ? and fallen down a few			0
but i still keep standing			0
i ’m the @entity101 of track and field			0
’ @entity35 has been training with @entity23 , already the third quickest @entity104 in history at 20 years old , but the veteran ’s victory leaves the youngster ’s participation in the @entity12 up in the air			1
@entity35 ’ and @entity26 ’s places are assured after they finished first and second on sunday and ran inside the qualifying time of 10.20 , but @entity23 must trust the selectors ’ discretion when they meet on july 14			1
over the top : @entity35 kept his composure to clock 10.12 seconds as favourite @entity23 finished third the 9.96 man has already missed out on a place at the @entity121 and must hope @entity122 can not repeat his 9.91 form of last year in a ‘ b ’ race in @entity125 on thursday , then at the @entity127 meeting in @entity128 on july 11			1
@entity122 suffered a hamstring injury in february and is yet to open his outdoor season			0
@entity23 said : ‘ i would have loved to win it but experience came through in the end			1
i adapted to someone else ’s rhythm			0
i did n’t feel the pressure at all , but i got a bit of cramp in my hip flexor and i was kind of panicking a bit			0
the @entity142 are out of my hands now , so i will just have to wait and see			0
i would love to be selected			0
’ earlier at the @entity145 ’s @entity9 championships on sunday , @entity146 , 23 , ran 11.11 to win the women ’s 100m , with @entity149 and 200m champion @entity150 recording the same time — 11.15 — in second and third respectively			0
the 3.6 metres per second illegal wind , however , meant their personal best times will not count , but @entity155 and @entity156 are guaranteed their places in @entity13 , with @entity150 assured of at least a 200m berth			0
representing : @entity35 now qualifies for the @entity12 in @entity13 in august @entity159 , 21 , also has the option to contest the long jump , high jump or both at the @entity12 — which take place less than two weeks after she goes for heptathlon gold at the @entity76			1
@entity159 finished second in the high jump on saturday and then won the long jump on sunday , leaping an outdoor personal best of 6.81 metres to add the @entity9 outdoor title to the @entity142 indoor silver she won in march			1
a huge leap — potentially breaking @entity174 ’s @entity9 record of 6.95m — remains a distinct possibility this season if the @entity178 athlete can bring her right leg in line with her left after take - off			0
‘ it ’s trailing a lot , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s about 20cm , which i was trying to work on throughout			0
‘ i ’m happy with the distance but there ’s definitely more to come			0
i ’ll make a decision on the @entity142 after @entity128 , i think			0
‘ i am fortunate enough to be in the good position that i can pick and choose what event to do , but i am leaning towards the long jump because i feel a lot more confident in that			0
’ versatile : @entity159 set an outdoor @entity194 on her way to winning the @entity9 long jump title setting the bar : the heptathlete can now choose between long jump , high jump and the multi-event for the @entity12			1

@entity35 finished in 10.12 seconds at the @entity6
@entity26 was second by just 0.02 seconds
@entity35 and @entity205 qualify for the @entity12
race favourite @entity23 came third in 10.18 seconds
