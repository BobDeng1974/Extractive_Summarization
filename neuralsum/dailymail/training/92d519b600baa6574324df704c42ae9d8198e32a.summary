speaking in an interview for the @entity22 think - tank @entity19 he argued that there fears over how such a practise might affect children ’s learning were ‘ misplaced			2
’ he said : ‘ i ’ve actually been in public discussions in @entity28 with women wearing full face veil , and you learn to read differently , it ’s not that those codes do n’t happen … but there ’s a cultural obstacle to overcome			1
‘ as a matter of fact i think that ’s largely a misplaced anxiety , but i can see where it comes from			1
’ his comments are set to reignite the row over the role of the controversial full - face veil in public life which have rumbled on for years			0
last year @entity47 minster @entity46 called for a national discussion about their use in some settings such as schools , fearing that young women in some @entity9 faith schools might have the veil imposed on them against their will			1
