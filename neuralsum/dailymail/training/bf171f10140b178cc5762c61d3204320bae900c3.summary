@entity0 can appreciate the romance of winning gold at the @entity3 in @entity4 , at a velodrome bearing the name of his friend sir @entity7 , the greatest track cyclist @entity8 has produced and the man he has long been tipped to succeed			1
but , pleasant as a @entity3 gold medal hanging round his neck might feel , @entity0 knows it will not put food on the table or heat the house he shares with girlfriend and fellow cyclist @entity18			1
‘ we like to race for all the romantic reasons - to be @entity3 champion - but we ’re also racing to pay the bills and the bills just are n’t really paid at the @entity3 , ’ said @entity0			1
loved up : @entity18 and @entity0 are pictured alongside @entity24 at the @entity26 volleyball helping hand : olympic gold medalists @entity18 and @entity0 are training up the next generation of budding cyclists cool heads : the pair are not overly concerned about the @entity34 team ¿ s performance at the @entity36 ‘ a lot of members of the public probably see the @entity40 as second only to the @entity41			1
but when you ’re actually involved in the sport it does n’t seem that way			2
it gets devalued a bit			2
it ’s a real grey area , but for us it does n’t fit into any kind of category			2
’ it is an admirably honest assessment of an event that critics see as antiquated and irrelevant from a sporting perspective			2
but @entity0 ’s views will come as a blow to @entity3 organisers as they try to lure the biggest stars to @entity57 this summer			1
even more worrying is the fact they appear to be shared by @entity60 , another of @entity8 ’s most - loved athletes			1
‘ a lot of people do n’t even take it seriously , ’ she told @entity66 , ‘ it ’s the same with a lot of countries			2
i went to @entity69 ( @entity3 ) as a youngster ( in 2010 ) and there was barely anyone there			1
it ’s not the same as a @entity74 and it ’s certainly not the same as an @entity41			2
’ both @entity0 and @entity60 recognise the financial benefits of winning gold at the @entity41			1
they took home two each at @entity26 , a glorious fortnight that concluded with their very public ‘ outing ’ as a couple , when a picture emerged of them kissing while watching the beach volleyball sat behind @entity24 and next to @entity85			1
their success helped draw in sponsorship and advertising deals			0
top of the track : @entity0 and @entity60 took home two golds each at @entity26 not convinced : @entity60 is unsure about the petition by @entity41 team - mate @entity92 for a women ¿ s @entity94 ‘ it ’s the only time you get that kind of exposure , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ for other sports they get lots of exposure between the four years but for us , every four years track cycling comes to the forefront and it ’s important for us to put on a big show			1
’ they are back at the @entity109 almost two years on , in their role as ambassadors for @entity113 mentorship programme , training up the next generation of budding cyclists			0
although they do n’t talk about their relationship in public , they have a natural rapport , batting ideas off each other			0
the pair are not overly concerned about the @entity34 team ’s performance at the @entity36 in @entity126 in march where their five medal haul fell two short of head coach @entity129 ’s target			0
‘ @entity132 put a lot of emphasis on the @entity41 so if we did n’t win another gold medal until the @entity3 in @entity137 , they ’d prefer it than for us to win four gold medals and then lose at the @entity3 , ’ said @entity60 , who won silver in the omnium at the @entity74			1
‘ we peak for the @entity41 , we get all the equipment and everything thrown at us for the @entity41 whereas for the @entity74 we do n’t get all that			0
so you ’re definitely going to see dips in performance			0
’ the men came home without any medals but @entity0 , 26 , is fierce in his belief that gender is irrelevant in @entity132 ’s success			1
‘ medals are medals no matter who wins them and what sex they are , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ if you want equality , which i ’m assuming most women do , then you ca n’t say , “ we won all the gold medals ” when you do			1
@entity18 ’s gold medals are worth just as much as mine			1
i think sport ’s a good equaliser in that sense			0
’ partners : @entity60 and @entity0 live together and regularly train together @entity60 , 22 , came 55th in the inaugural women ’s tour earlier this month , a professional women ’s road race on an unprecedented scale in @entity8			1
she said : ‘ i think it ’s a great step			0
it ’s quite smart to say we do n’t want it to run alongside the men ’s race			0
i think women ’s road race will continue to grow			2
it ’s slowly getting bigger and it ’s nice that @entity180 is leading the way			0
’ @entity60 also endorses @entity182 by @entity94 , a one - day stage at the finish of the @entity94 for women road racers but stops short of getting behind the petition by @entity41 teammate @entity92 and @entity189 @entity41 road race champion @entity187 for a women ’s @entity94			1
she says : ‘ i ’m not so swayed on the whole @entity94 idea			2
they do have a stage race ( @entity182 ) but some women do n’t agree with it because it does n’t go up the classic hills			2
but i just do n’t think it should run along the same course as the men ’s because we would never , ever complete 300km			0
you ’d get two riders rolling in after 10 hours			0
' ‘ there ’d be deaths , ’ @entity0 predicts			1
golden girls : @entity208 , @entity60 and @entity209 of @entity8 pose with their medals at @entity26 ‘ i just do n’t think it would be realistic , ’ adds @entity60 , ‘ we ride a tour for five days and at the end of it we ’re completely knackered			1
for three weeks - no chance			0
i certainly would n’t finish , put it that way			0
’ as for the young girls @entity60 has been mentoring , she insists there are far more positive female role models to inspire them than there were a decade ago			2
‘ at the @entity41 there was a lot of female medal winners so they have a lot of women to look up to , ’ said @entity60 , ‘ ten years ago , there were n’t as many			1
for me personally , when i was a child , i could play with what i wanted			0
' if i wanted to play with an action man , my parents would go buy me an action man			0
it was n’t stereotyped like that in our family			0
i guess sport in itself has always been a male - dominated thing so it is a little more equal now that there are more role models			0
‘ if a lady wants to go in the kitchen then she can but if she wants to go on a dirt bike then she can do that too			0
’ @entity18 and @entity0 are training up the next generation of budding cyclists as part of the @entity113 mentorship initiative			1
four children from across the @entity34 were given a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to train with @entity8 ’s best at the @entity255			0
the unique experience will be shown on @entity257 , @entity258 and www.disney.co.uk/aimhigh from may 26 .			0

@entity0 and @entity18 will compete at the @entity3
he *revealed* that @entity4 medals will not be financially *rewarding*
@entity0 and @entity60 took home two golds each at @entity26
@entity60 has her *doubts* about petition to introduce a women *'s* @entity94
@entity0 said , ' there would be deaths ' were it to be introduced
