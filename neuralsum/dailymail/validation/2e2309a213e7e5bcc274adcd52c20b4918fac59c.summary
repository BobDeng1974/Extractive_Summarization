there 's a first time for everything , is n't there ? first time in a new country			1
first time you go on a holiday that leaves you speechless			1
and the first time you take one of those ' selfies ' that everyone is talking about			1
the country was @entity11 , which has just started opening up to touris , and since the best way to see the sights is by taking a river cruise , i booked up for a few nights onboard			1
' a floating paradise ' : a river cruise on the @entity20 was the best way to see the sights the brochure promised enchantment and luxury , along with the chance to experience this fascinating land close up			1
i have to say , they were true to their promise			1
the boat , @entity20 , is basically a floating paradise			2
the first thing i did when i got to my cabin was throw open the @entity35 doors and step on to the veranda			2
the second thing was to clamber on to the fluffy nest of a bed and enjoy the sight of a new world sliding past my windows			2
at this point , i promised myself that one day i would lie there and watch the sunrise			2
next morning , thanks to jet lag , that 's exactly what i did			2
it was so superb , i set my alarm so i could enjoy it every day			2
ox - cart ride anyone ? @entity54 enjoyed his bumpy ride in the back of the taxi the only way to see the temples ...			1
from a balloon our guide later explained that the owners of @entity20 , obviously aware of the negative impact tourism can sometimes have on real lives like these , are working with the village elders to plan for the future			1
the first fruits of this philanthropic project are a full - time teacher and a library in the village			2
the next few days passed in a blur of excitement			2
we stopped off to explore ancient ruins and temples that were still very much in use			1
one day i found myself wandering along a dusty path , wilting in the heat			2
i hailed a passing ox cart , which had the word ' taxi ' scrawled on the side , and got a delightfully bumpy lift back to the shore			1
next morning i was up before the sun had even thought about rising			2
i could n't sleep , and could n't face breakfast			0
truth be told , i could hardly stop myself from doing a dance			0
i live in @entity92 , which is pretty much home of the hot air balloon			1
i 've always wanted to go up in one of these outsized cuddly toys , but for one reason or another i 've never got round to it			0
so there i was , on a gorgeous boat in a land of loveliness , crossing my fingers for good ballooning weather			1
luckily , the wind stayed away and the captain announced that conditions were perfect			0
a few of us scampered up the bank and climbed into a vintage coach that would carry us to the take - off field			0
the balloon sighed into the sky just in time for the sun to rise over the 2,000 temples of @entity116			1
as balloon rides go , it was magical			1
the early morning sunlight shone through the mist , picking out temples and pagodas with golden sparks			1
that was when i decided it was time for my first selfie			0
i 'm not saying it was the best picture i 've ever taken , but it is definitely one click i am never going to forget			0
days were spent exploring ancient ruins and temples that are still very much in use bagan at dusk : the ancient capital of @entity11 has more than 2,200 @entity137 temples and pagodas on our last evening we were treated to a candlelit feast under the night sky			1
as i sat there thinking nothing could improve my world , a flurry of shooting stars whooshed overhead			0
moments later , a harvest moon peeped over the horizon , lighting up the river			1
i actually had to pinch myself to make sure i was n't dreaming			0
our host , @entity150 , saw my dazed look and asked if i could think of any way , no matter how big or small , in which the company could improve my holiday experience			0
i 'll be honest , i tried			0
i gave it my full attention			0
i desperately tried to think of something i would have changed			0
but i could n't think of a thing			0
not a single , solitary one			0
i had to turn to @entity150 and admit the truth			0
it had been the perfect holiday			0
