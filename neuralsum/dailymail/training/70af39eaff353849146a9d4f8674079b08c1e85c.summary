by @entity0 @entity1 is looking forward to a hero ’s welcome in @entity4 this weekend and hoping to parade both his major championship trophies at @entity7 on saturday			1
‘ i ’ll definitely be at the first game of the season with the @entity12 and while i do n’t know if i can parade the @entity13 at the same time , i will try , ’ said the @entity9 fan			1
@entity1 made it two majors in four weeks with his gripping , one - stroke victory in the @entity18 on sunday and will spend the next few days trying to keep his feet on the ground			1
‘ i ’m trying not to think about my place in the game because if you start thinking like that ... ’ said @entity1 , his voice trailing off			1
i ’m level with @entity40 and @entity41 who are both in the @entity42 , so it is pretty lofty company already			2
the next one would be huge to pull off because then i ’d be alongside @entity38 and @entity45			2
it ’s too much to think about			0
’ there ’s no rest for @entity1			2
after this week he will be back in @entity49 for four weeks and the @entity51 play - offs — he is the runaway leader for the $ 10million bonus			1
then it is on to the @entity30 in 45 days where he is ready to assume the role of team leader			1
asked if he thinks he will be a target for the @entity49 , he replied : ‘ i think it ’s not only their team who will view me in those terms but my own as well			0
it ’s only my third @entity30 but i am ready to be the talisman and drive us forward			1
i realise i have that responsibility and i am comfortable with it			0
in my first two i felt out of place offering an opinion but i realise i have a place in the game now that warrants that			0
i know i can lead this team			0
centre of attention : the in - form @entity75 has now won two consecutive majors ‘ i do n’t know whether seeing my name on the @entity13 leaderboard affected the other players but you have to think it counted for something , especially after how i have been playing			1
it is another thing to have in my locker			0
it was a great feeling to win in a dogfight because i ’d never done that before in a major			2
‘ i think satisfaction and joy are the two things i am most feeling right now			0
i said at @entity93 i was determined to keep going forward			0
i never thought it would happen in my wildest dreams and i know i will probably never have another summer like it			0
’ @entity49 @entity30 captain @entity97 said : ‘ i just wish he was on my team			2
he is making the game look easy — he knows it and the rest know it			0
’ leading the way : @entity1 is on target to become on of the game 's greatest players following his latest triumph @entity108 will pick @entity109 if fit			1

@entity1 hoping to parade @entity12 and @entity13 at @entity7
