by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 10 october 2013 famed @entity2 coach @entity1 has revealed that his biggest regret was deciding not to run against @entity4 for the open @entity6 seat in 2004			1
' biggest mistake i ’ve ever made			0
not that i would have won , but i probably would have and he would n’t be in the @entity9 , ' @entity1 said at a recent event			1
@entity1 is a legend in the state as he was a player for the @entity13 football team during their 1963 championship season and then came back to coach the team , leading them to their most recent championship as coach in 1986			1
putting their differences aside : president @entity4 hosted the 1985 @entity13 team , which @entity1 coached , to the @entity9 in 2011 since they did not get their original ceremony in 1986 due to the @entity25 explosion in 2004 , @entity26 senator @entity26 left the federal government and @entity28 was seen as the @entity30 front runner for much of the campaign			1
@entity32 reports that @entity28 ended up dropping out with little time left in the race after legal papers revealed that he and his ex-wife went to sex clubs and he asked her to perform sex acts in front of other patrons			0
@entity28 subsequently dropped out of the race and the local @entity30 political machine called on @entity1 to run			1
' he ’s enormously popular			0
i think if he gets in , he immediately becomes a favorite , ' then - @entity43 nominee @entity4 said at the time , according to @entity46			2
@entity1 's high approval ratings along with his self - described ' ultra- ultra-ultra conservative ' political leanings would have made him an ideal candidate for the party , but he decided against it			1
citing his wife 's disapproval of a run and his business obligations , @entity1 formally announced that he would not be the @entity30 candidate just four months before the election			1
his biggest regret : @entity1 was pushed by the local @entity30 machine in 2004 to run against virtual unknown @entity4 for the open @entity6 seat in @entity61 but in july he announced that he would not run ( pictured ) that same month , @entity4 gave the keynote address at the @entity63 where @entity64 was formally nominated as the party 's presidential candidate			1
the speech was well received , launching him onto the national politcal scene and helping secure his landslide victory against his @entity30 challenger , former ambassador @entity70			2
one term later , @entity4 was elected president , and four years after that he was re-elected , bringing us back to present day			2
now , while attending an oil field opening ceremony in @entity76 , @entity1 lamented on his decision though he still seems fairly content with the life he has			0
' if somebody would have told me 40 years ago they ’d pay you to be on tv , i would have said " you ’re crazy , " ' @entity1 said according to the @entity84			0
well - versed : @entity1 is one of two people in @entity2 history to win a title as a player , assistant coach , and head coach ( seen at left in 1963 and at right in 1982 as coach ) ' they pay me to be on tv and talk about something i like to talk about , football			2
' the two men have clearly put their differences aside since @entity1 had some kind words for the president when he honored the @entity102 team at the @entity9 in 2011			2
they were initially supposed to have a ceremony in the year after their victory , but the challenger space shuttle explosion cancelled those plans			0
' on behalf of the 1985 @entity13 , we consider him one of us			0
we 're very proud that you honored us by bringing us here			0
it 's only 26 years after the fact , and five administrations , but thank you , ' @entity1 said at the ceremony , according to @entity114			0

famed @entity13 coach @entity1 was seen as a possible @entity30 candidate for the @entity6 seat in 2004
@entity1 is a self - described ' ultra- ultra-ultra conservative ' and he would have been running against the then - state senator @entity4
chose not to because his wife was against it and his business obligations
now says that is his biggest regret : ' not that i would have won , but i probably would have and he would *n't* be in the @entity9 '
