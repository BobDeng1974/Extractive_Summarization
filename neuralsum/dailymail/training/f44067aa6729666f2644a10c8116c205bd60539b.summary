the musician , 66 , branded residents of the west @entity13 suburb ' selfish ' , and said they had ' declared war ' on his family through constant construction work in his once ' nice quiet decent ' neighbourhood			1
writing on the ' @entity18 ' section of his own website , may said he regularly lost sleep and could no longer enjoy sitting in his garden thanks to noise from the machines used by builders			1
may seemed particularly put - out by the presence in his neighborhood of piling rigs , which he described as ' an instrument of torture '			1
he said his life has been dominated by the ' infernal machines ' over the last four months , leaving him unable to find anywhere in his home to escape the noise , despite some of the rooms being triple - glazed			0
' whom would a peaceful person like myself fantasise about making suffer ? well that would be the people who have passed sentence on me without me having committed a crime - the people who have declared war on me and my family , to whom i had done no harm , ' may wrote on his website about the noise			1
' the builders , of course , are only doing their job , and , though it would be nice if they acted in a considerate manner , it 's the owners of the property who are the ones who are really guilty of this of this monstrous invasion of my life , ' he added			0
' these people decided that they 'd increase the value of their house by building a basement which is the whole area of the garden , and two stories deep , ' may went on to say			0
he was referring to the common practice of building large basement conversions in properties in the @entity13 borough of @entity6 and @entity6 - a type of construction the local council are under pressure from long - term residents to reduce			1

famous friends : earlier this week @entity0 ( right ) was joined by @entity111 ( left ) and @entity112 ( second from right ) at the unveiling of new mural by @entity117 sleeve artist sir @entity116 ( second from left ) ' we are stressed , angry , constantly irritated , and wracked by feelings of powerlessness - this is exactly the kind of long - term stress that causes damage to health , ' he said			2
may said he is concerned that he may have to leave @entity6 if the noise continues and urged locals to rally together and launch a joint legal action against those building basement conversions			2
