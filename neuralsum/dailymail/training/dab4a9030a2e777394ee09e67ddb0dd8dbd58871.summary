@entity0 has ' masses of space ' and the issue of immigration is ' not very important ' , a senior member of the independent economic watchdog has claimed			1
@entity7 , a board member of the @entity8 , said just 10 per cent of the country has been ' urbanised '			1
and he warned the @entity10 would be in ' dire straits ' without the influx of migrant workers to take jobs			2
@entity7 , a member of the @entity8 board , told mps that there is ' plenty of space ' in @entity0 latest figures show that net migration is rising , with 260,000 more people arriving in the @entity0 in the year to june than left			1
the issue is set to dominate next year 's general election campaign , with all the parties promising to act on curbing benefits which can act as a ' pull factor ' to attract @entity29 nationals to @entity0			1
but mr @entity7 told mps that while new arrivals had held down unskilled wages ' to some extent ' but the overall impact was marginal			1
the former economics professor at @entity36 and the @entity37 was giving evidence to the @entity39			2
mr @entity7 said : ' it 's perfectly true , i think , from the evidence that the pay of unskilled workers , particularly in the service sector , has been held back to some extent - not a massive extent , but to some extent - by unskilled immigration ... ' at the end of the day - let 's say over the next 10 years or so - the general consensus is that for the native population , the existing population , immigration may be a little bit good , it may be a little bit bad economically			1
but there is n't overall that much in it			2
' giving evidence to the treasury select committee , mr @entity7 warned the @entity10 would be in ' dire straits ' with migrant workers but he stressed that the @entity10 can only survive with migrant workers			1
' obviously there are special situations like in the health service , for example - some 35 per cent of health professional are migrants			0
' it 's quite plain that , if they were n't there , the health service would be in absolutely dire straits			0
' last month @entity73 , the @entity75 ambassador to the @entity0 , revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in @entity75 to return home , declaring : ‘ we want them back			0
’ @entity81 has pledged to work with other @entity29 countries to reduce migration across the continent , warning public services in @entity0 are struggling to cope with rising populations			1
but mr @entity7 suggested that large parts of the country are far from full , and able to cope with more new arrivals			1
he said the argument about immigration , ' basically boils down to people , the number of people '			2
' the evidence suggests that , since more immigrants mean more housing , more roads , more airports , more incinerators , more more more of this being required			0
' and since the evidence would suggest that people by and large do n't like these things - especially if they are near them - i think that is the key issue about immigration that people may wish to face up to			1
' mr @entity7 went on : ' one argument says ' we are a small island , not much room '			1
' on the other hand , of course - there is masses of room			0
the urbanised part of @entity0 occupies less than 10 per cent of the surface area			0
' the urbanised part of @entity121 occupies less of @entity121 than golf courses			0
so in some senses , plenty of space			0
' but as you know , explaining the situation ... there 's plenty of room , these issues are really not very important , it does n't get you very far			2
this is not the way people think about these things			0
' people think about these things on the basis of their experience and what they read in the newspapers			0
' most of the things that people object to arise because there are just more people			0
' fears over immigration have been widely credited with fuelling the recent surge in support for @entity150 , which saw the party top @entity153 polls and win two commons by - elections			2
before the last election , mr @entity81 pledged to reduce net annual immigration below 100,000 by the general election , but figures released last month showed it is running at 260,000			1
the prime minister has said he will use a mooted renegotiation of @entity0 's @entity29 membership terms to tackle ' pull ' factors - including banning newcomers from claiming tax credits for four years .			0
