by @entity1 reporter published : 15:44 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 17:12 est , 23 october 2013 he may have missed his chance at moving into the @entity4 but wealthy former presidential candidate @entity5 is certainly making sure there is some old school intrigue to his latest property venture			1
an overview of the floor plans to the @entity5 family 's new vacation house in @entity13 , @entity14 , has found a small 11 - foot - by - 5 - foot room hidden behind a bookshelf in the study			1
with @entity5 planning to tear down the home that currently sits on the land , blueprints for the soon - to - be - constructed house show the secret passageway is twice as long as it is wide , with the entry ominously marked in the documents as ' hidden door '			1
a fake bookcase would swing open into the study to get into the secret room			0
the special alcove runs along the back of the ' coat room ' and ' powder room ' and is not far from the main entryway			0
the plans show the room is lined with cabinets			2
' x ' marks the spot : architectural layout drawings of @entity5 's soon - to - be - built home in @entity13 , @entity41 , show plans for a ' hidden door ' and secret room just off the study and sequestered behind shelving wider view of the floorplan of @entity5 's new vacation home in @entity13 , a suburb within @entity14			1
the blueprints show how the ' hidden door ' is accessed from the study , with the secret room sitting behind the coat room and ' powder room ' ( bathroom ) the enormous property is set to start building any day now			1
@entity5 's study features a book case that swivels open and leads into secret room , the @entity60 reports , based on records it obtained storage or safe haven ? floorplans uncovered for the new house @entity5 is building in @entity41 show a hidden room will be built behind the study			1
fake bookshelves , perhaps like the one pictured here , will mark the doorway to the room , which will be twice as long as it is wide			0
the plans mark it as being used for ' office storage ' so what 's the plan , guys ? @entity5 and wife @entity80 have declined to comment about the blueprints of their new house in @entity13 , @entity14 , which have revealed a hidden room front of house : despite being of decent size already , @entity5 and his wife @entity80 will tear down this home they bought in @entity13 - their second @entity41 property - and build something that will better fit their huge family			1
' that ¿ s a good - size house , but he has a lot of grandkids so he needs a place to host everybody , ' said @entity99 , chief executive of the @entity100 of @entity101			0
the @entity60 , which discovered the room by getting access to the floor plans through an open records request , said it has been marked for ' office storage '			0
however the @entity107 has suggested the obvious explanation is that the space would be used as a ' panic room '			2
' if we learned anything from the first decade of the 21st century , it 's that fancy houses have special rooms in which residents can hide in the event of a home invasion , ' @entity111 reported			0
' since the @entity5 's had to give up their @entity120 protection last november , it only makes sense that the family would go out of its way to ensure its safety			1
' a spokeswoman for @entity5 declined to comment on the room			2
panic rooms were made famous by a 2002 thriller starring @entity130 , about a mother and daughter who buy a @entity134 brownstone only to be attacked by burglars the night they move in			0
the movie , simply called @entity137 , was inspired by a news story at the time about the rise in popularity of fortified rooms being built in grand residences as a safe shelter or hiding place for the owners , according to director @entity147			0
the 5,900 - square - foot @entity13 house will be the fifth home for the former @entity151 candidate and his wife @entity80 , who have five sons and 23 grandchildren			1
leafy oasis : the @entity13 vacation house lies at the end of this secluded driveway sold : the @entity5 's only recently bought the property from @entity160 @entity5 recently bought an expansive log cabin in the @entity41 mountain resort of @entity163 that was on the market for $ 8.9 million , reports @entity165			1
in 2009 @entity5 sold a similar mansion he had owned in the same area for 14 years			0
the new @entity41 abode was built in 1991 and features six bedrooms , eight bathrooms and over 8,700 square feet of space			2
the listing described it as : ' as featured in @entity176 , this ‘ @entity175 ’ home gave renowned local architect @entity177 the opportunity to stretch beyond what one assumed could normally be achieved in log construction			0
comprised of whole logs and many local materials , interior designer @entity183 created an interior that invites both grand entertaining and cozy relaxation			0
the architectural design is centered on the two - story great room with massive stone fireplace and magnificent views to the @entity191 and beyond			0
' following much controversy , the @entity192 decided earlier this month to allow the @entity5 's to move forward with plans to raze their @entity196 beachfront home and replace it with an 11,000 - square - foot mansion			1
a neighbour had complained the house would be too big and block the beach views of other residents this current house will be torn down for the new uber - home to be built @entity5 's third house , in the coastal @entity207 town of @entity196 , north of @entity208 , has been a recent source of contention			1
the politico had planned to tear down the existing 3,000 - square - foot home he bought in 2008 for $ 12 million and build a whopping 11,000 - square - foot dream home			1
however the plans were stalled on the complaint of a neighbor , who believed the home would be too big			0
on oct. 11 @entity5 was given the go - ahead after it was concluded the ' vast majority of the square footage will be contained in the basement and first floor ' and that the house would not impede on public views along the beach it overlooks			2
rounding out his property portfolio , @entity5 also has a cabin in @entity230 and a condo in @entity232 , @entity233			1
@entity5 's bid to be president came up short when he lost to @entity236 in the 2012 election			2
he has spoken previously about how , when first starting out , he lived in an apartment too small for a dining room table and that he ate dinner off an ironing board			0
@entity242 recently released a new cookbook , ' the @entity244 ' , in which she writes about recipes and the food shared by the family through the ups and downs of their lives			2
