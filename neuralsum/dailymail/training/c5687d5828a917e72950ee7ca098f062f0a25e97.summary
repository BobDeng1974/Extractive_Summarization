four bronze angels which were built for @entity2 's tomb but vanished into obscurity for nearly 500 years are being bought for the nation - at a price of £ 2.8million			1
the opulent metre - high statues were made for @entity8 's chief adviser in 1524 but disappeared after he fell out of the king 's favour , at one point adorning the gateposts of a country manor			1
now the popularity of @entity17 drama @entity15 , based on @entity20 's double @entity19 - winning book series , has helped thrust the sculptures into the limelight - and raised £ 87,000 from the public			1
@entity2 fell out of favour with @entity8 and his tomb was never finished @entity27 's @entity26 has raised £ 2.8million in all to acquire the works , led by a £ 2million grant from the @entity41			1
the @entity42 contributed another £ 500,000 , the friends of the @entity26 gave £ 200,000 and of the public fundraising , £ 33,000 came from the sale of @entity47 badges in the museum shop			1
@entity26 director @entity49 said : ' the @entity47 are a vital part of our national history and artistic heritage			2
' we are very grateful to everyone who contributed to our fundraising appeal to ensure these outstanding sculptures , which were thought to be lost , are reunited and preserved at the @entity26 for future generations			0
' drama : the campaign was given a boost by @entity15 , in which @entity2 is played by @entity62 played by @entity62 in the @entity17 adaptation of @entity15 , cardinal @entity2 amassed considerable power in the early 1500s as one of @entity8 's closest confidantes			1
but the pair fell out after the king 's infamous attempt to annul his marriage with his first wife , @entity71 , because she had not produced a healthy son			0
@entity2 appealed for an annulment to @entity75 , based partly on the claim that @entity71 was not a virgin when she married @entity8 - a claim she denied			0
caught in an international deadlock between @entity8 and @entity71 's powerful nephew , the holy roman emperor @entity81 , the @entity75 delayed the decision and @entity2 was stripped of many of his offices in 1529			0
he died just a year later mid-way through a journey to @entity27 , where he was due to face accusations of treason			0
work on the angels had already started six years earlier in 1524 , but the magnificent @entity92 - style tomb @entity2 had planned would never be erected			0
the four bronzes were commissioned from the @entity95 sculptor @entity94 , who made them between 1524 and 1529			0
along with the rest of @entity2 's possessions and his planned tomb , the angels was appropriated by @entity8 who intended to use them for himself			2
@entity94 was commissioned to complete the tomb and he established himself at @entity103 , where he employed founders and other craftsmen			0
however , progress was halting and @entity8 did not see the tomb finished			1
each of @entity8 's three children expressed the intention to complete the memorial after he died , but they also failed to do so			2
battle : the @entity113 fell out with @entity8 ( played in the @entity17 drama by @entity115 , right ) after he failed to persuade the @entity75 to annul the king 's marriage so he could marry @entity118 ( played by @entity119 , left ) shifting power : @entity121 as @entity122 and @entity119 as @entity118 in the @entity17 adaptation @entity124 moved the parts of the tomb to @entity127 in 1565 , where they stayed for 80 years until parts were sold to raise money during the @entity132			1
only a black stone chest - which now houses @entity135 's remains at @entity136 - was known to have survived until two of the angels appeared at auction in 1994			0
unillustrated and catalogued only as ' in @entity141 ' , they were acquired by a @entity143 art dealer and later the @entity145 scholar @entity144 attributed them to @entity94			0
the other two angels were discovered in 2008 at @entity148 , @entity149 - where all four had once perched atop the country manor 's magnificent gateposts			1
during the fundraising campaign , all four unevenly weathered angels were reunited for the first time since 1988 in the @entity26 's @entity155			2
they remain there and will now stay in the museum , where they will be conserved and made to look as similar as they did in the day of @entity8 unlikely home : the four statues once stood upon the gateposts at @entity148 in @entity149 new home : they will now be preserved for the nation at the @entity26 in central @entity27 @entity166 , head of the @entity41 , said : ' many of us have been enjoying the @entity17 's production of @entity15 , which makes it even more fitting to celebrate the purchase of these extraordinary statues			1
' congratulations to the @entity26 for being so tenacious in securing their future			0
' we feel proud to have played a part too and hope that the @entity2 's @entity47 - thanks to their current high profile - will attract many admirers both now and in the future			2

metre - high works made in 1524 to show wealth of @entity8 's adviser

@entity47 vanished into obscurity until *resurfacing* in 1994 and 2008
