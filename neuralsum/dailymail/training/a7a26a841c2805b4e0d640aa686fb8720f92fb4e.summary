' i can put this behind me , and me and my family can move forward			0
' but @entity3 , who has missed the past eight games under the list 's terms , may not be able to return to the field just yet			2
@entity6 reported that the @entity0 said @entity3 will remain on the commissioner 's exempt list pending completion of the @entity0 's review process			1
this may be in violation of the initial agreement to place @entity3 on the list			2
a few hours after the @entity0 released its update , the @entity0 issued a statement demanding efficiency and consistency			0
' our union worked with the @entity0 , the @entity2 and @entity3 's representatives on a mutual agreement pending the adjudication of his legal case , ' the @entity0 said			1
' now that his legal matter is resolved , we believe it is @entity3 's right to be treated in a manner that is consistent with similar cases under our collective bargaining agreement			1

weeks after handing @entity156 a two - game suspension , @entity152 announced in august he was toughening the league 's policy on domestic violence that now calls for a six - game suspension without pay for a first domestic violence offense			0
that 's not a cut - and - dry guideline in this case with @entity3 , though , because he has maintained he intended no harm in seeking to discipline his son the way he was as a child growing up in @entity26			2
his plea was not an admission of guilt , and the felony was reduced to a misdemeanor			0
on the other hand , there 's the firestorm to consider when the @entity2 first declared on sept. 15 that @entity3 , after sitting out the home opener the day before , would remain with the team to give him his due process in the legal system			1
the boy suffered cuts , marks and bruising to his thighs , back and one of his testicles , according to court records , and backlash from the public was strong			0
