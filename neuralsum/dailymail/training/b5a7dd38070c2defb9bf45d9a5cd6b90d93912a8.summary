as the saying goes , you 're much more likely to die in a car wreck on the way to the airport than you are to die in a horrific plane crash			0
that saying is especially true for @entity8 - based @entity7 , which was named the safest airline in the world by @entity11			1
the aviation industry website notes @entity7 ' impressive record when it comes to its total number of fatal plane crashes in what it calls the ' jet era , ' which it describes as being from 1951 to the present			2
in the time period , @entity7 has had precisely zero fatal plane crashes - a fact made famous in the 1988 film @entity26 , in which @entity28 's character , @entity26 , refuses to fly on any airline other than @entity7 because of its stellar safety record			1

banned : @entity65 airline @entity64 is one of the least safe airlines on earth and is banned from flying in the @entity75 @entity76 and @entity64 are amongst a number of airlines banned from operating in the @entity75			1
