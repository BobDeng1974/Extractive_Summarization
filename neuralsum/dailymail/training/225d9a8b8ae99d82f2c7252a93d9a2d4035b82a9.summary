gunners hit for six on @entity2 's 1,000th game as @entity3 is mistakenly sent off after @entity5 's handball even after schoolyard squabbles about @entity9 cards , telescopes and specialists in failure , nothing could have stung @entity2 quite like that 6 - 0 defeat at @entity14			1
the fact that it came in his 1,000th @entity17 game when the pre-match clamour had all been about an incredible milestone only amplified the insult			1
‘ not a bad day , a horrendous day , ’ said @entity2 on friday , as memories were rekindled against his will			1
‘ it was a massive disappointment ; the lowest point of the season			2
we never forget that day			2
’ @entity17 are back at @entity28 on sunday when the @entity30 ’s unbeaten teams collide and @entity31 appears in blue against the club he left three years ago to join @entity34			1
within a year , he had seized the title as a storm raged around their contrasting footballing ideologies and economic differences of their clubs , peppered with childish insults , snubbed handshakes and unacknowledged @entity9 greetings			2
‘ when you give stupid people success if makes them more stupid , ’ tutted @entity2			1
the feud was quickly revived when @entity45 returned to the @entity30 after a six - year absence and branded wenger a ‘ specialist in failure ’ because of nine years without a trophy			2
@entity45 ( left ) gestures to his team as @entity2 looks frustrated during the 6 - 0 thrashing @entity17 players stand dejected as the @entity14 team celebrate their sixth goal of the game ‘ it was a consequence of something else , ’ said @entity45 , who made the comment in reaction to an inference from @entity2 that the @entity14 boss was afraid to declare his team in last season ’s title race because he was afraid to fail			1
‘ i did n’t get an apology			2
i do n’t apologise , ’ he added			2
‘ my feeling is to get over it and move forward			2
‘ you do n’t need to apologise			0
intelligent people do n’t need that			0
let ’s go to another match with big responsibility for both of us			0
we manage two big clubs in @entity54 and we have a responsibility not to win but to give a good match for the fans			0
’ @entity2 celebrated his 18 - year anniversary at @entity17 earlier this week with a win against @entity107 he described his relationship with @entity2 as ‘ correct ’ and ‘ normal ’ and offered his congratulations on his 18 years @entity17 , after the anniversary on wednesday			1
‘ an amazing achievement , ’ said @entity45			0
‘ congratulations to him and the club			0
it ’s not possible because he ’s a manager of quality , but it ’s a philosophy of the club			0
’ these two managers seldom pass a compliment to one another without darkening its edge			0
it is as if they spit on their palms before shaking hands or apply a ‘ kick me ’ sticker with a slap on the shoulder			0
on @entity31 , @entity45 teased about him coming ‘ home ’ and his ‘ love ’ for the ‘ blue village ’			0
how @entity17 fans react at the @entity28 would be up to them , he said , but noted how @entity14 ’s travelling fans had applauded @entity133 after he scored against them for @entity47			1
he dismissed the 6 - 0 win as ‘ once in a lifetime ’ and hailed @entity2 ’s unbeaten season in 2003 - 04 as something never to be repeated			1
‘ i do n’t see in modern football with the competitiveness of the @entity30 a team being champions without defeat , ’ said the @entity14 boss			1
‘ in my opinion that will stay in history as the last time			0
’ @entity45 has the upper hand over @entity2 - the latter is yet to win in their 11 previous head - to - heads the @entity14 boss does n't expect @entity14 to repeat last season 's 6 - 0 win against the @entity150 from north @entity54 came similar noises of forced admiration from @entity2 , now armed with another @entity153 win but the fact he has never beaten @entity45 must stick in the craw when they meet			1
‘ they had fantastic teams , ’ said the @entity17 boss			1
‘ their defence , led by @entity161 , @entity162 and others , always have good defensive records			0
let ’s not forget @entity14 won the @entity166 on good defensive stability			1
‘ this has nothing to do with individual confrontation			0
it is about team performance			2
i believe we have a good opportunity to change recent history that has been negative for us			0
in life you must always think you are there to change what happened before , or you are fatalistic			0
@entity31 ( above ) will be playing against his former club as he lines up with @entity14 on sunday @entity2 admitted they had has ' never seen a player adapt as quickly ' as @entity184 ( above ) on @entity2 ’s side is news that @entity187 , scourge of his teams on so many occasions during the last decade , is out with an ankle injury			1
less encouraging , is confirmation that @entity184 will start despite the problem with his hamstrings			0
@entity184 has eight goals this season and @entity2 dubbed him ‘ a killer ’ in front of goal			1
‘ i ’ve never seen a player adapt as quickly , ’ he admitted , although he has @entity201 fresh from a hat - trick in @entity203			2
it will be decided on the pitch but their professional rivalry will bristle again on the touchline			0
just as it did in march , when @entity2 watched the horror of his 1,000th game unfold and @entity45 celebrated @entity14 ’s sixth goal like a vandal spray - painting his own message on the milestone			1

@entity17 were humiliated by their rivals at @entity28 last season
@entity14 went 3 - 0 up inside 17 minutes as @entity150 were put to the sword
@entity3 was mistakenly sent off for the *visitors* after his team - mate @entity5 handled on the line
@entity2 however , has *vowed* to make amends when @entity17 travel to face their rivals on sunday
