by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 is still backing @entity2 to win the @entity3 - even after losing star man @entity4 to injury and captain @entity6 to suspension ahead of their semi final clash with @entity10			1
and the @entity12 manager believes the loss of @entity15 centre back @entity6 will be more of a problem against the @entity17 than that of @entity4			1
the @entity20 captain picked up a needless yellow card for a challenge on goalkeeper @entity23 in the 2 - 1 win over @entity25 that ruled him out of the semi final after also being booked in the group stage draw with @entity28			0
' @entity2 needs him ( @entity4 ) because he 's that individual player that can win one against ones and unbalance situations for the opponent and score a goal , ' he said			1
' he 's fantastic also in the service for the set pieces			0
' but i would say that @entity6 in this moment is so more important than @entity4 in the team , ' he said			2
@entity51 to shine in @entity4 's absence - @entity6 disrupted : @entity6 and @entity53 are the regular partnership in @entity2 's defensive system key : @entity4 might be @entity2 's talisman but @entity1 says the loss of @entity6 is a bigger issue analyst : @entity12 boss @entity1 is @entity60 's @entity59 ambassador ' his absence is an important absence because @entity2 's game is based on their defensive structure where @entity6 gives great stability to the team			1
' of course they have @entity68 and @entity69 as an option to play - maybe because @entity69 plays in @entity10 and in the same team as every one of the other @entity17 players , he is the elected one but @entity6 is an important player for them			2
' but @entity1 still believes @entity2 will go on to win the tournament on home soil despite their significant absentees			2
captain , leader , legend : @entity1 says @entity6 is a big loss replacements : @entity69 or @entity68 could replace @entity6 in the heart of @entity2 's defence @entity51 ready to fill @entity4 's boots ' i think @entity2 is a fighting team			1
every player is giving absolutely everything and that is something i respect			0
' but the reality is that they do n't play quality football , they do n't use the quality of so many good players but i think they know what they are doing			0
they have it clear in their minds			0
' in the second half ( against @entity25 ) you could see perfectly @entity2 not trying to play , not trying to keep the ball , everybody defending , with a big effort from everyone			0
' i think the end of the story will see @entity2 as champions by respect of the fact that they are showing they are a team and they are giving everything to win the competition			2
they 're doing everything for their country and nobody can criticise their philosophy			0
horror : @entity4 is out of the @entity3 with a spinal injury - but @entity1 says @entity2 can still win @entity1 is an exclusive analyst for @entity60 â€™s worldwide football coverage , www.yahoo.co.uk/worldcup is the only place to read all his expert opinions during the @entity3 2014 .			1

@entity1 says @entity6 's *influence* on @entity2 's system makes him a big loss
@entity4 is out for the tournament but @entity6 could be back for the final
@entity12 boss expects @entity69 to replace @entity2 's captain
he says @entity2 's fighting style will lead them to the title
but the special one says @entity142 is n't getting the best from his players
@entity1 , though , has respect for a side ' doing everything ' to win
