it might have been cheaper to fly ... @entity0 's airfare wars have cut costs dramatically according to the results @entity0 came up trumps costing just $ 10.36 ( £ 6.28 ) on average to travel 100 kilometres on a commercial flight			2
that 's about a third of the cost of flights in the @entity38 and less than one thirteenth of the cost of flying in the most expensive country in the world , @entity8 , where it costs $ 138.90 ( £ 84 ) to fly the same distance			0
in fact , airfares in @entity0 are so low that it is often cheaper to travel by air than take the train : according to the survey , a 100 kilometre train journey in @entity0 costs $ 15.98 ( £ 9.60 ) and going by bus the same distance $ 6.17 ( £ 3.70 )			0
it might be pretty but it 's pretty expensive too ... @entity12 's average travel costs are the highest globally flight cost index shows the cheapest and most expensive flights in the world the second cheapest country for air travel was @entity1 , where the cost was an average $ 12.27 ( £ 7.42 ) to fly 100 kilometres , @entity58 was third at $ 12.48 ( £ 7.54 ) and suprisingly , @entity62 was number four costing $ 13.09 ( £ 7.90 ) over the same distance			1
