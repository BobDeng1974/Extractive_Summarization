by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 18:43 est , 22 november 2012 at 5.55pm on thursday evening , @entity1 breezed into the @entity3 suite at @entity4 and was ready for anything			1
this , after all , is @entity7			1
the @entity10 champions ’ new manager was fully - briefed			2
on @entity7 ’s chaotic regime , the hostile reception from supporters and the @entity15 affair			1
he batted away a question about the @entity19 ’s verdict that there was no substance to @entity7 ’s allegation : ‘ this is my first day and i have just arrived , ’ he said			1
‘ i went straight to training and have only thought about the team and what i want to do			2
i want to concentrate on football issues if i can			2
’ i 'm back ! @entity1 held his first press conference as @entity7 manager at @entity4 on thursday remember me ? @entity1 takes his first @entity7 training session on thursday afternoon under the microscope : @entity7 fans have been given their first glimpse of the new @entity35 boss video : watch @entity1 's first press conference as @entity7 boss @entity7 stars were forced to cancel a team - bonding session after @entity41 was fired			1
morale among players was so low following the 2 - 1 defeat at @entity45 they planned a night out on wednesday at @entity47 , a venue beneath @entity4			2
it was seen as a chance for the squad to repair relations with the backroom staff following the stormy scenes at @entity55 when players , management and coaching staff traded insults after they fell four points behind @entity61			2
@entity7 assistant manager @entity62 had arrived at @entity55 with a black eye and a cut cheek and it was still prominent when he was in the dug - out at the @entity66 on tuesday night			2
it was a nice idea , but there are too many other issues surrounding this club at the moment and not enough people in power to answer them			1
chairman @entity74 and chief executive @entity75 are happy to pipe up on radio stations when it suits them , but when it comes to questions that are fully - loaded they are nowhere to be seen			2
when the @entity19 released a statement clearing @entity15 of racially abusing their own player , @entity84 , they did n’t have the courage to face up to questions			1
when @entity1 was asked to explain why he is prepared to keep the seat warm for @entity90 , the @entity88 coach was left to front it out himself			1
when the inevitable questions about the savage decision to fire @entity41 just six months after leading them to @entity97 glory began , it was left to @entity1			1
no action : @entity15 has no case to answer while @entity84 ( right ) has been charged by the @entity19 revival bid : @entity1 gets to work on making @entity102 score goals again for the @entity35 new man : @entity1 arrives at their @entity104 before assessing his new workplace ‘ it ’s like being at a @entity97 press conference , ’ he joked , holding the @entity7 shirt up for cameramen and immediately settling into his stride			1
it was impressive stuff , but after finally meeting @entity114 for the first time over dinner on thursday night , he will soon come to terms with the conditions every @entity7 coach has to work under			2
@entity1 added : ‘ this is a massive club , one that allows me to fight for trophies			1
if you see my cv , i have all the trophies you can win at club level			1
i won the league twice , in @entity88			2
in @entity88 , @entity90 can not win the @entity128 — you can not win the @entity128 if you are a coach in @entity88			2
‘ the @entity128 , obviously , would be a massive trophy because i know how difficult it is to win it			2
if you get an opportunity like this , you have to take it			2
i do n’t care about short - term			2
i have to win every game			2
new man in the hotseat : @entity1 arrives at training at @entity7 's @entity104 training ground and told the fans to get behind him reunited : @entity102 arrives at training at @entity104 ahead of his reunion with @entity1 leader : captain @entity144 turns up for training ‘ we have five trophies to fight for			1
i will try from day one			1
in football and life you never know			2
if we win some trophies in seven months , everybody will be delighted			0
’ this is a six - month trial , a chance to prove to the rest of the world that he remains one of the best coaches in football			0
that experience , along with his ability to get the best out of @entity102 at @entity162 , is the reason he has been appointed as @entity7 ’s interim manager on a six - month contract			0
@entity1 said : ‘ i spoke with @entity102 like with the others players today , and his attitude was really good			1
it seems everybody was saying he was n’t doing well and i was saying the same when i was watching games			0
‘ but his attitude was really good and with this attitude , all the players will do well			0
it will be easier with @entity102 than the others			0
he is a top - class player and with his attitude , he will do it			0
i know how good he can be , as i know how good @entity177 or @entity178 can be			0
he ’s one of the important players in this team , and i ’ll try and improve him like i will the other players			0
’ that is one of the reasons he has been appointed , to improve the form of a man who was once recognised as one of the most feared forwards in the game			0
@entity102 has n’t scored in the @entity128 since oct 6 , when he found the net during a routine victory over promoted @entity192			0
the former @entity194 striker , who was signed by @entity1 in 2007 , will start against @entity61 in his first game on sunday			1
this is the beginning of @entity7 ’s recovery			0
it has to be that way after falling four points behind @entity61 in the @entity128 and in danger of becoming the first @entity97 winners to be dumped out in the group stages			0
making his point : a @entity7 fan stands outside the training ground with an @entity208 sign no thanks : @entity7 fan protested when @entity1 was linked in march @entity1 has made a start by appointing former @entity7 star @entity212 as first - team coach and has also brought in two of his old @entity194 backroom staff , fitness coach @entity214 and analyst @entity216			1
winning trophies is all important and they can make a start in the @entity220 next month			0
it will certainly help his relationship with the supporters , particularly after the hostile reaction to his appointment			1
at @entity194 , during those infamous @entity97 clashes with @entity227 , he claimed @entity7 ’s supporters were no match for the @entity230			0
@entity1 said : ‘ i do n’t remember the comments , but if i said it then you have to analyse the context			1
we were playing against @entity7 , a top side , in the semi-final of the @entity97 and i was defending my team			0
@entity237 : @entity212 will be one of @entity1 's coaches end of the road : @entity41 was sacked following @entity7 's defeat to @entity241 ‘ if i ’m a fan , i ’d like to see my manager fighting for my team , my club , and doing almost everything			1
so i do n’t think it ’s a lack of respect for the @entity7 fans			1
‘ i ’m sure the fans here would like to see me doing the same now that i am here , defending their club			1
we have something in common : i want to win every single game			0
’ @entity1 has worked under difficult conditions before , caught in the crossfire when @entity194 ’s previous owners @entity257 and @entity259 fell out			1
he said : ‘ when i left @entity194 i had two bosses who were not talking to each other			0
’ after accepting a six - month contract , he could n’t be more wrong			0
2005after the game , @entity265 , who was sitting right in line in the main stand , said to me that the ball had crossed the line			0
she is a very honest person and that was good enough for me			0
( on taking his secretary ’s word that @entity283 ’s so - called ‘ ghost goal ’ had crossed the line in the @entity97 semi-final between the sides ) to me , @entity274 played much better football two or three years ago			0
they won matches and were exciting to watch			0
they create excitement so how can you say @entity7 are the best in the world ? ( after @entity7 ’s first @entity128 title win ) @entity295 is a big club with fantastic players , every manager wants to coach a such a big team			1
but i would never take that job , in respect for my former team at @entity194 , no matter what			0
for me there is only one club in @entity306 , and that ’s @entity194			1
if @entity7 are naive and pure then i ’m @entity308			0
we do not need to give away flags for our fans to wave — our supporters are always there with their hearts and that is all we need			1
it ’s the passion of the fans that helps to win matches — not flags			1
( the quote has been immortalised in a plaque at @entity194 ’s training ground , below ) i ’m sure @entity7 do not like playing @entity194			0
when they are talking and talking and talking before the game it means they are worried			0
maybe they ’re afraid ? we were good friends until @entity194 started winning , then he started changing his mind			0
( on then @entity7 boss @entity227 ) yesterdayin the past i was playing against @entity7 , a top side , in the semi-finals of the @entity97 and if i am a fan i like to see my manager fight for my team , trying to win every game and doing almost everything , so i do n’t see a lack of respect for @entity7 fans , it was more a manager defending his team against another top side			1
i am sure they will like to see me defending my club now in the way i defended @entity194 at this time			1
and as for @entity102 i know everybody will be talking about @entity102 and today i was talking with him like i was talking with the other players and his attitude was good			0
everybody has been talking about he was not doing well and i was the same because i was watching games and his attitude was really poor , and today it was the same as all the others .			0
