by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 15 june 2013 since 1784 , the bells of @entity2 ’s in the sleepy village of @entity4 , @entity5 , have pealed out their mellifluous call to worship every sunday			1
but this morning the bells will be silent after bellringers decided to go on strike – because the vicar asked them to begin pealing too early in the morning			1
despite their enthusiasm for their art , they believe villagers do not want their sunday morning lie - ins disturbed at the ungodly hour of 8.45am			1
silent protest : @entity16 , lead by captain @entity18 , have gone on strike because they believe villagers do not want their sunday morning lie - ins disturbed at the ungodly hour of 8.45am @entity4 vicar @entity20 caused the stand - off when he decided to move his sunday morning service from 11.15am to 9.15am in an attempt to tempt more people to attend church			1
but the captain of the campanologists , @entity18 , said : ‘ we do n’t believe it is right to peal the bells before 9am as people have been working all week and like to enjoy a lie - in			1
‘ what is particularly galling is that the vicar made the decision without consulting the bellringers			2
clanger ? @entity37 caused the stand - off when he moved his sunday morning service from 11.15am to 9.15am to tempt more people to church ‘ we have asked the vicar to move the service just 15 minutes later so we can do our ringing without waking everyone up at the crack of dawn , but he refuses to do so			1
’ a leaflet has been posted through villagers ’ doors , telling them of the sunday stand - off			2
it says : ‘ the bells of @entity2 ’s have been calling @entity54 to worship on sundays since the 1700s			2
‘ following decision by the vicar to change the times of the sunday services , it now seems unlikely that the bells will be rung again on a sunday morning			2
the responsibility for this action lies directly with the vicar			0
the question to be asked is			0
what would @entity66 have done ? ’ mr @entity37 made the decision to move the times of the sunday service with permission from the @entity71			1
they believe moving worship to an earlier time slot will attract more parents with younger children to church as an earlier service interferes less with the day			2
it also allows the vicar to perform a second service in nearby @entity82			2
the village ’s online message board includes comments from residents unhappy at the decision			0
some have complained that since mr @entity37 took up the post 18 months ago , he has isolated more traditional members of the congregation			0
one wrote : ‘ is this how it should be for devoted @entity54 who have remained loyal to @entity2 ’s for 30 to 40 years			0
and indeed heavily contributed their time , efforts and finances ? ‘ is this vicar being led by the voice of @entity99 or by the voice of his ego ? ’ another wrote : ‘ it seems to me the whole village is going to suffer the loss of the bells , and it is a shame that one man ’s arrogance and stubbornness can bring this about			0
’ a third comments : ‘ very , very sad and quite shocked to learn the church bells of @entity4 will not ring on a sunday morning			1
i hear it ’s all to do with a more “ convenient ” time for the sunday service			1
seems to have been perfectly satisfactory until now			0
’ complaints : some parishioners of @entity2 's have complained that since mr @entity37 took up the post , he has isolated more traditional members of the congregation the bells have rung almost every sunday since 1784 and were restored in 1989 with money from the late @entity127 actor @entity126 , who used to enjoy listening to them from his nearby garden			1
mr @entity37 said : ‘ we did n’t quite know how a pre- 9.15am ring would work but assumed it was manageable as long as the residents of @entity4 did n’t mind			0
‘ apparently ringing after church just is n’t done – although we would love it – and unfortunately our bellringers do n’t want to consider a pre- 9am ring			0
‘ the bellringers have asked us to move our 9.15am service to 9.30			0
the problem is we ca n’t move it without seriously inconveniencing many of our families			0
