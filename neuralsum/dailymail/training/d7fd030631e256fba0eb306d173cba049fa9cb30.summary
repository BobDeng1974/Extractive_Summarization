by @entity0 published : 22:44 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 03:43 est , 15 may 2013 @entity1 spent £ 15,000 and four years investigating her son 's death in @entity4 eventually proving the negligence of the lorry driver who killed him a mother who refused to accept the lies of a @entity4 lorry driver who killed her son on holiday has finally seen him jailed after a four - year campaign for justice			1
@entity16 claimed @entity17 lost control of his moped and slid under the wheels of his truck in @entity22 in june 2009			1
@entity4 police believed him and said the death of 24 year - old @entity25 , who was on holiday with best friend @entity28 , was an accident			1
but @entity25 's mother @entity30 , 55 , turned detective and unravelled a web of lies that her son 's killers had woven			1
her quest for the truth began after mr @entity28 , 28 , told her how the lorry had dangerously pulled in front of them			0
@entity16 , 46 , then leapt from his cab to clear @entity25 's bike out of the way before driving off without calling for help			2
determined @entity30 , a mother - of - three , begged the @entity47 and @entity4 authorities to re-open the case but says she was simply abandoned			2
she launched her own investigation - which cost her £ 15,000 - from her kitchen in @entity51 , @entity52			1
she began with a staggering 500 phone calls and appeals in the @entity4 press to track down the doctor who helped her son at the scene			2
@entity16 had told police the medic was foreign - but @entity30 proved his first lie by discovering that she was @entity4			2
she then took the decision to re-examine her son 's dead body herself and saw that he had no scratches or injuries apart from the head injury that killed him			1
that showed that @entity25 - himself a lorry driver - had been killed in a head - on crash , and not by sliding off his moped			1
@entity73 was discredited further still when @entity30 found he had lied with local shopkeeper @entity74 to cover his tracks			0
@entity17 pictured on his moped in @entity22 in 2009 shortly before his death			2
@entity73 claimed @entity25 lost control and slid under his lorry @entity17 ( left ) pictured in @entity22 in 2009 with friend @entity28 , who told @entity25 's mother how the lorry had dangerously pulled in front of them @entity74 had told police he had no idea who had delivered ice - cream to him 15 minutes before the crash - but delivery records showed @entity73 's name			1
@entity30 , who also has one grandchild , eventually amassed a dossier detailing 24 flaws in the killer driver 's account and persuaded @entity4 prosecutors to reopened the case			1
and last month @entity73 was finally convicted of negligent homicide and fleeing the scene of the crash and jailed for 23 months in prison			1
@entity30 , a full - time carer , said her family would now be able to grieve for the first time			0
she said : ' it makes me feel sick to think that the driver got out of his van and instead of helping @entity25 just moved the bike and drove off			2
mrs @entity1 was desperate to prove that @entity73 was responsible for her son @entity25 's ( pictured ) death - and even examined his body to prove her theory ' he should have called the ambulance and police			1
but instead he removed evidence to try and protect himself			0
' i promised @entity25 that day that i would not let it get swept under the carpet			0
we never wanted compensation we just want justice for our son			0
' i was desperately trying to get someone to help me or take an interest in the case , but i kept getting the door shut in my face			0
the driving license of hit and run truck driver , @entity16 , ( left ) who was finally convicted for the death of @entity17 @entity1 ( left ) pictured with her daughter @entity131 , said her family would now be able to grieve for the first time ' every time i found something out it was like getting another piece of the jigsaw			1
' i do n't know how i did it at the beginning - i was just running on adrenaline			0
i could n't really take in what had happened			0
' every time i thought i could not go on it was like @entity25 was there spurring me on			0
' people expect you to move on after four years , but we are stuck in the day it happened as - until now - we had no resolution			0
' we have not had any time to grieve properly so now hopefully the process will start			0
' @entity30 has now asked the @entity52 coroner to change the verdict in @entity25 's inquest from a narrative verdict of a road traffic collision to unlawful killing .			0
