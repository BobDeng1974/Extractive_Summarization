romance of the @entity1 ? not for @entity2			1
while there have been countless tales in this season ’s competition to put sheen on the old pot , @entity2 have been reacquainted with old ghosts			2
first up was @entity10 , meaning a month of having to listen to countless references to that final of 1988 , when ‘ the @entity14 ’ of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 came undone against ‘ the @entity13 ’ , destroying their chances of a @entity19 the fifth round draw put on the agenda a potential reunion with @entity23 of @entity24 ; @entity23 , remember , was the man who settled the 1990 semi-final at @entity27 , his goal securing a 4 - 3 win that derailed @entity2 ’s hopes of landing the two big domestic gongs			2
@entity32 was @entity2 's matchwinner as they came from behind to beat @entity34 2 - 1 on wednesday the 22 - year - old prepares to curl a delightful effort off the underside of the bar and into the @entity34 net the @entity41 midfielder ( centre left ) points to the sky after his goal put @entity2 into the @entity1 fifth round @entity45 ( left ) jumps for joy with @entity32 as @entity2 secure a fifth round tie against @entity48 sandwiched in between , of course , was @entity34			1
back in 1993 , they inflicted one of the biggest surprises in the competition ’s history , winning 2 - 0 at @entity54 as a club from the old third division to ensure @entity2 ’s @entity1 defence got no further than the first hurdle			1
to many of the players @entity62 selected here , history should have had no bearing but @entity2 have laboured through this year ’s @entity1 as if the psychological scars have not healed			1
perhaps we should have known all along that one of the old spectres would haunt them			0
the thing is , they should have got through this test			0
@entity34 – and they deserve tremendous credit – were organised , spirited and tenacious but should they really have been able to keep a side that cost more than £ 110million to assemble so quiet for two games ? @entity62 was not in the least bit perturbed about this tie being taken to a replay , as he was adamant the slick , open playing surface at @entity79 would suit @entity2 , allow them to pass , pass and pass until @entity34 were hypnotised			1
@entity80 boss @entity62 was confident going into the match that @entity34 's pitch will help his side 's style @entity85 ( left ) pulled @entity2 level with his five minutes to go after a brilliant @entity80 move sterling wheels away in celebration of his 86th minute equaliser against @entity92 's side @entity54 ’s pitch has been a source of contention for @entity62 , who believes the surface is hindering @entity2 ’s potential , so he knew there were no excuses			1
this had to be a night for some of those ball players to come to the fore			0
for long period , however , it seemed as if his players wanted to score the perfect goal			0
@entity34 were spirited in the first 45 minutes but @entity2 over-elaborated , as if they were trying to walk the ball into the net			2
@entity110 , @entity32 , @entity85 – all were guilty of lacking the gumption to finish off the moves that took them into positions to pull the trigger			2
@entity32 and @entity85 – the two great hopes for the future – were particularly guilty			0
@entity32 was big news in the build up to this game , the new contract he signed ensures he will stay at the club until 2020 and @entity62 felt compelled to liken him to @entity123 and @entity124 , the men responsible for keeping @entity127 carousel ticking			1
@entity110 wore a pair of boots with ' 700 ' stitched into them to mark his 700th appearances for the @entity80 the midfielder though had an average performance against their championship opponents on wednesday labelled ‘ the magician ’ by @entity62 , there is no doubt he has wonderful ability but sometimes @entity32 leaves you exasperated that he does n’t light up the big games away from home and this was a contest that was heading that way			1
the goal he scored to ensure more ‘ memories ’ will be dredged up in the coming weeks was magnificent , full of lift , spin and vision that only a few would attempt and fewer still would be able to pull off			0
he came good just when @entity62 needed him			0
he needs to keep doing it .			0
