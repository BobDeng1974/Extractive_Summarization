the largest glacier in @entity1 is melting due to warm ocean water , according to @entity4 scientists			1
until recently , the 74 - mile - long ( 120km ) @entity5 was thought to be surrounded by cold waters and therefore very stable and unlikely to shrink			1
but now experts say that waters around the glacier are warmer than expected and are probably melting the ice from below			1
' we knew that the glacier was thinning from the satellite data , and we did n't know why , ’ @entity22 , the voyage 's chief scientist told @entity24			0
the expedition found that waters around the glacier , which is 18 miles ( 30km ) wide , were 1.5 ° c warmer than other areas visited on the same trip during the southern hemisphere summer			1
‘ we made it to the front of the glacier and we measured temperatures that were warm enough to drive significant melt , ’ dr @entity22 said			0
‘ and so the fact that warm water can reach this glacier is a sign that @entity1 is potentially more vulnerable to changes in the ocean driven by climate change than we used to think			1
’ the glacier , located in @entity1 ( marked on the map ) was known to be thinning thanks to satellite images , but it is only now that scientists think they know why until recently , the 74 mile long ( 120km ) glacier was thought to be surrounded by cold waters and therefore very stable and unlikely to change			1
a stock image of a penguin strolling past the @entity55 @entity54 station in @entity1 is shown previous expeditions had been unable to get close to the glacier due to heavy ice , but dr @entity22 said the weather had held for the @entity61 icebreaker and a team of scientists and technicians from the @entity65 and other bodies to investigate			2
dr @entity22 stressed that the glacier is not about to melt entirely overnight and cause a 20 ft rise in sea levels , but that research will help scientists predict how changes in ocean temperatures will impact on ice sheets			1
‘ this study is a step towards better understanding of exactly which parts of the ice sheets are vulnerable to ocean warming and that is the sort of information that we can then use to improve our predictions of future sea level rises , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity1 is not as protected from change as we use to think , ’ he said			2
the melt rate of glaciers in the fastest - melting part of @entity1 has tripled over the past decade , analysis of the past 21 years showed in a report published last month			2
the @entity91 has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the @entity93			2
last month a @entity95 study suggested the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago			0
researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in @entity102 may be irreversible			0
the @entity91 ( pictured ) has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the @entity93			0
now , a new @entity95 study suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago the findings of the 21 - year study by @entity108 and the @entity109 , @entity111 claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the @entity114			0
scientists found the rate by taking radar , laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers ' mass between 1992 and 2013			2
they found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year ( 91.5 billion @entity95 tons ) , or the equivalent of losing the water weight of @entity123 every two years			0
' the mass loss of these glaciers is increasing at an amazing rate , ' said scientist @entity127 , jointly of the @entity128 and @entity108 's @entity129			0
' previous studies had suggested that this region is starting to change very dramatically since the 1990s , and we wanted to see how all the different techniques compared , ' added lead author @entity134 of @entity128 .			0

@entity5 was thought to be surrounded by cold waters
but scientists have found surrounding waters are warmer than expected
they were 1.5 ° c warmer than other areas during the summer
study hints @entity1 is not as protected from change as experts used to think and could shed light on vulnerable parts of the ice sheets
