hard - won win : @entity8 , 48 , of @entity20 has won her harassment case against @entity23 bank after she received 550 calls over a missed loan payment miss @entity8 received 92 calls during a fortnight and eight on one day alone and became a ' nervous wreck ' with the stress caused by the ' rude and uncaring ' bank			1
she felt so angry about her treatment that she sued for harassment			0
miss @entity8 , a former bar worker with no qualifications , represented herself during a gruelling five - year legal battle			1
and she won her case against all the odds , despite being up against a team of expensive lawyers			0
her victory was only possible because she recorded 61 calls on her mobile phone and produced them as evidence			2
judge @entity43 , @entity45 , sitting at @entity46 awarded miss @entity8 £ 7,500 damages and said some of the bank staff 's remarks were ' unacceptable			1
' all on record : @entity8 recorded several phone conversations with the call centre during the months of harassment , where staff repeatedly told her they would not stop calling her he said : ' i was shocked when i read some of the utterances which were given out from the call centre			1
' miss @entity8 said : ' they were nasty , they were offensive and it was shocking			1
i did n't want to be pestered by phone calls , i wanted to deal with them in person at the bank			1
' but refusing to take no for an answer , the call centre repeatedly phoned her mobile and her parents ' home , where she used to live , from 8am until 9pm			1
' they would n't stop ringing and when i asked for a supervisor they hung up on me			0
i was absolutely devastated and paralysed , i was angry , shaking and tearful			0
i could n't eat or sleep because of the calls			2
' i would n't open my door or my blinds because i was so worried about the bank and what they might do			0
i was left a nervous wreck			0
' miss @entity8 , of @entity20 , @entity84 , was unable to work because of a stress - related health problem and living off benefits at the time the problems began in december 2007			1
she was making £ 115 monthly repayments on a £ 7,350 bank loan when her benefits were late coming into her account and she missed a repayment			0
miss @entity8 received a letter giving her a date in the following month to repay the money by and she went into her branch to sort it out before the deadline			1
long battle : despite explaining to staff at the call centre that she would rather deal with the staff at her branch , miss @entity8 would receive phone calls up to eight times a day for seven months bank worker : is that @entity8 ? miss @entity105 : i 've spoken to people like you before and i keep asking you to not ring me up and to contact me in writing if you need to contact me			1
bank worker : well it 's urgent we speak to you , that 's why we 're ringing you @entity113 : well i 've told you that i will go into my bank and see them			0
i do n't want people ringing me up over and over again and to have to keep telling them this			0
well you 've given this number as a contact @entity121 : i have n't actually			0
and another thing , right , i 'd like you to take this number off your records ... how many times a day are you going to ring me ? bank worker : well , until you speak to us and co-operate with us , we are going to continue to call you with regards to this matter			1
( later in the conversation ) miss @entity8 : how long is this going to go on ? can you take this number off your records because this is harassment and this is making me @entity134 worker : right , okay , madam but we need to contact you so we are going to call you on this @entity121 : so you 're going to carry on ringing me ? bank worker : yes , right , until you 're willing to speak to us , madam			1
miss @entity8 : ' you 're going to carry on ringing me and you will not stop ringing me ? @entity142 worker : no , we 're not going to stop ringing you , madam , no. ( two days later she speaks to another bank worker ) miss @entity8 : why am i getting these calls when i keep asking you to stop ringing me ? bank worker : that 's @entity8 , yes ? miss @entity105 : did you hear me ? bank worker : yes @entity151 @entity105 : can you hear me ? why am i getting these calls when i keep asking you to stop ringing me ? bank worker : is this @entity8 i am talking to , yes ? miss @entity105 : are you deaf ? bank worker : right , @entity8			1
we wo n't stop the calls unless we talk to @entity157 : and do you know that i keep asking over and over again for you not to ring me ? and i will contact my bank directly and speak to @entity161 worker : right miss @entity105 : over and over again i keep asking you and you keep ringing me			2
i 'm getting called at 8.10 in the morning and 9.50 at @entity163 worker : you will do.miss @entity8 : i will do ? over and over again ? bank worker : yes			1
do you want me to stop the calls coming out to you ? miss @entity105 : excuse me , how many times have i asked ? stop ringing @entity168 worker : okay			2
we 'll give you a ring @entity171 : no you won't.bank worker : yes we will			0
miss @entity105 : oh and you 're just going to keep doing it over and over again ? bank worker : yes until you talk to us			0
however , the issue was not resolved because the bank had ' blocked ' her account in error and staff at the branch refused to sort it out			2
miss @entity8 said she was keen to protect her credit history but the calls continued despite paying her arrears when the block was lifted from her account			1
' if i had not recorded the calls i would n't have had a chance of proving anything , ' she said			2
she decided to take action on a ' matter of principle ' and received £ 5,000 legal aid which paid for initial advice from a solicitor and the opinion of a barrister			0
when the case came to court she represented herself and after losing the harassment case the bank spent £ 30,000 on an appeal , which they also lost			0
helped by two friends , miss @entity8 travelled to @entity206 to face the @entity208 judges , who last month backed her rather than the highly paid bank @entity45			1
' i could n't give up , if i had given up i would have felt finished			0
they have tried to crush me from the day this started			0
it was never about the money , i wanted to be heard and to prove a point			0
' i have never received an apology from the bank and i just hope they now change the way they work			0
' miss @entity8 said she hoped now to get on with her life , but she could yet face financial ruin			2
she still owes more than £ 10,000 to the bank and although the bank must pay most of her legal costs , she has to pay its fees for three days of court hearings - likely to be between £ 10,000 and £ 30,000			0
a @entity23 spokeswoman said : ' this case dates back several years and we are confident that our policies and procedures have long since been updated , addressing the concerns raised in the judgment			2

@entity8 , 48 was harassed by @entity23 call centre staff
she requested to deal with her branch , but the calls *persisted*
she received 550 calls during a seven month period - up to eight a day
