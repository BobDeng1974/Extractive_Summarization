@entity0 wants to lead from the front as he takes over as @entity4 's @entity3 captain in the absence of the injured @entity6			1
the 25 - year - old was on monday promoted to the vice-captaincy , chosen ahead of the veteran @entity9 to lead the @entity10 out against @entity11 in the second test in @entity13 on wednesday , with @entity14 indicating the decision was made with an eye on the future as @entity6 's injury woes put his long - term status in doubt			1
@entity0 is the third youngest player in the squad to play at the @entity22 and will be @entity4 's youngest captain since @entity24 in the 1970s , but he promised not to let the added responsibilities change the way he approaches the game			1
@entity0 with lead @entity4 for the rest of their @entity3 series against @entity4 @entity0 ( right ) and @entity30 train at the @entity22 ahead of the second test against @entity11 the new @entity4 captain smiles as pace bowler @entity33 ( right ) limbers up @entity0 in the nets with @entity35 , who was 12th man during the first test ' i think first and foremost i will try to lead from the front in terms of my performances , ' he said			1
' the on - field tactics , i think we 've been pretty good this year , " pup " ( @entity6 ) has been amazing with that and what he 's got going on			2
with the group we 've got going forward i do n't really feel there 's any need for a big change there			0
' @entity0 , who made his @entity3 as a spinner aged 20 , was not even in the squad at the start of last year , but since coming back into the side he has established himself as one of the leading batsmen and his unbeaten innings of 162 and 52 in the 48 - run victory over @entity11 in the first @entity3 took his @entity3 average to 46.03			1
' it 's obviously been a pretty whirlwind 18 months for me personally , and for the team as well , ' @entity0 said			2
' for this to come up so quickly , it 's an amazing thrill			0
it 's something that i 've always dreamt of doing			0
to now have the opportunity to lead @entity4 in a test match and the rest of this series , it 's an amazing thrill			1
' @entity68 dives as he attempts to take a catch during the session in @entity13 @entity68 trieas to get his hands on the ball as it flies towards him @entity33 lifts weights on the outfield at the @entity22 as @entity4 look to go 2 - 0 up in the series @entity0 speaks to the media as he is announced as @entity4 's skipper for the series @entity0 has captaincy experience with both @entity80 and the @entity81 and is confident he can step up at @entity82 with the help of some of the senior players around him			1
' when i 'm just a player on the field i have my brain thinking as a captain all the time about the situation , ' he said			0
' sometimes i throw thoughts over to @entity94 ( @entity9 )			0
i have had the leadership experience with @entity80 and the @entity81 and have been quite successful			1
it is a different kettle of fish with @entity4 but i 'm looking forward to the challenge			2
' for now , @entity0 has only been confirmed as the @entity3 captain for the three remaining tests against @entity11 , but his appointment is a statement on the part of @entity14			1
@entity9 , 37 , has served as @entity6 's vice-captain and was the straightforward choice to step in when the 33 - year - old @entity6 suffered a fresh hamstring problem on the final day of the fifth test , having captained the side for the remainder of the final day			2
@entity6 is congratulated by @entity0 - and the @entity4 captain is unsure if he will return from injury @entity0 celebrates his century against @entity11 and pays tribute to the late @entity114 but with @entity6 himself admitting that the latest blow , when added to his ongoing back problems , leaves his future in doubt , @entity14 felt it needed to address the question of his long - term successor			1
@entity122 , @entity14 's head of team performance , said : ' this is a longer - term injury ( for @entity6 ) and the panel have been very strong in showing their hand looking for a longer - term solution			2
' the nature of @entity94 's injury - and we 'll get a better prognosis in the next 24 - 48 hours - was a pretty big factor in making this decision			0
' @entity9 , 37 , will serve as @entity0 's vice-captain			2
@entity0 said : ' i 'm extremely close to @entity9 and when i told him yesterday that ( national selector @entity137 ) called me , i think he knew what was going on			0
he 's over the moon for me , he 's proud as punch			0
' i 'm certainly going to look to @entity9 out there as @entity94 always does			0
he 's a terrific team man and he 's got a great cricket brain as well			0
he 's certainly someone i can lean on out in the middle as well			0

@entity0 , 25 , will lead @entity4 in @entity146 against @entity11
@entity6 could be forced to retire after latest injury
@entity0 has captaincy experience with @entity80 and @entity81
