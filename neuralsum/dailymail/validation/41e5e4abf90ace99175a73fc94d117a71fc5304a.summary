men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week , according to a new study observing drinking habits in @entity6			1
women drank the most , between 4 and 7 drinks per week in their 40s , but lessened their drinking after 65 , says research published in the @entity12 based on data from nine longitudinal studies in the @entity6			1
frequent drinking ( daily or most days of the week ) became more common during mid to older age , most notably among men , reaching above 50 per cent of men , said the study			1
men versus women : men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week whereas women peak in their 40s middle - aged men do n't drink as much as men in their twenties but they tend to drink more regularly even in old age			1
according to the @entity30 , @entity29 drink less than people living in the @entity6 and up to 30 per cent of the @entity29 population does nâ€™t drink at all			2
the study found that non-drinking in the @entity6 was as low as 10 per cent and that it only rose to 20 per cent in those above 90 - years - old			0
the @entity35 reports that low to moderate drinking , especially of red wine , is linked to health benefits and it 's therefore not surprising that so many men drink into old age			0
however , prior research has documented that both heavy drinkers and nondrinkers have higher risks of premature death than their peers who drink in moderation			0
some data linked to non-drinkers may be skewed because some non-drinkers may have chosen to stop drinking due to pre-existing health problems			0
drink frequency : men drink more frequently in older age than women but do n't drink as much as they did in their 20s whereas women stopped drinking at around 65 - years - old the @entity35 also mentions that alcohol is one of the most toxic substances that people consume and can often interfere with certain blood pressure medications that people take later in life			2
' it raises concerns that [ men ] are becoming dependent on alcohol and there are risks in this age group mixing alcohol with medications , ' said dr @entity75 at @entity76 , who carried out the study			0
one drink doubles someone 's chances of going to the emergency room and is an even greater risk for drunk drivers who may crash their car while under the influence			0
heavy drinking poses grave dangers to health and makes people more likely to die from suicides , homicides , liver disease , and some cancers , reports @entity94 .			1
