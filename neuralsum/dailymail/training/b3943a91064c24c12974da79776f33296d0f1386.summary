by @entity1 reporter women graduates are delaying the age they have children until 35 - almost a decade later than those who do not go to university			1
the phenomenon has grown as the number of female students has more than doubled in the past 20 years - in 2010 half of all young women in @entity11 went to university			1
now , new research suggests , a baby ’s social class can be determined by the age of their mother			1
mature mum : @entity21 presenter @entity20 , 42 , who gave birth to her first child @entity23 last november delaying motherhood by a decade helps secure these women ’s position on the career and housing ladders , but it may be at some personal cost			2
@entity31 , professor of statistics at @entity33 , part of @entity35 , said : ‘ women who have children later in life may well have established their careers , but they also face the risk of becoming the sandwich generation - looking after ageing parents or other relatives while also bringing up children			1
’ @entity45 , the professor of human geography at @entity47 whose research identified the trend , said : ‘ until the massive expansion in university education , you could n’t guess social class by the age of a child ’s mother			1
‘ birth age was similar at all levels of society			1
now the word ‘ generation ’ does n’t mean the same thing across society any more			2
‘ society has split into two groups			1
one group , of women graduates , clustered particularly in @entity67 and the commuter belt , is having children very late and the rest are having them at much the same age as their mothers and their grandmothers did			1
’ younger mum : @entity75 , 23 , with her husband @entity76 and five - month - old son @entity77 , is more typical of the social split of women who did n't attend university if the phenomenon continues for another generation , it means some grandparents will have to wait an extra 20 years , until the age of 70 , to have their first grandchild			1
prof @entity45 pointed out that although life spans are increasing , this is not happening quickly enough to make up for the gap			1
women who delay childbirth are also at higher risk of birth abnormalities , are more reliant on ivf and can not draw on the same energy levels as younger mothers			2
last year , the average age at which married women had their first child rose to 30.6 , according to the @entity102 ( @entity102 )			2
the average age for all births outside marriage was 27.1 , and 31.8 for all those within marriage			2
the @entity102 figures , however , fail to pick up the sharp divide between graduate and non-graduate mothers , because birth registers do not question a mother on her education			0
@entity115 , reader in demography at @entity117 , has just published a paper showing that half of women born in 1958 who obtained no educational qualifications had a child by the age of 22 , while for those with degrees the age was 32			2
prof @entity45 has mapped the impact with more women graduates by looking at the number of babies born to mothers aged 35 or older across @entity133 parliamentary constituencies , and comparing them with the number of university graduates identified in 2001 census data			1
six @entity67 constituencies each had more than 150,000 births to mothers aged 35 or over , over an eight - year period , while a further seven in commuting range had more than 125,000			0
they also had some of the highest concentrations of university graduates			0
by contrast , @entity146 had only 5,550 births in the same period to mothers aged 35 or over , while @entity150 had 6,500			0
there are low numbers of graduates in these areas			0
prof @entity45 , whose findings will be published by @entity156 next month in the population of the @entity158 : a different view of life in the @entity158 , said : ‘ once you have a cluster of women doing this it becomes normal and these trends become self - reinforcing			1
‘ you would be seen as very strange as a young graduate woman working in @entity67 if you had a baby at 25			0
‘ attitudes to women in high - paid work have changed , and many families need two salaries to pay for a @entity67 mortgage			0
before the house price boom you would n’t need that			0
’ one graduate woman who has delayed childbirth is @entity179 , 37 , who has three degrees			0
she had her first child at 33 and her second last year			0
mrs @entity179 , head of student recruitment at @entity67 ’s @entity184 said : ‘ i had no intention of becoming a stay - at - home mother when i had a child			0
’ however , she admitted that she will have to wait three years before she can make full use of her academic background			0

the number of female students has more than doubled in 20 years
women who do n't go to university are having children at much the same age as their mothers and grandmothers did
@entity47 professor @entity45 , who *compiled* the research , said : ' society has split into two groups '
if phenomenon continues , grandparents may not have their first grandchildren until the age of 70
