by @entity0 @entity1 has made it clear that she meant it when she announced that she will no longer live in hiding as she walked the red carpet at a @entity6 gala thursday night			1

the benefit , held at @entity42 , raised funds for one of the city 's oldest non-profit spaces founded and used by artistic communities			0
' people were surprised to see her there ... there were a lot of double takes , ' an attendee told the @entity53			0
though @entity1 alluded to boyfriends during her years hiding from the spotlight , @entity15 is not one of them as he is married to children 's book publisher @entity59 and they have two children			1
connections : friend , who is married to a children 's book publisher , was the one to convince @entity1 to write a tell - all essay for @entity11 earlier this month thursday 's event was slated as an evening to honor sculptor @entity67 , and @entity1 reportedly wanted to attend because she is a fan of @entity67 's work			1
' she saw some of my stuff when she was a teenager			0
i think she ’s a courageous woman			0
she ’s very smart , very cool to talk to , ' @entity67 told the paper , explaining that it was the first time he had met @entity1			2
' people were surprised to see her there ... there were a lot of double takes ' - an unidentified attendee ' i told her i read that thing she wrote recently , i told her , " i think you ’re a pretty courageous woman			2
" ’ @entity67 was not the only artist that @entity1 chatted with over the course of the evening			2
the @entity53 also reported that she spent time talking with artist @entity84 and actor @entity85 who were the two co-hosts of the event			0
in the @entity11 essay , @entity1 wrote about how she has spent much of the past decade hidden because she fears that any move she makes will be played into @entity90 and @entity92 's political narrative - one which shows no signs of slowing down since she is the presumptive @entity95 presidential nominee in 2016			1
moving on : @entity1 has purposefully kept a private life in the wake of the scandal but now feels she can be an advocate for those who have the internet partially to blame for their problems ( pictured in october 2012 ) that embrace : @entity1 maintains that she had a consensual relationship with then - president @entity8 but felt used later by prosecutors and investigators ' when i hear of @entity92 's prospective candidacy , i can not help but fear the next wave of paparazzi , the next wave of " where is she now ? " stories , the next reference to me in @entity114 's coverage of the primaries			1
i 've begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life , to some degree , on the political calendar , ' she wrote			0
it comes as little surprise that her first public appearance was at a charity event , since @entity1 stated in the @entity11 piece that she hopes to use her name to help those who have been the victims of online bullying			1
' thanks to the @entity131 , i was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the @entity134			0
' she views the @entity11 piece as a sign that she is ready to stop ' tiptoeing around my past - and other people 's futures			2
i am determined to have a different ending to my story			0
' ' i 've decided , finally , to stick my head above the parapet so that i can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past			0
( what this will cost me , i will soon find out			0
