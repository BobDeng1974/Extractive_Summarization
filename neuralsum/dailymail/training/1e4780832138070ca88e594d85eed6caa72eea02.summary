by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 22:33 est , 17 april 2013 given that she has just marked 60 years on the throne and attended countless ceremonial occasions , it is probably something of an occupational hazard			0
but the @entity7 , who celebrates her 87th birthday on sunday , displayed impressive reflexes as she narrowly escaped a collision with a ceremonial sword today			1
the monarch , accompanied by the @entity13 , had just arrived at @entity14 to make an historic appearance at @entity17 ’s funeral			1
after proffering a formal greeting , merchant banker mr @entity20 turned smartly on his heel to lead the royal couple up towards the @entity45 where the archbishop of @entity47 was waiting			1
but as he swung round , the large black steel sword swung wildly towards the sovereign , just missing her face			1
the @entity7 can clearly be seen recoiling backwards before turning towards her laughing husband and making what appeared to be a jokey remark about her near miss. fortunately mr @entity20 , 57 , a father - of - six from @entity54 , was blissfully unaware of the incident and continued with the rest of his duties unabashed			1
the lord mayor is elected on an annual basis and is an unpaid , non-political position			0
the role is , nowadays , primarily to act as an ambassador for all @entity65 - based financial and professional services in the @entity66			0
one is amused : luckily the @entity7 and prince @entity13 both saw the funny side of the incident no harm done : the @entity7 and prince @entity13 were greeted on the steps of the cathedral by the lord mayor of london and were to follow him inside when the incident happened , but the @entity7 appeared unfazed and smiled with her husband about the near miss in the seconds that followed the @entity77 and her husband made their way into @entity14 's to take their seats after being greeted by the lord mayor of london a spokesman for mr @entity20 declined to comment			1
the @entity7 ’s appearance at her eighth and longest - serving prime minister ’s funeral yesterday was unprecedented and taken to be a mark of respect for a woman with whom she did not always see eye to eye			2
as a rule , the @entity7 rarely attends funerals for anyone outside her immediate family			2
while she did choose to attend @entity40 ’s public commemoration in 1965 , it was an official state event for a man who had stood shoulder to shoulder with her own beloved father , @entity97 , during the @entity98			0
although @entity99 had been consulted about the plans for yesterday ’s event as far back as 2008 , the decision for her to attend was not made until the day after @entity17 ’s death when @entity99 was informed that the government intended for it to become a state occasion in all but name			0
safe distance : the @entity7 is pictured a little further away from the ceremonial sword with her head bowed during the service friendly : the @entity7 shakes hands warmly with mr @entity20 at the end of the ceremony forgetting the earlier mishap for the @entity7 and her aides , it now was n’t just an issue of whether she should attend such a ‘ unique ’ occasion , but how it would look to the public if she did n’t - particularly given talk of their occasionally less than easy relationship			1
as usual , the @entity7 conducted herself faultlessly and while she chose not to arrive before @entity17 ’s family as a mark of respect as she did for @entity40 - protocol normally dictates the @entity7 is the last to arrive and the first to leave - she did choose to show her esteem in a different way			2
there was a small , almost imperceptible , nod as her former prime minister ’s coffin passed following the service			0
then the monarch quietly , and without fanfare , waited for the @entity17 ’s immediate family to make their way down the cathedral steps and watch in quiet contemplation as the coffin was re-loaded onto the waiting hearse			0
royal sympathies : the @entity7 also spoke with @entity17 's family including her children sir @entity146 and @entity148 after the ceremony only then did she follow them , stopping for a minute on the steps to chat and proffer her condolences with a warm and friendly smile			1
she clearly greeted each member of the family group - son , sir @entity146 , and daughter @entity156 , who were accompanied by their respective partners , as well as her grand - children @entity160 and @entity161 - personally			2
@entity161 , who less than an hour earlier had set the scene for the event with a reading that showed a dignity beyond her years , offered a particularly elegant curtsy			0
no other member of the @entity168 was present for the simple reason that there was no requirement for them to do so ( which for @entity173 , who is currently holidaying in @entity54 , was no doubt something of a blessed relief as he disagreed inherently with much she had to say )			0
indeed the only other guest with strong royal links was - somewhat incongruously - @entity178 , @entity179 , whose ex-husband , prince @entity180 , served in the @entity181 .			2

*alderman* @entity20 greeted the @entity7 and prince @entity13 at @entity14 's
as he turned to lead them inside , his sword swung close to her *majesty*
unfazed , the @entity7 smiled with her husband following the mishap
