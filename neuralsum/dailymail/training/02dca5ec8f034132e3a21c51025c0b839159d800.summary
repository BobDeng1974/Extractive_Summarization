@entity0 , 22 , was in @entity1 on the trip of a lifetime			1
she was mid-way through a journalism degree , and had worked hard as a retail assistant for two years to save enough money to head off on a grand adventure with girlfriends			2
@entity0 was enjoying the high life of a tourist - exercising , jumping off cliffs , riding bikes , drinking alcohol and eating anything she wanted			1
she travelled through @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			0
seven weeks into her trip , she started noticing that her body was acting differently			1
she took a pregnancy test , and she was shocked to discover it was positive			0
i was still getting regular periods			0
i was n’t nauseous , no morning sickness , little weight gain , so it seemed silly to think i would be pregnant , ' @entity0 said travelling alone and in @entity19 , @entity0 immediately called her boyfriend of 18 months , @entity35 , in a fluster			1
' i immediately rang and told @entity35 , and although he was shocked , he was supportive and said that we could work around it , and if not , that we 'd have months to prepare for having a baby , ' @entity0 told @entity40			1
he calmed her down and told her to head to a doctor to double check			1
while she was reasonably anxious , @entity0 comforted herself with the thought that if by some small chance she was pregnant , she could n't be more than a month or two along			1
' i had absolutely no real clear symptoms			2
i was still getting regular periods			0
i was n’t nauseous , no morning sickness , little weight gain , so it seemed silly to think i would be pregnant , ' @entity0 told @entity49			1
the doctor had some different news to share with her			1
not only was @entity0 definitely pregnant , but she was 33 weeks pregnant and well into her third trimester			1
' i totally freaked out			0
i thought she said 13 weeks – not 33 ! ' @entity0 said			1
' i rang mum and she was so shocked			0
we could get over the fact that i was pregnant , but the fact i was told that i was 33 weeks was so hard to comprehend			1
' ' no way was i ready to have a baby			2
no job , and no money			0
and no time to prepare			0
' ' it was so hard being away from @entity35 and we really struggled being away from each other			0
' by this time , she was in @entity18			0
dealing with doctors in a foreign country all alone , she knew she had to get home			0
this was easier said than done , as airlines require a certificate of permission for women travelling when they are in their third trimester			0
the obstetrician she visited in @entity18 said that she would have to give birth to the baby in @entity1			1
however @entity0 , a size 6 even at 33 weeks and showing no sign of a baby bump , decided to risk it and fly home the very next day			1
' the baby was coming and coming fast , so i just had to prepare and get back home , ' @entity0 said			1
' when i called my mum , she said that 's it , we 're getting you home			0
' it was on that flight home that @entity0 felt the baby kick inside her for the first time , and realised that the situation she was in was very real			1
the proud father : @entity0 's partner @entity35 with their newborn son @entity100 @entity100 was born at 6.5 pounds after a four hour labour , which @entity0 said was easier than she 'd anticipated @entity100 lying on the stomach of his dad @entity35 , a carpenter from @entity105 when @entity0 arrived back in @entity107 , her mum took her for a further examination to find out details she was n't given overseas			1
it was at this appointment that @entity0 was given even more shocking news			1
she was n't 33 weeks pregnant , but 38 weeks , almost full term			1
' i was scared because i did n’t know if the baby was healthy , ' @entity0 said			1
' i was also scared about the future			0
being a mum is daunting			0
i had no money since i had just came back from overseas			2
where will we live , how will we pay for stuff ? i did n’t know all too much about babies			0
' @entity0 was told by the doctor that she had a tilted - back uterus , which explained why she did n't look like she was pregnant			1
she was still shocked that she had experienced no symptoms , and could n't understand how it had happened to her			2
' any belly i had i thought was just a food baby from all the eating i ’d done in @entity1 over two months			1
' ' i had thought about kids , and @entity35 and i had spoken about it , but we we ’re thinking it would be in a few years time … another 3 - 5 years time			0
' @entity0 said she and @entity35 were reluctant to tell people about being pregnant , scared that they would be criticised for not picking up on the pregnancy sooner			1
' i had thought about kids , and @entity35 and i had spoken about it , but we we ’re thinking it would be in a few years time … another 3 - 5 years time , ' @entity0 said ' when he came out it was surreal , and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says			2
it 's then that you realise that you 've made this beautiful human being , ' @entity0 said however , @entity0 said that people were overwhelmingly supportive and excited , though everyone was shocked			2
' i was scared to post on social media about him because i did n’t want to be judged , ' she said			0
' in the back of my mind i was scared of how people were going to react			0
i thought they 'd be like , oh @entity0 , you were in @entity1 two seconds ago			1
' @entity0 said she was concerned people might think that she was trying to hide that she was pregnant			1
' it was overwhelming trying to explain it to people , and i still have n't told the full story to everyone because it 's such a long process			0
' people just could n't believe it , it 's a pretty interesting story			0
' @entity0 's friends and family all pitched in and helped her and @entity35 buy all the essentials , making sure they had all the material necessities to look after their baby - who they found out during a scan was a boy			1
' that 's when we started getting excited , ' she said			0
there was still one more surprise in store for @entity0			2
when she had further testing the doctors gave her the news that she was n't 38 weeks pregnant - @entity0 's baby was actually overdue and had to be induced immediately			1
@entity179 arrived after a relatively straightforward birth , weighing 6.5 pounds , which @entity0 said was easier than she had been expecting			1
' he slipped out in the end , ' she laughed			0
' when he came out it was surreal , and that skin on skin contact is exactly like everyone says			0
it 's then that you realise that you 've made this beautiful human being			0
' ' @entity100 ’s here and i ’m going to try to be the best parent i can be for him , ' @entity0 said ' it 's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect			1
we 're definitely happy and would n't change it for the world , knowing what we do now , ' @entity0 said ' @entity35 and i looked at each other , we were amazed			2
even after two weeks we were still quite shocked and getting used to the fact were parents			0
' the 22 - year - old went from being an independent young woman travelling the globe , to a first - time mum in only a week and a half , which she still finds hard to process			0
' i 'm so very lucky to have the support of my friends and family			0
it 's been a huge adjustment to realise that i have a child , but @entity100 is such a good and calm baby			1
' @entity0 and her partner @entity35 are now living with @entity0 's parents and have started thinking about what the future will hold for their family			2
' thinking about the future is scary , ' said @entity0			2
' i need to figure out what 's best			0
should i work or go to back to university ? we want to move out and need to be thinking about money			0
' @entity0 said that she is now having to consider things she never anticipated having to think about , even six months ago			2
' at 22 you would n't think you ’d be going off to buy a house , or thinking about what school districts are the best , ' ' we 've had to start thinking about what to expect in years to come instead of thinking in the short term			0
' the young mum said that she is learning to just roll with her new role and to make the most of her life with @entity100			2
' i have a beautiful healthy baby boy , my relationship with @entity35 is stronger than ever , although it ’s more work than it ’s ever been , trying to find ‘ us time ’ , so i ca n’t complain too much , ' @entity0 told @entity49			1
@entity100 is growing well , and is now rolling on his stomach and loves giggling , said @entity0			1
' i ’ve just got ta ’ roll with it and make the most of it			0
' it 's been a long , but surprisingly quick journey to motherhood for @entity0 , who said that people are still shocked when she tells them the story			2
' even now when i tell people they are like ‘ how ? ' for now , @entity0 said she is loving being a mother to her ' little miracle ' @entity100 , and while she is still coming to terms with her new life , she is determined to be there for him no matter what			1
' @entity100 ’s here and i ’m going to try to be the best parent i can be for him			2
' @entity0 said that she is so happy with the way her life has turned out , even though it was unexpected			2
' it 's an amazing feeling knowing that you can create someone so perfect			0
we 're definitely happy and would n't change it for the world , knowing what we do now			0
