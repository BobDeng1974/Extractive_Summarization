surfacing on @entity10 website @entity8 , the images reveal an exterior virtual identical to the current @entity11 , which was only released in september			1

leaked photo ? this image purports to show the case of the new @entity3			0
published by @entity10 website @entity26 , the differences in internal attachment points suggest an update to the latest @entity4 phone @entity30 hedge its bets , admitting that while it could be a case from a new @entity11 prototype , it could equally be part of a well - made @entity36 @entity11 clone			1
it says it first found the images published on the website forum @entity39 and makes no attempt to confirm their authenticity			1
nevertheless , the apparent leak comes as the rumours have begun to circulate online that @entity4 is already about to begin making the successor to its latest smartphone			1
a @entity36 site in november claimed the firm was set to begin trial production of the new model this month , although has no details of what new features it may contain			0

' facing low yield rates in the production of @entity11 , @entity4 has accelerated the certification processes for related parts and components for the @entity3 , the paper revealed , according to @entity67			1
' while the speculated @entity3 is expected to enter volume production in the first quarter of 2013 , @entity4 is also likely to release a new version of @entity72 a quarter later than the @entity3 , since the display resolution of its latest version of @entity72 has come out lower than expected , ' the paper said			1
@entity4 's @entity11 , which went on sale on september 29th			2
however , reports today claim a new version could begin production within a month and go on sale next year			0
however , while the firm may begin trial production , some believe it may not go on sale until later next year			0
' the industry was surprised at how quickly the @entity72 4 replaced the 3 , however that was to make all of its top line products have the same connector , ' said @entity88 , editor of @entity89			0
' trial production might see we see snippets on the web , but its usually 6 - 7 months until we see a launch , and so i would expect to see a new version , be it an @entity3 or a 6 , late next year			2
' customers queue outside the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , as the new @entity11 goes on sale			0
now rumours say a new version go begin trial production within weeks			0

@entity4 has dominated the chart for more than two years , research firm @entity110 said			0
it claims @entity107 sold 18 million @entity106 models in the third quarter , compared with @entity115 sales of 16.2 million			0
strong sales of the flagship @entity106 - which comes with a large 4.8 inch touchscreen - helped @entity107 post a record $ 7.3 billion operating profit in the july - september quarter			0
@entity4 customers were also believed to be waiting for the release of the @entity11 , which is expected to propel @entity4 back to the top spot .			2
