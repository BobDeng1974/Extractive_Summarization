the ring , which includes images of a bear 's head and paws , is made of high quality bronze and was initially thought to have been made for a woman or girl			1
archeologist @entity52 , from the @entity53 of the @entity10 in @entity9 , said : ' bronze items for this period , and this area of @entity57 , are sparse and each bronze thing is a significant addition to our database			1
' other small and precious objects were also found at @entity40 - a site described as an ancient sanctuary of spiritual importance - including a small carved figure ( left ) and a pendant depicting an animal biting a bird ( right ) pictured is an interesting container with a carved bird inside found at the site , which archaeologists believe dates from around the last century @entity76 the newly - found ring ' is tiny in diameter so even a young girl , let alone a woman , can not wear it			0

' the head and front paws a bear was adorned with a handkerchief , rings , and for a few days was lying in the house			2
' this combination of the images on the ring and the fact that it was found in the sanctuary of @entity138 led us to believe that a bear cult was also practiced here			0
