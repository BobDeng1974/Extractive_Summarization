pleasure in @entity1 is vice in @entity3			1
the other week i made a documentary for @entity1 tv about @entity7 and @entity8 , for a series entitled @entity10			1
we are also covering @entity12 and @entity13			0
had it been @entity3 , these programmes would have concerned adultery and immorality			2
this being a @entity21 audience , the subject was a great love affair , a grand passion			0
@entity24 : @entity25 went to @entity1 to indulge his ' pleasure - hungry nature ' here , moral prejudices are aired , tongues wag and , as @entity29 points out in this fine historical romp , in 19th - century dictionaries , ‘ @entity1 ’ was a synonym for ‘ devil ’ and ‘ cad ’			1
@entity36 , for example , was a famous actress in @entity1 — in @entity38 she was branded ‘ a woman of notorious , shameless character ’			1
queen @entity41 set the tone			2
she loathed the ‘ luxuriousness , extravagance and frivolity ’ of the @entity1 , so it is no wonder that @entity25 , @entity25 , was tempted by life on the other side of the @entity47			1
the regulations of his mother ’s court , where the sole amusement was shooting at @entity56 and listening to bagpipes , bordered on lunacy			0
if you fancied a cigar , you had to surreptitiously lie in the fireplace and blow the smoke up the chimney			0
and any idea of sex before ( or outside of ) marriage was an abomination			0
as @entity41 put it , ‘ the sacred mysteries of creation ’ could only be countenanced if they remained ‘ shrouded in holy awe ’			1
@entity25 fled to @entity73 for ‘ boisterous fun ’ at the earliest opportunity			1
dressed in @entity77 costume — including a sporran , described in the @entity1 press as a ‘ hairy bag ’ — he attended trade exhibitions by day , examining telegraph machines , saxophones , electric clocks and modern gadgets that ‘ sliced , crushed , harvested , heated , cooled or transported any industrial or agricultural products you could think of ’			1
by night he enjoyed assignations with ladies of ‘ natural poise and delicate beauty ’ in the tree - lined alleys of the @entity93 or in hotel suites — legs - in - the - air parties in ‘ sumptuous private rooms with plush red sofas and walls swathed in velvet ’			2
where @entity38 life was puritanical and hypocritical , in @entity73 ‘ there were flowers and plants everywhere , in vases along the walls and hanging from the ceilings like coloured chandeliers ’			1
@entity25 was to decorate his own homes , @entity111 and @entity112 , in @entity1 style , with @entity115 tapestries and ‘ plenty of gilding on the woodwork ’			1
@entity73 appealed ‘ to @entity24 ’s pleasure - hungry nature ’ , but @entity41 was predictably outraged @entity73 appealed ‘ to @entity24 ’s pleasure - hungry nature ’ , but @entity41 was predictably outraged			1
in @entity1 , after all , men lolled on sofas with their hands in their pockets			2
her solution was to get the @entity25 married off — to @entity124 , daughter of the @entity126 , who is described ungallantly			2
‘ her nose was too long and her forehead too low			0
’ the poor woman also had ‘ the smallest head ever seen ’ and to cap it all was stone deaf			2
in addition to these defects , she was obliged to turn a blind eye to her new husband ’s myriad infidelities			0
fortunately , @entity124 ‘ seemed to have what it took to survive the humiliation ’ — and her stoicism was even needed during the wedding , which was gloomier than a funeral			2
exiled : @entity145 - one of @entity25 's mistresses - was sent to a ' love nest ' in @entity148 @entity41 decreed that marriage was ‘ a solemn holy act not to be classed with amusements ’			1
in the official portraits , @entity25 wears a cloak , ‘ the bulbously tasselled cord ’ of which ‘ hangs down over his crotch like an historic fertility symbol ’			1
though no oil painting — he was ‘ very bald and chubby - faced ’ — @entity25 carried on womanising until obesity and bronchitis took their toll			1
we are told that the better to enjoy his ‘ constant one - night stands and quickies , ’ he invented an ingenious love - seat , a sort of saddle or bob - sleigh , with gynaecological stirrups attached			2
less saucily — and ever fashion - conscious — he also introduced turn - ups on trousers to polite society , designed the first tuxedo and undid his lowest waistcoat button to accommodate a tummy that had swollen after many a 12 - course dinner			0
to this day , a way of spotting a gentleman is to see if he has left his lowest waistcoat button undone , in homage to @entity185 - ups remain commonplace			0
my bet is that the love - seat has been inherited by his great - great - great - great - grandson prince @entity189			0
in @entity1 , @entity25 liked watching girls swirling on a carousel , with their ‘ flying skirts and exposed calves ’			1
not only that , but because prostitution was legal in the @entity197 , the tarts were ‘ under medical surveillance , ’ and regularly checked for venereal diseases			0
@entity25 explored the bordellos of @entity201 and , having seen ‘ the shadier world of street singers ’ , was inspired to chair a @entity205 on the housing of the working class			1
@entity145 : manners , masks and morals by @entity211 ( @entity212 , ebook £ 5.99 ) a racy biography of @entity145 , who rose form provincial origins to become @entity25 's mistress			0
includes her letters to @entity218 , her childhood friend and secret lover			0
‘ @entity73 poverty made him acutely conscious of the similar conditions that existed back home			1
’ environmental health aside , however , back home carefree sex was compromised by rubber condoms ‘ as thick as kitchen gloves ’			0
@entity25 seemed to do without precautions and did n’t quite get away with each and every dalliance in @entity3			1
when he gave his lover @entity230 , @entity231 a pair of white carriage ponies as a token of his esteem , sir @entity229 had the groom bring them to him and shot them dead on the front lawn			0
living for the good times : @entity24 died in 1910 , his health ravaged by high living another mistress , @entity243 , was packed off to @entity244			0
@entity145 was exiled to ‘ a love nest in @entity148 ’ — which was n’t exactly @entity247			0
as he got older , @entity25 ventured forth to @entity1 for its health resorts rather than the brothels and salons			1
@entity247 was a favourite spot , as was the @entity252			0
‘ his less discreet mistresses complained that he stank of stale tobacco			0
’ he died in 1910 , his health ravaged by high living			0
@entity124 sportingly allowed ‘ big - busted ’ @entity256 , one of his many beloveds ( and @entity260 ’s great - grandmother ) , to be present at the deathbed			2
@entity29 maintains that @entity262 , @entity25 ’s nephew , was so incensed at having to enter @entity263 by a side - door for the lying - in - state that four years later the @entity265 broke out .			2

@entity25 , son of @entity269 @entity41 , went to @entity1 for some ' boisterous fun '
in 19th - century dictionaries , ‘ @entity1 ’ was a synonym for ‘ devil ’ and ‘ cad ’
@entity25 made sure to *satisfy* his *appetite* for pleasure in @entity73
when he returned to @entity3 and married he was constantly *unfaithful*
