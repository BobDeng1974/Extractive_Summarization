by @entity0 published : 08:51 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 08:51 est , 15 november 2012 a judge has decided against forcing a mentally impaired @entity3 woman to have an abortion after the court and her family reached a tentative agreement to help her through her high - risk pregnancy			1
the 32 - year - old woman 's legal guardian told local station @entity11 on wednesday that district court judge @entity12 had agreed that the woman wants to carry the pregnancy to term and that the evidence does n't show it 's medically necessary to abort the baby			1
the woman , who has the mental capacity of a 6 - year - old , had wandered from a @entity21 group home that she was living in and became pregnant 13 weeks ago			1
big issue : the parents of a pregnant woman with a mental age of six and the @entity3 court have agreed to help the woman carry her child to term even though it may put her health at risk the child 's father has not been identified , and it 's unknown whether the pregnancy resulted from rape or consensual sex , according to court documents			1
the @entity0 is not naming the woman or her parental guardians because the circumstances of conception remain unclear			0
the woman â€™s parents , who hail from @entity45 , @entity3 , adopted the woman and several siblings from @entity48 in 1992 , and they were appointed as her legal guardians when she turned 18			1
she suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome and epilepsy			0
after taking the abortion option off the table , @entity12 said he plans to hold additional medical evidentiary hearings in the weeks ahead to determine the safest way to proceed			0
ruling : judge @entity12 ( left ) ruled that an abortion was n't legally necessary , much to the delight of pro-life advocates like @entity59 ( right ) who got involved in the case the court became involved in late september , when officials with @entity63 voiced concerns about the effects that her medication could have on the fetus			0
the case quickly drew attention from anti-abortion advocates nationally			0
the woman 's parents said that while the pregnancy poses health risks to their daughter and the baby , medical experts back their decision to continue the pregnancy			2
@entity59 , president of @entity80 , praised the judge 's announcement that abortion no longer was an alternative			0
' we are pleased ( the pregnant woman ) will be able to carry her baby to term and that the court recognized that childbirth is a natural process and is the generally accepted course of treatment for pregnancy , ' she said in a statement			2
deadline set : legal hurdles in the case meant that it was brought to the state 's supreme court but eventually the verdict was handed down a district court judge last week , the @entity104 denied a request to block @entity12 's hearings into the health risks of the woman 's pregnancy			2
the woman 's parents argued that the judge lacked the authority to terminate the pregnancy of their daughter			2
they claimed they have exclusive authority over her health care decisions , and they want their daughter to carry the baby to term in line with their @entity120 religious beliefs			1
the state @entity104 disagreed , but the tentative agreement apparently makes the point moot .			0
