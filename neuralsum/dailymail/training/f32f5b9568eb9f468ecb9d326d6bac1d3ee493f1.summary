by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 18:40 est , 23 december 2012 updated : 04:15 est , 24 december 2012 @entity1 is facing a @entity3 revolt over plans to impose tolls on @entity7 's roads			1
senior ministers regard the plans - which the chancellor wants included in a coalition relaunch document in january - as ' a new pasty tax ' that will undermine @entity14 chances of winning the next election			1
ministers and officials have privately voiced concerns that the proposals can not be made to work and would lead to ' electoral suicide '			1
the chancellor 's plans could put him at odds with the prime minister the @entity14 spent years denouncing @entity26 for waging a ' war on motorists ' but mr @entity1 believes getting foreign investors to build new roads and pay for them with tolls will kickstart growth			1
but his calls for road tolls to be included in january 's midterm review are causing widespread irritation among his ministerial colleagues			0
transport secretary @entity38 has concerns about selling a road tax plan to the public			2
allies say he sees the advantages of putting investment on a firm footing but one added : ' he can see the political challenges			0
' senior ministers like @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 are understood to be concerned that a road toll scheme would upset @entity7			1
one ministerial aide told the @entity53 : ' this is nuts			0
' we slagged off @entity26 for years for taxing motorists off the roads and now we seem to want to do the same			0
' this just does n't make sense			0
the problem with the pasty tax and the caravan tax and all that was that the @entity63 put revenue - raising before common sense politics			2
we should n't go there again			0
' the plans could put the chancellor at odds with prime minister @entity70 , who is concerned that slapping tolls on motorways would drive traffic onto minor roads in the countryside			1
a second senior government source said : ' @entity70 only wants it if there are no losers and it 's hard to see how you can get to that point			2
people are concerned about it across the board - ministers , @entity63 officials , the lot			2
' plans to put tolls on certain lanes - branded @entity90 lanes because they would create a two - tier system have already been dismissed as reinforcing the notion that the @entity14 treat wealthy voters differently from those struggling to make ends meet			1
others are concerned that a charging scheme dependent on every driver having every trip they every make recorded on cctv cameras would lead to claims of a surveillance state			0
' i can imagine the fuss people would make about snoopers , ' said one source			0
a @entity108 official said that while the junior coalition partner was not opposed to the plans there is scepticism that a solution can be found			1
the coalition @entity114 is expected to include an intention to examine road pricing but no concrete proposal .			0

senior ministers say tax will spell ' electoral suicide ' for @entity14
proposal could create *tension* between @entity1 and prime minister
@entity108 *remain* sceptical over the plans
