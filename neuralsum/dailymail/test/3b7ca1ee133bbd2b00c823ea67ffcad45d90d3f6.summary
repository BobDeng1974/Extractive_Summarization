a @entity1 bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph ( 589km/h )			1
the maglev train completed a test run on a track in @entity8 , beating the previous record of @entity10 ( 580km/h ) set in 2003			1
another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow , and engineers at the @entity13 predict it could reach 373mph ( 600km/h )			1
this eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction , providing a faster and quieter service			2
acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains			0
and maglev also makes for much smoother journeys			2
right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres ( 250 miles ) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds			0
but vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future			0
the seven - car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway			1
the technology promises a ride that 's smoother , quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high - speed rail			1
the speeds , however , wo n't be as high when the new line between @entity49 and @entity50 comes into service in 2027			1
according to engineers , the trains will travel at 314mph ( 505km/h ) , which will cut the journey time for a 178 - mile journey by more than half			1
for comparison , the @entity59 's @entity58 rail line will run at 224mph ( 360km/h )			2
the maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time			0
@entity1 is well - established as the world leader in high - speed trains , having developed the first ' bullet train ' in 1964 it is now hoping to bring the technology to the @entity70 and has outlined plans for a line between @entity73 and @entity74 , which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes			1
@entity77 was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century			0
the first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low - speed shuttle at @entity83 in 1984			1
this travelled at a rather mundane 26mph ( 42km/hr )			0
it was not until the turn of the century , though , that high - speed maglev would come into commercial operation , mostly in @entity1 and @entity89			1
the technology promises a ride that 's smoother , quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high - speed rail			1
the speeds wo n't be as high when the new line between @entity49 and @entity50 comes into service in 2027 @entity89 was the first country to have a commercially - operated @entity97 service			1
the @entity98 opened to the public in january 2004 , and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track @entity102 cost $ 1.3billion ( £ 830million ) to build			0
manufacturers claim that @entity97 technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities			0
but not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe			0
@entity108 , president of the @entity70 @entity109			0
told the @entity110 that maglev trains have proved to be expensive , power - intensive , and potentially unsafe			1
' the problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the @entity116 - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system , which can send trains crashing into stuff , ' he said			2
@entity89 was the first country to have a commercially - operated @entity97 service			2
the @entity98 opened to the public in january 2004 , and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track @entity102 cost $ 1.3billion ( £ 830million ) to build ' it 's a very difficult system to make operational			0
' a new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher			0
last year , @entity89 's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the @entity132 of @entity133			2
the technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains			0
' @entity141 ( @entity140 ) systems might allow @entity97 trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude , such as super-high 3,000km ( 1,800 miles ) per hour , which could be applied to some military or space launch systems , ' the researchers write			0

maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track			2
on the right , the new @entity157 ' shinkansen ' , or bullet train , bound for @entity49 heading out of @entity160 in @entity162 prefecture on march 14			1

seven - car train beat previous record of *361mph* ( 580km/h ) set in 2003
it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway
maglev service between @entity49 and @entity50 will begin running in 2027
@entity176 's engineers are planning new attempt to reach 373mph ( 600km/h )
