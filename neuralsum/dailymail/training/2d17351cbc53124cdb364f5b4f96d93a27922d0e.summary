by @entity0 @entity1 needed : dr @entity2 , general secretary of the @entity3 , said children are being ' institutionalised ' too young children are being ‘ institutionalised ’ too young and need a decent balance between time at nursery and school and being at home with their parents , a teachers ' leader suggested today			1
parents and young children have a right to get to know each other and should have time to do so , according to dr @entity2 , general secretary of the @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
she warned that the @entity19 is the ‘ poor man of @entity23 ’ in terms of long working hours and that more needs to be done to support family life			1
dr @entity2 's comments came as education minister @entity27 said that in the past , many school nurseries could only offer standard time slots for families , making it difficult for parents trying to combine childcare with work			1
action has been taken to allow all schools to cater to younger children and to open for longer hours to give families more flexibility , she added			2
at its annual conference in @entity41 next week , @entity3 is due to debate a motion raising concerns that calls for youngsters to start school at an earlier age , along with proposals for longer school days and shorter holidays do not put children first			1
it says that strong families are the ‘ bedrock of a strong and stable society ’ and that families need a work - life balance that allows them to spend time together			0
speaking ahead of the conference , dr @entity2 said : ‘ obviously , children need a work life balance , just like their parents do			1
family time : parents and young children have a right to get to know each other and should have time to do so , dr @entity2 said ( file picture ) ‘ and for children , if you are in a childcare setting , or in a nursery , or in a school , in a sense , for them that 's work , because it is time away from home which is where they are most relaxed			1
‘ i think the motion speaks to the concern that we institutionalise our children too young , and that our children need to know their parents and parents need to know their children			2
’ children are coming to school ‘ frightened ’ after playing violent computer games , a headteacher has warned			1
in the monthly newsletter to parents of children at @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity85 voiced her concerns over some of the children playing ‘ inappropriate computer games ’			2
it is the second time she has written to parents asking them to consider the impact playing games containing 18 - rated material could be having on their children			2
she said : ‘ we are becoming increasingly aware that some of our children are playing inappropriate computer games and as a result are coming to school frightened by what they are seeing			2
‘ please do consider the impact 18 - rated material has on young children who do not understand the content and can not cope with the feelings or images they are seeing			2
‘ no apologies for repeating this item in this newsletter from the last newsletter			0
‘ i appreciate that this is only a very small minority of children , but if your child is playing @entity117 and you have not checked out what this game includes - please do so			0
’ in february , the headteacher of @entity122 , in @entity123 , @entity124 , sent a letter to parents following concerns that children as young as six were re-enacting scenes from @entity117 ( above ) , which sees players take on the role of criminals in @entity134 's dark and seedy underworld			1
@entity135 said young pupils were initiating games involving ‘ simulating rape and sexual intercourse ’ as well as having playground chats about ‘ drug use ’			2
a letter sent to parents said children were ‘ acting out scenes from the game which include the strongest of sexual swear words ’ , ‘ having conversations ’ about sexual acts and ‘ play acting extremely violent games that sometimes result in actual injury ’			1
he stressed that the letter was a way of making parents aware of the trend , rather than criticising them			0
she added : ‘ that 's not say that we are against mothers working full time , that 's not to say we 're against very good childcare facilities for young people , but we do work the longest hours in @entity23 and there is a massive pressure on family life , both parents really juggling childcare and working life			1
‘ we are the poor man of @entity23 when it comes to unpaid overtime and there is a massive pressure to be present in the workplace and there is not a culture in the @entity19 as there is in other @entity23 countries , particularly @entity182 countries , which understand that raising a family is hard work and that if we 're going to have a healthy next generation and if we 're going to make family life do - able and if we 're going to do something about the breakdown in families , the incidence of divorce and family break up then we have to do more to support family life , whether that 's both parents working , one parent working or no parents working			1
’ dr @entity2 said that high quality childcare and nurseries were one part of supporting families			1
but she added : ‘ the effect of that is diminished if your parents are exhausted and your parents are irritable and if you do n't see your parents from seven in the morning until seven at night routinely throughout the week			0
‘ there needs to be a balance between high quality childcare and the opportunity for parents , the right of parents and young children to know each other			0
i do n't think we 've got that balance right			0
’ in a speech to the @entity219 think tank in @entity221 , miss @entity27 said that government reforms have made it easier for schools to open new nurseries and operate longer hours to give families more choice			0
‘ for too long , it 's been difficult for schools to open new nursery provision and to provide the flexibility modern families need , ’ she said			0
miss @entity27 added : ‘ the vast majority of school nurseries offer only a standard nine to 12 or 12 to three slot			0
not easy for a parent who works two days a week or works shifts , trying to combine childcare with work and other commitments			0
‘ so we 've made it the case that every school - local authority , academy or free school ( independent schools can do this already ) can now lower the age range to cater for three and four - year - olds without having to go through a legal process or submit burdensome business cases ; and can open a nursery for the whole day from 8am to 6pm			0
‘ under this government , every school in the country has been given the power to open a nursery			0
‘ that means school nurseries can offer the free 15 hours of care flexibly for parents - for example , offering three five hour slots to suit a part time job			0
