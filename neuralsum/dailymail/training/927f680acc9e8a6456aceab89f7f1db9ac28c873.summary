@entity5 leading the way , @entity0 fighting for the @entity2 places and @entity3 in the relegation zone			2
the @entity8 table would certainly look very different if only goals by @entity11 players counted			1
the @entity12 would lead the standings but all their wins would be 1 - 0 and their other games would have ended goalless			0
@entity3 , who lead the way by four points in the real standings , would be 18th and still searching for their first goal of the season			0
none of their @entity11 players have yet hit the target in the @entity8 this season and the fact the @entity56 are 18 places lower in this @entity60 table shows the cosmopolitan make - up of their squad			1
@entity63 's @entity3 would be goalless if only strikes from @entity11 players counted the goals of @entity65 would have carried @entity66 to third in this @entity8 table @entity70 's goals would only carry @entity71 to a mid-table position @entity73 , @entity66 and @entity37 would occupy the @entity2 spots and the @entity75 would be the top scorers thanks mainly to the goals of @entity78 and @entity65			1
and @entity16 's seven goals for the @entity37 would have them challenging for a place in the elite @entity82 competition			0
@entity83 would find themselves down in sixth but their rivals @entity71 slump to 10th with only @entity70 's trio of goals counting .			0

table has been *released* showing the @entity8 if only goals scored by @entity11 players were counted
@entity5 would leads thanks to @entity22 , @entity30 and @entity32 but all their wins would be 1 - 0
@entity73 , @entity66 and @entity37 would make up top four
@entity71 would be mid-table , with only @entity70 scoring
but *current* leaders @entity3 would be in the relegation places
