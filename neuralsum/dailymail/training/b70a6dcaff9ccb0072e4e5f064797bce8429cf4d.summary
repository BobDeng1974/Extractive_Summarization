the veteran broadcaster revealed that he had been a patient of dr @entity8 , a @entity9 doctor ' known as the throat specialist to the stars ' for decades and recently went to visit her			1
however , during his conversation , he was unaware that dr @entity8 had been @entity15 ' personal doctor and she was the one who went with the star to @entity18 clinic on august 28			1
and the 56 - year - old @entity9 doctor , who specializes in ear , nose and throat procedures kept quiet despite allegedly being linked to the throat biopsy that led to @entity15 ' heart attack			2
on friday 's show , he said : ‘ so i said , ' why would n't ' @entity2 see somebody like you ? ' ‘ who was the ' effin idiot who went with her to the clinic ? ' he recalled asking			1
‘ what did she say ? ’ his show sidekick @entity60 asked			2
‘ she did n't say anything , of course , ’ @entity0 replied			1
a few days later , @entity0 said he realized his mistake			2
rivers arrived at the @entity69 side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist dr. @entity71 , @entity72 's medical director , on the morning on august 28			0
the procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat , and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat			0
an ear , nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic , as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star 's vocal cords			2
the doctor was described by the source as @entity2 's personal @entity93 specialist who is reported to be dr @entity8			1
according to @entity95 , dr @entity8 allegedly snapped a selfie with rivers while the 81 - year - old was under anesthesia			1
but @entity0 said he could n't imagine dr @entity8 , whom he called a ‘ marvelous physician , ’ stopping the procedure to snap a pic. @entity0 said : ‘ i would bet a lot of money she did n't take a selfie			1
why would she need to take a selfie ? ’ dr @entity8 counts @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , pop princess @entity110 and @entity111 among her celebrity patients			1
she proudly boasts a wall full of thank you notes from some of @entity118 's biggest stars			0
but it has been reported that during @entity15 visit , her vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy , cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs , which led to cardiac arrest			1

' specialist to the stars ' : dr @entity8 counts celebrities including @entity107 - who performed at @entity2 ' funeral , @entity136 ( pictured in frame ) , @entity109 and @entity110 among her clients yet @entity0 said he was surprised to hear dr @entity8 would have performed a biopsy			1
he revealed that a few years ago , she had discovered a lump and ' white stuff ' on his vocal cords , but sent him to another doctor to get a biopsy			0
‘ if she did biopsies , why did n't she do one on me ? she had plenty of opportunity , ’ he said			2
@entity0 said he plans to continue seeing dr @entity8 despite her alleged connection to @entity15 death			1
‘ i will continue to see her			0
unless she says lets go over to the clinic , ’ he said jokingly			0
dr @entity8 - who was not authorized to be in the room at the time of the fatal treatment - has also released a statement saying she has ' no comment ' to make about the tragic incident			2
