historians believe the book , compiled by the @entity17 historian @entity16 , will change the way the world views the six - month 1942 - 43 battle that cost over a million men their lives and forever destroyed @entity24 's ambitions to colonise the @entity8			1
truth be told : a new book has finally laid bare the full horrors of the @entity2 in the words of ordinary @entity5 soldiers , whose memories were suppressed by the @entity8 authorities for 70 years appalling casualties : @entity17 prisoners of war captured by the @entity5 march in a long line winding over a hill toward a prison camp near @entity2 professor @entity16 gained access to nearly 10,000 pages of documents in the history department archives at the @entity37			1
he claims the interviews demolish the myth that the @entity41 only fought out of fear and that over 13,000 soldiers were executed for cowardice - in fact , the real number was lower than 300			1
and the book has graphic and illuminating details about the disintegration of the @entity17 6th @entity41 - the conquerors of @entity49 and @entity50 - at @entity2 , some of whom were reduced to cannibalism in order to stay alive in the ruins of the city as the mercury plunged to -40c below			1
the bloodiest battle in @entity12 came to an end on january 31 , 1943 when @entity60 surrendered , disobeying the orders of his @entity62 to kill himself			1
lieutenant colonel @entity63 was the first to catch sight of @entity60 and his recollection is published for the first time in the book			1
he said : ' @entity60 lay on the bed when i entered			1
he lay there in his coat , with his cap on			1
he had two - week - old beard stubble and seemed to have lost all courage			1
' his aide , @entity75 , recalled : ' the filth and human excrement and who knows what else was piled up waist - high			1
there were two toilets and signs above them both that read : " no @entity5 allowed "			1
' ' they could have easily shot themselves , ' said major general @entity89			1
' but @entity60 and his staff chose not to do that			1
they had no intention of dying - they were such cowards			2
they did n't have the courage to die			2
' turning point : the six - month 1942 - 43 battle cost over a million men their lives and forever destroyed @entity24 's ambitions to colonise the @entity8 intense fighting : the bloodiest battle in @entity12 came to an end on january 31 , 1943 when @entity60 surrendered , disobeying the orders of his @entity62 to kill himself @entity24 was obsessed with the city that bore the name of his @entity109 nemesis and wanted it taken at all costs			1
equally , the @entity5 decided to hold it at all costs , and did so			1
the battle for @entity2 became a primitive slugging match in ruined houses , cellars and bunkers			2
between half and a million @entity5 men lost their lives , and 150,000 @entity17			1
of the 110,000 @entity17 who surrendered , only 5,000 would survive @entity123 's gulags to return to a defeated @entity17			2
the battle cost the @entity17 army a quarter of everything it possessed by way of material - guns , tanks and munitions			2
it was a defeat from which it never recovered and for days afterwards in @entity136 all shops and restaurants were closed as a mark of respect			2
the @entity9 adds a human dimension to ' private @entity89 ' , who has for decades been portrayed in the @entity140 as a man who fought with a @entity109 gun at his back			1
while there were executions , they were far below @entity147 estimates			2
the papers show that many @entity5 fought with a fanatical fervour because of the @entity151 atrocities they had seen on the road to @entity2			1
' one sees the young girls , the children , who hang from the trees in the park , ' said sniper @entity156 , adding that ' this has a tremendous impact '			2
major @entity159 told of a position that the @entity17 had abandoned			2
when he arrived there , he discovered the body of a dead comrade ' whose skin and fingernails on his right hand had been completely torn off			2
the eyes had been burnt out and he had a wound on his left temple made by a red - hot piece of iron			2
the right half of his face had been covered with a flammable liquid and ignited			0
' cost of @entity2 : between half and a million @entity5 men lost their lives , and 150,000 @entity17 also perished @entity5 defence : @entity181 card - carrying soldiers were usually the first into battle to encourage the others @entity185 described the nature of ' the @entity17 ' as follows : ' the robber mentality has become such second nature to them that they have to steal - whether they can use it or not			1
' political officers assigned to the @entity41 boosted fighting morale by convincing the ordinary soldier that their 's was a struggle for the civilians behind the lines who the @entity201 wanted to enslave			0
@entity181 card - carrying soldiers were usually the first into battle to encourage the others			0
@entity205 said : ' it was viewed as a disgrace if a communist was not the first to lead the solders into battle			0
' at the front in @entity2 , the number of card - carrying party members rose between august and october 1942 from 28,500 to 53,500			0
political officers distributed fliers in the battle zone portraying the ' hero of the day ' , including large photos of the honored soldiers			0
' at night , ' said lieutenant colonel @entity220 , ' the fighters are more inclined to speak openly , and one can crawl inside their souls			0
' the @entity9 battalion commissar @entity223 said : ' a soldier is stuck in the trenches for an entire month			1
he does n't see anyone aside from his neighbour , and suddenly the commissar approaches him , tells him something , says a friendly word to him , greets him			0
this is of enormous importance			0
' but soldiers need material comforts too and the paperwork shows how the hard pressed infantrymen received chocolate and mandarins and games to play , such as draughts and dominoes			0
' the aim was for the soldiers to no longer be driven by fear , but instead to use their political awareness to overcome their distress , ' said the professor @entity16			0
' consequently , the @entity109 saw it as a sign of weakness when captured @entity17 soldiers described themselves as apolitical			0
in their opinion , the true will to win could only be developed by those who believed they served a higher purpose			0
' the @entity109 saw the @entity41 as more politically and morally steadfast than the @entity254			0
' according to captain @entity255 , one could feel ' how every soldier and every commander was itching to kill as many @entity17 as possible '			0
the sniper @entity258 told of his despair when he shot his first @entity17			0
he said : ' i felt terrible			0
i had killed a human being			0
but then i thought of our people - and i started to mercilessly fire on them			0
i 've become a barbaric person , i kill them			0
' when he was interviewed , he had already killed 40 @entity17 - most of them with a shot to the head			0
@entity156 , the @entity41 's best sniper at @entity2 , who was played in the @entity272 movie @entity273 by @entity274 , shot 242 @entity17 , but said after the battle was over : ' you often have to remember , and the memory has a powerful impact			0
now , i have unsteady nerves and i 'm constantly shaking			0
' this did not fit in with @entity109 ideals of glory and so his comments were suppressed in the archives until accessed by professor @entity16			1
