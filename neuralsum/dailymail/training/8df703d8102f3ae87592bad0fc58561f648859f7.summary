by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 shot to fame on @entity4 as @entity6 â€™s sidekick with a penchant for peroxide blonde hair extensions , fake tan and micro pigs			1
but fast - forward three years and the 23 - year - old says she has ditched her make - up bag - and is encouraging other women to do the same			1
@entity2 is working with @entity14 to encourage young women to strip back their make - up , have the confidence to bare all and embrace their natural beauty			1
she then removed all of her make - up to convey the difference between heavily made - up and fresh - faced			1
before the shoot , @entity2 used @entity14 facial scrubs three to four times a week , to ensure her skin was perfectly prepped and radiant			1
obviously being from @entity47 , @entity2 is well aware that she and her @entity4 co-stars are famed for their love of fake tan , false eyelashes and hair extensions			2
' we are a glam bunch and image is a huge part of our lives and when the camera is rolling , we want to look as good as possible , ' she told @entity1			0
' but all the cast loves nothing more than getting home and taking over their gel nails and make - up			1
' the shoot saw over 35 make - up products being applied to her face by three make - up artists using 30 brushes over the course of almost two hours to demonstrate what a week 's worth of make - up really looks like @entity2 says she hopes to encourage other women to embrace a more natural look - and says men prefer it @entity2 says she tries to ditch the make - up four days a week , especially when she 's running errands or attending meetings			1
she said : ' i am a total girly girl and when i 'm filming @entity4 , i get glammed up but i actually try to go bare as much as possible when i 'm not on camera , ' she said			2
' i hope that my involvement will encourage other women to follow my lead , wear less make - up and embrace their natural beauty			2
i want this to show women that you can look better without make - up			2
' another reason @entity2 believes that bare - faced is best is because men prefer it			1
' @entity94 used to hate it when i wore red lipstick because we could n't kiss			0
i think men like a girl who takes good care of herself and visits the salon weekly to get her nails done and has her hair done monthly			0
it 's important to take pride in your appearance but men do n't want a girl who masks herself in make - up , they want to take her home and not have their parents judging her			1
' the newly natural star says she admires @entity116 's look because , she says , the former made in @entity120 star nails the natural look and always looks beautiful			0
the shoot saw @entity2 stripped off an entire weeks worth of make - up by a team of make - up artists @entity2 's belief that men do n't like women to mask themselves with make - up is supported by a study in which too much cosmetics was named as the top turn off by 45 per cent of men before the shoot , @entity2 used @entity14 facial scrubs three to four times a week , to ensure her skin was prepped former look : @entity137 , @entity6 , @entity2 and @entity138 showcase very different looks back in 2011 to the ones they do today ' she 's probably got loads of products on but she always looks so flawless , ' she said			1
the campaign is launched as a new study , commissioned by @entity14 , reveals that two thirds of @entity148 women mistakenly think men prefer them to wear plenty of make - up			1
half of women do their make - up almost 1,500 times a year - and two thirds go just three and a half weeks a year without wearing any slap , researchers found			2
almost one in ten women admit they wear make - up solely to impress the opposite sex			0
but their cosmetics could well hinder their love lives as three quarters of men say they actually prefer girls who adopt a more natural look			0
and 39 per cent think most women wear too much make - up and would rather they tone down their usage , with 45 per cent citing too much slap as the biggest turn off			0
aside from her duties with @entity14 , @entity2 has been busy designing her @entity174 fashion range and says she plans to expand into daywear , on top of her successful line of party dresses			0
and while she calls the bright lights of @entity181 her home , @entity2 's family actually hail from a tiny village in @entity184			0
' me and my mum are off to @entity184 to see my relatives in my time off air			0
my ancestors were monks and my grandfather was the only one to leave the village ever so we are the only tourists who ever visit			0
' i have n't been there for four years so they have n't seen me since i 've joined @entity4 - they have no idea how much has changed !			0

@entity2 , 23 , stars in @entity14 latest campaign
one image shows her with a week 's worth of make - up on
the other sees her go bare - faced , a look she loves
says men do n't want to take home a girl who cakes herself in make - up
the @entity4 girls love getting home and taking make - up off , she says
