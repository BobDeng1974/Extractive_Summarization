millions of @entity1 viewers were shocked by the harrowing video of an 11 - year - old @entity4 girl who claimed she ran away to escape an arranged marriage			1
but questions are now being raised about the authenticity of the claims by @entity9 , who claimed she was only saved from the forced engagement after her uncle intervened			1

an agreement was fixed that means @entity9 , her parents and uncle are going to move in together but in a crunch meeting that saw @entity9 face her parents , the girl tearfully asked a mediator , @entity34 president @entity33 : ‘ why do you believe them and do n't believe me ? ’ in the dialogue captured on @entity40 cameras , ms @entity33 said ‘ we need to protect this child			1
’ she added : ‘ i do n't care about what 's best for the mum or dad or uncle , just what 's best for the girl			2
’ following the meeting , which saw @entity9 and her uncle maintain that her story was definitely true , an agreement was fixed that means @entity9 , her parents and uncle are going to move in together			1
ms @entity33 had been appointed @entity9 's temporary legal guardian until the dispute was settled			2
