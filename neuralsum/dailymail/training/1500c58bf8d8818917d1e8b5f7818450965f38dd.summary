it could become the @entity1 's new ' superchopper ' - able to transport troops , carry heavy goods and be fitted out as a flying gunship			1
this futuristic helicopter from @entity7 firm @entity6 is the frontrunner to win a $ 100bn contract from the @entity10 for the next generation of attack helicopter			1
it uses two rotors to create lift , while fans propel it forward to reach 230 knots			1
it has a pair of rotors spinning in opposite directions on top of the carbon - fiber fuselage to lift it , and two fans at its rear end to push it			1
the @entity6 design is made up of counter rotating rotors on top and twin ducted - fans in the rear of the aircraft , which eliminates the necessity for a tail rotor			1
the coaxial - rotors creates lift , while the fans provide forward thrust to reach the 230 knots require by the @entity1 for the @entity47 replacement			1
the concept also has small wings in the front of the aircraft that create additional lift			2
' the @entity6 design offers the capabilities the @entity1 wants for the future fleet of utility and attack aircraft at a very attractive price , ' the firm , also called @entity6 , says			1
' the @entity60 aircraft has entry doors on both sides of the fuselage as well as a large rear ramp for easy cargo handling			0
' additionally it has retractable landing gear and the attack variant ( see below ) carries all armaments stored inside until needed which provides a “ clean ” aerodynamic design			0
@entity6 has teamed with a number of experienced aerospace companies for development of the @entity60 / @entity75 design			2
' the teaming concept has allowed @entity6 to keep the cost of development and eventual production of the aircraft lower than those of other offerings while maintaining a high level of performance by the aircraft			2
' the firm is among four vying for a $ 100bn contract for the @entity88 , and the firms are expected to begin a ' flyoff ' contest in 2017			2
the @entity6 chopper will come in several configurations , carrying cargo , troops and the injured the design will replace the @entity96 , shown here with this signing , the @entity1 has taken a large step toward developing a new family of aircraft referred to as			1
' this is a critical risk reducing effort for the @entity103 , ' said maj. gen. @entity104 , program executive officer for aviation			0
' the operational benefits and changes will depend on the capabilities we can deliver to the war fighter with @entity75			0
' improved speed , range , reliability , and survivability are critical goals that we will target			0
' the @entity6 , which could replace the @entity47 , is what 's known as a compact coaxial - rotor / ducted - fan concept			2
it is made up of counter rotating rotors on top and twin ducted - fans in the rear of the aircraft , which eliminates the necessity of a tail rotor			0
the coaxial - rotors creates lift , while the fans provide forward thrust to reach the 230 knots require by the @entity1 for the @entity47 replacement			1
the concept also has small wings in the front of the aircraft that create additional lift			0
the aircraft will weight 27,000lb ( 12,000kg ) , lift 13,000lb ( 5.900kg ) , and carry 12 combat troops plus 4 crew members			0
the superchopper can also be fitted with advanced weapons and missile systems according to @entity143 , the @entity6 design is the frontrunner for the contest			1
' @entity6 ’s coaxial - rotor / ducted - fan concept increases efficiency in all aspects of flight , while reducing vibration , ' it said			0
' out of all @entity60 concepts presented by the competing parties , none look as complete , practical , futuristic , and ready as @entity6 ’s aircraft			0
' it is thrilling to see how new ideas broad by a startup aircraft company , few people ever heard before , will stack - up against the arrogance of the @entity162 defense establishment			0

@entity6 design *believed* to be frontrunner to @entity1 contract
uses two rotors to create lift , while fans propel it forward to reach 230 knots
firm also developing *civilian* version of the helicopter
