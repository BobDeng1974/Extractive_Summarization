if it feels as though summer has come early , that ’s because we ’re already enjoying august temperatures			1
this week ’s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern @entity6 is to continue – and warm up			2
the temperature in the @entity8 is forecast to reach @entity9 ( @entity10 ) today and @entity11 ( @entity12 ) tomorrow , surpassing the highest seen so far this year , the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) recorded in @entity15 on friday			2
the delightful weather , caused by warm air blowing up from the @entity18 , is creating conditions we might usually experience in july or august			1
the record for the hottest day ever in @entity52 was set more than a decade ago in august 2003 when temperatures hit @entity58 ( @entity59 ) in @entity60 , @entity61			1
@entity63 ’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1 , while @entity65 has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever			2
there has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather , and @entity70 has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed @entity73 ( @entity74 ) this year			1
@entity65 is also offering 8/1 that the april record of @entity76 ( @entity77 ) set in 1949 in @entity78 , north @entity15 , will be broken by the end of the month			0
the forecast for today is actually warmer than the @entity81 ( @entity82 ) average daytime temperature in august , and way ahead of the @entity84 ( 52f ) normally expected in april			1
this weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow , but the clear skies and above - average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week			1
@entity89 spokesman @entity88 said last night : ‘ we are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days			1
unless you are in north - west @entity93 , which will see quite a lot of rain , it will be dry and sunny			0
‘ on tuesday we could see @entity96 to @entity97 ( 73f to @entity12 ) in prolonged sunshine			0
that is double the daytime average for this time of year			0
‘ wednesday will be @entity101 to @entity97 ( @entity102 to @entity12 ) or higher in places			0
thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens			0
wednesday warmth : most of @entity6 and @entity26 will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting @entity32 later this week @entity109 awakening : the morning mist looking out across the @entity113 village of @entity114 , near @entity115 , which woke to a frost going for a walk : a deer in the morning mist near @entity114 in @entity113 yesterday , as @entity52 prepared for the warmest weather of the year so far ‘ there is a cold air mass arriving on thursday night but it is expected to stay dry well into next week			1
after that we can be less certain			0
’ the spell of warm weather , which has now lasted more than a week , has seen people flocking to the nation ’s beaches			1
among them were swimmers in the @entity130 who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters			0
barrel jellyfish , which have tentacles up to six feet long , were spotted near @entity135 in south @entity136			0
the species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the @entity139 , but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore			2
the species is harmless to humans , but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way			2
beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting			0
@entity136 vet @entity156 , whose son @entity157 had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking , said : ‘ no doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather			2
i have never seen them so early in the year			0
could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year			0
’ after the bad smog seen late last week in the @entity168 , the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days			2
poor visibility : a fog - shrouded @entity172 seafront yesterday , in stark contrast to yesterday 's sunshine , as more warm temperatures are on the way apocalypse wow ! it could be a poster for the 1979 @entity179 film , but this stunning sunrise , behind dredger @entity180 , painted the skies in @entity60 , @entity61 spectacular start : the sun rises over fishing boats off the @entity187 near @entity189 bay in @entity190 yesterday morning over the water : sunrise near @entity189 bay in @entity190 , as @entity52 basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far but pollution levels will increase again on thursday and friday , particularly in the @entity130 , where @entity196 and @entity136 are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels			1
the @entity89 three - month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer			1
but thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent			0
a spokesman said : ‘ unfortunately , the weather we get in april does n’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect			2
‘ we ’re still in the midst of spring , so it ’s far too early to say what the months of june , july and august may hold			1
’ @entity65 spokesman @entity214 said yesterday : ‘ the money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise			2
‘ this is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming			0
’ and @entity225 from @entity63 added : ' the @entity52 public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting			0
' hot day : these graphics show the cloud coverage and temperatures tomorrow , with the @entity168 expected to have the best weather arriving : the predicted hot weather this week is the result of a plume of warm air heading towards the @entity52 from the south west @entity241 for cold , red for hot : these graphics from @entity244 show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow ( left ) and wednesday ( right ) a third of weather bets to @entity65 have come from punters in the @entity168 - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week			1
and the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been £ 1,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in january			0
meanwhile , @entity63 - @entity255 's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer			1
the @entity89 has confirmed that hotter - than - average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below - average conditions until june			1
it said in a long - range forecast that ‘ much of the tropical @entity262 remains warmer than average and close to @entity265 thresholds ’			1
@entity265 - the warming of @entity262 sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south - east @entity269 and @entity270 as well as floods in @entity272			2
the @entity89 says most climate models ‘ now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed @entity265 thresholds in late spring or early summer ’			1
with @entity52 set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week , thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach			1
but firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water - related deaths in the @entity52 in 2013			1
the act , known as ‘ tombstoning ’ , can lead to people suffering ‘ cold water shock ’ when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water			1
@entity291 assistant commissioner @entity290 said : ‘ rivers , lakes and canals may look inviting , especially on a hot day and after a drink			0
‘ but it ’s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse , kill you			2
’ on the first - ever @entity301 and @entity302 , firefighters added that the 16 - 30 age group was worst - hit by water deaths in 2013			1

kayaker @entity156 , a seasoned sea watcher , was stunned to see the giant creatures off @entity135 in @entity136			0
the barrel jellyfish , which have tentacles up to 6ft long , were pictured floating next to mr @entity156 ’s kayak in the sun - drenched blue waters			2
up close : @entity156 's son @entity157 had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near @entity135 off the coast of @entity136 the species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the @entity139			1

beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting			0
floating : the dustbin lid - shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way the @entity344 says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth			0
