by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 12:21 est , 25 june 2012 baboons can distinguish between written words and gibberish - and other apes can do multiplication and even make plans for the future			1
the number of ape and monkey cognition studies has doubled in recent years , often with better technology and neuroscience paving the way to unusual discoveries			1
scientists think that many abilities - such as working out what others are thinking - are not exclusive to human beings			0
‘ it 's not a question of whether they think - it 's how they think , ’ says @entity20 scientist @entity19			0
a 5 1/2 - year - old chimpanzee named @entity27 performs a memory test with randomly - placed consecutive numerals an orangutan presses symbols to communicate at @entity32 in @entity33			1
experts who work with primates have been using sign language and other methods to communicate with apes for years this month scientists mapping the dna of the bonobo ape found that , like the chimp , bonobos are only 1.3 percent different from humans			1
says @entity45 , director of the primate research center at the @entity47 in @entity48 : ‘ every year we discover things that we thought they could not do			1
’ call says one of his recent more surprising studies showed that apes can set goals and follow through with them			1
orangutans and bonobos in a zoo were offered eight possible tools - two of which would help them get at some food			1
at times when they chose the proper tool , researchers moved the apes to a different area before they could get the food , and then kept them waiting as much as 14 hours			1
in nearly every case , when the apes realized they were being moved , they took their tool with them so they could use it to get food the next day , remembering that even after sleeping			1
after being told a word , an orangutan points to that object on an @entity75 computer tablet at @entity32 zoo in @entity33 the goal and series of tasks did n't leave the apes ' minds			1
call says this is similar to a person packing luggage a day before a trip : ‘ for humans it 's such a central ability , it 's so important			1
’ for a few years , scientists have watched chimpanzees in zoos collect and store rocks as weapons for later use			0
in may , a study found they even add deception to the mix. they created haystacks to conceal their stash of stones from opponents , just like nations do with bombs			0
@entity19 points to studies where competing chimpanzees enter an arena where one bit of food is hidden from view for only one chimp			1
the chimp that can see the hidden food , quickly learns that his foe ca n't see it and uses that to his advantage , displaying the ability to perceive another ape 's situation			0
that 's a trait humans develop as toddlers , but something we thought other animals never got , @entity19 said			1
and then there is the amazing monkey memory			1
after being told a word , an orangutan points to that object on an @entity75 at @entity32 in @entity33 @entity131 says orangutans are extremely intelligent but limited by their physical inability to talk			1
@entity131 and other trainers at @entity32 have developed strong relationships with the orangutans and hope to have them eventually use the @entity75 to communicate with other people at the @entity142 in @entity143 , humans who try to match their recall skills with an orangutan 's are humbled			1
zoo associate director @entity144 says : ‘ i 've got a ph.d. , for @entity148 's sake , you would think i could out - think an orang and i ca n't			2
’ in @entity152 research , at least two baboons kept memorizing so many pictures - several thousand - that after three years researchers ran out of time before the baboons reached their limit			2
researcher @entity158 at the @entity159 figured they could memorize at least 10,000 and probably more			0
and a chimp in @entity162 named @entity27 who sees strings of numbers flash on a screen for a split - second regularly beats humans at accurately duplicating the lineup			2
he 's a @entity169 sensation , along with orangutans in a @entity33 zoo that use @entity75			1
the trend in research is to identify some new thinking skill that chimps can do , revealing that certain abilities are ‘ not uniquely human , ’ said @entity178 primatologist @entity177			0
then the scientists find that same ability in other primates further removed from humans genetically			2
then they see it in dogs and elephants			0
‘ capacities that we think in humans are very special and complex are probably not so special and not so complex , ’ @entity186 said			2
‘ this research in animals elevates the animals , but it also brings down the humans ...			2
if monkeys can do it and maybe dogs and other animals , maybe it 's not as complex as you think			0
’ at @entity20 , professor @entity200 shows videos of monkeys that appear to be doing a ‘ fuzzy representation ’ of multiplication by following the number of dots that go into a box on a computer screen and choosing the right answer to come out of the box			2
this is after they 've already done addition and subtraction			0
this spring in @entity152 , researchers showed that six baboons could distinguish between fake and real four - letter words - @entity217 vs @entity219 , for example			1
and they chose to do these computer - based exercises of their own free will , either for fun or a snack			0
one reason scientists are learning more about animal intellect is computers , including touch screens			0
in some cases , scientists are setting up banks of computers available to primates 24 - 7			0
in the @entity152 word recognition experiment , @entity158 found he got more and better data when it was the baboons ' choice to work			2
animal cognition researcher @entity239 at the @entity241 in @entity242 agrees			0
‘ the apes in our case seem to be working better when they have that control , that choice to perform , ’ he said			2
in the @entity152 study , the baboons can recognize that the letters kite make a word because through trial and error they learn which letters tend to go together in what order			1
but the baboons do n't have a clue of what kite means			0
it 's that gap that 's key			0
‘ the boundaries are not as sharp as people think , but there are certain things you ca n't overcome and language is one of them , ’ said @entity263 animal cognition researcher @entity262			0
and that leads to another difference , @entity239 said			0
because apes lack language skills , they learn by watching and mimicking			0
humans teach with language and explanation , which is faster and better , @entity239 said .			0

baboons can tell real words from random *jumbles* of letters
other studies show that apes can do multiplication
@entity289 utans in @entity33 zoo use @entity75
monkey studies hint that humans are not as unique as we thought
