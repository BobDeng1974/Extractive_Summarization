by @entity0 published : 02:53 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 06:59 est , 8 august 2012 @entity1 has been accused of having major lapses in its online security after a writer had his ' entire digital life ' destroyed by hackers in less than an hour @entity1 has told its support staff to stop changing user passwords over the phone after a reporter lost his digital life , it was claimed today			1
@entity12 , a reporter for @entity13 , lost control of his @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 accounts after a hacker rang @entity1 's support and managed to change his @entity1 @entity22 password			1
he was also locked out of his @entity23 , and then the hacker wiped his laptop , meaning @entity12 lost all his images of his one - year - old daughter			1
the story became a viral hit after @entity12 wrote about it			0
reacting to the scandal , @entity1 has now suspended all password changes over the phone for the next 24 hours , according to an @entity1 employee who spoke to @entity13			1
@entity1 were apparently allowing password changes on the phone yesterday - if users had their @entity23 to hand and could read the serial number of the device to @entity1			1
the employee told @entity13 he believed the freeze was in place ' to give @entity1 more time to determine what security policies needed to be changed , if any '			1
@entity43 have also closed a security hole which allowed anyone to take control of an @entity43 account if they knew a customer 's name , e-mail address and home address			0
it is still possible to change your @entity1 password online by visiting @entity56			1
@entity1 has yet to comment on whether they are permanently changing their security passwords			1
in a disturbing article on @entity60 , @entity12 reveals how he actually spoke to the hacker who carried out the attack			0
after telling him how he did it @entity64 was then able to repeat the same steps - and carry out his very own mock hack			2
in the story @entity12 writes that on august 3 he realised something was wrong when all of a sudden his @entity23 powered down			1
when he tried to connect it to his computer he was asked for a four digit pin - which the hackers had already put on the machine to stop him from accessing it			2
during the hour - and - a - half long phone call with @entity76 - during which they initially got his name wrong and looked at the wrong account - the full story emerged			1
between 4.33pm and 5.12pm the hackers had gone from having no information to taking over his whole digital life - and posting a message on his @entity18 page claiming credit for doing it			1
@entity12 writes : ‘ it turns out , a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card number are the only two pieces of information anyone needs to get into your @entity97 account			0
‘ once supplied , @entity1 will issue a temporary password , and that password grants access to @entity97			1
’ writer @entity101 had his @entity102 wiped by hackers who exploited a loophole in @entity1 's security ptotocols from there the hackers were able to access his other accounts as they were all linked to one another - they went to his @entity17 account and asked for the recovery password to be sent to his mac.com email , which they already had access to			1
once they had access to his @entity17 account , they were able to get control of his @entity18 page too			1
after accepting what had happened @entity12 set up a temporary @entity18 account - and was shocked when one of the hackers messaged him			1
identifying himself as @entity127 , he explained how he hacked @entity64 just because he ‘ liked his username ’ and claimed that ‘ you honestly can get into any email associated with apple ’			0
@entity12 discovered that the hack began when @entity127 got his billing address by searching his web domain on @entity136 or @entity137 , which includes details of where a person lives			0
his credit card number was obtained by taking advantage of another security breach - this time on @entity43			2
@entity12 writes : ‘ first you call @entity43 and tell them you are the account holder , and want to add a credit card number to the account			0
most people should be aware of the importance of keeping passwords and logins secure , to regularly change passwords , and to watch out for ' social engineering ' , where hackers can gain access to your accounts by fooling people into revealing confidential information			2
additionally , users should remember : ‘ all you need is the name on the account , an associated e-mail address , and the billing address			0
‘ @entity43 then allows you to input a new credit card			0
( @entity13 used a bogus credit card number from a website that generates fake card numbers that conform with the industry ’s published self - check algorithm			2
) then you hang up			0
‘ next you call back , and tell @entity43 that you ’ve lost access to your account			1
upon providing a name , billing address , and the new credit card number you gave the company on the prior call , @entity43 will allow you to add a new e-mail address to the account			0
‘ from here , you go to the @entity43 website , and send a password reset to the new e-mail account			2
' this allows you to see all the credit cards on file for the account — not the complete numbers , just the last four digits			0
but , as we know , @entity1 only needs those last four digits			2
’ @entity12 admits that he only has himself to blame for being hacked and wishes he had taken better security steps , such as not ‘ daisy chaining ’ his accounts together			0
he wishes he had not set up ‘ find my @entity194 ’ , which allowed the hackers to set up a pin and freeze him out of his computer			0
but he also believes that it is still too easy to hack into an @entity1 account , and claims that anyone could repeat what @entity127 did			2
@entity12 said : ‘ my experience leads me to believe that cloud - based systems need fundamentally different security measures			0
‘ password - based security mechanisms - which can be cracked , reset , and socially engineered - no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing			2
’ in a statement to @entity13 , @entity1 spokesman @entity209 said : ‘ @entity1 takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an @entity1 @entity22 password			1
‘ in this particular case , the customer ’s data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer			0
‘ in addition , we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely			0
' we are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers ’ data is protected			0

@entity1 believed to have suspended password changes over the phone for 24 hours while it reviews policies
reporter lost access to @entity17 , @entity18 and his @entity23 - and lost *precious* *photographs* of his daughter
