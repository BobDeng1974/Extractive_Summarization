attorney general , @entity0 , referred the case on the basis that the suspended sentence was unduly lenient appeal court judges have allowed a rapist who attacked a lesbian after a @entity8 party to walk free because they do not want to interfere with his suspended sentence the 28 year old from @entity10 preyed on his victim after watching ' @entity12 ' - even though he knew she had no interest in men			1
the woman was left deeply traumatised by the attack , but @entity19 judges have today refused to jail the attacker , describing his case as ' exceptional '			2
the attorney general , @entity0 , had referred the case on the basis that the suspended two year prison sentence imposed at @entity26 in october was unduly lenient			1
but today , while a panel of three judges headed by @entity30 agreed with that view , they said they did not consider it to be in the public interest that it should be changed			2
they heard that the man , who has @entity37 's syndrome , obsessive compulsive disorder , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , anxiety and depression , had reported the rape to police himself - and if he had not , it would never have come to light			2
the man committed the offence after a @entity8 party when a friend who he knew had no sexual interest in men , invited him to share her bed - which they had done before - purely to sleep			1
the court heard neither of them anticipated or intended sexual activity but during the night the man began touching her			2
the ' obsessive part ' of his personality took over and , despite her struggles , he had sex with the woman			0
when he came to his senses and stopped he apologised profusely , ' punched himself in remorse ' and left , while the woman , who made it clear their friendship was ruined , decided she did not want to report the matter to the police			0
two years later , distressed and still feeling guilty , he went to the police , saying he wanted to confess to a sexual assault and that he thought he needed help			0
the man was handed a suspended two year prison sentence at @entity26 ( pictured ) in october the man pleaded guilty to the rape at @entity26 and was handed a suspended two - year jail term in october last year			1
lawyers representing the attorney general told the @entity19 the sentence was far too soft			1
lord @entity30 agreed a suspended sentence was ' unduly lenient ' - but said it would be wrong to lock him up now			1
he said the man suffered from a litany of mental health problems and both he and his victim were ' vulnerable '			2
the judge , sitting with mrs @entity95 and judge @entity96 , ruled it was ' not in the public interest ' to put him behind bars			0
what he had done ' caused him distress and an enduring sense of guilt ' , said the judge			0
@entity107 , for the attorney general , argued that the man should have been jailed			1
but lord justice @entity30 described it as ' an exceptionally sensitive and difficult ' case			1
he said for all his remorse , there was no doubt that he had done ' a grave wrong ' with serious consequences for his victim			0
lord @entity30 ( pictured ) agreed a suspended sentence was ' unduly lenient ' - but said it would be wrong to lock up the man now lord @entity30 said that the man had made a fully committed start to his suspended sentence order and had proved himself highly and genuinely motivated to make progress			1
he said a rupture of current arrangements could only make more certain serious deterioration in his condition , and put at risk a successful outcome			0
he said : ' what sets this case apart is the distress the offender himself suffers from unwelcome thoughts , his feelings of guilt and fear of catastrophe , and his almost inevitable mental deterioration if required to serve a sentence of imprisonment			2
' ' there is no statutory standard of exceptionality that must be reached before a court suspends a sentence of imprisonment			0
' it is a matter for the court 's judgment , usually determined by weighing up the seriousness of the offence , the offender 's antecedents and his personal circumstances			0
' however , for an offence as serious as rape , a suspended sentence order is , as the recorder acknowledged , almost unheard of			1
' he concluded that the man was now responding well to professional help with his mental health problems			0
that was the best means of reducing his risk to the public and jailing him , the judge concluded , would not be in the public interest .			0
