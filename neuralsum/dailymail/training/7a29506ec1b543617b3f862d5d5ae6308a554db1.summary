by @entity0 a @entity2 inspired @entity3 of computer security experts will be set up to protect @entity6 's businesses and help the armed forces at times of national emergency , it has emerged today			1
these ' reservists ' will work alongside a new team of internet boffins who had helped the government protect the @entity6 from cyber attack during last summer 's @entity15			1
official figures show that 90 per cent of all big business in @entity6 was attacked online in 2011 - costing them at least £ 250,000 each			1
security : inspired by the @entity2 portrayed in @entity3 - the government is forming a team of reservists to protect @entity6 's businesses and armed forces from cyber attack online industries are worth £ 82billion a year to @entity6 , so cabinet office minister @entity27 has announced the measures to protect those that ' suffer at the hands of such threats '			1
as part of the plan the @entity34 will set up a ' cyber reserve ' it could bring in when it needed help			2
while three universities : @entity40 , the @entity38 and @entity39 , will be used to train their students in computer security to form the next generation of @entity6 cyber guardians			1
' we are constantly examining new ways to harness and attract the talents of the cyber security specialists that are needed for critical areas of work , ' mr @entity27 said in a written answer to @entity52			0
home secretary @entity53 wants security services to be able to snoop on email and internet records , but @entity57 is seeking to delay the @entity58 ' to this end , the @entity34 is taking forward the development of a ‘ cyber reserve ’ , allowing the services to draw on the wider talent and skills of the nation in the cyber field			1
' the @entity69 idea is ' currently in development ' , he said , adding : ' working with the private sector to improve awareness of the need for better cyber security continues to be a priority '			0
water and power firms in particular are being targeted by foreign countries launching cyber attacks against @entity6			1
the services ‘ upon which daily life depends ’ risk being disrupted by hackers working for the @entity6 's enemies , officials claimed			1
internet terrorism from ‘ hostile foreign states ’ is now one of the top four threats @entity6 faces			1
the scale of the problem comes as home secretary @entity53 stepped up her call for more powers to track email and internet use			1
she claimed people will ‘ die ’ without more powers to track terrorists , paedophiles and criminals online			2
a major @entity103 split was laid bare as mrs may took a swipe at @entity106 leader @entity57 for blocking new internet powers to break up criminal plots on sites like @entity110 and @entity111			2
the £ 2billion law – dubbed a snoopers charter - would store billions of pieces of private information from emails , @entity110 , texts and internet use			2
in a thinly - veiled swipe at her @entity121 colleague , mrs may said opponents of her legislation are ' putting politics before people ’s lives ’			2
mrs may said opponents of her @entity58 had to ' look victims of terrorism in the eye ' , like those caught up in the 7/7 @entity133 bombings mr @entity57 wants to delay the @entity58 until 2014 to strike a balance between security and liberty ’			1
but mrs may said : ‘ the people who say they ’re against this bill need to look victims of serious crime , terrorism and child sex offences in the eye and tell them why they ’re not prepared to give the police the powers they need to protect the public			1
‘ we would certainly see criminals going free as a result of this			0
there will be paedophiles who will not be identified and it will reduce our ability to deal with this serious organised crime , ’ she told @entity146 mrs may suggested the new laws were needed to prevent a repeat of the 7/7 @entity133 bombings or the shootings of two female police officers in @entity160 in september			0
‘ the shootings of @entity162 and @entity162 brought everybody up sharp to show the extent of the problem that can be caused by criminals			0
‘ it would be harder for us to crack into organised crime gangs , and yes we could see people dying as a result of not being able to have access to this information			0
’ she went on : ' criminals , terrorists and paedophiles will want mps to vote against this bill			0
' victims of crime , police and the public will want them to vote for it			0
it 's a question of whose side you 're on			0
' however , a committee of mps and peers is expected to issue damning criticism of the measures this week , arguing ministers have not made the case that is really needed			0
the @entity194 insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 months , along with use of @entity111 and even online games consoles , will protect national security			2
without it , police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time , they argue			0
cyber attacks have been launched against the supplies ' upon which daily life depends , ' including power firms officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images			1
gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data			0
the plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made , not what was said			0
the content of emails would also not be stored , just details of who sent and received them .			0
