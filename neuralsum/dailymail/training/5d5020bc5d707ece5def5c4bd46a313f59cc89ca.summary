by @entity0 and @entity1 a community outraged over the death of a 14 - year - old skateboarder who was struck by a car only 100 metres from his home on saturday say it 's the second time in just six months a child 's been killed on the suburb 's ' dangerous and deadly ' roads			1
the tragic death of @entity11 , from @entity12 in @entity13 , comes only months after nine - year - old @entity14 died after he was hit by a car on nearby @entity16 in december			1
a student at @entity18 , @entity11 died at the scene of the crash when the driver of a four - wheel - drive ran into him on the island 's main road , @entity25 , at about 5.20 pm			1
police claim the driver of the @entity28 had been drinking , however no charges have been laid			0
blaming the lack of a footpath and street lights on the main thoroughfare for causing the accidents , they have continued a campaign which began back in 2011			1
the grandmother of @entity14 , @entity47 , told the @entity48 she does have concerns regarding road safety in the area , but also suggested drivers involved in these incidents should be tested for drugs , not just alcohol			2
ms @entity47 added that there needs to be a greater focus on road safety education			0
' i believe that kids should have far more education on road safety , the law changed [ so ] that police can charge a youngster under 10 for not wearing safety gear , which currently police can not do			0
' ' my daughter will be campaigning against the above concerns not footpaths			0
' though she also voiced her concerns about the safety of the island 's main road			1
' @entity25 is a health hazard			1
i used to ride a bicycle down that street and always feared for my life as the road is very narrow			0
' if a car passes a bike it has to almost cross onto the other side and hope no car comes from that direction			0
' the times when i had to go into the gutter or off road into slippery gravel were numerous and women walk down that road on the road with prams			0
' @entity14 was tragically killed on the same small island on a nearby road in december of last year @entity12 is a small community located 40 kilometres south - east of @entity97 @entity12 is a small island which is about eight kilometres long and just under three kilometres wide , located off the @entity13 coast 40 kilometres south - east of @entity97			1
the mother of one of @entity11 ’s close friends and a resident of @entity12 , @entity103 , has taken the lead in the protests by sharing video footage of the condition of the island ’s footpaths			1
' i just promised my 14 year old son he will not lose another mate on this island because council do not provide basic infrastructure nor do they care , ' mrs @entity103 wrote			2
' all we are asking for is a footpath and lighting on the main road that i believe is approximately 8.5km long			2
' the video shows an unknown person walking along a narrow path on the island 's main road , which only extends up to two kilometres , according to mrs hill			1
the short path is boarded by dense shrubs on one side and the edge of a busy road on the other			2
the rest of the way , residents are forced to walk along the road			0
' @entity11 was a beautiful boy and he died way too soon from that something that could have been avoided , ' mrs @entity103 said			2
' he was actually seen on that footpath and then was forced onto that road again to get home because there 's nowhere to walk			2
@entity12 resident and the mother of one of @entity11 's friends , is petitioning her local council for changes to be made @entity11 's death has sparked outrage amongst community members who blame a lack of basic pedestrian infrastructure for his death ' we have a main road with very little lighting and no footpath			1
it 's utterly and completely ridiculous			0
' what we 're trying to do is get as many people to write to councilors , our mp and our mayor and say this is inadequate			0
this is a basic duty of care , not just to our children but a lot of our population are elderly who have mobility scooters and they ’re on the road because there ’s no footpaths - in the dark			2
' another @entity176 resident , @entity175 , said infrastructure for the neighboring @entity178 , would also be included in their demands			0
residents have so far bombarded their local council with letters and plan to meet with their mayor in the coming week for discussions			0
@entity11 's devastated high school friends have also planned to write tributes to the 14 - year - old on a pole at their school			1
@entity14 's death at the end of 2013 also sparked outrage from the small close - knit community , and friends and family were further upset when council apparently removed his road - side memorial from the place he was struck			1
the @entity200 are still investigating both incidents , and charges are yet to be laid over either incident			0

@entity11 died after being hit by a @entity208 on @entity12
in december , nine - year - old @entity14 was also *fatally* hit by a car
@entity14 's grandmother said @entity25 , where @entity11 was killed is a ' health hazard '
residents on the island are blaming poor roadside infrastructure
the island 's main road has no street lights or footpath for *commuters* , forcing elderly , children and pram pushing mothers onto the busy road
