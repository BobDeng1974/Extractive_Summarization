by @entity0 around 50 @entity1 patrol cars have had their recording devices deliberately disabled , an investigation found			1
all @entity1 police cars are fitted with equipment that automatically records what officers say while outside their vehicles , but antennas for the system in half of the estimated 80 cars in one south @entity15 division were missing , with 10 having been removed in another division			1
along with footage shot from an in - car camera - which activates automatically when the emergency lights and siren are switched on - the audio - recording equipment guards against members of the public making false accusations against officers and deters malpractice			1
tampering : small audio transmitters worn by police officers wear on their belts to allow them to be recorded in the field by their patrol car receiver			0
they are shown here with broken antennas during a demonstration for media in @entity15 on tuesday an officer ’s voice is beamed back to the in - car recording equipment from a transmitter in his or her belt			2
the removal of the antenna does n’t necessarily mean the voice can not be recorded – but it does cut down the range by up to a third , according to @entity1 ’s expert on the equipment , sgt. @entity47			2
what will have caused extra worry to police chiefs is that antennas had been removed from cars that patrol areas of @entity15 – such as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 – where community relations with the police are often seriously fractured			1
monitoring : all @entity1 patrol cars have in - car video equipment , which also records audio from officers when outside the vehicle			1
pictured is @entity1 sgt. @entity47 , a department expert on recording devices @entity67 : sgt @entity47 shows the protected location of an antenna for an audio receiver @entity73 president @entity72 told @entity74 : ‘ this equipment is for the protection of the public and of the officers			2
to have people who do n't like the rules to take it upon themselves to do something like this is very troubling			0
’ @entity1 chiefs were informed that the antennas were being tampered with in the summer of 2013 , but did not attempt to track down who was responsible			2
this was deemed as a futile endeavour as several teams of officers use the same car			0
instead warnings were issued and a system put in place that logs the status of the antennas on cars from shift to shift			0
president @entity72 added : ‘ on an issue like this , we need to be brought in right away			0
’ @entity1 chief @entity103 had informed the @entity73 in september that the issue was being dealt with			0
however , an investigation into a shooting incident in february in which audio recordings of officers at the scene varied hugely in quality indicated that efforts to deal with the problem had n’t fully succeeded			0
concern : police chiefs noted that antennas had been removed from patrol cars that often visit some of @entity15 's most deprived areas			1

around 50 @entity1 patrol cars have had antennas for recording *kit* removed
the equipment deters false accusations and *misconduct*
tampering took place on cars patrolling some of @entity15 's most troubled areas
