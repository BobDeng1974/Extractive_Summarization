@entity0 cruised to a 6 - 1 victory against @entity2 rivals @entity3 last night			2
but not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes , as the @entity8 club 's manager @entity6 broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy			1
to put it bluntly , he split his pants			0
a flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players			2
' @entity6 would n't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side			1
the current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small , presumably to showcase a well - honed physique , has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind			1
so , who 's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks ? @entity58			0
in danger of restricting the blood flow			0
yes , it 's officially a wardrobe malfunction ... but has @entity6 simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side ? blame 007 : @entity67 wore a close - fitting @entity69 suit in 2012 @entity71 movie @entity72 ... and thousands of men followed the trend and breathe ! if @entity75 gets the snug look just right , his fellow @entity78 boys , including @entity79 ( pictured right ) are guilty of going a little too tight the rock star 's take on the whistle and flute : @entity83 does n't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny , while @entity58 goes for a second ( snake ) skin with his casual version of the suit king of the second skin ! @entity59 rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy the trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with ' skinny ' , ' slim ' and ' heritage ' fits all offering a snugger - looking silhouette			1
cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of @entity71 , in @entity99 ' 2012 movie @entity72 , was seen wearing the kind of form - fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it and brawl on top of a train while hurtling through @entity108			2
throughout the film , an unruffled @entity67 sported a grey , tailored suit by @entity69 which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look			0
during his just - ended eight - year reign on @entity117 , @entity59 's suits have got progressively smaller , seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show			1
@entity59 said at the time : ' i remember having a wardrobe malfunction on @entity117			1
' i had this tight - fitting @entity124 suit and felt the trousers rip â€¦ from pole to pole , shall we say			1
i just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best			0
' high street menswear retailer @entity132 & @entity134 told @entity135 that figure - hugging clothes are no longer just for women			2
not much room to give ! @entity60 , who split his trousers on stage in @entity141 in 2012 , sails close to the wind again here while performing at the @entity144 in 2013 a thigh - ful ! @entity147 stars @entity148 and @entity149 are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear @entity153 , head of brand for the company said : ' the skinny look has taken over everyone 's wardrobe , regardless of gender			1
' men have been wearing tight t - shirts and shirts for a while now - our best - selling shirt is now an extra slim one			1
' remember , men do n't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week			1
the office is just as much their chance to shine , so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment			0
' other stars who 've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow x factor presenter @entity60 , whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at @entity182 in 2012			1
wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants , the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants			0
for more examples , you only have to wander to the streets of @entity193 or @entity78 , as the reality television stars who grace our screens on @entity197 is @entity78 and made in @entity193 do n't appear to own a more roomy suit between them			0
@entity147 star @entity148 is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and @entity149 is also partial to a tight pair of strides			0
while @entity75 rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion , he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit , and arguably carries it off to perfection			2
what do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit ? fashion blogger @entity213 is n't convinced by the current trend			1
he told @entity135 : ' over the last couple of years , terms like ' super skinny ' and ' ultra skinny ' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting , and to be quite honest , they scare me			0
' ' there 's the circulation - restricting connotations the words ' ultra skinny ' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too - tight suit can be quite hideous to look at			2
' men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much , he adds			0
' you do n't want to show the world everything you 've got ! ' some things should remain , erm , under wraps			0
you find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits , and the results are disastrous			2
' as male models get thinner , so do suit cuts , but this is not representative of this country			0
us men with ' real ' bodies need suits that do n't feel restricting			1
and do n't restrict blood flow			0
' who should you go for if you want comfort and style ? ' designer labels such as @entity254 and @entity256 offer suits that have a bit of breathing room			0
' let 's hope @entity6 , @entity59 and @entity60 are reading .			1

@entity35 *football* manager tore the side of his trousers exposing his thigh
@entity6 said later : ' i 'll have to buy new ones for the next match '
trend for tight suits has seen @entity59 and @entity60 left red - faced
