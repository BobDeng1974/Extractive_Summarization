when a huge star many times the mass of the sun comes to the end of its life it collapses in on itself and forms a singularity - creating a black hole where gravity is so strong that not even light itself can escape			1
at least , that ’s what we thought			0
a scientist has sensationally said that it is impossible for black holes to exist - and she even has mathematical proof to back up her claims			1
if true , her research could force physicists to scrap their theories of how the universe began			2
a scientist from @entity24 states she has mathematical proof that black holes ( illustrated ) ca n't exist			1
she said it is impossible for stars to collapse and form a singularity			2
previously , scientists thought stars larger than the sun collapsed under their own gravity and formed black holes as they died the research was conducted by professor @entity34 from the @entity24 at @entity35 in the @entity36 and scientists			1
she claims that as a star dies , it releases a type of radiation known as hawking radiation - predicted by professor @entity42			2
one of the biggest unanswered questions about black holes is the so - called information paradox			0
under current theories for black holes it is thought that nothing can escape from the event horizon around a black hole - not even light itself			1
inside the black hole is thought to be a singularity where matter is crushed to an infinitesimally small point as predicted by @entity56 's theory of gravity			1
however , a fundamental law of quantum theory states that no information from the universe can ever disappear			0
this creates a paradox ; how can a black hole make matter and information ' disappear ' ? professor @entity34 's new theory manages to explain why this might be so - namely because black holes as we know them can not exist			1
however in this process , professor @entity34 believes the star also sheds mass , so much so that it no longer has the density to become a black hole			1
before the black hole can form , she said , the dying star swells and explodes			2
the singularity as predicted never forms , and neither does the event horizon - the boundary of the black hole where not even light can escape			0
‘ i ’m still not over the shock , ’ said professor @entity34			2
‘ we ’ve been studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution gives us a lot to think about			0
’ experimental evidence may one day provide physical proof as to whether or not black holes exist in the universe			1
but for now , @entity34 says the mathematics are conclusive			0
what ’s more , the research could apparently even call into question the veracity of the @entity96			0
most physicists think the universe originated from a singularity that began expanding with the @entity100 about 13.8 billion years ago			0
if it is impossible for singularities to exist , however , as partially predicted by @entity104 , then that theory would also be brought into question			0
during the collapse process stars release a type of radiation called @entity108 ( shown )			1
but professor @entity34 claims this process means the star loses too much mass and ca n't form a black hole			1
and this also apparently means the @entity96 , that the universe began as a singularity , may not be correct earlier this year professor @entity42 shocked physicists by saying ' there are no black holes '			1
in a paper published online , professor @entity42 instead argues there are ' grey holes ' ' the absence of event horizons means that there are no black holes - in the sense of regimes from which light ca n't escape to infinity , ' he says in the paper , called @entity131 and @entity132			1
he says that the idea of an event horizon , from which light can not escape , is flawed			0
he suggests that instead light rays attempting to rush away from the black hole ’s core will be held as though stuck on a treadmill and that they can slowly shrink by spewing out radiation			0
one of the reasons black holes are so bizarre is that they pit two fundamental theories of the universe against each other			0
namely , @entity56 ’s theory of gravity predicts the formation of black holes			2
but a fundamental law of quantum theory states that no information from the universe can ever disappear			0
efforts to combine these two theories proved problematic , and has become known as the black hole information paradox - how can matter permanently disappear in a black hole as predicted ? professor @entity34 ’s new theory does manage to mathematically combine the two fundamental theories , but with unwanted effects for people expecting black holes to exist			1
‘ physicists have been trying to merge these two theories - @entity56 ’s theory of gravity and quantum mechanics - for decades , but this scenario brings these two theories together , into harmony , ’ said professor @entity34			2
‘ and that ’s a big deal			0

scientist claims she has mathematical proof black holes can not exist
she said it is impossible for stars to collapse and form a singularity
professor @entity34 said she is still in ' shock ' from the find
previously , scientists thought stars much larger than the sun collapsed under their own gravity and formed black holes when they died
during this process they release a type of radiation called @entity42 radiation
but new research claims the star would lose too much mass and would n't be able to form a black hole
if true , the theory that the universe began as a singularity , followed by the @entity100 , could also be *wrong*
