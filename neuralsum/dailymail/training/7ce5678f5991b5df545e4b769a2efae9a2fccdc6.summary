by @entity0 published : 20:14 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 04:41 est , 23 july 2013 a study that says membership of the @entity3 is beneficial for @entity4 was last night branded a ‘ @entity6 whitewash ’			1
despite uncovering a catalogue of problems , the @entity8 review found that the balance of power between @entity12 and @entity13 was ‘ broadly appropriate ’			0
the report sparked anger among @entity17 backbenchers , who questioned why it was commissioned in the first place since the conclusions appear to contradict @entity22 ’s policy of renegotiating @entity4 ’s relationship with @entity12			1
foreign secretary @entity24 : mandarins at the @entity8 has concluded little needs to change in @entity4 's relationship with @entity28 the review warned that : but despite these issues , mandarins at the traditionally europhile @entity8 concluded that little needed to change in @entity4 ’s relationship with @entity12			1
six reports published by foreign secretary @entity24 yesterday are the first tranche of 36 studies on different aspects of @entity4 ’s interactions with the @entity3			1
a report on the @entity28 single market showcased the views of big business and concluded : ‘ integration has brought to the @entity3 , and hence to the @entity4 , in most if not all observers ’ opinions , appreciable economic benefits			1
@entity46 : ' this sounds like a @entity6 whitewash			0
this is a government review , not a @entity17 review			2
' ‘ but it has brought with it a regulatory framework which some find difficult to operate within or find burdensome			0
‘ is that trade - off , between cost and benefit , between economics and politics , of overall benefit to the @entity4 ? most observers , and indeed most of the evidence received for this report , answer positively			0
’ the report on health detailed concerns about the way the 48 - hour working week restricts training for junior doctors and encourages foreigners to come to the @entity4 for treatment on the @entity72			1
but it concludes : ‘ the current balance of competence between the @entity3 and the @entity4 was considered by stakeholders to be broadly appropriate			1
’ a report on animal health and food safety detailed concerns that harmonisation of rules on pets travelling has ‘ significantly heightened the risk of rabies returning to the @entity4 ’			1
a report on international aid found that the ‘ @entity3 development programme management and delivery are overly complex and inefficient , and the @entity3 does not systematically measure the results that @entity3 aid achieves ’			1
yet it concluded that ‘ the advantages of working through the @entity3 outweigh the disadvantages ’			2
@entity17 mp @entity46 said the report should prompt the @entity96 to abandon the @entity97 and seek to repatriate powers alone			0
he said : ‘ this sounds like a @entity6 whitewash			0
this is a government review , not a @entity17 review			2
this exercise was an irrelevance			0
’ fellow @entity17 @entity105 said : ‘ it is the same tired old actors regurgitating the same tired old script			0
‘ it is sir @entity110 assisted by big corporate interests looking out to the world from their desks in @entity6			0
‘ we need a referendum so 60 million people , not just @entity110 , can have the final say			0
’ a total of 44,000 out of @entity4 ¿ s 144,000 doctors were trained in other @entity28 countries one in three doctors working in @entity4 qualified abroad , prompting top medical groups to express concerns about how this could harm patient safety , the review found			1
the report , which focused on the balance of power between @entity4 and the @entity3 on health issues , revealed 44,000 out of @entity4 ’s 144,000 doctors were trained in other @entity28 countries			1
it also said out of 104,000 @entity4 medical staff who are not doctors , around 34,000 hailed from other @entity3 nations			2
more than 9,000 @entity137 trained in @entity28 compared with 30,000 who qualified in @entity4 – meaning one in four learnt to practice medicine abroad			0
and evidence given to the report by @entity143 showed that more than half of @entity4 ’s nurses came from other countries within the @entity3			1
despite the alarming figures , the report concluded that continuing to ‘ import ’ doctors and other medical staff from countries around the @entity3 would only improve the quality of the health service			2
the report claims : ‘ none of the responses suggested that the current balance of competence was wrong			0
respondents recognised the benefit to the @entity4 as a net importer of health professionals			0
’ but they admitted some of @entity4 ’s leading medical groups have come forward to deliver warnings about possible safety issues			1
in evidence submitted to the review , several groups stressed that more needs to be done to ensure foreign doctors have the qualifications and language skills to work in the @entity4			2
the report said that ‘ concerns were raised ’ by the @entity177 , the @entity178 , the @entity179 , the @entity180 on @entity28 and the @entity181 , among others , on ‘ matters that impact on patient safety – namely medical training and language testing ’ .			0

government study finds membership of the @entity3 is a good thing
@entity24 says reports will *inform* debate on staying in the @entity3
@entity197 leader @entity196 dismisses it as a ' *futile* and *cynical* pr exercise '
*furious* @entity17 backbenchers question why review was commissioned
@entity72 *hospitals* are becoming *over-run* with foreign patients
more than *£* *1.2billion* of @entity4 ’s aid cash is spent in an ‘ inefficient ’ manner by the @entity3
rabies could be heading for @entity4 shores
@entity3 red tape is ‘ burdensome ’ for business
@entity3 working time rules mean junior doctors are not trained properly
