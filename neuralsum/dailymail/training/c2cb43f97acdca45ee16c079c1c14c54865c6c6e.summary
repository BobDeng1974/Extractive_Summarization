@entity0 was so enraged after being told @entity1 would not let him leave in the summer that he considered boycotting training and matches			1
the midfielder felt hurt and cheated that he was promised an exit if the club sold their stars then when the mass exodus of their top players began he was forced to stay			0
when @entity0 left a meeting with @entity1 's board on july 29 , flanked by his two agents @entity13 and @entity14 , he was furious and exploded on social media , tweeting : ' six years of an amazing journey destroyed in one hour ! ' @entity0 ( centre ) is challenged by @entity19 's @entity18 at @entity20 on sunday @entity1 midfielder @entity0 ( right ) battles for the ball with @entity18 during the @entity24 clash it was either that or hurling a tear gas grenade back into the room , he joked afterwards when calm had restored			1
but keeping hold of the @entity31 has been the shrewdest piece of business – amongst many – that @entity1 manager @entity34 , chairman @entity35 and the rest of the club 's board made in the summer			1
and even the player himself			0
speaking on @entity42 after their historic win against @entity19 at @entity20 on sunday , @entity41 said : ' i think he could play at any of the top clubs in the league , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity19 or @entity49 – he 's showed his quality this season			1
‘ you look at @entity0 and @entity53 today , there was no sweat on them			0
they 're composed and organised			0
' @entity0 jumps above @entity19 striker @entity58 ( front ) to head the ball @entity0 ( right ) plays for @entity1 in a @entity62 match against @entity63 in august 2009 at the time of that july meeting , @entity64 were in pole position to sign him			1
@entity0 's agents had tried to ease the transition away from the club by informing them in february last year that he was interested in moving on , after almost six years of service since his £ 1.2million move from @entity73 in june 2008			2
then in the summer , in the space of two months , @entity75 left for @entity77 , @entity74 went to @entity19 , then @entity78 and @entity79 followed to @entity80			2
@entity81 moved to @entity49 the day before the meeting			0
@entity64 were pursuing @entity0 ; he desperately wanted to move there and assumed the deal would be finalised			0
but that door was slammed in his face			0
@entity78 ( right ) celebrates scoring for @entity77 against @entity87 last month as @entity75 looks on @entity81 ( left ) in action for @entity49 at @entity89 's earlier this month , while @entity19 's @entity74 ( right ) advances with the ball against @entity1 on sunday in truth , the 25 - year - old was often overshadowed by those others in @entity1 's rise from @entity95 , then the @entity96 – when he signed – and up the @entity24 table			1
but @entity34 has built a team around him ; adding @entity100 's dangerous creativity , @entity102 's physical presence and finishing , a solid foundation behind of @entity104 alongside @entity53 , who has excelled this campaign , and @entity106 in goal			2
the list could go on of @entity1 players who have shone this season , with @entity0 so often co-ordinating their sharp , incisive attacking football from the middle while nullifying opponents in defence			2
@entity100 takes his shirt off as he celebrates his winner for @entity1 against @entity19 @entity100 ( right ) shoots and @entity117 ( left ) fails to stop the shot as @entity1 take the lead @entity1 players celebrate with manager @entity34 ( right ) after the big win at @entity20 @entity0 was informed that he was part of @entity34 's project when he was refused to leave			1
it turns out his role was integral			0
@entity41 nailed it during his analysis and @entity0 's options are widening , with @entity49 , @entity19 and @entity77 all coveting the player			1
he has come a long way from the 18 - year - old who initially struggled to settle in @entity133 , with few @entity31 speakers in the team at the time , and even further from the teenager who would watch the @entity24 on television with his team - mates – particularly @entity77 and @entity140 his favoured team and player – at @entity73 's academy			1
now he considers @entity133 his second home			0
with @entity1 soaring in third , his home could well remain on the south coast for the foreseeable future .			0

@entity0 wanted to leave @entity1 in the summer
the @entity31 exploded on social media when told he could not leave
@entity41 believes @entity0 could play for any @entity24 club
@entity34 has built a team around @entity0
