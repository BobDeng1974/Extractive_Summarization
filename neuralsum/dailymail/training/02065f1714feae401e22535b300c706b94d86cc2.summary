@entity0 is the second most powerful hurricane in modern history , with its might exceeding even that of @entity6 , according to a measurement of the hurricane 's strength in relation to its size			1
researchers have found that @entity0 's @entity14 index , or @entity14 , which quantifies the power of a hurricane based on how far out tropical - storm force winds extend from the center , ranked second only to @entity19 in 2003			2
@entity0 's ike was 140 @entity20 , which was about 20 @entity20 higher than @entity6 's , according to @entity21 , a senior researcher at the @entity23 's @entity22 of @entity24 and @entity25			2
' at any given moment , many hurricanes contain more energy than an atomic bomb in their surface winds alone ( even excluding winds at higher elevations and latent heat energy ) , ' he added			0
the category levels that are more widely cited to quantify the power of hurricanes purely measure wind speed			0
@entity6 was measured as a category 3 hurricane at landfall and later rose to a category 5			2
the estimated cost of @entity0 is $ 20 billion residents walk past burned houses in @entity69 , a neighborhood located in the @entity71 borough of @entity72 , after it was devastated by @entity0 @entity0 , meanwhile , was measured as a category 1 hurricane at landfall			1
but @entity0 may end up being the second costliest hurricane in history after @entity6 because of its high @entity14 , @entity21 noted			1
' @entity0 had category 1 winds at landfall yet was able to create very significant storm surge over hundreds of miles of highly populated coastline , ' he wrote			1
general view of downtown @entity83 , @entity84 after @entity6 hit in 2005 ' @entity6 's ike was more concentrated , @entity0 's ike was more spread out			0
this metric -- more than wind speed -- encapsulates the respective storms ' horrific effects			0
' @entity0 has been estimated to cost at least $ 20 billion in damage , whereas @entity6 cost roughly $ 106 billion .			0

@entity0 was more powerful than @entity47 atomic bomb
the storm exceeded @entity6 given the strength related to its size ratio
@entity0 may become the second costliest hurricane behind @entity6
despite being only category 1 at landfall @entity0 generated significant storm surge over hundreds of miles
