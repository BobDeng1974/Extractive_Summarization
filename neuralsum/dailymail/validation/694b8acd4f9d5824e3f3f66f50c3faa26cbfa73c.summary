whether it is tasty beef or succulent chicken , only the best will do for our beloved pets			2
but many dog and cat foods are not all they seem			0
research by vets has shown many popular tinned foods contain high quantities of meat not on the label			1
one beef stew dog food was found to be predominantly chicken			0
of the 17 pet foods subjected to dna testing at @entity17 , 14 contained meats that were not spelled out on the can			1
as good as it looks ? 63 per cent of meat detected in @entity23 as it looks @entity24 ‘ with beef ’ was chicken and 22 per cent was pork			1
only 15 per cent was beef researcher @entity29 , a fellow of the @entity30 , said misleading labelling could put dogs and cats at risk of serious allergic reactions			0
latest figures show @entity37 spend £ 1billion a year on more than 400,000 tons of tinned pet food			0
more than three quarters of the nation ’s eight million cats and almost half of the nine million dogs eat canned food			0
professor @entity29 tested ten popular dog foods and seven types of cat food for dna of cows , pigs , chickens and horses			2
none of the tins had horsemeat in them , but most contained beef , pork or chicken despite it not being mentioned on the label			1
some of the ‘ beef ’ foods actually contained more pork or chicken			1
for instance , 63 per cent of meat detected in @entity23 as it looks @entity24 ‘ with beef ’ was chicken and 22 per cent was pork			1
only 15 per cent was beef			0
not all brands were criticised – all of @entity72 ’s chicken breast cat food was determined to be the meat labelled @entity74 labelled as being ‘ with beef ’ had far more chicken and pork than beef , and 81 per cent of the meat detected in @entity81 cat food was chicken or pork – despite it being the ‘ beef ’ version			1
but not all brands were criticised – all of @entity72 ’s chicken breast cat food was determined to be the meat labelled			2
professor @entity29 said the research suggested ‘ a considerable mismatch in the labelling standard of the pet food industry and what the purchaser would reasonably expect ’			1
he added : ‘ in a human situation , this would be completely unacceptable			0
if i was to buy a tin of ham , i would n’t want to be eating rabbit as well			0
’ the foods complied with the law , which allows the phrase ‘ with beef ’ , even if beef is not the main meat			1
but writing in journal @entity109 , professor @entity29 called on manufacturers to make labels clearer , allowing ‘ more informed choices … particularly important for pets with food allergies , reduce the risk of product misinterpretation … and avoid potential religious concerns ’			2
@entity116 ’s @entity115 said pet food makers follow guidance laid down by the @entity119 , adding : ‘ it may be beneficial for these guidelines to be amended so the information is clearer … to allow people to make a more informed choice			0
’ the @entity124 said makers may use meat from different animals as supply levels fluctuate but the nutritional quality does not vary .			0
