by @entity0 published : 19:08 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 9 april 2013 the name says it all : for more than 70 years the soldiers of @entity5 ’s @entity4 have been prepared to risk their all by dropping into the toughest of war zones			1
but now cost cutting means the @entity4 will no longer be trained to use their chutes , the @entity10 can reveal			2
the regiment , whose most famous sortie during the @entity14 was immortalised in the film @entity15 , has been targeted by @entity17 accountants keen to reduce budgets			0
@entity19 : paratroopers shown here dropping from a @entity21 will no longer be trained to use their chutes due to @entity17 cost cutting measures until now , all recruits joining the 1,500 - strong regiment have undergone intensive parachute training , including a requirement to complete eight jumps before being considered ready for battle			1
soldiers have had to do at least two refresher jumps each year of their service to ensure that they remain fully trained for drops behind enemy lines			2
now , just a handful of recruits will receive parachute training and hundreds of more experienced @entity20 will not do the annual jumps required to keep them battle - ready			1
revealed : former @entity4 officer @entity38 , now a @entity40 mp , said that parachuting is being phased out former @entity4 officer @entity38 , now a @entity40 mp , revealed that parachuting is being phased out and in future most recruits will not see a chute or receive specialist airborne training			1
@entity38 , who led paratroops in battles against the @entity49 in @entity50 in 2007 to 2008 , said : ‘ our paratroopers in the second and third battalions , 2 @entity51 , can not jump any more because they are being denied training and resources			1
' every year there used to be huge parachuting exercises with around 800 paratroopers jumping together			0
' now only 80 troops are jumping in these exercises			0
parachute training is being phased out to nothing			2
’ senior military figures condemned the reduction in parachute training , arguing that recent operations by @entity68 and @entity70 forces have proved the value of paratroops			0
on january 29 this year , 200 @entity68 paratroopers were dropped over the war - torn @entity75 state of @entity77			0
they landed at night , forcing @entity79 rebels to relinquish control of @entity81			0
and last year @entity70 troops launched several missions into isolated areas of @entity50 by parachute to avoid @entity49 forces who were ready to ambush any soldiers travelling by road			1
former chief of the general staff general sir @entity90 said : ‘ parachuting should remain an essential capability in @entity5 ’s defence because dropping troops from fixed wing aircraft gives you strategic options beyond that which can be achieved by helicopter			0
paratroopers can operate effectively at night and can surprise enemy on the ground			0
’ lieutenant general sir @entity104 , who commanded @entity51 in the @entity105 added : ‘ for as long as the government states that it wishes to retain a parachute capability they should bloody well pay for it			0
celebrated : the @entity4 's most famous sortie during the @entity14 was immortalised in the film ' @entity15 ' starring @entity111 ' stopping recruits from completing their parachute training is completely unacceptable			1
’ @entity17 strategists point to the fact that the @entity4 has not mounted a large - scale parachute drop for more than half a century			2
the last such mission was during the @entity118			0
last night an @entity17 spokesman admitted that the @entity120 has reduced the size of the parachute force on short notice to 80 men			1
he added that parachute training had never formed part of basic training for @entity4 recruits			1
the move coincides with the phased withdrawal of the @entity132 ’s main transport aircraft , the @entity21 – used by @entity4 for their jumps .			2

@entity4 recruits will not undergo intensive training
experienced soldiers will not do annual jumps to stay battle ready
