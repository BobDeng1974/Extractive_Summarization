@entity0 has warned his defenders that they must get better if @entity2 are to mount another challenge for the @entity5 title this season			1
the free - scoring @entity7 came within two points of winning the championship last season , but conceded 46 goals along the way and the manager has identified his back - line as the main area that needs to be improved			2
' ( @entity18 ) is a place where we want to be better , there ’s no doubt about that , ' he told @entity23			0
' generally of course the whole team will be looking to improve , and there are areas that we will specifically be looking at between now and august			0
' @entity2 will be tested more this season now that they have qualified for the @entity48 , although @entity0 says their return to @entity52 's elite competition has made signing new players easier			1
@entity52 's elite : @entity48 football has attracted top players like @entity57 ' we ’re in the @entity48 , players want to come here and play and that ’s great , ' he said			1
' it is easier to attract players but you ’ve still got to do your work and convince players to come			1
' the off - season was n’t much of a holiday really ! the scouting team , myself , the directors were flying all over @entity52 to get players in			0
' the @entity76 club has confirmed the signings of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 pair @entity57 and @entity81 - with @entity0 revealing there is likely to be more to come			1
' at this level you have to be able to spend and the owners have been great , ' he added			0
' they ’ve backed us in terms of getting players in and hopefully we can get one or two more in which will give us great depth going into all the competitions			0
' ' the best players want to play at the best level			0
' @entity2 are expected to complete deals for @entity80 defender @entity96 , @entity97 forward @entity98 and @entity101 @entity100 star @entity99 before the transfer window closes			1
i 'll get my @entity104 : @entity96 is close to completing a £ 20m move from @entity80 to @entity2 more to follow : @entity98 ( @entity106 ) and @entity99 ( r ) are also expected to arrive at @entity76 imminently meanwhile , @entity0 has said that he will not rush the recovery of injured forward @entity57 after the @entity109 international suffered lateral collateral ligament damage during a training session in the @entity111			1
' of course it was very disappointing - it 's probably going to be four to six weeks , ' @entity0 said at a media conference from @entity114 in @entity115			2
' he has looked fantastic in training ; it was just a very simple exercise with no pressure			0
the medical team are looking closely at that at the moment			0
' we 're hopeful that he 'll come back fairly quickly but there 's no rush			2
he 's a fantastic player , we just need to get him back fit and well because it 's a long season			2

@entity0 admits that @entity2 's defence must to better
reds finished second in the @entity5 but conceded 49 goals last term
@entity48 return has helped attract players to @entity76
