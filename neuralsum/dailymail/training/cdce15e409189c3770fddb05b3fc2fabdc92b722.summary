by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor married people are now in a minority in @entity4 and @entity5 after millions gave up on ever tying the knot			1
new figures show that 51 per cent of people are ' not married ' for the first time , up from 47 per cent in a decade			1
it marks a dramatic shift from the 1930s when 9 in 20 people had married by the time they turned 40			0
the @entity15 said the changes were the result of declining numbers of people making it up the aisle since the 1970s and changing social attitudes towards people who co-habit or live @entity24 down for interactive map according to the 2011 census more than 15.7 million people in @entity4 and @entity5 had never been married , up from 12.5 million in 2001 , and accounting for around a third of over- 16s			1
but also taking into account those who have divorced or been widowed , there were 23 million people classed as ‘ not married ’ people , or 51 per cent			1
the figure is up from from 47 per cent in 2001 , 58 per cent in 1991 and 63 per cent in 1981			0
the @entity15 said : ‘ the rise in the single population could be the result of a number of factors , including the proportional decline in marriage since the 1970s and the increased social acceptability of remaining single or cohabiting ( either never marrying or not re-marrying following divorce or widowhood )			1
’ the proportion of people who tie the knot has been falling over several decades			0
among people born in 1930 , 90 per cent of men and 94 per cent of women had ever married by age 40			1
by contrast , of those born in 1970 , 63 per cent of men and 71 per cent of women had ever married by the same age			2
the @entity55 shows that just 20 per cent of men and 24 per cent of women aged under 40 were married			1
the @entity15 released a interactive series of maps showing where single people live , including this one which shows the percentage of those aged 16 and over who were not living as a couple in 2011 the @entity15 added : ' men and women in their late teens and twenties have seen the greatest decline in the proportions who have ever married			1
of those born in 1930 , 51 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women were married by the age of 25 compared with 5 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women born in 1986			1
' these figures reflect the increasing proportion of men and women choosing to delay marriage or not get married at all			2
' meanwhile the number of singletons has risen by 3million in a decade , as more of us choose to live on our own , according to new research			0
a detailed analysis of the state of the nation reveals that in some areas more than half of people are unattached , with @entity94 topping the league tables where almost two in three men and 57 per cent or women are single			1
but anyone looking for love in @entity101 is going to struggle , because just a quarter of men and fewer than a fifth of women are on the market			0
the @entity15 has published an interactive map showing the areas where all the single men , and women , live			1
people who live near the seaside may be more prone to divorce , a new report suggests			0
the divorce hot spots of @entity4 and @entity5 are all coastal areas , according to the @entity15			1
the local authority with the highest proportion of divorcees was @entity120 where 13.1 per cent of the population were divorced			0
in @entity123 12.8 per cent of people were divorced while 12.2 per cent of those in @entity125 had been through a marriage breakdown			2
@entity127 and @entity128 , @entity129 , the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 also made up the top 10 places with the highest proportions of divorced people			0
' the top 10 were all in coastal areas , and mainly on the @entity141 of @entity4 apart from @entity120 and @entity133 , ' the report states			0
' higher levels of divorced population may relate to the affordability of housing and living costs in some of these areas resulting in divorced people with reduced economic assets living there			0
' the single population is also ageing , in part as a result of more older people being divorced and widowed			2
in 2011 , the median age of the adult population who had never been married was 27.5 , a rise from 26.9 in 2001			0
those who were not married in 2011 had a median age of 35.6 , a rise from 35.0 in 2001			0
of those who had never been married , women were younger than men , with a median age of 26.9 compared with 28 years			2
the @entity15 said : ‘ this is linked to the trend for women to marry men who are older than @entity169 , not married women were on average older than men ( 39.3 and 32.9 years respectively )			1
this is most likely due to the higher proportion of widows in the population ( 10 per cent of adult women compared with 3.3 per cent of adult men )			2
’ @entity94 in @entity178 has the highest proportion of single men ( 63 per cent ) , followed by @entity181 ( 61 per cent ) and @entity182 ( 60 per cent )			1
in @entity187 , @entity183 and @entity184 and @entity185 59 per cent of men were classed as single			2
by contrast , just 24 per cent of men in @entity101 were single , with 27 per cent single in @entity191 , @entity101 and @entity192 in the @entity193			2
@entity94 is also the capital of single women , with 57 per cent unattached , ahead of @entity181 on 56 per cent and @entity182 55 per cent			1
in @entity183 and @entity184 , @entity195 and @entity196 , 53 per cent of women were single			2
but in @entity199 just 18 per cent of women were single , followed by @entity200 ( 20 per cent ) and several areas where only 21 per cent were single			1
‘ the majority of the top 10 local authorities with the highest proportions of those who were either never married or unmarried were in @entity178 , ’ the @entity15 said			1
‘ local authorities with high proportions of single people had younger populations			0
@entity212 , for example , appeared in the top 10 for both groups			0
‘ the area with the lowest proportion of both never married and not married was @entity199 where 21 % of the adult population had never been married and a further 18 % were divorced or widowed			1
‘ this reflects the older age structure in this area and higher proportions of the population who were widowed			0
’ while the top 10 for men and women were dominated by the same areas , in some parts of the country there were marked differences			0
in @entity200 in @entity231 there were 21 men to every 10 women who had never been married			0
in the small village of @entity236 in @entity200 , there were 97 men to every 10 women – because it has a large army barracks in the area			0
there were more women than men who were not married in coastal areas such as @entity245 ( @entity246 ) and @entity247 ( @entity248 ) where there were around 13 women who were not married to every 10 men who were not married			0
the @entity15 added : ‘ these coastal areas have an older population and as women have higher life expectancy , this is likely to be due to the number of widows in the population			2

51 % of people have never married or are divorced or widowed , up from just *37* % in 1981
more than half of women and two thirds of men in the @entity178 *borough* of @entity94 are single
in @entity199 just 18 % of women and only 24 per cent of men are unattached , according to the @entity55
in 2011 over 15.7 million adults or 35 per cent of people aged 16 and over @entity4 and @entity5 had never married
number had risen from 12.5 million ( or 30 per cent ) in 200 , @entity15 said
