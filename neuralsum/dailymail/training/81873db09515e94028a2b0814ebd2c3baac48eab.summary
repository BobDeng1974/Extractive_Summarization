by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 04:19 est , 18 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:31 est , 18 december 2013 @entity4 was today branded a ' turkey ' after it emerged he has been given nine months to save his job following a series of dismal performances			2
@entity9 is weighing up whether to sack his shadow chancellor amid internal criticism and polling evidence that he is damaging @entity14 ’s election chances			1
today in the @entity15 seized on the revelation , claiming mr @entity9 was ' sitting next to a turkey ' who was too weak to fire			1
joke : within minutes of @entity15 branding @entity4 a turkey , parody account @ @entity24 posted this image on @entity26 ridicule : @entity4 ( left ) was dismissed as a ' turkey ' by @entity15 as he clashed with @entity9 ( right ) mr @entity4 was mr @entity9 ’s third choice for @entity10 after his brother @entity29 turned him down and @entity30 quit			1
his red - faced performance in response to @entity34 's @entity33 led senior @entity14 figures to admit that their key economic message was not being well - sold			1
a shadow cabinet source said mr @entity4 had until @entity14 ’s conference next september to come up with a credible economic plan or face the sack			1
‘ @entity4 does n’t want to have to sack balls because of the disruption it will cause , but if we ’re still in difficulty on the economy by conference then he will do it , ’ the source said			1
‘ you should not underestimate how ruthless @entity4 is			2
he will not let anything stand between us and the election , and that includes @entity4			0
’ attack : mr @entity15 today dismissed @entity14 attacks on the government 's economic policy , as employment figures showed a record 30million are now in work the source acknowledged it would be ‘ difficult ’ to remove mr @entity4 because of his powerbase in @entity14 ’s @entity67 camp and the trade unions , and his wife @entity70 ’s position as shadow home secretary			2
but the source insisted that mr @entity4 would come under intense pressure to knuckle under rather than destabilise @entity14 in the run - up to the 2015 election			2
‘ yes , it would be difficult , particularly with @entity70			0
but balls could not afford to cause too much trouble nine months out from an election – the party would never forgive it			1
’ @entity15 on @entity4 at prime minister 's questions , mr @entity9 and mr @entity15 clashed over unemployment figures and the impact on family finances			1
but as mr @entity4 , sitting next to mr @entity9 , started gesticulating across the despatch box , mr @entity15 hit back : ' ah ! we have a new hand gesture from the shadow chancellor			1
' i would have thought after today 's briefing in the papers the hand gesture for the shadow chancellor should be " bye bye "			1
' you do n't need it to be @entity99 to know when you are sitting next to a turkey			0
' there has been speculation that the former chancellor @entity103 might be tempted to return after he has finished leading the campaign to keep @entity105 in the @entity106 next autumn			2
one @entity14 source said : ‘ @entity103 is an option			0
but people putting it forward forget that @entity4 ’s big picture message is that we have moved on from the last @entity14 government			0
@entity103 does n’t fit with that			0
’ other possible successors include the shadow business secretary @entity116 , the shadow work and pensions secretary @entity117 and the shadow foreign secretary @entity119			2
decision : senior @entity14 figures say leader @entity9 will have to decide whether to keep mr @entity4 in post in time for the 2015 election tipped : @entity124 business secretary @entity116 ( left ) and shadow work and pensions secretary @entity117 are seen as possible successors to mr @entity4 mr @entity4 – who wrongly predicted the @entity127 ’s economic plans would cause a triple - dip recession – has come under intense pressure in recent months as the economic recovery gathers pace			1
an opinion poll at the weekend showed that although @entity14 retains an overall lead , just 21 per cent trust the party on the economy , compared to 32 per cent supporting mr @entity34 and mr @entity15			0
senior @entity14 source senior labour figure are concerned that mr @entity4 ’s strident criticism of the government ’s deficit reduction programme will come back to haunt them if the recovery takes off			0
mr @entity4 has spent the last three years talking down the economy , predicting a triple - dip recession and the loss of one million jobs – and warning that @entity140 cuts would ‘ choke off ‘ the recovery			0
mr @entity4 sparked derision in the @entity150 earlier this month when he accused the chancellor @entity34 of being ‘ in denial ’ about the economy			0
the crimson - faced shadow chancellor stumbled on , but his performance led to fresh questions about whether he was now an electoral liability			1
one labour mp said he had ‘ f * * * ed up ’ @entity14 ’s economic policy by refusing to change course despite overwhelming evidence that the recovery is underway			0
in an angry response mr @entity4 insisted he did n’t ‘ give a t * * * ’ about criticism of his performance			0
@entity15 mocked him in the @entity150 last week , saying the pugnacious shadow chancellor ‘ can dish it out , but he ca n’t take it ’			1
ominously , mr @entity9 laughed openly at his shadow chancellor ’s discomfort when mr @entity15 suggested his career was ‘ going down ’			1
tensions between @entity14 ’s top two emerged last month when a leaked email from one of mr @entity9 ’s senior aides described mr @entity4 as a ‘ nightmare ’			2
shadow cabinet ministers are also braced for a series of bruising encounters with mr @entity4 in the @entity182 as @entity14 tries to hammer out its manifesto position on key issues like education and health reform			0
blairite figures warn that mr @entity4 is a ‘ roadblock ’ to reform , and still wants to keep an iron grip on public services from the centre , rather than devolving power and tailoring services to users .			0

@entity198 *insiders* insist @entity9 can be ' ruthless ' with whole team
balls under pressure after dismal performance at the @entity33
he turned red and lost his way while *colleagues* looked *uncomfortable*
shadow chancellor has until party conference in september to *improve*
