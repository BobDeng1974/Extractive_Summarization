by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 05:37 est , 10 may 2012 it was definitely one small step for robotkind - the @entity2 drove just 12 feet on may 8 - but it 's a sign that the robot is still going , eight years into a mission that was meant to last just three months			1
opportunity had spent 19 weeks stuck in one place to ' weather out ' the dark months of the @entity8 winter on an outcrop called @entity10			1
this week , the solar power rose enough for it to drive again			1
a view captured by @entity2 before starting its first drive of 2012			2
the @entity2 has been ' stuck ' in the same place for 19 weeks , waiting for the sun to provide enough power			1
this week , it drove 12 feet forward view from @entity2 this week : opportunity has worked through four @entity22 winters since it landed in in january 2004 about 14 miles northwest of its current location opportunity has worked through four @entity22 winters since it landed in in january 2004 about 14 miles northwest of its current @entity26 to the equator than its twin rover , @entity29 , opportunity has not needed to stay on a sun - facing slope during the previous @entity33 , however , @entity2 's solar panels carry a thicker coating of dust , and the team is using a strategy employed for three winters with @entity29 : staying on a sun - facing slope			1
since landing in the @entity43 region of @entity8 on jan. 25 , 2004 , opportunity has driven 21.4 @entity44 and its rover twin , @entity29 , completed their three - month prime missions on @entity8 in april 2004			1
both rovers continued for years of bonus , extended missions			0
both have made important discoveries about wet environments on ancient @entity8 that may have been favorable for supporting microbial life			1
spirit stopped communicating in 2010			0
opportunity knocks : the rover has been on @entity8 for nearly eight years water discovery : opportunity helped confirm that @entity8 used to be much warmer and wetter on average it lies 141.6 million miles from the @entity60 with a diameter of 4,222 miles , it ’s around half the size of the @entity64			1
it ’s absolutely freezing there , with an average temperature of @entity68 ( -65c )			0
gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours			2
the atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of @entity64 ’s pressure – and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide			0
it boasts the solar system ’s biggest mountain – @entity80 , a dead volcano with staggering proportions			2
it measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft , which is almost three times higher than @entity86			0
@entity8 has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons deimos and @entity89			1
@entity8 ’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface			1
@entity8 has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps			1
if they melted , it would cover the whole planet in water 11 - metres deep , according to @entity99			2
among its chores is studying bedrock and soil at its chosen winter site			0
while @entity2 can drive short distances from one outcrop to another , it can not venture far in the cold			2
it is a bittersweet juncture for @entity2 , which along with its twin , @entity29 , landed on opposite sides of the red planet in january 2004			0
spirit suddenly stopped communicating with @entity64 last year , shortly after it became stuck in fluffy sand			2
@entity99 diligently listened for any sign from spirit and finally gave up this past spring			0
despite @entity29 's demise , @entity2 continued to trek across the @entity8 plains and arrived at the western rim of @entity119 in august			1
the rover has wowed scientists with discoveries at the site , which includes rocks and soil unlike any it has encountered during its years roaming the planet			2
opportunity recently uncovered a mineral deposit that formed from water flowing out of volcanic rocks			0
chief scientist @entity132 of @entity133 called it the ‘ single most powerful piece of evidence ’ that @entity2 has found so far of liquid water existing on @entity8 long ago			1
the finding was presented at a meeting of the @entity140 in @entity141			0
with a little over 21 miles on the clock , opportunity is showing some wear , including an arthritic shoulder , but is otherwise in good health			0
‘ it 's going on eight years , but we 're not done yet , ’ said @entity147 , the mission deputy scientist from @entity148 in @entity149			2
exploring : this picture show 's @entity2 's arm in the extended position			0
the wheels of the rover can be seen in the foreground happy landing : this image shows where the rover 's airbags left impressions in the martian soil			0
the drag marks were made after were retracted that is eight years as measured in @entity64 time			0
a @entity8 year is equivalent to 687 @entity64 days , or nearly two @entity64 years			1
opportunity will soon get some company on the surface			0
@entity99 launched its latest spacecraft to @entity8 last month , a mega-rover named @entity172 that 's set to land next summer			1
the £ 1.6billion mission will study a mountain inside a crater to determine whether the environment was conducive for microbial life			0
@entity179 : opportunity has covered an impressive 21 miles on the @entity8 surface rock on : the @entity8 rover 's microscopic imager found these intriguing round pebbles			1

rover has ' wintered ' in the same spot for 19 weeks
