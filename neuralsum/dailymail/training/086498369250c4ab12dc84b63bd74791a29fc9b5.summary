by @entity0 published : 07:56 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 13 september 2013 with almost 100 million members , it is not stretching the truth to say that @entity4 is not the average dating website			1
set up by @entity9 based @entity8 entrepreneur @entity7 , the 10 - year - old site is the biggest in @entity8 and dwarfs @entity11 sites such as @entity12 , which is estimated to have just 15 million singles on its books			1
now @entity7 , 37 , has revealed the secrets of @entity4 's phenomenal success in an interview with the @entity19 - but claims that @entity8 is sitting on a singledom time bomb			1
success story : @entity9 entrepreneur @entity7 posing with photos of couples who met via the site ' i feel that in the future if more than 20 million men can not find a wife this could bring serious social problems , ' she told @entity19 reporter @entity33			1
' we hear on the news about more single men visiting prostitutes for example			0
everyone needs a mate - a life partner - this is a very basic need for every human being			0
' thanks to @entity8 's infamous one - child policy , official figures show that by 2020 , the country will have more than 24 million men unable to find a wife			1
and it is n't just @entity8 men who are having trouble finding a partner			1
census figures show that one in five women between 25 and 29 are unmarried - a phenomenon that @entity8 commentators have dubbed ' sheng nu ' or ' leftover ' women			2
according to experts , the problem is caused by the @entity8 preference for men to marry down - both in age and status			1
gargantuan : @entity4 has a staggering 100 million users and is the biggest dating site in @entity8 marriage : @entity7 set the site up at the age of 27 and met her scientist husband via his @entity73 profile as a result , @entity74 , a 29 - year - old @entity8 journalist and researcher , told the @entity19 , there is a pool of ' @entity80 ' women with high intelligence and social value for whom getting married just is n't happening			1
this is where @entity4 steps in			2
@entity7 , who met her own husband , a scientist studying fruit flies , on the site , says most of their users are looking for lifetime partners			1
' our users are looking for life partners , not a bit of fun , ' she revealed , adding that the site steps into the gap left by traditional village matchmakers or ' @entity101 '			0
' for migrants from the countryside like me , it is next to impossible to rely on the old social networks to find a husband , ' she explains			0
' when i got to @entity9 i had no friends or family there			2
' and finding the right person alone , she adds , is n't easy			0
' there is an information asymmetry - the person you are looking for does exist but you do n't know where to find them			0
' on the other hand , because you are aiming for such an ideal partner , the person who does have the qualities you are looking for might not love you back in reality			0
' so what advice does she give lonely hearts ? in an earlier interview with @entity124 , @entity7 had this tip for women : ' do n't passively wait to be contacted			2
taking the initiative by sending potential mates messages shows you are serious about finding love			0
in a country like @entity8 with typically shy women , you will immediately stand out			2
' booming : @entity7 's successful site signs up new users every second and has been floated on the stock market while , for men , @entity8 's number one matchmaker recommended the following : ' in your initial message , make a specific reference to what you find attractive or interesting about the woman you are contacting			1
' when she is browsing messages , yours will immediately stick out , and compliments make a great conversation starter			0
' and with 4.5 million marriages already under her belt and new users signing up to her website every second of every day , @entity7 is one romantic mentor worth paying attention to			1
according to the most recent census figures , one in five @entity8 women between 25 and 29 are unmarried			0
dubbed ' sheng nu ' or ' leftover women ' in the @entity8 media , is currently causing a real headache for the government because most are what journalist @entity74 describes as ' @entity80 ' women			0
' there is an opinion that @entity165 guys will find b - quality women , b - quality guys will find c - quality women , and c - quality men will find d - quality women , ' she told the @entity19			1
' the people left are @entity165 women and d - quality men			0
so if you are a leftover woman , you are a-quality			0
' nevertheless , according to the @entity173 undertaken by the @entity8 government in 2010 , just one per cent of men thought it was acceptable for women to marry between the ages of 31 and 35 , with the overwhelming majority - 60 per cent - saying a woman should marry before the age of 27 .			2

@entity7 , 37 , is the @entity9 entrepreneur behind @entity4
the site currently has almost 100 million *singletons* on its books
@entity7 has told the @entity19 that @entity8 is headed for serious social problems
the reason for the issue is the growing number of singles , particularly men
