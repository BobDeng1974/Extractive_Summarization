should have dined - in : ' the officer explained to me that he observed me eating a burger for 2 miles , ' @entity4 said			2
' he said specifically three times , you ca n't just go down the road eating a hamburger ' both hands on the wheel ! lawyers say unless eating the burger caused an accident , there really should have been no problem with munching on a tasty burger while driving down the road ' the officer explained to me that he observed me eating a burger for 2 miles , ' @entity4 told @entity65			1
' he said specifically three times , you ca n't just go down the road eating a hamburger			0
' distraction ? @entity3 's distracted driving law is vague and the ticket will likely be tossed in court ' maybe i was enjoying the burger too much i needed to tone it down			1
