mr @entity57 added that politicians across @entity66 were in a ' vicious circle that was increasing as opposed to reducing public debt because of austerity cuts			2
under - pressure : prime minister @entity71 , shown speaking last month , is widely unpopular in @entity3 now - and his austerity plans are hated ' what we and @entity66 trade unions are proposing as a way out of the crisis is growth - that 's why we wish the best of luck to our colleagues in @entity11 in their fight			2

the under - pressure prime minister , @entity71 , has insisted the best way to tackle the crisis is with the tough austerity package which will see cuts in education , health and pay freezes			2

@entity45 , head of @entity11 , said : ' when you are on the edge of the abyss , you have to take a step backwards			0
