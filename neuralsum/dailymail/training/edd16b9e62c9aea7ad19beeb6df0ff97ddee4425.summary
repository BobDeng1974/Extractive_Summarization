by @entity0 four - times formula one world champion @entity1 fears @entity3 and @entity5 risk damaging their relationship in the heat of this year 's intense fight for the title			1
@entity5 and @entity3 have known one another since their karting days , even working as team - mates , before reuniting last year following the former 's arrival at @entity17			1
the duo have always been civil and cordial towards one another , but as time has worn on this season that has shown signs of slowly changing			0
@entity3 has been forced to settle for the runner - up spot behind his team - mate on each occasion , and it is clear that this has rankled			2
undeniably their battle for supremacy at present lacks the ferocity of @entity46 's bitterest intra-team rivalry between @entity1 and @entity47 in 1988 - 89 when the duo raced for @entity49			1
but asked by @entity50 about the @entity5 / @entity3 scrap , @entity1 smiled and said : ' they are having a nice battle at the moment			1
' it 's good for @entity46 , and with one team dominating they are letting them race , although i do n't know how long that 's going to be the case			0
' the good thing is if they continue to dominate the same way then they can let them race until the end			0
for sure , it 's a risk to their relationship			0
drving ambition : @entity5 ( front ) has a three point lead over the @entity34 in the @entity46 title race ' on the other hand , if @entity76 come back and perform better they can decide a few races before the end and say ' okay , we 're going to have a number one and a number two '			1
' that 's going to be a very complex situation because the last race is worth 50 points			0
' that is a rule i do not like , but maybe it will help the championship , you never know			0
' with @entity5 at present in the ascendancy , @entity1 has revealed he had a chat with @entity3 following the recent @entity95 @entity94			1
@entity5 won from pole , but conceded @entity3 - who finished just 0.6secs adrift after more than 300 kilometres of racing - was the better man over the course of the weekend			1
' i talked to him on sunday night , and there are a few things he can do , ' revealed @entity1			2
' first of all he understands he needs to be on pole and start the race first			0
speaking from experisnce : @entity1 ( @entity25 ) had an intense intra-team rivalry with @entity47 ( r ) in the 1980s ' there were at least two races where he was a little bit quicker than @entity5 , but you know how difficult it is with the same car , with no mistakes			1
' right now it 's very tight , and it 's going to be very tight			0
but just because @entity5 has won four times consecutively , that does n't mean things can not change			2
' the thing with @entity5 is he is using 100 per cent of his potential , and @entity3 understands he needs to do something a bit different			2
at least he knows he needs to change a few things , but we are only talking by a couple per cent			0

@entity17 *drivers* @entity5 and @entity3 risk a bust up , warns @entity1
@entity5 leads the @entity34 by three points in the @entity133 ' championships
