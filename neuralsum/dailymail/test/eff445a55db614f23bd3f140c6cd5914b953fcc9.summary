ask any @entity0 where the best place to party is and you 'll always get the same reply : ' @entity5 ! ' the city 's colourful fiestas , combining @entity9 and @entity10 traditions , often last for days			1
during the fortnight - long @entity12 celebrations , dancers parade through the streets			2
men dress as multi-coloured dragons or monsters , while local women , known as cholitas , wear skirts puffed up with petticoats and small bowler hats			2
reeds all about it : hand - crafted boats on the gentle surface of @entity26 arriving in @entity5 , you wonder at first where on earth the inhabitants get their energy			1
this city of 100,000 souls on the shores of @entity26 could leave you breathless for all the wrong reasons			1
situated on a vast plateau in the @entity38 , at an altitude north of 13,000 ft , it is higher than any @entity41 ski resort , and you need to go gently the first few days you 're here			2
hotels stock oxygen to revive tourists from soroche - altitude sickness - an affliction that causes shortness of breath , headaches and worse			2
but once acclimatised , you 're in for a treat			0
though its architecture is underwhelming ( with the exception of a splendid central square ) , what entrances every visitor to @entity5 is @entity26			1
one of the world 's largest lakes , and its highest navigable one , it stretches 110 miles by 38 miles across @entity0 and @entity59			1
it is vast , remote , unworldly			0
the high peaks of the @entity38 frame it in the distance , some glistening with snow			0
there are more familiar sights , too			0
at the town 's busy port , you 'll see a gunboat called the @entity72 , which has a distinctively @entity74 look			0
it was built in @entity76 in 1862 , then transported , piece by piece , across the @entity38 to @entity5 , where it ferried people around for 70 years until the roads made it obsolete and it was left to rot			1
it was saved from the scrapheap by an @entity86 woman , @entity85 , who restored and turned it into a @entity88			0
local life : the ingenious floating @entity90 in the middle of @entity26 are made from totora reeds the accommodation onboard is suitably nautical - you sleep in bunk beds			1
if you 're not spending the night , for a small donation you can just tour the ship			0
the port is the gateway to @entity5 's fascinating islands			1
a standard , full - day tour will first take you to the @entity90 , originally built by the uru people as a way to escape rival tribes			1
these man - made floating structures are hewn from mats of totora reeds , which grow abundantly in the shallows of the lake			1
secured to the bottom of the lake by ropes , as the layers at the bottom rot , new ones are added to the top to keep it dry and afloat			2
stepping on them feels decidedly squidgy , as if you 're treading on a giant waterbed			0
uru women greet you dressed in wide - brimmed hats and brightly - coloured skirts			2
islanders make the most of their income from tourists , so will invite you into their cosy , pointy - roofed huts , which smell of hay			2
the only hint of the 21st century ? a television in the corner			0
after the @entity134 , the next port of call is an island in the conventional sense			0
@entity140 , with its craggy , terraced hillsides dotted with sheep , is reminiscent of the @entity142			0
it 's around the same size as @entity145 in the @entity146 and home to 1,700 people			0
a glimpse of traditional @entity0 : you can meet @entity134 islanders , and go inside their homes , on the lake like @entity145 , cars are banned here , but the island 's elders also forbid beasts of burden , such as donkeys and horses , which leaves the locals to lug everything around on their backs			1
the other thing you 'll notice is that the men all wear distinctive woollen hats , reminiscent of @entity168 nightcaps			0
these denote their marital status - the tip of a bachelor 's hat is white to signify it is unfinished			2
knitting here is the preserve of men , who pass the tradition down from father to son			0
on marrying , a man may wear a totally red hat , to show that he , like his hat , is now complete			0
early evening in @entity5 and the streets are abuzz			1
@entity185 to the pedestrianised @entity186 and a restaurant called @entity188			0
here , you 'll eat some of the city 's best ceviche , the national dish of raw fish ' cooked ' by being marinated in lime juice , a trend that has caught on in the @entity74			0
being so close to the bountiful @entity26 , @entity5 has some of @entity0 's best ceviche restaurants			1
another excuse , as if you needed one , to visit this wonderful place			1
@entity199 ( www.klm.com ) flies to @entity186 , @entity0 , from £ 541 including taxes			2
@entity201 ( 020 8600 1881 , www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk ) has a 12 - day value @entity0 : @entity203 to @entity26 itinerary , visiting @entity186 , @entity205 , the @entity203 , @entity206 , @entity5 and @entity26			1
the trip costs from £ 2,290 per person based on two people sharing , all flights , transfers , @entity88 accommodation , most meals and excursions and a visit to the @entity26 islands .			1

@entity5 is not the most famous place in @entity0 - but it is one of the most fun
it sits on the west bank of the famous ( and *spectacular* ) @entity26
visitors can sail on the lake to visit the *fabled* artificial @entity90
