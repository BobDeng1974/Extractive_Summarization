who is the only @entity1 to manage five national teams ? here ’s a clue : he once scored a hat - trick in a trial match for @entity6 and played in goal for @entity8 twice			1
any closer ? the answer is @entity10 , who in may was appointed as manager of @entity12			1
he was born in @entity14 ’s @entity13 to an @entity1 - @entity16 mother and @entity18 father but his football career has taken him to more than 80 countries			1
as a player , it never quite worked out for @entity10			1
he was 16 when he played in that trial match for @entity6 and scored a hat - trick from central midfield — even though he was a striker			2
six weeks later , the knock - back letter arrived			0
@entity10 is carried by his @entity12 players after victory over @entity28 in @entity29 @entity10 is all smiles and seems to be enjoying himself as coach of @entity12 the 51 - year - old , pictured in @entity33 , has been halfway across the world in his management career @entity10 's managerial or coaching roles 1994 – 95 @entity37 ( @entity18 ) 1995 – 96 @entity38 ( @entity18 ) 1996 - 98 @entity39 ( @entity18 , youth coach ) 1998 – 99 @entity38 1999 – 2001 @entity41 2001 - 02 @entity42 ( youth coach ) 2002 – 05 @entity44 2005 - 06 @entity8 ( first - team coach ) 2007 – 08 @entity46 2009 – 10 @entity47 2010 @entity38 2010 – 12 @entity48 ( @entity18 ) 2013 - 14 @entity49 ( @entity50 , coach ) 2014 - @entity12 two years on , @entity10 , then a goalkeeper , had unsuccessful trials for @entity8			1
he relocated to @entity18 and signed for @entity39			2
he was called up to the @entity18 under 23 side but turned them down after being ordered to do national service			1
‘ i told them i ’ll wait for @entity58 , who was @entity1 manager at the time , and i ’m still waiting , ’ he jokes			2
when he was 19 he joined his brother @entity60 in @entity61 and spent a decade playing for @entity62 and @entity63 but had to give up when he snapped a ligament in his knee			0
@entity10 ’s footballing desire was undiminished so he gained his coaching badges			1
it was while he was back in @entity18 coaching that he met his wife , @entity69 , who was there on holiday			1
‘ on the first date we went to @entity74 and i told her i like my football , ’ he explains			0
‘ she asked how bad can that be ? i said if there ’s a match on telly i ’ll watch it , if there ’s a game within 1,000 miles of the house i ’ll be there and if i get offered a job anywhere in the world i feel is right i ’ll do it			2
’ mrs @entity89 could n’t complain she had n’t been warned			0
when @entity41 came calling , in 1999 , offering him his first international job and a contract worth $ 3,000 a month , @entity10 accepted			1
@entity10 ( second right ) talks to his @entity44 players during a training session in 2004 the @entity94 ( right ) watches over a training session at the @entity96 in @entity97 in 2004 hugging the crown prince of nepal at the @entity101 , which we were hosting , we met the @entity102 in the semi-final			1
i wore traditional @entity41 dress			2
we won 2 - 1 and on the lap of honour , the @entity106 had come on to the pitch and people were falling to the floor			0
he hugged me and everyone was gasping as you ’re not allowed to touch the royal family			0
70,000 @entity115 — but no noise travelling to @entity117 for an @entity119 qualifier was surreal			0
at the airport we all had to hand in our mobile phones and were n’t allowed them back until we left			0
we lost 2 - 0 in front of a 70,000 - capacity crowd but there was no noise until they scored , when they all stood up , clapped politely then sat back down again			0
10,000 at @entity130 after my first three months as @entity44 ’s manager , we travelled to @entity133 for the @entity134			1
we were 2 - 0 down after 22 minutes in the final against them , but in the 90th minute scored the winner			0
when we landed back in @entity97 , 10,000 fans greeted us			0
it took more than two hours to get from the baggage carousel to the team bus			2
his wife and first daughter , @entity144 , followed three months later , flying into unrest among @entity146 in the country			0
@entity10 called on a favour from his goalkeeper , who was also a policeman			1
they drove in an armoured truck straight on to the runway to meet @entity69 and baby @entity144 off the plane			2
as they departed , the pair were flanked by four policeman with shotguns			2
two years later , @entity10 left with the highest honour available to a foreigner , the @entity158 , awarded to him by the @entity41 royal family — and a second child , @entity162			1
he worked as assistant director at @entity42 ’s @entity164 before , within a year , the @entity44 national team asked him to take charge			1
when he arrived in @entity44 , the team did n’t have a kit sponsor , but @entity10 managed to negotiate a £ 5million deal with @entity170			1
he led them to their first international tournament win in 42 years , coming from 2 - 0 down to beat @entity133 in the final of the @entity134			0
@entity10 ’s eyes light up as he discusses a brief spell as @entity8 ’s first - team coach and the family ’s decision to move to @entity18			1
they flew over followed by 130 boxes			0
then he received a call saying he was wanted by @entity46			2
‘ i told my wife i ’d see her in three months and left before the boxes arrived , ’ he recounts			0
‘ she is a saint			0
’ he endured a frustrating year : the players were indisciplined and the national team accommodation had wooden beds with sheets that barely covered the players ’ midriffs			1
the mosquito nets were patchy — and the mosquitoes over there can kill			0
@entity10 packed his bags again , heading back to @entity18 , and within a year was in charge of @entity47			1
@entity10 receives a handshake from @entity199 legend @entity197 , then managing @entity200 , in 2004 the day he touched down in @entity201 he visited the @entity203 embassy			2
they warned him to stay off the streets because a warrant for the arrest of president @entity208 was expected and they could n’t guarantee his safety			0
he had to have a police escort to scout a left back and could only stay at the ground for 15 minutes , despite driving hours through the desert to get there			0
that job , too , lasted a year , and he returned to @entity18			1
not long ago he met @entity216 at @entity217 in @entity14			0
‘ i told him to bring @entity1 to @entity12 and play us instead of pointless friendlies , ’ @entity10 says			1
‘ the feelgood factor you will generate will be unbelievable			0
he laughed and said he did n’t even know where @entity12 is			2
i told him not to worry about that			0
’ at this point in the interview , @entity10 ’s family arrive			2
@entity144 is now 16 , @entity162 14 and @entity228 nine			0
they surround their father in the cafe in @entity33 where we meet and hear him recall working as @entity234 ’s assistant at @entity50 side @entity49 before taking the @entity12 job in the summer			1
@entity10 addresses his @entity44 players at a training camp in 2003 @entity10 , now 51 , is already growing into a hero there			1
his target is to prepare the team for when the country hosts the @entity243 in 2016 — similar to the @entity244 but a tournament only players from @entity247 clubs can participate in			1
‘ before i took over , in their last 17 games they had won once , drawn five and lost the rest , ’ he says			0
‘ i thought the only way is up			0
’ the country went mad when @entity10 led them to shock victories against @entity257 and @entity28 to reach the qualification stage for next year ’s @entity244			1
but they have since been disqualified after @entity28 complained that striker @entity260 had a passport for both @entity12 and the @entity262			1
in august , they lost an appeal against the decision			0
for @entity10 , it seems , the adventure is never over .			2

@entity10 has travelled to all four corners of the globe in an *extraordinary* coaching career
the @entity1 is currently in charge of @entity12 , his fifth national team job after @entity41 , @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity47
@entity10 has also coached at @entity42 and @entity8 , as well as clubs in @entity18 and @entity50
he managed in @entity41 during a @entity278 uprising and relied on his policeman goalkeeper for an armed escort off the plane
