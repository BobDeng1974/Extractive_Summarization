a @entity1 wedding photographer is holding a couple 's pictures hostage because they have refused to pay a fee they say was n't in their contract			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , who married in october , have not yet received their professional images from @entity13 , who says they still owe her money for a cover for their photo album			1
the couple , who paid @entity13 $ 6,000 to capture their wedding , insist their contract included a photo album but never mentioned an extra fee for the cover			1
they say they assumed a book would automatically include a cover , @entity25 reported			2
' we can pay the $ 150 , but it 's the principle , ' @entity10 , from @entity38 , told the local channel			1
' it 's not the money to us			0
it 's the principle of the fact we already paid you			2
' the contract simply says they will receive a ' 40 page 8.5x12 @entity64 with up to 80 images ' without mentioning an extra fee for the cover			2
@entity13 told @entity69 that she had told the couple about the $ 150 fee in an early meeting - but they said this did not happen			1
' it just did n't make sense , ' @entity74 said			0
' an album comes with a cover			0
it 's a component of an album			0
' memories : if the couple do not pay the fee , they can not get the photo album or cd of the photos firm : the photographer , @entity90 ( pictured ) , said the extra fee was discussed before the wedding the photographer also told them that if they fail to pay the fee by february 18 , the photos will become archived and it will cost them an extra $ 250 to access them			1
' it 's heartbreaking because these are our memories , ' mrs @entity10 added			0
' our wedding was over three months ago			0
' in a statement to @entity69 , @entity13 , who is also based in @entity38 , said : ' we make the utmost effort to consistently provide the best customer service and highest quality of photography in the industry			2
' she said she is now trying to work with the couple to resolve the issue			0

@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity38 , @entity1 , can not get their wedding photos until they pay $ 150 for an album cover
their contract included a photo album but did not mention a cover ; they had assumed a book would come with a cover
the couple , who paid photographer @entity13 $ 6,000 for the wedding , say they can *afford* the $ 150 but are refusing to pay on principle
@entity13 said she told the couple about the fee in an earlier meeting , which they deny
