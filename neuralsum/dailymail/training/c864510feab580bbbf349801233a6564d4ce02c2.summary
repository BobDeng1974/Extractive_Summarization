by @entity0 published : 02:53 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 09:54 est , 30 june 2012 @entity1 stops for no man - but it appears that horologists will force it to wait just a little on saturday			0
timekeepers will add an extra second to the last minute of june 30 to compensate for @entity8 's movements			1
the ' extra ' second is vital to keep clocks on @entity8 in sync with ' solar time ' , so that our days and nights match up to light and darkness			1
time on @entity8 is measured using atomic clocks , and has to be adjusted to keep pace with @entity8 's wobbly orbits			1
standing still : timekeepers will make a minute last 61 seconds on saturday @entity1 is manually adjusted ever so often to keep pace with the @entity8 's slightly irregular orbit - and has been since the @entity22			1
@entity23 - agreed to be the global standard time - is used to set pcs and phones around the world			0
more crucially , it also ensures gps devices can navigate accurately			0
time on @entity8 is ' counted ' by a network of 400 atomic clocks and sometimes differs from time dictated by day and night , due to fluctuations in earth 's rotation			1
atomic clocks measure time to incredibly precise accuracy by measuring vibrations caused by the decay of radioactive particles to count the seconds			1
the planet takes just over 86,400 seconds for a 360 degree revolution			0
but it wobbles on its axis and is affected by the pull of the @entity46 , @entity47 and tides meaning it gets out of step with @entity50 ( @entity50 )			0
to avoid solar time and @entity50 moving too far apart , @entity1 ( @entity1 ) is adjusted to give us the odd 86,401 - second day			0
coordinated @entity23 ( @entity1 ) has , since the @entity22 , been the agreed universal standard which dictates what time it is in every time zone on the planet			0
the speed of the @entity8 's rotation varies , however , meaning that while one rotation is one day , some days are a few milliseconds longer or shorter than others			2
scientists allow for these fluctuations by adding leap seconds roughly every year - and - a - half to keep @entity1 synchronised with our traditional , sun - based concept of time			2
they are added once the @entity70 , which monitors the planet 's activity , finds the two measurements of time have drifted apart by 0.9 seconds			0
under threat : the @entity75 wants to move to a new man - made standard of time that disregards the position of the sun in the sky , rendering sundials useless leap - second : it wo n't mean much of a lie in but saturday night will be a second longer than usual ' today , time is constructed defined and measured with atomic clocks ' said @entity87 , director of the @entity89 time - space reference system at the @entity90			1
' this allows us to ensure that everyone on @entity8 is on the exact same time			2

adjustment so @entity8 keeps pace with ' space time '
time on @entity8 is counted by atomic clocks
*slowly* gets ' out of sync ' with day and night
scientists add seconds to keep @entity8 ' in time '
