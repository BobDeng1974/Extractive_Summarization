by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:51 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 29 may 2013 deal : sgt. @entity4 ' lawyer said that he will be pleading guilty in an effort to avoid the death penalty , which the @entity7 was seeking in his case after he reportedly killed 16 @entity11 villagers in a predawn rampage in march the @entity7 staff sergeant charged with slaughtering 16 villagers during one of the worst atrocities of the @entity11 war has agreed to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty			1
staff sgt. @entity4 is scheduled to enter guilty pleas to charges of premeditated murder june 5 at @entity23 south of @entity24 , his lawyer @entity25 told @entity1 on wednesday			2
a sentencing - phase trial set for september will determine whether he is sentenced to life in prison with or life without the possibility of parole			0
the judge and commanding general must approve a plea deal			0
@entity35 previously indicated @entity36 remembered little from the night of the massacre , but he said the soldier will give a full account of what happened before the judge decides whether to accept the plea			2
in earlier interviews , @entity36 ' lawyer argues that the @entity7 was pushing the possibility of the death penalty			1
' the @entity7 is not taking responsibility for @entity36 and other soldiers that the @entity7 knowingly sends into combat situations with diagnosed ptsd , concussive head injuries and other injuries , ' @entity35 said			1
' the @entity7 is trying to take the focus off the failure of its decisions , and the failure of the war itself , and making sgt. @entity36 out to be a rogue soldier			1
' @entity36 , an @entity59 native and father of two , slipped away from his remote southern @entity11 outpost at @entity63 early on march 11 , 2012 , and attacked @entity11 compounds in two slumbering villages nearby			1
changing tales : @entity36 ' lawyer says the army should take greater responsibility for sending soldiers into combat who are suffering from ptsd and head injuries , but now he seems grateful for the plea deal most of the victims were women and children , and some of the bodies were piled and burned			1
the slayings drew such angry protests that the @entity82 temporarily halted combat operations in @entity11			2
@entity36 was serving his fourth tour in a combat zone , and the allegations against him raised questions about the toll multiple deployments were taking on @entity82 troops			2
for that reason , many legal experts believed it that it was unlikely that he would receive the death penalty , as @entity7 prosecutors were seeking			2
adding to that , the military justice system has n't executed anyone since 1961			0
the plea deal could inflame tensions in @entity11 as relatives of the victims in @entity106 became outraged at the notion @entity36 might escape the death penalty and even vowed revenge			1

' a prison sentence does n't mean anything , ' said @entity128 , whose wife and three other relatives died			0

but i will become stronger , and if he does not hang , i will have my revenge			0
' three of @entity128 's other family members were wounded , including his 7 - year - old granddaughter , who was shot in the head			0
