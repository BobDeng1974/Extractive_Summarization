@entity1 's pensions spokesman was branded ' out of touch ' today after admitting she did not know how much the state pension was worth			1
@entity4 blundered during a live radio interview , when she insisted that ' of course ' the payment was worth ' just under £ 100 - a - week '			1
when the shadow work and pensions secretary was told the true sum is actually £ 113.10 , she tried to insist it depended how long people had been working for			1
wrong - footed : shadow work and pensions secretary @entity4 was put on the spot during an interview on @entity14 with presenter @entity15 it is an occupational hazard for politicians to be put on the spot about the cost of everyday items – pints of milk , loaves of bread and the weekly shop have caught out @entity26 and @entity27 in the past			1
but voters could expect miss @entity4 to know how much pensioners will receive each week from the state , as she draws up @entity1 's reforms to how people save for retirement			1
appearing on @entity14 , live from the @entity1 conference in @entity38 , @entity36 reeves was asked how much the state pension is currently worth			1
host @entity15 said : ' how much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person ? what do they pull in a week now ? ' @entity46 ' blunder at the party conference in @entity38 today is a setback for one of @entity1 's strongest media performers miss @entity4 replied : ' it 's just under £ 100 a week , the basic state pension , of course			1
mr @entity15 asked ' is it ? ' and she again insisted ' yes '			0
but pressed again , miss @entity4 modified her answer to ' around £ 100 a week , of course ' , before mr @entity15 put her right and stated it is worth £ 113			1
' so you do n't actually know what the pension is ? ' the broadcaster declared			2
forced on to the back foot , miss @entity4 added : ' it depends how many years you 're contributed			0
' however , the gaffe was ridiculed by the government , accusing @entity1 of not being on top of the detail of pensions policy			2
@entity71 pensions minister @entity70 told @entity72 : ' sometimes when @entity1 criticised us on pensions , you wonder if they fully grasp how things work			1
' for a shadow pensions minister not to know the value of the state pension suggests it is actually the opposition who are out of touch with our pensioners			1
' embarrassingly , miss @entity4 ' error came less than 24 hours after she accused the government of overseeing an ' utter shambles '			0
in her speech to the @entity1 conference , she claimed conservative work and pensions secretary @entity90 is a man ' with his own special @entity82 - everything he touches turns to a complete and utter shambles '			1
ms @entity4 said the flagship reform universal credit was ' stuck in first gear ' , while work capability assessments were ' in meltdown ' and the youth contract was an ' embarrassing flop '			0
she said : ' it would be comical if it was n't so criminal			0
we should be angry that taxpayers ' money is being squandered			0
' that vulnerable people are being ill - treated			2
that lives are being scarred			0
that talent is being wasted			0
' we should be angry - and they should be ashamed			0
' the @entity109 will leave a truly toxic legacy			0
and for all their talk about cutting welfare , they 've overspent on social security by £ 13 billion in this @entity115 with a rising in - work benefits bill left for the next government			2
' @entity4 used her conference speech to accuse the government of an ' utter shambles ' during an interview on @entity14 , breakfast show host @entity15 asked what seemed like an easy question for @entity4 , the shadow work and pensions secretary			2
but her answer suggested she is not on top of the detail of her brief , as this transcript shows : @entity130 : how much is a pension at the moment for an elderly person ? what do they pull in a week now ? @entity136 : it ’s just under £ 100 a week , the basic state pension , of course			1
@entity130 : is it ? @entity136 : yes			0
@entity130 : the basic state pension is just under £ 100 ? @entity136 : it ’s around £ 100 a week			1
of course … @entity130 : i thought it was £ 113			0
@entity136 : it ’s around £ 100			2
if you … @entity130 : so you do n’t actually know what the pension is ? @entity136 : it depends how many years you ’re contributed			0
@entity130 : i ’m told the pension figure is £ 113.10 , do you recognise that figure ? @entity136 : it does depend , @entity15 , on how many years … @entity130 : well you ’ve just said it ’s under £ 100			1
it ca n’t be under £ 100			2
@entity136 : well it depends on how many years you ’ve contributed .			0
