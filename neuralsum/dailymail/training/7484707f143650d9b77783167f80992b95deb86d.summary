@entity1 striker @entity0 took the @entity2 by the scruff of the neck last night with two brilliantly executed goals in his side 's win over @entity8			1
fans of @entity11 giants @entity10 have become accustomed to such excellence and here sportsmail give you the lowdown on the @entity17 's super striker			2
looking up : @entity17 striker @entity0 has excelled at this @entity2 for the @entity19 i 'm sure i 've heard his name before ? definitely , if you have n't then you 've been living under a rock for the past couple of years			2
@entity0 has been prolific in the @entity11 @entity24 for @entity10 , scoring 60 goals in 89 starts for the club since arriving from @entity30 club @entity28			1
prolific : @entity0 has scored 60 goals in 89 appearances for @entity10 since arriving from @entity30 side @entity28 so is he just a two season wonder ? most certainly not			1
he carved himself a burgeoning reputation in @entity19 , first with @entity17 side @entity35 before moving to @entity28 where he spent three seasons scoring 36 goals which alerted @entity10 to his talents			1
@entity40 : @entity0 scores his side 's third goal in their 3 - 0 victory over @entity8 in @entity2 @entity44 so how did his move to @entity10 come about ? then @entity10 manager @entity46 had seen enough to splash out £ 6.5million on @entity0 - quite a sum for a player who was largely unknown in @entity50 football during the time			1
but @entity46 's faith paid instant dividends as the @entity17 scored on his debut as @entity10 beat @entity55 in the @entity56			0
and @entity0 has n't stopped scoring since			0
his performances during his first season in @entity11 earned him the nickname ' @entity0 '			0
adored : @entity10 signed the striker for £ 6.5m in 2012 and he has since been dubbed ' @entity0 ' surely @entity10 will struggle to keep him ? it will be difficult , yes			1
@entity62 's big guns are circling round the striker after his glowing performances			0
@entity65 were interested in january and continue to monitor his progress			0
but @entity68 is n't the only interested party			0
@entity70 have identified @entity0 as a potential replacement for @entity73 - bound @entity72			0
@entity73 and @entity74 have also been linked with moves for the 27 - year - old			0
not camera shy : @entity0 celebrates his third for @entity1 , who have a 100 per cent record so far how much will he cost ? he has a £ 33.2m release clause			1
well should n't a move for him for @entity0 be straight forward then ? in essence , yes			0
but the size of the release clause is the main stumbling block , it certainly was with @entity65 last season			2
while his goalscoring record in @entity11 is n't to be sniffed it , the fear is whether he would be able to carry that form into the @entity93			0
and at £ 33.2m , that 's a big gamble to take			2
finish : @entity0 grabs @entity1 's second in the 3 - 0 win over @entity8 and is much sought after could @entity65 renew their interest this summer ? his two goals against @entity8 on tuesday night wo n't have been missed by @entity68 , who is in @entity99 working for @entity101 tv			1
with @entity102 set to sign a new deal at @entity104 and complexities over @entity65 's interest in @entity107 , @entity0 could yet find himself at the @entity109 next season			2
interested : @entity65 manager @entity68 is an admirer of @entity0 but may not meet the asking price pricey : although he is much sought - after , @entity0 's £ 33.2m buyout clause may put off suitors			1

the striker scored twice for @entity1 in 3 - 0 @entity44 win over @entity8
@entity0 signed for @entity10 for £ 6.5m in 2012 from @entity30 side @entity28
he has scored 60 goals in 89 starts for @entity10 since 2012
the striker has a £ 33.2m release clause in his contract
@entity65 boss @entity68 is an admirer but may not match that *fee*
