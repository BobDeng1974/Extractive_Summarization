by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 25 july 2013 marketing experts have found people who write negative reviews on websites are often a retailer 's most valuable and loyal customers people who write negative reviews on websites are often a retailer 's most valuable and loyal customers , @entity9 research suggests			1
retail specialists at @entity11 and @entity12 found the harshest of critics may not have brought the product they were complaining about , but had strong feelings about a service or brand			1
the study , which is the first to take an in - depth look at the behaviour of customers who write negative reviews online , has disproved popular theories that peeved competitors or oddball customers make the harshest critics			1
professor @entity28 of @entity12 and professor @entity29 of @entity11 , examined over 325,000 online reviews written by customers of a large clothing company and examined more than 7,219 book reviews on @entity34 to produce their study , @entity27 reported			2
they used data collected by the websites that made it possible to match reviews to purchases made			0
the experts concluded that a firm 's most loyal customers are also their most negative reviewers , or to quote a @entity45 maxim , ' your best friends are also your harshest critics			2
' professor @entity28 said that no - one had previously looked at the behaviour of individual reviewers before and when they told the clothing company they were receiving negative reviews from their best customers , they were shocked			0
they also revealed that the harshest critics had not bought the product they were complaining about and around five per cent of product reviews were written by people who had not bought the item they disliked so much			1
the researchers found that these reviews were also on average much more negative than the 95 per cent of genuine reviews by customers who had purchased a product			2
after much hypothesising , the marketing experts concluded that reviewers were acting like ' self - appointed brand managers ' who like the company and continue buying from it despite penning a venomous review			0
retail specialists at @entity11 and @entity12 found the harshest of critics had often not brought the product they were complaining about but had strong feelings about a service or brand and were trying something new they found that critics were often complaining about a new product that is slightly different from a company 's core offering and want to tell a company if they suspect it is making a bad decision			1
professor @entity29 believes that customers feel the need to lie about buying a product to review it as they are looking for credibility			0
he told @entity27 that many people underestimate the importance of their reviews , which can have a harmful effect on a company 's sales			0
he thinks the findings of the research might prompt companies to insist that reviewers have bought a specific product first before giving their opinion on it .			0

@entity9 study is first to assess behaviour of customers who write bad reviews
the harshest critics may not have bought the product they were complaining about , but had strong feelings about a service or brand
researchers say their findings disprove the theory that peeved competitors or oddball customers make the harshest critics
