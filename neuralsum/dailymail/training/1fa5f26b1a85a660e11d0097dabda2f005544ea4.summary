@entity1 coach @entity0 has inadvertently created a storm of debate in rugby - mad @entity1 after declaring that winger @entity5 is ' probably better ' than former great @entity6			1
the 24 - year - old @entity5 has previously tried to play down such comparisons , but @entity0 's comments before the @entity10 clash with @entity11 on saturday have reignited the debate			1
@entity6 , who burst onto the scene at the 1995 @entity14 and arguably became rugby 's first globally recognised player , was considered a freak because of his size and speed that created problems for opposition wingers			2
@entity0 created a storm in @entity1 by claiming @entity5 is better than @entity6 @entity5 is marginally shorter -- he stands 1.92m tall to @entity6 's 1.96m -- and lighter ( 107kg to 119kg ) , but it is the way in which they challenge defences and score tries that has been seen as the biggest similarity			1
@entity5 's strike rate , 27 tries in 27 tests is among the best in the world , while @entity6 scored 37 tries in 63 tests			1
@entity6 had scored 16 tries in his first 27 tests			2
neither have scored a try against @entity11			2
@entity0 , however , felt that @entity5 has a wider skill set than the barnstorming @entity6 , who was afflicted with a kidney disease that greatly affected his career and forced him into a premature retirement			1
@entity5 , pictured in action against @entity45 in @entity46 , has scored 27 tries in 27 tests for @entity1 ' i think he 's probably better ( than @entity6 ) ' @entity0 told reporters in @entity11 ahead of the match at @entity52 's @entity51			1
' he can do more things than @entity6			2
' @entity6 was a great player , but i think @entity5 has got more to his game to be honest and that 's saying something			2
' he 's very good going back , under the high ball , with the ball on the ground , as well as being a greater carrier so i think he 's right up there			0
' @entity1 's @entity63 on sunday rugby reporter @entity64 agreed with @entity0 's assessment on friday , listing several reasons why @entity5 was a better player than @entity6 , mostly relating to his workrate and defensive capabilities			1
@entity6 in action at the @entity70 against @entity71 in @entity11 ' @entity5 has more game than @entity6			1
as devastating as @entity6 was with the ball in hand , he did carry a liability factor on defence where he was n't the quickest on the turn , ' @entity64 wrote			0
' @entity5 is a brutal head - on defender , he lines men up and smacks them down			0
he knows when to come off his wing looking to shut down attacks and he 's agile enough to ensure he does n't get beaten on the outside			0
' @entity5 was prone to being a little lazy earlier in his career			0
he 's good at getting off his wing and looking for work and injecting himself into the game			0
' @entity6 was good at that , too , especially at blasting into the midfield			0
but he was n't as good or as eager to track back on defence and help out the other wing and fullback			0
' not in the way @entity5 does			0
