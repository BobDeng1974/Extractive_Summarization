@entity0 , mp for @entity1 , said countries in receipt of @entity5 aid should be forced to improve their prisons @entity5 aid should be spent building prisons in developing countries so more foreign criminals can be deported , mps have heard			1
foreigners held in @entity13 and @entity14 prisons can not be returned if jails in their home country do not comply with human rights legislation			1
but conservative backbenchers have called for cash from the @entity20 and the @entity21 to develop prisons overseas to ensure they do comply			1
@entity0 , mp for @entity1 , insisted @entity5 should make it conditional to certain countries that aid would only be given if they accepted a prison building programme in order to cooperate with prisoner transfers			1
the @entity31 mp flagged up concerns about @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , which were included on what he described as a ‘ list of shame ’			0
he said they received £ 973million in @entity5 aid each year , according to 2012 figures , and had 2,900 of their nationals in @entity13 and @entity14 prisons , costing taxpayers £ 100million			0
mps were told there were 10,834 foreign nationals among a prison population of around 85,000 inmates in @entity13 and @entity14 , which cost taxpayers around £ 300 million a year			2
inmates from 160 countries were held in the jails , with @entity59 and @entity60 used solely for foreign nationals , the @entity55 debate heard			0
opening the debate , mr @entity0 said he welcomed the fact criminals were serving longer prison sentences , but said there were huge problems as 13 per cent of inmates were foreign nationals in a prison system that ‘ is basically full ’			2
he said 6,174 of the foreign prison population - around 57 % - came from 12 nations , referring to a ‘ list of shame ’ led by @entity73 and including @entity74 , @entity33 and @entity75			0
conservative @entity76 , mp for @entity77 , asked mr @entity0 : ‘ do you agree with me that one way to resolve this problem is to utilise the @entity20 and @entity21 ( @entity21 ) budgets to improve the prisons in individual countries like @entity33 ... thereby allowing prisoners to be returned to a human rights compliant jail in their actual homeland ? ’ mr @entity0 replied : ‘ i think you make an extremely sensible suggestion			1
‘ i have to say , i do n't think my constituents in @entity1 are that fussed particularly about the human rights of foreign nationals who commit crimes in this country but understand , as it stands at the moment , we operate under human rights legislation introduced by the previous government and we are not allowed in law to deport criminals to non-human right complaint prisons			2
‘ i think it does make sense to use the huge and increasing international aid budget to build suitable prisons in countries who provide us with a very large number of prisoners and i think that is a good idea			0
’ thousands of foreign criminals are locked in @entity5 prisons , but can not be deported because jails in their own countries do not meet international standards mr @entity0 , in reference to the money received by @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , added : ‘ i believe it would be a good idea to use some of that £ 973 million on building prisons in those six countries			1
’ he added : ‘ i would go so far as to say i think we should make our international aid to these countries conditional on their acceptance of a prison building programme			1
‘ i do n't think we should give these countries international aid if they are not going to cooperate with us in this regard			0
’ in his reply , mr @entity133 vowed to put ‘ whatever rocket ’ he could in other @entity137 departments to make progress on @entity33 taking its nationals back if they have committed crimes in the @entity5			0
mr @entity133 , also policing minister , said the number of foreign nationals had decreased from 11,153 to 10,843 but it was not right to say ‘ all of those would disappear ’ should measures in place be implemented , noting as foreign offenders were deported others were arrested .			0

criminals can not be deported if jails in home countries fail human rights test
@entity31 mps said foreign aid could be used to develop prisons overseas
@entity0 said aid could be conditional on prison building programme
