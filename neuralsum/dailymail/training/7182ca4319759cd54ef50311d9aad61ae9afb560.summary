education secretary @entity0 yesterday faced a growing backlash over plans to drop @entity4 literary classics from new @entity5			1
to kill a mockingbird and @entity7 are among the @entity4 novels being ditched by an exam board as well as @entity11 ’s play , @entity12 , amid government reforms			1
the @entity15 exam board said the decision was due to mr @entity0 ’s desire for the exam to be ‘ more focused on tradition ’ as well as fewer opportunities to include such texts on the new @entity21 dominated syllabus			1
however , the decision has sparked a storm of protest , with complaints trending on @entity28 and thousands of people signing online petitions to keep @entity4 classics on gcse syllabuses			1
anger : education secretary @entity0 yesterday faced a growing backlash over plans to drop @entity4 literary classics , such as @entity37 from new @entity5 authors , academics and booksellers have condemned the shake - up , with some describing it as ‘ backward - looking ’ and a traditionalist attempt to reinstate the idea of a ‘ canon ’ of @entity47 literature			1
the @entity48 has insisted that its document about content for the subject , published in december , ‘ does n’t ban any authors , books or genres ’			2
the new gcse course will include at least one play by @entity57 , at least one nineteenth century novel , a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative romantic poetry and ‘ fiction or drama from the @entity64 from 1914 onwards ’			2
exam boards can add extra books , but experts have pointed out that the rules leave very left little room for 20th century writing outside @entity21			1
@entity7 , the classic novel by @entity71 , has also been dropped referring to new specifications , @entity72 , @entity15 ’s head of gcse and a-level reform , said in an interview : ‘ @entity7 , which @entity0 really dislikes , will not be included			1
‘ it was studied by 90 per cent of teenagers taking @entity47 literature gcse in the past			0
@entity0 said that was a really disappointing statistic			1
’ speaking yesterday , mr @entity72 said the @entity48 ‘ restrictions ’ mean there is ‘ no room for texts such as @entity7 or to kill a @entity87 ’ any more			0
he added : ‘ the essential thing is that in the new gcse @entity90 you can not do fiction or drama from 1914 unless it is @entity21			1
’ a series of online petitions have been launched in protest			0
one , signed by 2,567 people already , states that : ‘ modern texts from outside the @entity21 are equally , if not more , important as @entity21 texts			1
’ children ’s laureate , @entity101 , retweeted a newspaper story on the controversy , saying : ‘ surely diversity in the curriculum is vital to encourage more extended reading and to expand our teens ’ minds ? ’ she said her 18 - year - old daughter had described @entity37 as a book that ‘ kids should be reading ’			0
in a blog , children ’s author , @entity114 , said that to kill a mockingbird ’s themes of racism , prejudice and difference are ‘ highly relevant ’ to today ’s children			0
he added : ‘ there should be a balance of pre- 20th century texts and more modern ones and this balance should reflect the breadth of writing in @entity47 , with @entity4 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and other writers present			2
’ another author , @entity133 , who has been nominated for the prestigious @entity134 for children ’s literature , also attacked the move			0
referring to mr @entity0 , he told teenagers on @entity28 to ‘ march up to your parents right now , show them this ( story ) and demand they vote this man out of office ’			2
meanwhile @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity143 tweeted : ‘ do n’t be alarmed if we put your copy of @entity37 in a brown bag today			0
we hear @entity0 might be doing spot checks			2
’ it said that copies of @entity12 had been relocated to its ‘ irony ’ section			0
@entity155 , a senior lecturer in @entity47 at @entity156 , @entity157 , and chairwoman of the @entity159 , described the new syllabus as being ‘ out of the 1940s ’			2
she said : ‘ kids will be put off doing @entity164 literature by this			0
’ a @entity48 spokesman said : ‘ in the past , @entity5 were not rigorous enough and their content was often far too narrow			0
’ a spokesman for @entity169 said it was still finalising its @entity172 specification and would publish it later this week .			0
