more than any other telescope in orbit , @entity0 has expanded the frontiers of human knowledge			1
for 25 years , astronomers have used it to peer deep into distant galaxies with unrivalled clarity , revealing the breathtaking beauty of our universe			0
in the april issue of @entity16 , some of the most stunning images beamed back for the telescope have been revealed			1
the @entity17 is a cold , dark cloud of gas and dust , silhouetted against the bright nebula @entity22			1
the bright area at the top left edge is a young star still embedded in its nursery of gas and dust			2
the nebula is relatively close at 1,500 light years from @entity29 @entity0 has helped scientists understand how planets and galaxies form , detected black holes and changed our theories surrounding dark energy , a mysterious force that causes the universe to expand faster and faster as time goes on			1
the hundreds of thousands of images beamed back from @entity0 have helped scientists unravel cosmic mysteries as well as estimate the age of the universe to about 14 billion years old			1
among them is the @entity17 - a cold , dark cloud of gas and dust , silhouetted against the bright nebula @entity48 434 1,500 light years from @entity29			1
another remarkable image shows a display of starlight , glowing gas , and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust that forms the spiral galaxy @entity48 130			1
this is one of @entity0 's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy			1
some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate - mass stars , when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space			1
in 2002 , a dull star in an obscure constellation suddenly became 600,000 times more luminous than our sun , temporarily making it the brightest star in the @entity71			0
the mysterious star , called @entity73 , has since faded back to obscurity			0
but observations by the @entity0 of a phenomenon called a ' light echo ' around the star have uncovered remarkable new features this huge , young stellar grouping , called @entity81 , is only a few million years old and resides in the 30 @entity82 , a turbulent star - birth region in the @entity84 , a satellite galaxy of the @entity71 the telescope captured a display of starlight , glowing gas , and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this 4 - foot - by - 8 - foot image of the barred spiral galaxy @entity48 130			1
this is one of @entity0 's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy ' launched into orbit aboard the space shuttle @entity98 on april 24 , 1990 , amid flurries of hope and hype , the @entity0 promptly faltered , ' explained @entity102 writing in april 's issue of @entity16 an iconic image from @entity0 captures the dying breaths from planetary nebula @entity106			1
known perhaps more appropriately as the bug or @entity106 , this complex nebula lies roughly 3800 light - years away from us within the @entity71			2
but at first , astronomers did n't expect @entity0 to amount to much			2
' launched into orbit aboard the space shuttle discovery on april 24 , 1990 , amid flurries of hope and hype , the @entity0 promptly faltered , ' explained @entity102 writing in april 's issue of @entity16			2
' rather than remaining locked on its celestial targets , it trembled and shook , quaking like a photophobic vampire whenever sunlight struck its solar panels			0
' opening its protective front door to let starlight in perturbed the telescope so badly that it fell into an electronic coma			0
' worst of all , @entity0 turned out to be myopic			2
its primary light - gathering mirror , eight feet in diameter and said to be the smoothest large object ever fashioned by humans , had been figured perfectly wrong			0
' the telescope 's design had been a compromise			0
while astronomers had wanted a bigger telescope in a higher orbit , they could only get 350 miles ( 550km ) high so that astronauts in space could reach it for repairs			0
next month , the telescope - which is the length of a large school bus and weighs as much as two adult elephants - will celebrate its 25th anniversary			0
to celebrate @entity0 astronomers recently revisited one of its most stunning photos to date , known as ' the pillars of creation			0
' taken in 1995 , the team revealed never - before - seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young , massive stars in a small region of the @entity159 , or @entity159			1
the new @entity0 photo is sharper than the original , and also has a wider field of view			0
it also reveals the base of the cold , gassy columns for the first time			0
and in january the sharpest and largest image ever taken of the @entity168 - the nearest spiral galaxy to our @entity71			2
the @entity0 image shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy ’s pancake - shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light - years			1
the sweeping view , which reveals one third of our galactic neighbour , also suggests that the galaxy may have been battered by a collision with another galaxy two billion years ago			0
the panoramic image has 1.5 billion pixels — meaning you would need more than 600 @entity186 television screens to display the whole image			0
it traces the galaxy from its central galactic bulge on the left , where stars are densely packed together , across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outskirts of its outer disc on the right			2
' that human beings find them to be as beautiful and evocative as photos of earthly sunsets and mountain peaks affirms anew that nature is all of a piece , and that we 're part of it , ' said @entity102			0
some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate - mass stars , when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space			1
