he said : ' they decided to twist his arm back ... the arm that had been shot ... he manoeuvred out of that so they smashed his head against a window			1
' mr @entity2 added : ' i wonder why it took five prison officers to restrain one man and how in the course of that restraint his teeth were able to be knocked out if they were following procedures			2
' the suggestion is that procedures means that prisoners ' teeth are going to be knocked out			0
