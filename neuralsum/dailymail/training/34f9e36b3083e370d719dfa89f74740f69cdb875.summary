in an interview after the launch , @entity0 urged members of the public to get behind the initiative , insisting that it was n’t about supporting what had happened in @entity17 but about the sacrifice of a remarkable group of men and women			2
‘ it 's not about supporting the conflict in @entity17 , it 's not about supporting war , it 's not about supporting the forces themselves ...			2
. just come along and show your support , ’ he said			0
‘ look at the journey these guys have been through ...			0
and also take the opportunity , if you have n't done so , and i am sure there are a lot out there , to come and sit in these seats in these iconic venues			0
’ the prince also expressed his deep - seated fear that people would forget about the on - going battle faced by injured service personnel once @entity20 pulls out of @entity17			1
‘ we are drawing down from @entity17 and people will forget this because something else will come into the news			0
look at the news , see how busy the world is at the moment , ’ he said			0
organisers said more than 300 wounded , injured and sick servicemen and women , serving and veteran , from 13 nations would compete in eight adaptive sports in @entity29 from september 10 - 14 he said : ' hearing the stories that came back from the games really ignited something inside me and made me want to basically broaden this to a wider audience ' ' as i have said the games itself is an excuse to bring attention to the legacy [ of servicemen and women ]			1
we want to get as many of these men and women back into society , giving them jobs and to make sure that all the core values they have been taught in the services to make them amazing , wonderful , strong inspirational people ... that they bring it back into the community for the younger generation			2
why would n't you do that ? ‘ this is not about the @entity8 , this is about the legacy , using the games to catapult that to the forefront of people 's minds			1
‘ speaking from the heart about the plight of the many hundreds of injured soldiers , @entity0 said he believed the @entity8 would play an important part of their recovery			1
' i think the [ warrior ] games [ in the @entity21 ] had such a profound effect on every single individual that actually took part in it , ’ he said			1
' finally they get the chance to set their mind to a task			0
@entity230 in mind these are military people who have been cut down in their prime			0
they want to have a goal in life			0
to be told in a day , ‘ right that 's it , no you ’re not going to walk again , you ’re not going to see again ’			0
this is an opportunity for them and members of the public as well to walk in together with one goal as such			0
' it 's life changing , really it 's life changing			0
listening to them talk about it is inspiring			0
prince @entity0 with the wheelchair basketball teams at the @entity27 in the @entity28 , @entity29 there seemed to be a gap in the conversation between the @entity0 and @entity29 mayor @entity250 , as he attended the launch of the games ' they see this as an opportunity for the next six months to set their mind on a goal , to bring themselves back into society when some of them feel , now that they are disabled , they are pushed aside			2
this is so much more than that			0
‘ although there is going to be a competitive edge to the @entity8 , @entity0 stressed that it was one of the few sporting occasions that the taking part really mattered			1
‘ it 's not about the winning or losing , the fact that the guys have got to this stage to be able to take part in these events , they have already won in my mind , ’ he said			2
' i just hope that september , summertime this year , the sun will be out and it will be wonderful event			0
' dressed in his arm fatigues , @entity0 , a serving @entity112 officer who recently quit flying the @entity283 attack helicopter to take a desk job in @entity29 in order to work on the @entity287 project , added : ‘ hearing the stories that came back from the [ warrior ] games really ignited something inside me and made me want to basically broaden this to a wider audience			1
‘ i saw first - hand the power of sport to inspire recovery , supporting rehabilitation and demonstrating life beyond disability - a group of inspirational people proving anything is possible			0
‘ why bring it to the @entity20 ? well it was such a great concept by the @entity21 that it had to be stolen , quite simple as that , really			1
prince @entity0 was inspired after a visit to the @entity26 in @entity21 last year			2
he is pictured as he participates in a seated volleyball exhibition match , in may 2013 he added : ' this is an inclusive games and we 're going to have hopefully 100 @entity20 competitors , 100 from @entity21 and the rest of the 180 is going to be made up from other nations ' ‘ i wanted to bring this inspirational event to a broader and more international audience			1
’ prime minister @entity316 welcomed the launch of the event as a ‘ wonderful opportunity to recognise the commitment of those who serve in the @entity20 's and our allies ' armed forces and to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who are wounded or injured			2
’ also present at the launch was @entity29 mayor @entity250 who quipped , much to the prince ’s amusement , that when @entity0 first suggested his idea he thought he was resurrecting the ill - fated it ’s a @entity334 or an international version of the @entity336			0
but he went on to describe the @entity8 as ‘ a winner ’			2
the name has been taken from @entity342 ’s famous poem which says : ‘ i am the master of my fate , i am the captain of my soul			0
’ invictus also means , appropriately , in latin ‘ unconquered ’ .			0
