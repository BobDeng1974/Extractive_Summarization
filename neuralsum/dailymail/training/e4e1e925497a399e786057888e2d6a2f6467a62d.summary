' building on our @entity53 heritage as we fast approach our centenary , all about @entity31 by @entity5 is a collection that takes a romanticised stance on florals for summer and uses blush and candy colours mixed with cornflower blues to create a pastel hue , ' said a spokesperson for the store			1
