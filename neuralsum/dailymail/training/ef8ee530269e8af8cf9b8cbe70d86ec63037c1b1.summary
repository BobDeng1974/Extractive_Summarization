winter in @entity2 could be set to get much worse as weather conditions are becoming more volatile because of changes in pressure over the @entity6 , scientists have warned			1
while most seasons have not changed dramatically over the past century - studies have shown that winter is becoming much more unpredictable			2
a study of seasonal records dating back to 1899 by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , @entity12 and the @entity13 found that seven out of the 10 most extreme winter conditions over the last 115 years have occurred in the last decade			1
weaker differences cause the jet stream to wander into a ' blocking ' position , bringing drier and snowier weather the results suggest the idea of a typical @entity2 ' white ' winter is increasingly becoming a myth , with one year experiencing mild but stormy conditions while deep snow could follow 12 months later			1
professor @entity32 , from the @entity11 ’s climatic research unit , said : ' this indicates that @entity2 winters have become increasingly unsettled			2
' if this trend continues , we can expect more volatile @entity2 winter weather in decades to come			2
' winter conditions are commonly defined using @entity40 ( @entity40 ) - a system of barometric pressure variations which indicates the strength of westerly winds approaching the @entity2			0
when there are marked differences between low and high centres of barometric pressure - known as @entity19 and the @entity20 , respectively - westerly winds are strong , @entity2 experiences mild , wet and often stormy weather - like last winter			0
winter in @entity2 could be set to get much worse as weather conditions become more volatile , scientists have warned weaker differences or reverse airflow typically brings cold , snowy weather , such as that experienced in 2009/10 and 2010/11			0
the variations were particularly noticeable in early winter			0
mr @entity32 said : ' when we look at the month of december in particular , our data shows that over the last 115 years , three out of five all - time record high @entity40 values and two out of five record lows took place in the last decade			1
' professor @entity65 , from the @entity12 ’s department of geography , said it was too soon to say whether the increased volatility is linked to global warming			0
the results suggest the idea of a typical @entity2 ' white ' winter is increasingly becoming a myth , with one year experiencing mild but stormy conditions while deep snow could follow 12 months later but the study , published in the @entity77 , states that it was extreme unlikely the clustering of extreme conditions had happened by chance			1
the trend could be due to random fluctuations in the climate system but could equally be due to factors including changing pressure and weather systems over the @entity88 , especially @entity89 , and changes in energy coming from the sun. mr @entity65 said : ' we can not use these results directly to predict this winter ’s weather but , according to the long - term @entity40 trend , we can say that the probability of getting extreme winter weather - either mild / stormy or cold / snowy - has significantly increased in the last few decades			0

studies of seasons since 1899 show winter becoming more unpredictable
seven out of 10 most extreme winters in 115 years occurred in last decade
it means a typical @entity2 ' white ' winter is increasingly becoming a myth
