by @entity0 @entity3 data speeds on mobile devices are dropping at an alarming rate in the @entity6 , a new study has warned			1
in the february 2014 report , the @entity6 ranked 15th of 16 countries for download speeds , as the average data rate dropped to @entity11 from 9.6 megabits per second in the february 2013 report			1
the authors say @entity6 networks ' uniformly perform poorly ' for speed - increasing claims the technology has not yet lived up to the hype surrounding its launch			1
@entity19 speeds : the @entity6 ranked 15th of 16 countries for download speeds , as the average data rate dropped to @entity11 from 9.6 megabits per second in february 2013			1
to create the graphics , @entity22 took data from users of its speed testing app , which has 6 million users			2
it focussed on their experience of two key metrics : download speed , and the proportion of time spent with @entity35 access			0
of the country 's major network operators , @entity36 had the best data rate , at @entity40			1
@entity41 rated @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44			1
however , @entity43 , followed by @entity41 , rated much better for coverage			1
@entity46 recorded the slowest speeds of all eligible networks , possibly a result of their small spectrum allocation , which uses a @entity52 band while most @entity6 carriers use @entity54			1
the data was collected by the @entity22 app. it warned that operators may be attempting to decieve customers over the speed of @entity3			2
' network operators around the world are working hard to convince their users to make the jump to @entity35			0
' the term ' 4g ' acts as a convenient label for marketers to emphasise the superiority of this new standard over its predecessors			0
' we found that not all @entity35 networks are created equal , indeed there is an extremely broad range of experience across both metrics			0
' only about a quarter of networks surveyed achieve both good coverage and fast speeds ; clearly there remains much work before @entity35 lives up to its full potential			0
' to create the graphics , @entity22 took data from those of our 6 million users who have lte and focussed on their experience of two key metrics : download speed , and the proportion of time spent with @entity35 access , ' the firm said			2
how did your network do ? the report also looked at individual operators - and @entity46 recorded the slowest speeds of all eligible networks , possibly a result of their small spectrum allocation , which uses a @entity52 band while most @entity6 carriers use @entity54			1
' looking at coverage goes some way towards mitigating the @entity110 € ™ s poor speed performance , ' it said			0
' the @entity110 performs well on our coverage metric , with the average user experiencing @entity35 coverage 67 % of the time , with @entity116 , the fastest country , on 58 %			2
@entity22 said speeds tended to drop as a carrier takes on more users			0
' this is the reason that some countries have improved since our last report a year ago , while others have worsened , ' it said most of the country averages have stayed broadly the same , with only minor improvement or deterioration in service			0
@entity116 and @entity130 have made the biggest improvements , with @entity133 € ™ s average speeds increasing 42 % to @entity134 and @entity130 improving 66 % to @entity135			0
the @entity110 suffers the biggest decline , with average speeds falling 32 % to 6.5 mbps , the second slowest global average .			0

@entity6 average data rate dropped to @entity11 from 9.6 megabits over last year
@entity36 had the best data rate at @entity40
@entity41 rated @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44
