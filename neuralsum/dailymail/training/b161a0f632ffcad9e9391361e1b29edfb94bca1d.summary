‘ how could you purposely set a small kitten on fire ? ‘ i was beginning to worry because it was the first time she had ever really ventured out			1
“ she was dead silent when i found her back in the house , which thinking back to it now was strange , and when i picked her up it felt like she was covered in mud			2
‘ it was n’t until i turned on the light that i saw her entire side was black			2
there was a huge mass of singed fur			0
