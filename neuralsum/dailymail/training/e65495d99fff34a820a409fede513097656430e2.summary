by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:01 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 09:27 est , 24 november 2013 @entity3 chairman @entity2 is alleged to have secretly asked his regular dealer for cocaine just two days after he publicly pledged to seek ‘ professional help ’ for his drug abuse , @entity8 has learned			1
on tuesday , while in hiding from the media , he contacted drug dealer @entity10 – who @entity2 gave £ 300 to in the extraordinary video we published last week			1
later in a telephone conversation he allegedly asked for more drugs			1
the suspended @entity16 minister had made a contrite statement through the church last sunday – apologising for ‘ stupid and wrong ’ actions in buying crack cocaine and other drugs			1
but shocking new evidence shows his appetite is apparently as rapacious as ever			2
inviting @entity10 , 35 , a convicted drug dealer whose name we have changed , to stay with him at his @entity36 ‘ safe house ’ , @entity2 said : ‘ so			1
just er , turn up , and if you want to bring the boy @entity38 , that ’s fine too			1
’ @entity40 - based @entity10 , who taped the call which @entity8 on sunday reporters have heard and verified , confirmed that they have no mutual friends called @entity38 , and other texts we publish today show it was @entity2 ’s habitual term for cocaine			1
‘ i had absolutely no doubt @entity49 was referring to coke , ’ @entity10 told @entity8 last night			2
‘ he always used that word for it			2
‘ a bit earlier in the conversation , i asked him if it would be ok to smoke a spliff at the house – which belongs to another @entity16 minister friend of his – and @entity49 said that would be fine as long as i did it in the garden			1
how the story broke last sunday ‘ but he only mentioned “ @entity38 ” right at the end of the conversation , trying to make it sound like a casual aside , but we both knew what he was talking about and i certainly do n’t know anyone called @entity38			1
’ flowers told @entity10 he had been using drugs since 2010 , which would include nearly all of his spell at the @entity3 – and also astonished him by saying he did n’t believe in @entity77			1
@entity10 said : ‘ he told me that he has been doing drugs for three years , so how much attention he ever paid to his business at the bank is anyone ’s guess			2
i know how much all these drugs affect your mental powers and concentration			2
’ he went on : ‘ i only found out he was a reverend when i saw his picture online with a dog collar			0
in fact , he told me that he did n’t believe in @entity77			1
‘ the other thing that amazes me is that he was a trustee on the board of the @entity96 but he never practises safe sex			0
' he never wears a condom			0
it was even more staggering that he told me his brother had died of @entity102 aged 39			0
’ the day after @entity8 ’s revelations last week , the @entity96 , @entity104 ’s biggest @entity103 charity , announced @entity2 ’s resignation from the post after two years			1
added @entity10 : ‘ @entity49 ’s been a really heavy user of coke and ketamine for a long time			0
recently other drugs too , and whatever he said in his statement , it ’s not going to be easy for him to come off them just because he ’s been publicly exposed			0
‘ i laughed when i saw his statement saying he was getting professional help – the only professional help he was seeking was from a professional drug fixer – me			2
’ in a taped telephone conversation later on tuesday , @entity2 told @entity10 – after he had changed his mind about the invitation to @entity36 – they could have a ‘ couple of nights away ’ and suggested @entity122			1
@entity2 said : ‘ we ca n’t go abroad , i do n’t think , but we could find somewhere either quiet , or somewhere very busy			2
we could go to @entity122 if you like			0
’ @entity2 was staying with @entity125 , an ex-addict minister who has spoken about his battles with drugs and alcohol and has a house in the city @entity10 pointed out to @entity2 that with the media storm , he would soon be spotted , and asked if he thought that a good idea			1
@entity73 ’s reply gave an indication of the supreme arrogance which has been at the root of his downfall : ‘ @entity138			0
i think one should be brazen in certain circumstances ’			2
the pair first met two months ago through a gay app called @entity142 , said @entity10			0
‘ he messaged me saying , “ do you want to come to a party and sniff some coke ? ” ’ ex-con @entity10 became @entity2 ’s regular dealer			1
‘ not only did i get to sell him the drugs , i also got to use them for nothing afterwards , ’ he said			0
‘ on remembrance sunday , @entity2 left the house in the morning to go and conduct the service in @entity154			1
‘ we had been up most of the night but that did n’t stop him laying out a great fat line of coke in the morning , which he sniffed up before he left			0
‘ i did get worried about him sometimes because his coke habit was massive			0
he took huge quantities of it , and he ’s 63 years old and clearly overweight			0
‘ he ’s really pushing his luck , especially combining it with ketamine , crack and @entity165			0
’ the @entity8 put all the allegations in our stories today to the @entity73 ’s solicitor , former chairman of @entity171 @entity170 @entity169 last night			0
mr @entity169 said : ‘ i can not comment on any of these allegations , save to say i find it utterly fanciful and they smack of the kind of contrived nonsense that has been mentioned about my client			0
‘ if he has a comment to make i ’m sure he ’ll contact me and make an appropriate statement , but at the moment , police enquiries are ongoing and you ’ll appreciate that i ’m not saying anything			0

' i think one should be brazen , ' said minister who ' did *n't* believe in @entity77 '
@entity2 spoke to dealer two days after saying he was seeking help
he invited him to an ex-addict minister *'s* house in @entity36
he allegedly asked him to ' bring @entity38 ' , a *slang* word for cocaine
