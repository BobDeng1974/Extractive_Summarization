' now the so - called @entity32 has apparently changed her mind and taken up a part - time job at the @entity9 fashion house @entity10 , where she will remain for the next three years until her sentence is complete , after she had time taken off for good behaviour			1
judge @entity39 agreed to her release after @entity12 's lawyer @entity41 presented a request and also added that she was willing to be taken into the care of social services while working as a style consultant at @entity46			0
mr @entity41 said his client had offered to work at the showroom after she contacted them from her cell at @entity9 's @entity52 prison			1
it is a complete reversal from 2011 when she said ' i would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants , ' adding she wanted to stay inside because she wanted to take care of her pet ferret			1
@entity1 's initial decision was not entirely a surprise to those that know her			0
she once famously summed up her lavish luxury lifestyle , which included apartments in @entity9 and @entity65 , by saying : ' i 'd rather cry in a @entity66 then by happy on a bicycle			2
' @entity1 who has two daughters @entity70 , 31 , and @entity71 , 38 , had previously been allowed out on day release to visit them and her elderly mother at the @entity9 flat where the family lived when her husband was still alive			2
her original trial heard how she ordered the murder of her husband in 1995 , after he offered her $ 650,000 in a divorce settlement			2
she rejected the settlement , describing it as a ' plate of lentils ' and insisting she wanted at least $ 1million			0
when mr @entity12 refused she hired hitman @entity83 , who shot him four times as he arrived at his office on march 27 , 1995			1
plot : @entity12 , pictured left in 1994 , was shot four times by hitman @entity83 , shown right in the defendants cage at his trial in 1998 , as he arrived for work at his office in central @entity9 on march 27 , 1995 @entity1 was found guilty of ordering 46 - year - old mr @entity12 's death after her clairvoyant and confidante @entity91 turned informer and told police about the plot			1
the trial , where it emerged that the defendant was furious after she discovered her husband had dumped her for a younger woman , captivated not only @entity100 but the world			0
@entity12 - who arrived in court in designer outfits every day - told the judge and jury of how she had been betrayed by ms @entity91 , saying : ' never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop			0
sooner or later it will get hungry			0
' nine years ago her legal team tried to get the conviction overturned on the grounds of her ill health , claiming she had been affected by a brain tumour , but the case fizzled out			2
reversal : @entity1 had previously rejected offers of parole because she would be compelled to take a job , saying ' i would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants , ' and take care of her pet ferret @entity10 's owner @entity129 said : ' we were very surprised when she contacted us and asked about working for us but we are more than happy to help			1
she can advise us on window displays and supplies			0
' the @entity1 family was one of @entity100 's richest and most well known ' dynasty families ' and their saga has even been turned into a tv series			0

@entity12 was the grandson of @entity144 , founder of the fashion company made famous with its double g logo			0
