‘ i think it is onwards and upwards , ’ @entity0 told @entity60			2
‘ i do n’t think there ’s anyway back now and you ’ve found your way			0
sometimes you get lost on the road to where you want to go to and now they ’ve found their way again			0
‘ they look more than a useful team because i ’ve watched them a few times this season			0
they play some really good football and i think you ’ll be very welcome in the @entity76 , i ’m sure of that , and you ’ll do well			0
’ @entity0 arrived at @entity2 ' @entity78 earlier in the afternoon prior to leading the tributes @entity0 was in distinguished company , with former @entity8 man @entity81 ( back ) also present meanwhile , @entity2 legend @entity82 insists there is no chance the newly - crowned @entity55 winners will slack off out of respect for the teams still chasing promotion			1

‘ they ’ll want to show between now and the end of the season they ’re good enough for the @entity106			0
‘ there is also the integrity of the competition			0
@entity96 are in a huge battle and there ’s no way @entity16 or the staff will rest players or put out what people perceive as a weakened team			0
