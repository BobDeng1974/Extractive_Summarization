by @entity0 he 'd already scooped a prize catch and then he got a real surprise			2
opening the mouth of a glistening jungle perch to pull out his lure , angler @entity4 discovered a bright green tree frog inside the fish 's mouth			1
and the @entity13 amphibian looked more than happy just where he was - with what looked like a smug smile on his face			1
@entity20 throat : @entity21 found a green tree frog inside the mouth of a jungle perch while fishing at the weekend in @entity24 , @entity25 ' i was shocked			1
i thought it might have been green grass at first , then it blinked , ' the professional field fisherman told @entity30			0
mr @entity4 caught the fish - together with the frog - in waters about an hour 's north of @entity24 , far north @entity25			1
but once the exotic amphibian had been disturbed he made his great escape - jumping straight over mr @entity4 ' head			2
of course , that was not before mr @entity4 had manged to take a swift picture of the incredible occurrence			0
the fishing enthusiast said : ' i always carry a camera so i took the pic and then he jumped out			0
' what a catch : the professional fisherman got more than he bargained for when he caught this jungle perch the green tree fog is a species native to @entity13 and @entity48 , with introduced populations in @entity50 and the @entity51			1
larger than most @entity13 frogs , it can reach 4 inches in length			0
there 's no telling how long it had been nestled inside the jungle perch 's mouth but the average lifespan of the frog in captivity is about 16 years			1
it is known to scream when it is in danger to scare off its foe , and squeaks when it is touched , but mr @entity4 reported no such noises so presumably the frog was not too frightened by being discovered in its unlikely home			0
after his special sighting at the weekend , mr @entity4 sent the photo to @entity72 , which posted it on @entity74 , earning 40,000 likes and 2000 comments			0
one impressed angler commented : ' he [ the frog ] looks like he 's smiling			2
i guess i would be too if i were him			0
