@entity0 will make an external appointment in their search for a new head coach with @entity4 and @entity5 the leading candidates to replace @entity7			1
@entity8 understands that reports of shortlists as big as eight men being drawn up are exaggerated and managing director @entity12 and chief scout @entity13 have instead narrowed their targets			0
@entity18 ’s @entity4 is the only domestic - based boss being considered and , despite denials from @entity21 chief executive @entity20 , he could yet end up at @entity16 , albeit with a compensation package agreed			1
@entity4 is on @entity0 's shortlist to replace @entity7 as the new head coach former @entity24 head coach @entity5 is also being considered by @entity0 @entity25 , though , would not have to pay a penny in severance for former @entity24 chief @entity5			1
the @entity29 defender left @entity24 at the end of last season after three years in charge and , like @entity4 , fits the bill of ‘ head coach ’ the @entity35 want to take care of first - team affairs			1
caretaker boss @entity38 , meanwhile , has not been told if he will be in charge for saturday ’s trip to league leaders @entity42			2
he will take training on tuesday but as of monday night night there was no word from the club ’s hierarchy as to whether he will still be at the helm come the weekend			0
@entity7 left @entity0 to take over at @entity50 where he spent time as a player caretaker manager @entity38 does not know if he will be in charge for this weekend 's game with @entity42 @entity38 – who has applied for the position – looks set to start @entity55 at @entity56 - should he be picking the team - after the goalkeeper returned to training on monday			1
the @entity61 @entity60 has been absent since injuring his ankle in november and was expected to be sidelined until the end of january			0
@entity0 have conceded 21 times in his absence and rookie replacement @entity67 could well have played his last game for the club with his contract up in the summer			2
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity55 is in line to face @entity42 after returning to training after an ankle injury @entity38 said he has sympathy with stand - in keeper @entity67 after a difficult time in goal @entity38 , though , praised the 21 - year - old			2
‘ he 's had a bit of a tough time with the goals that we 've conceded and i 've felt a little bit sorry for @entity67 , but he 's been a strong lad , ’ he said			0
‘ he 's stood up to it			0
it 's not easy when you 're a young lad and you 've got to be able to deal with the pressure , because it takes a special type of player to play at this football club and if you ca n't handle the pressure of the 52,000 every other week then you 'll not survive here			0

@entity7 left @entity0 to become @entity50 's new manager
@entity18 manager @entity4 and former @entity24 boss @entity5
