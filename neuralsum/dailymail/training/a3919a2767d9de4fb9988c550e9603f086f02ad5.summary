by @entity0 last updated at 4:46 am on 20th january 2012 a three - year - old girl has been refused life - changing treatment on the @entity3 , leaving her family outraged			1
@entity5 is unable to walk unaided as she was diagnosed at birth with cerebral palsy , a neurological condition which causes problems with movement and coordination			1
in a bid to help their daughter , @entity5 's parents applied for corrective surgery , but healthcare bosses have refused to fund the £ 23,000 operation , available just miles away at a local hospital			1
@entity5 , aged three , has been refused life - changing treatment on the @entity3 leaving her family outraged the @entity20 are now desperately trying to raise funds for the operation , known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy , which could see @entity5 walk for the first time			1
her mother @entity24 , 28 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ' without the surgery she will not be able to walk by herself			2
' she has a walker , which she probably manages about ten steps with before she gets really tired so mainly she crawls around			0
' ' i want @entity5 to have the surgery as close to her fourth birthday in march as possible as she is not at school yet and it will not interfere with that			1
@entity35 can only manage a few steps with the aid of a walking frame ' i can see in her face how frustrated she gets at not being able to join in with her friends walking and dancing and will make a difference to all of us as a family			1
' @entity5 was delivered ten weeks early after her mother suffered a fall			1
she spent her first seven weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity47 , @entity26 , where brain scans revealed that she had cerebral palsy			0
while she can do many of the things that her peers can , she can only crawl or walk a few steps with the aid of a walking frame			0
but her mother came across a new type of surgery which could help her daughter get back on her feet			0
the operation involves cutting nerves in the spinal cord to overcome the tightening of muscles that makes it difficult for many with cerebral palsy to walk			0
previously the treatment was only available in the @entity67 but ms @entity24 was delighted when she discovered that a local hospital was one of the first to offer the service in the @entity71			1
the family applied immediately through their local @entity3			1
however a funding panel refused the application stating that @entity5 ’s case was not strong enough			2
the family are now facing the challenge of raising the funds themselves			0
a letter from @entity3 @entity26 said : ' the panel agreed that there is a small but significant cohort of patients who may benefit from this new developing procedure			2
cerebral palsy is a general term used by doctors to refer to a set of neurological conditions that affect a child 's movement and co-ordination			0
caused by damage to the brain , which normally occurs before , during or soon after birth			0
symptoms vary greatly from child to child - some children have problems walking , while others are profoundly disabled and require lifelong care			0
related conditions or problems , include epilepsy , learning difficulties , hearing impairment , delayed growth and a curved spine it is not a progressive condition - meaning it will not get worse as a child gets older - however , it can put a great deal of strain on the body , which can cause problems in later life			1
there is no cure but a range of treatments can help relieve symptoms			0
' they had not been supplied with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that miss @entity5 has the potential to benefit over and above other patients with a similar condition for whom this treatment is also not currently available			1
' the family appealed against the initial decision , but now they are focused on fundraising to pay for the treatment on a private basis			2
ms @entity24 , who also has a five - month - old son , @entity139 , with partner @entity140 , added : ' this is a postcode lottery - they are saying the treatment is not available to other children but it is to those in other parts of the country			2
' since last may , when the surgery was first introduced at @entity150 , @entity26 , 12 operations have been carried out by consultant neurosurgeon @entity151 , who learnt the technique at @entity153 in the @entity67 as the only hospital in the @entity71 currently offering the procedure , referrals have come in from across the country , with most being paid for by the @entity3			2
a further 14 children have been assessed by mr @entity151 and had funding refused by their local @entity3 trust			1
a spokesperson for the primary care trust said : ' unfortunately , the need for healthcare services usually exceeds the resources available			0
' we can not always provide @entity3 funding for all of the treatments that patients request			2
' it is estimated that 1 in every 400 children in the @entity71 is affected by cerebral palsy and 1,800 babies are diagnosed with the condition each year			0
