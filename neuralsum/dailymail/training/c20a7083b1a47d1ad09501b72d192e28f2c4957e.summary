by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 20:02 est , 27 march 2013 for many ardent shoppers , half the fun of hitting their favourite stores is casually browsing what 's on offer and looking around for a bargain			2
but do n't expect a warm welcome if you 're not planning on buying anything from one @entity12 store - not only will you leave empty handed but also out of pocket			2
the @entity11 in @entity14 has sparked outrage by charging customers a $ 5 ' just looking ' fee			1
the shop , which specialises in @entity20 and diary free food as well as supplies for diabetics , started charging browsers back in february in a bid to stop customers using the store as a ' reference point ' and then buying goods elsewhere , according to the @entity30			1
controversial : a typed note informing customers that they will have to pay a charge for browsing in a store in @entity14 , @entity12 a note in the door of the shop , which has since been posted on @entity38 , explains that customers will be given their $ 5 dollars back when they make a purchase			1
it reads : ' there has been high volume of people who use this store as a reference point and then purchase goods elsewhere			1
' these people are unaware our prices are almost the same as the other stores plus we have products simply not available anywhere else			0
' the owner of the store , named in reports only as @entity57 , claims that the policy is in line with other clothing , shoe and electronic stores facing the same issues with customers not buying items			1
and if an @entity68 study carried out by the @entity69 which found in january that nearly 50 per cent of @entity68 online purchases were browsed in stores first , @entity57 may have a point			0
shopkeeper @entity57 told the @entity74 : ' it 's not my own idea , i have heard of other shops doing it , but they have n't put a sign up at the front door			0
@entity81 has put up a sign outside the front door of his furniture and antiques shop in @entity86 , @entity87 , which reads in bold letters ' @entity88 ' ' i have to wake people up , everything in life is not free			1
' i do n't want to take the job of a dietician , i do n't want to take the job of a naturopath or a nutritionist , but people are expecting freebies all the time and when you say ' hey , you 're costing me time and effort ' , they do n't like the idea of paying			0
' the charge echoes the policy of @entity107 shopkeeper @entity81 who banned tourists living outside a 30 mile radius from entering his @entity113 's @entity112 antiques store in @entity86 , @entity87			2
he introduced the ban after becoming fed up with ' time wasting ' tourists browsing his store while waiting for their bus home			0
while footfall at the store is said to have dropped around 90 per cent , mr @entity81 says that he is making more money since he introduced the ban .			0

@entity11 in @entity14 has been charging customers since february
the charge is to deter people from using the store as a ' reference point '
the shop 's owner said that ' not everything in life is free '
