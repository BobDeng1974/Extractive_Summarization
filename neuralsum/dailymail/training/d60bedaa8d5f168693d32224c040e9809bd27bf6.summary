women who live with their partners are more likely to accidentally become pregnant than those who are single or married , a new study has found			1
researchers found most couples who live together said they intended to delay childbirth until they were married , steadily employed and financially stable			0
working class women were most likely to have a surprise pregnancy researchers found accidental pregnancy was especially common among working class couples who struggled to access reliable contraceptives and often forgot to use them			1
this was compared to middle - class couples where the women could access contraceptives more easily and tended to talk about contraception more openly with their partners			1
the study was conducted in the @entity12 where unlike the @entity11 , contraceptives are not free and are generally included in health insurance plans			2
men in middle class relationships often helped ensure their partners used contraception , by reminding them about it , helping them set alarms , or by paying for prescriptions			2
in the study , middle class couples were characterised as being university - educated and having a job that required a degree			2
the study , carried out by social scientists from @entity43 and the @entity44 involved 61 middle class and working class couples who lived together			1
they were quizzed about their relationships and their use of contraception			0
they study found that women in cohabiting couples were the most likely to become accidentally pregnant , with working class women more likely to have a surprise pregnancy than middle class women			1
working class women in the @entity12 reported that job instability or unemployment left them without health insurance or health plans that covered contraceptives			1
lead author professor @entity66 , from @entity43 , said : ' women who are on the same page as their partners regarding childbirth and who are able to communicate with partners are more efficacious contraceptors			0
middle class couples living together used contraceptives more effectively and talked about them more openly			2
men helped their partners by reminding them about contraceptives and paying for prescriptions ' since it is the middle - class women who are more likely to be in this position , they are therefore in greater control of their reproductive destiny than their working - class counterparts			1
' she added that the research looked at the barriers facing working class women			1
she said : ' women mentioned the cost of going for a doctor 's visit ; paying for birth control pills , which insurance once had covered but no longer did ; or not being able to afford the out - of - pocket expense on insurance plans with meagre coverage as barriers			0
' she added that this was one of the only studies to include men 's perspectives on family planning and contraceptive use			0
she said : ' we find that men are often involved in ensuring contraception is regularly used – whether by reminding partners , helping them program their phone or helping to pay for a prescription that is too expensive			0
' social marketing programs can target male partners to participate in deferring pregnancy until couples are ready – relationally , emotionally and financially – to become parents			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity116 .			0
