' the likeness between @entity0 and my daughter is uncanny , ' @entity13 , 41 , tells @entity17			1
' before i came across @entity0 , i was reluctant to allow @entity6 to start at such a young age			1
now i realize that the time for her is right			0
' logic dictates that @entity6 could in all likelihood achieve a similar - or dare i say better - standing as a child model , ' she theorizes			1
ms @entity13 first came across @entity0 , based in @entity24 , after reading about her two months ago on @entity17			1
@entity0 's story triggered widespread outrage over her young age , with critics slamming the girl 's mother @entity49 for posting scantily - clad images of her daughter to @entity52 ; many of which garnered sick comments referring to @entity0 as a ' babe ' and praising her ' long legs			1

' i was shell - shocked , ' she recalls , adding that she immediately sent the article around to friends and family , all of whom responded with observations along the lines of : ' lovely photos of @entity6			1
' ms @entity13 explains : ' when i clarified that the photos were not of @entity6 but of another little girl , most were in disbelief			1
' and when i showed @entity6 a picture of @entity0 , she asked , “ mommy when did you take that photo of me , i do n’t remember that shirt ? ” ' ms @entity13 , who also has a 14 - year - old son , @entity28 , claims it was on this day that she realized , ' i could no longer come between @entity6 ’s dreams of becoming a model			1
' she promptly set up a shoot with photographer @entity105 , in which @entity6 copied some of @entity0 's poses to demonstrate their ' twin - like ' similarities			1
@entity110 : @entity6 's mother ms @entity13 ( left ) and @entity0 's mother @entity49 ( right ) , both of whom are helping their daughters realize their modeling dreams @entity116 : ms @entity13 ( left ) is a full - time mother and former real estate broker , while mrs @entity0 ( right ) is also a full - time mother and a former model more parallels : @entity6 is a talented hip - hop dancer ( left ) and @entity0 is a competitive gymnast ( right ) @entity6 was quickly snapped up by two agencies who were sent the photos ; @entity123 , an adults - only agency based in @entity7 and @entity126 , which will represent @entity6 in @entity127 over the school holidays			1
helpfully , @entity6 is a citizen of both @entity8 and the @entity129			2
folio agent @entity130 , who made an exception when she signed up the agency 's only child model , states : ' @entity6 is an exceptionally beautiful little girl who i believe has great potential in the modeling industry			1
' the resemblance between @entity6 and @entity0 is absolutely remarkable and we see a promising future for her			2
' ms @entity13 is well - aware that many see @entity0 as too young and , worse , too sexualized by her mother , but she disagrees with these sentiments			1
' i do not believe that many of the accusations made against @entity0 ’s mother are fair , ' she remarks			2
' i believe that fundamentally , she has her daughter ’s best interests at heart			0
' she adds : ' sadly , we live in a world where we as parents must be vigilant in protecting the safety of our children from those wishing to exploit or seek to harm them			0
' as @entity6 ’s @entity157 , i will seek to find a safe and healthy balance vis - a - vis @entity6 ’s public exposure in her pursuit of a career in modeling			0

' inevitably , there is a degree of public exposure for child models , actors and the like ' , she says			0
indeed , a large part of her lookalike @entity0 's rising worldwide fame is thanks to her social media presence			1
both her @entity177 page - which boasts nearly three million followers - and her @entity52 account are manned by @entity0 's mother			1
speaking to @entity17 in december in defense of these social media accounts , mrs @entity0 , 39 , said : ' you must think like a pedophile in order to see something sexual in [ @entity0 's ] pictures , so it is time for you to see a doctor			1
' in fact i must say she does not especially like it when i am photographing her , so i do it quickly and when she does n't notice			0
i am certain in my mind all her photographs are absolutely innocent			0
' @entity6 , on the other hand , is far from camera - shy and has been expressing an interest in modelling since the age of eight			0
' @entity6 is mature for her age and is a determined girl , ' ms @entity13 explains			2
' i have given careful consideration to my decision to allow her to pursue her dream of becoming a model			0
' she adds : ' i do not believe that there is a “ magical ” age when suddenly this becomes right			0
i think quite simply that one must look at what ’s best for the individual child			0

' her education is paramount			0
i believe that with the right support , @entity6 can have it all			0
' ms @entity13 , who is willing to make ' special exceptions ' for @entity6 missing school to take up modeling jobs , is herself clearly an ambitious force to be reckoned with			2
' i was forced to abandon my demanding and budding career as a real estate broker at @entity258 ( formerly with @entity259 's ) to return to being a full - time mother when the children ’s father left @entity8 in early 2012 to live in the @entity129 , ' she explains			2

' however , with the exception of a runway stint for a @entity8 swimsuit store , it was not something that i pursued			0
