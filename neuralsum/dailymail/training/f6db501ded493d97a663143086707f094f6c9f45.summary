' reports claim the 2013 @entity1 ( pictured ) , which was billed as a low - cost @entity14 and was designed to appeal to a wider audience , is to be killed off as early as next summer			1
manufacturers will begin winding down production of the handset from january , and are expected to pull the plug completely in the ' middle of 2015 ' @entity2 launched its @entity1 alongside the high - end @entity19 in september 2013			1
it is similar in size to the @entity19 , but does n't t have the @entity24 fingerprint scanner or the @entity26 processor seen in the more expensive model			0
amidst the furore of the @entity14 launch in september , @entity2 silently killed off its @entity30			1
but it was n't a drop in sales that brought about its demise , according to boss @entity36 , instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts			0
speaking at the @entity40 conference , mr @entity36 said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player			0
and although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years , sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin			0
mr @entity36 added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts , but it would n't have been cost - effective and would have involved a ' massive ' task			0
it has a plastic case , is available in five different colours , and at launch , prices started at $ 99 in the @entity59 , on a two - year contract , or $ 549 and £ 469 when bought outright			0
the device was also the first @entity2 phone to be offered in the smaller @entity64 model			0
the report , by @entity67 's @entity66 , did not reveal the reasons behind the plans , but @entity2 has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions			1
sales of the @entity1 were also poor , compared to the company 's expectations , and in january , research firm @entity75 reports the model accounted for just 27 per cent of @entity14 sales at the end of 2013			1
it recently killed off its @entity30			0
when @entity2 ’s online store came back online following its @entity14 event in september , this later model was missing from the @entity30 lineup			2
@entity2 did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time			0
@entity2 boss @entity36 later said the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts , but it would n't have been cost - effective and would have involved a ' massive ' task			2
the report did not reveal the reasons behind the plans , but @entity2 has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions			1
sales of the @entity1 ( pictured at launch with @entity2 executive @entity97 ) were also lower than the company 's expectations @entity2 is said to be forsaking its @entity1 to focus on production of its high - end iphone 6 range ( pictured ) ' we could n't get the parts anymore , not anywhere on @entity104 , ' explained mr @entity36			1
' it was n't a matter of me swinging the axe , saying " what can i kill today ? " the @entity109 was the @entity2 ’s first digital music player , and although the original debuted in 2001 , there were six generations released up until 2007			2
@entity2 is said to be forsaking its @entity1 to focus on production of its high - end @entity14 range .			1
