by @entity1 reporter when strangers kept telling @entity3 he was a dead ringer for @entity5 , the student hit on a brilliant idea			1
he gave up university in the hope of making a lucrative living as a lookalike of the @entity12 heart - throb			2
but the 25 - year - old has had only six jobs in more than a year – mostly at children ’s parties – at £ 100 a time			1
he even says he ca n’t have a girlfriend because they get too jealous of all the attention he receives			1
the former engineering student claims he is a ‘ distraction ’ for women who can not stop looking at him - and often brings crowds of females ‘ to a standstill ’			1
he added : ‘ at first i did n’t really notice i looked like @entity5 because one direction is more for young girls , so i did n’t really take an interest in the band			2
‘ but soon people were stopping and gawping at me in the streets and friends and family were commenting on our similar looks			2
it has its ups and downs , looking like a famous singer			0
‘ but i can bring a whole coffee shop or restaurant to a standstill when i go out dressed in @entity5 ’s trademark clothing - bandana round my head , skinny jeans and leather boots			2
‘ on top of this , i talk like him and i have the same swagger - i just am him			2
it can be difficult looking like someone famous but i guess this is my life now			0
there ’s not much i can do about my face			0

’ ' when everyone fancies you , the novelty wears off after a while ' @entity3 he says his lukewarm success as a lookalike since packing in his @entity87 engineering course is because everyone in his home town of @entity19 , @entity20 , already knows he is n’t the real @entity5			1
he is now thinking of moving south			0
‘ when i ’m in @entity72 i ca n’t walk around without being mobbed			1
there ’s got to be money in looking like i do			0
i need to make the most of it while @entity5 ’s so big			0
’ but not everyone in the seaside resort agrees that he is such a twin for the pop star			0
one local , 18 - year - old @entity97 , said : ‘ he looks like @entity5 ’s third cousin			1
i suppose he has the same hair			0
he looks more like my uncle @entity100			0
’ @entity101 , 17 , a @entity12 fan from the town , was less subtle , saying : ‘ he ’s completely deluded			0
’ compared : mr @entity3 ( left ) has only had six jobs in more than a year - mostly at children ’s parties , but insisted his lack of success is down to ' everyone ' in his hometown already knowing he is not the real @entity5 ( right ) one direction : @entity5 ( left ) pictured with bandmates @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 mr @entity3 is currently signed to five lookalike agencies and makes £ 100 an hour for each appearance - but has had so little work that he is thinking of moving to the capital he said : ‘ if i lived in @entity72 it would be a different story			1
