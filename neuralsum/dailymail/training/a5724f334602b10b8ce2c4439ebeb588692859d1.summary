by @entity0 published : 03:37 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 06:28 est , 25 september 2012 theme park managers are taking the drastic measure of breath testing students , after too many have vomited on rollercoasters while drunk or hungover during the first week of university			2
but far from turning them away , @entity7 staff are instead happily directing those who are over the limit to the most extreme rollercoaster - which hurtles them through the air head - first at up to 60mph			1
it might sound like a harsh lesson , but research supported by the park has found the blast of fresh air on @entity20 is exactly what queasy guests need to settle their stomachs and avoid being sick			2
staff members will now be breathalysing students and directing those over the limit to adrenaline - boosting rides to cure their hangovers staff have seen a massive 250 per cent increase in the number of people being sick on rides this week , as new students arrive at university for the first time and get stuck in to the infamous alcohol - fueled freshers week			1
the @entity40 park , which is close to a number of universities , will breathalyse students to avoid an increase in ‘ sick shutdowns ’ , on some of its most vomit - inducing rides and attractions			1
those who have more than 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath will then be fast - tracked onto the park ’s proven hangover - busting rides , and turned away from others until they are feeling perkier			0
the move will hopefully appease families , who will no longer be forced to wait while rides are closed during clean - up operations			0
@entity20 sends riders shooting through the air head - first down a drop of 39m - but has been found to be the perfect solution to settling queasy stomachs the research , carried out by neuropsychologist dr @entity63 , foundthe blast of oxygen on the high - speed swarm improves drunk riders ' metabolic rate , which boosts speeds at which toxins are broken down			0
@entity71 , divisional director of @entity7 , said : ‘ @entity7 does not condone drinking and riding , however , during this @entity76 period , we realise that a number of our guests do not recognise that they are suffering from the effects of the night before			2
‘ we felt it was our duty to ensure that all of our guests enjoy the extreme nature of our rides and by putting them on @entity20 , which is proven to be the ultimate hangover cure			0
‘ we are confident our guests will have a great , and hopefully vomit - free , day			0
’ @entity7 hopes the move will end years of ' sick shutdowns ' , which force guests to wait while rides are cleaned of vomit			1

@entity7 has seen 250 per cent increase in people being sick during the infamous student ' freshers week '
