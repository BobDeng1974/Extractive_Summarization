reaching more than a thousand feet into the air , the shard was hailed as one of the wonders of the age when it was completed			2
yet @entity7 ’s tallest building is almost entirely empty , as its owners struggle to find buyers and tenants for its offices and luxury flats			1
as our picture shows , @entity15 ’s 72 - storey skyscraper is largely dark in the early evening , while the surrounding buildings are bright with office lights			2
dim prospects : lights blaze out from the viewing gallery but almost all the rest of the @entity0 lies in darkness as evening falls last week - in stark contrast to surrounding businesses almost a year after it opened at a cost of £ 500 million , the building ’s only occupants are a restaurant on the 32nd floor and a viewing gallery on the upper five floors , which offers visitors stunning views of the capital for £ 25			1
not a single office in the 26 floors devoted to business use has been rented			2
high rents and economic stagnation have been blamed for the slow take - up – but other experts believe the problem is more fundamental : location , location , location			2
the @entity0 is to the south of the @entity50 , across the river from the financial institutions of the @entity53 who would be its target tenants			1
@entity55 used : the building 's only occupants are a restaurant on the 32nd floor and a viewing gallery on the upper five floors , which offers visitors views of the capital for £ 25 business sense : not a single office in the 26 floors devoted to business use has been rented , with high rents and economic stagnation blamed for the slow take - up a room with a view : @entity7 's tallest building offers views across the capital , but experts believe it is struggling to find tenants because of its location south of the @entity50 in contrast , in two other skyscrapers – nicknamed @entity75 and the @entity76 – more than half the floor space has already been let , even though they are still under construction			1
but these both lie in the @entity81			2
@entity82 , an office leasing agent at estate agency @entity83 , said : ‘ it ’s been marketed as an iconic central @entity15 tower , priced like the @entity87			2
' for people to locate south of the river the developers are asking quite big rents			1
’ contrasting popularity : @entity15 's newest skyscrapers nicknamed the @entity94 , left , and the @entity76 , right a 205 - room five - star hotel will open in @entity0 in the summer , but it will still leave empty almost 600,000 sq ft of office space on the first 28 floors			1
ten luxury flats with price tags of up to £ 50 million also remain unoccupied , although the building ’s @entity101 owners say they will not be put on sale formally until the hotel underneath them opens			1
@entity107 chairman sir @entity106 , who has been forthright in his criticism of the ‘ egomaniacal architecture ’ of the @entity0 , said the building was unsuitable for businesses because the offices were ‘ the wrong shape ’			1
the former editor of the @entity115 said : ‘ it is very inefficient per square foot , because of things like lifts and so on			2
' they are not a very attractive proposition			0
office blocks across @entity15 are empty			0
' it ’s entirely speculative , you hope one day it will be filled			0
’ he added that few super rich inhabitants would ever end up actually living in the apartments in the shard			0
‘ they are just bank accounts in the sky , ’ he said			0
‘ nobody wants to live in these places , they are buying them as investments			0
’ however , letting agent @entity82 believes that the shard will be ‘ in a better position ’ to attract businesses once surrounding development work is also finished			0
talks are currently under way that , if successful , will see at most a quarter of the space in the @entity0 being taken up			1
but although the empty floors may be embarrassing , the building ’s owners have deep pockets and are believed to be comfortable about waiting until the @entity87 economy picks up			1
the building , at @entity151 station , was financed by the oil - rich gulf state of @entity101 , which has wide interests in @entity7 , with stakes in @entity155 ’s , @entity156 , the @entity158 development and @entity159 , among others			0
grand opening : the mayor of @entity15 , @entity163 , pictured with developer @entity164 , cuts a ribbon at the opening of the shard viewing gallery light show : the @entity0 has been marketed as an iconic central @entity15 tower , priced like the @entity87 daredevil : the @entity171 took part in a charity abseil down the building in september last year the lack of tenants also gives developers @entity179 another problem , as they will be liable for the annual business rates of up to £ 12 million due to @entity181 , that would usually be paid by the businesses occupying the site			1
@entity179 say they are in talks over the bill – as the council decides when to start imposing the rates			0
‘ paying rates could be up to two years away , ’ a @entity0 source insisted			1
in a statement , the company said : ‘ the offices have not yet been rated			0
we are in discussion with the local authority as to when an appropriate date will be determined for rating purposes			0
the rating value is not confirmed			0
’ under construction : a view of the @entity0 , taken in january last year while building was underway window to the world : the glass frontage being added to the core of the building , situated near @entity151 the @entity0 is not the only @entity15 block to be struggling to find tenants			1
a building above @entity210 station is only now on the point of signing its first deal , 18 months after it was completed			0
and it took a reported 15 years to fill 1 @entity214 , the tower at the centre of the @entity158 development , which was also built in the midst of a downturn , in 1991			0
scaling new heights : workmen perched 985 feet above the ground at @entity0 building during construction in @entity15			1

just six of its 72 floors in use after owners struggle to find buyers and tenants for luxury flats
only occupants are 32nd floor restaurant and a viewing gallery on the upper five floors
the @entity0 is south of the @entity50 , across the river from the *lucrative* @entity53
