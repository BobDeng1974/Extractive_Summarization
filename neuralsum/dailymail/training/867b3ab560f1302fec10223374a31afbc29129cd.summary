by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 had to negotiate ' borderline ' conditions on their way to victory over @entity6 in rain - drenched @entity7 - but afterwards , captain @entity8 was in no doubt they were right to persevere			1
a half - century from @entity10 , and then a one - day international career - best four for 41 for off - spinner @entity12 , helped to deliver a 39 - run success			2
@entity8 knows he , opposite number @entity15 and the umpires might easily have called time on a fixture which got under way five - and - a - half hours late and was then beset by even more rain which reduced it to a @entity24 format			2
new era : @entity8 ( right ) called conditions ' borderline ' as @entity26 ( left ) started with a win but after @entity2 had begun their new era under @entity8 and returning coach @entity26 with a win , the visiting captain insisted everyone involved deserved congratulations for ensuring a sell - out crowd got the spectacle they too deserved			1
' those were borderline conditions to play in , ' he said			1
' but just in a one - off game , with not so much riding on it , i think it was the right decision			1
' i think it would have been wrong if we had n't - and credit to both sides for just getting on with it			1
' @entity8 might easily have left the field earlier than he did during a particularly heavy downpour , but stayed put after he and @entity10 ( 50 ) had shared an opening stand of 83			0
he therefore helped to buy enough time to make sure a result was possible			0
' those conditions are as wet as i have ever fielded in , ' he added			1
eye on the ball : @entity8 made a partnership of 83 with @entity10 before being dismissed for 44 just not cricket : the @entity2 captain said the conditions were ' as wet as i 've ever fielded in ' ' it probably was n't fit to play , if you are being totally honest			1
' i was in standing water at mid off , and there were other patches like that			0
but both sides just got on with it			0
' i thought the way @entity6 fielded , especially in those conditions , was exceptional			1
' @entity2 came through unscathed and with an opening victory to start a summer in which they need to put their miserable @entity71 winter behind them as quickly as possible			1
' i do n't think it was dangerous , no - but it was pretty close to it , ' said @entity8			2
' it was very wet for the bowlers running in , but we just about had enough grip to do it			0
' people still threw themselves around in the field			0
' on top : @entity10 , who made 50 , was the only @entity83 to really strike the ball cleanly a short discussion with the umpires while @entity8 was batting brought the initial outcome that the players remained in the middle			0
' we were asking ' how wet does it have to get ? ' i was actually going to ask for a towel to dry my grip , because i could n't grip my bat			2
' it looked like it was going to stop ( raining ) , but we knew how dangerous it would be and that we might not get back on ( in time )			0
' when the umps came and said ' look , it 's going to take a lot longer to mop up properly - but do you want to just get on with it ? ' @entity15 and his team said ' yes '			0
' @entity2 fell foul later of local boy @entity106 , whose 16 - ball innings of 42 kept @entity6 hopes alive in pursuit of a @entity110 target of 173			1
' he was dangerous , was n't he ? ' said @entity8			2
' the only people who timed the ball were he and @entity114 , and they did it beautifully			0
@entity116 : @entity118 's quickfire innings kept @entity6 in with a chance before @entity2 secured the win celebrations : @entity2 's win was the perfect start for their new coach ' he [ @entity118 ] has got a lovely swing of the bat - and when he hit it , it stayed hit			1
' it was quite hard to keep getting after ' @entity131 ' - he keeps pulling it back a little bit , even when the ball was extremely wet and he was n't getting much grip on it at all			2
' but he [ @entity118 ] was dangerous , and that 's what @entity24 cricket is about			0
one guy can win a game			1
' it would have needed him to get 80 or 90 to do it ... but while he was still in , it was definitely a possibility			0
' @entity106 himself added : ' i 'm quite a confident person when i go into bat			0
' i know i can hit the ball quite cleanly ... and if i am straight i usually connect quite well			0
' he did , but not for long enough to seriously discomfort @entity2 .			1

@entity2 win shortened game to give @entity26 a winning start
@entity152 describes the conditions as ' the wettest i have ever fielded in '
claims the pitch probably was n't fit to play but they wanted to play
