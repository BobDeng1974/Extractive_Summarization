by @entity0 last updated at 1:41 am on 29th september 2011 a sunspot 62,000 miles across - ten times bigger than @entity2 - is releasing gigantic solar flares that have created astonishing light shows over @entity5 , described by one sky - watcher as the best he 'd ever seen			1
known as auroras , they are caused by radiation particles from the sun bouncing off @entity2 's atmosphere and are normally only seen in countries in the far north , such as @entity14			1
however , they 've been photographed as far south as @entity16 and in @entity17 , where the skies became a dramatic green and purple hue			2
purple haze : the incredible light show on monday made @entity17 look more like @entity14 it 's not grim up north : the solar flares transformed @entity5 's northern skies way to glow : the aurora over @entity29 in @entity30 last night a huge green and red aurora was also captured by the @entity32			1
however , the recent solar flares , caused by a sunspot known as ' @entity35 ' , could wreak havoc with electrical communications ranging from handheld electronics such as iphones to sections of the power grid			1
but experts believe the most powerful eruptions have been and gone			2
@entity44 , a scientist at @entity46 ’s @entity45 in @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' the solar wind that was really energised seems to have passed us by			1
' however , solar activity is notoriously unpredictable and the @entity2 is n't out of the firing line just yet			1
astronomer dr @entity53 , ceo of @entity54 , told @entity55 : ‘ @entity35 is the source of all of the auroras , and may well be the source of some more auroras over the next few nights			2
‘ space - weather forecasters estimate a 40 per cent chance of more flares during the next 24 hours			2
any such eruptions would be @entity2 - directed as the sunspot crosses the centre of the solar disk			1
‘ in short , with no moon in the sky , and an active region on the sun , the next few nights might be very interesting for sky - watchers in @entity5			2
’ @entity74 - chaser @entity73 described the lights seen over @entity5 as the most impressive he 'd ever seen			0
on monday he took incredible pictures near the causeway that links the @entity78 with the island of @entity80 , in @entity17			0
he said : ' what made this display really amazing was the colour , it was a fantastic deep purple colour when usually @entity85 are a pale green colour			1
' the reason it was purple is all to do with the composition of the particles from the sun hitting the atmosphere , obviously these were some different kinds of particles			0
red alert : this stunning image from the @entity32 shows a bright green and red aurora over the @entity2 , with the latter colour caused by radiation colliding with nitrogen in the atmosphere hot stuff : the behemoth sunspot 1302 has been unleashing huge solar flares well spotted : astronomer dr @entity53 took this picture of @entity35 1302 in @entity54 ' we set off from @entity107 at around 9pm and then drove an hour north , all the time trying to get a clear view directly north			1
' we needed to find an area without light pollution as well and by the time we reached @entity80 it was about 10.30pm but it was well worth the journey			0
' i have been to @entity14 four times and @entity116 once to see the lights , but this was the best one i have ever seen anywhere			0
' spectacular auroras could be a fairly regular occurrence over the next new years as the sun is currently going through a strong period of activity			0
dr @entity125 from the @entity127 's @entity126 , told @entity55 : ' solar activity rises and falls , with peaks every 11 years			1
we are now on a rise towards the next maximum , which is good news for @entity134 watchers			0
' the next peak is in 2014 , so there should be other chances to see auroras			0
the rate of occurence ( of solar flares ) will certainly increase over the next few years			2
however , you ca n't predict them			0
' a sunspot occurs when strong magnetic fields on the sun reach the surface and cool down , according to @entity148			0
large ones can be seen clearly using telescopes and powerful cameras .			0

' @entity85 ' seen over southern @entity153
bursts of solar radiation could wreak havoc with communication *systems*
