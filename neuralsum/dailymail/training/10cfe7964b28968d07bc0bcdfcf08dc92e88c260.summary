the nationality of each passenger will make a staggering difference to the compensation payments made to the families of the 239 people killed in the crash of flight mh370 , according to legal experts			1
public liability lawyers say the biggest disparity will be the difference between the payouts offered to the relatives of western passengers , compared to those from @entity17 countries			1
@entity19 aviation crash attorney @entity18 said passengers and crew from @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 would fare worse in their claims due to what they are calling a limited view of damages			1
' they could evaluate these cases and say a @entity22 life is ( of ) less value than an @entity19 life			1
that 's unfair and that 's going to cause problems , ' he told @entity37			0
further claims can then be made in any one of five places : the primary residence of the plaintiff , the destination of the flight , where the ticket was bought , where the carrier is domiciled or its main place of business			0
but mr @entity18 warned any major disparity in payouts would lead to international uproar			2
' i would be raising holy hell if i was a family member of a passenger from one country getting less than someone who happened to be sitting next to me from another country , ' he said			2
the lawyer said the airline could pay between $ 500 - 750 million in damages to relatives it was probable it had liability insurance of about $ 1 billion			1
@entity84 ' husband @entity83 was killed when the plane crashed in the southern @entity86			0
the @entity88 couple were based in @entity89 , @entity90 @entity91 , the leader of @entity19 aviation practice @entity92 , said compensation for loss of life would be massively different for @entity19 victims and those from other countries , @entity37 reported			1
ms @entity100 estimated an @entity19 court would pay compensation of between $ 8 - 10 million per passenger , while @entity22 relatives would likely receive less than $ 1 million per passenger			1
most of the people on @entity41 were @entity17 , but relatives are likely to get less compensation because of the legal system in the countries where they are seeking damages in non-common law countries such as @entity22 , where 154 of the missing flight 's 239 passengers were from , the payouts could be minimal due to a ' restrained view of damages ' , according to @entity49 public liability lawyer @entity119			1
he said notions of loss in some @entity17 countries were viewed differently to the west , and this could restrict the way claims are dealt with and also the amount of compensation			0
' the way it 's administered is a matter for that country , ' mr @entity119 told the @entity133			0
' @entity135 law countries have laws that provide different levels or scales for negligence , where as in @entity90 there is no cap , ' he said			0
experts say the disparity in compensation is influenced by a ' restrained view of damages ' in non-common law countries throughout @entity17 mr @entity119 said in that in @entity90 , where six of the plane 's passengers were from , if fault is alleged by the person bringing the claim , the airline must prove it was not negligent			2
and in those cases , those who suffered loss from an aviation disaster would be able to apply for unlimited compensation			0
' if the plane was n't found or if it did n't enable @entity165 to establish they were n't negligent , they would be exposed to large claims , ' he said			0
but if an airline can prove it was not negligent then victims will only be entitled to what is outlined under the @entity54			2
@entity172 couple @entity171 and @entity173 , pictured , were among the @entity49 who were killed when @entity41 plunged into a remote area of @entity86 @entity175 is the main reinsurer for the missing @entity165 plane and according to @entity177 it has started paying claims in relation to the plane 's disappearance			1
it has been reported that $ us110 million has been placed in an escrow account and the insurance company settled to make hardship payments to the families of those lost			2
@entity165 said it will not consider compensation payouts until what happened aboard the flight is determined , the @entity187 reported			0
authorities believe the plane turned back from its scheduled flight path from @entity194 to @entity195 on march 8 and crashed into the southern @entity86 nearly eight hours later .			0

compensation lawyers expect huge disparity in the payouts to the families of those on board @entity41
the ' @entity54 ' covers all passengers for $ us176 , 000
families of victims can then seek further damages in their home country
it means @entity19 families could get up to $ 10 million per passenger , while @entity49 relatives can seek *uncapped* damages
but @entity22 relatives could get as little as $ 1 million per passenger
lawyers cite *varying* legal systems as the reason for the massive differences in potential claims
