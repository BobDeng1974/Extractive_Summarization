@entity0 today waded into the @entity2 tax avoidance row – after insisting people had the ' right to minimise ' how much they pay			1
the @entity6 mayor said everyone should pay their ' fair whack ' but defended people 's right to limit their ' obligations '			1
his intervention came after @entity13 became embroiled in a furious row with the @entity15 after accusing @entity16 of not caring about tax avoidance because he was ' up to his neck ' in it			1
@entity6 mayor @entity0 said everyone should pay their ' fair whack ' but defended people 's right to limit their ' obligations ' the @entity24 leader accused mr @entity16 of being a ' dodgy prime minister , surrounded by dodgy donors '			1
mr @entity13 pointed the finger at @entity15 peer lord @entity28 – accusing him of being involved in ' tax avoidance activities '			1
in response , lord @entity28 threatened to sue mr @entity13 for libel if he repeated the slur			1
but less than 24 hours later , the former @entity15 treasurer admitted engaging in ' vanilla ' tax avoidance			2
he added : ' tax avoidance , everyone does it			2
' mr @entity13 said lord @entity28 's remarks were an ' extraordinary u-turn ' , adding : ' the thing he objected to was me saying he was engaging in tax - avoiding activities			1
' he denied ever calling lord @entity28 ' dodgy ' – but said there were several other ' questionable donors to the @entity15 '			2
the @entity24 has insisted that any suggestion @entity13 avoided tax was a ' straightforward lie ' when questioned about the row today , the @entity6 mayor @entity0 told the @entity48 : ' i think people have a legitimate right to minimise their tax obligations if they can but they should pay their fair whack			1
i do think it 's important to be transparent			2
' @entity55 added : ' what i would say is nobody willingly pays more tax than they have to and that is certainly true			0
' asked if he had ever taken measures ' to avoid paying tax ' , he said : ' i have never avoided any tax			0
i do n't think i 've ever avoided any tax myself through any complicated measures or in			0
' lord @entity28 has given £ 3million to the @entity68 and held a bank account in @entity70 the row erupted when a list of political donors had bank accounts with @entity76 's private @entity70 banking arm was leaked			1
mr @entity13 jumped on the revelation that many high profile @entity68 were named on the list and yesterday attacked the culture of tax avoidance			1
his remarks sparked accusations of hypocrisy over his own family 's tax arrangements			2
mr @entity13 defended his tax affairs yesterday after being accused of benefiting from a controversial tax - avoidance scheme			1
the @entity24 leader and his family used a ' deed of variation ' to divide the ownership of the family home in @entity6 after the @entity89 's father @entity95 died in 1994			1
these legal documents – which change the terms of someone 's will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance			2
deeds of variation were described as ' tax abuse ' by @entity106 when he was @entity108			0
at an event at his old school , @entity111 in @entity6 , mr @entity13 defended his own complex arrangements			1
asked if he thought it was ' dodgy to use what 's called in the trade a deed of variation , to leave your house to your children that avoids tax ' , the @entity24 leader said : ' the deed of variation issue is something directed at me personally , it 's something that my mother did 20 years ago , that was a decision she made			1
' let me just say this : i paid tax as a result of that transaction , i 've avoided no tax in that			0
no doubt the @entity15 wants to smear mud today but frankly it 's not going to work			0
the story has been written before and i have paid tax on that money			0
' @entity24 today insisted any claim he avoided tax was a ' straightforward lie '			0
@entity76 's private @entity70 bank faces a @entity145 investigation the @entity145 could investigate allegations of tax avoidance at @entity148 - based bank giant @entity76 , deputy governor sir @entity149 indicated today			2
sir @entity149 said the @entity145 was ' not yet ' at the stage of probing the bank 's private @entity70 arm , which is at the centre of claims that it helped customers dodge tax			2
but he admitted the allegations , which have sparked a storm in @entity2 , could be ' of relevance ' to the @entity145 's prudential regulation authority which is responsible for enforcing stability in the @entity148 financial system			0
speaking to @entity166 's today programme , sir @entity149 said : ' i think the allegations around @entity76 raise serious issues around @entity76 's conduct			0
' we 'd expect the management , the leadership of a large group , to be able to ensure that there is a culture and the operations within that group to manage those sorts of risks			0
' i would n't comment on the case because we are not at that stage yet , but this is certainly something that could be of relevance to us			0
' it came as the former director of public prosecutions , @entity186 criticised @entity190 guidance that @entity148 citizens with @entity70 bank accounts were unlikely to be prosecuted for tax evasion if they co-operated with the authorities			0
sir @entity195 , now a @entity24 parliamentary candidate , said the guidance issued in january 2013 following the signing of the @entity148 - @entity70 tax co-operation agreement , had come just as he was seeking to drive up prosecutions for tax evasion			0
the guidance states that provided an account holder makes either a one - off payment or a voluntary disclosure in relation to their relevant assets and fully co-operates with @entity209 , ' that person is highly unlikely to be subject to a criminal investigation by @entity209 for a tax - related offence for past liabilities ' .			0

the @entity6 mayor said everyone should pay their ' fair whack ' in tax
but mr @entity0 defended people 's right to limit their tax ' obligations '
comes after @entity13 became embroiled in furious row over tax dodging
he said @entity16 was a ' dodgy *pm* surrounded by dodgy donors '
aides likened @entity13 's stance on tax dodging to @entity235 *scandal*
