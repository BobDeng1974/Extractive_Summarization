suddenly , after close to 14 years of international football and just 33 caps , @entity0 is the answer for @entity4			1
he was very impressive against @entity5 in a friendly , true ; and he has been an important influence on @entity8 ’s revival			2
yet it would be unfortunate in the extreme if four consecutive @entity4 managers had all failed to spot a game - changing wizard in their midst			2
@entity0 has made nine competitive starts for @entity4 , and the majority have been ordinary at best			1
he played in the match against @entity19 in the 2006 @entity20 , in which @entity4 were saved by a @entity23 free - kick , and was then dropped and replaced by the more energetic @entity24 for the quarter - final with @entity26			1
@entity0 played against @entity19 at the 2006 @entity20 but was dropped for the quarter - final @entity4 have won just four competitive matches when @entity0 started , including against @entity28 @entity0 ( left ) played in the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity30 which went a long way to @entity4 missing out on @entity32 under @entity33 he started in the disastrous double header of a 0 - 0 home draw with @entity36 followed by a 2 - 0 defeat in @entity30 — the results that effectively cost @entity4 ’s place at the 2008 @entity40			1
he was also part of unconvincing performances in @entity28 and , particularly , @entity43 under @entity44			0
@entity4 have won four competitive games in which @entity0 has started — against @entity19 , and then @entity46 , @entity28 and @entity47 , all at home			1
@entity19 were feisty opponents and @entity0 struggled to match their intensity ; the same in the second half in @entity43 , when @entity4 were overwhelmed and fortunate not to lose			1
the home draw with @entity36 — more than either defeat to @entity30 — was the worst result of @entity33 ’s reign			0
@entity0 was hailed after an impressive performance for @entity4 in their friendly draw with @entity5 last week @entity0 has also been impressive in @entity8 's midfield under @entity59 this season so the idea that @entity4 managers are fools for consistently preferring @entity62 and @entity63 is misguided			1
@entity0 had chances throughout his career , and little changed			0
equally , in less than one year , between may 30 , 2009 , and may 9 , 2010 , @entity63 scored more goals for club and country than @entity0 has in his entire career			1
@entity62 took slightly longer — outscoring @entity0 in entirety between october 24 , 2007 and december 13 , 2008			2
and it was n’t as if @entity63 and @entity62 could n’t pass or put a tackle in , too			2
maybe @entity0 has improved with age			0
maybe he is the best around right now			0
he certainly deserves to be judged on his current performances , not his past			0
just do n’t think that there is n’t a reason why his international career underwhelms			0
they ’re not all idiots , these @entity4 managers .			0

@entity0 impressed during @entity4 's draw with @entity5 last week
but the midfielder has been ordinary in his nine competitive starts
@entity4 won four of those - @entity19 , @entity46 , @entity28 and @entity47
@entity4 *bosses* consistently preferred @entity62 or @entity63
