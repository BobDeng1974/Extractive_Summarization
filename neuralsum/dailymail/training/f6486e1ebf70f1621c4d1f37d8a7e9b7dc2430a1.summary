as any woman knows , a spot of make - up can work wonders by seemingly turning back the clock			2
but exactly how many years does that foundation , mascara and blusher knock off ? now research suggests that when applied well , it can make the wearer look almost a decade younger			0
the beauty myth : respondents to the survey said @entity14 , 51 , looked 53 with no make up , but just 46 - seven years younger - when she chose to wear a full face of cosmetics @entity17 , 54 , took seven years off her ' bareface ' age @entity19 , 49 , lost six years thanks to make - up those who go out in their warpaint appear to be between five and nine years younger than when they are bare - faced			1
@entity24 , 38 , and @entity25 , 51 , were shown to have the most age - reducing regimes , with both looking nine years younger after applying make - up			1
meanwhile , 54 - year - old @entity17 managed to shave seven years off her age and @entity30 , 46 , took off six			0
the research – which you wo n’t be surprised to hear was conducted for a beauty retailer – involved showing respondents images of well - known women , first bare - faced and then with make - up			1
respondents were asked to identify a ‘ make - up age ’ and a ‘ bareface age ’ , with the collective results making an average for each			0
@entity43 , 30 , managed to look five years younger with make - up on			2
@entity19 , 50 , was the only woman whose ‘ bareface age ’ was below her real age at 47 – but with make - up on she looked even younger , at 43			0
respondents were also asked about their own make - up , with 70 per cent of over- 30s saying it makes them look younger			2

only women under 21 thought that a slick of black kohl and some lipstick actually added a few years			0
the survey by @entity67 showed that the older you are , the more reliant you are on make - up to turn back the clock			0
only 60 per cent of those aged 30 to 39 thought they looked younger with make - up , compared with 100 per cent of those aged 60 to 69 .			1
