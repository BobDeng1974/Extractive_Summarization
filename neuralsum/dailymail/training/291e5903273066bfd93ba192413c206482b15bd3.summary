by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 4 january 2013 when photo - sharing website @entity2 banned the use of hashtags using pro-anorexia keywords last april , it was widely praised			1
but now @entity8 eating disorder charity , beat , has spoken out to say the site still is n't doing enough			1
although users attempting to search keywords such as ' thinspiration ' or ' proanorexia ' can no longer do so , more than 300,000 images featuring frighteningly thin women or acts of self harm are still available on the site			1
disturbing : images like this mock - up are frequently found on @entity2 despite removing more than 30,000 graphic photos , the site 's 80 million users can still access ' thinspo ' content simply by using ' eating disorder ' as the search term			1
' it ’s worrying that with the powerful medium of social networking and the growing popularity of phone apps such as @entity2 , people are able to easily access images that encourage the individual to believe that an eating disorder is a lifestyle choice and to avoid treatment , ' a beat spokesperson told @entity37			1
' some sites have acted to remove content that is seen as dangerous and encouraging people to do dangerous things			0
eating disorders as a lifestyle choice should be treated in the same way			0
' following the site 's decision to ban ' thinspo ' content , users of @entity2 are being encouraged to report pro-anorexia content so the website can remove it			1
tragic : @entity52 sisters @entity53 ( left ) and @entity54 died within months of each other due to complications brought on by anorexia ' we wo n’t allow accounts , images , or hashtags dedicated to glorifying , promoting , or encouraging self - harm , ' say the new guidelines			2
' should users come across content of that nature , we recommend flagging the photo or flagging the user as a ' terms of service ' violation for our support team to review			0
' nevertheless , anyone who carries out a quick search of the site today will see that thousands of the disturbing photos are still available , including a shocking image of one user , sicklyskinny 's emaciated rib cage			0
more worryingly still , the image received 64 ' likes ' from users with monikers such as ' pleaseletmebeskinny ' and ' watch_me_be_skinny '			0
@entity2 is n't the only photo - sharing site to have fallen foul of anti-anorexia campaigners			0
@entity86 and @entity87 have both come under fire for allowing picture boards and messages that feature ' pro ana ' content , although the latter has taken steps to prevent ' thinspiration ' being posted			1
although @entity2 has n’t disabled the search function for all eating disorder - related terms , a content advisory warning plus a link to the @entity101 website appears before users are redirected to the photos			1
campaigner : @entity106 model and anorexia sufferer , @entity108 , died of the illness in 2010 - months after appearing in this @entity111 anti-anorexia campaign however , users are still free to post provocative comments that glorify eating disorders and it 's these that beat wants the site to be more proactive about curbing			2
' beat also believes that individuals should be pointed towards pro recovery sites , ' the spokesperson told the @entity37			0
' providing acceptance and support throughout society [ needs to happen ] so that these alternative sites are no longer the only refuge a person feels they can seek			0
' to contact eating disorder chartiy beat please visit www.b-eat.co.uk or call the b - eat helpline on 0845 634 1414			2
