@entity0 is ‘ a democratic , empathetic human being ’			1
he has a ‘ strong personality ’ as well as a ‘ strong philosophy ’ and he believes he can ‘ live up to all the expectations ’			1
and with that unrevealing self - portrait , one of the most significant men in @entity9 sport introduced himself to his public			1
in the week of a compelling @entity15 golf championship and a crucial lord ’s test match , the introduction of the latest manager of @entity13 won an extraordinary share of attention			1
new job : @entity0 leaving for a @entity13 training session in @entity22 unveliing : the new boss with club legend sir @entity24 at his arrival announcement this owes much to the nation ’s ongoing obsession with football but still more to a curious public fascination with events at @entity32			1
@entity33 was playing politics when he described @entity13 as ‘ the biggest club in the world ’			1
but the claim was not entirely laughable , hence the importance of his new post			1
@entity13 ’s recent activities on the field have been wholly underwhelming			2
having won the @entity44 title with an ailing team a year ago , they saw that team fall apart last season , to the extent that they were flattered by finishing seventh			2
even a manager of 23 years ’ experience , a man who has won everything that @entity55 club football has to offer , would be hard - pressed to fashion anything remotely formidable from the prevailing mediocrity			1
but then , we remember their extraordinary resources			2
last week , @entity13 concluded a 10 - year , £ 75million - per - year kit deal with adidas			1
already in place is a seven - year , £ 51m - per - year @entity65 sponsorship , plus a trifling £ 17m - per - year deal with @entity67 for , of all things , their training kit			1
these are merely the highlights , for they are following all manner of lucrative avenues			2
the fact is , they are wading through oceans of bank - notes , enjoying the kind of resources which no @entity9 club have ever experienced			1
some will consider this kind of affluence to be mildly obscene and they may have a point			1
but since wealth ultimately dictates results , sooner or later @entity13 will get things right , and the consequences will be dramatic			2
out for a stroll : @entity90 and @entity91 lead the way as @entity13 head for training touching down : @entity13 's players step off the plane in @entity98 airport will @entity33 be the man to deliver the required results ? clearly , nobody knows ; equally clearly , it does not matter			1
for the fact is that @entity13 have ceased to be the football club that we all knew and many loved			1
instead , they are a corporation who regard football as their ‘ core business ’ but who have a whole stream of alternative activities , all producing profits for the @entity113 family of @entity114 , @entity115			2
in this corporation , @entity33 effectively serves as chief executive ( football )			1
if his division produces results , all well and good			2
if those results should falter — and we are talking months rather than seasons — then he will be replaced			2
his last two jobs , with @entity124 and the @entity126 national team , each lasted for two years			2
although he has signed a three - year contract with @entity13 , it seems highly unlikely that he will see it through to the end			1
for scrutiny will be intense , the pressures will be unrelenting and his principal employers — none of whom could ever be mistaken for a ‘ football person ’ — will be intolerant of anything save overwhelming success			2
he understands how the executive game is played and we may be sure that his contract will insulate him from the perils of premature redundancy			2
even so , he will not be at @entity32 for the long term			2
beach boys : @entity13 's players took a stroll on @entity150 beach in @entity22 sights and sounds : @entity153 and @entity154 take in the picturesque scenery as they stroll he will not be given time to identify and cultivate young talent and he would not expect such indulgence			2
instead , he will be asked to supply titles and trophies to order			2
and should he fail , then he will be treated like any other executive who misses his sales targets			2
such is the way in which modern corporations are run			0
just 14 months have passed since sir @entity167 departed the manager ’s office and already the memories are sepia - tinted			1
which is not to say that he will not do an efficient job , however brief his tenure			0
an untalented man could not have won titles in @entity126 , @entity177 and @entity178 , nor could he have handled his country ’s @entity180 efforts with such energy and flair			1
he will upset a good many players and staff , he will fall out with referees and opposing managers on a regular basis and when the axe falls , he will doubtless blame the media			0
but while he is there , he will know where his loyalty lies			0
not to the 75,731 who fill the stadium every other week ; cheering and singing and creating that raucous atmosphere which television finds so appealing			0
not to the legions of disenfranchised @entity13 fans , remotely following every pass and tackle			0
certainly not to any romantic notion of the men who built the club ; from @entity204 , @entity205 and the @entity206 , through to @entity207 and @entity208			1
no , @entity0 must serve a more demanding constituency , one composed of adidas , @entity65 , @entity67 and that folksy , down - home family from @entity114 , @entity115			1
in short , he must place himself at the mercy of the balance sheet , as befits a chief executive ( football )			0
by that test , the young @entity167 would have lasted about six months			0
we must hope that @entity13 ’s latest ‘ democratic , empathetic human being ’ stays around for a little longer			0
@entity221 were a class apart however much some of us wanted to see @entity225 lift the @entity180 , the trophy ultimately came to rest in the most deserving hands			1
@entity178 ’s power and class set them apart from their challengers			1
yet only in the week following the final did we learn the true extent of that class			0
there was the training centre they built in the fishing village of @entity239 in @entity241 state , their constructive contributions to the local economy and the efforts they made to socialise with the local people			0
class apart : @entity178 's stars celebrating after winning the @entity180 then there was their @entity251 midfielder @entity250 , who had decided to devote a slice of his @entity180 bonus to paying the hospital bills of 11 @entity256 children			1
when @entity178 won the @entity180 , he expanded that number to 23			1
of course , @entity250 and his colleagues can afford such gestures but that is scarcely the point			0
this was a @entity180 held in the spiritual home of the game and @entity178 had recognised the need to honour the occasion by respecting their hosts			1
it was a considerable performance by a remarkable football nation			0
@entity273 @entity272 battles on if you wanted to follow @entity276 ’s progress at @entity15 , then you had to search a long way down the field			1
the false promise of an opening 69 was followed by the cruel reality of a 77 , then a 73 to put him three over			0
he made the cut by a single shot			0
somebody congratulated him and he had the grace to appear embarrassed			0
at such times , we inevitably recall how it used to be , when his touch was impeccable and his game was governed by a fierce rage for perfection			0
@entity273 : @entity276 is battling on at the @entity15 despite a disappointing week even those elders who remember @entity295 and revered @entity296 , @entity297 and the gods of the game had seen nothing quite like him			1
in his days of glory , the majors were reduced to a struggle for second place			0
the winner was predestined , the trophy was spoken for			0
at 38 , he must be aware that such days will never return			0
but he battles on , searching for the spark , with a tenacity which does him great credit			0
as an intensely proud man , @entity276 will neither welcome nor value our sympathy			1
so he must settle for our unbounded admiration			0
@entity316 a drowsy lord ’s afternoon			0
@entity318 are grafting diligently in the heat and sir @entity320 is gossiping with @entity321 , aka ‘ bumble ’ , about the dogs they have owned			0
‘ that one you had , ’ says @entity320 , ‘ the one who used to bite my ankles			0
’ ‘ @entity327 , ’ says @entity321			0
‘ yeah , @entity327 , ’ says @entity320			0
‘ what happened to him ? ’ ‘ he ’s on the mantelpiece , wi ’ me @entity330 , ’ says @entity321			0
truly , there are times when @entity337 ’s admirable cricket coverage seems to have been scripted by @entity338 .			0

@entity33 dealing with kind of money no @entity9 club has ever experienced
@entity178 were well - deserving of their @entity180 triumph
@entity276 may never reach old peaks again as he struggles at @entity348
