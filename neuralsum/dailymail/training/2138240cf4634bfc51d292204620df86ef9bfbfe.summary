the beetle is the first insect proven to use the light of the @entity8 to help steer its course			1
also known as the scarab , the tiny creatures feed on animal droppings , which they fashion into a ball and roll away to a safe spot where it is less likely to be stolen			2
expert navigator : new research has found that scarabs - also known as dung beetles - find their way through their desert habitat by using the stars of the @entity8 as a reference although their eyes are too weak to distinguish individual constellations , scientists found they used the glow of the @entity8 to navigate in a straight line , ensuring they do not circle back to the dung - heap and potential competitors			1
' even on clear , moonless nights , many dung beetles still manage to orientate along straight paths , ' said dr @entity36 from @entity37 in @entity38			1
' this led us to suspect that the beetles exploit the starry sky for orientation - a feat that had , to our knowledge , never before been demonstrated in an insect			0
' field experiments on a @entity49 game reserve showed that the beetles were able to roll their dung balls along straight paths under starlit skies , but not in overcast conditions			1
a species of @entity49 dung beetle used in the experiment , wearing a cardboard mask to block its view of the sky the lighter band of the @entity8 's edge : while unable to pick out constellations , the scarabs could detect the light arcing over their heads for the tests , the beetles were fitted with tiny cardboard caps to alter their field of vision			1
they were placed in a circular arena surrounded by a metre - high black cloth , making it impossible for them to see landmarks			0
with no moon , it took much less time for the beetles to roll a dung ball from the centre of the arena to the edge when they were able to see the sky			0
when they could not look up , the time taken increased from 40 seconds to 124 as they wandered aimlessly around			0
the experiment was repeated in a @entity90 planetarium , with similar results			0
the beetles performed equally well under a full sky of stars , and when only the glow of the @entity8 was visible			1
most stars would be too dim for the beetles â€™ tiny compound eyes to see , said the researchers			0
while unable to pick out constellations , the scarabs could detect the light of the @entity8 arcing over their heads			1
' this finding represents the first convincing demonstration for the use of the starry sky for orientation in insects and provides the first documented use of the @entity8 for orientation in the animal kingdom , ' the researchers wrote in the journal @entity116			2
previously only birds , seals and humans were known to navigate by the stars			0
dung beetles also use the sun and moon as compass cues , said the scientists			0
they added : ' although this is the first description of an insect using the @entity8 for their orientation , this ability might turn out to be widespread in the animal kingdom			2

the scarab uses the light of the @entity8 to keep a straight course
they do so to avoid rolling their balls of dung in a circle - which might bring them into *contact* with rivals who want to steal it
