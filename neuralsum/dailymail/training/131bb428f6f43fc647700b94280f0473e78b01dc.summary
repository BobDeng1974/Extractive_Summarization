by @entity0 published : 05:54 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 29 july 2013 another day , another wave of @entity3 rumours - this time about the potential demise of the @entity6			1
a @entity8 source claims the company will stop making its current flagship phone when it releases its upcoming , rumoured , @entity13 and @entity12 models			1
the reports claims @entity3 wants to focus its attentions on , and ultimately promote more sales of , the newer designs			1
these rumours come at the same time @entity3 is said to be having production difficulties with the new phones , in particular the @entity13 , meaning the release date could be pushed back to the end of september			1
a @entity8 source claims @entity3 could discontinue its @entity6 , pictured , to focus solely on the upcoming , rumoured , @entity13 and @entity12 models			1
this could be in a bid to boost sales of the newer designs @entity8 site @entity30 believes @entity3 could discontinue the @entity6 to focus solely on its rumoured , upcoming new models			1
earlier this year , industry analyst @entity33 from @entity34 claimed @entity3 was working on a low - cost handset			2
dubbed @entity37 or @entity12 , the new handset could come in a range of colours , be made of plastic , have a 3.5inch screen and a @entity43 camera			1
prices being quoted range from £ 63 ( $ 99 ) to £ 260 ( $ 400 )			0

this would make a jumbo @entity65 more than three inches bigger than the current model			0
@entity8 site @entity68 claims that the touchscreen technology currently used on the @entity6 is ' not suitable for low - volume production '			2
this means that when fewer people are buying the @entity6 because new models are on the market , @entity3 will potentially spend more money on production costs than they make back in sales			1
@entity3 is expected to therefore abandon production of the @entity6 , focusing on the high - end successor as well as the rumoured cheaper , plastic model dubbed the @entity37 or @entity12			1

the model was expected to launch on 13 september , with the @entity12 due at the start of october			2
this delay could see the cheaper iphone released before the high - end model			0
the @entity13 is expected to have a fingerprint scanner and an updated camera and it may be these new features that are causing the delays			1
accessory manufacturer @entity117 published a picture of a cheap , plastic @entity6 model earlier this year			2
the design is rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and @entity43 camera and could cost as little as £ 63 ( $ 99 ) @entity3 is rumoured to be working on an @entity13 , due to launch in september , as well as cheaper , plastic models dubbed @entity12			1
