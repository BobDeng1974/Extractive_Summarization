by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:40 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 4 september 2012 a major operation was under way last night to remove the bodies of 17 pilot whales which died in a mass stranding off the coast			1
the whales , including three calves , perished despite hours of frantic efforts by rescue workers to keep them alive until they could be released back out to sea			2
the stricken animals were hosed down and covered in wet blankets and sheets for several hours to try to cool them down and keep them hydrated until high tide			0
they were re-floated , but one more of the group died yesterday on rocks nearby			2
last night the remaining nine were seen off @entity41 , heading westwards			0
this is shallow water where they may be gathering strength following their ordeal			2
but rescuers warned of a great risk to the whales if they remained there at low tide and were hoping they would head north to deeper waters			2
an investigation is under way to try and find out what caused the whales to beach			2
shocking : the scene of horror that greeted rescuers was described as ' like an aircraft crash ' as more than a dozen whales lay dead on the beach near @entity26 off the coast of @entity28 mr @entity64 , who was among 50 people who helped rescue and re-float the 10 whales , said : ' it has been quite traumatic for the pod , members of every generation have gone and they will have to re-build their pod			1
' i would imagine there would be a period of grieving , they are very intelligent animals and they will possibly grieve			0
' he added : ' they are very sociable animals and they have a very , very tight family bond and if one comes ashore they will all come ashore			0
' he said : ' the pod will always try to protect its sick , it 's a natural instinct for a sick whale to come ashore , we think , as they ca n't lift their head to breathe in the water , and if they 're on land they do n't need to struggle			1
it 's only a theory			0
but the rest of the pod will follow suit			0
they are very sociable animals			0
' mr @entity64 said the pilot whales , some of which were 20 - feet long , can only survive for about 12 hours on the shore before they start to die			1
he explained : ' beyond 12 hours they are no longer viable , their muscles break down and that releases toxins in their internal organs			0
' he said : ' it was mayhem , we had to forget the dead ones and concentrate on what we could save			0
they seemed to sense that we were there to help them			0
they never showed any aggression			0
help : members of the emergency services attempt to refloat pilot whales after they beached near @entity26 off the coast of @entity28 ' once we righted them they were okay			1
they swam away so fast we could n't keep up with them			2
' vets used wet blankets and sheets to keep the 10 whales alive , give them shade and keep them cool			1
two breached again but were re-floated by scores of volunteers			0
the @entity132 said in a statement this morning : ' all ten whales have now been reported as having left the harbour			1
the two that had turned back re-stranded but @entity132 volunteers were able to get them straight back into the water			2
' one was in difficulty and listing to one side , but the whales from the main pod swam beside it , physically keeping it upright until it could right itself			2
once it was balanced and able to swim without support , the pod all swam strongly out towards open water			2
' it is hoped that they will turn north soon to return to the deeper water but observers along the southern coast of the @entity157 are on alert if they are seen again			2
' lifesavers : teams of specialist vets steer a stranded pilot whale towards deeper water post-mortem examinations will now be carried out to find out what caused them to come ashore			1
a coastguard spokesman said : ' vets from the @entity169 were at the beach last night and will come back this morning to carry out post-mortem examinations on the dead whales to try to find out what caused them to come in to shore			1
' they will be looking to see if any of the whales were ill or injured and came to shallow water for a rest			1
once they have found out what they can it will be up to the council to remove the carcasses from the beach			0
' @entity186 was alerted to the incident shortly after 7am , with initial reports suggesting a mass stranding of dolphins			0
teams of volunteer medics from @entity132 were sent to the area , with specialist rescue pontoons being moved to the location from across @entity36 , @entity196 and @entity197			2
frantic efforts : emergency services attempt to rescue a large number of pilot whales who became stranded major operation : dozens of specialist vets waded into the water in an attempt to refloat some of the surviving whales ordeal : despite the best efforts of emergency services sixteen of the whales which beached did not survive their ordeal @entity214 , area co-ordinator for the @entity132 , said the scene was ' like an aircraft crash			1
' the group of 26 pilot whales became stranded at @entity26 , near @entity219 , @entity36 ' it was like an aircraft crash scene			1
we had 24 medics here with our pontoons , there are four vets , @entity227 , police , coastguards - everybody did everything they could to save those whales			1
' pilot whales have a habit of beaching			1
one strands and the others tend to stick together			0
' a further 24 pilot whales , possibly from the same pod , were in the shallows three miles along the coast at @entity242 , but have not been seen this morning and are not stranded			1
mr @entity64 said : ' we are monitoring them - but they have not stranded			2
' it has been a fantastic effort by what seems hundreds of people			0
' we managed to herd the pilot whales back out to sea using our pontoons			1
two came back but we have got them out again			0
' we are hopeful all the ten will survive - but i would say the chances are 50 - 50			0
it is up to the animals now			0
people here certainly could n't have done more - they were magnificent			0
' the incident drew a large number of bystanders to the scene , prompting the coastguard to urge the public to stay away to allow rescue teams to carry out their duties			0
many people volunteered to help but were told they could not because of health and safety reasons			0
coastguard teams from @entity219 and @entity271 , @entity273 lifeboat , and @entity274 also assisted with the incident			1
drama : crowds gathers to watch the drama unfold as rescuers battled to save the rest of the pod which had stranded at low tide near @entity26 off the coast of @entity28 carnage : rescuers were confronted with a grim scene of more than a dozen dead whales - including several young calves - on a beach at @entity26 , near @entity219 rescue bid : vets from @entity293 divers and @entity132 were in a race against time to save as many of the beached whales as possible in july last year 70 pilot whales that stranded in the @entity298 in @entity299			1
the @entity300 probed the cause of what is believed to have been @entity36 's largest ever beaching of pilot whales			1
some 25 of the 70 whales died			0
in may last year , around 60 pilot whales appeared in @entity306 , @entity307 , although they left the loch after one of the mammals died			1
another dead whale was later found on an island in the loch			0
a post-mortem examination suggested the first had died of infection			0
at the end of october in 2010 , other pilot whales almost got stranded in @entity306			1
less than a week later 33 whales , believed to be the same group , were found dead on a beach in @entity321 in @entity322			1
pilot whales are known to prefer deep water but come inshore to feed on squid , their main food			1
fraught efforts : teams of specialists tried to keep the stranded mammals alive while pontoons were being deployed to the area to re float them battle : experts fear the final death toll could rise above 13 - despite the valiant efforts of vets			1

only 10 whales survived from the group of nearly 30 pilot whales stranded at @entity26 , near @entity219
the whales were *spotted* off the @entity348 this morning and are being monitored to make sure they stay in deep water
more than 50 medics and emergency crews worked around the clock to refloat the stranded mammals
experts said the whales were n't aggressive and ' sensed ' the vets were there to help them
