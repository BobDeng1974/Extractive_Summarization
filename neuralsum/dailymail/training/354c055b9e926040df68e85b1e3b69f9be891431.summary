spacewalking astronauts routed cables outside the @entity2 on saturday , a tricky and tiring job that needs to be completed before new @entity5 - made crew capsules can dock			1
it was the first of three spacewalks planned for @entity9 astronauts @entity10 and @entity11 over the coming week			1
altogether , @entity10 and @entity12 have 764 feet of cable to run outside the space station			2
the longest single stretch , for installation saturday , was 43 feet			1
@entity9 considers this the most complicated cable - routing job in the 16 - year history of the space station			1
equally difficult will be running cable on the inside of the complex			2
the extensive rewiring is needed to prepare for @entity9 's next phase 260 miles up : the 2017 arrival of the first commercial spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the orbiting lab. ' @entity47 : ' saturday 's spacewalk was the first for @entity11 , flight engineer , who arrived at the space station in late november , when he floated above the @entity46 he said ' pretty cool ' @entity9 : @entity9 is paying @entity52 and @entity53 to build the capsules and fly them from @entity55 , which has n't seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011 @entity9 is paying @entity52 and @entity53 to build the capsules and fly them from @entity55 , which has n't seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011			1
instead , @entity60 is doing all the taxi work — for a steep price			2
the first of two docking ports for the @entity52 and @entity53 vessels — still under development — is due to arrive in june			0
even more spacewalks will be needed to rig everything up			0
there were so many cables — up to 10 on saturday to deal with — that @entity9 color - coded them			1
that helped the spacewalkers only so much ; they expected a lighter blue for one of the lines			0
' i worked up a lather on that one , ' @entity10 informed @entity80			0
after successfully attaching the first four cables , he added , ' i 've got to cool down			2
' @entity82 : astronauts @entity10 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) began the first of three jobs saturday morning in preparation of space taxis difficult : @entity9 considers this the most complicated cable - routing job in the 16 - year history of the space station it was the first spacewalk for @entity11 , who arrived at the space station in late november			1
he savored the moment as he floated out high above the @entity46			0
' pretty cool , ' he said			0
the second spacewalk will be wednesday and the third on march 1			1
spacesuit concerns stalled the work by a day			0
@entity9 wanted to make certain that the suits worn by @entity10 and @entity12 had reliable fan and pump assemblies			0
two other fan - pump units failed aboard the space station in recent months and were returned to @entity102 earlier this month for analysis			2
@entity104 was discovered , the result of water intrusion from testing .			0

@entity113 @entity112 and @entity11 are *tackling* the job that needs to be completed before new @entity5 - made crew capsules can dock
