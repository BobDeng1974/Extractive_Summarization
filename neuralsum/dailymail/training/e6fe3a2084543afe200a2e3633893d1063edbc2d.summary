@entity8 , an underground railway , was abandoned in 2003 , but now an architect firm has come up with an idea to transform the space into a subterranean mushroom garden			1

scroll down for a video about @entity8 life underground : @entity14 is designed to be an urban experience where visitors can embark on an expedition underground , entering and exiting the tunnels from street level hidden network : until 2003 , @entity8 , an underground railway carried 7 million letters and parcels across @entity2 each year until 2003 , @entity8 , carried 7 million letters and parcels across @entity2 each year			1
the underground unmanned train service started in 1927			1
travelled 23 miles of 2ft gauge track linking @entity35 in the @entity36 with @entity37 in west @entity2			0
initially the mail rail line ran 22 hours a day , its staff working in three shifts			1
this service was later reduced to 19 hours a day , 286 days a year			0
its closure came when @entity44 announced the line had become uneconomical with losses of £ 1.2m a day and that they planned to close it should no alternate uses be found			1
the innovative idea claimed @entity50 architects first place in the @entity53 competition which aims to find imaginative new green space in the capital			1
the experience would be lit at street - level with sculptural glass - fibre mushrooms			0
@entity59 said : ' the tunnels provide the ideal environment for an urban mushroom farm with the introduction of daylight through a series of sculptural glass - fibre ‘ mushrooms ’ at street level			0
' ' these will highlight the route of the tunnel above ground and will convey daylight to the tunnels below through punctures along their length			0
' the produce will serve new pop - up concept ‘ @entity81 ’ restaurants and cafés at each entrance			0

runner - up in the competition was claimed by the ' @entity120 ' which would create a special commuter lane in @entity99 , which spans @entity2			2
high , @entity122 , @entity123 and fluid lines : a commuter cycleway on raised railway viaducts , ¿ air rail ¿ gardens by railway sidings , a new green @entity130 and flower shows on the @entity132 @entity133 : establishes small book exchanges within parks and green spaces , and traces the invisible network and movement of books and people @entity141 : a scheme to transform @entity2 's flyovers into productive and beautiful green arteries , to reduce heat effect and traffic noise and encourage biodiversity ' we thought that another new open space was a little redundant - the problem is those spaces are underused , ' said @entity152 of @entity153 , which developed the idea			1
' we would create a network to link those areas together			0
' the obvious thing was the @entity99 - it runs through @entity2 , but is sporadically used , and is rarely used in its entirety			0
the judging panel , included @entity160 and @entity161 , co-founders of @entity163 ’s @entity53 , dr @entity164 , director of @entity166 , @entity165 , head of design for @entity2 , and leading landscape architects @entity169 and @entity170			0
@entity171 : creates mini orchards around bus shelters , featuring beehives within the trees and sloping sedum roofs to collect fruit and rainwater structure : @entity181 ' mats ' and ' sleeves ' are layered onto buses , trams and trains to create mobile gardens barge walk : connects people with water via the creation of a linear park , farm and wetland on floating barges at the edge of @entity196 @entity197 : create a ' rain farm ' in the @entity197 to store run - off and rainwater to serve the local neighbourhood mr @entity160 , co-founder , @entity202 said : ' between the ‘ @entity14 ’ and ‘ @entity96 ’ proposals and the three highly commended entries , the competition puts forward a group of creative ideas that are in some cases fantastic , in others realistic			2
' they all have the power to help us look at @entity2 and green infrastructure in innovative and unexpected ways			2
' although the ideas are all at a design stage , many supporters of the winner and runner - up are calling for them to become a reality			2
the @entity53 competition was inspired by @entity163 ’s popular @entity53 urban park , situated on a disused elevated railway road .			1
