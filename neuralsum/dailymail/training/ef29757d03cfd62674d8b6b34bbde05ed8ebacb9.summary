@entity0 insisted he would be leading @entity1 at next year ’s @entity2 — despite falling for just one run as @entity4 clinched the one - day series in @entity6			1
@entity0 ’s latest failure with the bat was part of a dismal 90 - run defeat for @entity1 , who now trail 4 - 2 in this seven - match series			1
he also dropped a crucial catch , putting down @entity14 on 41			1
the @entity4 batsman went on to make a match - winning 112			1
@entity0 says his dropping of @entity4 's @entity14 on 41 was a ' really costly drop ' @entity0 takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the @entity1 captain in the sixth odi @entity0 , the @entity1 captain , said : ‘ days like these do n’t make the job any easier			1
it ’s tough , not scoring the runs i ’d like			2
it ’s not a great place to be as a captain			2
i ’m a better player than i ’m showing at the moment			0
i ’ve just got to keep going			0
’ @entity0 , who averages 17 in this series and has made only one half - century in his last 21 one - day innings , was confirmed as @entity2 captain a week ago and seems to be in no mood to relinquish the job			1
but when coach @entity38 was asked by @entity39 to confirm @entity0 ’s captaincy , he said : ‘ we review everything at the end of every series			2
we ’ve always said that			0
‘ we make no bones that we ’re passionate to try to get our best side to go out and win a @entity2			0
@entity0 needs runs but he ’s also had some great times as an @entity1 player			1
he ’s in a tough patch but that ’s something he ’s working hard to get out of			0

@entity14 , dropped by @entity0 at mid off on 41 , hit a run - a - ball 112 at the @entity65 in his last one - day international on his home ground			1
it set up a 90 - run success which consigns @entity1 to a series defeat with one match to play			1
@entity0 said afterwards on @entity39 : ' it did n't help , me dropping " sanga " on 40 was a really costly drop ' that was a really big catch to drop at that time because we 'd built up quite a lot of pressure on them			1
' it was probably a 260 ( run ) wicket and credit to him , he made us pay for that			0
' after putting down @entity14 , who got 112 , @entity0 was out lbw to @entity83 for just one @entity1 coach @entity84 said : ' we felt we could draw the series level today but we 've been outplayed in all departments			1
' we probably bowled our best up front			0
towards the end our plans have to be a bit clearer , a bit simpler			0
not just bowling yorkers but matching the ball you bowl to the field you 've got , although the yorker is still a great ball if you bowl it well			0
' we made some errors and did n't field as well as we could have			0
' @entity4 captain @entity101 said : ' it was a challenging wicket to bat on but ' @entity104 ' was amazing once again			2
' together with ( @entity107 ) @entity106 , they were brilliant and set the tone for us to launch at the end			0
' the older he ( @entity14 ) gets , the more runs he scores			2
' @entity14 himself added : ' it 's great to have grown up in @entity54 and gone to school here ... to play one of my last games here is a special feeling			2
