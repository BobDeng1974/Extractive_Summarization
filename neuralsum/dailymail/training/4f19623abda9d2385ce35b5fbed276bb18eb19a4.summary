by @entity1 correspondent learning from others : chimps learn how to peel and break into fruit from watching others , scientists found it is not just humans who are fascinated by watching others cook – chimps also pick up tips on how to prepare food			1
a study found that just as people learn new cookery techniques by watching celebrity chefs , chimps learn how to crack and peel fruit by studying their companions			1
researcher @entity19 said : ‘ it is almost like they are watching the top chef and picking up information			2
’ learning from others is an important part of building up cultural traditions – an ability thought of as being fundamentally human			0
however , the @entity29 research suggests that it may actually date back more than six million years , to the time when chimps and humans shared a common ancestor			1
the researchers videoed three groups of chimps as they were fed hard - shelled fruit in a @entity38 wildlife orphanage			1
the creatures used six different techniques to access the fruit ’s flesh , including cracking two fruits together , banging the fruit on the ground and taking a small bite to get the peeling process started			2
the favoured techniques differed across the groups			0
for instance , the banging two fruits together was used by two of the groups but not a third			0
each group contained members from around @entity56 , meaning their behaviour couldn ’ t be explained by genetics			0
and as the various groups could n’t see each other and they were n’t taught how to eat the fruit by their keepers , it is thought that they were learning through observing others – a key part of establishing cultural traditions and differences			2
mr @entity19 , a psychologist , said : ‘ culture is a hallmark of the human species			0
watch and learn : humans learn how to cook from watching celebrity chefs like @entity73 , pictured			0
it seems the technique can also be observed in chimps linking the species ‘ as humans we might learn the best way to crack a nut or stone a peach form watching someone lese and it appears chimpanzees learn how to handle their food in similar ways			1
’ the study , published in the journal @entity91 , also revealed that some of the chimps stockpiled peeled fruit to eat later			1
the self - control and mental ‘ time - travel ’ involved in planning a future meal suggest the creatures are capable of complex thought .			0

chimps learn about preparing fruit from watching friends , study shows
researchers from @entity29 videoed the chimps
showed them picking up different techniques and learning from others
