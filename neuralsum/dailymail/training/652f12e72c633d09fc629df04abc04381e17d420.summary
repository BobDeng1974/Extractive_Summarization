by @entity0 and @entity1 it is a quintessential @entity3 story			0
while hundreds of thousands of oblivious commuters flit their way back and forth across the mighty steel frame of the @entity8 - homeless people are quietly burrowing into the girders and making it their home			1
at least two squatters have managed to build ' coffin - sized living spaces ' below the upper deck 's car lanes , adjacent to the subway and above bike lanes			1
they are near to the entrance of the bridge , but far enough up the bike path to make accessing them precarious			1
dwelling : this is ' @entity23 - seen in daylight in the @entity8 each of the cramped homes are around ten feet - by - one - and - a - half feet and seem to be protected with bike locks			1
the tiny , narrow dwellings are just big enough for one person to lie down , but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements			1
they do not provide much more			0
the @entity34 attempted to contact either of the bridge - dwellers , but they did not respond			0
the living spaces provide little silence as loud subway trains rumble by on four different tracks , 24 hours a day			2
cars and trucks also scream across the bridge almost non-stop , wind howls over the span - the city that never sleeps does it 's best to keep the squatters awake			0
though hidden in plain sight , most people riding their bikes across the iconic span had idea the homes were there			2
not a single person asked by @entity34 knew of the micro living spaces when asked if they could spot them			2
several expressed shock over their existence			0
precarious : the homes are perched in a narrow space between girders secret : his home is accessed by climbing over the steel railings to seen in the image and up and inside the girders not bothering anyone : some enterprising vagrants are turning @entity3 's @entity8 into a rent - free residence using only plywood and ingenuity the spot they are located in is a rather dangerous , and is at a point in the bike path that is poorly lit and well - trafficked			1
bikers sped down the narrow pathway because people do n't usually walk on it - there is a pedestrian walkway on the opposite side of the span			1
it is not meant to be walked			0
the squatters likely picked this spot because it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof			1
there is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway			2
not only is climbing the fence to the homes dangerous , but walking to them is putting one 's life at risk , especially after the sun goes down			0
the @entity103 reports that one bridge - dweller , a middle - aged @entity106 man , locks his plywood ' door ' with a bicycle lock each morning and returns for the evening to sleep			1
to reach the dwelling , which is built into the bridge frame on the @entity8 side of the bridge , he climbs a chain - link fence			1
poorly lit : there is no lighting in the homes , and there is also no silence @entity121 : hundreds of thousands of people commute by the makeshift home each day without realizing what is going on above their heads prime real estate : the dwellings are built into the upper deck of the bridge , below car traffic but above the subway last sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper , calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide			2
he was yanked off the fence by police and questioned , finally managing to convey in his limited @entity141 that he was n't trying to jump , but was merely returning home			0
the @entity143 declined to comment to @entity34 regarding the dwellings , and the @entity145 has yet to return a message left seeking comment			0
' people are really desperate for places to stay			2
i say , if he ’s not bothering anybody , he ’s not bothering me			0
leave him alone , ' @entity153 , a passerby riding her bike near the shantytown told the @entity103			0

homeless people are constructing dwellings in the @entity8
vagrants are using plywood to convert narrow spaces in a small expanse of the roof over the bike path into places to sleep
the noisy , cramped *quarters* are hard to enter and dangerous to walk to
