@entity1 manager @entity0 accepted his side were ' a bit lucky ' after a fumble from @entity6 goalkeeper @entity5 handed them a 2 - 1 extra-time victory and a place in the @entity10 final			1
the @entity11 will head back to @entity12 on may 30 aiming to defend the trophy after edging past the @entity15 side , who had rallied after going behind just before half - time to a fine goal from @entity19			1
@entity6 drew level on 54 minutes when @entity22 's volley was deflected past goalkeeper @entity23 , who could only palm the ball back over the line			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 accepted his side were ' a bit lucky ' to beat @entity6 on saturday @entity0 's side failed to hit the level seen in recent games against @entity6 at @entity12 although @entity1 did twice hit the woodwork through a header from defender @entity34 , which was touched onto the crossbar by @entity5 at full stretch , and a close - range shot by @entity39 , the @entity31 side could not find a winner in normal time			1
in the end , an error from @entity43 @entity5 proved so costly , the keeper allowing a low , angled shot from @entity19 to slip through his legs and roll over the line on 115 minutes			1
' it was a difficult game against a well organised , resilient , committed and physically strong @entity6 team , ' @entity0 said			1
' they really wanted it @entity6 , they were willing to die on the pitch to go to the final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in			1
' in the end , we were a bit lucky because their keeper made a mistake and i can understand that he is distraught , but as well he kept them in the game for long periods			0
' @entity0 added : ' what was missing was a bit of speed of combination and sharpness in the final third maybe , but overall the concentration was there			2
@entity19 's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of @entity6 goalkeeper @entity5 in extra time it was a routine shot from @entity19 but the @entity6 stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe the ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game @entity5 tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp ' i do n't think we switched off ( for the goal ) , but after half - time we did not come on with the same intensity			1
we started to suffer and we paid for that			0
' @entity0 refused to single out @entity23 for blame on the @entity6 goal			2
' i would have to see it again , ' he said			0
' at first i thought it was not in because it took some time for the referee to give the goal , so i thought ' okay , we escaped '			0
@entity107 lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the @entity10 semi-final against @entity1 ' but on slow motion maybe he goes back a bit to save the ball with his feet , then when the ball bounces , it was certainly over the line			2
' we will have to analyse it , but the cross should not have come in and after the guy was free , so it was a combination of mistakes			0
' @entity0 said an ankle injury to defender @entity125 ' does not look good ' , which could make the @entity128 defender a doubt for sunday 's @entity31 game against leaders @entity131 at the @entity132			2
the @entity6 goalkeeper , who had been magnificent until then , left the field in tears as manager @entity136 tries to console him @entity1 reached a record 19th @entity10 final , and will be looking to overtake @entity139 's mark of 11 victories , with five coming under @entity0 's tenure			1
' now , let 's focus on our next game , we come back here in the final , but we have time to prepare , ' @entity0 said			1
' the final is a 50 - 50 ( game )			0
if we can beat the record we will be very happy			0
' let 's hope we have all of our players available and come back in good shape			0
' @entity5 's opposite number , @entity23 ( left ) of @entity1 comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved @entity131 look in a strong position to go on and win the title , having defeated @entity139 1 - 0 at @entity158 on saturday evening			1
@entity0 said he was unaware of the final result when quizzed on its significance at the post-match press conference			2
' i ignore completely what happened			0
@entity131 won 1 - 0 ? the usual , ' the @entity1 boss said			0
' we will see next week			0

@entity1 reached the @entity10 final despite failing to live up to recent form
@entity5 's gaffe was only difference between the sides at @entity12
he let a soft @entity19 effort squirm through his grasp in extra time
@entity0 felt @entity5 kept @entity6 in the game with numerous top saves
