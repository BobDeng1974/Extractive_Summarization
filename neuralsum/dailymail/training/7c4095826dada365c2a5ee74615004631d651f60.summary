by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 15:32 est , 23 january 2013 two children who went missing after apparently running away from home have been found at their local bus station			1
@entity4 , 12 , and her 10 - year - old brother @entity5 disappeared from their home in @entity7 , @entity8 overnight or early this morning			1

but the pair were spotted by a family friend , who alerted the police , and now they are in the process of being reunited with their family			1
as @entity21 searched for them , officers said they were ' very concerned ' about the children 's safety , and warned that they could be at risk from the freezing weather			0
however , their search for @entity5 and @entity4 was complicated by the fact that the local school is closed , making it harder to contact the children 's friends in order to find information on where they might have gone			2
home : the house in @entity7 which the @entity14 children abandoned overnight on tuesday up to 50 officers followed up ' a number of leads ' and checked dozens of address across a wide area			1
' there is now a suggestion that the youngsters may try to travel by train to a previous holiday destination in @entity74 , @entity15 , ' a police spokesman said			1

he is believed to be wearing a black hooded @entity87 jacket with bright yellow lettering , black ankle boots and a cap with ' @entity91 ' on the front			0
@entity93 : police have launched a wide - ranging search for the two youngsters leading the search , inspector @entity97 , of @entity94 , said the disappearance was unusual for the pair			2
he said at the time : ' the children have not been missing before and , although they have packed clothes and taken money , we are very concerned about them , particularly in this cold weather			0
' it is believed they have left of their own accord			0
we are continuing to carry out a number of inquiries to try and locate @entity4 and @entity5 and are being supported by a significant number of force resources			2
