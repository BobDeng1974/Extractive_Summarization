from outside the changing room , it must have sounded as though i was in labour			0
and as i huffed and puffed , i was certainly in agony			0
the green jeans i ’d spotted from @entity7 ’s limited edition range in my size , a 14 , would n’t go past my knees			1
exasperated , i headed out for a 16 — only to find that they would n’t go past my thighs either			0
so i braved the rails again for a size 18			1
what was going on ? in previous weeks , i ’d bought a pair of size 14 trousers and a top from the same shop — and they ’d all fitted			1
while we all know that one make ’s size ten is another ’s 14 , surely in the same shop , you should know what you ’re in for size-wise			0
not in my local @entity7 , which has nine ranges under one roof — and each one seems to have different sizing			2
to find out which one fitted me best , i decided to try on a selection of items — and one size most definitely did not fit all			1
@entity34 size 18 : there ’s more chance of @entity38 ’s @entity37 singing live than me fitting into my usual size 14 on my bottom half in @entity7 ’s limited edition			1
two sizes up , this print skirt ( £ 35 ) slipped on fine			0
@entity44 : ( left ) perhaps because this burgundy pencil skirt ( £ 29.50 ) from @entity7 ’s standard collection is stretchy it fitted @entity48 size 16 was baggy			2
size 16 : ( right ) a rather dull work skirt ( £ 22.50 ) from @entity52 ’s @entity51 tried the 14,but stretched across my thighs it was wrinklier than @entity56 @entity57 size 18 : these are the fateful limited edition jeans ( £ 29.50 ) that upset me in the first place			2
i even thought about trying a 20 , but i just got away with an 18			0
as long as i did n’t sit down			0
size 14 : ( left ) usually i would n’t venture near the @entity61 , which is aimed at the older lady			2
but the stretchy cord material on these trousers ( £ 18 ) as well as an elasticated waist meant i easily fit a size 14			1
size 16 : ( right ) the most comfy and flattering , these dark blue jeans from @entity7 ( £ 39.50 ) felt so good that i ’m going to buy them , even though the label said they are a size bigger than i normally wear			0
@entity71 size 18 : i loved the bottle - green colour of this @entity7 dress ( £ 79 ) but when i tried on the size 14 , i looked like a lumpy courgette			1
the 16 does n’t fare much better but the 18 fitted like a glove size 16 : ( left ) i tried the size 14 of this lace russet dress ( £ 59 ) from the autograph collection first			1
while i could just fit into it , there was only one canape ’s worth of room before it burst			0
the size 16 was perfect size 12 : this black and navy striped dress with zip detail ( £ 45 ) from @entity52 is admittedly a little snug in a size 12 , but the size 14 was too big and baggy at the waist			1
@entity95 size 16 : thanks to its stretchy material , this striped top ( £ 9.50 ) , again from @entity100 , is another i will be buying			0
even if it was a size 16 size 12 : ( left ) my top half has always been smaller than my bottom half , but i was surprised to fit easily into this size 12 top ( £ 25 ) from @entity52			1
size 14 : ( right ) at last , a limited edition piece that fitted in my usual size			2
i loved the collar on this top ( £ 35 ) , but it could do with being a little longer in the body			0

@entity111 is usually a size 14 and yet she *struggles* to find clothes to fit in @entity7
she tries on various items from several different ranges and found she went from a size 12 to a size 18
despite this @entity121 *claims* she will be buying some of the clothes she tried on even if they were *n't* her regular size
