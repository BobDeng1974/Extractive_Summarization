subway service was again free today , but still no service below 34th street by @entity3 reporter published : 19:54 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 3 november 2012 the commute home for millions of @entity5 has been a slow , protracted process , with many stuck in one of the outer boroughs , unable to find a way out			1
more subway and rail lines started operating again friday , and the @entity12 into @entity5 was open to buses			2
but that did little to assuage the massive transit nightmare that has been the past week , as @entity16 shut down subways , buses , and commuter rail ; those braving the mass transit system were today forced to over-crowd into buses and crawling trains			2
gridlock : traffic is gridlocked on the @entity25 after @entity16 commuters formed long lines along @entity28 and @entity29 as @entity5 's @entity30 ( @entity30 ) resumed only a bus service throughout @entity5 but no subway service traffic backs up on @entity34 near the @entity35 , @entity5 , on thursday the @entity30 re-opened parts of two lines , the m and 7 trains , which go from @entity40 into @entity41			1
in addition , limited @entity43 service resumed			0
subway service was again free today , though there was still no service below 34th street			1
in addition , @entity49 trains were running very limited hourly service on four lines , including the @entity52 , @entity54 branch , and @entity55			0
the roads and byways of @entity5 were eerily empty as fuel reserves dwindled , though some two million barrels are expected to be distributed to gas stations around the tri-state area as quickly as possible			0
commuters were also seen forming long lines along @entity28 and @entity29 as they waited for buses though the @entity30 did not charge bus fare , without the subway service , commuters found packed buses and long lines and delays along their commutes yellow cabs were few and far between as they ran out of petrol and were forced to curb their cars			1
in lieu of subways , buses ran along the subway lines , in addition to those running their routes			0
as with yesterday , massive queues formed around hubs like @entity86 ’s @entity85 and @entity41 ’s @entity87			1
despite the crowds , @entity5 seemed uncharacteristically good - natured as they rode buses taken them from the darkness of downtown			0
the @entity30 has no exact timeline for restoring service .			0

massive queues formed around @entity86 ’s @entity85 and @entity41 ’s @entity87
