by @entity0 , @entity1 editor consumer groups and an mp are demanding a police inquiry into @entity5 after evidence emerged it sent bullying letters from fake law firms to threaten customers who were behind on repayments			1
@entity12 ’s biggest payday lender was yesterday named and shamed by a @entity14 watchdog , which ordered it to pay more than £ 2.6million in compensation to 45,000 customers who received the bogus letters			1
but consumer groups say there is clear evidence of a criminal deception and insist the police should be brought in			2
@entity5 has been slammed for pressurising indebted to customers by sending letters from fake law firms @entity5 could be investigated for a string of criminal offences , from fraud to falsely impersonating a solicitor and even blackmail , says lawyer @entity29			1
it is a crime under the @entity31 to dishonestly make a false representation , intending to make a gain or cause a loss to another , when you know it is false and misleading			0
the @entity38 of 1974 makes it an offence for someone to falsely claim to be a solicitor – although there is usually a six month time limit from the date of this particular offence			0
@entity5 could also be charged with blackmail under section 21 of the @entity50 – as a threat to take people to court could be regarded as ‘ an unwarranted demand with menaces ’			1
mr @entity29 said : ‘ so , whilst “ blackmail ” conjures up connotations of masked men making a ransom demand after a kidnapping , this may well be close			0
’ @entity63 consumer affairs minister @entity62 called for a police investigation of @entity5 saying : ‘ aside from potential fraud , harassment of a debtor is a criminal offence			1
’ the mp pointed out that it is also an offence to pretend to be a lawyer under the 1974 @entity38			0
she added : ‘ news that @entity5 was sending fake solicitor letters to cash - strapped customers who could n’t afford their fees to frighten them – and charging them for these – is further proof of the need for @entity12 to rid itself of these legal loan sharks			1
’ while the company presents itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with its friendly tv ad puppets , an investigation by the @entity80 found extensive evidence of ‘ thuggish ’ behaviour			1
among @entity5 ’s victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage			1
the @entity80 said @entity5 sent letters to customers in arrears from what appeared to be two law firms , called ‘ @entity98 ’ and ‘ @entity99 and @entity100 ’ – but these two companies were invented by @entity5 to put pressure on customers			1
in some cases extra charges were added to the outstanding debt to cover the cost of sending these threatening letters			0
despite the damning evidence , the watchdog added that £ 2.6million is the biggest compensation order it can impose on @entity5 – because the wrongdoing occurred before tougher laws were implemented last year			1
@entity115 founder @entity114 said : ‘ it seems to me that this was a criminal deception			0
@entity5 was inventing lawyers and making demands for charges			2
i am amazed that there is no substantial fine or criminal investigation			0
‘ i do n’t think the @entity80 needs to look very far to find evidence of laws that have been broken , the real problem is that they do not seem to have the will or the courage			2
’ @entity127 , director of supervision at the @entity80 , said : ‘ @entity5 ’s misconduct was very serious because it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation for customers in arrears			1
‘ the @entity80 expects firms to pay particular attention to fair treatment of those who have difficulty in meeting their loan repayments			1
’ the £ 2.6million of redress covers a flat compensation payout of £ 50 for each of the 45,000 customers who were targeted between 2008 and 2010			1
some will also get refunds of charges that were unfairly applied			0
payday loan adverts are mostly aired on day - time tv , raising fears that the unemployed are being targeted payday firms boomed during the recession , as desperate families turned to high - interest loans to get by however , this represents a tiny figure in the context of the company ’s profits , which are estimated at more than £ 100million a year on the back of making more than four million loans a year to more than one million customers			1
one of the company ’s two founders , @entity164 , who was chief executive at the time the threatening letters were being sent , stepped down from his post as chairman just two weeks ago in what appears to have been a damage limitation exercise			0
@entity170 , founder of @entity171 joined in the attack : ‘ this just shows that while @entity5 hires expensive marketing , pr and public affairs consultants to try to position itself as the good guys in a bad industry , it ’s all a sham			2
‘ using lawyers as fake as its puppets , then having the stomach to charge people for it is a thuggish tactic , aimed at scaring and intimidating people already struggling			2
’ the firm ’s interim chief executive , @entity188 , said : ‘ we would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone affected by the historical debt collection activity and for any distress caused as a result			2
' the practice was unacceptable and we voluntarily ceased it nearly four years ago			0
’ an order to pay £ 2.6million in compensation is little more than pocket money to @entity5 and its multi-millionaire founders			1
@entity164 and @entity201 set up what is now @entity12 ’s biggest payday loan company in 2007 and within two years had raised £ 14million from @entity14 investors			1
today , the two enjoy luxury homes and lifestyles with mr @entity164 ’s personal fortune estimated at more than £ 34million , while mr @entity201 is said to be over £ 25million			2
their wealth has been built on the back of families who have struggled for cash during a six - year cost - of - living squeeze , during which time the firm has also attracted many critics			2
split : @entity164 and his ex-wife @entity217 , pictured left , and software designer @entity201 , right mr @entity164 , 44 , originally from @entity218 , started his first company in @entity220 and became an investment banker on arrival in the @entity12			2
he was already a wealthy man when his family set up home in a six - bedroom house in @entity226 , @entity227 , in 2002			0
the house was bought for some £ 580,000 and is worth at least four times that figure today			0
as the business grew , mr @entity164 reportedly paid himself more than £ 1million a year while cosying up to @entity14 investors who have ploughed a total of £ 100million into the loans colossus			0
while @entity5 has been happy to send threatening letters to customers , the businessman has claimed the loans it provides are force for good			1
he said in 2012 : ‘ credit in consumer society is absolutely critical			0
without it , you have no social mobility ... wealthy people will stay wealthy			0
’ despite his financial successes , mr @entity164 has suffered failure in his personal life and it emerged last year that he was splitting from his wife @entity217 , the mother of their three children , after 15 years of marriage			0
like his partner , @entity201 , 44 , also originates from @entity218			0
his background was in technology and he is credited with developing the software that assesses customers on the @entity5 site , but now he has stepped back from managing @entity5 and likes to see himself as an artist and web entrepreneur			1
he married @entity259 , a 41 - year - old violinist , in 2001 and five years later bought a £ 950,000 home on the border of @entity262 and @entity263 in order to pursue a leisurely life as a sculptor			0
writing about @entity5 , he boasted of having been the ‘ thinker , the designer , the visionary ’ in the ‘ glorious moment ’ when the company began trading			2
his art , he says , is a way to ‘ allow my ego to feel fantastic ’ .			0
