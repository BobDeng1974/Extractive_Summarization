a business analyst who quit a high - flying job in @entity2 to become landlord of a country inn has seen his freehouse named pub of the year			1
@entity7 quit the rat race in 2013 and spent nearly all his savings on leasing @entity10 in @entity11 near @entity12 , @entity13 , after realising his ' passion ' was ' spending time in a wonderful old boozer talking rubbish with friends			1
' the 31 - year - old had had heard a talk from @entity21 on being passionate about work which got him thinking ' about how i would look back on my life as an old man '			1
after quitting his high flying job in @entity2 @entity7 opened a pub in @entity13 with his wife @entity29 which has just been named @entity30 so mr @entity7 quit his job at the telecoms consultancy in @entity33 and moved with his now - wife @entity29 to the heart of rural @entity13 - despite never having pulled a pint in his life			1
but mr @entity7 's passion has clearly paid off , with the freehouse now awarded the prize of @entity41 - just two years after the couple took it over			1
he told the @entity43 : ' i started thinking about how i would look back on my life as an old man			0
' you have to be passionate , but if you are really , really passionate about something , the chances are you will be good at it			0
i am doing 90 - hour weeks , but it does n't feel like work			2
' at the time of switching careers , the only experience mr @entity7 had had with the beer world was brewing his own in the bath at his home in @entity60 , south @entity2			1
despite this , mr @entity7 ploughed all his savings into buying the pub and , within a year , the pub had won its local @entity66 branch competition			1
it then took the regional title before beating thousands of pubs across the country			0
the pub was given the accolade by the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , which described it as a ' gem '			1
mr @entity7 opened the pub in 2013 and just two years later it is known as one of the country 's best the pub specialises in cider and beer both of which mr @entity7 is especially passionate about the interior of @entity82 or the @entity83 as it is known to locals has a cosy feel mr @entity86 grew up in @entity13 but left to work as a telecoms business consultant in @entity2			1
he regularly visited pubs in the capital and quickly realised what made some more welcoming and successful than others			2
a speech by @entity93 boss @entity21 about being passionate about work made him realise that he wanted to work in the drinks industry , and he devised an original plan to run a micro brewery			0
but when his father told him the @entity10 was for sale so he took the plunge - and now he 's working on plans to brew his own beer			1
mr @entity7 says that he learnt good bar practice visiting his own locals in the city			2
he said : ' when i went to pubs in @entity2 i figured out that little things like a warm welcome , saying hello , goodbye or , better still , knowing your name , meant a lot so i have put that into practice here			0
' i had a good job in @entity2 , but i felt i needed to do something i really cared about			0
' mr @entity7 says that he learnt good bar practice visiting his own locals in the city built in 1840 , the salutation , know locally as the @entity83 , has two cosy bars , a log fire and skittle alley , while @entity66 's judges were overwhelmed by the welcome drinkers receive , one saying : ' it 's like being invited into a private house			1
' mr @entity7 was determined to continue local traditions such as @entity127 dancing and apple wassailing on offer , while regulars can try their luck playing barman in special @entity134 nights			1
regulars often crowd round the wooden piano in the bar for singalong sessions , enjoy @entity127 dancing and go wassailing to ensure a good cider year			1
there are live folk music events , guest chef nights - one each month , the only time dinner is served - and meet the brewer evenings so locals can see the face behind their pint			1
' we have a lot going on and it is always busy here , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' i ’m not sure what makes it so special , it has something about it that you ca n’t put a name to			0
' on a friday night all the regulars are crammed in and you can barely move but it is just the most brilliant place			0
' the salutation has two cosy bars , a log fire and skittle alley meanwhile , mr @entity7 raised 11 pigs in a walled garden last year and now serves their meat on the menu			1
the pigs are fed apples from local growers , as well as pulp leftover from cider making , which gives the meat an ' incredible ' flavour , mr @entity7 said			2
he explained : ' this is n't a pub for vegetarians but we 're in rural @entity13 , this is traditional farming country			1
' mr @entity7 added that he had to give thanks to not only his staff but his customers for making the pub what it is today			1
' we count ourselves unbelievably lucky to have a brilliant team of staff who are so passionate and dedicated , as well as a community of locals who have given so much to support and contribute towards the pub. ' they have been brilliant from the moment we arrived			0
they ’ve painted the skittles hall , done the gardening , built picnic benches			0
' i was terrified on my first night , i thought everyone was thinking , ‘ who is this young guy behind the bar , what does he know about running a pub ? ’			0
' i truly believe that every village should have a pub , they are so vital for the local community and i would be absolutely devastated to mess this one up			0
we had to get it right			0
it ’s been hard , really hard , but it is worth it			0
' mr @entity7 offers few soft drinks and no coffee or tea as he says this is a pub where people come to drink real ale mr @entity7 says that having been awarded such a prestigious title was a dream come true for him			2
' for the @entity83 to have won @entity224 is beyond our wildest dreams - we 're totally shell - shocked			2
' pubs are so important to me that to have our own one recognised in this way is just amazing			0
' it is these people that have made the pub what it is today and for that we are incredibly grateful			0
' @entity66 director @entity236 said that they had been incredibly impressed with what the husband and wife had managed to achieve since opening			2
' what @entity7 and @entity29 have done in the short time they have been running the pub is nothing short of staggering and goes to show that passion , enthusiasm , and a real love of beer are hugely important when running a pub. ' they have hit the ground running and taken what was already a great pub and made it truly exceptional - beating off over 50,000 other landlords from across the @entity258			1
' pubs are judged on atmosphere , level of service , value for money and community focus , with extra weighting for the quality of their real ale , cider and perry			0
the winning pub is described in @entity66 's @entity271 2015 as a ' rural gem in the @entity273 , within walking distance of the @entity275 , @entity276 ` and @entity277			2
' the enthusiastic landlord keeps an inspired selection of ales and eight real ciders and perries			0
