lottery winner @entity0 has already been bombarded with requests for cash following his huge £ 148million win - despite being away on holiday with his family			1
the tiny shop which he jointly runs with his best friend in the @entity10 town of @entity11 has seen dozens of letters pour through its doors since he went public with his huge win on tuesday			1
his best friend and business partner @entity15 - who is keeping the @entity17 running - said the requests for money had been piling up			1
after winning the @entity42 jackpot , mr @entity0 and his wife @entity22 caught an @entity44 flight for a short break with their two young children			1
and rather than make for the sun and five - star luxury , they appear to have headed north to spend time at the windswept @entity54 caravan park where mrs @entity56 ’s parents live			1
the manager of the @entity59 site in @entity60 , @entity61 , said yesterday : ' yes , they are here but they do n’t want to be disturbed			2
they are not giving interviews but they are here on the park			2
' in business : mr @entity0 with his best friend @entity15 , left , inside the shop the couple went on the modest break with their children , @entity76 , six , and @entity77 , four , after the press conference on tuesday where their identities were revealed			1
mr @entity15 , 39 , said he had since spoken to mr @entity0 while he is on his break and said they are trying to let everything sink in			1
they just want to have some time with each other and the children and various other members of family			1
' they are just trying to let this all sink in and carry on as normal , the children come first for them			1
' already the couple have showed signs that there new found vast wealth wo n't go to their head			1
in it to win it ! @entity15 told the couple to spend their money how they please the @entity105 flew with @entity44 to an undisclosed location in @entity107 for their first holiday abroad as a family they queued with other passengers at @entity111 before flying off to their hideaway where they will ' acclimatise ' to their newfound wealth			1
the only nod to luxury was the @entity118 helicopter that whisked them from the hotel near @entity121 , @entity122 , to the airport four miles away – and that was paid for by lottery organiser @entity125			0
mr @entity15 thinks the couple will continue to keep their feet on the ground			1
' i know @entity125 do lots to help people who come into large sums of money and i think they are listening to the right sort of advice			0
' obviously it is going to be life - changing for them but as people they will still have the same values and that is that their children will come first			1
' they will probably move but i believe they will stay in the area			0
' still on a budget : @entity0 and @entity56 board a helicopter after it was revealed that they had won £ 148million on the lottery jet - setters : the helicopter took the couple on a four - mile journey to @entity111 , where they boarded an @entity44 flight with their two children the gated caravan park where the @entity105 are staying has a bar , cafe and newsagents , as well as a gym and hairdresser			1
an adjoining field has pitches for tents			0
entertainment includes pub quizzes and bingo on friday and saturday nights			0
reviewers on one camping website gave @entity59 six out of ten			0
highlights are the reasonably - priced cafe , an entertainer whose ‘ singing ... was good ’ and ‘ immaculate ’ beaches nearby			2
but some complained about showers that were prone to flooding , toilets that were ' not as clean as they could ’ve been ' and a lack of activities for children			2
meanwhile back home in @entity11 , @entity10 , it was business as usual at @entity17 , the secondhand records and musical instruments shop mr @entity0 runs and now hopes to expand			1
a steady stream of customers arrived to offer their congratulations after co-owner @entity15 opened up yesterday			0
the determined show of normality was confirmed by mr @entity0 ’s aunt , @entity195 , who said the couple wanted to shield their children from upheaval after scooping @entity201 ’s second largest euromillions win			1
payout : the @entity202 won £ 148million in august , one of the biggest lottery jackpots in history ' if they ’re going to move house they will tell the children what ’s happening but they wo n’t explain why			1
they will protect them from it , ’ the 65 - year - old told the @entity212 yesterday			2
' they wo n’t contaminate them by taking them out shopping and all that rubbish			0
' they wo n’t be spoilt children , i do n’t think that for one minute			2
and if they are then auntie will knock them into shape			0
’ mr @entity15 , 38 , said the @entity105 spent their last holiday in a caravan in @entity226			0
' obviously , the amount of money they have won is life - changing in a huge way but their core values as people will not change too much , ’ he said			2
' they always put their children first and do not have extravagant tastes			2
i genuinely believe they will be the same people that they have always been			0
' @entity240 mrs @entity56 , 40 , plans to quit her job as a healthcare assistant at @entity243 in @entity244 but mr @entity0 , 41 , is expected to carry on working			1
' whether he will want to be here every day behind the counter is another matter but i am sure he will do at some point , ' mr @entity15 said			0
' they are working people			0
having an interest in something is important			0
they will not just sit around and do nothing			0
' the @entity202 discovered they had been catapulted into 516th place in the @entity255 on saturday night			0
but their wish list is decidedly modest			0
as well as a new home with a high - tech kitchen , mrs @entity56 is considering buying an @entity259 and her husband wants to visit the @entity261			1
they also plan to share their good fortune with a small group of family and friends			0
and there could be more happiness for the family after the @entity212 revealed that mr @entity0 and twin brother @entity270 have a half - brother from their father @entity273 ’s first marriage			1
the brothers were aware of @entity277 ’s existence but had never been in touch			0
and mr @entity277 , a 55 - year - old college manager , has had no contact with his father since the 1960s and had no idea he had remarried and started another family			2
miss @entity195 yesterday suggested her nephews would ' probably , in time , have a get - together ' with their long - lost relative			2
' they ’re the type of people who might do that , ' she said			0
mr @entity277 , who has insisted he has no interest in his relative ’s fortune , said : ' thanks to the lottery i have discovered a whole new branch of my family			0
