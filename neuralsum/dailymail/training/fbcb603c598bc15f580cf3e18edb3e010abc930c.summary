‘ i have been fair because i ’ve respected my contract			1
i spent six years on the same contract and never went to the boss ’ office to ask for more , but that ’s life			1

‘ if i was the first one then okay , but i do n’t know what to think			0
every time a player leaves they seem to get abuse			2
there are so many on social networks but that does n’t represent the whole @entity7 family			1
‘ of course , i had a great moment with @entity7			1
that will stay with me for the rest of my life , but my team is @entity6 now , it is not @entity7			1
