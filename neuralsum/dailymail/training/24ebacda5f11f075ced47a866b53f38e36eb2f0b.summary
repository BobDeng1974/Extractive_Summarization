sending out a signal : this 19.8 - foot fragment of the once 360 - foot transmission that stood atop the tower shows how dramatically everything was broken apart charred : thousands of artifacts , like this payphone , were stored for more than a decade before being moved to the museum interactive : an animation at left shows the path that the terrorists took on that fateful morning , while pieces of steel from the impact floors on the 96th to 99th floor ( right ) are shown directly above the visitors ' heads preview : the exhibit is meant to give a sense of the lead up to the attack and the aftermath as well as a minute - by - minute account of what happened portraits and profiles describe the nearly 3,000 people killed by the september 11 attacks and the 1993 trade center bombing			1
nearly 2,000 oral histories give voice to the memories of survivors , first responders , victims ' relatives and others			1
