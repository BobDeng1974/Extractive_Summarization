@entity1 boss @entity0 believes his side 's slow start to the @entity5 season is partly down to the club having to sign ' a lot of new players ' as they look to compete on four fronts this season			1
the @entity11 have lost two of their first four @entity5 games so far this season , but @entity0 believes it 's just a matter of time before his players click into gear			1
he said : ' we 've had to bring in a lot of new players this summer because of the @entity19			0
naturally that takes a bit more time but i 've been really pleased with the way everyone has settled in			0
we 've got players adapting to different counties			0
@entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 jog out for @entity1 training on thursday ahead of the @entity5 clash against @entity32 the new @entity1 striker seems to be making lots of friends at his new club , even getting up close and personal with a training dummy @entity29 ( right ) looks on in confusion as @entity28 shows off his sense of humour by poking his head through a training dummy @entity1 boss @entity0 ( centre ) orchestrates a game of football tennis during training which @entity47 ( left ) and @entity48 take part in ' we will just continue to work hard			1
the players have got great qualities but it will take a bit of time for that to show through			2
there 's no magic formula it 's just time			1
' ' our form last year was incredible but we were not playing like that this time last year			0
the players need to settle			0
' @entity0 also admitted that his side ' were n't at the level ' he expects as they crumbled to a 1 - 0 defeat against @entity67 last weekend			1
@entity1 were beaten by a first half strike from @entity69 last saturday as @entity0 ' side failed to convert a number of chances at @entity73			1
@entity0 laughs as @entity1 striker @entity47 looks to return with a volley form his @entity11 team - mate @entity48 ( right ) @entity47 , @entity76 and @entity48 in action as the @entity78 attempts an acrobatic volley during a training session at @entity81 skrtel ducks as his team - mate for the small - sided match @entity85 ( right ) looks to return a shot towards @entity47 's direction @entity48 takes a rest on an inflatable training dummy as he awaits to next drill during @entity0 ' training session he added : ' last week against @entity67 we were n't at the level we expect in the final third			1
' they defended well and got the result , but we move on			0
in reflection , beating @entity97 was a very good result , even if maybe people thought we 'd win more comfortably			0
@entity102 's good form has shown how well we did to beat them , and we were outstanding against @entity104			0
' the international break came at a bad time for us and we lost some of our players , which upset our rhythm , but we 'll continue to work hard			2
' @entity0 has also given his backing to misfiring midfielder @entity112 after the @entity114 's disappointing start to the season			1
the 22 - year - old has started three of the @entity11 ' four league matches but last weekend 's defeat to @entity67 was the first time he completed 90 minutes , while he was also taken off in their @entity19 win over @entity122 minnows @entity97			1
@entity123 ( left ) warms - up while @entity1 new boy @entity28 gets to grips with a training dummy @entity125 ( right ) and @entity48 seemed to be on the winning side against @entity127 in @entity1 's best performance so far - the 3 - 0 win at @entity129 was left on the bench throughout and the early part of the campaign has seen him fail to showcase the talent he has displayed intermittently since his arrival in january 2013			1
however , @entity0 has no doubt about the @entity114 's quality or ability			2
' he 's a brilliant young player , a fantastic young player , ' he said			0
' i had planned to leave him out of the game against @entity67 because he 'd had a lot of travelling in the international week , and if we did n't have so many injuries he would have been given a rest on the side and then played in the @entity19 game			1
@entity47 , @entity127 , @entity48 , @entity85 , @entity125 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity76 warm - up @entity0 looks on as @entity76 controls the ball during @entity1 's thursday afternoon training session ' we could n't afford to do that			1
we had to play him , but it was great for him and his experience getting back into the @entity114 squad			0
' i 've got no qualms about him ; he 's a big , big talent			0
he has lit up the @entity5 since he came to the club			2
' he 's going to have some games where he wo n't be at his best , but he always gives his best and that 's all i ever ask of the players			2
' the kid is a great boy who wants to do well			0
he 's very conscious that i have absolutely no doubts about him			0
' @entity28 scored his first @entity1 goal on tuesday night as his new team defeated @entity19 debutants @entity97 @entity1 new boy @entity167 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity11 defender @entity48 as the pair head out to training together @entity171 bails out lacklustre @entity1			2

@entity0 believes the number of new players at @entity1 is one of the reasons for the club 's slow @entity5 start
@entity0 *insists* there is no ' magic formula ' to winning and his new players will take time to adapt
@entity1 boss admits his side ' were n't at the level ' he expects during defeat against @entity67
