by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 02:19 est , 17 june 2013 @entity1 launched a fresh assault on benefits for better - off pensioners yesterday			1
calling for a debate on ‘ welfare for the wealthy ’ , the deputy prime minister indicated he would like to see affluent pensioners lose benefits such as the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes before the election			1
he condemned a climbdown by the @entity14 over its bid to stop sending the winter fuel allowance , which is worth up to £ 300 a year , to @entity17 pensioners living in warm countries such as @entity19 and @entity20			0
welfare warning : @entity1 said today that further welfare cuts will have to be made but the @entity23 would not allow the poorest to be targeted first @entity24 had planned a new ‘ temperature test ’ but the move has been blocked by @entity26 , partly because of concerns that some pensioners would lose out in a mild winter			2
the move means an extra 120,000 expat pensioners living in @entity33 are now likely to get the payments , which were restricted to those who had moved abroad after retiring in @entity17			0
@entity1 said : ‘ we need to have a debate about welfare for the wealthy			2
that is being blocked at the moment because the @entity40 do n’t want to have that debate , and that ’s why we ca n’t move forward with the wider reforms to our welfare system			0
’ the @entity23 leader also hinted he had not abandoned hopes of getting a deal in the tense negotiations surrounding the @entity48 for 2015 - 6			1
' i think the fact we are asking people on low incomes to pay through their taxes to basically pay the fuel bills of people who do n't need to heat their homes because they are living in sunny parts of @entity33 and maybe did n't even work here , i think that lifts the lid on a wider problem in our welfare system , ' mr @entity1 told the @entity63 @entity62 programme			1
' yes , we need welfare reform			0
we have already made , with my full support , significant savings to welfare			0
warning : mr @entity1 , appearing on the @entity63 's @entity68 , said that handouts to the elderly should therefore not automatically be exempt from cuts ' but if you 're going to make further welfare savings , which i am prepared to look at , then you 've got to start at the top , you 've got to start with welfare for the wealthy , benefits paid to the rich and the retired			1
' the @entity78 announced earlier this month it would strip the wealthiest pensioners of the winter fuel allowance if it wins the 2015 general election			0
and speaking last weekend , shadow chancellor @entity82 said he planned to include pension spending inside @entity78 's proposal for a welfare cap - adding later that the party was committed to the coalition 's ' triple lock ' pension increase reforms			2
@entity90 has pledged benefits for older pensioners will not be cut before the election , and @entity40 sources last night confirmed that included the period of the new spending review			1
‘ this is non-negotiable , ’ a source said			0
‘ the prime minister made a pledge and we will stick to it			0
’ @entity78 opposed @entity105 measures to bring down the welfare bill , including a £ 26,000 cap on households and below inflation benefit increases			2
last week , in an attempt to regain credibility on the economy , @entity78 leader @entity110 said the party was prepared to back the government ’s idea of a cap on so - called ‘ structural ’ welfare spending for three years from 2015 - 16 .			1

@entity1 *questioned* whether all over *75s* people should get free *tv* *licences*
@entity123 will *unveil* 2015 - 16 spending review on june 26
@entity105 have pledged to *protect* welfare *payouts* to the elderly in this @entity128
but mr @entity123 could *vow* to cut universal handouts after the next election
