@entity0 confirmed as new @entity2 boss on rolling contract @entity4 says former boss @entity5 did not tell him to turn down the job aim is to secure @entity9 safety and finish above @entity11 @entity0 says situation with owner @entity13 is ' not what it seems ' @entity2 chairman @entity15 helped convince former @entity17 striker to join by @entity19 - @entity18 published : 07:49 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 21:47 est , 2 january 2014 is @entity2 the right move for @entity0 ? @entity0 insisted he will have the final say on all footballing matters at @entity2 after he was confirmed as their new manager			1
such assurances from chairman @entity15 and owner @entity13 were one of the central strands of the negotiations that have led the former @entity17 striker from @entity32 to south @entity33			1
his arrival came six days after @entity35 was sacked in acrimonious circumstances , though elements of uncertainty still surround the nature of the 40 - year - old ’s deal , with @entity15 saying his ‘ rolling contract ’ was ‘ infinite ’			1
despite repeated questioning , no definitive timescale was given for the contract			2
‘ i agree , ’ @entity0 said			1
there were reports that @entity5 , who remains close to @entity35 , had actually advised @entity0 last week to steer clear of working with @entity13			1
@entity0 dismissed those as ‘ absolute nonsense ’ , before defending the @entity89 millionaire after three months of chaos at the club , in which numerous allegations of interference have surfaced			2
big influence : @entity0 is hoping to put everything he learned from @entity5 into practice by leading @entity2 to @entity9 safety this season thumbs up : @entity2 owner @entity13 has managed to bag his first choice , @entity0 , as boss time 's up : @entity35 was sacked last friday after a chaotic last three months in charge at @entity2 only one @entity4 has managed in the @entity9 and that did not have a happy ending			1
@entity106 took charge of @entity108 in 1999 but lasted for less than a season as the @entity110 were relegated from the @entity111 ( table below is all competitions ) two more @entity4 have managed in @entity114 , although both were in the championship			2
@entity117 was in charge of @entity119 for just 57 days , registering one win , three draws and six defeats in his time there and famously storming out of the club 's @entity124 after he was made to go on stage and wear a stocking on his head , and a @entity130 wig , and dance on stage			2
@entity133 was a disaster at @entity135 in the first half of last season , beginning a campaign which was to end in relegation to @entity140			2
‘ he ’s the owner , he wants his club to be successful , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ he has ploughed loads of money into the club and he wants it to be successful			0
for me , i had a great meeting with him			0
‘ he just confirmed to me that this is a man who wants his club to succeed , he ’s willing to help this club progress and develop into the @entity9 club			1
not everything is as it seems from the outside			0
’ @entity15 has been a crucial figure in landing @entity0 , who won two league titles and a cup in his three years at @entity73 , before @entity13 flew him from @entity32 to @entity156 on wednesday for final discussions			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i had great chats with @entity15 , and i met the owner , and they ’ve convinced me they want me to be in charge of the football , to take the club forward			1
’ he added : ‘ i am very confident that football matters , that is my matter			0
’ quite how this relationship plays out remains to be seen , with @entity15 insisting a new boardroom structure and ‘ culture ’ of dialogue will preclude the sort of breakdown in relations that contributed to @entity35 ’s exit			2
for his part , @entity0 knows that @entity9 survival is the least of @entity13 ’s expectations			1
here 's looking at you : @entity0 and @entity13 share a glance in the directors ' box at the @entity183 during @entity2 's match against @entity72 entrance : @entity0 ( right ) and @entity13 arrive at the @entity183 ahead of @entity2 's game against @entity72 new wave : @entity13 sheepishly acknowledges the camera as he and @entity0 walk into the @entity183 the @entity65 celebration was originally performed by the singer and fans of @entity194 punk group @entity192 before being adopted by @entity2 fans during the 1990s			1
the group 's singer watched footage of the funeral of @entity200 and witnessed people doing the movement to express their grief and sadness			0
@entity206 supporters used it during a match against @entity209 in september 1990 and its popularity quickly grew			0
former chairman @entity211 is well - known for performing the @entity65 in front of travelling @entity214 fans during an @entity216 tie in 2002 , while current owner @entity13 has also celebrated with the unique gesture			1
beyond that , @entity0 has targeted a 15th - place finish in the table and the scalp of @entity11			1
he said : ‘ i know what i ’m going into and i ’m so looking forward to it			0
i ’m going to bring my energy , enthusiasm , football knowledge			0
i want my team to play exciting , attacking football			0
we want the fans to come here and be proud of us			0
‘ i will only ask for 100 per cent effort for the players , as i asked from myself and as was hammered down , of course , by the gaffer ( @entity5 ) and @entity238			2
but that ’s the norm			0
’ he added : ‘ if this season you end up top 15 you are top five of the second league in the @entity9			2
and ( i would like to finish ) above @entity11			1
’ with another @entity5 protege entering @entity9 management , it will be intriguing to see how closely such a mild - mannered man mimics his former mentor			1
taking his seat : @entity0 ( second left ) in the directors ' box at the @entity183 as @entity2 owner @entity13 ( bottom right ) makes his way up taking charge : @entity255 took charge of @entity2 for their draw with @entity259 and defeat to @entity72 asked if @entity13 was considering changing the colour of @entity2 's home shirts back to blue during thursday 's press conference , chairman @entity15 said he had ' nothing ' to say			1
he said : ‘ i have obviously been moulded by him			0
i have not studied him but i have worked under him and had the best teacher in man management or managing a football club			0
‘ we might be different personalities but for me i have learnt a few tricks from him and took advice from him			0
you think back at times , “ what did the gaffer do when this and that happened ? ” so of course i am looking through my diaries			0
‘ i was a boring but a reflective man			0
i always used to write notes when i was a coach			0
i stayed in his team talks , meetings so i have learnt from him			0
’ @entity285 's back and smiling at @entity286 @entity35 , the man @entity0 seems set to replace at @entity2 , was pictured at @entity287 ahead of @entity286 's @entity111 match against @entity289			1
@entity35 , who played for @entity286 , was greeted by @entity291 @entity290 and it seemed to take his mind off the acrimony surrounding his sacking by @entity13			2
smiles better : @entity35 ( left ) is greeted by @entity297 @entity290 at @entity287			0
