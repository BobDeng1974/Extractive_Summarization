the woman on the right ? also @entity4			2
once a size 22 , the singer is now a svelte size ten – and almost unrecognisable			1
but while many dieters would be deeply envious of her weight loss , @entity12 herself thinks she has gone too far			1
@entity4 has dropped from a size 22 ( left ) to a tiny size 10 ( right ) over the last four years , but says she is now actively trying to re gain weight as she feels she has lost too much the 51 - year - old said : ‘ personally i think women look better with a bit of chub on them			1
i ’ve lost too much weight and i ’m working on getting fatter again			1
’ usually reluctant to discuss her size for fear of betraying the ‘ sisterhood ’ , in a new interview she opened up about her concentrated attempt to lose weight four years ago			1
‘ it was a mixture of health reasons and not wanting to be looked after by the patronising thin , ’ she said			1
she added : ‘ it ’s funny as my whole character has been based upon not getting approval elsewhere			2
and i do n’t like the kind of approval that goes with weight loss			1
‘ still , in my 50s where my next significant event is being a grandmother , i have to worry about my scraggy a * * *			0
’ miss @entity4 first found fame in the 1980s as one half of the electropop duo @entity42			1
she went on to launch a successful solo career , selling more than 25million records			0
when @entity4 performed when i was your girl , the first single from her 8th solo album on this morning on the 8th may 2013 ( right ) , she was half the woman she was when she was an eighties pop icon ( left ) @entity4 showed off her slender body at the @entity52 in july last year , after deciding to lose weight four years ago @entity4 , pictured here performing at @entity54 , has always been known for her alternative style and image but success came with its own set of problems			1
the singer has previously spoken about how she grew up feeling ugly and isolated , often suffering cruel slights for her appearance			1
she once said : ‘ by the time i was a teenager i was so absolutely convinced of my @entity66 distortedness that i went all out to be as physically unattractive as i could as an act of defiance			0
’ these issues were exacerbated by fame			0
for almost a decade , miss @entity4 was a virtual prisoner in her own home , crippled by depression and agoraphobia			1
at the same time her weight ballooned			2
miss @entity4 , now a mother of three , said her children saved her			0
she explained : ‘ becoming famous is a really shocking thing , especially when you do n’t have aspirations to it			0
when she was in @entity42 , @entity4 's larger frame was as much an integral part of her public image as her shaggy hair and deep soulful voice @entity4 's new album ' the @entity85 ' is her eighth in a amazing career that has seen her sell over 25 million records ‘ it got to the point where i would try and avoid making eye contact with anyone			1
it was freaky and it just happened overnight			0
‘ in a lot of respects having kids has saved me from myself			0
if you ’ve got a child and the child wants to get up , then you have to get up			0
‘ there is also something to be said of being tired of just having a particular pathology			0
i just got tired of being depressed			0
’ last month miss @entity4 , who is married to teaching assistant @entity106 , sang at the wedding of her best friend , @entity108			0
in the interview , with the @entity110 , she described how she sympathised with the ‘ loving and generous ’ comedian because of the attention she attracted with her own battles with weight			2
