president @entity1 , 3rd left , holds talks with @entity3 prime minister @entity164 , 1st right , at the @entity167 guesthouse in @entity6 @entity1 used a joint news conference with the prime minister , left , to assure @entity3 that @entity11 was committed to its defense including the tiny islands at the heart of a row with @entity156 mr @entity1 also urged @entity3 to take ' bold steps ' to clinch a two - way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement mr @entity1 also urged @entity3 to take ' bold steps ' to clinch a two - way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement that is a central part of the @entity11 leader 's ' pivot ' of military , diplomatic and economic resources towards @entity9 and the @entity181			1
' we do n't take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to @entity161 , but historically they have been administered by @entity3 and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally and what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by @entity3 , ' @entity1 said			0

the president cancelled a visit to @entity9 last year because of the @entity11 government shutdown			2
the cancellation provided fresh fodder for those in the region who worry that the @entity226 's much - hyped pivot to @entity9 is continually taking a backseat to other foreign and domestic priorities			0

' while @entity156 is not on @entity1 's eight - day itinerary , leaders in @entity243 will be closely watching the president 's tour			2
@entity1 's advisers insist the trip - and the @entity226 's broader @entity9 policy - is not designed counter to @entity156 's growing power , and they say the president is not asking @entity9 nations to choose between allegiance to @entity255 or @entity243			0
on the economic front , @entity1 is unlikely to have much new to show for efforts to deepen trade ties with @entity9			0
negotiations on the @entity260 , a 12 nation free trade pact , are stalled , particularly discussions between the @entity11 and @entity3 over tariffs on agriculture .			0
