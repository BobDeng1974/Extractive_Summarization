every year around 1,000 people in the @entity1 die waiting for a heart transplant and scientists are searching for a lifesaving alternative			2
advances in transplant technology could one day enable surgeons to use animal organs in people , which could solve the problem of donor organ shortages around the world			0
now scientists have managed to transplant pig hearts into baboons , whose immune systems were supressed to stop them rejecting their new hearts			1
take heart : advances in transplant technology could one day enable surgeons to use animal hearts in people , which could solve the problem of donor organ shortages around the world			2
a heart transplant using a human heart is pictured there were 145 heart transplants in the @entity1 last year but a shortage of donor hearts			2
a transplant might be considered for someone who has severe heart failure , but it could be years before a suitable organ becomes available			0
currently , a heart transplant operation takes between four and six hours			0
the patient is connected to a heart - lung bypass machine that makes the blood circulate around their body			0
the surgeon will them transplant the new heart before making it beat			0
when the heart beings to take over pumping and the patient 's condition is stable , the bypass machine will be turned off			0
the surgeon will then close the cut - open breastbone with wire			0
the procedure is risky and the heart could fail to pump , or the body could reject the new organ			0
approximately one in 10 people dies due to complications in the year following surgery nine out of 10 people say they support organ donation , but only three in 10 sign the register			0
just like the transplant of human hearts , there is a risk that the new heart will fail after surgery , but experts reported that the pig hearts survived in their recipients for more than 500 days			1
far more people are waiting for organ transplants than there are donor organs so if animal organs can be used , thousands of lives could be saved across the globe			0
dr @entity79 , chief of transplantation at the @entity82 's @entity81 , in @entity83 , @entity84 , told @entity85 that transplanting organs from animals could be used as a stopgap until human organs become available , or as a complete replacement			2
he told the @entity91 in @entity92 that tissue rejection by the recipient ’s immune system is the biggest hurdle to a heart transplant			1
in their experiment , they used genetically engineered pig hearts – which are similar to a human 's - without the genes known to cause tissue rejection in humans , and replaced them with human genes to encourage the body to accept the heart			1
to study the hearts , they implanted them into the abdomens of baboons - without removing their original hearts - but connecting the pig 's hearts to the baboons ’ circulatory system			1
scientists have managed to transplant pig hearts into baboons ( stock image left ) , whose immune systems were supressed to stop them rejecting their new hearts			1
pig ( stock image right ) hearts were genetically engineered to minimise the chances of rejecting in the recipients ' bodies the experiment proved that the scientists can control the rejection of organs using immunosuppressive drugs			1
the scientists will now use the genetically engineered organs to replace baboon ’s hearts and if successful , it could still be years before animal transplants can be used in clinical trials on humans			1
dr @entity79 believes that other tissues could also be transplanted from animals to humans , so that people could carry on with their lives with a pig ’s liver , kidneys or lungs in the future .			1

scientists in @entity84 transplanted pig hearts into baboons , whose immune systems were supressed to stop them rejecting their new hearts
pig hearts were genetically engineered without the genes causing tissue rejection in humans and were replaced with human genes instead
the hearts survived in their recipients for more than 500 days
it could be years before clinical trials can be conducted on humans
one expert thinks that animal liver , kidneys , lungs and hearts could be implanted into humans in the future
