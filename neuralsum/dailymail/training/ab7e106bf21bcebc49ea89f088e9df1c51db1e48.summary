by @entity0 published : 23:44 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 02:59 est , 7 october 2013 they are the foods that the average @entity3 shopper had n't even heard of just a decade ago			1
but @entity3 ca n't live without chorizo , sweet chilli sauce and prosecco , according to a survey of changing culinary habits			1
@entity9 carried out by food magazine @entity11 found that although the spicy @entity14 sausage was unheard of ten years ago , chorizo is a staple part of the diet of 42 per cent of those surveyed			0
staples of our diet : most of us had never heard of chorizo or prosecco just a decade ago , but now most of us ca n't live without them a further 35 per cent said they ca n't live without a bottle of sweet chilli sauce alongside the ketchup and mayo with almost a quarter rating a bottle of prosecco as a ' must have ' in the wine rack			1
the survey also found a change at the top in terms of who the nation rates as its favourite celebrity chef			1
a fifth now favour @entity41 , with the @entity42 and @entity43 also proving popular with foodies			2
but our favourite television chefs from a decade ago have declined in popularity			0
@entity48 , who topped a similar poll compiled by the magazine in 2003 , gained just seven per cent of the vote this time around			2
faring little better were @entity52 , with just nine per cent of the vote and @entity54 , who polled just 11 per cent			0
change in favourites : @entity41 , left , is now our favourite celebrity chef according to the poll , whereas 2003 winner @entity48 , right , has seen her stock reduce the survey also found that more than half of us are cooking from scratch more often than we were 10 years ago but , perhaps due to the recession hitting us in the wallets , only a third of us are dining out more			1
when we do eat out , 40 per cent of us say that chain restaurants are what make us most unhappy about the modern food scene , followed by bad service and the ' prohibitively expensive ' cost of eating out			0
cupcakes were rated the favourite food trend of the decade with locally produced seasonal food , farmers ' markets and ' diverse cuisine ' increasing in popularity , no doubt because of the influx of cookery shows on television			0
popular : the @entity42 are also well liked among foodies according to the survey @entity83 : 14 per cent of those surveyed turn to top chef @entity43 for culinary inspiration @entity11 editor @entity86 said : ' in the last decade , we have witnessed a period of profound change in the @entity3 food scene			2
' we are far more diverse in our tastes and seek out great value whether cooking at home or eating out at home and abroad			0
' @entity41 's relaxed cooking style and the seasonal , often home - grown , ingredients he uses chimes with the increased trend of using ingredients when they are at their best			1

@entity3 also now ca n't live without sweet chilli sauce and prosecco
@entity41 is the nation 's favourite celebrity chef *replacing* @entity48
more than half of us are cooking from scratch more than we did in 2003
