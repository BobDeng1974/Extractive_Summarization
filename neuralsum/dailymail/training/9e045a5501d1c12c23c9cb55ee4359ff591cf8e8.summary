by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 15 august 2013 [ headerlink ] defence : the campaign refutes claims that aspartame is unhealthy @entity5 has launched an advertisement campaign to defend the use of sweeteners in their diet soda			1
the advertisement is the next phase of a campaign to push back at critics who blame @entity5 ’s products for the @entity16 ’s ever - rising obesity rates			1
the @entity18 ad , which features two smiling women drinking the soda , comes shortly after @entity5 reported a drop in sales			1
in this year ’s second quarter , @entity23 reported a four per cent loss in the amount of soda sold in @entity28 , with @entity18 taking the worst hit			1
in 2012 sales volume for @entity5 fell one per cent , while @entity18 fell 3 per cent			1
rivalling cola brand @entity31 fell 3.4 per cent , while @entity31 fell 6.2 per cent			2
the decline in sales of fizzy drinks has been a long - running trend in the @entity16 following reports of negative effects on health and several studies on possible hazards of consuming artificial sweeteners			2
@entity5 ’s campaign kicks off in the @entity44 area with print ads in @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48			2
the advertisement highlights how diet soda can help people manage their weight and stresses the scientific evidence showing the safety of aspartame			1
it features a picture of two women under the heading ‘ quality products you can always feel good about , ’ with several paragraphs of text underneath			0
‘ @entity65 , these low - and no - calorie sweeteners have shown to be safe , high - quality alternatives to sugar , ’ it states			0
‘ @entity5 is trying to get out front and proactively defend these diet sweeteners , ’ said @entity68 , editor of @entity69 , which tracks the industry			1
the declines come even though the @entity74 says aspartame may be safely used in foods as a sweetener , and the ingredient can be found in a wide array of other type of drinks and foods			2
sweet smiles : the advertisement put out in @entity44 by @entity23 in defence of the use of @entity87 in their @entity18 diet decline : fewer people , turn to mainstream soda companies to quench their thirst with @entity23 reporting a one per cent drop in sales of @entity5 and three per cent for the diet version in 2012 the @entity96 also notes that most studies using people have found that aspartame is not linked to an increased risk of cancer , including the largest study on the topic			1
another explanation to the decline in sales of products with artificial sweeteners is the recent trend of organic and natural ingredients			2
@entity111 , used in @entity18 under the brand name @entity113 , is an artificial product 200 times sweeter than sugar			0
the safety of the product has been a hot topic since its @entity16 approval in 1981 , but there is no evidence of any detrimental effects on health if consumed in normal doses			0
it has been found safe for human consumption in more than 90 countries , with an @entity128 wide approval in 1994			0
the majority of @entity111 consumption comes in the form of diet soft drinks with a standard can of soda containing 180mg of aspartame			1
this means that a 165lbs adult would need to drink approximately 21 12oz cans of diet soda to exceed the recommended daily rate			2
‘ even if ( aspartame is ) 100 per cent safe to use , it 's still problematic from a nutrition standpoint , ’ said @entity142 , a registered dietician based in @entity143 who is critical of the food industry 's marketing practices			1
@entity142 noted that foods and drinks are n't good for people just because they do n't have any calories or have been shown to be safe			0
he added that ingredients such as aspartame only keep people hooked on sweets over more wholesome choices			0
this summer , @entity5 rolled out a version of its namesake soda sweetened with natural sweetener stevia in @entity162 , a smaller market where it can better gauge how the drink performs			0
@entity165 , vice president of social commitment at @entity5 , said the goal is to clear up the confusion around diet sweeteners			0
she said the company will gauge the response in @entity44 and @entity172 before expanding the push			0
‘ this is a beginning and it 's a learning process , but we do have plans to do more , ’ she said .			0
