the suspected ringleader and seven members of a gang behind a £ 1.3million cyber raid on a leading bank were arrested yesterday			1
@entity6 detectives say the 47 - year - old mr @entity7 led the operation that siphoned off cash from the accounts of @entity12 customers			1
one of the gang posed as an it engineer at the bank ’s branch in @entity16 , north @entity17 , to install a device that hacked into its computer systems			1
following a lengthy surveillance operation , the trail led to a flat in nearby @entity38 , which was crammed with hi - tech equipment			2
eight men , including @entity41 and @entity42 , were in custody last night			2
thousands of credit cards and financial records were seized at addresses across the capital			2
@entity49 raid : how the @entity50 reported it on september 14 the gang is thought to be linked to the criminals behind last week ’s raid on a @entity17 branch of @entity49 using an identical spying @entity58 superintendent @entity57 , who is a specialist in electronic crime , said : ‘ this was a highly - organised criminal network with each individual filling a specific role			1
‘ all criminal networks have a head and we very much believe we have now apprehended our mr @entity7 as part of this operation			2
we believe this has put a major dent in this network ’s ability to commit cyber-crime in this country			2
we believe this was a top - tier criminal network			2
’ similarities : last week a gang allegedly attempted to plug a discreet gizmo into a @entity49 computer to spy on its contents			1
he said his officers were working with banks to stop further thefts			2
@entity12 has been able to recover a ‘ significant amount ’ of the money stolen in the @entity16 operation by tracing the accounts into which the cash was moved			1
a ' big mixture of nerdiness and having some nerves ' would be needed to try to pull off this type of fraud , according to internet security expert @entity95			0
since part of the crime involves walking into a branch and attaching the gadget to a computer , this would need ' a bit of bottle on the part of the criminal but you would have to be technical on the other end to be able to get the information '			1
valuable data such as access to keyboard strokes and what is happening on - screen could be obtained , according to mr @entity95			0
a kvm would be about 8ins by 6ins by 3ins in size and would probably look like ' another anonymous box with loads of wires ' , he noted			0
he said : ' they ( would - be criminals ) would need physical access to your computer and the best way to do that is to be part of the cleaning staff or part of the it team and to just work in the office and plug the thing in			1
' with human nature being what it is , people do not often confront people they see as new in these roles in their office			0
' organisations need to have proper physical security in place and foster an attitude so staff can challenge people and say ' where is your pass ? '			0
' it is not just money that could be stolen , but also data			0
' but customers are angry they were not told about the breach , which took place in april			0
speaking outside the branch , @entity154 , 52 , said : ‘ i thought this would be something we would ’ve been informed about			1
i am shocked to hear about it			0
’ @entity160 , of @entity12 , insisted the protection and security of its customers was its highest priority			0
‘ we identified the fraud and acted swiftly to recover funds on the same day , ’ he @entity166 , a technology expert , says cyber criminals are combining ‘ nerdiness with nerves ’ to carry out the thefts			1
‘ it takes a certain degree of bravery to walk into a bank and do this posing as an it technician , ’ he said			0
‘ while these people no longer carry the physical threat of the bank robbers of the 70s armed with a gun and a stocking over their head , they are putting themselves at risk			0
it raises questions about whether @entity12 had enough security in place to spot the unusual movement of money , as well as the physical security of its branches			0
’ the hackers planted spying hardware known as a ‘ kvm switch ’ , standing for keyboard , video and mouse			0
purchased online for less than £ 100 , this allows a single user to control several computers from a remote location			1
four men , from @entity209 , west @entity17 , have appeared in court charged with conspiracy to steal in the @entity49 raid			1

fake computer engineer sent into @entity16 branch to install ' *bug* '
the device transmits what *'s* on a computer *desktop* to a remote *viewer*
' one is a significant arrest . he is the @entity228 of @entity230 cyber crime , ' @entity26 says
another gang tried same audacious heist on @entity49 branch last week
