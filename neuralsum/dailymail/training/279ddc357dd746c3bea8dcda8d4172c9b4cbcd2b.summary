by @entity1 reporter published : 10:57 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 12:29 est , 4 december 2012 four of @entity4 ’s most cash - strapped countries are set to pull out of the @entity7 song contest - in case they win and have to host the lavish event the next year			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 have all said they are ‘ very unlikely ’ to take part in the cheesy singing contest that has become a @entity4 institution			1
the @entity10 also said they could barely afford this year ’s £ 100,000 fee to enter an act , and that ‘ sequins and stage effects ’ were distasteful at a time of austerity			1
no contest : the four countries said they are ' very unlikely ' to enter the competition next year @entity10 protesting in october about the interference in their finances from @entity29			1
pulling out of the @entity7 would be another sign of the country 's economic woes an official at @entity10 ’s state - owned television network said : ' it ’s not just that we do n’t have the money to pay to enter , at this point it would be morally wrong			1
' and winning it would incur a huge expense for our country next year			0
' the cost of staging @entity7 is put at around £ 60million			1
@entity11 state broadcaster @entity43 said entering the contest would be ‘ provocative ’ when it was imposing drastic belt - tightening measures on its population			0
@entity10 was represented by @entity49 this year but said they could barely afford the £ 100,000 fee to enter @entity12 and @entity13 also cited ‘ financial reasons ’ over the cost of entering and possibly having to host the event , due to take place in @entity57 capital @entity58 in may next year			1
@entity13 , which also pulled out last year , issued a statement saying : ' after a very careful analysis we made the difficult decision not to take part			2
the countries between them have garnered just one victory - @entity10 in 2005 , when @entity69 's ' my @entity67 ' came out on top			1
@entity10 first entered the competition in 1974 , while @entity11 joined the fray 7 years later			1
of the four @entity12 is the longest - running having entered every years since 1964			0
@entity13 is the relative newcomer , having seen its first entrant in 1994			0
the rush of nations pulling out comes after @entity78 ’s entrant for the 2012 contest was urged to sing badly and not to win , to avoid any risk of having stage the competition in 2013			1
bosses of @entity78 public television told pop star @entity85 ‘ to throw ’ her entry amid massive government spending to reduce the huge national debt			0
the 33 - year - old singer said directors of state - run broadcaster @entity92 called her in to say : ' please do n’t win			2
we do n’t want to pay for it in 2013			2
' she added : ' i can understand why they asked			0
the money would be better spent paying ordinary people ’s wages			0
' the @entity7 - an annual competition organised by member countries of the @entity103 - has take place 57 times since it 's debut in 1956 , with @entity107 winning the inaugural tournament			2
there have actually been 60 winners after a four - way tie in 1969 , with 26 different countries having won the @entity114 @entity113 has claimed victory four times			2
the most victories for a single country is seven by @entity119 , with two of those - in 1980 and 1987 - performed by @entity122 , making him the only person to have won more than once as performer			0
@entity12 is the country with the longest history in the contest without a win - it made its forty - sixth appearance at the 2012 contest			0
no joy : @entity12 is the country with the longest history in the contest without a win with entrants such as @entity136 singing ' @entity135 ' in 2004 failing to make the grade the voting techniques have evolved throughout the years but central to them has been the calling on of the points by a representative from each country			0
while @entity7 provides a unique opportunity for winning artists to capitalise on their success , relatively few have actually gone on to stardom			0
the most notable exception to this was @entity152 who won the 1974 contest for @entity57 with their song @entity156 and went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time			1
another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame was @entity163 , who won the 1988 contest for @entity107 with the song @entity165			0
@entity10 's 2005 @entity7 - winning song ...			2

said they are ' very unlikely ' to take part in the 2013 competition in @entity57
@entity10 said it could barely afford the £ 100,000 fee
