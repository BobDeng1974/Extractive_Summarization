@entity7 on thursday stressed that @entity1 saw the @entity3 family of e-readers and tablets as a service , with hardware a critical element of its digital content business			1
@entity1 is competing with @entity14 , @entity40 and other technology companies for a foothold in the booming mobile - device market , because these devices are fast becoming the preferred tool to access consumer media over the @entity47			0
as the world 's largest internet retailer , it is essential for @entity1 to have a major presence in this new sector			0
@entity1 is willing to make little or no money selling cheap tablets and e-readers because it wants to get the devices into as many hands as possible , then sell higher - margin digital content , such as e-books , video , games , apps and music , to a more connected and engaged customer base			1
however , it is believed the gadgets will show users adverts every time they are used			2

' the firm first revealed the @entity3 paperwhite , which has a new lighted screen			1
@entity7 told the crowd the display they wanted did n’t exist , so they spent four years developing it			0
' people are going to love the light so much they ’ll leave it on all the time , ' he said			2

the tablet is powered by an @entity99 processor from @entity100 , which @entity1 says outperforms the @entity101 3			0
the @entity26 also includes stereo speakers , an upgrade over the @entity16 's mono speaker			2
it also has an ' x-ray ' feature which lets people find out an actor 's name simply by tapping on them on screen , and multiple user accounts so children can easily use it without ruining their parent 's setting			2
the fire will be an effort to take a larger share of a tablet computer market dominated by @entity14 's @entity27			1
it could help @entity1 boost sales of digital goods such as e-books and movies			0
the event came a day after @entity126 and @entity40 's @entity128 division announced five new smartphones between them			2
the two from @entity126 will be the company 's first to run the next version of @entity133			0
consumer electronics makers are trying to generate interest in their products now , before @entity14 announces a new @entity137 and possibly a mini ipad next week			0
