by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity2 blaring from pitch - side speakers in training and a committee created for players to moan			1
the world of @entity8 is still weird and wonderful			1
the sense of wonder spread to his press conference on saturday when , unprompted , he took the admirable step , albeit a risky one , of criticising his own fans for their deplorable @entity18 chants during the 2 - 0 win over @entity20			1
‘ until we make a stand the world ai n’t right , ’ he said			0
‘ how often do we turn a blind eye to things ? ’ it was spoken with passion and anger , a hand slapping the table and eyes darting around the room			0
in charge : @entity8 shouts instructions to his @entity36 players during their 2 - 0 win against @entity20 with any luck , those supporters will react the right way , because their club is enriched by this emotional man of a thousand tangents , just as he is by the club			1
what better surroundings than @entity36 for a manager who sometimes likes to feel he is fighting the world ? it ’s that attitude that appears to have made men of little boys , a group that @entity8 says ‘ were all good at making excuses ’ when he arrived in january and they were 21st in the championship			1
they finished last season with an eight - game unbeaten run and have started the new one with passing football and a hammering for a club in need of its own inspiration			2
his methods , revealed by @entity36 defender @entity68 at the weekend , are wacky yet chime completely with what you might expect			1
‘ every manager has a different way of doing things and this time it ’s started off pretty well , ’ said @entity68 , who had scored @entity36 ’s opening goal and recently became a father			1
‘ the oddest thing he ’s done was when he first came in			0
we had a training session with speakers around the pitch and ended up doing training drills to @entity2 at full blast			1
it was @entity84 , was n’t it gaffer ? ’ in the groove : @entity8 looks to have got the @entity36 players fired up for the new @entity54 season by this point , @entity8 had entered the room and was seated at the back			1
@entity8 : ‘ are you telling these people ? that ’s private ! ’ beevers : ‘ it ’s not — not anymore			1
’ @entity8 : ‘ it did n’t work though because nobody enjoyed it			2
does n’t he look more mature now he ’s a father ? ’ beevers : ‘ i ’ve always looked mature			0
another day in the @entity8 house			1
the manager would later lose his cool in discussing the behaviour of his fans , an answer which came in response to a gentle opening question about his side ’s perfect start to their season			2
unique : @entity68 ( left ) revealed @entity8 played @entity2 songs during his first training session there was also a rant about a penalty not given and the actions of @entity121 , who he believes have not shown @entity36 fans respect when travelling to @entity20 in the past			1
there were contradictions and all manner of digressions			0
at one stage , he explained himself by saying : ‘ i am doing a lot of talking because i have had a long summer			0
’ @entity8 works himself up and then calms himself down			2
he is emotional but utterly decent , and also a fine manager who has evolved over 18 seasons and is not afraid to try new things			0
his solution to last season ’s in - house moaning has been to create a complaints committee , enabling senior professionals to raise issues from the squad			1
democracy : the @entity36 boss has also created a complaints committee to help senior player raise any issue ‘ i ’m not involved ’ , said @entity68 , 24			1
‘ it ’s more the older generation , your @entity151 ( @entity152 ) and @entity153 ( @entity154 ) who have more experience in the game			0
‘ anything you need , you go to them and they go to the manager			0
he ’s got it more organised			0
he has a certain way of doing things and he ’s installed that into us from day one on and off the pitch			0
we got our rewards for it here			0
’ some bookies make @entity36 second favourites to go down			2
@entity8 loudly mocked those suggestions in his dressing room after this match			2
a win over @entity20 is no great indicator these days , so it remains to be seen how they face the challenge			1
one thing that is certain is @entity8 will not stop talking — to do that he says ‘ you ’d have to lock me in a cage , in a bag ’			2
who would ? performance of the weekend @entity183 told me last week that ‘ if money was everything in football i would n’t bother ’			0
how interesting , then , to see @entity183 ’s @entity188 beat @entity189 2 - 1 at @entity190			1
@entity188 choose not to pay transfer fees and @entity189 recently spent £ 11m on @entity192 , who came off after 57 minutes			0
winners : @entity194 is mobbed by team mates as he celebrates scoring for @entity188 @entity197 ’s @entity196 ... @entity20 owner @entity198 was everywhere on saturday			2
smoking in the car park before kick - off , then in the dugout talking to manager @entity202 before chatting with @entity36 ’s groundsman			1
he was silent in the dressing room afterwards			0
@entity205 and @entity206 have picked up where they left off			0
they netted a combined 44 goals two seasons ago before @entity205 ’s season at @entity213			0
reunited , they each scored in the 3 - 0 win over @entity216			1
@entity217 was described by @entity219 ’s chairman as the country ’s best young boss and he has been backed financially			0
over £ 2million was spent on @entity222 — and he scored twice on his debut at @entity224			0
everywhere : @entity20 owner @entity198 made his presence felt on saturday afternoon			2

@entity8 *'s* @entity36 side enjoy opening day 2 - 0 win against @entity20
@entity36 boss played @entity2 songs during first training session in charge
