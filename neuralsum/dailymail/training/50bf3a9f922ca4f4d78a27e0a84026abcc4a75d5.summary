by @entity0 so there will be no @entity3 derby in @entity4 after all following the second penalty shootout defeat to befall @entity6 and his @entity8 champions in the space of four days			0
they did not seem particularly upset about that as the squad flew out of @entity13 in the early hours of sunday morning and headed for @entity3 instead of @entity14 where neighbours @entity15 will now face @entity16 on monday night			1
with the remainder of his @entity19 contingent due to report back at the start of the week and @entity21 arriving on wednesday , @entity6 was just grateful there were no injuries on a pitch he had described as ‘ high risk ’ beforehand			0
it passed off without any problem after the surface was heavily sanded and watered overnight and then touched up with painted green			0
@entity28 twice went ahead through @entity52 ’s fifth goal in three games on tour and an @entity56 penalty only to pegged back on both occasions – just as they had been by @entity16 at @entity58 on wednesday – as @entity59 claimed both goals for the @entity35			1
@entity62 ’s unconventional save with his foot from @entity64 sent the shootout to sudden - death after @entity67 and @entity68 both saw their attempts saved , but @entity70 blasted wildly over with what may prove to be his last kick for @entity28 and @entity73 wrapped up victory			1
at least @entity6 now has two more days at home to prepare for next weekend ’s @entity76 against @entity77			0
‘ i said the pitch was a high risk but they worked hard on it to improve it and fortunately nothing happened , ’ he said			0
hope : @entity62 did make a fine save with his leg during the penalty shootout teamwork : @entity52 is congratulated by @entity87 after he put @entity28 in front on saturday ‘ the tour has been extremely useful and the team have been professional			1
we ’ve had some great performances but the condition of the pitches condition has hindered us			0
‘ the positive of these few games has been the quality of the games and the levels my players reached			0
the negative will be the travelling distances			0
‘ we are not ready for the new season yet because the rest of our squad are only coming back on monday			0
’ @entity52 fired @entity28 ahead in the 35th minute after @entity107 flicked the ball to him near the left touchline			1
the @entity110 produced a burst of pace to get away from three @entity35 defenders , and when two more closed him down inside the box he steered a clever shot between them and inside the neat post with goalkeeper @entity33 wrong - footed			1
@entity30 were level two minutes later , however , when a neat move opened up the @entity28 defence			1
captain @entity120 squared the ball to danger man @entity122 who drilled it past @entity62 despite the keeper getting a hand to it			0
both teams had a goal ruled out for offside , @entity59 in the second minute after another incisive move and @entity87 shortly before half - time			2
in form : @entity52 scored five goals in three games in the @entity136 poacher : but @entity59 was impressive two , notching a double for his side blow : @entity30 replied almost immediately in @entity13 in the @entity136 @entity30 : @entity33 , @entity141 , @entity142 ( @entity143 63 ) , @entity144 ( @entity64 13 ) , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity120 , @entity147 ( @entity148 63 ) , @entity149 ( @entity150 63 ) , @entity151 ( @entity152 46 ) , @entity59			1
goals : @entity154 ( 36 , 66 )			2
@entity28 : @entity62 , @entity155 ( @entity67 46 ) , @entity56 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 ( @entity159 46 ) , @entity160 ( @entity161 46 ) , @entity162 ( @entity163 46 ) , @entity107 ( @entity164 46 ) , @entity52 ( @entity68 75 ) , @entity87 ( @entity165 46 )			1
goals : @entity52 ( 34 ) , @entity56 ( 53 , pen )			2
booking : @entity56 ( 45 ) , @entity67 ( 50 )			0
there was also one penalty appeal apiece with @entity30 coach @entity171 striding onto the pitch gesticulating angrily when @entity156 ’s challenge sent @entity59 tumbling as he raced in on goal			2
it was a 50 - 50 call by referee @entity176 but @entity171 , for one , certainly felt as though he had got it wrong			0
city were equally aggrieved on the stroke of half - time , @entity56 talking his way into the official ’s notebook as he protested against the decision not to award a penalty against substitute @entity64 when his untidy challenge upended @entity52			1
@entity28 had the best of the other first - half opportunities			1
@entity107 dragged his low shot wide when @entity162 picked him out unmarked in the box , @entity52 sidefooted over from an even better position following good work by @entity160 and @entity87 who then squared a wonderful pass that invited a close - range finished from @entity107 but the @entity195 seemed a little reluctant to go into the challenge with the keeper			1
tough tackle : @entity28 forward @entity52 worked tirelessly throughout the match tight marking : two @entity30 players double up on @entity28 winger @entity160 wrestle : @entity107 is tugged back by @entity201 during the game it was @entity107 ’s last contribution to the game because he was one of six changes made by @entity6 at half - time			1
the @entity28 boss would probably have done it anyway but the intense heat – the players twice stopped for a water break – and state of the pitch no doubt played a part in his thinking as well			2
it was one of the substitutes who earned @entity28 the penalty from which @entity56 restored their lead in the 53rd minute			2
@entity161 combined with @entity52 and then cut inside @entity142 who clearly brought the @entity222 down			2
there was no hesitation from mr @entity176 on this occasion and @entity56 steered his spot - kick into the roof of the net			0
@entity59 struck again in the 66th minute , however , when @entity30 levelled against the run of play			2
neither @entity156 nor @entity157 were alive to the danger when @entity143 slipped a pass in behind them , and @entity59 took the ball around @entity62 before scoring from a tight angle			0
neither side were able to produce a winner , meaning that @entity28 were already relying on @entity16 losing against @entity238 before they went into the shootout			1
it went against them again but @entity6 is unlikely to have lost much sleep over it on the flight back .			0

@entity28 draw 2 - 2 with @entity30 in @entity13
@entity52 and @entity245 on target
@entity154 nets double for @entity35 side
@entity16 will top @entity136 regardless of @entity238 result
