by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 08:27 est , 4 october 2012 an eminent nutrition expert is urging people to spurn half - litre cans of @entity4 and other energy drinks because they contain dangerous levels of caffeine and sugar			1
a 473ml can of @entity4 , costing £ 1.99 , contains an astonishing 13 teaspoons of sugar and 150 mg of caffeine , roughly the same as four cups of instant coffee			1
biological scientist and nutrition expert dr @entity13 says there is no need for such a high concentration of the substances as the potential health consequences include rapid or irregular heartbeat , elevated blood pressure , sleeping trouble , weight gain , muscle twitching , diarrhoea , nausea , vomiting - and even sudden death			1
how much ? : @entity4 's 473ml can ( right ) contains 52g of sugar , roughly the same as 13 teaspoons earlier this year he released the findings of a @entity33 study into what soft drinks do to our bodies			1
the research shocked him so much he now does n't touch soft drinks , branding them ' evil ' , especially when combined with booze			0
he said : ' while there is good evidence that caffeine has positive effects on cognitive performance of people - we all know this from experience - there are also physiological effects			2
buzz : caffeine is an effective stimulant , but high volumes may be dangerous , according to dr @entity13 dr @entity13 says there is no need for such high volumes of caffeine and sugar			1
he added : ' every person has their own sensitivity for caffeine and certain younger people or people with undetected cardiovascular problems are at higher risk experiencing negative effects from caffeine			0
' in fact caffeine blocks signals which are essential for a good regulation of blood pressure , heart rhythm and blood flow to muscle , kidney function and other tissues			0
' the combination of high sugar and caffeine and alcohol obviously deceives the brain into the feeling of a high energy level while the rest of the body needs to cope with the negative effects of high caffeine and alcohol - sometimes leading to serious outcomes like sudden death			2
' these drinks are disastrous for health			0
you can not compensate for the amount of energy you 're taking on			0
' dr @entity13 says there is no need for a large can size of soft drinks containing caffeine and high sugar levels and people should stay away from them			1
he added : ' you might think you save some money on a larger can size , but you take the risk that you ingest large amounts of caffeine in a short time with unexpected outcomes			0
' consumers have no insight into how much caffeine and sugar there is in the drink			0
' comparisons with tea or coffee are misleading because people do n't drink tea and coffees quickly as they are hot , usually come in smaller quantities and do n't have 51g of sugar , dr @entity13 said			1
the best defence , he added , would be to increase taxes and limit advertising where children might see it , similar to alcohol and tobacco			0
' the sugary taste also makes the drink appeal to children and youths who are not attracted by teas and coffees because of their bitter taste , ' he added			1
' the chance that a sensitive youth drinks the same 150mg caffeine from teas or coffees is extremely low , but there is a good chance that a youth drinks a second can of @entity4			2
' dominance : @entity4 is the biggest energy drink in the world			0
last year it sold 4.6bn cans of @entity4 with a turnover of £ 3.4bn @entity4 cans state that the beverage has a high caffeine content and is not recommended for children , pregnant women and ' persons sensitive to caffeine '			1
the company disputes the claim that the 473ml can has the same caffeine as four cups of coffee			2
a spokesperson added : ' a 473 ml can of @entity4 contains roughly the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee			1
' we provide these larger can sizes because many consumers have indicated to us that they would like this choice			0
' dr @entity13 also believes that liquid sugars not only alter our bodies , but also foster addict - like responses			1
countries such as @entity182 and @entity183 are introducing soft - drink taxes to cut consumption			0
@entity4 was founded in 1984 by @entity187 @entity186 , who became aware of popular ' tonic drinks ' while in the @entity190			0
now @entity4 is the world 's biggest energy drink , selling around 30bn cans in 164 countries since 1987 .			2

half - litre cans of @entity4 contain 52g of sugar and the same caffeine as four cups of coffee
biologist says the cans are *unnecessary* and ingesting such a high volume can have health *repercussions*
