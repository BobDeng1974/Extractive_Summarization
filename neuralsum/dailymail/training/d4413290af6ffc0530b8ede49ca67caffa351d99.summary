if @entity1 was ever inclined to dwell on his rapid ascent in recent months and relax a little , there is a vivid memory which he retains to keep him grounded			1
@entity6 , 20 , was a raw @entity9 right - back last season , battling with @entity10 to stake his claim in the team			1
in the past six months , he has made his @entity15 debut at centre - half , won the @entity17 , made his @entity19 debut and played in the @entity20			1
it is little surprise he describes his season so far as a ‘ whirlwind ’ but he is unlikely to get carried away			2
@entity1 has won the @entity17 and played in the @entity20 since joining @entity15 @entity25 trains with his team - mates ahead of their @entity28 fifth round clash with @entity29 @entity25 says he used to clean the boots of @entity32 ( centre ) while they were at @entity9 on sunday he is expected to return to the team to take on @entity29 in the @entity28 fifth round as @entity15 defend the trophy			1
yet only a few years ago he would have been out in the cold cleaning boots as dusk fell at @entity9 ’s @entity41 training ground			1
in those days , @entity9 were an aspiring @entity42 club rather than a much - admired @entity20 - chasing outfit and @entity25 was fully aware he was near the bottom of the pile			1
‘ for two years i had to clean @entity32 ’s boots , ’ he said			1
‘ it was a good experience			2
i know some clubs do n’t do it but it keeps everyone grounded and as an academy player you know your place			2
it makes you want to be the player who ’s getting his boots cleaned			2
’ in @entity32 , it turns out he had a mentor			1
‘ he was fantastic to me			2
he was polite and would speak to me			0
i wanted to be the person he was			0
’ @entity25 ’ loyalty to @entity32 has n’t dimmed			1
a light - hearted inquiry as to whether @entity32 tipped well elicits a mock horrified response			1
‘ i ca n’t discuss that , ’ says @entity25			1
‘ that ’s confidential between boot boy and player ! ’ @entity15 boss @entity66 has been impressed with @entity25 since he signed him last summer @entity25 also made his senior debut for @entity19 last year after moving to @entity15 @entity25 also played in the @entity20 , pictured here after their 3 - 3 draw with @entity70 despite the menial labour , @entity25 does n’t have a hard - luck story to tell			1
@entity9 are recognised as one of the leading producers of football talent in the world , with @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 the best - known graduates of their academy			1
and he went to @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 , an independent school , passing nine gcses , although the school ’s strength in sport was initially something of a problem			0
‘ my school specialised in rugby and hockey , ’ he said			0
‘ they did n’t do football , so i played rugby for a bit , hockey for a bit and i enjoyed them			0
i ’d play football on a saturday			0
it almost got to the point where the school wanted me to stop playing football on a saturday to concentrate on school sports			0
we had to argue the case			0
we had to say that i had to concentrate on football			0
’ given the evidence of the last six months , the right choice was made			2
@entity25 is still absorbing his success			1
he will concede that he was ‘ a bit nervous on the first day ’ at @entity15 after his £ 12million move			1
he was thrust straight into the team in an unfamiliar position at centre - half and performed well in his first game — the 3 - 0 win over @entity122 in the @entity17			0
per @entity124 ’s need to recover from the @entity125 and the injuries to @entity127 and @entity128 mean he has made 32 appearances in a season in which he was anticipating having to wait for his chance			2
four years ago @entity9 introduced six @entity133 players to the home crowd before a fixture against @entity136			1
@entity25 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139			1
front ; @entity141 , @entity142			0
@entity25 came through the academy at @entity9 and played for their first team before joining @entity15 @entity25 ' good form for @entity15 has earned him @entity20 games and an @entity19 debut @entity25 trains with @entity15 alongside fellow @entity19 internationals @entity150 ( left ) and @entity151 @entity1 graduated from the famed academy that is the life blood of @entity9 , producing dozens of kids who have blossomed into top - class internationals — as well as netting the club millions of pounds			1
the only time they got their sums wrong was when , with the club in financial plight , they waived their 25 per cent sell - on fee when they sold @entity77 to @entity165 in may 2007			0
it meant @entity9 missed out on an £ 21.5m windfall when @entity77 moved to @entity168 for a world - record £ 86m in 2013			1
that was a rare oversight , however , as illustrated by this list of recent graduates whose transfer fees alone have earned @entity9 more than £ 100m			2
@entity174 to @entity175 for £ 7million - jul , 2003 @entity78 to @entity15 for £ 9.1million - jan , 2006 @entity77 to @entity165 for £ 7million - may , 2007 @entity176 to @entity177 for £ 3million - jul , 2007 @entity178 to @entity179 for £ 400,000 - jul , 2009 @entity180 to @entity181 for £ 1.2million - jul , 2009 @entity79 to @entity15 for £ 12million - aug , 2011 @entity137 to @entity182 for £ 27million - jul , 2014 @entity80 to @entity183 for £ 24million - jul , 2014 @entity1 to @entity15 for £ 12million - jul , 2014 total - 102.7m ‘ i set a few goals at the start of the season and i exceeded them massively so i ’m really pleased , ’ he said			1
‘ it was a whirlwind few months , it all happened so quickly i did n’t really have the time to sit back and think : “ wow , this is pretty good ”			0
' i just got on with it and tried to play as best i could in every game			0
it was an amazing few months getting my @entity15 debut , @entity20 debut , @entity19 debut			1
‘ i knew coming to a club like @entity15 there would be competition for places			2
i knew that at training every day it was going to be tough and that ’s what i wanted			0
you ca n’t turn down the opportunity to come to a club like @entity15			2
i wanted to rise to that opportunity and prove to everyone what i can do and how good i can be			0
’ @entity66 is clearly impressed			0
as well as a potential centre - half , he has him down as a possible holding midfielder			0
and @entity25 is part of a new generation of players — including @entity137 , @entity10 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 — causing a stirring of optimism in @entity19 , especially with the @entity224 at @entity225 in the @entity226			1
‘ i would be happy to be there if i got called up , ’ says @entity25 , even though he has now made his senior team debut			1
‘ it would be amazing to go to that and to win it			0
i think there are a lot of good young @entity235 players coming through			0
there is good hope for the future			0
of course , it would put down a big marker ( to win it )			0
but even if we did n’t , there ’s still a lot of talent coming through			0
’ @entity25 used to compete alongside @entity10 for the right back spot at @entity9 @entity137 is another former @entity9 academy star who has moved on to @entity182 his friendship with @entity10 is intriguing			1
the pair were vying to be @entity9 ’s right - back last year ; now it is the @entity19 post for which they contend			1
‘ he ’s a really good guy and we have a really healthy relationship			0
' we were always pushing each other in training and games			0
if i was n’t playing , he ’d be playing and he ’d be at the top of his game , and vice versa			0
when it was your turn to play , you always felt like you had to grab every opportunity and play the best you could			0
’ for now , though , it is @entity29 in the fifth round and the defence of the @entity28 on which to focus which should , in itself , generate a degree of satisfaction			1
it certainly beats scrubbing boots on long winter evenings at @entity41			2
watch @entity15 take on @entity270 in the @entity271 exclusively live from 3.30pm today on @entity272			2
share your experiences of this year ’s @entity28 on @entity272 by following # @entity275 .			2
