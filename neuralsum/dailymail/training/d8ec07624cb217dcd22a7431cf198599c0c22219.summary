by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 02:27 est , 18 may 2012 @entity1 came under fire last night for using the @entity3 as an excuse to impose a £ 1 ‘ tax ’ on parcels			2
it will raise prices and cut delivery targets during the six - week @entity11 period because of the expected traffic chaos			1
it means anyone using @entity1 ’s @entity16 arm to post a parcel to much of @entity18 will have to pay an extra pound.deliveries could be delayed by an extra day because of the disruption caused by the @entity3			1
postal deliveries will be disrupted by the @entity11 this summer in addition , customers have been warned that any letter or parcel posted from the start of the @entity3 on july 27 until the final day of the @entity11 on september 9 could take at least one extra day to arrive			1
@entity1 will also scrap the pledge for @entity29 items to arrive by 9am or before 1pm next day , downgrading the guarantee to ‘ the next day ’			2
yesterday ’s announcement – immediately described as a ‘ tax on business ’ – affects items sent to any of @entity18 ’s eight main postcodes			2
these are @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , covering around two million homes and businesses			0
anybody outside @entity18 who needs to send post to one of these areas is being told to send it a day earlier than usual			1
within @entity18 , it should go ‘ earlier in the day than usual ’			1
the @entity1 ’s normal pledge is that a first - class letter will arrive the next working day , and a second - class one within three working days			0
@entity16 ’s £ 1 charge will replace the 50p surcharge which is already levied on parcels sent to postcodes in central @entity18 affected by the capital ’s congestion charge			1
the announcement comes weeks after @entity1 hit its customers with inflation - busting increases in stamp prices			0
a first - class stamp , which used to be 46p , now costs 60p			0
a 36p second - class stamp has jumped to 50p			0
major delays are expected on @entity18 's transport routes - commuters are advised not to travel by tube yesterday ’s statement from @entity1 points out that its rivals , such as @entity73 , are also levying extra charges during the @entity3 period , with many charging far more than @entity1 ’s extra fee			1
but @entity77 , from the @entity78 , said : ‘ whilst i can understand that there may be disruption as a result of the @entity3 , charging considerably more for a poorer service is an equation that does not add up			0
‘ many of our members rely on @entity1 ’s postal service , and will struggle as a result of yet another price rise when the service is being cut			1
’ @entity90 mp @entity89 , who sits on the @entity91 which oversees the @entity1 , said the fee was ‘ a tax on business ’ and ‘ a blackmailing surcharge ’			0
@entity96 , @entity3 director for @entity1 , said : ‘ we will continue to collect and deliver six days a week despite the inevitable impact on the capital ’s transport system			0
’ @entity100 of @entity101 said : ‘ we recognise that hosting the @entity3 and @entity11 will throw up logistical challenges for many organisations			1
‘ we ’re satisfied that @entity1 is planning ahead as much as it can , and aims to keep customer disruption to a minimum			0
‘ we would ask customers in @entity18 to bear with @entity1 if their post arrives a little later during the @entity3			0
’ expect traffic jam ' chaos ' on the first three days of the @entity11 unlike many other workers , @entity1 staff will not receive an ‘ olympic bonus ’ , the company said last night			1
they will be paid overtime , worth up to 1.65 times the normal £ 11.97 hourly rate for a postman in inner @entity18 , according to figures from the @entity116			2
@entity16 is having to spend more than £ 1million , employ an extra 260 staff and hire 140 vehicles to keep packages moving during the @entity3 .			2

postmen and women will start their delivery routes earlier because of extra travelling times
congestion cause by the @entity11 will cause postal delays
