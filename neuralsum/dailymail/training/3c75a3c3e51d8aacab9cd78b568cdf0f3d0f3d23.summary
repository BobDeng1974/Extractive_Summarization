by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 18:52 est , 28 december 2013 @entity3 : 18:52 est , 28 december 2013 hopes for a better new year for the 1.3 million @entity5 out of work were crushed today as federal unemployment benefits expired			2
with @entity10 in recess , no last - minute fix is possible meaning that those who have already dipped into savings and made other cutbacks will be left struggling to provide for their families			1
perhaps surprisingly , many of those affected will be middle class workers who had previously earned up to $ 70,000 a year until the recession hit			1
helping hand : figures from the @entity22 show the previous salary brackets of those on @entity25 about 40 per cent of @entity5 who received long - term unemployment benefits since 2008 had been earning $ 30,000 to $ 75,000 before losing their jobs , according to the @entity29			1
previous research by the @entity31 showed more than two thirds of recipients had incomes more than twice the poverty level , the @entity34 reported			0
the figures show that the unemployment insurance , first offered by president @entity39 to provide a safety net for those hit by the recession , is mainly serving the middle class			1
a further problem for some of the job seekers receiving the benefits is that a steady career in a professional field , and advanced age , has limited their ability to find new work			2
one such person is @entity54 , an @entity55 educated lawyer with 23 years ' congressional experience who lost his job in 2012			0
safety net : a graph shows the number of people receiving the benefit , introduced in 2008 to help after the recession widespread : a table shows the number of people in each state who receive the benefit ' i get interviews but lose out in the end because prospective employers tell me my experience makes me " over-qualified " and they do not feel i would stay long in the position if it was offered , ' mr @entity54 told @entity34			0
for just over a year the 49 - year - old has been receiving the unemployment benefit - about $ 430 a week			2
but that came to an end on wednesday			0
mr @entity54 has already made cutbacks , moving to a cheaper home and spending his savings and 401 ( k ) accounts			0
he said he can afford to pay rent for the next three months but if he ca n't find work by then he is not sure what will happen			1
' i 'm in an out of depression mode , ' he said , adding that he had looked at blue collar work but lacks the background or skills needed for that			0
when @entity10 returns on january 6 , president @entity92 and the @entity93 are expected to push to have the benefits renewed			1
the benefits are an extension for the unemployed once their state jobless benefits expire - which in many states happens after 26 weeks			0
republicans are expected to try to block attempts to renew the benefits , but @entity93 have been gaining momentum for their push by highlighting personal stories of some of those about to be cut off			0
they have also seized on a comment made by @entity110 @entity109 who said extended the benefits would be a ' disservice ' and give those out of work less of an incentive to find jobs quickly			1
critical : senator @entity109 has said the benefit was giving the unemployed less of an incentive to find new work push : president @entity92 , pictured in the @entity29 before the holidays , wants the benefit program to be reinstated mr @entity109 's comments hit a nerve with @entity125 , who lost his job and six - figure salary when the bank he was vice-president of was restructured			1
' my motivation is not about getting unemployment benefits			0
my motivation is to get back to where i was , ' the father - of - three said			0
' i understand what [ @entity109 ] is saying , but he is dead wrong			2
' after losing his job , mr @entity125 took a course in project management to add to his professional skills , and extended the area in which he is looking for work			0
but the 54 - year - old has now been unemployed for 14 months , and has been forced to turn to his savings and pension to provide for his family			0
his experiences echo those of tens of thousands of other @entity5 who have been striving to get back into work , and who will now struggle now the benefit has been cut			1
temporary measures to help are being discussed , but with @entity10 away until january 6 no immediate relief will be available			1
president @entity92 has taken time out over the holidays to speak with democrat @entity151 and @entity110 @entity152 , who are sponsoring a measure to temporarily extend the benefits			2
' as the president has repeatedly made clear , it defies economic sense , precedent and our values to allow 1.3 million @entity5 fighting to find jobs to see their unemployment insurance abruptly cut off , ' @entity163 , of the @entity164 , said .			1

40 per cent of those claiming financial aid had been earning up to $ 70,000
older professionals reveal struggle to find work after *redundancy*
@entity110 @entity109 says stopping the benefit , set up under president @entity39 , will encourage *claimants* to quickly find new jobs
no vote to reinstate help will be made until @entity10 returns on january 6
