by @entity0 last updated at 1:38 pm on 4th november 2011 they were cheap and they came in designs that seemed to shout ' @entity5 dude ' as soon as you put on a pair			2
but now the man behind the @entity10 phenomenon has died			2
@entity10 passed away on october 12 at his home in @entity12 , his wife , @entity13 , has revealed			2
co-founder : @entity10 and his brother were behind the @entity10 brand of shoes that became part of skateboarding culture popular : @entity10 canvas shoes were embraced by the skateboard culture and became a nationwide sensation when @entity23 wore a checkerboard pair in the 1982 movie ' @entity26 ' he was 72 and was suffering from cancer			1
mr @entity28 and his older brother @entity29 cooked up their iconic brand of shoes in their family rubber factory in the 1960s			1
almost immediately , they turned out to be the perfect fit for the skateboarding culture that swept southern @entity12			2
but most importantly , once you slipped on a pair of @entity10 , you never fell off your skateboard			0
at least not until you crashed it			0
mr @entity28 , whose background in chemistry and mechanics contributed to that unique , slip - resistant design			1
the brothers were working for a sports shoe company in the 1960s when @entity29 suggested they and two friends form their own business			1
skater culture : a skateboarder wearing vans performs a big ollie over a ramp they would name it @entity10 and create an instantly recognisable logo with a capital v whose elongated tail covered the rest of the word			0
they decided to keep their prices low by cutting out the middle man , choosing to manufacture the shoes themselves and sell them at their own retail store in @entity71			1
initially , the company was so small that its first store carried only display samples			0
a customer would order a pair of shoes and the brothers would go next door to the family rubber factory to make them			1
often they would use patterns and designs the customers had brought in themselves			0
professional skater @entity84 ( right ) watches @entity86 practice before a @entity10 sponsored event but most importantly , they would make the shoes ' soles with a unique , waffle - like design perfect for gripping a wood surface like the top of a skateboard			1
' they got it right the first time			0
the sole they use , it 's called the waffle sole			0
nothing else seems to work nearly as good for skateboarding , ' said @entity103 , a former competitive skater who has been wearing @entity10 for 30 years			0
then , in 1982 , the shoes got a gigantic promotional boost			1
@entity23 , in a breakthrough role that would make him a star , played quintessential stoned surfer - dude @entity26 in the film ' @entity26			1
' and he wore a pair of @entity10 with a distinctive checkerboard design			1
@entity10 trainers are celebrity favourites			1
@entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 are all fans , and @entity121 ( pictured ) is so fond of her checkered pair she wore them to leave her footprints in cement at a @entity126 ceremony yesterday			1
the trainers have been paired with everything from little black dresses to a head - to - toe emo look – and everything in between – bringing a grungy look to any outfit			1
but they were originally intended for a pretty niche market when the first store opened in 1965			0
soon the shoes seemed to be ubiquitous with skateboarding across the country			1
' if you saw another guy wearing @entity10 , you immediately knew they were a skateboarder and you immediately had a connection , ' said @entity103 , 42 , a bicycle mechanic from @entity142 , @entity143 , who still skates for fun			0
' the checkerboard pattern skyrocketed after that , ' recalled @entity147			0
teens continue to wear it to this day , and @entity10 continues to market to alternative youth culture , announcing a collaboration with the rock group @entity152 earlier this year			0
over the years , however , the company did run into some bumps			0
as the sports shoe business exploded in the 1980s , competitors who produced shoes with cheap foreign labor nearly ran @entity10 out of business			1
the company had to seek protection in bankruptcy court			0
' we had kind of gotten away from our sweet spot and off track into athletic shoes that were expensive to make in @entity168 , ' mr @entity28 's nephew @entity163 told the @entity169			2
a court - ordered management shake - up in 1984 led to the departure of @entity10			2
control of the company was returned to his brother @entity29 , who came out of semi-retirement			1
four years later , an investment banking company bought @entity10 , which has been sold several times since			0
in 2004 , @entity10 , then headquartered in @entity179 , was bought by @entity180 , @entity182 - based @entity181 , a clothing company with brands such as @entity186 jeans , @entity181 lingerie and @entity189 outdoor line			2
the @entity10 office is now in @entity191 , where several @entity28 family members still work			0
as for @entity10 , his loyalty to the @entity168 - made shoe never wavered			2
his wife says he wore @entity10 deck shoes ' every day of his life '			1
mr @entity28 's body was cremated and his ashes may be scattered in @entity202			0
a memorial @entity203 is planned for friday at @entity12 's @entity204			0
along with his wife and brother , mr @entity28 leaves his sons @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 ; another brother , @entity212 ; and a sister , @entity213 .			2
