in its press release , @entity0 said : ' the new wearable device will be the 7th generation of @entity9 with a wrist watch type ' @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 currently offer round watches , while the @entity28 and @entity29 are square			1
in its press release , @entity0 said : ' members of global developer community can get early access to the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) of the company 's next generation of the @entity9 device			1
' the new wearable device will be the 7th generation of @entity9 with a wrist watch type			1
' it added that this is the first time @entity0 has released its wearable sdk to developers before the official product announcement , but did n't reveal release dates for either the software or the new device			1
@entity0 's previous watches have all had rectangular faces , including the @entity48 ( pictured left ) , or in the case of the @entity16 ( pictured right ) , a curved design @entity24 ( @entity51 360 pictured ) , @entity25 and @entity26 currently offer round watches , while the @entity28 and @entity29 are square			1
@entity55 , editor - in - chief of @entity56 told @entity57 : ' it 's hardly surprising @entity0 has announced plans for a circular smartwatch , the @entity54 device has been on the web rumour mill for a while ' @entity62 claims the £ 119.99 @entity63 ( shown ) has a 10 - day battery life			1
it goes on sale in may earlier this week @entity62 announced its @entity63 , the first @entity62 wearable designed for fitness tracking			0
it has built - in heart - rate monitoring , sleep tracking , and a happiness index that shows a person 's overall mood			2
it uses a numeric score , based on the wearer 's activity level and sleep quality to shown a summary of how healthy the wearer 's lifestyle is			0
a low score suggest the wearer should adjust their exercise and sleep habits , while a normal or high score provides motivation to maintain their healthy lifestyle			0

elsewhere in the release @entity0 said it has already worked with @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 in developing apps for the next gadget			2
@entity55 , editor - in - chief of @entity56 told @entity57 : ' it 's hardly surprising @entity0 has announced plans for a circular smartwatch , the @entity54 device has been spinning on the web rumour mill for a while now but the timing , on @entity112 launch day , is a little puzzling			1
' @entity0 's betting big on its own proprietary software and it makes sense to get developers in early to pack out the @entity118 app store with circle - friendly apps			1
' after all , with 3,000 @entity124 watch apps reportedly already on offer , the @entity121 company is playing catch - up to its long - time rival , despite the fact it ’s been in the game a lot longer			1
' @entity124 's smartwatch officially went on sale today , but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed as none of its stores have them in stock			2
instead , consumers have to pre-order the watches online or go to select partner shops and boutiques to buy the watch today			0
usually , @entity124 launches generate long queues outside stores			0
but analysts believe the company feared the queues might be ' embarrassingly small ' and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang			0
in fact , despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology , pre-orders have far exceeded expectations			0
as a result , the company 's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today			0
analysts believe @entity124 is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year			0

the @entity186 app is pictured @entity187 , global director of gadget insurer @entity188 , told @entity57 : ' it was rather sad not to see all those technophiles camping outside @entity190 this week			0
' i doubt this new sales strategy will do much harm to sales of the watch , as @entity124 has incredible brand loyalty , but neither should it underestimate the impact those queues had			2
they are the most photographed and talked about queues in the world and i can think of no other brand gets that kind of exposure for a product launch			0
' that queue is more than just brand hype , it 's a phenomenon , and it 's also free global pr for @entity124			2
