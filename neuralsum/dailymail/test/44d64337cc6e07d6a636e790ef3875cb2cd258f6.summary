just another history - making day at this wonderful 79th masters saw @entity1 become the first man ever to have three eagles in one round and yet still he could n’t lay a finger on @entity6			1
following one stunning round with another happens about as often at @entity8 as pieces of litter drifting across the property			1
here , the youngest first - round leader in masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36 - hole record total of 14 under par , beating the old mark of 13 under set by @entity18 way back in 1976			1
it also tied the lowest 36 - hole total seen in a major , set by three others , including sir @entity22 at @entity23			1
@entity6 chips on the 17th hole during the second round of the masters on friday @entity6 watches his tee shot from the 16th in front of a packed crowd at @entity8 the 21 - year - old walks past the scoreboard on the 18th hole following his sensational performance @entity1 eyes up a putt no the 18th green during his record - breaking display on friday @entity1 started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course ’s scoreable par fives to devastating effect			1
he had eagles at the second and the 8th , birdied the 13th , before striking a wondrous blow to the 15th that pulled up 12 inches from the flag			1
the difference between him and @entity6 is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67			1
@entity1 will start the third round seven behind his fellow @entity51 with game chorus line member @entity52 two strokes nearer the lead following a creditable 68			1
@entity57 @entity56 and @entity58 are on the same mark as @entity1 , with the former weighing in with a fine recovery of his own			1
@entity61 was three over par after four holes but rallied strongly after drawing a line on his scorecard , like you ’d draw a line in the sand			2
he played the last 14 holes in a plucky five under for a 70 , while @entity58 underlined he is a man reborn with a terrific bogey - free 68			1
@entity73 lies tied sixth after a 68 , one shot ahead of @entity75 ( 72 ) , while @entity76 shot a commendable 69 , his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors , and his first here since 2011			2
he is still no fewer than 12 shots behind , mind			2
what of the world no 1 , @entity86 ? alas , if it ’s friday it must be time for one of those freaky nine holes that just kill him at the masters every time			2
@entity75 hits a shot off the fourth tee during his second day of action last year it was on the back nine and this time the outward half , as he followed a bogey at the 7th with a double at the 9th to turn in 40 strokes			2
it ’s the sixth year in a row the @entity104 has thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he addresses the problem , he simply can not win a green jacket			2
at least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he has made mentally from the days when his shoulders used to slump			2
one shot outside the projected halfway cut mark , he birdied the 10th and then , at the 13th , the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past , he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap - in eagle three			1
@entity86 missed from 3ft at the 14th for a par but , in a rousing finish , birdied the 15th , 17th and the 18th			2
to the accompaniment of loud rumbles of thunder in the distance , @entity86 came home in just 31 shots to stand alongside @entity76 on two under			0
@entity76 shot a commendable 69 ; his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors @entity76 's girlfriend @entity133 watches on from the crowd during the second day of action @entity137 golfers have a long and proud history of coming up with prodigious feats that stun the sporting world			1
@entity141 once won 11 events in a row on the @entity144 in 1945			0
@entity145 won three major championships in succession in 1953 and probably would have won the fourth as well but for the fact @entity23 clashed that year with the @entity150			0
now here comes @entity6 , who to this point has turned this masters into his very own ‘ hello , world ’ moment with an awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we have n’t seen since another 21 - year - old named @entity76 walked away with the 1997 edition			1
all this on the day another @entity161 legend , @entity161 , waved goodbye to the masters			0
it ’s tempting to talk about a passing of the @entity137 torch , except @entity6 is destined for a level of greatness twice @entity169 champion @entity169 could only dream about			1
think @entity145 rather than @entity170			0
@entity86 reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what was a frustrating day for the @entity174 1 @entity58 tries to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole as for @entity76 , his first round 73 was actually an awful lot better than his score and the reviews suggested			1
it was , in fact , the most encouraging signs we ’ve seen for him for well over a year			0
his short game was back to its best and his task on friday was to instil some rhythm in his long game			0
that is exactly what happened			0
the rare sight of him finding the first fairway was encouraging and even better was the laser iron that followed			0
it finished 10ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole			1
for 15 minutes , it was like watching @entity76 at his best			0
the rest of the round was also heartening			2
he reached the turn in 34 to be one under for the event and inside the top 20			0
@entity56 flips his club into the air after the @entity212 golfer cleared a sand trap on the 13th green @entity161 closed out his @entity216 career with two mediocre rounds at @entity8 a birdie at the 11th and he was on the fringes of the top ten			1
how he does over the final two rounds is one more fascinating question during a weekend featuring many			0
@entity75 was trying to build on the small miracle of his opening 67			0
the @entity226 finished eighth on his @entity8 debut in 1994			0
two months later , at the age of 25 , he claimed the @entity231			0
everyone looked at his languid grace off the tee and gossamer touch around the greens and wondered how many green jackets he would win			0
twenty years on , he ’s still waiting for his first			0
but he ’s still in there trying			0
depending on your viewpoint , his 72 leaves him perfectly placed to take advantage if @entity6 feels the pressure over the weekend ; or well in the mix to notch his third runner - up finish at the masters			1
@entity73 lies tied sixth after a 68 just one shot ahead of @entity75			0

@entity6 is the youngest first - round leader in @entity216 history
@entity6 set a new 36 - hole record with his 14 - under total
