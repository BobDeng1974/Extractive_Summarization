it may be another 149 days until @entity1 begin their @entity3 campaign against @entity4 at @entity5 , but @entity1 assistant coach @entity6 can already feel the excitement building across the country			1
@entity10 ’s side will take on the @entity11 in the @entity3 curtain - raiser on september 18 at @entity13 in a tournament that will encompass 48 matches spread across 44 days of action			1
‘ @entity1 is going to be the sport of the year with the @entity3 coming up , ’ said @entity6			1
@entity6 says rugby union is going to be the sport of the year with the @entity3 coming up in @entity1 ‘ it 's as though the tournament is going to start in a few weeks ’ time			1
if it ’s already like it is now , i think we 'll never have seen anything like it come @entity3 time			1
the important thing on the back of that is obviously seizing the opportunity for the legacy after it			0
‘ i 've absolutely no doubt that this is going to be the biggest @entity3 ever			1
you go to places like @entity37 or @entity38 ; you see the buzz around the place because they know it 's coming			2
it 's going to be fantastic			2
’ @entity1 came within six points of claiming the @entity45 following their pulsating 55 - 35 victory against @entity47 on the final day of the championship – as @entity49 secured a second successive title on points difference			1
it was the fourth consecutive time that @entity1 had finished second in the championship , but @entity6 saw plenty of positives with international rookies like @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 impressing throughout while established campaigners such as @entity61 and @entity62 looked rejuvenated			1
‘ coming into the @entity3 , we 're in a great place , ’ @entity6 explained			2
‘ there were a few injuries before the @entity45 and people got their opportunity			0
a lot of people took those opportunities			0
we 're fortunate now that when we pick a 31 - man squad ; all these guys will have had some experience at international level			1
‘ not just experience , but in pressure situations like the @entity79 game for example			0
we ’re certainly going to have a squad full of people that can certainly cope in this environment			0
’ the @entity1 assistant coach says @entity1 are in great shape ahead of the tournament this summer @entity1 will begin their preparations for the tournament with a two - week training camp at @entity90 in early july			1
the squad will then embark on a trip to @entity93 in @entity94 for a fortnight of high - intensity training at high - altitude before returning for three warm - up games against @entity47 ( twice ) and @entity49 prior to the tournament			2
@entity1 must name a 31 - man @entity3 squad by august 31 and @entity6 admits that some tough selection calls lay ahead			1
‘ the first train - on squad , we could pick up to 50 players			2
there 'll be good players disappointed that they 've not got into that squad ! ‘ imagine taking it down to 31 - there 's going to be a lot of players , good players , missing out on what is dream playing in a home @entity3 so it 's a big thing for us selection because you 've got to get it right … it 's so important			1
‘ we 're together for at least three months before the competition starts which will hopefully be seven weeks long for us so it 's a hell of a long time together so we have to make sure that we break it up			0
’ it does n’t get any easier once the tournament begins as @entity1 will look to qualify from a group that also contains @entity125 heavyweights @entity126 and @entity127			1
@entity1 missed out on the @entity45 title despite an impressive victory against @entity47 @entity6 ( right ) says @entity10 ( left ) has some tough decisions to make in terms of selection home advantage may prove decisive and @entity6 cites the @entity5 factor as a major fillip for his side ahead of the tournament			1
‘ obviously , @entity5 's our home			0
it 's a bit of a fortress for us			0
we play very well here			0
the crowd always gets behind us			0
they are the 16th man			0
we 've been fortunate over the last three years			0
you ca n't actually nail your hat on which was the best atmosphere now because there 's been so many of them			0
‘ the @entity152 game , all the @entity154 games , the @entity156 games or the last game here ( against @entity47 ) - they 're all pretty special			2
following their meetings with @entity4 , @entity126 and @entity127 at @entity5 , @entity1 will play their final @entity161 game against minnows @entity162 at the @entity163 in @entity164			1
and @entity6 , who was born and bred in @entity165 , is thrilled that @entity1 are venturing out of the capital during the tournament			2
‘ it 's going to be great for us to get up north because there 's a lot of northerners in our side anyway , ’ @entity6 added			2
‘ it 'll be great to get back to our roots and show the people of @entity164 what it 's about as well			0
we want to feel the buzz around the whole country behind us not just people down here			0
