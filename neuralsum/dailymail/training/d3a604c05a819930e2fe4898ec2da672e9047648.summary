@entity0 has condemned @entity2 's ' angry and desperate @entity1 ' after vice president @entity3 told a largely @entity5 crowd that the @entity6 were ' going to put y'all back in chains '			1
vice president @entity3 made the race blunder while declaring @entity6 wanted to ' unchain @entity11 '			1
but his comment sparked a furious reaction from @entity0 , who accused the @entity2 campaign of race - baiting and promoting politics of hate			1
' his campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the @entity1			1
another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in @entity49			2
and the @entity50 sinks a little bit lower			2
' his campaign has resorted to diversions and distractions , to demagoguing and defaming others			2
this is an old game in politics ; what ’s different this year is that the president is taking things to a new low			2
' @entity3 later clarified his comment , insisting he was merely using the same phrases the @entity6 had used - but admitting he said ' unchained ' instead of ' unshackled '			1
his full statement is shown below			2
the @entity0 campaign got an energy boost over the weekend when he announced his selection of @entity70 congressman @entity69 as his running mate			1
vice president @entity3 made controversial statements while in @entity73			1
more than 50 percent of the @entity75 's population is @entity5 bringing it down : @entity0 criticized @entity2 , seen here at an event in @entity78 , and his surrogates for ' sinking ' the @entity50 because of the tone of their discourse on the campaign trail ' @entity84 ' ? @entity69 was selected as @entity0 's vice presidential nominee , a role that is typically thought of as the more aggressive of the two though the vice president is largely seen as the ' attack dog ' in presidential campaigns , in a supposed effort to keep the top - of - the - ticket from appearing too negative , tuesday night 's speech by @entity0 shows that he is not afraid to throw some punches			1
the @entity2 campaign responded in kind , saying that it was not biden or the president who were disrespecting the @entity97 but @entity0 with his plethora of negative ads. ' governor @entity0 's comments tonight seemed unhinged , and particularly strange coming at a time when he 's pouring tens of millions of dollars into negative ads that are demonstrably false , ' @entity2 campaign spokesman @entity100 said in response to @entity0 's speech			1
critiques of negative ads have gone both ways , however , as a pac that supports @entity2 was widely panned after it released an ad where a retired steel worker blamed @entity0 's venture capital firm for firing him , prompting him to lose his health insurance , which the man then said caused his wife to die of cancer			1
' whether its accusing @entity0 of being a felon , having been responsible for a woman ’s tragic death or now wanting to put people in chains , there ’s no question that because of the president ’s failed record he ’s been reduced to a desperate campaign based on division and demonization , ' @entity0 campaign spokesman @entity129 said , referencing the @entity131 advertisement			1
the latest @entity133 composite poll has @entity2 coming in at 47.6 per cent , leading by 3.7 to @entity0 ’s 43.9 per cent			1
' we do n't have to imagine any more			2
here ’s what congressman @entity69 said			2
he said , " we believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy			0
" ' the speaker of the house said , used the word " unshackled " as well , referring to their proposals			0
the last time these guys unshackled the economy , to use their term , they put the middle class in shackles			2
that ’s how we got where we are			0
' nine million jobs lost			0
sixteen trillion dollars in wealth you all lost in your home equity , in your @entity160 and your pension plans			0
you ’re the ones that got nailed			0
all of @entity163 , except the very few			0
' and i ’m told that when i made that comment earlier today in @entity73 , @entity49 , the @entity0 campaign put out a tweet			1
you know , tweets these days ? put out a tweet , went on the airwaves saying , " @entity3 , he ’s outrageous in saying that			1
" i think i said instead of " unshackled " , " unchained "			0
' @entity172 to say that			0
that ’s what we had			0
i ’m using their own words			0
i got a message for them			0
if you want to know what 's outrageous , it 's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class @entity163			0
that ’s what ’s outrageous			0
' watch the videos here , p >			0

vice president @entity3 said @entity6 will ' put y'all in chains ' to a largely @entity5 audience on tuesday
@entity0 responded saying @entity2 and his surrogates were *launching* a ' campaign of division and anger and hate '
