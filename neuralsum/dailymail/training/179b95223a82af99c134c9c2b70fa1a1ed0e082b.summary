the former @entity34 and @entity35 secondary school teacher said : ' i 've been watching programmes on television about food banks and people by themselves being in trouble			2
' every time my post comes there is a request for money , and i thought rather than send the money abroad , why not help local people ? ' i just thought it was the sort of gesture i could make to people in the local community who might be in trouble			1
that was my only intention			0
' mrs @entity0 , who does n't have any children , has since received donations of more than £ 1,000 from as far as @entity59 and @entity60 after her news of her plight went international			1

i was an only child , my husband was an only child , and we live miles away from other relatives			2
' my nearest relatives at the moment are in @entity71 or @entity72 - a long way away			0
' she first approached the town 's mayor , @entity75 , to see if he thought the idea was reasonable and after little persuasion he stepped in to help organise the event			0
he said : ' it 's a very kind gesture			1
i think it is because she has been on her own			0
' it is people who would n't be having a @entity5 lunch or spending it alone			1
most of them are local people and they are mostly elderly			2
' he added that the lunch on tuesday , december 23 , for those who live in the parish will start at 12.30pm			0

at the full price , such a spread will cost £ 21.95 per person for food and £ 14.95 per bottle of wine - a total of £ 1,097.50 if 50 people turn up			1
however , the pub is offering an undisclosed discount			0

they thought it was lovely			0
in the town , it 's all been very positive			0
' she [ mrs @entity0 ] hopes to come but she said do n't count on it			2
if she does come , i will say the generous lady is here and we will give her a round of applause			0
