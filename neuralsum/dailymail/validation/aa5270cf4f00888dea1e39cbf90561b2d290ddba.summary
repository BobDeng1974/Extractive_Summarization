thankfully a group of locals spotted the attack and managed to save the boy 's life gruesome : the attack is understood to have been a sickening imitation of the brutal murder of @entity10 pilot @entity37 , who was burnt alive by @entity40 earlier this year local journalist @entity41 was told about the attack and posted details of it on his @entity46 page , according to @entity47			1
the boys are understood to have been inspired by murders committed by @entity40 after using mobile phone apps such as @entity51 to share gruesome videos of the terror group 's atrocities , despite living in a remote village where electricity supplies are unreliable			1
during the attack , the boys are said to have assumed different terrorist roles , with the ' leader ' sitting in a chair and giving orders to his friends			2
after being set alight , the boys cries were overheard by local residents who rushed to save him			1
' the villagers took him to a local hospital where he received treatment for burns to one of his legs , ' mr @entity41 was quoted as saying			0

flames are seen quickly spreading across the dirt to the cage , where they completely engulf the helpless pilot in images that are far too distressing to publish			0
extremists pour debris , including broken masonry , over the cage , which is then flattened by a bulldozer			0
the horrific murder led to @entity10 immediately executing two @entity40 prisoners and carrying out an unprecedented number of attacks on the terror group in @entity106			2
lined up on the beach : the group of young boys in @entity2 are forced to their knees and stare down at the sand whilst they await their mock execution chilling : the video bares a striking resemblance to @entity40 ' real murder video of 21 @entity116 on a beach in @entity118 and suggests the young boys have been studying the footage intently sickening : the video in @entity2 shows five young boys , aged around 10 - years - old and wearing only trousers , being led to a beach by five teenagers the real thing : each boy appears deep in character , honed from studying the authentic @entity130 murder video news of the attack on the 10 - year - old boy in @entity2 came just weeks after video emerged showing a group of young @entity2 boys reenacting the brutal murder of 21 @entity139 militants in @entity118			1
the grainy mobile phone footage was reportedly filmed somewhere on the @entity141 in @entity2			0
it shows five young boys , possibly aged around 10 - years - old , wearing only trousers , being led to a beach by five teenage boys			1
the teenage boys are fully dressed and their faces are covered by scarfs to imitate the masked murderers from the sickening islamic state execution video			0
on the way to the beach , the older boys each pick up a stick , mimicking the collecting of knives by the executioners in the beheading video of 21 @entity106 soldiers released in november 2014			2
lined up on the beach , the young boys are forced to their knees and stare down at the sand whilst they await their mock execution			0

an @entity168 couple horrified guests at their wedding by hiring fake jihadis to hijack the ceremony and force them in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a @entity10 pilot			2
the marriage ceremony was held in @entity178 , north of @entity179 and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point			0
the only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend ' attack ' in advance were the groom , his best men and wedding photographer @entity191 - although the bride is said to have been told to expect something ' different ' from the ceremony			0
hijacked : the marriage ceremony was held in @entity178 , north of @entity179 , and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point trapped : the fake jihadis took control of the ceremony and force the bride and groom in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a @entity10 pilot it is unclear from the video whether the bride and groom are @entity208 or @entity209			2
video footage of the ceremony shows one of the groom 's knife - wielding best men wearing a black balaclava and religious song - known as a nasheed - that has previously featured prominently in genuine islamic state propaganda videos			2
having stormed the stage , the men force the couple to climb in to a cage in a chilling imitation of the @entity40 video that showed @entity10 pilot @entity226 being burnt alive earlier this year			1
the only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend ' attack ' in advance were the as yet unnamed groom , his best men and wedding photographer @entity191			0
