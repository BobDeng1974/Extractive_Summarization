new direction : @entity2 mp @entity1 believes the all illegal immigrants should be given an amnesty to remain in the country all illegal immigrants in @entity7 should be granted an amnesty to stay in the country , a @entity2 mp has said			1
@entity1 , mp for @entity11 , argued that the move makes sense economically and that a ' seismic ' shift in policy is needed for the @entity2 to attract votes among minority groups			1
but it would represent a major switch in political direction for the party			2
earlier this week chancellor @entity22 announced that immigrants who claim benefits will have to learn @entity25 or see their handouts docked			0
mr @entity1 told @entity27 : ' we should n't be afraid to think outside our comfort zone			1
our failure to appeal to ethnic minorities should send loud alarm bells ringing in @entity33 and @entity34			0
' unless we act now this electoral penalty will only get worse			0
' the @entity36 won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the election in 2010			1
lord @entity39 is among those who has told @entity41 he must do more to woo the ethnic vote			2
he recently released details of a poll showing that ethnic minority voters share the @entity2 creed that ‘ if you work hard , it is possible to be very successful in @entity7 ’			0
but when asked which party shares their values , they opt for @entity52 by a margin of more than two to one			0
the offer of an amnesty to illegal immigrants was a manifesto pledge of the @entity58 at the last election but was dramatically ditched by leader @entity60 earlier this year			1
he said the policy risked undermining public confidence in the entire immigration system			0
conflict : @entity66 mayor @entity65 , left , is a long - term supporter of an amnesty for illegal immigrants but deputy prime minister @entity60 , right , recently ditched his party 's support for the policy the deputy prime minister instead unveiled new plans to force foreigners arriving in @entity7 from ‘ high risk countries ’ to pay a bond of more than £ 1,000 which will only be repaid when they leave			2
however , the @entity66 mayor @entity65 has been a long - term supporter of an amnesty for an estimated half a million immigrants in the @entity7			2
mr @entity65 claims an amnesty would help the economy and the @entity80 by allowing huge numbers of illegal immigrants to work openly and to pay tax and national insurance - a position supported by some union bosses and church leaders			0
a study commissioned by mr @entity65 from the @entity88 estimates there are 618,000 illegal immigrants in the @entity7 , of which 442,000 - almost three quarters - live in the capital			0
but other senior @entity36 have said that such an offer would send out a message to immigrants that it is possible to enter the country illegally and stay forever			1
sir @entity98 , of the campaign group @entity99 , said opinion polls showed 70 per cent of the public oppose an immigration amnesty .			1

@entity1 says amnesty makes political and economic sense
' we should n't be afraid to think outside our comfort zone , ' he says
@entity36 won just 16 per cent of non-white vote at 2010 election
