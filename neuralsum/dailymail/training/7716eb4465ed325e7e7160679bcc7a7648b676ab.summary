fossilised faeces suggests an ancient baby shark might have been killed by its dinner			2
@entity5 palaeontologists analysing a 70 million - year - old fossilised poo from an extinct newborn shark found it ate a baby turtle shortly before it died			1
the researchers think the shark , living close to the @entity13 coastline , bit off more than it could digest and probably died as a result			2
@entity5 palaeontologists analysing a 70 million - year - old fossilised poo from an extinct newborn shark found it ate a baby turtle shortly before it died @entity20 , a palaeontologist at @entity21 in @entity22 , told @entity23 : ‘ it 's a case where a newborn shark ate a newborn turtle and died			1
' the fossilised poo , which is also known as a coprolite , measures almost four centimetres long and was discovered in a fossil bed close to the @entity13 coastline			1
between 70 million and 80 million years ago , the area was where the baby shark was born - in a tidal estuary where the sea met inland rivers			0
inside the coprolite ( pictured ) are some minute turtle vertebrae measuring just 3mm long professor @entity20 believes the size of the coprolite indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn			1
inside the coprolite , which was described by the professor at the 73rd annual meeting of the @entity47 , are some minute turtle vertebrae			0
each bone measures around three millimetres long , indicating the turtle must have been a newborn too			2
he believes the turtle that was eaten was a soft - shell species living in freshwater , while the small shark lived in the sea , indicating the fish had just come out of a pupping ground in the estuary , where the baby sharks hatched			1
showing its predatory nature , the shark must have emerged from the pupping ground and almost immediately ate the newborn turtle , which probably only measured 10 centimetres in diameter , according to professor @entity20			2
he believes the shark was probably not much larger than its dinner as the vertebrae in the fish ’s faeces indicate			0
he also believes the shark died shortly after forcing down the meal			0
professor @entity20 believes the size of the coprolite , which measures almost 4cm long , indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn professor @entity20 said : ‘ it 's possible the turtle was too much shell			1
[ the shark ] may have died from too much turtle			0
while professor @entity20 is not sure about the exact species of the shark and turtle , he thinks the shark could be the extinct @entity87			0
scientists studying other shark coprolites have previously found some fish had tapeworms 270 million years ago .			0

a paleontologist at @entity21 believes the size of the fossil indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn
tiny vertebrae inside the fossilised poo indicate the shark 's last meal was a newborn soft - shell turtle not much smaller than itself
the fossilised poo measures almost four centimetres long and was discovered in a fossil bed close to the @entity13 coastline
