moors murderer @entity0 was so addicted to @entity1 that she wrote to the home secretary begging him not to cut her supply			1
secret letters published today for the first time reveal the dark chapter in the killer 's final years behind bars			1
the notes also show how @entity0 asked for permission to be hypnotised so that she could remember the location of the grave of her final victim - 12 - year - old @entity13			1
but officials later became concerned with her dependence on @entity1 - and described her appearance as ' doped up to the eyeballs '			1
her daily prescription to the drug was cut two years later - prompting her to write a six - page letter to the then @entity33 home secretary @entity17 - saying how @entity1 helped to relieve ' pressure and trauma ' in prison			1
' i have used it many times into my sentence , particularly when there have been major crises , ' she wrote , 23 years into her life term			0
she adds : ' since i 'm not asking to be released there 's no particular point in preserving my body for a healthy and ripe old age in prison			2
she goes on to describe how @entity1 is the only thing that kept her going in jail			0
uncovered : her letter was marked and sealed until 2072 but was among papers released when she died in @entity54 's @entity53 in 2002			2
it was only recently unearthed by a @entity57 academic read killer 's letter : home secretary in 1989 , @entity17 , received a six - page handwritten letter from child murderer @entity0 asking she be supplied with @entity1 again the killer , who murdered at least five children with evil lover @entity64 , even moaned about ' a series of upsetting and disturbing letters ' from @entity64 - mother of @entity13 , who was still missing at the time			1
the letter to @entity17 was dated march 1 1989 and hypocritically appealed to the home secretary to end mrs @entity73 's ordeal			1
she asked @entity17 if she could be hypnotised to help locate the murdered boy 's remains			1
but the former home secretary was warned that evidence obtained might not be admissible in law and could lead to other undesirable requests			0
killer and final victim : pictured left , @entity64 , who killed at least five children in the 1960s with lover @entity0 , including 12 - year - old @entity13 , right he also did not believe the hypnosis would work and rejected her request			1
later the government went back on the decision - but by that point @entity0 was too ill for any form of therapy			0
her letter was marked and sealed until 2072 but was among papers released when she died aged 60 in @entity54 's @entity53 in 2002			2
the prison confirmed she used @entity1 in 1987 and 1988 , when her father @entity95 died			0
dr @entity96 , a @entity57 academic researching a book about @entity0 , recently uncovered the letters amid a pile of jumbled documents at the @entity101 in @entity102			0
@entity0 's records are said to fill 20ft of shelves			0
wrote to @entity0 : @entity64 , the mother of murdered 12 - year - old @entity13 , wrote to @entity0 in prison asking her to tell police where to find the remains of her son			1
she died in 2012 @entity0 wrote the letter to the home secretary from @entity53 in @entity54 ( above ) in 1989 dr @entity96 told @entity113 on sunday : ' they give a fascinating insight into @entity0 's last few years and her reliance on @entity1			2
at no stage does she show remorse - quite the opposite			0
' speaking to the @entity120 , he adds : ' like many of @entity0 's writings , the the letter totally ignores the gravity of what she did			2
' the tone is quite strange			0
it is quite self - righteous , as if someone else has committed the murders and she was helping solve them			0

secret letter reveals how killer used drug to escape ' pressure and trauma '
when police got her to locate kids ' graves , she was ' doped up to eyeballs '
so officers cut supply in 1989 - prompting *desperate* letter to @entity17
in six - page note she also moaned about getting letters from victim 's mum
demanded she be hypnotised to help remember location of murdered 12 - year - old boy 's remains
