by @entity0 and @entity1 when they decided to put an extension on their home , @entity2 and @entity3 were simply hoping for extra space to enjoy family life			1
but instead , they discovered their modern property was playing host to a macabre echo of history			0
underneath their back garden a builder found the partial skeletons of at least two @entity19 prisoners captured in the @entity20			1
uncovered : the centuries - old remains of these @entity19 prisoners of war were found buried behind a house in @entity25 , @entity26 the chilling remains , including part of a jaw with three teeth still in it , were buried behind the £ 400,000 four - bedroom detached house on an estate in @entity25 , @entity26			1
experts established the bones are of two or three ‘ well built ’ men and their state of preservation suggests they are up to 300 years old			1
thousands of prisoners were captured and brought back to @entity41 where they were incarcerated during the conflict with @entity44 from 1803 to 1815			0
shock : @entity2 and @entity3 were unaware of the macabre remains under their garden but mr @entity3 , 45 , a software consultant , knew nothing of this when he looked out of the window one day and saw two policemen in his garden talking to the builder			1
he went outside and was shown about 40 bones			0
for a heart - stopping moment the couple , who have two teenage daughters , feared they were at the centre of a mystery worthy of their favourite crime drama , silent witness			0
mrs @entity64 , 42 , who works in sales , said : ‘ it was a huge shock			0
we are huge fans of the tv programme but we certainly did not expect to find bodies buried in the garden			0
‘ our builder had found some bones			1
at first he thought they were animal remains but then he found a larger bone and guessed it was human ... he called his boss , who told him to phone the police			1
’ a crime scene forensic officer was unable to date the bones so he sent them to @entity82 to be examined by archaeologists			2
the couple ’s new - build property is near @entity86 , where around 7,000 @entity19 prisoners were held during the @entity20 because existing jails were full			1
archaeologist @entity89 , of @entity26 council , said the @entity92 ’ home also lies about 100 yards from the site of a prison hospital from the conflict			2
similar burials were found nearby 30 years ago			2
captured : the @entity19 skeletons are though to have been soldiers in @entity44 's army , which was defeated at the @entity100 , shown above captured @entity19 were held on @entity102 ships in nearby @entity104 harbour , from the 1770s to 1850s			2
many died from diseases , but it is not known how those in the @entity92 ’ garden met their fate			0
mrs @entity64 said : ‘ the archaeologist asked us whether we would allow them to rebury the bones in the garden and we agreed … now we have got used to the idea , we are quite excited about it			0

@entity2 and @entity3 *unearthed* the bones in @entity25 , @entity26
builders found the remains while *preparing* the ground for an extension
it was feared they could be *recent* remains and forensic tests were ordered
but the *results* showed the remains could be as old as 300 years old
it is though they were @entity19 pows from the @entity20 in 1800s
