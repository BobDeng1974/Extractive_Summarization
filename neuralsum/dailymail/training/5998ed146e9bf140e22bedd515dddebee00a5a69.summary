a judge 's ' game - changing ' decision to tell the ex-wife of a millionaire racehorse surgeon to ‘ get a job ’ could mean that more divorced women will now have to support themselves after children turn seven			1

mrs @entity8 had argued for continued maintenance to support their two children , but this was thrown out at the @entity44 yesterday and she was urged to get back to work			1

' never mind about a levels or a degree or taking the bar course — come out and find a footballer , ' she said			0
@entity158 : lord @entity11 , sitting in the @entity159 in @entity119 ( pictured ) , rejected the application by @entity161 , which could change how maintenance is now paid in the @entity77 victory : mr @entity31 , left , said it was not fair he was expected to support his wife long into retirement when she refused to work she believes that couples should settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding and this would stop women marrying successful men and then running off with a large share of their wealth			1
