a team of archaeologists come across a shaman sculpture in an underground burial chamber in the state of @entity5 , @entity6 he has been guarding a tomb for over 1,500 years			1
and only now have a team of archaeologists come across a shaman sculpture in an underground burial chamber in the state of @entity5 , @entity6			1
it is unusual to find one of the statues intact as many have fallen victim to tomb raiders over the centuries			1
the sculpture has a long face and holds a weapon - probably an axe - to guard the shaft tomb which was covered over by slabs of volcanic rock			0
it was uncovered by archaeologists at the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) who have become the first people to see the sculpture in hundreds of years			2
archaeologist @entity31 explained that the model was found in the entrance of an underground funerary space in @entity35			1
' with regards to the figure of the shaman , he was found upright and is holding some kind of weapon , probably an axe			2
he was placed exactly at the entrance , towards the crypt			0
he is some kind of a guardian of the main character deposited inside the shaft tomb , ' he said			0
sites nearby have recently revealed burials of around 35 adults and three infants in cists - small stone coffin - like boxes or used to hold bodies from a slightly later period			0
the square shaft , which is around one - and - a - half metres deep , is thought to date to between 300 ad and @entity58 and leads to an underground vault measuring approximately two metres squared , containing bones of either one or two individuals , physical anthropologist @entity57 explained			2
they could have been moved to the sides of the vault to make way for another individual who was found lying on his back , who was presumably buried slightly later			0
six pots of different sizes ( pictured ) were also recovered there is a theory that shaft tombs were used as homage to people ’s ancestors as well as where people and shaman sculptures were buried			0
six pots of different sizes and an earthenware bowl called a tecomate were also found in the shaft , along with the shaman figure , which measures 19.7inches ( 51cm )			1
the objects will be painstakingly cleaned in a bid to recover any traces of seed or other organic material , which could shed light on how the ancient people lived			0

six pots of different sizes and an earthenware bowl called a tecomate were also found in the shaft , along with the shaman figure , which measures 19.7inches ( 51cm ) in height other shaman figures discovered from the time are less stylised and more representative of the ancient people , some of whom practiced cranial deformation to elongate their heads			1
it is believed that burials of this kind belonged to elite members of society as only richer people had the resources to fund such constructions			0
dogs were also buried with important people at the time as a guide to the underworld for the deceased and archaeologists have recovered what they think are dog ’s teeth from the @entity35 site , hinting that those laid to rest there were of high social standing			2
