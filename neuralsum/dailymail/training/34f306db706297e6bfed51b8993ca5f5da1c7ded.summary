i would class any snake bite that does n't cause a serious injury to be a lucky escape			1
i wo n't lie , it did hurt a bit			0
' we are going to have a full investigation but it was just an accident			0
i 'm hoping to be out of hospital soon			0

' king cobras are the longest of all venomous snakes and can reach 18.5ft			0
they live mainly in the rain forests and plains of @entity99 , southern @entity100 , and @entity101 - and their coloring can vary greatly from region to region			0
the venom from a single bite , whilst not as potent as some species , is still strong enough to kill an elephant or 20 people			0
king cobras are cannibalistic and their main source of food is other snakes			0
when threatened , the king cobra raises itself up , extends its hood and emits a bone - chilling hiss that sounds like a growling dog			0
