by @entity0 and @entity1 poverty is not a barrier to success at school , a respected international organisation said yesterday			2
factors such as poorly educated parents and run - down neighbourhoods condemn underprivileged families to a cycle of ‘ social disadvantage ’ , according to some education experts			2
but the @entity14 dismissed the assumption as a ‘ myth ’			2
research shows children from disadvantaged backgrounds in some countries outperform the wealthiest children in other nations in maths , it said			1
poverty is not a barrier to success at school , a respected international organisation said yesterday the poorest ten per cent of pupils in @entity31 are generally more advanced than the richest 20 per cent of children in the @entity33 , for example			1
the gap between wealthy @entity31 children and underprivileged @entity33 children is equivalent to six years of education by the age of 15			1
in the @entity42 , children from the poorest families can be up to a year ahead of a child from a similar background in the @entity33 at the same age			1
the findings suggest the social and economic background of a pupil is far less important than the quality of the teaching in their school and the education system in which it operates			0
@entity14 spokesman @entity55 said the data ‘ debunks the myth that poverty is destiny ’			0
his intervention will lend weight to the argument of those who say fundamental problems in education should be addressed to help more poor children go to university rather than so - called social engineering , under which top universities have been encouraged to accept candidates with lower grades if they come from deprived backgrounds			1
details were released the day after @entity74 said money matters in education but not as much as ‘ attitude - ambition , expectation - an ethos of excellence ’			0
the @entity80 said improvements in a range of areas including the curriculum , exams , discipline and the quality of teaching meant the days of the ‘ bog standard ’ comprehensive were numbered as state schools catch up with the independent sector			0
details were released the day after @entity74 said money matters in education but not as much as ' attitude - ambition , expectation - an ethos of excellence ' interviewed on @entity98 ’s @entity97 yesterday , he added the flexibility being handed to maintained schools meant they had freedoms similar to those of fee - paying institutions , like choosing whether to set homework or dedicating every afternoon to extra-curricular activities to build character			0
‘ all that i really want to do is to try and make sure that children from poorer homes , whose parents ca n’t afford private schools , get an education every bit as good , ’ he said			1
the @entity14 analysis was based on tests sat by tens of thousands of 15 - year - olds in 40 developed countries or major economic regions in 2012 - before @entity120 reforms began to take effect			2
these have already shown that the @entity33 remained a middle - ranking nation overall under @entity124 despite tens of billions extra being pumped into education			1
further research into the maths skills of the most deprived ten per cent of pupils found those in big - spending @entity33 were not keeping pace with high - performing areas such as @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity31 and @entity134 in @entity135			1
mr @entity55 added : ‘ poverty is n’t destiny			0
for example the poorest 15 - year - olds in @entity31 ... do as well as the ten per cent most privileged students in the @entity141 and 20 per cent in the @entity33			1
‘ the data clearly show that , for many countries , the issue is not just with poor kids in poor neighbourhoods but with many kids in many neighbourhoods			2
‘ the bottom line is that the country where you go to school seems to have a much greater impact on your learning outcome than the social background of your family or even your country			0
’ @entity158 , of the @entity159 , said mr @entity74 was ‘ absolutely right ’ to say attitude trumps funding			0
but he added : ‘ the @entity14 figures show how vastly better our competitors are doing			0
‘ we get complacent about our top schools but they are doing pretty badly on the international scale			0
