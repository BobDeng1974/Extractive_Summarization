former @entity2 administration @entity1 chief @entity0 said sunday that the president overruled nearly his entire national security team and decided not to arm moderate @entity6 rebel groups early on , a decision that helped the @entity9 terror army gain power			1
@entity0 also said he favored leaving a residual force of @entity13 troops behind in @entity14 instead of withdrawing them , another opinion @entity2 ignored			2
@entity0 , who was @entity2 's @entity15 director for two years before leading the @entity1 for two more , told @entity16 that entering the @entity6 conflict earlier , and ensuring that moderate groups gained power instead of the most extreme jihadi elements , could have prevented @entity9 from growing and prospering			1
' i think that would 've helped , ' @entity0 said			2
' and i think , in part , we pay the price for not doing that in what we see happening with @entity9			0
' and a less complete troop pullout in @entity14 ' would 've given us greater leverage over @entity14 's government , ' he emphasized			1
former defense secretary @entity0 was also previously the @entity15 director under @entity2 , and served as @entity33 's @entity32 chief of staff nearly @entity2 's entire national security team recommended arming moderate @entity6 rebel groups who opposed dictator @entity37 @entity2 now stands widely accused of standing by while @entity9 , the self - proclaimed @entity38 , established a base of operations in eastern @entity6 and threatened to overthrow @entity37 , while simultaneously marching across more than half of @entity14			1
his $ 500 million ' train and equip ' mission there , critics say , is too late to do more than temporarily contain the group			0
@entity0 writes in his forthcoming memoir ' @entity48 ' that he urged @entity2 in a 2012 meeting to arm @entity37 's less - rabid foes – and that then - secretary of state @entity53 , then - @entity15 director @entity51 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity52 all agreed			1
@entity33 , now a presumptive @entity55 presidential front - runner , said in an august interview that it was an @entity2 ' failure ' to leave @entity6 's rebels to fend for themselves , a decision that ' left a big vacuum , which the jihadists have now filled			1
' speaking to @entity62 , former president @entity33 said sunday that he also agreed with his wife at the time			0
@entity2 deputy national security adviser @entity64 said in a statement last month that in 2012 the president ' wanted to make sure that we were providing assistance to people who we knew , so that it would n't fall into the wrong hands given how many extremists were operating in that area , ' @entity33 disagreed			2
the revelations come from @entity0 's memoir which is due out on october 7 discord : @entity0 ( left ) and @entity76 ( right ) both counseled @entity2 to strengthen @entity6 's rebels two years ago but he refused ' since @entity9 has plenty of money – it 's one of the great bank robbers in human history , among other things – they were going to get their weapons one way or the other , ' he said , ' so i would have risked it			1
' ' and besides , when we were talking about doing it , there was no @entity9			0
however , it was an argument she lost within the administration			0
' @entity0 said sunday that ' it 's going to take a long time ' to defeat a defiant and strengthened @entity9 , ' and i think the @entity13 people need to know it 's going to take a long time			0
' the group is ' as dangerous , as fanatical as terrorists as @entity100 was , ' he said			0
' and they have a large number of foreign fighters with foreign passports that make them particularly dangerous to the safety of this country			0

@entity0 said ' we pay the price ' because @entity2 decided to overrule his secretary of state , @entity15 director and chairman of the @entity113
asked if @entity2 made a mistake by refusing to arm moderate @entity6 rebels early on , @entity0 said ' that would 've helped '
he also *clashed* with @entity2 's @entity14 *policy* , saying that leaving some troops behind ' would 've given us greater leverage over @entity14 's government
in august @entity53 said it was a ' failure ' to leave @entity6 's rebels to fend for themselves , and ' left a big vacuum , which the jihadists have now filled '
@entity33 now says ' it was an argument she lost within the administration '
