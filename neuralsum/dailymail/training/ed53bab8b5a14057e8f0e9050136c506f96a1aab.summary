by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 5 october 2013 @entity3 , badly dressed and with fragile mental health , operatic singer @entity1 was vulnerable when he stepped on to the stage at @entity7 ’s @entity6 last year			1
as he faced the judgment of @entity10 – and millions of viewers – there were fears he would endure the same fate as @entity14 , who suffered a breakdown after the pressures of the show			1
but instead , the 20st teenager overcame his demons and began to blossom			1
his depression lifted and he now credits the show with rescuing him from suicide			1
road to recovery : since finding fame , @entity1 , pictured with singing partner @entity25 , has lost 4st in weight and battled back from depression since he and singing partner @entity1 came second in the talent contest , his mental and physical health have been transformed			1
‘ @entity7 ’s @entity6 pretty much saved my life , ’ says @entity33 , 18			1
‘ before then i was suicidal and so depressed that i was self - harming			1
‘ i ’d dropped out of sixth form and my parents would n’t leave me alone at home as they thought i ’d try to take my own life			1
i felt so low it is almost impossible to describe			1
it was like i had nothing to live for – it was the darkest period of my life			1
‘ but everything changed from the moment i went on the show			1
when you ’re depressed , it ’s impossible to see a way out , but i now had a purpose			1
’ @entity33 ’s problems began when he started being bullied at school			1
‘ i ’ve been overweight for as long as i can remember and i stood out because of my size , ’ he recalls			2
‘ kids can be really horrible and they would pick on me about my weight			2
it really damaged my confidence , and while i tried not to let it show , i think that led to my depression			1
being bullied just sucks the life out of you			1
’ life - changing moment : @entity1 as they auditioned for @entity7 's @entity6 - where they eventually ended up in second place in the finals by the time @entity33 was 14 , his low self - esteem had escalated into depression			1
‘ i shut myself off from the world and lived in my own head , ’ he says			2
‘ i ’ve always felt different from everyone else and i felt cut off and excluded			2
i did n’t tell anyone how i felt – i just kept pushing it down inside me			2
’ but suppressing his distress only deepened the condition			2
in 2010 , @entity33 began self - harming			2
‘ i ’d cut the skin on my arms and stomach as i hated myself and was angry at myself for even existing			2
it was also a way of making the emotional pain a physical pain , which seemed somehow easier to deal with			2
’ things grew even worse in 2011 when he moved to a new private school to study for a-levels and was suddenly thrown into a new social mix , with a heavier workload and longer days			2
by november that year , the stress became so much that @entity33 suffered a nervous breakdown			1
‘ everything just overwhelmed me , ’ he says			2
‘ i felt more out of place than ever and was under pressure to be something different			2
‘ people there kept telling me to cut off my hair and change how i looked			2
i think that ’s what pushed me to that darkest point where i could n’t cope with anything any longer			2
‘ there were times i was so low i tried to end it			2
i never ended up in hospital but had deep cuts and my self - harming intensified			0
i was cutting myself almost every night as a form of release , almost to remind myself that i really existed			0
’ he dropped out of school and confessed his problems to his parents			0
‘ it was only then , after all those years , that i ended up spilling out all my thoughts and feelings – the first time i had openly come out as depressed , ’ admits @entity33			0
‘ my parents were amazing			0
they helped me through it and once they knew i was suicidal , they never left me home alone			0
’ they also took him to @entity116 psychiatric unit in @entity117 , @entity118 , where he began seeing a psychiatrist , who also prescribed the antidepressant @entity120			0
‘ i saw a few different psychiatrists , then found one i clicked with			0
at first i was in such a state i could n’t even form sentences as the emotions were so strong , but after a while i felt able to speak about everything			0
he got me immediately and we just talked			0
’ dynamic duo : music has put @entity33 on a healthier path and he is due to release his second album with @entity25 later this month as @entity33 was battling through the bleakest period of his life , his best friend @entity25 , 18 , asked him to audition with her for @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
the pair had been inseparable at @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity118 , since being put together to sing in music class aged 14			1
@entity25 had applied for the tv talent show before they left secondary school and had only just heard back from the producers			1
yet rather than @entity33 ’s depression proving a barrier to appearing on tv , it had the opposite effect			1
‘ by then i had given up caring about anything , so i had no reason to turn it down , ’ he says			0
‘ my parents thought i should n’t do it as i was in such a bad place but i was so low i had nothing to lose			0
’ it proved to be a life - changing decision			1
‘ from the first moment we stepped out in front of @entity10 and the crowds , it did n’t feel real			0
we were both numb with nerves , but when we started singing and the crowd started cheering it was like this warmth filled up inside me			0
’ their song – a cover of @entity169 and @entity171 ’s duet @entity172 – wowed the judges and the duo stormed through the heats to reach the @entity177 final , where they were runners - up to performing dog act @entity179 and @entity181			0
@entity33 and @entity25 soon recorded their first album , together , for @entity10 ’s label @entity184 , and it reached no 5 in the @entity7 charts			1
their second , @entity186 , for @entity188 will be released on october 14			0
but in the middle of all that , rather than shrinking under the pressure of fame and public exposure , @entity33 found himself			0
‘ when i got on the show , the more information that i let out about me , the real me , gradually it actually helped me cope with my own depression			1
for the first time i had to face it head - on and could n’t just hide away in my room as i had when i dropped out of school			0
‘ i felt overwhelmed and initially it was terrifying			0
being in front of the camera , especially as i ’ve always been self - conscious , was horrifying			0
but you do get used to it and oddly enough , it turned into a sort of therapy for me			0
‘ i have n’t had any serious episodes of depression since i ’ve been on the show			1
when i get the thoughts that once brought me to such a horrible place , i just tell myself that they do n’t matter			0
‘ i stopped therapy eight months ago as my psychiatrist and i discussed it and decided it was time to stop , though he ’s still there for support if i need him			0
i ’m still on @entity120 but will come off it eventually			0
’ @entity33 has also dropped from 20st to 16st			1
‘ i signed up with @entity219 last year , but i did n’t take it seriously until this april – now i ’ve lost 4st			1
‘ i never felt pressure to lose weight from people in the music industry but i wanted to do it for myself			0
i feel much better within myself and will keep going			0
‘ i do n’t have an ideal size in mind – i just want to be healthy			0
’ he adds : ‘ i look back now at my depression and ask myself what i was doing – there ’s no need to hurt yourself or feel so sad			1
‘ things really can get better			0
my story is proof of that			0
