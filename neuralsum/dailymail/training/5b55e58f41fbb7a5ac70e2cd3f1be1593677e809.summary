when @entity3 , a grocer , died suddenly in 1932 , his grief - stricken widow and sons decided to leave their house exactly as he knew it			1
decorated in 1923 , the redbrick @entity7 semi then remained just as it was until the last @entity3 to live there , mr @entity3 's son @entity10 junior , died and bequeathed it to the @entity12 in 1991			1
the rooms are painted in the dark colours fashionable at the time , gilt - framed oil paintings hang from picture rails , and the larder is full of @entity19 and tinned sardines			0
there are no expensive treasures or rare antiques ; instead the house , known as mr @entity3 's @entity53 , offers an authentic glimpse into how an ordinary @entity56 family lived a century ago			1
built in 1905 , it was the home of the @entity58 , a grocer family headed by @entity3 senior and his wife , @entity61			1
the couple , who had two sons , @entity10 and @entity64 , decorated it in 1923 in the style of the day , with dark and heavy wallpaper , patterned carpets , dark wooden furniture and thick curtains to keep out the cold			0
@entity3 senior ran a thriving grocery and seed business , and his younger son @entity64 joined him in the business while @entity10 junior left to teach in @entity78 where he made a considerable fortune by investing in @entity81 shares			1
a well - to - do local family , they lived a quiet , respectable and well - ordered life until 1932 when mr @entity3 senior died suddenly at the age of 68			1
in their grief , the family decided nothing would be changed			2
roll - top baths first time around : a pumice , bar of @entity96 soap and scrubbing brush lie in the wooden bath rack , near the ornate sink how we lived 90 years ago : the dining room has dark painted walls , gilt - framed oil paintings hanging from a picture rail , and working fireplace no modern appliances here : the kitchen at 7 @entity109 has a working fire , butler 's sink and wooden larder , while the kettle and the iron heat up on the stove today 's ultra-modern kitchen needs a vast range - in the 1920s , a small stove was sufficient to feed the whole family a 1932 calendar still hangs in the dining room			0
his pipe and tobacco pouch still hang beside the fireplace , and in the hall , his hats and coats remain on their pegs			0
in 1938 , @entity3 junior came back to live at @entity109 , and the following year his mother died			0
after that , the two brothers lived there until 1985 , though no modern touches were ever added			0
their mother 's bedroom was left untouched from her death in 1939 , and no television set , radio , gramophone or telephone was ever allowed over the threshold			0
the house of a family who lived comfortably : the @entity58 were a well - to - do family of grocers and seed merchants who lived at @entity109 for decades a bedroom from yesteryear : after mr @entity3 senior 's death , the piano was moved into mrs @entity58 's pretty bedroom , where it remained a happy couple , remembered forever : mr and mrs @entity58 lived at the @entity7 house until mr @entity3 died in 1932 and his wife seven years later untouched for decades : mr @entity3 's flat caps and felt trilbies are hung above rows of identical raincoats in the hall of the solidly - constructed @entity168 semi the brothers lived there harmoniously and peacefully ; @entity10 ran the house and his brother cycled into @entity7 every day to open up the shop			1
they followed a rigid routine for 40 years , parsimonious with their money , never throwing anything away , and hoarding an eclectic mix of possessions which now give a fascinating insight to their lives			0
@entity3 lived at the house until 1985 and died in 1990 , while his brother died some years before			2
with no heir , he bequeathed the house to the @entity12 , which decided to leave it exactly as it was			2
@entity187 , house and visitor manager , said : ' it offers the public a unique insight into family life between the wars			1
' preserved for decades : the @entity3 brothers hoarded everything and stored it meticulously away in the red - brick suburban house from an age when things were made to last : beautifully polished , although missing one of the original laces , mr @entity3 's black leather shoes are still pristine the wooden cupboard in the kitchen suffers from woodworm but still bears groceries bought decades ago , while the old - fashioned scales have n't weighed anything for decades old letters with painstakingly - typed addresses lie in a metal letter tray - they look to have been opened by a letter - opener			2

the suburban *semi-detached* house at @entity216 , @entity7 , was the home of the @entity3 family , who were grocers
after @entity3 senior died suddenly in 1932 , his grief - stricken family decided to leave the house as it was
now owned by the @entity12 , it offers a unique glimpse into family life in suburban @entity26 between the wars
