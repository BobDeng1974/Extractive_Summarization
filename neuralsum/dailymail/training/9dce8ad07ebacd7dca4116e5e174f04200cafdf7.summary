the controversial move means that customers will now only be able dip their bread or garnish their food using oil from non-refillable and labelled bottles			2
a decision to ban the classic jugs and dipping bowls was made by a little - known @entity21 committee earlier this week			1
outlawed : from january 2014 restaurants will have to serve oil from pre-packaged factory bottles with tamper - proof nozzles and labelling in line with @entity5 industrial standards they will be outlawed across @entity30 from the start of next year , with restaurants ordered to use oil from pre-packaged factory bottles complete with tamperproof lids			1
but restaurateurs have criticised the authoritarian measure taken by the @entity38 – the @entity5 ’s executive			2
the body said it no plans to impose similar restrictions on packaging for butter , salt , pepper and other dinner table essentials			0
the @entity38 said that a majority of the @entity5 ’s member states had backed the move , which has already been compulsory in @entity52 since 2006 , and will benefit producers in struggling nations such as @entity55 and @entity56			2
traditional : prince @entity57 trying unmarked olive oil from a dipping bowl , a practice which will soon be banned the move was justified to improve hygiene and improve the ‘ image of olive oil ’ , with the @entity5 suggesting that many customers are often tricked by cheaper alternatives to olive oil			1
@entity5 spokesman @entity68 said : ‘ we are just protecting consumers			0
we are just making clear that when you want to have olive oil of a certain quality in a restaurant you get exactly the one you are paying for			1

the move to ban the jugs and serving dishes will be enforced by local authority food inspections of restaurants in the @entity104			2

’ speaking to @entity127 , mep @entity126 said : ‘ is it april 1st ? with the euro crisis , a collapse in confidence in the @entity5 , and a faltering economy surely the commission has more important things to worry about than banning refillable olive oil bottles ? ‘ they should be seeking to reduce unnecessary packaging			1
