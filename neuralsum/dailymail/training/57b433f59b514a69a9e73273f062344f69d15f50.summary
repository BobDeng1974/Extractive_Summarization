@entity0 has been accused of racism after allegedly linking names usually associated with black people to adverts related to criminality			1
a @entity7 professor found ' significant discrimination ' after comparing the adverts which appear when searching a typically black name compared with those for typically white names			1
findings showed that names typically associated with black people were 25 per cent more likely to bring up adverts related to criminality			1
racist ? a new study claims that adverts linked to @entity0 search results for typically black @entity21 names are more likely to be suggestive of criminality - like services offering to check arrest and criminal records the study by @entity26 contrasted online searches using names such as ' @entity29 ' and ' @entity30 , ' with those such as ' @entity31 ' and ' @entity32			1
' she found that adverts posted alongside search results for names likely to belong to black people were more likely to offer services like background checks for arrests and criminal records			1
searches using white - sounding names were less likely to result in advert results which suggested criminality , professor @entity43 's research indicated			1
the findings are significant since @entity0 searching the names of potential employees , clients or even friends and dates has become commonplace			1
' advantages of knowing such information when hiring or engaging with a person relate to trustworthiness , ' professor @entity43 writes in a paper published online in the journal @entity60			2
consequences : the findings are significant since @entity0 searching the names of potential employees , clients or even friends and dates has become commonplace ( file photo ) professor @entity43 gathered evidence by collecting more than 2,000 names which were suggestive of race			1
she then entered these names plus surnames into @entity0 and news agency @entity73 ' @entity0 - powered search engine and looked at which adverts the search results returned			2
while most names brought back adverts for public records , typically black names were much more likely to bring back those that included the word ' arrest '			1
all the results came from background - checking service instantcheckmate.com			2
in one particular case highlighted by @entity43 , a search for the black - sounding names @entity89 , @entity26 and @entity90 all brought up adverts for arrest checking services			1
however , subsequent investigation showed only one of the names , @entity90 , had an arrest record linked to it			1
sample ad and criminal reports for ' latanya farrell ' ( a , b ) , ' latanya sweeney ' ( c , d ) , and ' latanya locket ' ( e , f ) appearing on google.com and reuters.com typically white names : sample ads and criminal reports for ' kristen haring ' ( a ) , ' kristen sparrow ' ( b ) , and ' kristen lindquist ' ( c )			1
criminal reports from @entity109 ( b , d , f ) brain scans could soon be used to detect whether or not people are racist , scientists say			0
researchers found that brain scans were able to pick up on differences in the way that people with implicit negative racial attitudes viewed black and white faces			2
racial stereotypes have previously been shown to have subtle and unintended consequences on how we treat members of different race groups			0
but the new research published in @entity129 , a journal of the @entity131 , shows race biases also increase differences in the brain 's representations of faces			0
psychologists from the @entity138 in @entity139 and @entity140 examined activity in the brain while participants looked at pictures of @entity146 and black faces			0
afterwards , participants performed a task that assessed their unconscious or implicit expression of race attitudes			0
by examining patterns of brain activity in the fusiform face area — which is involved in face perception — researchers were able to predict the race of the person the participant was viewing , but only for those with strong , negative implicit race attitudes			0
this , the researchers said , implies that people with stronger , negative implicit race attitudes may actually perceive black and white faces to look more different than others who held no such prejudice			2
' in comparison , searches for “ @entity169 ” , “ @entity178 ” and “ @entity179 ” did not yield any instantcheckmate.com ads , only competitor ads , even though the company ’s database reports having records for all three names and arrest records for “ @entity178 ” and “ @entity179 " , ' professor @entity43 wrote			1
she added : ' together , these hand - picked examples describe the suspected pattern – ads suggesting arrest tend to appear with names associated with blacks and neutral ads or no ads tend to appear with names associated with whites , regardless of whether the company has an arrest record associated with the name			1
' in the @entity194 , black people are 3.3 times more likely than white people to be arrested for a crime and those from the mixed ethnic group 2.3 times more likely			2
the findings raise ' questions as to whether @entity0 's advertising technology exposes racial bias in society and how ad and search technology can develop to assure racial fairness , ' professor @entity43 said in a blog post			2
advertisers bid on terms , or key words , with high bidders getting their ads posted alongside corresponding search results			0
@entity0 defends the process as race - neutral , saying outcomes are driven by decisions by advertisers			0
a spokesman said : ' @entity220 does not conduct any racial profiling			0
' we also have an “ anti ” and violence policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organisation , person or group of people			0
' it is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads. ' instant @entity236 contacted @entity237 in response the the issues raised in the study			0
a spokesman said : ' as a point of fact , @entity242 would like to state unequivocally that it has never engaged in racial profiling in @entity220			0
' we have absolutely no technology in place to even connect a name with a race and have never made any attempt to do so			0
' the very idea is contrary to our company 's most deeply held principles and values			0
' the study was funded in part by the @entity257 and a grant from @entity0 .			0
