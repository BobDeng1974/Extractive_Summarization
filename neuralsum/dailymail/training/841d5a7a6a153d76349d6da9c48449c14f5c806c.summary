a fox has become the latest victims to the freezing temperatures on @entity4 's waters as it was found frozen solid in a lake in southern @entity6			1
the animal was discovered by a skater on @entity9 , near @entity10 , who originally thought it was a piece of foam rubber , but found the poor fox dead in the ice with its head just above the surface			2
it follows recent ' animal ice deaths ' in @entity4 , where an entire shoal of fish were photographed off the coast of @entity23 just days after a moose had suffered the same fate			1
not saying much now : the fox was found frozen solid in the ice on a lake in southern @entity6 @entity29 , 26 , said : ‘ from what i could see the ice had obviously cracked and the fox had fallen through the hole			1
unable to get out after scrabbling around it must have tried to swim under the ice in a last - ditch effort to save itself and then probably suffocated			2
’ he said : ‘ i 'd been unsure myself as to whether skating on a lake here in @entity10 was a good idea			0
‘ temperatures had been below zero for several days though , so in the end i figured it was strong enough for a skate			0
i guessed the ice was likely between three and five centimetres thick			0
’ ‘ i skated fairly close by and saw it out of the corner of my eye and thought someone had thrown foam rubber of something into the water , and then i saw it was a fox , ' @entity29 told @entity53			0
' it was totally frozen , the whiskers were sticking up above the surface			0
' well and truly iced : it is likely that the fox fell through thin ice and unable to get back out , froze to death as temperatures sunk overnight on thin ice : skater @entity29 decided to return home after he saw that the fox had gone through the frozen surface cold shoulder : when mr @entity65 found the fox on @entity9 , near @entity10 , he originally thought it was a piece of foam rubber he added : ‘ i 'd never seen anything like it before			1
i must admit i felt really sorry for the fox , but not for long , because i felt if it can happen to the fox , i might be next			0
’ ‘ i just thought “ whoops , it 's time to go home ”			0
’ the is is not the first time animals have been caught out by freezing temperatures in @entity4 waters			0
last week an entire shoal of fish was found frozen mid-swim off the coast of @entity23 , near the northern island of @entity81			1
earlier in the winter , a moose was found frozen solid after falling through the icy surface of a @entity23 lake , found half visible above the ice			1
it appears as though it was trying to cross the ice , when it cracked , trapping the moose in the freezing water			2
cold sushi : an entire shoal of fish was found frozen mid-swim off the coast of @entity23 , near the northern island of @entity81 frozen : the animal was found frozen solid in the middle of the water near @entity98 in northern @entity23 with just its antlers and back visible above the ice			1

@entity102 found frozen solid on ice - covered lake in southern @entity6
may have fallen through thin ice and unable to get out of the water
a shoal of fish and a moose have also been discovered frozen solid
