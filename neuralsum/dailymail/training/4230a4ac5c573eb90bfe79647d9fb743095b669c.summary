@entity1 spin doctor @entity0 has hit back after he was caught on @entity2 in a bitter altercation with a member of the public			1
@entity2 footage shows the former press secretary to @entity8 push away a man who abused him in a back street in @entity11 , north @entity12			1
mr @entity0 has now denied claims he punched and spat at the man , who called him : ' the biggest piece of s * * * i ’ve ever seen in this street			1
the footage shows mr @entity0 ( right of picture ) enter the street after he had been jogging and a man ( left of picture ) walking towards him the man appears to say something to the controversial political figure and later revealed he told mr @entity0 he was ' the biggest piece of s * * * i ’ve ever seen in this street ' the footage came to light after the man , who has not been named , went to former @entity1 mp @entity41 to tell him about the run - in with mr @entity0			1
the 61 - year - old father - of - three involved later told local paper @entity44 that mr @entity0 ' struck out ' and ' hit me on my shoulder ' after he made the remark			1
he added : ' i turned to confront him and said " that is assault , you should be in prison "			0
' at which point spitting ensued and then i aimed a blow with my foot that did not connect			2
nothing that i did was illegal and he had no right to punch me			0
' mr @entity0 , 57 , has completely denied spitting at the man , but says ' minimal ' contact was made to stop the man coming any closer			1
the @entity2 appears to show mr @entity0 push the man away from him before they go out of shot as the argument continues			1
the man involved then comes back into shot and appears to shout something down the street before walking off			2
mr @entity0 has been a senior figure in @entity1 for many years and is currently advising @entity68 mr @entity0 says he put out an arm to keep the man away from him as they came together in the road mr @entity0 wrote on his website today : ‘ i was walking down @entity75 last monday after a run in @entity11 when a man walking towards me began shouting in abusive and aggressive terms as he approached			1
' as i passed him i did not look at him , did not respond to his insults and put my arm out to his shoulder to stop him coming any closer			0
if there was any contact at all it was minimal			2
' i walked on a few steps , thought he was doing the same but he turned back , followed me , continued to abuse me and when i turned around he came towards me and aimed a kick at me which came into brief contact with my leg			2
' he then moved back but he came forward again and spat at me , most of the spit landing on my shirt , some on my face			0
i then turned and walked away			0
' he continued to shout abuse as he walked in the other direction			0
i am confident that any full @entity2 coverage of the incident would show all this to be the case			2
' the man then turns and an argument appears to ensue as he follows mr @entity0 down the road moments later , after mr @entity0 says he was kicked and spat at , the man re-appears and walks off mr @entity0 says the response to the incident was stirred up by former @entity1 mp @entity41 , who tweeted this message after the man spoke to him mr @entity0 added : ' the claim he subsequently made to @entity41 and to which @entity111 drew attention on social media – suggesting that i punched and spat at him – is totally untrue , indeed close to being the opposite of the truth			1
' the fact that he went to @entity111 rather than the police , does not wish to be identified , and wishes to have his claims made anonymously through @entity111 ’s office , speaks volumes			0
' i have kept the shirt unwashed should this go any further , though given the police have better things to do with their time , i have no interest in pressing charges			0
' he has called on @entity130 council to release any cctv which may show the whole incident			0
mr @entity0 , who lives near where the incident happened , gained a reputation for having a hot temper while working with the @entity1 government			1
his management style is said to be the inspiration for @entity138 , the foul - mouthed fictional spin doctor in @entity139 and the film in @entity141 .			0
