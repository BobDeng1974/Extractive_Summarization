@entity0 may have been derided for using a $ 15 flip phone at the @entity2 earlier this year - but it appears she may have simply been ahead of the curve of @entity6 fashion			1
new figures reveal @entity6 shipments of traditional flip - phones rose in 2014 for the first time in seven years while smartphone shipments fell			1
experts say the figures highlight @entity6 consumers ' tenacious attachment to the familiar and typically less expensive older models			2
the handsets have been dubbed ' @entity18 ' phones because they have evolved to meet unique @entity6 standards and tastes dubbed ' @entity18 ' phones because they have evolved to meet unique @entity6 standards and tastes , flip - phone shipments rose 5.7 percent to 10.58 million in 2014 , data from market researcher @entity22 shows			1
smartphone shipments fell 5.3 percent to 27.70 million , down for a second year			0
users in @entity6 pay some of the highest smartphone fees among developed nations , the telecommunications ministry says , while flip - phone rates are among the lowest			1
many @entity6 accustomed to years of deflation are content with old - style flip - phones offering voice calling , email and in most cases basic internet services			1
@entity6 electronics companies @entity38 and @entity40 have pulled out of the consumer smartphone business , unable to compete with dominant brands @entity42 and @entity44 they still make flip - phones , though , competing in a crowded market with @entity48 and @entity49 , among others			1
but with a mobile penetration rate of 98.5 percent , or 125 million subscriptions , there is little scope for significant overall growth in @entity6 's mobile market , @entity22 said			2
' smartphones are also peaking in terms of functionality and they tend to last a long time as well , so there are fewer renewals , ' said @entity22 executive analyst @entity62			0
he said 2014 was a particularly strong year for renewals in the subscription cycle for flip - phones , suggesting that last year 's growth may not be repeated this year			1
however , its not just in @entity6 the flip phone is back			1
in between cheering on players at the @entity2 in @entity70 earlier this year , @entity68 editor - in - chief @entity0 was pictured glancing at her cell phone - a rather dated looking flip phone			1
the 64 - year - old fashion maven was seen peering out from her signature dark sunglasses to look more closely at the tiny screen on the phone , which appears to be a $ 15 pay - as - you go phone from @entity80			1
old - fashioned : in between cheering on players at the @entity2 on thursday , @entity68 editor - in - chief @entity0 was pictured glancing at her cell phone - a rather dated looking flip phone the model , an @entity86 , has a small two - inch display screen and offers texting and calling but no apps			1
her decision to use such a simple and inexpensive is something of a surprise considering ms @entity0 presumably has the most cutting - edge products at her fingertips			2
perhaps the editor , who is known to be a creature of habit , simply likes to stick with what she knows best			0
indeed , back in 2004 she was seen using a similar flip phone while watching a @entity100 runway show , although that particular model looked even more retro with an antenna			1
by 2007 , she graduated to a somewhat sleeker model - the @entity104 , which she brandished proudly at yet another fashion show			0
from 2009 to 2012 , ms @entity0 was pictured multiple times using a @entity107 , and it seemed she had finally found a modern phone she liked			1
and just last year , she was seen carrying around both a @entity107 and an @entity110 , a symbol of her busy business life			0
though it may be easy to mock ms @entity0 's low - tech choice of phone , she may actually be on the money			2
a recent trend observed by @entity118 has seen classic 1990s models by @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 commanding four - figure sums on @entity124 and other resale sites			0
while they may lack features , these retro phones are simple to use , have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible compared to their smartphone equivalents			0
' some people do n't blink at the prices , we have models at more than € 1,000 ( £ 810 or $ 1,360 ) , ' said @entity135 , who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009			0
' the high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models , which were limited editions in their time			0
' @entity142 online shop @entity140 , which sells a range of vintage , revamped mobile phones , claims simplicity is the way forward			0
' too many online social networks and an excess of email and applications , have made us slaves to technology in our everyday life , ' it said on its website			0
' we have two types of profiles : the 25 to 35 year - olds attracted by the retro and offbeat side of a telephone that is a little different , and those who are nostalgic for the phone that they used when they were younger , ' said @entity167 , who founded @entity140 in 2010			2
' some use it to complement their smartphone , but others are going for the vintage , tired of the technology race between the phone makers			0
' here are some of the retro phones making a comeback : @entity178 130 : a model launched in 1998 - and repainted bright orange was recently offered for € 180 ( £ 145 or $ 245 )			2
ironically , the trend is just starting as the telecommunications industry throws such handsets into the recycling bins , hailing smartphones as the way ahead			0
@entity178 130 , $ 245 @entity120 8210 : has a tiny monochrome screen and plastic buttons , at € 59.99 ( £ 48 or $ 80 )			0
@entity189 firm @entity120 , the biggest mobile phone company before the advent of @entity42 's @entity110 or @entity44 's @entity191 , offloaded its handset division to @entity193 this year after failing to catch the smartphone wave @entity195 , $ 80 @entity120 : currently listed for € 1,000 ( £ 810 or $ 1,360 ) , while a @entity196 could be purchased for € 250 ( £ 200 or $ 337 )			2

the handsets have been dubbed ' @entity18 ' phones in @entity6
