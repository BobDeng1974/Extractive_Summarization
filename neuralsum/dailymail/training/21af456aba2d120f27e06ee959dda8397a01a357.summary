in an expletive - filled tirade about - of all things - grammar , @entity0 told the president to ' be f * * * * * g presidential			1
' the @entity10 legend , who publicly backed @entity1 in 2008 and 2012 , questioned why the @entity12 - educated former law professor chooses to drop the letter ' g ' from the end of his words			1
in an astonishing rant , @entity0 , 64 , said that the president was trying too hard to ' relate ' to normal people instead of being true to who he really is			1
@entity0 's attack has been described by some as ' ironic ' after the @entity38 star agreed to appear in a video called ' wake the f * * k up			1
vote for @entity1 ' during the last election			2
speaking in an interview with @entity28 , the actor questioned the president 's reasons for changing his speech , saying : ' first of all , we know it ai n’t because of his blackness , so i say stop trying to " relate			1
" ' be a leader			0
be f * * * * * * g presidential			0
look , i grew up in a society where i could say “ it ai n’t ” or “ what it be ” to my friends			0
' but when i ’m out presenting myself to the world as me , who graduated from college , who had family who cared about me , who has a well - read background , i f * * * * * g conjugate '			2
@entity0 , himself a university graduate , having studied acting at @entity66 , @entity67 , said he gets annoyed when high profile figures try to talk in ' street language ' to appear more down - to - @entity71			1
he continued his rant by saying educated men like the president who actively try to speak less correctly encourage mediocrity			1
he said : ' the other day i ’m watching this white guy talking to black people on tv , and all of a sudden he ’s saying stuff like “ pump your brakes ” and “ i got you , ” these new politically cool terms that kind of came out of hip - hop and blackness			0
' i ’m thinking , we do still speak @entity86 , right ? though sometimes i wonder			0
so yeah , it still happens			0
but the whole language and culture are different now			0
' i ’ll be reading scripts and the screenwriter mistakes “ your ” for “ you ’re			0
” on @entity95 someone will write , “ your an idiot , ” and i ’ll go , “ no , you ’re an idiot , ” and all my @entity96 will go , “ hey , @entity0 , he ’s the grammar police			2
” ' i ’ll take that			0
i mean , we have newscasters who do n’t even know how to conjugate verbs ... how the f * * * did we become a society where mediocrity is acceptable ? ' @entity0 's assault on the president 's choice of language seems rich given that he has become one of the most well known proponents of profanity in movies			1
his foul mouthed @entity1 reelection video was based on a book which had previously narrated called ' go the f * * * to sleep , ' by @entity120			2
@entity0 also famously owns a lightsaber , which he kept after starring in the @entity123 films , with the initials ' @entity124 ' inscribed onto the handle			2
