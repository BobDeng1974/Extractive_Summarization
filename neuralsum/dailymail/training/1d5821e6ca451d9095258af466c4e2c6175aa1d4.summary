by @entity0 published : 14:48 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 15:32 est , 9 march 2012 a decanter box that belonged to the @entity2 and may have been used during the @entity3 has been uncovered on the @entity5 's @entity4			1
the old mahogany box was bought by @entity7 at an auction in the late 19th century but remained locked for 75 years because he did not have a key for it			0
it was not until his grandson , @entity12 , inherited the box that the lock was prised open with a screwdriver and a cheque signed by @entity2 found inside , along with 10 glass wine and brandy decanters			1
piece of history : @entity21 shows the decanter box owned by the @entity2 to a delighted @entity23 on the @entity4 valuable item : the cheque signed by @entity2 is worth the equivalent of £ 100,000 today and could have been used to buy the silence of a mistress mr @entity7 's daughter , @entity21 , showed the box to antiques specialist @entity23 at an event for the tv show in @entity32 , @entity33			1
mr @entity23 speculated that the £ 195 - equivalent to £ 100,000 today - may have been intended to buy the silence of one of @entity2 ’s mistresses			1
' he had a number of mistresses over the years , including one called @entity39 who threatened to write her memoirs and he said " publish and damned " , said mr @entity23			0
he added : ' is this £ 100,000 to pay off someone like @entity39 ? ' the @entity44 cheque was dated march 1823 - eight years after the @entity2 defeated @entity45 at @entity3			1
experts believe the discovery of the cheque is evidence the box once belonged to the @entity52 war hero			1
fascinating : intrigued specialists believe the box of beautiful decanters could have been in the duke 's camp at @entity3 years ago banks used to send cheques back to their owners once they had been processed			1
@entity2 was the first @entity2 and one of the leading military and political figures of the 19th century			1
he is often referred to as ' the @entity2 ' though there have been several since			1
heroic @entity2 took part in 60 battles during his military career , including commanding the allied army that defeated @entity45 at the @entity3			1
he was twice prime minister under the @entity69 party and oversaw the passage of the @entity71			0
he was one of the leading figures in the @entity73 until his retirement and remained commander - in - chief of the @entity76 until his death			0
mr @entity23 added : ' there is another thing that happened in 1823 - his son bought a commission in the army			0
' was it to buy his son ’s commission ? it ’s still an awful lot of money			0
' it has been described as a ' campaign decanter set ' and specialists believe it may well have been in @entity2 ’s private camp at @entity3 in @entity93			2
mr @entity23 added : ' it is a campaign decanter case so did the @entity2 take it on his campaign ? in which case , was it at @entity3 ? ' mrs @entity21 , 42 , from @entity97 , said her great - grandfather bought the set at a @entity101 auctioneers in the late 19th century			2
he bequeathed it to his son @entity103 , a lawyer , who in turn left it to his schoolteacher son @entity106 ’s late father			0
she said : ' the set had been locked ever since my great - grandfather bought it and it was just used as a piece of furniture by my family			0
' then in about 1965 my father became very curious about what was inside this box			2
' he tried several keys and it would n’t open and against all his best principles he used a screwdriver to ease the lock			0
' there was small amount of damage to the wood and lock			0
' he found the bottles and then this piece of paper fell to the floor and he picked it up and saw it was the @entity2 cheque			1
' since then we have always called it the @entity2 chest and we like the romance and the " what ifs " about it			2
' we do n’t believe it would be right to sell it			0
' priceless : the box was bought at auction by mrs @entity21 's great - grandfather and she said her family like the ' romance ' of it bested : @entity45 had superior numbers the return of @entity45 from exile induced allied leaders to prepare to attack @entity149			2
@entity2 , with an army based in @entity151 , was in contact with the @entity154 commander @entity153 to his east , but @entity45 seized an early advantage , beating the @entity157 at @entity158 on june 16			2
although @entity2 held off the @entity149 at @entity159 the same day , he had to fall back to the low ridge of @entity161 , south of @entity151			2
@entity153 agreed to join him on the ridge , and @entity45 's subordinate @entity163 failed to block his advance			0
on june 18 , @entity45 , with 72,000 men , waited for the ground to firm up and attacked late			0
though there were moments when the @entity149 came close to winning - @entity2 's 68,000 men , many sheltered from fire by the ridge , were still holding on when the @entity157 arrived			1
while @entity2 could never have won without ' the best of all instruments , @entity52 infantry ' , @entity172 and @entity173 troops made a vital contribution , and his plan depended on @entity153 keeping his word			1
@entity3 was decisive , ending the @entity45 restoration .			0

box was eventually prised open by owner 's grandson
cheque for £ 195 signed by @entity2 also found inside
