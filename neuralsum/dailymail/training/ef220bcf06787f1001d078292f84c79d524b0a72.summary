by @entity0 for @entity1 she travels the world with her entourage , is loved by millions and is so recognisable that she 's regularly stopped in the street : welcome to the world of @entity6 , the most famous feline on the planet			1
but while her famously cross looks might have made her name , her increasingly lucrative brand is all down to her agent , cat specialist @entity12 , 35			1
currently in @entity13 where tv movie @entity6 's @entity15 is being filmed , lashes is bubbling over with plans for the future , starting with a @entity20 documentary starring the sad - faced feline that airs tonight			1
man with a plan : @entity12 is the manager behind the internet phenomenon that is @entity6 but while the documentary has wrapped , the film has not and @entity14 declares that he is thrilled with the way it 's turning out			1
' it 's crazy , ' he drawls gleefully down the phone from @entity31			2
' last night , we had race car that we crashed into a @entity36 village and thanks to @entity39 magic , @entity32 is in the car			1
' grumpy , real name @entity6 , was actually nowhere near the crashed car but that does n't matter to her legions of fans who range in age from nine months to 90			2
such inter-generational appeal means big bucks for lashes and @entity32 's owners , siblings @entity51 and @entity53 , and a family - friendly brand of the sort to make advertisers salivate			2
unsurprisingly , @entity32 has gone on to star in numerous ad campaigns , among them @entity61 cat food brand @entity59 , as well as appearing on official merchandise that ranges from hoodies to ' @entity65 ' coffee			0
superstar : @entity6 , real name @entity6 , has feline dwarfism and a permanently sad face as a result in demand : grumpy cat and her owner @entity73 appear at the @entity75 but she 's not the only the only client of lashes - real name @entity78 - to be doing well from internet stardom			1
also on his books are @entity82 , a cartoon feline with the body of a pop tart , and @entity86 , which shot to posthumous fame thanks to a video which showed it playing the piano			1
human clients include @entity91 , the shifty looking star of a rap album cover that went viral , and @entity95 aka @entity94 , a @entity96 runner who shot to fame after a snap of him finishing a marathon proved popular online			1
this , he says , is a route to becoming a star that is becoming ever more routine and , he adds , is n't just for cats and runners			2
' look at [ @entity108 ] @entity107 , ' he explains			0
' we know his name because he got famous on @entity111 , as did @entity112 and @entity113			0
' on @entity111 you see actors , actresses and musians finding their audience through an online video			0
it probably wo n't take over completely from the traditional route but it makes it easier for talent to rise to the top			2
' grumpy cat is a good example of how online fame can translate into big business but @entity12 says he has no plans to take on any other cats - unless , of course , they have @entity32 's ' star quality '			1
' i do n't go after every cat that comes out and i have n't picked up a new cat since @entity32 and perhaps i never will , ' he confesses			0
' my business is more than just cats but cats happen to run the internet			0
it feels like a special moment where cats are overtaking the rest of the entertainment industry			0
' and that could n't be more true in @entity32 's case			0
' it 's been a bit of a whirlwind career , ' admits @entity12 , who is estimated to have made a ' low six - figure sum ' from his involvement with the cat so far			1
' she has two books , a movie , she 's the spokescat for @entity59 , she has merchandise , although grumpy herself has been really relaxed through it all			1
' fame : @entity86 , real name @entity86 , achieved posthumous fame after this 1984 video went viral in 2007 not so grumpy : @entity32 's @entity164 made the most of her mulish looks but she is actually very friendly so what makes the perfect @entity39 cat other than a docile temperament			1
according to lashes , it 's all about a @entity174 magic			2
' i 've never been someone who 's called up every mildly famous cat on the internet , ' he insists			0
' i 'm very picky			0
to be worth it , they have to already be an icon			0
' when i first saw @entity6 , she was instantly , to me , something you could never forget			2
so i think that the ones i care about and the ones that have the potential to have a brand are the special ones			0
' not every cat can do it and become a celebrity just like not every human can become a celebrity			0
a certain amount of it is magic - the thing that makes the @entity197 more than four guys playing in a basement			2
' all the icons have that - there 's a bit of that cosmic aura about them			1
that 's the kind of thing @entity6 has and she brings smiles to everyone			1
' and @entity12 is n't exaggerating			2
book signings attract huge crowds while appearances on shows such as @entity214 send ratings soaring			0
no wonder lashes is pleased			0
so what 's next for the world 's most famous cat ? lashes is n't telling			0
' i 'm planning to have this movie finished up in the next few weeks , we 'll take a break in the fall and then unveil it to the world in late november as a @entity228 gift for all of @entity6 's fans			1
' for next year , people are going to just have stay tuned			0
' @entity12 and @entity6 appear on @entity232 : the rise of superstar pets , tonight at 9pm on @entity20			1

@entity12 is a @entity39 agent who has @entity6 on his books
other clients include @entity239 , @entity86 and @entity91
says the key quality needed for *greatness* is a bit of @entity245 - style magic
thinks going viral will become an increasingly common route to fame
currently filming @entity6 's @entity228 , a tv movie
