@entity18 is investigating claims that the @entity1 @entity10 , in the @entity26 area of the city ( pictured ) , has used public money to fund a hi - tech school 5,000 miles away in @entity6 it is the latest controversy to hit the school , which caters for 800 children aged between four and 16			1
in may , it was placed in special measures after being branded ' inadequate ' in a damning @entity35 report , and a month later the whole governing body was sacked over financial troubles , including a £ 900,000 budget deficit			1
it now faces allegations that the trust used public money to build the boys - only school in @entity17 , situated just 240 miles from the @entity45 border , which opened in 2004 and is said to be prospering			1
the trust 's website boasts that the school provides children with an environment in which they can ' develop their @entity1 principles '			1
in a seven - minute video on the website , the school also appeals to the public for charitable donations for the @entity6 school			1
the clip begins by showing the communities of @entity61 , the largest of @entity6 's four provinces , and claiming that it is ' one of the poorest regions in the world			1
' the slick video then show the students wearing blue blazers and ties , working at wooden desks piled high with books and standing in regimented lines on the school 's drill square with mountains in the background			2

the narrator says that the school can only continue to give all students free board and lodging as well as an education through charitable donations			2
he says : ' @entity97 @entity96 is a well - established charitable organisation run by the @entity100 community in the @entity96			2
' the trust is a pioneering institution focusing on establishing an educational system which delivers high academic standards within an @entity1 environment			2
' the existence of this institution is a token of love , help and solidarity from the @entity6 and wider @entity100 community in the @entity96 for the needy students of @entity61			2
' all the educational needs of the students are addressed by @entity97 through donations and generosity of kind - hearted people like you			2
' however , in @entity121 , the school in the @entity26 area of @entity11 , is apparently in a state of disrepair and desperately needs refurbishing			1
a school insider said : ' the school in @entity11 is falling apart , its roof is leaking and there is little space for outdoor play			1
' yet the trust has used £ 1million to build a new school in @entity6			1
' the @entity136 sister school in @entity6 is situated in front of a backdrop of mountains and was set up in 2004 the @entity11 school , which opened in 1988 , became voluntary aided in 2002 and , therefore , secured funding from the city council			1
the council has confirmed a probe into the school 's finances , including the allegations public cash was used to help fund the school in @entity6 , is now underway			1
a spokesman said : ' we were concerned about the severe deficit the school has got itself into and where that money might be going			1
' we put a board in place in the school with access to financial records and we carried out a retrospective investigation			2
' we have gathered enough information to warrant further investigation into the use of public funds and we continue to work with the relevant statutory agencies			1
' if we find anything criminal it will be referred to the police			0
' the majority of the school 's students are of @entity6 origin , and the senior school receives over 1,000 applications for 60 places a year , making it one of the most over-subscribed schools in the @entity96			1
the @entity175 said it was liaising with the authorities while the investigation takes place			0
a spokesman said : ' we are aware of these serious allegations which are being investigated by @entity18			0
' we are liaising closely with them and continue to monitor the situation			0
' the school is currently in special measures and we have approved the council 's choice of interim executive board			1
' a number of teachers from the nearby @entity190 in the @entity192 area of @entity11 have been drafted in to @entity10 in recent weeks as part of a ' buddying ' scheme to try to ' share best practice '			1
however , sources claim the school is still riddled with problems , including continuing to segregate boys and girls			0
one person , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ' even the staff have separate meeting rooms for male and female teachers			0
' @entity205 ( pictured ) , the former chairman of governors at @entity10 in @entity11 , has been issued with a @entity208 writ amid claims of harassment , intimidation and trespassing on the school site parents waiting for their children outside the school today condemned the idea of £ 1million being sent to fund the @entity6 facility			1
father - of - three @entity219 , 29 , said : ' i would not be happy if i found out funds meant for this school were being spent elsewhere			2
' if they are given money to spend at this school , it should stay in this school			0
' they could spend the money on a new building because this one is not good enough			0
' if you go into @entity11 you can see other schools and they are more modern and much better			2
' so if they are given money they have to use it here			0
' if i gave you money to improve your life and you gave it away that would be wrong , and it is the same here			0
' father - of - two @entity244 , 40 , has already taken one of his sons out of the school			2
he said : ' i moved my elder son to a different school this september , but that was just because he was struggling			0
' i can not see how they would get away with just giving this school 's money to the one in @entity6			1
' if they have been taking the money then that is totally wrong because this school could definitely do with it			0
' in july , @entity18 was forced to take out an injunction banning former chairman of governors @entity205 from the school			0
mr @entity205 was accused of leading a harassment campaign against the new interim board , but he denied those claims			2
he has been issued with a @entity208 writ warning him that he faces a damages bill of up to £ 100,000 due to his conduct			0
the writ accuses him of harassment , intimidation and trespassing on the school site after he was sacked from his post			0
the @entity275 has contacted us to make the following points : ‘ the claims that the @entity97 diverted £ 1 million designated for a school in the @entity96 to build a school in @entity6 are entirely false			1
in 1997 the @entity281 purchased the site of the @entity284 schools in @entity11			2
since gaining @entity287 status in 2002 the @entity284 school has been a separate legal entity to the @entity97 and has been operating as such for over 12 years			0
as a voluntary aided school , @entity18 has been responsible for managing the financial affairs of the school from commissioning annual official audits to ensuring compliance with financial standards			0
this removes any possibility of the @entity97 or governing body using the school 's funding for any other project whether in @entity6 or the @entity96			1
the @entity281 , a separate entity is a registered charity that runs many independent projects both in the @entity96 and abroad to advance the provision of education in some of the poorest communities			0
the school in @entity17 , @entity6 , which was subject to yesterday 's unfounded assertions is one such charitable project			1
acquisition of the land and the costs of construction for this school were funded by the @entity313 with whom the @entity97 was working in partnership			0
’ probe : police at @entity10 earlier this year the disgraced former chairman of governors at @entity10 , @entity205 , was linked to the infamous @entity320 plot in @entity11			1
@entity136 , a state - funded @entity100 faith school , was not one of the 21 inspected by @entity35 in connection with the so - called @entity320 plot to oust secular heads and governors at state schools and force through strict @entity1 principles			1
however , most of the individuals who claimed to be key figures in the alleged plot had strong links to the @entity97 , the body which owns and , until may , ran the school			0
@entity335 , the plot 's alleged ringleader , was secretary to the @entity97 and head of the @entity338 , a body which , according to its website , trains @entity100 parents to ' empower the community to ensure our needs are met '			0
mr @entity205 , the sacked chairman of governors , was seconded as a ' consultant ' to @entity348 at the same time as its respected @entity350 headteacher , @entity349 , was removed			0
however , mr @entity205 denies any involvement in mr @entity349 's departure			0
in june , the school 's entire governing body was sacked over financial troubles , including a £ 900,000 budget deficit			1
it came a month after the school was placed in special measures after being branded ' inadequate ' in a damning @entity35 report			0
inspectors found the school had an unbalanced curriculum and said governors were ' too heavily involved in the day - to - day running '			2
in the wake of the report , @entity18 disbanded the governors and appointed a new head and ' interim executive board ' to run the school			0
it prompted protests from over 100 parents who expressed their anger at the entire governing body being sacked			0
at the same time , @entity18 was also forced to take out an injunction banning mr @entity205 from the school			0
mr @entity205 was accused of leading the harassment campaign against the new interim board , but he denied those claims			2
