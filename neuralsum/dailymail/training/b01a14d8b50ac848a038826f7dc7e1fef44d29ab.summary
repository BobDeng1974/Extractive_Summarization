by @entity0 more underwater vehicles may be used in the search for the wreckage of @entity4 after a high - tech robotic submarine was forced to return to the surface by the bone - crushing water pressure close to the ocean floor			1
the search area proved too deep for the @entity12 's @entity11 - 21 autonomous underwater vehicle , which was sent down some 2000km north west of @entity13 to begin scouring the seabed for the missing @entity15 after no possible black box pings were detected for six days			1
but just six hours into its planned 16 - hour mission on the sea bed , it exceeded its maximum depth limit of 4.5km and its built - in safety feature automatically returned it to the surface			1
the search area for @entity4 is proving too deep for it to operate , so other vessels may now be deployed @entity34 navy ships @entity35 , left , and @entity36 , right , flank @entity37 as they conduct a replenishment at @entity40 in the southern @entity41 during the hunt for @entity4 @entity34 navy ships @entity13 , left , and @entity35 , right , receive fuel and stores from the @entity46			1
@entity34 prime minister @entity47 raised hopes last week when he said authorities were ' very confident ' the four strong underwater signals that were detected were from the black boxes on @entity52 now @entity53 , the search co-ordinator , has said larger vessels may be required because some parts of the ocean floor are inaccessible to the deep water probe			1
he said the possibility of more vessels is ' being looked at as we speak ' during a press conference			0
meanwhile , the data @entity11 had collected was analysed but nothing of interest was found , the @entity12 said in a statement			1
search crews were hoping to send it back under water today , if weather conditions permit			1
the autonomous underwater vehicle was due to scour the @entity41 floor for 16 hours - but it was brought back up after just six hours because it had reached and then exceeded its maximum operational depth of 4.5km			1
any lower and the water pressure could have caused major damage to the mini submarine			0
' its built - in safety feature returned it to the surface , ' the joint search committee said in a statement			2
authorities knew that any possible wreckage from flight 370 would likely be lying at the limit of the @entity11 's dive capabilities			2
deeper diving submersibles have been evaluated , but none is yet available to help			1
the @entity11 was programmed to hover 30 meters over the seafloor as it moved through the search area , but ended up reaching its maximum depth , triggering the safety feature that returned it to the surface , the @entity12 said			1
it was n't damaged and is being reprogrammed to account for the inconsistencies in the seafloor 's depth			0

a safety mechanism forced it to return to the surface just six hours into the planned 16 hour search @entity11 21 was programmed to hover 30 meters over the seafloor as it moved through the search area , but ended up reaching its maximum depth , triggering the safety feature that returned it to the surface , the @entity12 said a safety margin would have been included in the sub 's program to protect the device from harm if it went a bit deeper than its 4,500 - meter limit , said @entity133 , a professor of marine robotics at the @entity135			1
he said : ' maybe some areas where they are doing the survey are a little bit deeper than they are expecting			0
' they may not have very reliable prior data for the area , so they have a general idea			2
but there may be some variability on the sea floor that they also ca n't see from the surface			0
' meanwhile , officials were investigating an oil slick about 5.5km from the area where the last underwater sounds were detected , said @entity53 , the head of a joint agency coordinating the search off @entity34 's west coast			1
crews have collected an oil sample and are sending it back to @entity13 in western @entity34 for analysis , a process that will take several days			1
mr @entity53 said it does not appear to be from any of the ships in the area , but cautioned against jumping to conclusions about its source			0
the @entity11 can create a three - dimensional sonar map of any debris on the ocean floor			2
but the search in this area is more challenging because the seabed is covered in silt that could potentially cover part of the plane			2
a @entity12 @entity176 takes off from @entity177 as part of a search to locate missing @entity4 an @entity106 returns to @entity180 after a day of searching an area in the @entity41 for the missing @entity52 ' encouraging ' : a total of four signals , matching those of a black box flight recorder , have now been detected by the @entity34 ship @entity185 in the search for flight mh370 retired air chief marshal and head of the @entity34 agency coordinating the search for @entity4 , @entity53 , addresses the media ' what they 're going to have to be looking for is contrast between hard objects , like bits of a fuselage , and that silty bottom , ' mr @entity133 said			2
' with the types of sonars they are using , if stuff is sitting up on top of the silt , say a wing was there , you could likely see that ... but small items might sink down into the silt and be covered and then it 's going to be a lot more challenging			0
' the search moved below the surface after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the past two weeks that were consistent with signals from an aircraft 's black boxes , which record flight data and cockpit conversations			1
the devices emit ' pings ' so they can be more easily found , but their batteries only last about a month and are now believed to be dead			0
@entity34 prime minister @entity47 raised hopes last week when he said authorities were ' very confident ' the four strong underwater signals that were detected were from the black boxes on flight 370 , which disappeared march 8 during a flight from @entity234 , @entity235 , to @entity236 with 239 people on board , mostly @entity239			2
but @entity53 warned that while the signals are a promising lead , the public needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews in the extremely remote , deep patch of ocean			2
' i would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the aircraft wreckage , ' @entity53 said monday			0
' more signals : a handout image released by the @entity257 ( @entity257 ) shows the search area in the @entity41 , @entity259 of @entity34 , where 15 planes and 14 ships are scouring a 75,423 square km area of ocean for the wreckage of flight mh370 more than a month after it disappeared a map from @entity257 shows where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight mh370 the submarine takes 24 hours to complete each mission : two hours to dive to the bottom , 16 hours to search the seafloor , two hours to return to the surface , and four hours to download the data			1
the black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery of what happened to flight 370			0
investigators believe the plane went down in the southern @entity41 based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and an analysis of its speed and fuel capacity			0
but they still do n't know why			0
on tuesday , @entity235 's defense minister , @entity290 , pledged to reveal the full contents of the black boxes , if they are ever found			0
' it 's about finding out the truth , ' he told reporters in @entity234			0
' there is no question of it not being released			0
' up to 11 planes and as many ships were on tuesday scouring a 62,000 square kilometer patch of ocean about 2,200km northwest of @entity13 , hunting for any floating debris			0
but the weeks - long surface search was expected to end in the next two days			2
officials have n't found a single piece of debris confirmed to be from the plane , and @entity53 said the chances that any would be found have ' greatly diminished			0
