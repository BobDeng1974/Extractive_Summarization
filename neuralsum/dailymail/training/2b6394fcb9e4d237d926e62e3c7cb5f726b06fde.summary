by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 25 july 2013 a cruise ship that charges passengers $ 5,000 a week for a ' world class ' culinary experience has been caught storing meat unrefrigerated in crew cabin sinks and trolleys stacked high with blue cheese , milk and eggs in staff corridors			1
disgusted employees , fearing for their health and the health of passengers , anonymously alerted the @entity16 to the conditions aboard the @entity18 by sending in photos of piled up food sitting for hours everywhere but the ship 's galley			1
the tip prompted a surprise health inspection by the @entity16 's @entity25 on june 17 , when the ship was docked at @entity27 , @entity28			1
one staffer , working a 40 - day contract as a pastry chef on the @entity55 - owned vessel , claimed he was forced to sleep in a cabin with two other crew members and a trolley full of salami and unrefrigerated blue cheese to avoid health inspections			2
@entity63 told @entity64 he was so repulsed , he refused to eat the food being served to passengers			0
@entity55 boasts in advertisements and on its website of serving up world class cuisine aboard its line of luxury cruise ships , that hold around 300 passengers			1
trolleys : some 15 trolleys of food , including cheeses and deli meats , were stored each night in staff cabins to avoid inspections but the @entity25 disagreed , giving the @entity82 a damning score of 82 in the inspection when anything under an 84 is a fail			1
in its scathing report , the officials said ' dry foods , spices , canned foods , cooked foods , milk , raw meats , pasteurized eggs , cheeses of all types , baking goods , raw fruits , raw vegetables , and a variety of both hand held and counter model food equipment , pans , dishware and utensils ' were piled up and stored in some 10 crew cabins , each sleeping two to three workers			2
it said foods such as cheeses , sliced and full pieces of deli meats and raw pork were all stored at potentially hazardous temperatures on the deck , and even on and under the beds of crew members			0
kitchen equipment including knives and a large meat slicers were found hidden under blankets in the cabins			0
equipment : kitchen equipment including a large meat slicer and kitchen knives were discovered hidden under blankets and beds in crew cabins world class : the company boasts of offering a world class culinary experience , but at least two people aboard the ship became sick presumably from the food , pictured , aboard the company told @entity64 that the liner was ' deeply disappointed ' by the score and that the result of the inspection was an anomaly , as they 're used to getting grades in the high 90s			1
the spokesman refused to say who gave the command to hide food in cabins or whether anyone was fired			0
on the @entity25 's website , it inticates at least two cases of diarrhea among staff on the ship , no doubt caused by eating the hygienically kept food			0
but despite the abysmal score , all the @entity25 inspectors could do was pour chlorine liquid over the discarded food to prevent it from being used			0
they do not have the power to slap the liner with a fine or stop the ship sailing			2
@entity55 simply has to submit corrective action statements for deficiencies .			0

health officials *conducted* a surprise inspection of the @entity55 ship @entity173 at @entity27 , @entity28 on june 17
came after disgusted employees revealed they were forced to hide 15 trolleys worth of food in their cabins every night ' in order to avoid inspection ' and took photos of raw meat sitting in a sink
the @entity16 released a damning report about the ship , but it does not have the *authority* to fine the company or stop it sailing
passengers *pay* $ 5,000 a week and are told they will receive a ' world class ' culinary experience
@entity55 claims the abysmal inspection results are a ' deeply disappointing ' anomaly
