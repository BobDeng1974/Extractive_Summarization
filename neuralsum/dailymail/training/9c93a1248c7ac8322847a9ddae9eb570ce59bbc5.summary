by @entity1 reporter published : 20:37 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 20:54 est , 20 september 2012 @entity4 , the @entity5 and other multinational corporations have avoided billions in @entity8 taxes by shifting profits offshore and taking advantage of weak , ambiguous sections of the tax code , @entity3 investigators said on thursday			1
@entity4 used ' aggressive ' transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , in part to avoid taxes , said the report by the @entity22			1
in one example , the report said that the @entity26 - based software giant saved $ 4.5 billion in taxes from 2009 to 2011 by shifting assets to @entity16 , a @entity8 commonwealth that offers numerous tax breaks to businesses			1
run around : @entity5 headquarters in @entity33 , @entity31 is seen while the company is said to use offshore loan transactions worth billions to run its @entity8 operations the report , released at a subcommittee hearing , also said that since at least 2008 , @entity5 has used complex offshore loan transactions worth billions of dollars to avoid paying taxes while using the money to run its @entity8 operations			1
the mammoth high tech company has its headquarters in @entity33 , @entity31 ' the bottom line of our investigation is that some multinationals use our current tax system to engage in shams and gimmicks to avoid paying the taxes they owe , ' said sen. @entity54 , @entity55 , who chairs the subcommittee			2
executives of both companies said they have complied with @entity8 tax laws			1
' i can assure the committee that @entity5 takes seriously its obligations to accurately follow accounting principle and to pay taxes that it owes , ' @entity60 , @entity5 's senior vice president for taxes , told the panel			0
the report was released weeks before presidential and congressional elections in which one of the noisiest partisan clashes is over whether - and how - to raise revenues to help reduce federal deficits			0
business practices : @entity4 , their chairman @entity76 pictured who has a net worth of $ 66 billion , is also one of the companies accused of shifting profits offshore for tax breaks many democrats have complained that the government is missing out on collecting billions of dollars because companies are stashing profits abroad , thus avoiding taxes			1
@entity88 want to cut the corporate tax rate of 35 per cent and ease the tax burden on money that @entity8 companies make abroad , which they say would encourage them to invest at home			2
president @entity95 has proposed using the tax code to encourage companies to move jobs back to the @entity8 and discourage them from shifting jobs abroad			2
many in both parties say they want to overhaul the entire tax code , but there are vast differences in how they would do so			0
the investigators ' report , based in part on material subpoenaed from multinational companies , said more than 1,000 such companies reported having more than $ 1.5 trillion overseas			0
@entity8 - based companies can avoid taxes on much money earned abroad by asserting that they have invested those funds offshore or plan to do so			1

he said the findings call ' blatantly and honestly for tax reform in this country			0
' defense : @entity127 @entity116 of @entity117 , who is the @entity3 subcommittee 's top @entity88 , defends the business practices as being legal , even if not wholesome the report said ways that companies reduce their tax liabilities include : - selling or licensing assets developed in the @entity8 to offshore subsidiaries for less than they are worth , in effect minimizing the @entity8 parent company 's tax bill and shifting profits to lower - tax jurisdictions			2
the report said @entity4 sold some intellectual property rights to subsidiaries in @entity17 and @entity18 for billions of dollars less than those subsidiaries earned from the assets - in effect shielding that money from @entity8 taxes			1
- @entity151 regulations , weak @entity153 enforcement and short - term laws that let multinational companies skirt requirements that they pay taxes on royalties , interest or dividend income earned abroad by subsidiaries			1
a 1997 @entity163 rule letting companies decide the type of legal entity they want to be for tax liability purposes , which ' opened the floodgates ' for such firms to avoid taxation , @entity54 said			0

@entity54 said @entity5 used such loans to fund its @entity8 payroll and repurchase its own stock			2
@entity54 said some multinationals ' have effectively and systematically been bringing those offshore profits back by the billions for years through loan schemes like the one described here , and doing so without paying taxes			0

he said while 52 per cent of its revenue comes from the @entity8 , its foreign revenue is growing faster than those earned at home			0
@entity192 said the company has made ' very limited use ' of tax code provisions that allow companies to avoid paying taxes on loans from foreign subsidiaries and some other transactions			2
' @entity4 's tax results follow from its global business , ' @entity192 told the senators			0
' in conducting our business at home and abroad , we comply with @entity8 and foreign tax laws			1
