' the jacket was actually part of a suit , but the skirt did n't fit @entity6 ; she had been on vacation back home in @entity7 and had gained a little weight			1
' she added that it did n't matter that the stunning model , who is now aged 45 , did not fit into the skirt			2
stylish : the editor , seen above in @entity55 on may 7 , said that the 1998 cover broke all the rules ' in fact , it only served to reinforce the idea to take couture 's haughty grandeur and playfully throw it headlong into real life and see what happened , ' ms @entity13 wrote			1
