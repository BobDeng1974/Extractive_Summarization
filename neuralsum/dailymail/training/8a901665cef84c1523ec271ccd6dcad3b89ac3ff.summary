by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 7 october 2013 a mission that will scan @entity3 ' atmosphere to better understand what happened to its water will be launched by @entity6 next month			2
the space agency has given the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) an emergency exemption from the @entity12 government shutdown which is now entering its second week			0
the bus - sized spacecraft , which is due to launch on the 18 of november , will dip to an altitude of 80 miles above the planet ’s surface to sample @entity3 ' entire upper atmosphere			1
@entity3 is thought to have once had huge amounts of water flowing on its surface			2
features such as dry channels and minerals that typically form in water remain to provide a record of its watery past @entity9 , which measures 37 feet long when its solar panels are open , will take about 10 months to reach @entity3 after launch and will then enter orbit at around 12,500 miles an hour			1
the spacecraft ’s aim is to take samples of the gases in the @entity3 atmosphere in the hope of measuring the levels of water vapour and the rate at which it is being lost			1

@entity9 , which measures 37 feet long with its solar panels are open , will take about 10 months to reach @entity3 after launch and will then enter orbit at around 12,500 miles an hour maven is due to launch at 1:28 pm est ( 5.28 pm gmt ) on november 18 , 2013 , for arrival at @entity3 on september 22 , 2014			1
the first fuel burn will insert the spacecraft into a capture orbit with a period of 35 hours - the time it will take to make one complete orbit around @entity3			1
shortly after @entity3 orbit insertion , a second fuel burn will place the spacecraft into its 4.5 - hour period requirement for acquiring data			1
three smaller burns will reduce the closest distance of the spacecraft to around150 kilometers			0
maven will let scientists test theories that the sun 's energy slowly eroded nitrogen , carbon dioxide and water from the @entity3 atmosphere to leave it the dry , desolate world seen today			1
understanding where this water went will provide key clues as to whether life could have survived on the planet			0
‘ @entity9 will help us understand the climate history , which is the history of habitability , ’ said @entity79 , planetary scientist at the @entity80 and @entity9 's principal investigator			0
‘ although @entity9 is not going to detect life , it 's trying to understand the environment that might have been able to support life			0
’ a major reason @entity6 has granted exemption for @entity9 is because the spacecraft will provide communications link support for future landers and rovers on the @entity3 surface , including @entity96			1
the @entity96 currently sends back data using two older satellites - @entity99 and @entity100			0
@entity9 is currently undergoing final preparation and testing before its launch on november 18th			0
@entity6 is continuing to keep workers at @entity105 in @entity106 and elsewhere during the government shutdown to support the @entity108 , where two @entity12 and four others are deployed			0

maven will take 10 months to reach @entity3 and will launch on 18 november
it will dip to an altitude of 80 miles above the planet 's surface to take samples
the bus - sized spacecraft will also will provide communications for future landers and rovers on the @entity3 surface
