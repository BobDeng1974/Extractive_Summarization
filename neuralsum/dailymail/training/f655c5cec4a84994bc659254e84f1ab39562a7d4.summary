' please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no pace in my heart			0
' furthermore , i 'd like to apologize to all of those who i have hurt and offended with my words , and pledge to learn and grow ( and i assure you i have ) from this experience			0

# @entity238 , ' one tweet read			0

' not fair : @entity143 users rushed to defend the girls who @entity1 said ' deserve a spot at a bar ' rather than the @entity45 unimpressed : the @entity250 looked bored and unimpressed by their father 's jokes about turkey clothing : @entity3 wore a maroon dress and cardigan while @entity4 wore a mini kilt with black tights and boots			1
