by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:24 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:24 est , 11 december 2013 a high - speed powerboat inspired by @entity5 biplanes has become the world 's first to ' fly ' above the water on futuristic hydrofoils			1
the makers of the @entity10 claim it can hit speeds of 60mph thanks to its unique design , which lifts the boat clear of the water			1
rather than being driven by an underwater propeller like other boats , it is pulled along by an aeroplane rotor			1
length : 570cm width : 740cm height : 390cm weight : 350 kg expected top speed : 50 knots ( 58mph ) cost : £ 200,000 the small but constant amount of drag is achieved using a specially designed hydrofoil , which is a wing - like structure mounted on struts below the hull of a boat			1
this lifts it out of the water during forward motion			2
it is the first hydrofoiling personal powerboat ever to go on sale on the open market , but potential buyers will have to spend a staggering £ 200,000 if they want one			1
the @entity10 is the result of professional pilot and engineer @entity51 's 10 - year bid to design ‘ the ultimate joy machine ’			1
the makers of the @entity10 claim it can hit speeds of 70mph thanks to its unique design , which lifts the boat clear of the water mr @entity51 , 48 , from @entity58 , said : ‘ i wanted to create a machine that would show all the magic of flying to anybody , even without a pilot license			1
‘ the question of how to combine the sky and the ocean - flying and sailing - into one unique experience would keep me awake at night			0
‘ that is how the next big thing on the water , the @entity10 concept , was born			2
it is the first hydrofoiling powerboat ever to hit the open market - but potential buyers will have to fork out a staggering £ 200,000 if they want one mr @entity51 said the design of the @entity10 was inspired by the era of biplanes beginning with the @entity5			1
a @entity76 ' from the time is pictured the hull of the two - seater 18ft boat is handcrafted from mountain spruce , while its foils are made from carbon fibre and its rotor blade is aeronautical - grade aluminium			1
mr @entity51 said the design of the @entity10 was inspired by the era of biplanes beginning with the @entity5			2
‘ those years in aviation meant the years of freedom , where you could just seat in the plane , start the engine and fly away , ’ he said			0
‘ there were no air traffic controls , flight plans or millions of regulations			0
there was just you , the aeroplane and freedom			0
‘ the same goes for the @entity10			2
there is no pilot license needed - you just start the engine and fly low above the water			0
’ mr @entity51 is also planning a sailing version of the @entity10 with which he hopes to challenge the world record for the fastest wind - powered boat the hull of the two - seater 18ft boat is hand crafted from mountain spruce , ( pictured ) while its foils are made from carbon fibre and its rotor blade is aeronautical - grade aluminium he claims that his boat is the first hydrofoil motor boat available on the market			1
‘ @entity111 offers very reduced water drag compared to ordinary boats and a very smooth ride through rough seas , ’ mr @entity51 said			0
‘ in other words , it needs much less power to achieve greater speeds			0
‘ that means much lower fuel consumption and much lower co2 emissions			0
‘ imagine cruising along the @entity124 in a @entity126 car			0
now you 'll be able to cruise on the sea , ’ he added			0

a @entity58 pilot and engineer have created the @entity10 , which can hit 60mph thanks to its unique design which lifts the boat out of the water
rather than being driven by an underwater propeller like other boats , it is pulled along by an aeroplane rotor
it is the first hydrofoiling powerboat ever to hit the open market but costs £ 200,000 , partly because its hull is handcrafted from mountain spruce
