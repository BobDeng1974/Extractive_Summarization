by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 might have been born without arms - but that is n't stopping him from being a @entity5 pitcher			1
the 54 - year - old lives his life by the mantra of ' no hands			0
no problem , ' and he certainly showed that at the @entity14 ' @entity13 , throwing out the first pitch with his feet			1
@entity1 is hoping to throw the first pitch at 30 @entity5 stadiums as part of his pitch for awareness campaign to draw attention to the amazing abilities of people with disabilities			1
stepping up to the plate : @entity1 approaches the centre of the park as he prepares his 22nd throw winding it up : @entity1 gets prepared to throw the ceremonial first ball in @entity32 on the good foot : @entity1 was born without arms and hands and is traveling the country to promote the pitch for awareness campaign , hoping to draw awareness to the abilities of persons with disabilities he explained to @entity43 in 2011 just how he manages his astonishing foot - throw			1
' basically , i hold the ball with my right foot and step back with my left leg			0
then i lift my left leg into a kick like a real pitcher does			0
' i bring that leg down slowly and the right leg comes up			0
using the momentum that i 've created in my hips when i bring my left foot forward , i get an extra whip and just try to throw straight at the catcher with the ball coming from my right foot			2
' most times it gets there			0
it 's similar to the same way people throw with their arms , but i do it with my legs and feet			2
' here we go : after winding up @entity1 unleashes the ball through the air - it can be seen above his head here caught : the @entity14 ' mascot gets involved in the fun as he plays a part in the big pitch onto the next one : @entity1 has just eight more @entity5 grounds to go to and throw at to complete his challenge @entity1 says his aim is to eventually throw the first pitch at all 30 @entity5 stadiums			1
' i might not make it to 30 , but i ’ll have fun trying , ' he told the @entity84 in 2012			0
' my goal is to help people understand that when you look at a person who has a disability , it does n’t mean that they do n’t have a whole heck of a lot of abilities , including some that you ca n’t even imagine			0
' he was born with congenital bilateral upper amputation , but takes his disability in his stride			1
