by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 20:46 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 03:24 est , 18 march 2013 family breakdown is costing taxpayers almost £ 50 billion a year and the bill is rising fast , a new analysis said yesterday			0
the costs generated by family breakdown - including subsidised housing , crime , health and social care and disrupted education - have gone up by nearly a quarter in just four years			1
the estimates , produced by the @entity14 think tank , include large rises in tax credits for single parents , in housing benefit , in @entity21 and social services spending , and in spending on policing			1
costly : family breakdown is costing taxpayers almost £ 50 billion a year and the bill is rising fast , according to the @entity14 think tank ( file picture ) the report calls on @entity29 to find ways to support families and to put family policy at the forefront of the government ’s interests			1
foundation director @entity36 said : ‘ for too long governments of all colours have ignored the vital output of families and the multi-billion pound cost of their failure			2
‘ this is unsustainable in any economic climate , let along the current one			0
’ the report put the share of tax credit spending attributable to family breakdown at £ 9.79 billion , up from £ 6.31 billion in 2009			2
including other state handouts , the total benefit spending on broken families was put at more than £ 18 billion			2
it calculated that physical health problems accumulated as a result of family break - up cost nearly £ 6 billion , mental health problems £ 1.8 billion , social services £ 5.5 billion , and that almost £ 3 billion is spent looking after children taken into state care as a result of the collapse of their families			1
breakdown : almost £ 3 billion is spent looking after children taken into state care as a result of the collapse of their families ( file picture ) police costs for dealing with crime generated by young people whose lives have been warped by family breakdown is said to be just over £ 5 billion , with a further £ 1 billion going on prison places for the more serious criminals among them			1
the total of £ 46.07 billion compares with £ 37.03 billion in 2009 , when the figures were first compiled , the report said			2
it warned : ‘ the breakdown of relationships , whether married , cohabiting or never stably formed , has far - reaching costs and consequences			0
‘ the emotional distress to those involved is considerable			0
the impact on children ’s life chances is profound			0
‘ there are also costs to society as a whole			0
these include greater needs for financial support as well as increased demand on health , education and criminal justice			1
’ the report added : ‘ the government has recognised the case for investment in the most troubled families and that the failure to support these families effectively undermines the life chances of children			1
‘ the government ’s own figures calculate that the 120,000 most troubled families cost £ 9 billion a year			0
‘ yet the same logic does not seem to have been applied to all families			0
’ it added that the estimates of costs do not include the impact of the latest benefit reforms or spending cuts			1
the £ 46 billion figure amounts to three per cent of the country ’s gross domestic product - its annual earnings - the report said			0
just criminal : police costs for dealing with crime generated by young people whose lives have been warped by family breakdown is said to be just over £ 5bn ( file picture ) the findings come at a time when state figures suggest that a newborn baby has only a 50 per cent chance of living with both parents by the time he or she reaches the age of 16			1
the @entity14 report said that although the majority of married couples stick together , nearly four out of 10 marriages end in divorce , and cohabiting unions are much more likely to break up			1
it said that relationships are under heavy pressure from high housing costs , debt , care costs and long working hours			2
mr @entity36 said : ‘ families in the @entity154 are among the most pressured in @entity155			0
we want to see the government deliver on its state promise of applying a family test to all policy , an initiative that will need political will and courage but does n’t need to add any cost to the country ’s taxpayers			0

costs include housing , crime , health and disrupted education
