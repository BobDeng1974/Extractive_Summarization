@entity2 actress @entity0 was all smiles as she and her boyfriend walked out of court on monday after their arraignment for public sex charges was postponed until january			1
@entity0 , 29 , who claimed that police accused her of being a prostitute when she was arrested in @entity13 in september with @entity14 , hopes to take advantage of a new law in @entity17 which will allow a judge to dismiss her lewd conduct case			1
if the new law is passed in time , @entity0 and @entity14 will appear in court on january 27 and will be sentenced to community service for the controversial arrest , which she initially claimed was sparked by racial profiling by the @entity26			1
scroll down for audio exit : @entity2 ' actress , @entity0 and her boyfriend , @entity14 are all smiles after they leave an @entity13 courthouse after finding out their arraignment for misdemeanor lewd conduct charges is postponed ' we know we did n't do anything wrong and we love each , ' said @entity0 outside the court as she stood next to @entity14			1
asked if the postponement was acceptable , @entity0 ' attorney said that it seemed so according to the @entity44			2
' we 're in the early stages on that right now , but i think all sides would like this to end in a way that benefits everybody positively , ' said her lawyer @entity52 outside the court			0
@entity0 and @entity14 found themselves at the center of a national controversy on september 11 when she claimed that the @entity26 arrested her because she was a prostitute after her and @entity14 were caught involved in an amorous clinch in broad daylight			1
smiling : @entity14 and @entity0 have refused to apologize for their words following their controversial september arrest she claimed the police were heavy - handed and left her ' wrist bleeding in pain ' and claimed the whole affair left her humiliated			1
@entity14 took to @entity69 to specifically claim the @entity26 arrested them because they assumed his girlfriend was a prostitute because they saw an interracial couple			2
a recording of the arrest by one of the officers involved showed that @entity0 accused the police of racism when she refused to produce @entity79 after a series of 911 calls from witnesses claiming a couple was having sex in their car			1
' do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black ? just because i am black and he 's white ? i 'm just being really honest , ' she said to @entity26 sgt. @entity92			0
in the recording @entity0 exclaims ' you are not the one who is in handcuffs ' ' you 're not the one who 's spent your life being called a n --- -- and growing up in the south , and now i get the cops called on me			0
@entity0 ( right ) insisted she was just kissing her boyfriend in the car but witness accounts suggest different an eyewitness in a nearby offfice building said @entity14 was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and @entity0 was straddling him and rocking back and forth pictures obtained by @entity114 show @entity0 straddling her boyfriend @entity115 in his car while the couple steady themselves with their hands on the car sunroof ' the cop pulled us over because he thought i was a prostitute			1
' @entity92 later said in an interview with the @entity124 that he thought it was incorrect for @entity0 to accuse him and the other two officers of prejudice because he is gay and the other two police were a woman and a @entity130			0
@entity92 said he released the audio in an attempt so show that he was simply responding to a 911 calls that told the dispatcher @entity0 and @entity14 were having sex with the door open and was reasonable during their encounter			2
he also added that it was @entity0 ' attitude and uncooperative nature that caused her to be arrested			0
in the immediate aftermath , prominent civil rights leaders took up @entity0 ' cause , but then asked her to apologize when the audio and pictures showing @entity0 sitting on top of @entity14 inside his car were made public			2
sgt. @entity92 , a 25 - year veteran of the @entity26 , says he is speaking out because he 's seen the department become dramatically more sensitive since he 's been on the force however , @entity0 and @entity14 , who could face six months in jail have refused to apologize			2
' i think there was a lot of personal risk involved for me to decide to even make that @entity69 post , ' @entity0 said on monday according to the @entity44			0
' i would n't have made that @entity69 statement if i did n't believe this was an issue that deserves our national conversation and attention			0
' and racial conflict is something that a lot of people do n't want to talk about , because it 's uncomfortable , but if i 'm in a position where people are listening , i 'm going to lend my voice to it			0
' i believe conversations can help us move through these difficult things			0
