by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 13:39 est , 20 november 2013 overgrown with weeds and coated in cobwebs and dust , this tumbledown house and garage packed with rusty cars became a rotting monument to a by - gone age when it was abandoned by the owner			1
packed with rusty gadgets and gizmos , the remote property , dubbed the ' @entity14 ' , has remained largely untouched since its owner left around two decades ago			1
since then the former home , on the outskirts of @entity19 , @entity20 , has been left to crumble , visited only by the odd vandal or thief , and adventurous urban photographers eager to catch a glimpse of the house where time stood still			1
abandoned : overgrown with weeds and coated in cobwebs and dust , this tumbledown house has become a rotting monument to a by - gone age left to rot : a cream @entity32 , with its shattered windscreen and crumpled bonnet - is a sad shadow of its former self lone wolf : this magazine featuring @entity39 from 1990s tv show @entity40 has survived in surprisingly good condition according to neighbours , owner @entity43 moved out of the property several years after the death of wife @entity47 in 1990			1
since he left the main house , filled with a number of obsolete appliances and dated mementoes from a bygone era , it has slowly turned to ruin , while his collection of cars has rusted away or been subjected to vandalism			1
despite apparent efforts to deter trespassers - including signs warning of ' 24 hour cctv ' and a boarded front gate - most of the once - desirable cars have been smashed beyond repair			2
keep out : despite apparent efforts to deter trespassers most of the once - desirable cars have been smashed beyond repair back to nature : an eerie carpet of green moss and mould now covers this once impressive motor stuck record : an old record player has been left propped against this dilapidated car relics : an early model of a digital phone , and a crumpled board game based around @entity78 in @entity79 have been left to rot the garage resembles something of a car graveyard , where classic models , including once pricey sports cars , have turned into battered shells over the years			1
a cream @entity32 , with its shattered windscreen and crumpled bonnet - is a sad shadow of its former self , while others have had their number plates , badges and even petrol caps removed and taken as trophies by thieves			0
a once bright red @entity100 , an orange @entity97 and the sad remains of a @entity99 stand silently , as other vehicles have become covered in a green carpet of moss and mould			0
@entity105 matter : old books have been scattered across the farmhouse , including the remains of an autobiography written by @entity112 veteran @entity111 scrap heap : the garage resembles something of a car graveyard , where classic models , including once pricey sports cars , have turned into battered shells over the years kitchen nightmare : the house 's kitchen is covered with rust and filled with old bottles , while what looks like old bedding has been dumped outside the property the main house and its outbuildings also contain a range of fascinating relics from the past - although the buildings themselves are barely standing			1
one photo shows a 1993 @entity134 supplement featuring @entity39 ' from the prime time saturday night tv show on its covers - remarkably well - preserved despite years exposed to the elements			0
other mementoes dot the site , such as old tape and record players , an early digital phone and even an antiquated electric lawn mower			0
@entity146 tape : this vintage reel - to - reel player was once at the forefront of technology lost soul : this pair of battered old shoes were left behind by the house 's former owner around 20 years ago @entity155 are not sure exactly why mr @entity43 left the property , which was believed to have once been a milk farm , to fall into ruin			1
however , they said the farm was regularly visited by local youths - who they believe are responsible for the majority of damage to the property			0
' i think he moved on after @entity47 died so maybe he wanted to make a fresh start with the new woman ? ' i 'm surprised he just left all those things behind - especially the cars			2
' maybe the memories they held were too strong for him			0
plaything : this discarded toy @entity176 vehicle was found littered alongside the crumbling tyred out : a lonely car tyre is slowly being taken over by vegetation hard work : it would take even the keenest gardener to clear up the overgrown grass surrounding the house with just this abandoned lawnmower one neighbour said : ' from what i heard he upped and left quite quickly - i do n't think they went that far but the house has been empty for years			2
' it 's a shame really because all these things could have gone to museums or been lovingly cared for by collectors			0
' as it is , they 've just been left to rot - or the local kids have smashed them up for a bit of fun			0
' the neighbour believed mr @entity43 still owned the property - inherited from his father @entity204 - and was not aware it had ever been sold on			0
houses nearby in the remote @entity20 countryside can fetch up to Â£ 500,000			2
forgotten : an old beer shandy bottle still contains some liquid , while this old leather boot has cracked and warped after exposure to the elements remnant : this aged hard hat sits on top of a mould - coated car sad song : it is not known if this toy guitar belonged to the owners of the house , or was left behind by a local teenage trespasser exploring the property do you know what happened to mr @entity43 and where he ended up ? contact us at editorial@mailonline.co.uk			2
