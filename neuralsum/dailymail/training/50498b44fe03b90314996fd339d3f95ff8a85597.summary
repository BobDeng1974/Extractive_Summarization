by @entity0 from the surface there is nothing special about the hilly countryside around the city of @entity6 in @entity7			1
however 1,300ft below ground is a stunning salt mine which was first dug by primitive humans around 5,000 years ago			1
despite its incredible age the mine is still in use today and produces more then 500 tonnes of salt each year which is used in cooking and for a range of souvenirs			1
this is the salt mine outside of @entity6 in @entity7 which began being mined in @entity20 and is still in use today the original miners were @entity23 , an ancient race of people who had an empire in the @entity28 and used primitive tools and their hands to extract the salt the pictures were taken by @entity32 , 32 , as part of the 2013 national geographic photography cometition according to a 1971 - 79 survey there is still more than 1billion tonnes of ore left in the mine , which is extracted using machines and underground blasting			1
these pictures were taken by @entity32 , 32 , who was guided through the caves by @entity44 as part of the @entity47 photography contest			1
he said : ' when i first entered the salt cave i was afraid			2
i thought to myself : " what happens if it collapses ? " the mine produces about 500 tonnes of salt every day which is sold on for use in cooking and as souvenirs while temperatures on the surface regularly reach @entity60 ( @entity61 ) they rarely stray above @entity63 ( @entity62 ) in the caves at its deepest point the mine extends down more than 1,300ft ( 400m ) below the ground ' the cave is cool and scentless , which is because it is a very old salt cave			1
the walls are all made of rock salt and the texture is varied because of the digging machines used			2
' the ore extracted from the mine often comes in at 90 per cent purity he added : ' i 've never seen anything like it before			0
the most striking part of the caves is the old gallery , which were dug by @entity23			2
' it 's interesting because they dug this gallery with simple tools and their own hands , unlike today 's methods			0
' while temperatures in the city regularly reach @entity91 ( @entity61 ) , the mercury never strays much above 59 degrees ( @entity62 ) inside the ancient caves			0
the @entity93 were an ancient race who built an empire in the @entity28 which covered most of modern - day central @entity7 , northern @entity97 and @entity98 and flourished between 1,400 and @entity99			1
they were famous for their skill in building and making chariots and wrote in a hieroglyphic - type language called cuneiform			0
they were eventually destroyed after several costly wars , particularly a defeat to the army of @entity111 , pharaoh of the @entity112			0
competition for succession of the throne also drained their resources			0
today the mine has 16 workers and contains a small canteen , a mosque , repair room , workshop and a first aid room			0
all the ore extracted from the mine , which measures in at around 90 per cent purity , is taken by diggers to nearby railway tracks where it is transported to a factory for processing			0
there is so much salt contained in the ground around the mine that it appears around the edge of a nearby lake after being dissolved into the water			2
the @entity23 who first mined here in @entity143 , had an empire which reached from @entity7 into @entity97 and @entity98 the 16 - strong workforce use digging machines and dynamite blasts to extract the salt from the clay soil despite its age a survey in 1979 showed the mine had more than 1billion tonnes of ore still left			1

salt mine is *located* outside of @entity155 in northern @entity7
it was first mined by ancient race called @entity23 in @entity143
despite its age it still produces 500 tonnes of salt a year
