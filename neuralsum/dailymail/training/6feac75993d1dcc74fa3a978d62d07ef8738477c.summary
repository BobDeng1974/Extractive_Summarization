by @entity0 this snake could have chosen anywhere to try and swallow a live frog - so of course , it picked the 17th hole of a busy golf course			1
players were stunned to see the spectacle of nature 's brutality last week in the calm surroundings of @entity12 in @entity13			1
seniors captain @entity14 , 68 , was putting on the 10th green when his friend @entity17 called him over to the 17th			1
as mr @entity14 drew his iphone , the frog - which he had assumed was dead - kicked into life and escaped the snake 's jaws			1
' i was playing a pairs match against @entity43 when @entity17 came running over to see if i had a camera , ' he said			2
' i lay down on the green and managed to get a photograph of the both the frog ’s and the snake ’s eyes			2
' the frog looked dormant and @entity17 thought it might be dead , but then i saw its throat move			1
get off my turf : perhaps thanks to the distraction of the watching golfers , the plucky frog managed to flee giving up : the 3ft grass snake slipped away from its prey as the golfers continued a pairs match against @entity43 ' the frog croaked into life and managed to jump out			2
it looked tired and @entity17 picked it up and put it in the grass nearby			1
' i have never seen anything like it on the golf course			1
' an amphibians expert from @entity68 , a shop and breeding centre in @entity71 , @entity72 , told @entity73 the lucky animal was a @entity75 or @entity77 brown frog ( @entity78 ) , which is native to @entity79			0
measuring up to 6ft long grass snakes are the largest species of snake in @entity79 , but unlike adders they are not venomous			0
they pose no threat to humans but they are dangerous to the small animals on which they feast because of their speed and quick reflexes			0
as the only species of snake in @entity79 to lay eggs , they have jaws big enough to regularly swallow small animals whole			0
but they are preyed on too , and play dead when cornered by predators			0
the snakes subsist mainly on amphibious animals like frogs , toads and newts , as well as the occasional fish			0
they also have a preference for birdies			0
their feelings towards bogeys remain unknown , but are presumably not positive .			0

*display* of nature 's brutality came at 17th hole of course in @entity13
@entity12 captain @entity118 , 68 , looked on in awe
' i have never seen anything like it on the golf course ' , said the golfer
