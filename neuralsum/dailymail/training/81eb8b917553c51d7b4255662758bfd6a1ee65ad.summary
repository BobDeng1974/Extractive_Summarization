by @entity0 shrimpers fishing in the @entity2 accidentally netted a prehistoric looking goblin shark that is the rarest of all sharks ever to be seen by human eyes			1
the goblin shark nabbed off @entity7 , @entity8 which was 18 - feet - long , pink , and has a long snout to conceal it pointy teeth from prey is the second ever of its kind to be seen in the @entity2			1
the goblin shark is known to live in the deep waters of @entity17 and a @entity2 sighting is so rare that its the first in over 10 years			1
the crew of fisherman who made the latest catch had a net 2,000 feet under water and were shocked to find a massive pink shark among the shrimp they catch on a daily basis			2
the prehistoric looking creature sometimes called the ' living fossil ' thrashed on the deck and had teeth so sharp that the fishermen were too afraid to pull out the tape measure and hold it up to the mysterious creature			0
' i did n't even know what it was , ' said fisherman @entity45 to @entity23			0
' i did n't get the tape measure out because that thing 's got some wicked teeth , they could do some damage			0
' instead of keeping the shark to do research , @entity45 decided to snap a quick photo of the fish with his cell phone then release it back into the water			0
@entity45 showed a photo of the shark to his grandson who was thrilled with the discovery			0
' my 3 - year - old grandson , he just loves sharks so i 've been taking pictures of every one we find , when i showed him this one he said , ' wow , @entity64 ! ' @entity45 said			0
the shark was netted on april 19th but it was n't until yesterday that @entity45 reported his catch to the @entity67			2
based on photographs researchers guessed that the shark was a female and at least 18 - feet - long			0
' this is great news , ' said @entity70 , shark connoisseur at @entity67			0
' this is only the second confirmed sighting in the @entity2 , the majority of specimens are found off @entity17 or in the @entity73 and around @entity74			1
' the shark , which was eventually thrown back into the water , is thought to be a female and measure out to 18 feet long scientists know so little about the fish that they ca n't even determine how old or how big it gets			1
however , scientists do know that deep underwater the color red appears black making the shark appear almost invisible to predators and prey			1
researchers also believe that the shark 's long snout is equipped with electrical sensors so that it can find prey even when it ca n't see or hear anything in the depths of the water			2
perhaps the shark 's most frightening feature is its jaw which snaps out like a venus fly trap to catch nearby fish			1
@entity99 and @entity101 marine biologist @entity100 did n't even believe that finding a goblin shark in the gulf was possible			1
' at first i was n't sure if it was even possible for this to happen , but then when the photos came through , it is undeniably a goblin shark			1
it 's a shark ... that 's pink ! for @entity45 , the shark was a catch of a lifetime and he is happy that he threw the animal back in the water			2
' that 's my ocean out there and anything in it concerns me			0
. i know the value of trying to preserve things , ' @entity45 said .			0

the goblin shark is known to live in the deep waters of @entity17 and a @entity2 sighting is so rare that its the first in over 10 years
scientists do n't even know how big or old goblin sharks become
the shark is pink / red in color because in the deep ocean red appears black and makes the shark invisible to predators and prey
the shark has a jaw that snaps open like a @entity138 fly trap
