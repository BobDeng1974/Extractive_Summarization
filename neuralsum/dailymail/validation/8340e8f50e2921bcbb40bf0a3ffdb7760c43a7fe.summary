so you 've been publicly shamed by @entity2 shame stalks the land			1
it wakes us up at three in the morning			1
it inhabits the most secret corners of our lives			1
it ’s a complete waste of time and energy , but for many of us it ’s a lifetime ’s work to get shot of it			1
i think i ’ve lost most of mine , but i still have a little spare if you ’re running short			1
at the same time , the real villains of the piece , the people who really should feel shame for what they have done and continue to do , feel none at all			1
i know a few bankers , and i do n’t know one who feels anything but delight that he and his kind have got away with it			1
so this is an important subject , and a fascinating one			1
two new books consider shame from different points of view			1
@entity2 is a journalist and broadcaster who has built up something of a reputation writing about extremely odd people			1
for this book , however , he has spoken to normal people who found themselves in distinctly abnormal situations			1
for these are people who have been shamed , publicly , humiliatingly , horribly			1
sometimes what they have done is pretty bad ; sometimes what they have done is nothing much at all			1
but in each case , the judgment of the mob has been merciless			2
in his book , @entity2 insists that there is potential in everyone for this merciless judgment ( stock image ) take the case of @entity61 , a young @entity63 pr who tweeted this : ‘ going to @entity66			1
hope i do n’t get @entity67			2
i ’m white ! ’ as jokes go , it ’s definitely at the bad taste end of the spectrum , and it ’s not one i ’d make			2
but the point is : it was a joke			2
one of @entity61 ’s 130 followers on @entity75 retweeted this , then others re- re-retweeted it			2
when she landed at @entity82 airport , there was a text from her best friend			2
‘ you need to call me immediately			2
you ’re the number one worldwide trend on @entity75 right now			2
’ the abuse was astonishing			2
‘ @entity88 is to see @ @entity61 ’s face when her plane lands and she checks her inbox / voicemail			2
’ ‘ we are about to watch this @ @entity61 b * * * * get fired			2
before she even knows she ’s getting fired			2
’ and worse , much much worse			0
a man was waiting at the airport , took a photo of her and posted it online			0
newspapers ran stories on her			0
she had to cut short her holiday because hotel staff were threatening to go on strike if she showed up			0
she was fired from her job and no one else would hire her to do anything			0
her life was ruined over a bad joke			0
@entity2 tells this terrible story in his deadpan way , his sympathies clearly with the victim			1
but he admits that he too has been part of a @entity75 mob monstering some poor fool who had done something he did n’t approve of			0
this is what public shaming amounts to these days			0
justice , says @entity2 , has been democratised			1
not all of his interviewees are so sympathetic			0
take the case of @entity128 , the sharp young @entity130 hack who made up one too many quotes and was shamed into unemployment			1
given the opportunity to apologise at a conference , he found that the hosts had erected a huge screen with a live @entity75 feed behind his head			0
‘ i am not feeling terribly convinced by the deadpan mea culpa droning on by @ jonahlehrer			0
’ ‘ i ca n’t handle watching the @ jonahlehrer apology			0
he is boring and unconvincing			0
’ while he was making his speech ! why not just put him in the stocks and throw rotten tomatoes at him ? what this all amounts to , of course , is bullying			0
worse : self - righteous , vindictive bullying			0
@entity2 ’s book is n’t always the easiest read , although his characteristic wit and wonderful , sinuous way of telling a story guide you effortlessly through the horrors within its pages			1
he is also insistent that the potential for such behaviour is in us all			1
and while you ’re thinking ‘ no , not me ’ , he tells you a story that so incenses you that you can imagine taking action against the malefactor yourself			0
he is a clever man and this is a magnificent book , subtly argued , often painfully funny and yet deeply serious , and absolutely of the moment			1
i ’m not sure i can recommend it highly enough			0
@entity170 ? by @entity171 ( @entity172 £ 17.99 ) for @entity171 , shame is not so much a scourge as ‘ a tool that we can put to use to help solve serious problems ’			0
this young @entity130 environmentalist wishes to make corporations behave better			0
if we are to save the planet , then just buying dolphin - friendly tuna and energy - saving lightbulbs is n’t going to do it			0
no , we have to shame companies into doing what we want them to			0
we can do this in much the same way that @entity2 ’s trolls have			1
shame is ‘ more salient to public life than ever before , since the power to use it has been wrested away from opinion leaders and the state and put increasingly in the hands of citizens ’			0
@entity171 ca n’t write for toffee , but her manifesto for change deserves our respect			0
i still prefer @entity2 ’s book , though , which sits uncomfortably in the memory , like something you did long ago , and really wish you had n’t .			1

@entity2 has a reputation for writing about extremely odd people
he has spoken to normal people who have been humiliatingly shamed
in his book he insists the potential for such behaviour is in all of us
