by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 29 august 2013 @entity2 : 19:50 est , 29 august 2013 in an all - too familiar echo of @entity6 ’s ‘ dodgy dossiers ’ , the government had yesterday published an intelligence report to support @entity9 ’s case for strikes against the @entity12 regime			1
it concluded it was ‘ highly likely ’ that president @entity14 was responsible for launching chemical attacks against his own people			1
but like the ‘ dodgy dossiers ’ , which claimed in 2002 that @entity19 had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction , mr @entity9 ’s report contained the assessment of the @entity23			1
looking back : the government 's intelligence report to support @entity9 's case for strikes against the @entity12 regime had an all - too familiar echo of the ' dodgy dossiers ' from @entity6 ( pictured ) in an attempt to convince mps and the public that attacks were imperative , mr @entity9 had released a two - page letter from the @entity23 , along with its one - page assessment			1
but the report did not detail how spy chiefs reached their conclusions			0
it stated that to the ‘ highest possible level of certainty ’ the @entity12 regime had used chemical weapons on ‘ 14 occasions from 2012 ’			0
without providing any obvious evidence , they had concluded this showed a ‘ clear pattern of regime use ’ of chemical weapons			0
the @entity23 , which includes the heads of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , had found there was ‘ no credible evidence ’ that opposition fighters had deployed nerve agents which killed at least 350 civilians			2
comparison : like the ' dodgy dossiers ' , which claimed that @entity19 ( pictured ) had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction , mr @entity9 's report contained the assessment of the @entity23 but it had failed to answer a string of questions such as why chemical weapons were used when @entity70 inspectors were in @entity12 , and who gave the order to deploy poison gas			1
persuasion : prime minister @entity9 had released a two - page letter from the @entity23 , along with its one - page assessment it even admitted : ‘ the @entity23 had high confidence in all its assessments except in relation to the regime ’s precise motivation for carrying out an attack of this scale at this time – though intelligence may increase our confidence in the future			2
’ acknowledging the disquiet lingering ten years on from the ‘ dodgy dossiers ’ , mr @entity9 told the @entity91 : ‘ i am of course deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts and in particular the deep concerns in the country caused by what went wrong with the @entity99 conflict in 2003			1
’ at the time mr @entity6 justified dragging the @entity100 into the bloody conflict by publishing two dossiers claiming @entity99 had weapons of mass destruction			0
but it emerged that the evidence was limited , misleading and patchy , with chunks of intelligence ‘ spun ’ or fabricated			0
however , yesterday ’s report was markedly different from the @entity6 dossiers , as its language reflects probabilities rather than certainties that @entity14 ’s regime carried out the chemical attack			1
the government had also claimed that military action against @entity12 would be legal even if @entity100 failed to get a fresh @entity70 resolution			0
in a highly unusual move , @entity9 ordered the release of a brief summary of the government ’s ‘ legal position ’ for launching retaliatory strikes against @entity14			2
the 660 - word document was effectively a summary of the advice drawn up for the @entity128 by attorney general @entity129			0
the prime minister had told mps the ‘ excellent ’ advice made it clear that intervention on humanitarian grounds would be legal even without a @entity70 resolution .			0

report concludes it 's ' highly likely ' that @entity14 was responsible for attacks
' dodgy dossiers ' claimed in 2002 @entity19 had stockpiled @entity142
*similarly* , @entity130 's report contained @entity23 's assessment
