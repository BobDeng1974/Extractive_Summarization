new diet pill : @entity0 , which was granted approval for sale in the @entity3 on wednesday , is a combination of the antidepressant bupropion and @entity7 's formulation of naltrexone , designed to prevent drug dependence the @entity6 in june had delayed its decision on the drug by three months due to concerns about adequate warnings on the packaging			1
because @entity0 contains an antidepressant , it will carry a warning about increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors			2
@entity0 joins @entity34 's @entity33 's @entity32 , both approved in 2012 , in the battle to be the treatment of choice and at least one analyst expects the new entrant 's sales to top that of its rivals by 2016			1
the two existing treatments were billed as potential blockbusters but have had lukewarm sales , hurt by bungled launches and marketing strategies , as well as adverse effects ranging from depression to heart risks			0
the drugs also face reimbursement challenges			0
government and private health insurers are reluctant to cover @entity32 and @entity33 , unconvinced of their long - term efficacy and given that patients often drop out of the treatment			2
' for all the obesity drugs that are out there , only 30 to 40per cent of the health maintenance organizations pay for obesity coverage , ' said @entity64 , co-portfolio manager at @entity65 , which holds a stake in @entity7			1

contrave sales are expected to be about $ 200million in 2016 , slightly higher than @entity32 's $ 180million and well ahead of @entity33 's $ 150million , said @entity71 , who covers all three companies			1
@entity77 reported @entity32 sales of $ 5.7million in 2013 , with $ 5.3million of that attributable to its partner @entity80 's sales were $ 23.7million			0
reimbursements will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future until insurers are convinced they can be justified even without improvements in cardiovascular health			0
' if these obesity cardiovascular outcomes trials do show that they reduce heart attacks , or hospitalizations , then ... the market would be reignited , ' said @entity64 , a trained cardiologist			0
@entity7 's @entity0 , slated to enter @entity92 before both @entity33 and @entity32 , is licensed in @entity93 to @entity94 it will be marketed by a 900 - strong sales force , compared with @entity77 and partner @entity96 's 600 and @entity34 ' even smaller sales force			1
historically , weight loss drug developer 's have met with regulatory ire , as debilitating side effects associated with their pills led to their forced removal			1
among these are the notorious ' fen - phen ' combination that was pulled out in 1997 due to heart valve problems and @entity109 's @entity108 , taken off the market in 2008			2
