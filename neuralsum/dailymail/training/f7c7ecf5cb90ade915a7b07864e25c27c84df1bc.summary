by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:25 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 13:44 est , 16 november 2012 the @entity4 ’s £ 1billion new hunter - killer submarine is riddled with technical problems and can not sprint away from an attack , it was claimed last night			1
@entity7 , supposed to be the most advanced ever built in @entity8 , has suffered problems with the propulsion which means it can not reach its top speed			1
one source described the vessel as having ' a v8 engine with a @entity16 gearbox '			1
troubled : a diagram of @entity7 revealing its catalogue of technical complaints warship : the @entity4 submarine @entity7 has been beset by design issues the nuclear - powered submarine , which is the first of a set of seven and is not yet formally ready , was ' launched ' in 2007 by its patron the @entity26			1
but the warship - dubbed ' @entity27 ' - has since been beset by misfortune - including a navigation error which led to it running aground in 2010 , and the murder of an officer on - board in 2011 by a junior member of the crew			1
yesterday a catalogue of technical failings were also revealed , including complaints that the periscope does not provide good enough images			2
the @entity42 said there had been complaints that the periscope , which goes up and down but carries a camera to beam pictures down into the vessel , was simply projecting images of waves washing over the camera			0
the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) had stated that the submarine would be able to make 29 knots , but it has reportedly failed to achieve this			2
@entity56 : @entity7 was hailed as a technological marvel when it was launched in 2010 the issue is said to have been caused because - rather than building a new power plant for @entity7 - the @entity52 opted to use the reactor used in the much bigger @entity63 submarines			1
@entity7 also had to perform an emergency surfacing during a routine dive because of flooding , the @entity42 reported			1
other concerns highlighted include corrosion and the replacement or moving of computer circuit boards because they did not meet safety standards			2
the @entity52 confirmed the latter had not been fitted according to @entity73 and have since been reinstalled			0
responding to corrosion problems , which were identified on @entity7 and the second @entity77 class submarine @entity78 , a spokesman said : ' all @entity4 submarines are subject to a continuous , thorough assessment of their components to minimise the risk of corrosion			1
' concerns were also raised over the wrong type of lead being used in its nuclear reactor monitoring instruments , although the @entity52 said it would have no effect on the accuracy of any readings or any impact on the submarine 's operation			1
on the issue of the submarine 's propulsion and speed , the authority said it would not comment , although it explained any issues would be examined and used to improve the other submarines in production			1
the spokesman added : ' @entity7 ’s sea trials were designed to rigorously test all aspects of the submarine to meet the exacting standards required for operations			1
grand opening : the @entity26 with the @entity110 and @entity112 's managing director of submarine solutions @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , where she launched the vessel powerful : @entity8 's first ' super-sub ' @entity7 when it was first launched weapon : the missile storage room of ' jinxed ' vessel @entity7 , which had to be fixed after a series of technical faults ‘ it is normal for first of class trials to identify areas where modifications are required and these are then incorporated into later vessels of the class			1
‘ these will be the most technologically advanced submarines ever to serve with the @entity4 and will provide an outstanding capability for decades to come			0
’ it is understood that the leakage incident , which happened during exercises off the east coast of the @entity137 , saw several litres of sea water entering the submarine a @entity52 spokesman said of the incident : ' during trials last year @entity7 experienced a leak which was immediately isolated and the submarine returned safely to the surface			1
calamity : @entity7 after it ran aground off the @entity149 in october 2010 able seaman @entity150 ( left ) , who was handed a life sentence for shooting lieutenant commander @entity152 ( right )			1
he was reportedly angry over losing the chance of deployment on a surface ship after disobeying an order to help scrub @entity7			1
' an investigation found one small part which had not been made of the correct material had corroded			0
' a replacement was fitted at sea and the submarine continued with her programme			2
' @entity165 has carried out a full assessment which concluded all similar parts were fitted correctly			0
' each of the the seven vessels , which are all due to be completed in 2024 , costs £ 1.3billion			0
with their new capabilities , they have been designed to progressively replace the @entity172 currently in service			0
@entity7 is yet to start formal service			1
tragic : police at the scene in @entity178 docks after the fatal shooting the @entity7 is the first of new seven boats designed to bring the @entity4 into a new era of seafaring			1
eight were originally commissioned , but only seven will be made due to budget restrictions			0
the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) last year warned of the spiralling cost of the @entity7 programme			2
@entity7 was supposed to have been launched in 2005 , but technical difficulties pushed back its completion until 2009			1
the @entity186 are predicting the programme is now almost £ 2bn over budget			0
it also said that each of the @entity7 class submarines will be 28 months late , with the seventh boat not being in service for another decade			2
@entity165 , which is responsible for building the @entity7 fleet , told the @entity42 : ' safety is of paramount importance to every stage of the design , build , test and trials of a submarine and is at the heart of everything we do			1
' before entering full service , every submarine is required to complete an exhaustive period of sea trials , which are designed to prove the vessel 's capabilities			2
' these trials also present an opportunity to improve performance by resolving any issues that may come to light during this time , which is not uncommon on a first - of - class submarine			2
' the technical failings are the latest in a series of misfortunes in the ship 's short history			0
when it ran aground in october 2010 , it emerged the commander was taking a shower only minutes before			0
the embarrassing detail was included in an official inquiry which found a catalogue of errors had led to the incident			0
it was also revealed the officer on the bridge at the time was not using the correct radar , did not have a chart and was not used to navigating in the dark			0
the @entity4 's humiliation was compounded when a rescue vessel crashed into @entity7 , causing even more damage			2
the cost of repairs to the sub is understood to have run into hundreds of millions of pounds			0
above water : @entity7 leaving @entity115 in 2009 for the first of her sea trials nobody was court martialled over the incident , but the @entity4 said three officers had been disciplined			2
the @entity52 refused to name those who were blamed , but @entity258 , 47 , lost his post a month after the incident			0
last year , able seaman @entity261 , admitted murdering lt cdr @entity152 , 36 , of @entity262 , @entity263 , on the submarine			0
sentencing him , a judge at @entity266 told @entity150 , 22 , of @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , that he must serve at least 25 years			0
@entity150 also admitted the attempted murders of lt @entity271 , 45 , petty officer @entity272 , 36 , and chief petty officer @entity273 , 37			0
at work : @entity7 's crew carrying out checks on the warship 's missiles prior to them being loaded ( file picture ) the court heard how he was resentful after after being told he would not be attached to the @entity283 ship @entity284 because he had disobeyed orders to clean part of the submarine			1
the incident cast a shadow over a ship that was intended as the forebear of a new generation of billion pound machines set to bring the @entity4 into the 21st century			0
in spite of being four years late and £ 900million over-budget , @entity7 was hailed a technological marvel when she was first unveiled to the public in 2007			2
with machinery more complex than a space shuttle , and the ability to circumnavigate the globe without surfacing , the 7,400 - ton piece of equipment was the largest and deadliest hunter - killer submarine ever built			1
as long as a football pitch , at 318ft , and as wide as four double - decker buses , it was a third longer than any sub which had gone before			0
in spite of its speed , the stealth warship makes less noise than a baby dolphin , making it undetectable to enemy ships			0
her sonar is so advanced that if she was lying in the @entity317 she would be able to detect ships leaving @entity320 harbour 3,000 nautical miles away , although the details of how this is done are classified			0
the sub carries 38 @entity325 cruise missiles , with a range of 1,240 miles , and can attack targets in @entity328 with pinpoint accuracy while sitting off the coast of @entity331			0
the technical failings of @entity7 are the latest in a series of errors and controversial decisions by ministers in charge of state protection			1

@entity342 killer submarine @entity7 is beset by technical problems
concerns have been raised over its *inability* to reach top speed and keep pace with new *aircraft* carriers
@entity352 said @entity7 ' has a v8 engine with a @entity355 gearbox '
it has also seen flooding and badly - installed equipment
