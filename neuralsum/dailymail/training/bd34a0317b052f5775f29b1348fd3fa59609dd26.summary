by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 17:58 est , 8 september 2012 storms delayed the start of the @entity4 semi-final and when it finally began @entity5 ensured the electric atmosphere transferred to the court as he became embroiled in an angry row after his cap was blown off			1
the incident happened during @entity5 's tough victory over @entity13 of the @entity14 which set up him for a final clash scheduled for tomorrow against either @entity16 or @entity17			1
from the start of the match windy conditions disrupted play causing the net sensor to go off in the opening game			2
cool it : the umpire appeals for calm as @entity5 and @entity13 argue at the net after the @entity29 's hat was blown off his head then , with @entity33 on break point in the fourth game , he raced towards the net and as he successfully reach a short ball his white baseball cap flew off			1
@entity13 failed to get @entity5 's response however , and umpire @entity37 initially awarded the point to @entity5			1
@entity13 , who has a winning record against @entity5 , then approached the umpire and argued he had been put off by the flying hat and the pair became engaged in an argument			2
@entity5 also approached the chair and could be heard asking @entity13 if was certain he had been distracted by the flying hat			1
he repeated : ' i 'm just asking if you 're 100 percent sure			0
' @entity46 decided to replay the point and an attempted lob by @entity5 sailed out of the court giving @entity13 the break of serve			1
a furious @entity5 then hit a ball in anger , grabbed the hat and dumped it on the sideline , saying ' nonsense , nonsense , nonsense			0
' but , although @entity5 went on to lose a tight first set , it was he who ultimately coped with the conditions better , surviving a fightback in the fourth set from @entity13 to win 5 - 7 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 6 ( 9/7 ) in three hours and 58 minutes			1
it will be the 25 - year - old 's second consecutive grand slam final after his @entity67 loss to @entity68 and his second @entity4 final , with his first experience of a major showpiece coming here in 2008 , when he also lost to @entity68			1
roaring success : @entity5 reached his second @entity4 final and fifth grand slam showpiece talking about the conditions afterwards to @entity77 , @entity5 said : ' you have to focus for every point			1
the chairs were flying onto the court , it was hard to serve			0
' it 's some of the hardest conditions i 've ever played in and i come from @entity86 so that 's saying something			0
' he added : ' from the end of the first set i was in control			0
at 3 - 0 in the fourth i had three break points , but from the far side of the court it was very tough so i got broken in the next game			0
i just tried to hang in there and i did a good job at the end			0
' the result also means @entity5 will overtake @entity103 to become the new world number three , but most importantly it gives him the chance to claim his first grand slam title			0
beaten : @entity13 lunges in vain as a shot from @entity5 whizzes past him @entity5 will meet either defending champion @entity16 or @entity109 's @entity17 in the final and , asked if he feels this is his time after winning @entity113 gold , @entity5 said : ' i hope so			1
you can never say for sure , i know how hard these tournaments are to win			0
@entity17 and @entity16 are top , top players			0
' when the conditions are like this , anything could have happened			0
i 'll give everything in the final			0
' @entity5 went into the match as the favourite by ranking and experience at the latter stages of grand slams but also knowing @entity13 had won four of their six previous matches			2
the big - hitting @entity14 had also served notice of what a threat he would be by blasting past @entity68 in the quarter - finals			0
the wind was certainly the winner in the early stages as the stands slowly filled up and planes roared overhead			0
@entity5 piled the pressure on @entity13 in a lengthy third game and got the break when the sixth seed drilled a forehand just wide			1
@entity5 thought he had saved a break point in the next game but @entity13 protested he had been distracted by his opponent 's hat blowing off and , after a heated exchange between the two men and umpire @entity37 , the point was replayed and the @entity14 broke back to 2 - 2			1
@entity13 was struggling with his ball toss to such an extent that at times he was serving at little more than 80mph but he was certainly hitting the ball cleanly off the ground			0
nice finish : @entity5 wins a point with a cool shot at the net holding serve into the wind was the main problem and @entity5 was furious with himself that he did not put more pressure on his opponent in the 11th game			2
that left him serving to stay in the set for a second time and he could not manage it , the @entity29 struggling to keep his cool as @entity13 broke through with a mighty swipe of his forehand			2
@entity5 was clearly fired up and immediately had three break points at the start of the second set , taking the second when @entity13 pushed a forehand long			2
the @entity29 seemed to be enjoying himself a bit more now , taking on the challenge instead of being frustrated by it , and he broke again to lead 4 - 1			0
on the attack : the powerful @entity13 won the first set , but @entity5 's nous won through @entity13 held to force the third seed to serve out the set , but no sooner had @entity5 thrown the ball up for his first serve than a gust of wind blew his chair and racquet bag across the court			1
the @entity14 laughed at the impossibility of playing tennis in such conditions but on they went and @entity5 duly wrapped up the set			0
the @entity29 , who was being watched by countryman @entity195 , began the third set as he had the second , with a break of serve , as @entity13 shot an exasperated look towards his supporters			2
@entity5 's greater variety and tactical acumen suited the conditions much better than the @entity14 's raw power and another break for 3 - 0 gave him a firm hold on the match			1
serving up a treat : @entity5 's craft and guile was there for all to see across four compelling sets mentally , @entity13 seemed to have gone walkabout and , although he saved four set points at 1 - 5 , a fifth arrived and this time the @entity14 drilled a forehand just long			1
@entity13 's hopes of making a second grand slam final were hanging by a thread , and they took another hit when @entity5 broke again in the second game of the fourth set			1
the sixth seed stopped the run of games against him at five , saving more break points , and that seemed to revitalise him as he then created a rare opening on the @entity5 serve and took it			2
all smiles : @entity229 shares a joke with @entity5 's girlfriend @entity231 suddenly it was a match again , albeit one that was still very much in the third seed 's hands , but if he was going to win it in four sets it would have to be in a tie - break			2
@entity5 was unfortunate that he started the game at the more difficult end and @entity13 raced into a 4 - 1 lead , but the @entity29 recovered the deficit when they switched ends , levelling at 5 - 5 with an angled backhand return			1
blustery : @entity13 observes as chairs and debris are sent in all directions by the wind @entity13 played a good point to move 6 - 5 in front but @entity5 saved the set point and then brought up his first match point only to see the @entity14 fire down an ace			2
@entity13 erred with his forehand , though , to give @entity5 a match point on his own serve , and another mistake from the @entity14 sent his opponent leaping around the court in delight			1
the second semi-final between @entity16 and @entity17 in the @entity263 had to be postponed due to the heavy rain			0
keeping cool : @entity195 was an involved spectator rain falls on @entity263 in @entity266 causing the postponement of the semi-final clash between @entity16 and @entity17			0

opponent claimed he was distracted when @entity5 's cap was blown off
@entity273 decided to replay *controversial* point and @entity13 went on to break @entity5 's serve
@entity5 heard *muttering* ' nonsense , nonsense , nonsense ' as he walked off the court after losing game
ultimately the @entity29 coped better with windy conditions and is through to tomorrow 's @entity4 final
