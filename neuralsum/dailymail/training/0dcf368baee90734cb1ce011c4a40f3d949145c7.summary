@entity1 champions are rarely motivated by revenge but @entity3 have more than one reason for wanting payback against @entity6 on sunday for @entity3 goalkeeper @entity8 there is the memory of a costly mistake at @entity11 last october that led to him being dropped and the feeling that he is still not fully trusted by @entity13			1
for @entity13 , there is the irritation that after two @entity1 defeats by @entity6 last season , people consider @entity19 to be tactically superior			1
@entity3 keeper @entity8 and defender @entity20 collide during the clash at @entity6 last season @entity8 looks on in despair as his error results in @entity3 losing at @entity6 when two men dislike each other as much as they do , that has to hurt			1
it helps to build a rivalry fast approaching @entity30 - @entity29 in the grudge stakes			0
both sides were touted as title contenders before a ball had been kicked — but @entity3 already trail by five points			2
then there is the personal stuff			0
it is 11 months since @entity8 gifted a late goal to @entity40 in @entity6 ’s 2 - 1 victory			1
@entity42 dropped his keeper for three months and only now , after an outstanding display against @entity45 , has @entity8 proved himself to be back to his best			2
‘ i love playing football , whether it ’s against @entity45 , @entity6 or @entity48			2
' but i have to play well to get the opportunity to keep on loving it , ’ admits @entity8 , who acknowledges his side can not allow @entity6 to win if @entity3 want to retain their crown			1
‘ last year ’s results against @entity6 were really tough pills and nearly cost us dearly			2
' we did end up as champions but we ’re not champions this year so we need a result			2
‘ we ’re obviously expecting a tough game — @entity6 are a good side , very powerful			2
@entity8 has revenge on his mind when @entity3 entertain title rivals @entity6 on sunday @entity13 dropped @entity8 after his clanger at @entity6 last season but the @entity66 has recovered well from the setback and gone on to impress for club and country ever since ' they have improved since last year , but so have we			1
i ’d say we ’re a better team			0
we ’ve had a good year under the manager , we understand			0
him a lot more and we ’ve in bought a few good players			0
’ @entity8 , who is waiting for a contract offer indicating @entity13 really wants to keep him , does not have the luxury of being undisputed no 1			1
@entity13 has signed @entity78 and @entity8 has no option but to fight for his place			1
‘ there is no malice or back - stabbing between the goalkeepers			0
we both want to catch the manager ’s eye , ’ said the @entity66 keeper			0
‘ it is the reality of the situation , i ca n’t moan about it and i ca n’t be too happy about it , and if i want to stay it ’s going to be the reality			0
i ’ve got players challenging and i have to enjoy it every day			0
’ @entity13 , on the other hand , has sounded off against referees and @entity97 after an indifferent start and is surprised people remember @entity6 ’s wins against @entity3 but forget he got the better of @entity19 , who mocked the @entity101 for not winning the league at @entity103 , with a 2 - 0 fifth - round @entity105 win			1
despite @entity6 ’s 15 goals in four games , @entity13 still sees @entity19 as a defensive coach			1
‘ we know exactly the way @entity6 play and they do it very well because they are used to doing it that way , ’ he said			2
‘ and we must continue playing our way			0
we wo n’t change because we lost 1 - 0 in february to a goal from @entity114			0
’ @entity6 ’s threat could come from in - form @entity116 , but @entity3 boss @entity13 has @entity118 in his ranks			1
@entity13 seems resigned to the fact that @entity19 has had as much credit for masterminding a win at the @entity123 as the @entity101 did for winning the title			1
‘ i am not annoyed or surprised about anything , ’ he mutters unconvincingly			0
it seems that revenge is definitely in the air .			0

@entity6 visit @entity3 on sunday at the @entity123
@entity8 is keen for revenge after his error led to @entity3 losing at @entity11 last season *courtesy* of a @entity40 injury - time goal
@entity13 then dropped @entity8 as a result of the mistake and a *general* run of poor form
ever since the blip @entity8 has gone from **strength** to **strength** for club and country
@entity13 and @entity6 boss @entity19 have had *disagreements* in the past , in particular the clash at @entity11 last season
champions @entity3 are currently five points behind the *leaders* @entity6
