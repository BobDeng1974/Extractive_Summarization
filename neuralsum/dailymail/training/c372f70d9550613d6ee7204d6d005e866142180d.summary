@entity0 does not regret cupping his ear in an act of defiance to the boo - boys who jeered his @entity6 side off after last season 's home win over @entity9			1
an unconvincing 2 - 1 victory over the @entity11 , who were reduced to 10 men , saw the @entity6 players greeted with howls of derision at full - time , with @entity0 responding by turning and cupping his ear to the crowd			1
a number of @entity6 fans had turned on the @entity6 manager after a season which did not live up to expectations , although the win over @entity9 took them up to 11th in the @entity27 table at the time			1
@entity6 manager @entity0 reacts to the boos after the 2 - 1 win over @entity9 last season @entity31 takes his @entity9 side back to @entity33 on sunday and it will be the visitors who are under more pressure for a result this time out as they go into the game inside the relegation zone			1
@entity6 have enjoyed a better start to the season and sit eighth , just one point shy of the 34 they had amassed after the win over @entity9 last march 31 games into the campaign			1
and @entity0 revealed ahead of the clash that he resorted to the gesture to detract from fans directly criticising the players - and was happy to take the heat instead			1
' i 've never had a problem with the fans cheering or booing , ' he said			0
' it is part of the game , part of what you have to accept - part of a life today that has become ever - more demanding			2
@entity6 were buoyed by midweek penalty shootout victory over @entity63 in the @entity64 ' people that pay money are allowed to express their opinion whether you think it is right or wrong			1
my fear was how much it affected the players , not how much it affected me			0
' i would take the stick , i would take the pressure off them by creating the cupping of the ear			2
i thought it was unfair at that particular time			0
' they could vent their anger at me , no problem			0
but keep away from the players because if you affect them then they do n't play here , then they are frightened to play here			0
' when they get to that stage they ca n't perform to their best and it is a vicious circle then			0
at that particular time it was about winning , it did n't matter how we won as long as we won - and we did win			2
' @entity6 are currently eighth in the @entity27 after collecting 33 points from 21 games @entity0 felt the frustration came from the terraces after a season which could have ended with relegation , but this campaign things are different and the 60 - year - old believes his players are shining because of that			1
' it was a hugely important victory but i was n't surprised , ' he said			0
' i knew we were n't playing as well as we should have done and because 10 men sit back and say ' break us down ' fans get really frustrated			2
' frustration can over-spill into an emotion and that happens in football			0
but it moves on and it is chip paper			0
it is not water under the bridge , it is in the @entity121 it is that far gone			0
it was a difficult period last year because we were where we were			0
' we were all worried about getting relegated and the fans were going : ' here we go again , how are we going to get out of this ? ' but we did and this year there is a whole different vibe around the place because of how the players have thrilled the fans , especially at home			0
@entity134 and @entity135 are likely to start against @entity9 on sunday ' the fans will always stay with the team , even if the team is behind , if we are playing well			2
' despite their improved points tally , the @entity6 have not won in their last four league outings and will be hopeful of putting that right at the expense of @entity9			1
@entity0 has a near - fit squad to select from with only @entity144 and @entity145 missing , the latter having linked up with @entity146 ahead of the @entity147			1
@entity144 was also initially called into the same squad but pulled out after suffering a back injury , with @entity0 criticising the @entity146 medical staff for mistreating a previous ailment			2
@entity0 admits he is unsure when he would be free to select @entity144 again once he has overcome the back issue so @entity134 and @entity135 are likely to start against @entity9 , with @entity153 once again on the bench despite scoring as a substitute in the @entity64 third - round penalty shoot - out win over @entity63 on tuesday .			1
