however , the home side 's first corner in the 26th minute caused panic in the visiting defence			0
@entity45 's cross was cleared only to @entity6 ' midfielder @entity50 , whose shot from the edge of the box was deflected up into the air with @entity61 almost putting though his own goal , his wayward header saved by @entity59 with the @entity79 keeper then blocking a close - range effort from @entity51			2
