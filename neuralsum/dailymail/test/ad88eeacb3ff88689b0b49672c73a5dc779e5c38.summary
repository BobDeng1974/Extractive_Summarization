it 's not every day two senior barristers in the nation 's highest court go head to head over the fate of a pooch on death row			0
but on tuesday in @entity10 that 's exactly what happened			0
condemned @entity14 terrier @entity12 is set to be destroyed after she bit a woman in august 2012 after escaping from her owner @entity16 's backyard in @entity18 , east @entity19 , @entity20			1
lawyers for @entity20 woman @entity16 appealed to the @entity22 hoping to have her @entity14 terrier , deemed aggressive by @entity24 , saved from being put down			2
the woman who @entity12 bit suffered a 1.5cm to her finger on august 4 in 2012 , which is deemed as a ' serious injury ' under the @entity30 in @entity20 law , and @entity12 was seized by the council in june 2013			1
this is the first time a dog on death row is having its case heard in @entity38 's highest court			1
condemned @entity14 terrier @entity12 is set to be destroyed but could be saved by a final @entity22 bid @entity41 , representing ms @entity16 , argued a member of the panel which determined @entity12 's fate had a conflict of interest			1
@entity46 investigated the attack @entity12 made in august 2012 and presented evidence at a later @entity49 in which ms @entity16 pleaded guilty			1
ms @entity46 then informed her about a panel hearing to determine the dog 's fate , before participating in it and helping to draw up the final reasons , mr @entity50 said			0
' ms @entity46 had a fundamental part in the process of decision making , ' he told the court , claiming she was both the accuser and acting as judge			0
justice @entity63 took exception to that characterisation criticising the lawyer for ' sliding into personal attacks '			0
' well , i 'll desist , ' mr @entity50 conceded			0
lawyers for the council argued there was no judge in the case , but rather an administrator making an administrative decision			2
@entity76 acknowledged ms @entity46 played a role on the panel , but said the final decision was made by another member			0
ms @entity16 had three @entity14 terriers , including @entity12 , which were involved in attacks on other dogs after escaping from her backyard in @entity18 , a suburb in @entity19 's east			0
in 2013 she pleaded guilty to a charge relating to an 1.5cm cut allegedly caused by @entity12 on the middle finger of a woman trying to pull the dog away from her daughters			1
a dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in the @entity22 of @entity38 the dog has been housed by the @entity99 since it was seized two years ago , sparking a lengthy legal battle			1
lawyers representing the dog at no cost to the client say the local council that is fighting for @entity12 's destruction in the @entity22 is wasting public money by perusing the case			1
city of @entity24 council has refused @entity99 @entity38 's offer to rehabilitate the pet and assume all liability for her at no extra cost from the time of collection			1
' the council is prepared to spend a six figure sum fighting to kill a dog when they might lose in the @entity22 , ' barrister @entity118 , founder of the @entity119 told @entity124			1
' no dog should be allowed to be killed by a council expect by court order , ' mr @entity118 argued			0
in normal circumstances @entity12 's case would never have made it to the @entity22 but her fate has taken an unusual twist due to the manner in which the local council made in administrative decision for her to be put down			1
in a letter to the @entity24 council , the ceo of @entity99 sa @entity139 , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome @entity12 at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed			1
the letter , seen by @entity124 and written on september 9 , 2014 , said : ' as discussed late last week , i can confirm that @entity99 @entity38 would be happy to transport the dog known as @entity12 ( owned by @entity16 ) to our @entity146 here in @entity149 in order for her to undergo an extensive behavioural assessment under the guidance of our qualified behaviourists			2
' ' this would involve a wide variety of behavioural interactions and analysis both inside and outside kennels , in our indoor behavioural centre and our outdoor fenced enclosures			0
the purpose of this would be to determine , in as thorough a manner as possible , the rehabilitation prospects of this dog			0
' we are able to arrange collection and transport at no expense to @entity24			0
@entity99 @entity38 are prepared to take @entity12 into our care and custody and assume all liability for this dog from the time of collection			2
' in september 2013 , @entity12 's owner ms @entity16 pleaded guilty to charges of her dog causing ' serious injury ' at @entity179 but the local council , the @entity24 , did not apply for a destruction order on @entity12 from the magistrate at that time			1
if they had applied for the order from the magistrate , the question of whether the penalty ( death ) was proportionate to the injury caused ( a 1.5 centimetre cut ) would have been raised on appeal to a judge at the county court			2
instead , the council ruled that the dog should be destroyed during a council panel meeting			1
during the panel hearing , which took place on 30 september , 2013 , at @entity199 , one of the people on the panel was the same council officer who brought the charges against @entity12 's owner ms @entity16			2
the team of barristers fighting @entity12 's case from the @entity119 , including @entity41 and @entity208 , is now challenging the decision that the panel came to based on administrative law grounds			1
' the council officer who brought the charges then sat as a member of the three person panel which decided to put the dog down , ' mr @entity118 told @entity124			2
' the question of law is whether a fair minded observer might think that the accuser sitting on a panel is a ) a conflict of interest or b ) with a disposition of pre judgement			0
' @entity12 has been living in a cage at the @entity99 centre in @entity20 for more than 21 months while the legal battle has played out			0
@entity20 's highest court first upheld the decision to destroy her on september 10 , 2014 , but the barristers have now been granted @entity234 permission to appeal to the @entity235			2
mr @entity118 admitted : ' it 's a bit of a story			0
' ' only one in ten cases get through on special leave application			0
' in a letter to the @entity24 council , the ceo of @entity99 sa @entity139 , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome her at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed			1
but the council knocked back the offer			0
' rather than accept the offer and bring the matter to an end - avoiding legal proceedings at cost and removing her from their municipal boundaries of @entity24 - and not leaving a family heartbroken â€¦ the @entity24 refuses and now they have got to fight in the high court , ' mr @entity118 said			2

the @entity24 council made an ' administrative decision ' to kill @entity12
an appeal to save the dog has begun in @entity38 's @entity22 on tuesday
the @entity266 bit a woman in august 2012
she suffered a 1.5cm cut but it was *classed* as a ' serious injury '
@entity274 decided to destroy @entity12 during a council panel meeting
normally a magistrate decides whether a dog should be killed
the @entity119 are fighting her case at no cost
if they win the council will have to *pay* legal fees
@entity287 offered to take @entity12 and assess her for rehabilitation
