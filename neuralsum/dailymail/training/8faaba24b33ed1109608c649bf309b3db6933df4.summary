two @entity1 experts have lifted the lid on how to win at the popular board game - just in time for @entity4			1
the experts have revealed that if you fancy winning against your relatives , it 's best to make sure at least one of your seven letters is an @entity10 and words without vowels like brrr , grrl , pfft , and psst will also help you clinch you the title			1
according to @entity20 @entity1 expert @entity19 , there are at least 100 different ways players can win @entity24 , of course , is a female internet user , and psst a bid to get someone 's attention			1
pfft is an expression of discontent , and brrr a way to say you are cold			1
and euoi , a cry of @entity37 frenzy , is remembered by connosieurs using the phrase @entity40			0
@entity41 , a monetary unit in @entity43 , is given the mnemonic : @entity45 is always out			0
experts have also revealed that @entity48 words can be used as the game was invented in the @entity50 back in 1938			2
@entity20 @entity1 champion @entity19 even says there is a time and place for proper nouns - which are normally banned			1
his own first name , for example , is @entity58 slang for a blunder or mistake			0
@entity19 suggests the more words in a person 's vocabulary , the better , and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most in @entity1			0
for example : @entity66 - an epic poem psst - a word used to capture someone 's attention inconspicuously brrr - used to signify being cold @entity19 - another word for a blunder @entity73 - cry of @entity37 frenzy @entity75 - a variant spelling of the word khat , which is an evergreen shrub @entity41 - a monetary unit in @entity79 equally ' danny ' and plural ' dannies ' , is acceptable to describe a child 's hand			1
in his book , 101 ways to win at @entity1 , @entity19 explains that two - letter words may seem like a cheap way to bag a point , but they are in fact essential to move the game on			1
there are also 120 two letter words which serious @entity1 players learn off by heart			1
words like ax , ex , xi , and xu - using the eight - point ' x ' tile - are invaluable , he says			0
many dictionaries now have a page detailing all the accepted two - letter words , described as the ' glue ' of @entity1 including jo , es and ta			2
there are also a host of three - letter words , such as iff , roc , and ulu that can be useful			2
explaining the four - letter words without vowels - pfft , psst , grrl , and brrr - @entity19 makes clear that only these spelling are accepted and no extra fs , @entity116 or @entity117 can be added			1
to be the best , @entity19 advises knowing many words - but not necessarily the entire dictionary			0
it helps , he says , to know obscure ones like epopoeia , an epic poem , pshcent , an ancient @entity124 crown , and ttchick , a clicking sound			1
@entity127 , a finalist in this year 's @entity128 , says most amateur players ruin their chances by creating unnecessary tactics			2
' do n't avoid playing your best move because you are worried about what your opponent might be able to score off of it , ' @entity127 said			0
words like ' euoi ' , ' jiao ' , ' brrr ' , and ' grrl ' are essential , alongside ' epopoeia ' and proper nouns including ' @entity19 ' ' if you are scoring well and paying attention to the balance of letters left on your rack then it will serve you well not to be too defensive			1
' @entity19 said : ' there are all sorts of tricks that can help players impress their families when the @entity1 board comes out at @entity4			2
' one of the best things is known as a @entity155 - a three - letter extension on the front of a five - letter word so @entity158 becomes @entity159 and @entity160 becomes @entity161			2
' ultimately , @entity19 claims that sometimes tiles need to be swapped , which means that player misses a go , but they may get a better selection of letters and a higher score as a result			0
another key thing to remember is that the letter ' q ' does n't always need to be followed by a ' @entity171 '			1
in the two - letter list the word @entity173 is ' a variant of chi '			2
@entity177 : finalist @entity178 said most amateur players ruin their chances by tactically saving their words while @entity182 ( a variant spelling of the word khat ; an evergreen shrub ) , @entity186 ( a @entity188 chief ) and sheqalim ( the plural of sheqel , the currency of @entity192 ) are examples of longer words where this technique can be used			0
another way to steal points from the words already placed on the board by opponents , as listed in @entity19 's book , is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes			0
these included ' ed ' , ' ing ' and adding the letter s to the end of words , yet @entity19 adds the suffix ' ish ' is rare and equally effective , especially on words such as pixyish			0
though the letter 's ' and the blank tile are the best tiles to select , they should be used sparingly as there are only four , according to @entity19 's book			0
an s , for example , should only be used when adding it increases the overall score by around five points , otherwise it 's a ' waste ' .			0

pfft , @entity223 , @entity224 , and @entity24 are key to clinching the title , according to experts
champions use ' epopoeia ' , an epic poem , and ' *pschent* ' , an @entity124 crown
professional players also reveal you can use proper nouns in some cases
@entity218 is the best letter to pick from the bag but top players warn to use it wisely
