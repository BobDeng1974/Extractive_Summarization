in football terms , @entity0 has been on a bit of a losing streak with their coverage of the game			1
with the next year or so promising a rather pale mix of highlights shows and live @entity10 games , it 's certainly not the end of the world			1
but presumably as a result , it was recently announced that two of their most worthy assistants @entity21 and @entity22 would , in the language of these things , be ' parting company ' with the channel at the end of the season			1
now it has been announced that the gaffer has also gone			2
after nearly five years at the helm , we have been told that @entity31 has now left ' with immediate effect '			1
@entity33 has been quickly drafted in , certainly at least temporarily , to front their changing football coverage			1
were @entity0 thinking that , perhaps , the @entity36 may not go quite so gently into that good night ? @entity31 , who has been replaced as @entity0 's lead football host , pictured in west @entity38 on friday broadcaster @entity33 was named as @entity0 's new lead football presenter on friday @entity31 appeared in good spirits despite the news , as he walked near his home in west @entity38 not that you 're going to be asking your waiter ' did n't you used to be @entity31 ? ' any time soon			1
since launching his career working in the business news department at the @entity47 , he has been , and still remains , a broadcasting heavy hitter			2
even from those early days in that rather austere corner of telly , he was being seen as the kind of personality who could bring an ' everyman ' touch to his work			2
and , laudably , he was doing so with an accent and appearance that was n't straight off the @entity59 ’s production line			0
so when they decided that their new sunday night version of @entity63 would need to have a fresh approach to that of the saturday night flagship , they no doubt also knew they had just the man in the ranks to bring that approach			0
@entity31 had been there , bought the @entity73 season ticket			1
and so it was that @entity63 2 launched in 2004 with a man at the helm with no parting in his hair and an excitable , scattergun , sometimes frenzied editorial approach that was more like the caller on 606 than it was the cool , controlled anchor			0
what 's more , he also liked to find funny little crowd shots or cock ups and hit us with a one liner over them			0
just the kind of thing we do ourselves at home or down the pub. @entity31 , pictured as a young boy growing up in @entity93 in and out of sporting attire , has left @entity0 @entity31 came to prominence as the presenter of @entity47 's @entity98 show that was launched in 2004 during his time on the @entity47 , @entity31 also presented ' @entity100 ' which was first aired in 2007 @entity31 ( right ) formed a successful on - screen relationship with @entity102 during the weekday show in other words , @entity31 was never going to be another @entity105			1
not least because there will never be another @entity105			0
but also because @entity31 was his own man , a natural who also happened to have well - honed presenting skills			1
what you see is what you get			0
it was something that quickly then saw him also moving into prime time with the one show			0
the big - money deal was made in 2010 , which meant @entity31 was now moving from his quirky late night magazine football show into hours and hours of live broadcasting ( including , albeit briefly , a new breakfast show ) under the glaring spotlight of our most successful commercial station			1
and this is where the mood began to change			0
it was a bit like watching an excellent magician , who wowed you up - close with tricks at the dinner table , trying to become @entity133 on the @entity135 stage - but using the same old pack of cards with which to do so			2
the settings were now @entity141 venues , @entity142 and @entity143			0
@entity31 left @entity47 for @entity0 in 2010 and had worked there for almost five years prior to his departure @entity31 presented @entity0 's @entity141 coverage but the channel will not show live games next season thankfully , what @entity31 did n't try to do was change his personality to fit			1
that would have made him look like a fake , which i do n't see him as			0
but he did n't adjust his approach			0
this became particularly clear with his frequent launching of custard pies in the direction of , in particular , @entity159 and @entity160			0
these would often come back with interest			0
@entity31 was determined to maintain the sense that we were all just a bunch of pals watching the footy down the pub together			2
but it increasingly did n't seem to sit well			0
even his determination to keep his little zingers over funny pictures going from the @entity63 2 days began to feel forced , that he was trying too hard , being offbeat for offbeat 's sake			0
and yet there was still something left in the tank for last summer			2
from their fold - up chairs on the beach , and with their collection of knobbly knees on full display , i thought @entity0 's coverage of @entity187 really hit the right note			1
and @entity31 himself was just one knotted handkerchief on the head away from being that fella who had first left his seat at @entity194 10 years ago to make a bunch of old pros look at football through the fans ' eyes			1
it turns out that this would probably have been the ideal way for @entity31 to close that particular chapter of his broadcasting story			2
former @entity205 midfielder @entity160 ( centre ) left @entity0 prior to last summer 's @entity207 in @entity208 @entity31 sports shorts and flip flops while presenting @entity0 's live @entity207 coverage in @entity208 last summer @entity31 and pundits @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 ( @entity216 ) get soaked by a spinkler in @entity218			1
