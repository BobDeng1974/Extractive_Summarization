by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:20 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 04:13 est , 11 december 2012 @entity2 has called for a major rethink of plans to monitor people ’s phone records and internet use			1
the deputy prime minister ordered home secretary @entity9 ' back to the drawing board ' after a parliamentary committee expressed ‘ serious concerns ’ about the so - called snoopers ’ charter			2
mps and peers accused ministers of using ‘ fanciful and misleading ’ figures to back up its proposals to give police and security services sweeping powers to access communications data			1
coalition clash : @entity26 deputy pm @entity2 seized on ' serious criticisms ' by mps and peers to insist @entity29 home secretary @entity9 may rethink her plans to monitor phone and internet use they said the proposed laws , which would force internet and phone firms to store masses of information about emails , phone calls and internet clicks , go much further than is necessary and amount to overkill			1
mr @entity2 said that the ' serious criticisms ' meant the government ’s draft @entity43 must be ripped up			2
but mrs may insisted she will ' not allow these vitally important laws to be delayed any longer in this @entity48 '			2
the row triggered one of the most dramatic coalition splits since the controversial @entity52 was ' paused ' after @entity26 expressed grave doubts about its contents			2
mr @entity2 was delighted to find the joint committee of mps and peers agreed with his concerns about giving police and security services access to phone and internet records			1
the deputy pm said : ' their report makes a number of serious criticisms – not least on scope ; proportionality ; cost ; checks and balances ; and the need for much wider consultation			2
‘ it is for those reasons that i believe the @entity76 needs to have a fundamental rethink			2
‘ we can not proceed with this bill and we have to go back to the drawing board			2
’ has caused deep unease : officials will be able to see the address of every website visited , along with details of @entity87 phone calls and use of gaming websites mrs may insisted however that , while she would consider the report ’s findings , the government must forge ahead with the legislation in the current parliament			1
she reminded the @entity26 they had agreed to the inclusion of the law in the strategic defence review ( @entity99 ) of 2010			1
she said : ‘ this is a @entity76 commitment			2
it was put in the @entity99 because it was recognised this was so important to be able to continue to protect the @entity103 from a number of threats , including paedophiles and terrorists			2
’ today @entity108 , a junior @entity109 minister , conceded there was ' workn that needs to be done '			0
' there is a legitimate debate to be had over the balance between security and individual liberty , ' he told @entity118 's today programme			1
there is a gap in what the police is able to do at the moment			1
we believe that the changes that meet the substance of [ the report 's ] recommendations can be made in reasonably short order , but we know that we need to work this through with the coalition , recognising that the deputy prime minister has set out his concerns			0
' there are always differences in the coalition , that ’s what coalition is all about			0
this is about saving lives and protecting the public			0
' under the plan , internet and phone companies will be compelled by law to store the information for a year			1
it can then be accessed on a case - by - case basis in relation to terrorist cases or ‘ serious crime ’			0
@entity26 home affairs spokesman @entity151 warned : ' it is very , very dangerous once you start collecting huge amounts of data on literally everybody on the country ... that is incredibly dangerous			1
' mr @entity151 said many people would be ' uncomfortable ' that websites they visited , such as for abortion providers or marriage counsellors , were logged			1
he also expressed concerns that the location a text was sent from could be stored			0
officials will be able to see the address of every website visited , along with details of @entity87 phone calls and use of gaming websites			1
they point out they only want to be able to find out when a call was made and to whom – not what was said			0
the idea has caused deep unease among backbench @entity26 and @entity29 mps , prompting mr @entity2 to demand an inquiry by the joint parliamentary committee			2
yesterday , the @entity178 and peers broadly accepted the case for some further powers to monitor higher levels of communications data			1
but , in a highly critical report , they called for the draft bill to be substantially rewritten			0
they said mrs may would be given ‘ sweeping powers to issue secret notices ’ ordering communications companies to disclose ‘ potentially limitless ’ categories of data			1
the report found the @entity76 had exaggerated the financial benefits of the £ 1.8billion proposal			0
@entity199 ’s intelligence and security committee , which monitors the work of the security services , said that without the new powers there would be a ‘ serious impact ’ on the work of @entity206 and @entity207			1
but @entity29 mp @entity208 said : ‘ this report casts doubt on the security case for such sweeping surveillance powers			2
’ and @entity212 , director of policy for the campaign group @entity214 , said : ‘ the government has been sent back to the drawing board by this cross-party committee			0
‘ it is clear that a proper public consultation would leave this snoopers ’ charter , not just in the long grass , but dead and buried			0
’ @entity26 mp @entity151 , who sat on the committee , said the bill was ‘ far too broad , very expensive , poorly evidenced and potentially unworkable ’			0
analysis by @entity0 politicians have been trying to pass new snooping laws for the past four years amid ferocious opposition from civil liberties groups			0
@entity229 , the authoritarian @entity230 home secretary , failed in 2008 in a bid to introduce a massive database containing details of every internet visit , phone call and email			1
the @entity29 and @entity26 , who opposed the @entity229 blueprint , then revived the idea two years later			0
it was included in the government ’s strategic defence review ( though not the @entity76 agreement )			0
@entity9 argues there are crucial differences between the @entity230 plan and her own			2
the most important distinction is that the internet and phone companies will keep the data – not a state database which could be abused or hacked			1
however , the joint committee of mps and peers says the home secretary ’s proposal is very similar to the @entity229 proposal			1
her bill would force communications providers to keep databases of emails , phone calls and other data for 12 months			1
each database could then be accessed round the clock by the government ’s request filter , a computer system available to police and security officials			1
the mps and peers say : ‘ so the same data is being stored about the same people and it is being stored in databases which are accessible to public authorities given powers under the bill			1
‘ the difference is that instead of one database there are many and they are privately owned			0
difficult position deciding what to next : shadow home secretary @entity284 issued a lengthy statement which failed to say whether the opposition would back or oppose the bill although they are privately owned the government can stipulate what should be held on them , for how long , and in what format it should be supplied			0
‘ the differences therefore are not as great as the @entity109 suggests ; the request filter can be equated to a federated database			0
’ to give an example of the scope of these powers , the report says it would be possible for the authorities to use the filter to ‘ list all persons who are the designated user of a mobile phone that was in @entity306 ( eg @entity307 ) at time ( eg noon last tuesday ) ’			1
when deciding how much they want the draft bill to be amended , @entity178 will doubtless have the request filter in their sights			0
but both the @entity26 and @entity230 are in a difficult position when deciding what steps to take next			0
last night , shadow home secretary @entity284 issued a lengthy statement which failed to say whether the opposition would back or oppose the bill			0
their problem is that they have supported an even tougher version of the legislation in government so would appear opportunistic if they voted against now			0
mr @entity2 , meanwhile , is confronted by the fact that the joint committee – while scathing over the detail of the draft bill – accepted the principle that some new snooping powers are needed			0
he is likely to demand significant concessions , while stopping short of demands from his party to ditch the bill			0
the legislation does not have implications for the @entity334 , which covers personal information which police can hold about a person			1
communications data is currently governed by the @entity339 , which would be updated by the draft bill .			1

mps and peers accuse ministers of using ' misleading ' figures in bid to give police and security services access to communications data
under the plan , officials will be able to see the address of every website visited , details of @entity87 phone calls and use of gaming websites
internet and phone companies will be compelled by law to store information for a year
