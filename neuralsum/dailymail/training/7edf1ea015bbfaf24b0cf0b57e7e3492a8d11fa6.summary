the royal was at the @entity38 meeting young farmers and inspecting livestock when he met the @entity14 bull
grinning nervously , the prince stayed a safe distance from the animal but later plucked up the *courage* to pet a *cow*
earlier , the royal took part in a *kickabout* with *schoolchildren* during a visit to a coaching session in @entity72
took his coaching duties seriously and used his body to completely block the tiny goal so no one scored a penalty
despite his antics , the children described him as a ' funny ' guy who ' kept making lots of jokes '
