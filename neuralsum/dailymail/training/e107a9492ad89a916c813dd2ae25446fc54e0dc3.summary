the owner of an @entity2 restaurant has been accused of racism and bigotry for refusing to serve customers who are gay , from ethnic minorities , with disabilities , or without jobs			1
@entity9 did n't do much to dispel the allegation when he gave an interview to a local news station from his restaurant in @entity14 , called @entity9 's @entity15			1
' i ’ve been in business 44 years , i think i can spot a freak or a f * * * * * , ' he told @entity20			1
outdated : @entity9 ideas about who can and can not dine in his establishment have been met with disgust following an interview he did on local tv former customer : @entity28 says @entity9 would not allow him into @entity9 's @entity15 because he 's in a wheelchair local man and former longtime customer @entity28 says @entity9 has banned him from his restaurant because of his wheelchair			1
@entity9 denies that the problem is @entity28 's disability			2
' he created an issue			0
you only have one time here			0
you create an issue , you 're out forever , ' he told @entity20			0
@entity28 claims that ’s just ' a weak excuse , ' and that @entity9 ’ was denied entry because he is disabled and uses a wheelchair			1
@entity28 , it must be noted , turned a blind eye to @entity9 ' apparent discriminatory practices when he was basking in the restaurant owner 's approval , but now says @entity9 ' intolerance is unacceptable			1
' he does n’t like certain people of race , color , ethnicity , ' @entity28 said of @entity9			2
surrounds : an outside view of @entity9 's @entity15 , the interior of which is decorated with @entity57 flags and other @entity59 paraphernalia @entity9 interview with @entity20 's reporter , who is of @entity63 descent , seemed to confirm @entity28 's allegations			1
when asked if he would refer to her using the racial slur ' chink , ' @entity9 replied that he would n't			2
well , not unless ' we were drinking and joking around or something , ' he said			0
' if i reached over there and slapped the s * * * out of you , you should be offended			0
but to call someone a " chink " or someone call me a bigot , that does n’t bother me , why should it bother you ? ' @entity9 proudly wears his restaurant 's t - shirt , which spells out the small - town business - owner 's creed			1
the restaurant ’s official t - shirt makes it clear that a ' faggot ' is n’t welcome in @entity9 ’s establishment			1
it also calls the place a n * * * * * - free - zone , and threatens violence against @entity92 , @entity93 , and members of many minority groups			2
' i really do n’t want gays around			0
any man that would compromise his own body would compromise anything , ' @entity9 told @entity20			0
hate on a plate : @entity9 wearing his offensive t - shirt that is emblazoned with discriminatory words against black people , @entity92 , democrats , women and gays after his latest press coverage , not even ' great whites ' seem keen on patronizing @entity9 's @entity15 he is also not willing to serve anyone on welfare , a circumstance many believe he himself may now end up in after his comments			1
a facebook page that sprung up in the wake of his interview designates @entity9 's @entity15 as a gay bar			1
it 's been given 1.5 stars out of five by 885 reviewers , many of whom note instances of discrimination			0
the restaurant 's @entity126 page is equally complimentary			0
@entity14 , a city of almost 50,000 in @entity2 with a largely white population , is a predominantly @entity131 stronghold			0
