' @entity3 are like a lot of @entity2 clubs , they have signed quite a few foreign players and are technically quite good			2
i think it 's good for @entity64 and @entity65 players to go away sometimes and experience new things			0
' i was 24 when i left @entity67 to come here and i do n't regret it at all , the only time things went sour came in the last few weeks when i was told to train with the youth team because i did n't want to sign a new contract			0

@entity44 played with two of @entity3 's players at @entity45 – @entity99 striker @entity98 and goalkeeper @entity100			1
