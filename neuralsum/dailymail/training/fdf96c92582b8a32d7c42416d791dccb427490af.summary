one precinct has even been told that time off is not permitted until police up their arrests and summonses , reports the @entity10			1
' everyone here is under orders â€” no time off ' during the summons catch - up blitz , said one cop at the @entity17 in @entity18			1
' but now they 're realizing how much revenue the city is losing and they 're enforcing their will upon us , ' he said			0
the officer told the newspaper that they were informed they could not return to the precinct or even take a meal break until two summonses were logged			1
a source told the newspaper that across @entity46 precincts are being ordered to give borough commanders ' activity sheets ' indicating the number of arrests and summonses per shift			1
' police officers around the city are now threatened with transfers , no vacation time and sick time unless they write summonses , ' one union source told the newspaper			1

' ' slowdown ' : @entity1 commissioner @entity67 has admitted that his officers started making fewer arrests after two cops were executed in revenge for the death of @entity73 a memo posted on the wall at a station house in @entity18 , informs officers that new vacation days will not be approved beyond already approved vacation days and that a doctor 's note will be needed for sick days			1
on friday police commissioner @entity67 announced that so many police officers had stopped writing tickets and making low - level arrests in the weeks since two officers were fatally shot that the number of summonses plummeted 90 percent			1
but @entity67 said the problem at the nation 's police largest department is on the mend and the numbers are already going back up			1
' i would describe it as a slowdown , ' @entity67 said			0
' they never stopped working , 911 calls were responded to , arrests continued to be made , crime continued to go down			2
' numbers for low - level arrests like fare beating in the subway and public drunkenness were down by half and summonses for criminal activity were down more than 90 percent after the dec. 20 shooting deaths of officers @entity109 and @entity111 in their patrol car			1
the officers were targeted by a mentally unstable man who vowed online to kill two ' pigs ' in retaliation for the deaths of black men and boys at the hands of police around the country			2
the shootings caused a growing rancor between the rank and file and mayor @entity127 to boil over , as dozens of officers turned their backs on him at the hospital , and then thousands did at the funerals for the officers			0
there had been chatter of a deliberate slowdown because of the startling change in police statistics but @entity67 did not confirm it until friday , after he had taken a comprehensive look			2
he said he did n't know the cause of the slowdown , but he has said he realizes morale among some officers is low			0
@entity143 , president of the police @entity144 , denied the drop in arrests was deliberate			1
' police officers never stopped their daily job of putting themselves in harm 's way protecting @entity46 , ' @entity147 said in a statement			1
' this past month we experienced an unparalleled drain on our resources policing protesters gone wild and horrible tragedy in the assassination of our two brothers in blue			0
' @entity67 said he does n't believe the slowdown affected safety and noted crime remains at historic lows			0
no officers were facing discipline			0
' i do n't think it 's warranted , ' he said			0
' i 'm very mindful of the extraordinarily stressful situations that the officers in the city found themselves in last month			0
and so we 'll work to bring things back to normal			0
' one officer was suspended for insubordination during the period but it was n't directly related to the slowdown			0
@entity67 said no police union gave any official instruction to slow police action			2
he met this week with the union leaders , and with borough chiefs to discuss the issue			2
' to encourage them to get out to the roll calls and start encouraging officers , now that we 're out of the funerals and demonstrations , to get back to normal activity , ' he said			2
the low enforcement activity prompted some to question @entity67 's signature crime - fighting tool known as ' broken windows , ' where low - level offenses were targeted to prevent more serious crime			1
but @entity67 said friday it had no major impact			0
' the whole thesis of ' broken windows ' is if over time you do n't address an issue , over time it will create a larger issue , ' he said .			0
