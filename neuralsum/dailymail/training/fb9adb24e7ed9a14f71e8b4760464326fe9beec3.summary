however , he was told that the leg would be the property of the hospital that removed it			0
as he told @entity1 publication @entity36 : ' my leg is my property			0
people keep their kidney stones in a jar on the mantelpieces			0
ashes of deceased people are included in tattoos			0
' i ’m going to make a lamp of my leg			0
' mirror image : mr @entity7 places his left foot beside his amputated right foot which is now in the lamp crutches : mr @entity7 is using crutches as he tries to accumulate enough money for a prosthetic leg the hospital finally agreed to allow mr @entity7 to keep his leg after it was removed , and it was then he moved forward with his idea to raise funds for a prosthesis			1
