it has already had more than seven million views worldwide			0
the little @entity18 actresses turn the air blue with their language , while also pointing out several shocking statistics on pay inequality , rape and violence and body issues			1
each line of dialogue is expressed by a different girl , who are all dressed as @entity41 - style princesses , as they try to turn the “ princess in distress ” stereotype on its head			2
the video opens as it aims to go on - with a swear word seven seconds in			2
the @entity49 has bleeped out any of the words but has kept the rest of the video intact			0
the girls say : ' pretty , pretty , what the f * * * ? i ’m not the pretty f * * * ing hopeless princess in distress ' i ’m pretty f * * * ing powerful and ready for success			1
' what is more offensive - a little girl saying f * * * or the f * * * ing unequal and sexist way society treats girls and women ? ' they continue : ' it ’s our future , so listen up grown - ups			1
' here ’s some words more offensive than the word f * * *			2
' the first issue that the girls tackle is pay inequality , stating several eye - opening statistics about how unequal it is for women in the workplace			1
the girls say : ' women are paid 22 per cent less than men for the exact same f * * * ing work			1
' and women who graduate university with straight a ’s get paid as much as men who only got @entity91 ’s			0
' so bad grades equal more bank , just because you ’re a boy ? ' hell no mother f * * * er. i should n’t need a penis to get paid			2
' the girls in the video ask which is more offensive - the fact that they are swearing , or the inequality facts that they are presenting you with they then move on to the topic of rape and violence against women and girls , opening with the figure : ' one out of every five women will be sexually assaulted or raped by a man			1
' the girls then count that there are five of them in the video and ask , ' which one of us will it be ? ' they continue : ' so how many more women have to get knocked down before society stands up and stops it ? ' stop telling girls how to dress and start telling boys not to f * * * ing rape			1
' @entity125 ’s next step is walking to the car without fear			0
' the girls then finish on the issue of looks and ' prettiness			0
' they say : ' here ’s the tricky thing , ' pretty ' is a compliment , but here ’s how this focus works to girls ’ detriment			0
the girls address a range of issues including pay inequality , rape , violence and body issues ' society teaching girls that our bodies , boobs and butts are more important than our brains , leads us to thinking that our worth comes from our waistline			1
' my ass - pirations in life should not be worrying about the shape of my ass			0
' so f * * * focusing on how i look and give me a book			2
' the video 's producer @entity161 acknowledges that some adults might be uncomfortable with what they see in the video , but insists that it is for a good cause			0
he said : ' it is shocking what they are saying , but the real shock is that women are still paid less than men for the same work in 2014 , not the use of the f - word			0
' each line of dialogue is expressed by a different girl , who are all dressed as @entity41 - style princesses , as they try to turn the “ princess in distress ” stereotype on its head the girls are given witty but shocking one - liners that include : ' f * * * focusing on how i look and give me a book ' @entity161 continued : ' the big statistic that one out of five women are sexually assaulted or raped is something society seems to find less offensive than a little four letter word and we love how these girls draw attention to that imbalance			1
' he added : ' instead of washing these girls ’ mouths out with soap , maybe society needs to clean up its act			0
' the video is part of the @entity18 @entity211 t - shirt company ’s charity t - shirt fundraising effort			2
