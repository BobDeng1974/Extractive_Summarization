an incredulous @entity1 mother was banned from @entity2 for 24 - hours after the social media giant labeled a picture she uploaded of her two - year - old daughter , ' pornographic '			1
photographer , @entity7 said that she fell foul of @entity2 's notoriously strict guidelines on posting nude children after they received a complaint about her innocent recreation of the famous ' @entity15 girl ' pose from the 1950s ad campaign			1
mrs @entity7 's profile was suspended from the site for a day after she ignored a request to remove an unedited version of the photo that shows daughter @entity23 's bathing suit being pulled down on july 3			1
she replaced that picture with a version that has a smiley face ' emoji ' over her backside instead , but that too was reported , but @entity2 has said that this picture meets their terms and conditions			2
offending picture : this is the photographer that @entity7 is facing a lifetime ban from @entity2 for			1
her daughter @entity35 , ( right ) has her bathing suit bottoms in the image which received complaints on the social media giant the original @entity41 advertisement showed a little girl 's swimming costume being pulled down by a small dog , to expose her backside and mrs @entity7 said she was at the beach recently near her @entity47 home when she decided to recreate it			1
' i posted the photo on @entity41 's @entity2 , ' @entity7 told @entity51			1
' we thought it would be cute because of the old @entity41 ad and her tan line looked like that			0
' however , someone reported the picture to @entity2 because they found the image of the little girl 's bare backside offensive			2
responding , @entity2 sent her a notice asking her to either delete the picture , change her privacy settings so that the picture was not public or to ignore			2
daughter and mother : @entity23 , ( left ) is inadvertently at the center of a storm created by @entity2 and their terms of use after they effectively accused her mother , @entity35 , ( right ) of posting child pornography family : jill with her husband and son and daughter @entity23			1
the @entity1 photographer is facing a lifetime ban from @entity2 after being accused of posting child pornography innocent : @entity23 standing on the beach with her friend in another picture taken by @entity7 that day ' well i ignored it , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
' no way did i think it would fit the criteria of nudity or pornography and if you read the terms of use in settings no where does it state that this would be considered either			0
' @entity2 disagreed with this and banned @entity7 from the site for 24 hours			1
this is because according to their terms and conditions which all members sign up to , the social media giant can ' remove content that violates our statement of rights and responsibilities			0
' if we determine you 've posted something that violates our terms , you may receive a warning or become disabled , depending on how severe the violation is			0
' @entity7 told @entity51 that she could not post the picture to her personal profile nor the fan page she had created for her photography firm			2

these policies are designed to ensure @entity2 remains a safe , secure and trusted environment for everyone on @entity2 , ' said a @entity2 spokesman to @entity130			0
report : this is the message that @entity35 received from @entity2 on july 3 that show that the picture was reported for pornography recreation : @entity7 said that she was trying to pay homage to this famous advertisement for the @entity41 girl indeed , when her ban was lifted she altered the picture slightly to reflect sensitivities and reposted this new image			1
' i got back on with another photo , this time a big @entity147 face on the area of the butt crack , ' she said			0
' now it is being reviewed again for nudity and pornography			0
' @entity2 have said that they have examined this photograph and find it meets their terms and conditions			2
' @entity2 has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved , ' the @entity163 state			0
