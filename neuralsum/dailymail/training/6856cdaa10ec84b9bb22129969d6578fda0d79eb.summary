@entity0 put aside their dismal showing at the @entity3 in @entity4 to cruise to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity7 at the @entity8 in @entity9 on thursday			1
the @entity0 were knocked out of the @entity3 at the group stage with just three points but goals from @entity13 and @entity14 inside the first 10 minutes of this encounter gave @entity16 a comfortable victory in his first match in charge			1
@entity21 oversaw his first @entity7 match since 1998 but he will not have been impressed with what he witnessed			1
@entity24 was dismissed after just nine minutes to allow @entity14 to net from the spot and double @entity0 's advantage , and @entity7 simply did not recover			1

sending off : @entity91 ( 9 )			0
the departure of @entity113 , who inspired @entity7 to a semi-final in @entity4 , to @entity115 also saw the removal of the in vogue 3 - 5 - 2 formation for the @entity119 , who instead opted for a more fluid 4 - 3 - 3			1
@entity121 was joined in the starting line - up by new @entity115 team - mate @entity123 , who signed for £ 14million from @entity124 on transfer deadline day , as well as @entity127 full - back @entity89 and former @entity128 forward @entity97			2
@entity131 star @entity130 was deemed unfit and did not even find himself on the bench			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , rested @entity133 legend @entity76 and instead started with @entity134 in goal			0
@entity137 forward @entity13 and debutant @entity139 were chosen to lead the line in @entity142 's absence - the £ 16m @entity128 striker was suspended for the match			2
and it was the home side who dominated the match from the off , with @entity13 streaming through after just three minutes to open his account for @entity0			1
after receiving a long ball through the middle , @entity13 ran past @entity152 and @entity91 before rounding @entity7 ' keeper @entity88 and stroked the ball home			2
but it would only get worse for the @entity119 as seven minutes later they found themselves with a two - goal deficit and a man down			0
@entity45 displayed his raw power to rush in behind @entity91 and force the defender to drag him down inside the box			0
@entity91 was the last man and had to go - and @entity21 could only watch from the bench as @entity0 captain @entity14 stepped up and slotted the ball into the bottom corner from the spot			1
the rest of the first half continued in much the same vein , with @entity0 missing guilt - edged chances through @entity71 and @entity45			2
@entity7 did improve marginally in the second half although , in truth , they could hardly have performed much worse			0
embrace : @entity13 ( centre ) is hugged by his team - mates after the striker opened the scoring for @entity0 just three minutes into the clash with @entity7 on thursday tackle : @entity7 midfielder @entity180 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity0 's @entity68 , leading to a booking for the @entity0 star at the @entity8 in @entity9 off target : @entity121 ( left ) missed some key opportunities for @entity7 as they lost the first match of the @entity188 era on thursday against @entity0 familiar face : @entity115 's new £ 14million signing from @entity191 ( left ) looks on as @entity0 's @entity45 ( right ) controls the ball during thursday 's friendly looking on : @entity127 and @entity7 right - back @entity89 ( left ) , @entity24 ( centre ) and @entity0 forward @entity13 run towards the ball on thursday all together now : the @entity0 starting line - up poses for a photograph before kick - off , with @entity134 ( right ) chosen ahead of @entity76 in goal for the @entity0 their best chance came when @entity0 defender @entity62 could only clear a @entity97 cross straight to @entity123 , whose cushion header gave @entity98 a chance to score but he smashed his left - foot volley harmlessly past the post			1
aside from a couple of @entity98 misses , there was little for the @entity119 to be proud about			0
they were simply outclassed from the very first minute to the last			0
@entity0 's main threat all night had been the pace of @entity45 and immobile up front , but @entity63 almost stole the headlines with a thunderbolt from 35 yards which forced @entity88 into a nervy parry			1
@entity27 can be pleased with his first match in charge			2
hiddink on the other hand has a lot of thinking to do			0
frustration : @entity7 midfielder @entity96 ( left ) claps his hands together , visibly annoyed , after he gives the ball away against @entity0 at the @entity8 in @entity9 deputising : @entity225 goalkeeper @entity134 ( pictured ) was chosen ahead of @entity0 and @entity133 legend @entity76 for the match on thursday opportunity : @entity70 ( left ) struggles to get into the @entity229 team at times but @entity231 elected to start the midfielder in his first match in charge competitive : former @entity128 striker @entity97 ( centre ) evades the challenge of @entity0 's @entity238 ( right ) during the match at the @entity8 on thursday acknowledgement : @entity0 coach @entity27 waves to the crowd before the start of his first match in charge of the national side against @entity7 on thursday evening			1

@entity13 opened scoring after just three minutes for home side after he rounded the goalkeeper and slotted home
@entity14 ( 10 ) doubled @entity0 's advantage from spot after @entity24 sent off for a foul on @entity45

@entity21 's first match back in charge and @entity7 's first since @entity113 left for @entity115
