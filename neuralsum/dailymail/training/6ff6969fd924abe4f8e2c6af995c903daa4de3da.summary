it may cover a staggering 656,650 square miles , but the @entity2 's vast expanse is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than previously thought			2
researchers have developed a model revealing that despite the sheet 's size and stability , the surface beneath it makes it more sensitive to movement			1
this movement causes different parts of the ice to move at different speeds , causing ice to shear - a phenomenon known as ice flow			1
this ultimately releases more ice into the ocean , adding to the rising sea levels			0
researchers have developed a climatic model which reveals that , despite the @entity28 's ( pictured ) size and stability , the weak sediment on the surface beneath it makes the sheet more sensitive to movement , caused by rising global temperatures			1
this increases the amount of ice released into the oceans the model was designed by researchers at @entity40			1
as well as assessing the impact increasing meltwater has on ocean levels each year , the model also took into account the role that the soft , spongy ground beneath the ice sheet plays in its changing dynamics			1
the @entity2 - the second - largest in the world , covering an area roughly eight times the size of the @entity52 - contains enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 23ft ( 7 metres ) if it were to be lost altogether			1
using a 3d ice sheet model , together with an observational record of surface melting , researchers from @entity40 were able to accurately reproduce how the ice sheet ’s seasonal movement changes in response to the amount of surface meltwater being delivered to the ground below			1
not only is the ice sheet sensitive to a changing climate , but extreme meteorological events , such as heavy rainfall and heatwaves , can also have a large effect on the rate of ice loss			0
the soft sediment beneath the sheet gets weaker as it tries to soak up more water , making it less resistant , so that the ice above moves faster			1
as a result , the researchers state that the @entity2 is not nearly as stable as first thought			2
currently , due to surface melting alone , it is losing ice at a net annual rate of 200 gigatonnes , equating to 0.02 inches ( 0.6mm ) of sea level rise			0
by comparison , sea levels globally are rising at 0.18 inches ( 3mm ) annually			0
a similarly large , but ultimately more uncertain source of sea level rise , has been blamed on the movement of this ice sheet			2
these shifts additionally cause ice to be discharged into the ocean , and these movements are caused by rising temperatures			0
study leader dr @entity97 , of @entity40 ’s @entity98 , said : ‘ when these large ice sheets melt , whether that ’s due to seasonal change or a warming climate , they do n’t melt like an ice cube			2
‘ instead , there are two sources of net ice loss : melting on the surface and increased flow of the ice itself , and there is a connection between these two mechanisms which we do n’t fully understand and is n’t taken into account by standard ice sheet models			2
’ other models of the @entity2 have typically assumed the ice slides over hard and impermeable bedrock			1
the model was designed by researchers at @entity40			2
as well as assessing the impact increasing meltwater has on ocean levels each year , the model also took into account the role that the soft , spongy ground beneath the ice sheet ( pictured above left and below right ) plays in its changing dynamics using a 3d ice sheet model , together with an observational record of surface melting , researchers were able to accurately reproduce how the ice sheet ’s seasonal movement changes in response to the amount of surface meltwater being delivered to the ground below this latest study incorporates new evidence from ground - based surveys , which revealed soft and porous sediments at the bed of the ice sheet - similar to the soft and muddy bottom of a lake			1
the study , published in the journal @entity151 , specifically identifies the intake and temporary storage of water by weak sediment beneath the ice sheet as a crucial process in governing ice flow			1
using a 3d ice sheet model , together with an observational record of surface melting produced by colleagues at @entity165 , dr @entity97 and dr @entity160 were able to accurately reproduce how the ice sheet ’s seasonal movement changes in response to the amount of surface meltwater being delivered to the ground below			1
last week , canyons , lakes and mountains were revealed in the most detailed maps ever made of the hidden world beneath the polar @entity175 of the @entity176 and @entity177 revealed features buried under the ice including a ‘ mega canyon ’ in @entity2 ( illustrated ) - bigger even than the @entity181 in the @entity182 dr @entity160 said : ‘ not only is the ice sheet sensitive to a changing climate , but extreme meteorological events , such as heavy rainfall and heatwaves , can also have a large effect on the rate of ice loss			1
global warming could be triggering increasingly cold winters in some parts of the world , scientists have claimed			0
they discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures , and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex			0
researchers led by @entity202 from @entity203 found that as oceans heat up and melt the @entity177 ice , warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere			0
the polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the @entity182 last winter , they continued			0

’ last week , canyons , lakes and mountains were revealed in the most detailed maps ever made of the hidden world beneath the polar regions			0
surveys of the @entity176 and @entity177 revealed features buried under the ice including a ‘ mega canyon ’ in @entity2 - bigger even than the @entity181 in the @entity182			1
and data from surveys of the regions has revealed the extent to which @entity177 sea ice is gradually decreasing and how long it might take to disappear			0
the unseen land under the ice was detailed in the new edition of the @entity234			0
while previous maps of the polar regions showed them as mostly near - blank whiteness , the latest data has allowed the appearance of the land under the ice to be revealed			0
and the maps show the dramatic decline in @entity177 sea ice in recent decades as the region is affected by rising global temperatures			0

the model was created by researchers at @entity40
it assessed the impact of increasing levels of annual meltwater
the model also took into account the soft , spongy ground beneath the sheet
previous research has typically assumed ice slides over hard bedrock
but , ground - based surveys have more recently identified a more porous sediment beneath the @entity2
this weak sediment leads to greater movement , which increases ice flow
