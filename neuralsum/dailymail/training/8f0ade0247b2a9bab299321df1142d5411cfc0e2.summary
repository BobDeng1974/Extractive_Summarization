by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 04:08 est , 19 june 2012 in the super-computing league table , the @entity1 has reclaimed ' top spot ' from @entity4			1
@entity7 's @entity6 computer , which is 1.55 times faster than @entity4 's previous record - breaker , the @entity9 , was installed and switched on at the @entity1 @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12			1
throwing evidence behind @entity14 - which dictates that computers get twice as powerful and twice as small every 18 months - the new super-computer is a powerful machine			2
it can perform - in less than a second - calculations which would take the super computers of 1993 three days to solve			0
in fact , the @entity7 team say it is 273,930 times more powerful than the 1993 machine - called the @entity23 and created by @entity1 firm thinking machines			1
the @entity6 : this grey slab is just part the most powerful computer on the planet , and will be used in nuclear power research , with perhaps a game or two of chess on the side the @entity33 reports that @entity6 is capable of calculating , in one hour , ' what otherwise would take 6.7 billion people using hand calculators 320 years			1
' the computer will be used carry out simulations to help extend the life of nuclear weapons , in a bid to avoid real - world underground tests @entity6 and uses over 1.5 million processors - to put that in perspective , your brand - new , luxurious £ 1,500 desktop pc will like be a quad - core , e.g. with four processors			1
gamers and computer enthusiasts all over the world will be very tempted to install some modern computer games like the first - person shooter @entity54 onto @entity6 to watch the hardware destroy all previous hardware benchmarks			1
@entity61 administrator @entity60 said : ' while @entity6 may be the fastest , the underlying computing capabilities it provides give us increased confidence in the nation 's nuclear deterrent			1
@entity4 's ' no 2 ' computer is certainly nothing to be sneered at			1
it packs 88,128 2.0 ghz 8 - core processors ( spread over 864 separate cabinets )			0
to put that in perspective , this is nearly 90,000 very - high - end home computers , all strung up together to work in sync			0
that creates around 705,000 processors in total , less than half of @entity6 's 1.5million , but still a mighty beast in its own right			1
it runs on @entity82 , the open - source and free alternative to @entity85 which means , if nothing else , @entity9 got to save some money on the software side			0
' @entity6 also represents continued @entity1 leadership in high performance computing			2
' it is also the machine with relatively outstanding economy power-wise , consuming 7.9 megawatts compared to the k computer , which consumes12.6 megawatts			2
other countries with supercomputers include @entity97 and @entity4 , with two apiece , and and @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 each have one			2
@entity7 has built five out of the top 10 computers			0
@entity102 , vice president of deep computing at the firm , told the @entity33 : ' substantial planning went into this			0
we knew the day would come			0
' not everyone was left excited by the new machine : @entity109 ’s @entity108 said : ' the @entity1 may claim home to some the world ’s top scientists , just as @entity97 has for two non-consecutive years claimed the world ’s fastest computer			2
... at the end of the day : supercomputers are just tools			0
' however , in reply , another @entity119 writer , @entity118 , said : ' on the other hand , @entity7 or any other supplier ’s ability to create such a complex , powerful computing research is of extreme importance			0
' the thought , the tools and the procedures needed to build and operate such a huge system are directly applicable to other types of computing			0

@entity7 's ' @entity6 ' beats @entity4 's ' k machine ' , running 1.55 times faster while being *15* per cent more *energy* *efficient*
computer - which is nearly *300,00* times faster than machines from 20 years *ago* - will be used for nuclear studies
