by @entity0 published : 19:08 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 16 october 2013 @entity1 yesterday signalled income tax cuts are being considered for the 5million workers due to be paying the 40 per cent rate by 2015			1
the @entity5 has taken millions of low - paid and part - time workers out of income tax altogether by increasing the personal allowance thresholds from £ 6,475 a year to £ 10,000 , at prime minister ’s questions , @entity10 mp @entity9 welcomed the moves to help basic rate taxpayers , but urged mr @entity1 to act to help those on the higher rate			1
speaking at @entity12 's questions , @entity1 said he wanted to ' see taxes cut for all ' he said the government needed to ‘ ease the squeeze on the middle classes ’			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ yes , i want to see taxes cut for all			2
’ the hike in personal allowance thresholds at the lower end means 2.7million people have been lifted out of paying any income tax at all since 2010			1
for the average taxpayer , it will amount to paying £ 705 less income tax compared to when the @entity5 took power			1
but at the other end , the numbers dragged into paying 40p income tax is expected to rise from 4.1million today to 4.9million in 2014			1
changes announced in the last budget mean that for most people the point at which they start to pay higher rate tax will be £ 41,865			0
it means one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn to the @entity44			0
in 1978 , only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate			2
in 1989 , the figure had barely moved to just five per cent			0
mp @entity9 has called on @entity1 to ' ease the squeeze on the middle classes ' normally , the 40 per cent higher - tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living			1
but from april 2014 , the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead			0
this lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in the 40 per cent net			0
‘ this means also someone on minimum wage working full time has seen their tax bill come down by something like two - thirds			0
’ at the @entity10 conference this month mr @entity1 said that a future @entity10 government would ‘ cut taxes for hard - working people ’ as the economy recovers			2
@entity75 , the chancellor , has ruled out borrowing more to fund tax cuts , meaning any further tax cuts are dependent on increased economic growth			0
there is increasing speculation that the @entity81 will go into the next election pledging to increase the income tax threshold further to £ 12,500 , bringing it broadly in line with the minimum wage			1
mr @entity9 pointed to a @entity87 briefing note accidentally released at the party ’s conference last month which suggested that there should be ‘ a further contribution ’ from ‘ those earning over £ 50,000 ’ , arguing that ‘ these are not the middle income earners ’			1
‘ it is true that , if you earn £ 50,000 , you are in the top ten per cent of earners , ’ mr @entity9 added			0
‘ but that takes no account of varying regional costs of living , especially in @entity102 , other cities and suburbs , or the @entity105 more generally			0
‘ it overlooks the fact that those earning £ 50,000 or more already pay 57 per cent of the income tax take , or that around two million extra middle income workers have already been sucked into paying the 40p rate of income tax in recent years			1
’ the mp said that a @entity87 ‘ tax assault ’ on the middle classes would ‘ go down like a lead balloon during an election ’			2
around 800,000 extra hard - working people have already been caught in the higher rate tax trap since @entity1 entered @entity119			2
official figures , from @entity121 , show there were just three million higher rate taxpayers when the coalition came to power in may 2010			0
an analysis by the @entity127 ’ @entity128 shows the starting salary for higher rate tax would currently be £ 63,777 , rather than £ 42,475 , if it had been ‘ uprated ’ each year by earnings , not inflation .			0
