by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 10 september 2013 angry : film blogger @entity1 called 911 when an audience member would not stop using his phone during a movie a film critic became so enraged at a fellow moviegoer using his cellphone during a screening yesterday that he called 911			1
@entity1 , a leading blogger who founded @entity9 , claims he was worried that a man who was using his phone non-stop for 10 minutes was trying to record the film			1
but some have accused him of wasting the police 's time by using the emergency number to report such a trivial matter			2
the incident occurred on monday during a screening of new thriller @entity20 during the @entity21			1
the screening was attended by film critics and industry workers , meaning that electronic devices were permitted to enable journalists to take notes			1
a member of the audience sitting in the front row of the cinema was apparently using his phone to send texts and emails throughout the opening of the movie , angering mr @entity1			1
after theatre staff told him they were powerless to intervene , the blogger dialled 911 to warn that the man could be pirating the film , which is due to be released in the @entity41 later this year			1
however , the emergency dispatcher simply laughed at him , while cinema employees suggested he should return for a public screening where phones are not allowed			0
mr @entity1 subsequently took to @entity46 to launch a furious tirade against the use of cellphones during movies			0
' i was afraid this would reach a head and this is it , ' he wrote			0
' they claim nothing can be done to " change the policy " in 2013 because it 's allowed			0
' defence : the blogger quoted @entity60 as he defended his over-the - top reaction to the etiquette breach while some other prominent film bloggers stood up for him , he also faced a backlash from people who suggested that he should not have involved the police in the matter			1
@entity69 tweeted : ' 911 is for emergencies , you embarrassingly unprofessional attention - starved stooge			2
' @entity74 added : ' dude , i agree they should n't be on their phones but 911 is for serious emergencies only			2
' mr @entity1 fiercely defended himself , writing : ' if it 's wrong to report potential piracy to authorities , then how will piracy ever be stopped			0
if it 's not taken seriously , it will remain			0
' film : mr @entity1 was attending a screening of @entity20 , whose creators are pictured here at the @entity87 film festival he later struck a more extravagant tone , quoting @entity60 to say : ' you can quote them , disagree with them , glorify or vilify them , but the only thing you ca n't do is ignore them because they change things			2
' the critic told @entity98 that he had not overreacted , and insisted he was highlighting a serious issue			0
' i thought i might be witnessing an act of piracy , a major crime being committed , and wished to report it to the proper authorities , ' he said			0
' the call made was to report an act of piracy in progress , a major crime that many signs around @entity21 remind people is a punishable offense			1
i simply requested that an officer confront and confirm that he was not pirating			0

founder of @entity9 was *watching* the *sacrament* in @entity21
