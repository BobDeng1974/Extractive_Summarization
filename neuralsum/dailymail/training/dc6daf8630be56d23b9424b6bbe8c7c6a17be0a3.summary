his first ' instructional video ' taught teenagers how to change an empty toilet roll in the bathroom - and went on to attract more than four million views			1
now ' distressed dad ' @entity6 has moved onto his next bone of contention : the dishwasher			1
and he 's fed up with something that most of us are guilty of , when we 've finished our dinner and eating the food seems to have taken that last bit of energy out of us			0
the offending items that mr @entity6 is going to show how can be dealt with it 's all tongue - in - cheek as @entity6 demonstrates how to put a plate into the dishwasher so much so , that the used cutlery and crockery is simply placed ' in the vicinity ' of the dishwasher instead of in it			1
in his latest tongue - in - cheek offering , mr @entity6 , from @entity25 , has some advice for his teenage children , @entity29 and @entity30 , on how to load the dishwasher			1
writing on his @entity33 page , he says : ' i honestly did n't think there would be another one as the first one was spontaneous and meant as a joke			0
a joke that seems to have struck a chord with quite a few people ! ! ' i have really enjoyed reading all your comments and suggestions and because of that , i decided to give it a go and see what you all think			0
' all i ask is please do n't take any of this too seriously			0
it is all just a bit of fun and who knows , maybe @entity29 and @entity30 may one day actually load the dishwasher or change the toilet roll ? ! ! @entity54 and i certainly hope so ! ! ' managing to keep a straight face as he explains his aims of the short film , mr @entity6 pans to some crockery and rubbish on the worktop , helpfully telling us that ' not all of this goes into the dishwasher			1
' @entity6 is hoping his video will strike a nerve with other parents who struggle to get their teenagers to tidy up the distressed dad shows the ' advanced level ' , which involves switching the dishwasher on take note , @entity29 and @entity30			1
' it 's really just the plates , and the knives and forks and spoons			0
there 's a few dirty things already in here already , ' he says as he opens the dishwasher door			2
' but that goes in there like that , you can put a plate in there like that			0
' the exasperated father then points to a bowl that ' needs to be rinsed out a bit ' as it has ' congealed ' after being left in one of his children 's bedrooms			2
' really that 's about all there is to it , ' adds mr @entity6 , before educating teens on the ' advanced level '			1
' put a dishwasher tab in here , and these buttons on top are like the buttons on your @entity106 or @entity108 that make it work , or effectively boot it up			2
give that a try and let me know how you get on , and thanks for watching			0
' helpfully , mr @entity6 points to where the ' tab ' goes so his children have no excuse in a message on his @entity33 page , mr @entity6 writes : ' i hope this raises a smile and maybe some knowing nods ' ' if it does , please share and let 's see what happens			2
' despite my kids saying that i 'm not funny and no one would be interested , i guess i have shown them that maybe dads do know a thing or two about the internet ! who would have thought ? ! ! ! '			0
