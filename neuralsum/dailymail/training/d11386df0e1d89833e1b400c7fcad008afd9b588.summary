watching your car being issued with a parking ticket is a frustration known to many of us			2
but few drivers will have reacted so dramatically as this man in @entity9 , east @entity10 , who was so incensed to see his car being put on a tow truck , he jumped behind the wheel and reversed straight off it			1
these astonishing pictures show the man , who , having returned to find his silver @entity17 being impounded , was determined to stop it going to the pound			2
it shows him rev the car 's engines and then , without looking behind him to see if the road was clear , reversing at full speed , landing on the road with a thud on the road in front of a group of giggling children			1
a spokesman for the council said the matter had been reported to police but neither the motorist nor the car had yet been found , as it appeared the car was not registered to the man who was driving it			2
a @entity60 spokesman said officers had been called to an altercation between a motorist and parking officials and said four officers had gone to the scene in @entity67 , @entity9			1
but they said that by the time police arrived , the motorist had driven off			0
the spokesman said efforts had been made to trace the motorist but police were no longer involved as it was considered to be a civil matter			0
this blurred image , taken from a parking official 's phone , shows the motorist jumping behind the wheel the astonishing incident took place in @entity67 , @entity9 , early one morning last month the car hits the ground with a loud thud after reversing off the back of the tow truck at high speed watched by a group of parking contractors and giggling schoolchildren , the motorist then reversed away going , going , gone : the motorist drove off and despite efforts by the council and police , remains at large @entity32 councillor @entity97 said : ' his actions are shocking			1
the man had an utter disregard for anyone on the street and what he did was extremely dangerous			0
' you can see kids and other members of the public milling around in the foreground of the video and thank goodness none of them were in the immediate vicinity or he could have killed someone			0
' a bystander said : ' there was an almighty crash as he dropped about three feet to the ground - i would think that whatever money he saved on the parkign ticket , he 'll have to pay to get his exhaust repaired			0
