disgraced @entity0 , 84 , has seen his honour annulled at the order of the @entity4 following his conviction for historic sex abuse @entity0 has finally been stripped of the cbe that was awarded to him by the @entity4			1
the move came eight months after the disgraced former children ’s entertainer was jailed for nearly six years for a string of attacks on girls as young as seven			1
the paedophile , 84 , had his honour annulled at the order of the @entity4 , days after being stripped of his @entity15 honours			1
officials at the @entity17 had been accused of dragging their feet over the issue , but sources insisted they had to follow established procedures before removing the gong			2
an announcement in the @entity24 yesterday stated : ‘ @entity4 has directed that the appointment of @entity0 to be a commander of the @entity27 , dated 17 june 2006 , shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the @entity30 of the said order			1
’ @entity33 mp @entity32 , who in january raised concerns in the @entity35 about why @entity0 still had a @entity1 , welcomed the news			1
he said : ‘ i am delighted to hear that @entity0 has been stripped of his cbe			1
it is simply unacceptable convicted sex offenders like @entity0 should be allowed to make a mockery of our honours system			1
’ when @entity0 , who was jailed in july last year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986 , was stripped of his @entity15 honours last week , there was widespread disbelief that he still held his coveted cbe in @entity47			1
it was awarded to him for services to entertainment and the arts , a year after he painted the @entity4 ’s 80th birthday portrait			1
a recommendation can be made by the @entity61 to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a criminal offence , and the final decision must be approved by the @entity4			1
@entity0 was first honoured in the late 1960s with an mbe , followed by an obe a decade later , and a cbe in 2006			1
during sentencing , mr @entity69 told him : ' your reputation lies in ruins			0
you have been stripped of your honours and you have no one to blame but yourself			2
' seven of the 12 counts related to the friend of @entity0 's daughter @entity78 , including one incident when she was 15 - years - old when he sexually assaulted her while @entity78 slept in the adjacent bed			1
during his trial , @entity0 was revealed as a ' @entity83 ' character who had a dark side to his personality and used his fame to ' mesmerise ' underage fans before abusing them with impunity			2
@entity89 said he ' committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law			0
' the entertainer 's conviction caused widespread revulsion in @entity98 and @entity47 , where his television programs were watched by millions of children			0
the decision by the @entity102 , published in the @entity24 today ( pictured ) , would have been approved by prime minister @entity103 and the @entity4 before being officially published all public traces of the entertainer have since been removed from his home town of @entity107 in @entity98 following his convictions , while a plaque outside his childhood home has been demolished			1
his artworks have also been removed from the council chambers , and his status as a freeman of the city has been revoked			0
@entity117 mp @entity32 , who wrote an acclaimed book on the @entity120 child sex scandal , was among those who campaigned for the removal of the @entity1			1
he has previously said : ' i find it difficult to understand why it has taken this committee so long			0
' a number of paedophiles , of which @entity0 is one , have held significant honours , including @entity130 and @entity120			1
they used their power and cloak of respectability to abuse children			0
' last week , mr @entity32 wrote to cabinet secretary @entity136 asking him for an update on plans to strip @entity0 of his cbe			1
he added : ' they have come close to bringing the whole honours system into disrepute , and you would have their honours would have been removed more quickly			0
' the @entity15 acted more quickly against @entity0 than we did			1
' @entity0 , whose fortune is estimated at £ 11 million was the second person to be convicted under a wide - ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late @entity130 , a fellow @entity151 star , was a prolific abuser			2
the former children 's entertainer joins the likes of dictators @entity156 and @entity158 and disgraced ex- banker @entity159 ' the @entity160 in being stripped of their titles			2
in january 2012 , mr @entity162 had his knighthood revoked after he was accused of contributing to the financial crash through his mismanagement of the @entity166			0
honours are usually only removed from people convicted and jailed , but the @entity17 said the scale of the @entity166 disaster - which had to be bailed out to the tune of £ 45billion by the taxpayer - made the case ' exceptional '			2
@entity0 was awarded the @entity1 in 2006 , a year after he painted the @entity4 's 80th birthday portrait ( pictured ) in 2008 , mr @entity156 was stripped of his honorary knighthood over his ' abuse of human rights ' and ' abject disregard ' for democracy , the @entity174 said			1
the @entity4 approved the annulment of mr @entity156 's knighthood , which was awarded in 1994 , on the recommendation of former foreign secretary @entity183			2
mr @entity156 was the first foreigner to be stripped of an honorary knighthood since @entity187 dictator @entity158 in 1989 , the day before his execution by firing squad			0
in 1979 , art historian @entity188 , who was personal adviser to the @entity4 on art , lost his knighthood after being exposed as a @entity191 spy			2
and in 2007 , boxer ' @entity193 ' @entity192 was stripped of his mbe after serving a sentence for dangerous driving			0
other recent cases involved a doctor who was struck off following the @entity200 baby death scandal , a @entity1 holder who was disqualified from being a company director , and a man who forged the papers that secured him an mbe for ' services to the community '			2
the forfeiture of a knighthood is a rare event , and in past centuries it could involve a public ceremony of degradation during which the accoutrements of the honour would be stripped from the culprit			0
this would happen when a knight was found guilty of treachery or treason			0
in 1468 , sir @entity220 was taken to @entity221 where , being found guilty of treason , his ' gold spurs were hewn from his heels while his sword and all his armour were broken '			0
what is believed to be the last public degradation was in 1621 at @entity228 , when sir @entity229 was found guilty of ' grievous exactions ' and had his spurs broken and thrown away , his belt cut and his sword broken over his head			0
finally , he was pronounced to be ' no longer a @entity235 but @entity236 '			0
more recently , sir @entity237 had his knighthood cancelled during the @entity239 for treason			0
he was executed after trying to enlist @entity242 's help in the @entity244 independence movement			0
count 1 : indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 count 2 : indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl , 15 count 3 : indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl , 15 count 4 : indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl , 15 count 5 : indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl , 15 count 6 : indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl , 15 count 7 : indecent assault between 1/1/84 and 1/1/85 on same girl , then aged 19 count 8 : indecent assault on 31/5/86 on second girl , aged 14 count 9 : indecent assault on same girl , 14 count 10 : indecent assault on 31/5/86 on same girl , 14 count 11 : indecent assault between 1/1/68 and 1/1/70 on third girl , aged 7 - 8 count 12 : indecent assault on fourth girl , 14 , between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76 @entity268 : all guilty			0
