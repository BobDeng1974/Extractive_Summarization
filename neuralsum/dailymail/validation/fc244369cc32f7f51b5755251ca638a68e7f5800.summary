a @entity1 court has ruled that that it has jurisdiction to judge a case against @entity4 , after the @entity6 - based social network blocked a man 's account for posting a painting of a woman 's genitals			1
the @entity1 , a teacher and a father - of - three , posted an explicit 19th - century oil painting depicting the lower half of a naked woman in 2011 , and was subsequently blocked			1
the man sued @entity4 that year , but lawyers representing the social network has argued that it does not fall under @entity1 jurisdiction			2
blocked account : the @entity1 , a teacher and father - of - three , was blocked after posting an image of @entity23 's painting @entity22 on his @entity4 account the unnamed man had posted an image of @entity23 's painting @entity22 on the social networking site four years ago			1
he claims he missed messages and ' social contact ' from his 800 @entity4 friends when the page was taken down on the eve of his birthday on february 27 , 2011			0
at the time , the unnamed man 's lawyer @entity34 said repeated emails to the @entity38 based company demanding the page be reinstated had also gone unanswered			2
he added : ' this blind censorship and refusal to reply to emails suggests he is not worthy of their attention and is someone who has acted immorally or illegally			0
' deleting his account is a breach of his human rights , which guarantees my client 's freedom of expression			0
@entity1 rules : the @entity54 court has ruled that that it does have jurisdiction to judge a case against @entity4 , despite the @entity6 - based social network arguing it has to be done in @entity38 ' it is also in breach of his rights as a consumer under @entity1 law			1
' earlier this year , @entity4 's lawyer @entity64 argued that the site did not fall under @entity1 jurisdiction as users have to sign a clause agreeing that only a @entity38 court can rule in disputes relating to the firm			1
@entity4 's rules state users ' will not post content that is hateful , threatening , or pornographic , or that incites violence , or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence			2
' however , a @entity54 court ruled yesterday that @entity4 's clause forcing all users to agree that any litigation must be based in the @entity6 state , where the site is based , was ' abusive '			1
mr @entity34 hailed the court ruling as a ' first victory won by @entity88 against @entity89 '			0
' this decision will create jurisprudence for other social media and other @entity94 giants who use their being headquartered abroad , mainly in the @entity6 , to attempt to evade @entity1 law			0
' the lawyer said this was an ' abusive clause ' as none of the 22 million @entity4 users in @entity1 ' can ever take recourse to @entity1 legal jurisdiction in the event of a dispute			2
' @entity4 said it noted the judgement and was considering its response			0
the court will hear the case on may 21 .			0
