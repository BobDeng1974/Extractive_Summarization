by @entity0 published : 14:55 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 15:55 est , 13 january 2014 @entity5 police botched an investigation into a mother 's death and wrongly concluded that she had committed suicide , her devastated daughter has claimed			1
@entity10 says she has evidence to prove that her mother , @entity12 , 55 , was actually murdered before her dead body was found floating in a river in @entity15 in 2010			1
she believes that her mother was abducted outside a church where she was going to an evening @entity19 , chloroformed and left in the water near @entity21 in @entity22 , the @entity16 reported			2
she said cops in @entity24 and @entity25 made mistakes throughout the investigation and is now urging them to re-open the investigation - but so far they have not			1
she claims that evidence reveals that her mother was in fact murdered together : @entity10 , left , said her mother @entity37 , right , would never have killed herself ' my mother was murdered , pure and simple , ' she insisted in a press release			1
' and i will never be at peace nor will other members of my family , until this matter is properly investigated and her killer or killers are brought to justice			0
' the battle comes exactly four years after @entity49 , who had said she was concerned she was being followed , vanished after she attended an evening @entity19 at @entity50			0
two months later , her body was found in the @entity52 near @entity53 , more than 50 miles from the church			1
investigators in @entity24 suggested that she had walked from her car and climbed over rocks to @entity58 , where she drowned			1
the investigation was then handed over to police officers in @entity25 , where @entity61 had lived			2
but @entity10 refused to believe that her mother would have ever killed herself and has since spent nearly $ 200,000 hiring her own lawyers and investigators to find out the truth			0
she said she believes her mother was killed because someone had a vendetta against one of her uncles , to whom her mother was close , the @entity16 reported			0
questions : @entity37 's suv was filled with gas before she went to church - which her daughter believes she would not have done if she was planning on killing herself later that night tragic scene : two months after she vanished in 2010 , her body was found in the @entity52 three pathologists ruled the cause of death as drowning but the manner of death as undetermined			1
missed : @entity37 's daughter believes she was kidnapped by the church and dumped in the river attorneys filed lawsuits to get the records of the case and a retired @entity87 investigator gathered witness statements from the scene			1
they claim that @entity37 filled up her car with petrol before going to the church service - which she would have been unlikely to do if she knew she was going to kill herself			1
@entity37 's boots were also immaculate - apart from dirt - suggesting that she did not climb over the rocks to reach the water , and suggesting her body was carried and dumped , they say			2
they add that her purse was torn and that her body had bruising on the shoulder she carried it			2
a lead recovery diver who searched for her body told the team there was no current at the time she is believed to have waded into the water , making it impossible for her body to have drifted so far			0
@entity10 claims that police officers told her footprints led from the vehicle to the water - but they later recanted this after realizing the ground was dry			0
she added that they also failed to pursue claims by witnesses that they saw a man wearing black clothing and a black scarf along the edge of the water that night			0
family : the @entity119 have asked police in @entity5 to re-open the case - but so far they have not her private investigator , @entity122 , said at a press conference last wednesday that after reviewing evidence , he also believes @entity49 was murdered			1
' i am convinced that @entity49 did not commit suicide , ' he said			0
' i think this was a murder			0
' but the police have so far not agreed to re-open the investigation			2
@entity24 public safety lt. @entity132 told the @entity16 that none of the information presented by @entity61 and her investigator is enough to re-open the case			2
' from the police perspective , it does seem to us , by all the evidence we have seen and what our experience has taught us , itâ € ™ s a suicide , ' he said			0
