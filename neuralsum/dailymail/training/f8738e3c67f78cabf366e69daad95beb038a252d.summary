police across the globe launched an unprecedented attack on high - tech criminals behind software , called @entity16 , causing misery to millions			1
@entity19 investigators say the virus has infected between 500,000 and one million computers in 12 countries , which will likely cost millions to national economies			1
' @entity24 is the most sophisticated botnet the @entity19 and our allies have ever attempted to disrupt , ' said @entity19 executive assistant director @entity28			1
but the grip of those behind the so - called ‘ malware ’ has been weakened by a counter attack on the servers which control the software			1
the @entity35 assisted the @entity19 with the operation against the @entity16 botnet			1
' the @entity35 can confirm it has been involved in operational activity supporting the @entity19 disruption action against the ‘ @entity16 ’ botnet , ' said a spokesperson for the @entity35			1
' the @entity35 continues to urge individuals to ensure they have the most up to date anti-virus software to protect themselves from malicious software , ' the spokesperson said			1
those who fail to install anti-virus software risk having their valuable data , including precious photographs , music and personal files held to ransom			1
in the worst cases , victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained by the criminal network			0
@entity57 has spread worldwide but has been temporarily disabled by the international effort by law enforcement agencies			1
potential victims can protect themselves but have only a short time to do so before the hackers can rebuild their network			0
the international effort by forces including the @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , targeted the ‘ command and control ’ servers behind the virus			1
hackers will be able to install new ones , but it is thought that there will be a window of opportunity of at least two weeks for computer users to protect themselves			1
many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers			1
the software installs itself on a computer when the victim clicks on a link in an unsolicited email or via a website			1
in the worst cases , victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained could @entity4 @entity3 , pictured , be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic ? he is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic			1

the 31 - year - old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘ racketeering enterprise ’ that installed malicious software known as ‘ @entity24 ’ on victims ’ computers			1
the software was used to capture bank account numbers , passwords , personal identification numbers , and other information needed to log into online banking accounts			1

it then sends out more emails to lure further victims , without the knowledge of the computer users , and spreads quickly across the internet			1
the virus lays dormant until it spots an opportunity to steal personal details such as online banking information and passwords			2
it then transmits this information back to the criminal network who use it to drain the victim ’s accounts			0
in a further twist , if the user is not a ‘ viable ’ victim then the software locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom			1
at the moment the software demands one @entity189 , an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals , which is around £ 300			2
the @entity193 admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files			1
the software can lock the information on a computer and hold it to ransom - one @entity189 , an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals , which is around $ 500			1

the @entity268 @entity267 urged users to install anti-virus software on their computer and ensure that the latest operating systems were also installed on their computers			1
if systems do not offer automatic updates , people should enable it			0
