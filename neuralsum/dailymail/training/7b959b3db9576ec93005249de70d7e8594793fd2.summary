smoking could be phased out in 2018 in @entity1 for young @entity2 a generation of @entity2 could be on the brink of living a tobacco - free existence if a move to ban the sale of cigarettes to young people is successful			1
the ' tobacco - free ' generation bill is set to be introduced into @entity1 parliament this year , which would make it illegal for people born after the year 2000 to buy cigarettes and for retailers to sell tobacco - laced products to them			1
the law would come into effect in 2018 and would mean people aged 14 this year would not be able to buy cigarettes once they turn 18			1
@entity21 penalties would also be imposed on anyone caught supplying tobacco to the ' tobacco - free generation ' whether they 're a retailer or an individual			2
@entity27 of the @entity29 @entity28 is the brains behind the idea and will put the motion to the @entity1 parliament in the next two months			2

' what we are saying is that anyone who turns 18 in 2018 will not be able to buy cigarettes and eventually when older smokers die out in 20 , 30 years time the sale will end , ' he said			1
' the important thing is that this is not about criminalising the smokers - it 's ensuring retailers and suppliers ca n't sell to anybody born after the year 2000			1
' those aged 14 - and - under could soon be banned from buying cigarettes from @entity1 retailers under new laws which would come into effect in 2018 the idea has received backing from the @entity1 branch of the @entity54 , whose president @entity55 said any effort to reduce levels of smoking in the community is well supported			1
mr @entity28 will bring the private members bill before parliament in november , at the latest , and then open up the conversation for debate next year			0
if successful , the legislation would be implemented by 2018 making it illegal for people aged 18 and under to buy tobacco in @entity1			2
although this particular law would only imply to that state , mr @entity28 said he hopes other @entity2 states and territories would follow suit			1
@entity28 will introduce a bill to ban smoking for 18 - year - old @entity2 in 2018 he said @entity1 has been the fore runner in introducing no - smoking policies across the country			1

' @entity1 has been the forerunner in setting policy in relation to smoking in many areas			0
' we were one of the first states to introduce no smoking in vehicles , no smoking in public places , sporting venues and kids play areas			0
' ' we have consistently set the pattern on no smoking legislation			0
' the push for a tobacco - free generation in @entity1 began two years ago when the @entity100 unanimously supported the idea and the government commissioned a report into the plan from the @entity105			2
mr @entity106 said smoking was a 20th - century phenomenon and with all the known risks associated with the activity there should be more done to eradicate it			0
