@entity1 has been sacked as @entity3 one - day captain and replaced by @entity4 , the @entity0 confirmed on saturday morning			1
only a few days after insisting @entity1 would lead the team at the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity8 in february , @entity3 have performed a spectacular u-turn and removed him			1
he has paid the price for a prolonged run of poor 50 - over form , which has seen @entity3 lose six of their last seven one - day series			2
@entity1 after the defeat by @entity15 , his final match as @entity3 one - day captain @entity1 's form was horrendous - he had n't scored an odi century since june 2012 @entity4 is set to replace @entity1 as @entity3 's 50 - over skipper despite his own poor form questions were again asked of his leadership as @entity3 slumped to a 5 - 2 series defeat in @entity15 over the last few weeks			1
@entity1 's form has dropped off dramatically , with the opener averaging just 30 over the last two years at a pedestrian strike rate of 73			0
a statement released by the @entity0 on saturday morning read : ' @entity0 today announced that @entity4 has replaced @entity1 as @entity3 one - day captain with immediate effect			1
' @entity3 selectors met yesterday to pick a 15 - man one - day squad for the tour to @entity7 and the @entity6			1
' selectors recommended to managing director @entity3 cricket @entity33 a change in captaincy which has now been approved by the @entity0 chairman			0
@entity1 will continue as @entity39 captain			0
' @entity4 has captained @entity3 ’s one - day side on eight previous occasions			1
the 28 year old left hander , who made his @entity3 debut in 2009 , will lead the side in a tri-series against @entity7 and @entity46 in january ahead of the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity8 beginning in february			1
' @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' we spent a considerable time yesterday discussing the make up of a squad that gives @entity3 the best possible chance of success at the @entity6 which begins in less than two months			2
' having reviewed the recent series against @entity15 we came to the conclusion that there was no place for @entity1 amongst our strongest 15 one - day players and therefore recommended @entity4 be appointed one - day captain			1
' ' @entity33 , managing director @entity3 , said : ' i have complete confidence in the decision made by the selectors and having spent time with @entity1 yesterday he accepts that it has been made in the best interests of the one - day side			1
@entity1 admitted he was ' gutted ' to be left out of the @entity6 squad @entity4 described his appointment as a ' huge honour ' but has plenty of work to do snatching @entity1 's captaincy away was not a brave decision ... the selectors should be red - faced ' @entity4 has held a senior role in our limited overs teams for some time and has impressed on the occasions he has led the side			1
i would like to congratulate him on the appointment and wish him , @entity82 and the rest of the squad all the very best over the next three months			0
' @entity1 remains an integral part of @entity3 cricket and continues to have a vital role in developing our emerging @entity39 side			0
i would like to thank him for his leadership of the one - day side since 2011 , a period which saw the team reach number one in the world			0
' @entity1 led the team to more wins than any previous @entity3 captain and also make the final of the @entity102			0
' @entity1 will now focus on an exciting and challenging year of @entity103 beginning with a series against @entity105 followed by an @entity107 summer culminating in a series against @entity109 next winter			0
' @entity1 looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final odi of the series against @entity15 @entity4 said : ' it is a huge honour to captain @entity3 and i am delighted to be leading the one - day side			1
i firmly believe that with the players currently involved in the one - day set up we have the makings of a very good one - day side , a young side that can surprise people at the @entity6			2
' we all recognise we still have a lot of work to do on our one - day game but the potential of this group of players is huge and it is now up to us as players to turn that potential into consistent performances on the international stage starting next month against @entity7 and @entity46			2
' ' @entity1 said : ' i am gutted to be left out of the @entity6 squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment			2
that said i wish @entity82 , @entity4 and the lads all the best for the @entity6			0
i would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me during my time as one - day captain			2
' @entity1 plays and misses at one in @entity142 during another stuttering innings @entity144 told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch @entity1 yet the decision still comes as a shock to many , especially after the @entity0 stuck with @entity1 through a traumatic year for @entity150 cricket			0
last sunday @entity3 coach @entity82 , who has backed @entity1 emphatically since replacing @entity151 in april , said ahead of @entity3 ’s last one - day international in @entity15 : ‘ if you ask my opinion , @entity1 will be captain at the @entity6			1
’ then on monday , just before @entity3 ’s last defeat in their 5 - 2 series loss , managing director @entity33 added : ‘ i would be extremely surprised if he ’s not captain at the @entity6			2
’ now , with @entity3 leaving for a triangular series against @entity7 and @entity46 ahead of the @entity6 in just over a fortnight , the selectors have risked embarrassment by flying in the face of that faith they showed in @entity1			1
@entity82 met fellow selectors @entity47 and @entity166 at @entity167 on friday , while @entity168 joined them via a conference call from his holiday home in @entity171 and @entity33 sat in as a non-voting presence			0
they ultimately reached their decision because of @entity1 ’s inability to make a single decent score in the seven - match series in @entity15 even though they knew conditions there were never going to suit him			0
and the sense of @entity3 being in a state of one - day turmoil is added to by the fact that they will replace @entity1 with a batsman in @entity4 who has a worse one - day record throughout this year than the man he succeeds			1
at least @entity188 , such a key performer in @entity3 ’s one - day batting , seems to be galvanised by leadership — he has scored 427 runs at an average of 71 in eight previous matches as one - day captain			1
@entity1 , nothing if not a stubborn fighter , was said to be bitterly disappointed when he was told the axe had fallen because he was certain that his form would improve once he started playing in @entity199 conditions			0
@entity15 's @entity200 ( right ) celebrates with @entity201 after taking the wicket of @entity1 he was under extreme pressure when @entity3 lost to @entity46 in the second test at @entity205 ’s last summer but managed to turn things around dramatically to win three tests on the trot and was convinced he could do the same in one - day cricket			1
@entity1 , who has never played in a @entity6 , leaves the post having led @entity3 to more one - day victories than any other captain — 36 from 69 matches — which included taking them to the top of the one - day rankings in 2012 and the @entity102 final a year later			1
it was the way @entity1 confounded his one - day doubters after succeeding @entity221 in 2011 that convinced @entity3 he was still their man but they agonised over @entity1 ’s future when he lost one - day series to both @entity15 and @entity46 last summer			1
they stood firm then but have lost their nerve now			0
now , as well as @entity4 , the beneficiaries of @entity1 ’s misfortune look sure to be @entity229 , who will compete with @entity230 to become @entity232 ’s opening partner , and @entity234 batsman @entity233 , who was left out of the @entity236 squad			2
@entity3 had planned to make an announcement about the captaincy on friday night but have delayed it until this morning with new skipper @entity4 in @entity240			0
@entity47 , the national selector , will confirm the @entity6 squad at @entity242 that will do little to dispel the sporting adage that you become a much better player when you are out of a team rather than in it			0
@entity229 , dropped after two matches in @entity15 , @entity248 and the fit - again strike bowling pair of @entity250 and @entity251 will all form part of a 15 - man party that will begin as firm underdogs at the biggest one - day tournament of all			0
@entity3 captain cook leaves the field after being dismissed by @entity200 of @entity15 on december 11 @entity1 , who has suffered some vicious and personal abuse this year as he struggled to rebuild @entity3 from the ashes of their 5 - 0 defeat by @entity7 , has been told to recharge his batteries with his wife and daughter at their family farm			2
the news may be a blow to @entity1 , but it should ensure that he is in better condition , both mentally and physically , at the start of a run of 17 tests in little more than a year which begins when @entity3 tour the @entity272 in april			0
a refreshed @entity1 will be integral to @entity3 ’s hopes of regaining the @entity107 next summer which , whatever anyone in @entity150 cricket says , remains far more important than competing in a 50 - over tournament			0
@entity3 , who have not been @entity6 contenders since 1992 , have had to replace their one - day captains immediately after failed @entity6 campaigns going back to @entity283 in 1996 and continuing with @entity284 , @entity144 , @entity285 and @entity221			1
the only difference this time is that the axing has come before a @entity6 failure rather than after one .			0
