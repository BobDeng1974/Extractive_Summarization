by @entity0 published : 00:34 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 28 may 2013 a sheep born from a frozen embryo that was preserved in a bid to save a rare @entity6 breed at the height of the foot - and - mouth crisis over a decade ago has produced her own set of twins			1
@entity12 , a rare @entity14 sheep , was born in @entity15 in april 2011 from an embryo that had been saved during the foot - and - mouth crisis 12 years ago			1
and now , two years on from @entity12 's astounding birth , the next generation have arrived as @entity12 gave birth her own little duo in april this year			1
ewe beauties : maggie the sheep , who was born in 2011 from a frozen embryo , with her two lambs proud : mother @entity12 stands with her twin lambs born in the @entity29 dales near @entity30 the adorable twin lambs are carrying on the incredible work which was set in motion in 2001 in a desperate attempt to preserve the rare @entity14 breed			1
the devastating epidemic that summer prompted @entity38 farmers to find a way to safeguard the commercially - important breed 's future			0
prof @entity42 worked with the farmers and set up the @entity43 during the crisis , which came up with the idea to freeze embryos			0
prof @entity47 told how @entity12 suddenly became ill in october last year			1
her owner , @entity48 , asked the @entity43 to look after her and she quickly became pregnant the following month			0
@entity12 , a rare @entity14 sheep , was born in 2011 a decade after the foot - and - mouth crisis prof @entity47 , 65 , a lecturer at @entity51 and founder and chair of the @entity43 , said it was all thanks to science that @entity12 has given birth to her own young			1
' this just goes to show that science is evolving everyday and to think this would happen 12 years after the height of the foot - and - mouth epidemic is astronomical , ' she said			1
@entity12 was born and raised with the help of schoolgirl @entity64 , now 15 , who was integral in rearing and looking after the ewe			1
@entity68 vowed to help fight @entity69 on her dad 's farm in the tiny village of @entity73 in the @entity74 after her father told her terrible stories of affected animals being culled			0
@entity68 then passed the ewe onto her new owner @entity79 , who put her back into her flock			0
prof @entity47 said : ' we passed @entity12 back to her owner @entity82 around five months after she was born , and basically said ' here are your embryos ' , and she put @entity85 back in her flock as normal			2
' she was doing amazingly well , but suddenly @entity12 , along with another ewe , became ill and we were asked to take them back			2
' weeks later , @entity12 and the other ewe became pregnant , but we did n't know if they would both make it through			2
' however , thanks to the fantastic work by the @entity43 , @entity12 and the other ewe each now have twins			2
' @entity12 's little ones are beautiful , just like their mother			2
they have n't got a name yet , but they 're so precious			0
' we 're finding that science can help agriculture more and more as technologies get better and better , and research can only improve after this			0
' the @entity105 are one of the most commercially important breeds , and a staggering 20,000 were culled at the height of foot - and - mouth , leading to the fears the breed could become extinct			1
prof @entity47 , of @entity112 , @entity113 , who has her own flock of @entity105 , was approached by @entity38 farmers at the height of the foot - and - mouth epidemic who asked her to use her science to help their sheep breeds threatened by the disease			1
cute : the two lambs , who were born in april take a rest in their @entity29 field importance : the adorable twin lambs are carrying on the incredible work which was set in motion in 2001 in a desperate attempt to preserve the rare @entity14 breed ' the foot - and - mouth crisis was horrendous for everyone in the farming industry , ' she said			1
' i set up the @entity43 at the height of the epidemic , and after i was approached by the farmers to help i thought ' why not '			0
after that i have really become attached to them			0
' now i 'm trying to get some top class scientists and farmers into the same room to discuss how technology can improve farming , and vice versa			0
' the biggest possibility is speeding up breeding , whether it be plant or livestock breeding			0
the science is now there that you can possibly speed up the whole process of 10 - 15 years to just two to three years			2
' it 's an exciting time for farming and science , and @entity12 's twins are a prime example of just how vital science is to the farming world			0

@entity12 , a rare @entity14 sheep , was born from an embryo saved during the foot - and - mouth crisis 12 years ago
