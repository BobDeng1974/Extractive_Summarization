i am not vain , rich or brave enough to face plastic surgery , when my mother rang for her weekly chat and i was feeling ancient after spotting a new wrinkle , i probed her for beauty advice			1
if i was feeling old , she , with a nearly 40 - year - old daughter , must be feeling ancient - yet she looked great			1
at 65 , she could easily pass for ten years younger			0
she 's pictured before ( left ) and after ( right ) ' i thank my genes , the fact i 've never tried a cigarette and the facial stretches i 've been doing for 30 years , ' she said			0
i remember my mum slathered in @entity19 , gurning in a @entity21 tracksuit while i ate my @entity22 , invariably wearing the @entity23 i insisted on sleeping in between 1983 and 85			0
so they worked ? my mother swore they did			1
facial exercises have been around as long as youth has been considered the hallmark of beauty , with some claiming @entity30 was the first celebrity fan			2
the first official guide , however , was published in @entity32 in 1710 , outlining the beauty routine of @entity34 , a courtesan famed for her lasting beauty			0
nearly two centuries later , @entity38 - a notoriously wrinkle - free @entity40 70 - year - old - released his book , @entity41 , which gave away his facial secrets			2
from then on , facial exercisers came thick and fast			0
@entity44 , the funny @entity45 guy permanently in tight @entity46 was the visage visionary of the @entity48 , right up to the @entity49			0
today , however , the go - to expert is @entity51 , the @entity52 - based creator of @entity53 , with a celebrity and royalty - packed client list			1
the @entity56 this involves spreading my fingers across the centre of my forehead , then pulling my fingertips down while pushing my brows up so i look very confused			0
i had to hold this tension for 30 seconds while staring at the ceiling			0
the @entity56 involves spreading the fingers across the centre of the forehead for 30 seconds @entity9 pulls her fingertips down while pushing her brows up to work her forehead muscles the @entity71 this is an exercise which requires a @entity74 smile that moves up and down an inch using visualisation			2
' imagine a plumber bent over in low - slung @entity78 , ' @entity51 encourages			1
' now move your mouth to express that - ew - and hold it			2
' @entity51 encourages exercises to form an ' ew ' expression of disgust and hold it to lift the lips the @entity85 this is n't pretty either			1
it requires me to push up the tip of my nose with my index finger while pulling my upper lip down for a count of 40			1
all of these exercises are performed while looking at myself so i can see that i resemble a tired - looking @entity95 with a hangover			1
but i feel the burn			2
the burn ! the burn that means it 's working ! the next day , after my first facial workout , i wake up to a face as sore as my glutes were after i took my first spin class in 2004 , but i push on with my exercises			1
the @entity85 was so tough that @entity9 's face muscles were still and sore the next day ' after six days of doing her exercises twice a day , i could see significant improvement , ' a gorgeous gal pal , also in her 50s , told me			2
her nickname is @entity109 and i needed her to work her magic on my ageing face			0
luckily , her books and dvds are available on @entity114 and ship within days			0
@entity51 's first foolproof tips seem easy enough to do : sleep on your back without any pillows under your neck and try to avoid carbs after 5pm			1
she also advises drinking more water and eating more protein			0
these things instantly help everyone 's appearance as they get older , apparently			0
the dvd and guidebook then go through a series of exercises that @entity51 promises will take the years off and plump up my ageing skin			1
now my new gym routine is less about getting sweaty in @entity46 and more about sitting in front of a mirror pulling a series of scary , exaggerated expressions , working my 57 facial muscles while sitting with my butt clenched and back straight			0
i work my way through the exercises without any problems - although it hurts more than i thought it would			1
i am a sit - down - with - a - cheese - sandwich - and - a - @entity145 - novel kind of girl rather than a natural gym bunny , but even i 'm shocked my face aches this much			2
i am feeling the desired burn in places i never knew i had			2
facial exercising is not for the lazy - it takes about 20 minutes a day and it really does hurt in places - but after two weeks my husband is convinced he can see a difference , and i feel a bit more plumped up ; more ruddy farmer 's wife than aging , old crone			1
my upper lip is definitely fuller and for the first time in my life i feel bee - stung enough to try red lipstick			1
do i look younger ? i 'd say so			0
perhaps face exercise really are the key to facing forward ? @entity168			0
