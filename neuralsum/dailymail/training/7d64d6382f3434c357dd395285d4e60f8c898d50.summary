there was a time when youngsters would be dressed in their sunday best for a trip to the high street photographer to capture timeless images as they developed from angelic babies to spotty teens			2
however , new 3d printing technology means it is now possible to create ' mini-me ' models – or shelfies - that can be placed on the mantelpiece or sent to granny			1
scanning booths are being opened in @entity18 stores that can capture a 3d image of a person in just 12 seconds as the template to create an 8in model made from layers of ceramic powder			1
@entity18 believes the new technology could see the advent of a new craze for what it calls a ' shelfie ' a miniature model to replace the ' selfie ' that people take with their smartphones			1
during an initial trial it found customers would be keen to use the system to create 3d models of brides and grooms in their wedding outfits , children in their sports kits with medals , forces personnel going on tour and loved ones spending time apart			1
@entity18 found some liked the idea of capturing them wearing fancy dress , while others wanted a permanent record of them before and after a drastic slimming regime			0
the supermarket unveiled the first automatic scanning booth in its store in @entity68 , @entity69 , yesterday and has plans to introduce them into ten more , assuming customers like the idea			1
in fact , it would be possible to create an entire family set of ceramic figures as a permanent record to either sit on a shelf or send to loved ones			1
the advent of 3d printing promises to revolutionise lives in the same way as the home computer and internet			2
3d printers have already been created for domestic use and are becoming increasingly sophisticated , allowing people to print products they need for the home , ranging from ornaments to doorknobs and even sports shoes			0
while the technology is also now being used in medicine to help in facial reconstruction or to build prosthetics to replace limbs , while parts are being modelled for the aircraft and motor industry			0
@entity18 first trialled the creation of 3d models of customers at a store in @entity106 , however this involved a wait of around five minutes as a member of staff effectively surveyed their body using a handheld scanned			1
the new booths can do the job automatically in just 12 seconds			1
the scanner takes thousands of pictures of the customer , mapping every contour and picking up the colours of the skin and clothing			0
computer software then builds up a @entity125 image , like jigsaw , of the individual on a screen			0
the resulting computer file is sent via the web to an @entity18 facility in @entity132 where a 3d printer , which measures about 6ft by 3ft and costs around £ 40,000 , builds the model			1
conventional 3d printers work by building up a figure in plastic , layer by layer , through a nozzle that can only produce models in one colour			1
this new system creates a model from a box which is filled with a white powdered ceramic			2
a series of jets fire water or colours at the ceramic which solidifies			0
it is a similar reaction to putting a blob of water on talcum powder			0
when finished an airbrush is used to remove the fine white powder to reveal the model , which is created in all the colours captured during the original scan			2
the system has six million colours			0
@entity18 's chief merchandising officer , @entity162 , said : ' the possibilities with 3d printing are endless and i 'm pleased that we 're ahead of the game in making this truly transformational technology an everyday reality for our customers			2
' we are committed to making the newest and most exciting technology available to our customers			0
' we were the first to bring affordable 3d printing to the market and customers were queuing round the block to try it out			0
following an overwhelming positive initial reaction from shoppers , the obvious next step was to provide improved innovation that we hope will become a permanent fixture in our stores			0
