@entity1 manager @entity0 was the first to endorse @entity4 compatriot @entity3 ’s highly unlikely bid for the @entity6 presidency			1
however , that support was not enough to stop @entity1 from cancelling a press conference at @entity9 where @entity3 was due to launch his election manifesto			1
instead the event took place at @entity13 on thursday			0
the @entity15 racism row involving @entity1 fans would have put paid to @entity3 ’s appearance there in any case , because racism questions would have overshadowed the event			1
but it emerged on thursday that @entity1 called off @entity3 ’s launch ahead of the @entity15 incident because the club wanted to stay apolitical and felt it ‘ inappropriate ’ to host a challenger to @entity27			1
@entity3 launched his @entity6 presidential manifesto at @entity29 , and spoke about the @entity30 @entity3 speaks to the assembled press in front of a message explaining his plan to ' give back ' to football @entity1 were n’t aware when the booking was first made that it involved publicising @entity3 ’s manifesto — and action was taken immediately it became clear what would be happening			1
the decision was made at communications department level , according to @entity1			0
and it can only be speculation as to whether owner @entity44 would have wanted @entity3 using his club , with @entity46 the next hosts of the @entity30 organised by @entity27 - led @entity6			1
meanwhile , @entity3 ’s manifesto was full of varied proposals from redistributing more money to grassroots football to a 48 - country @entity30			2
but he still came across as a pawn in @entity55 ’s multi-ball attack on @entity27 rather than a genuine contender			0
however , at least he could reel off @entity6 executive names in answer to the inevitable question about how many he knew			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 was the first to endorse @entity3 ’s highly unlikely bid for the @entity6 presidency the @entity63 ’s restructuring , which neither new ceo @entity64 nor chairman - elect @entity65 have explained , includes the ruling body ’s best known figure @entity68 being axed from his role as managing director of cricket partnerships			1
former @entity72 captain @entity68 has been reduced to a 50 - days - per - year ambassadorial role , which might explain his silence over such shabby treatment			2
the @entity63 are already advertising for @entity68 ’s replacement to be called director of participation and growth			2
ex-england captain @entity68 has been axed from his role as managing director of cricket partnerships @entity83 , who have already broken the bank for their £ 4.2billion spend on @entity87 football , have pledged another £ 88m to the @entity88 to extend their deal for another season in 2018 - 19			1
the @entity91 have also settled a solidarity deal with the @entity87 that could see @entity94 clubs getting £ 4m a season from the redistribution			0
the @entity98 renovation is going well enough for @entity99 to be confident of staging a two - day @entity101 meeting there — plus a third day for @entity103 — in july			0
the @entity98 is lit up by fireworks during the opening ceremony of the 2012 @entity103 @entity106 in legal battles @entity106 , pantomime club for all seasons , are still unravelling dysfunctional governance from before @entity110 sold up in 2012			0
former director @entity112 ’s wife @entity111 had her harassment case against @entity110 upheld at the @entity114 before three judges			0
@entity112 had won his harassment case — his wife initially lost — against @entity110 three years ago			0
it followed @entity110 using @entity106 ’ in - house @entity121 station to broadcast appeals for @entity112 ’s whereabouts and using the matchday programme to suggest @entity112 ’s marriage was in trouble			0
@entity112 is now consulting lawyers on whether to pursue former @entity106 chief executive @entity128 , now @entity88 ceo , on the same charge			0
@entity112 alleges @entity128 was involved in organising the radio broadcasts			0
next week ’s @entity133 in @entity134 will see @entity6 president @entity27 collide with the @entity136 ’s @entity135 and @entity137 , who were both vocal at last year ’s @entity138 about the need for a new leader of @entity6			1
but @entity142 @entity136 president @entity141 , hosting the meeting , said : ‘ i ’m sure all @entity133 delegates will concentrate on the rules agenda rather than any other business			2
’ @entity135 is set to clash with @entity6 president @entity27 at next week ’s @entity133 summit the most likely outbreak of hostilities in the @entity6 presidential election is between the spin doctors			1
@entity6 have expressed concern about pr company @entity153 working for two candidates , @entity3 and @entity156 , which no regulation prevents			2
but @entity6 ’s in - house pr team will breach election rules if they promote @entity27 ’s bid for a fifth term — which they are in danger of doing until @entity27 forms an independent campaign team .			1
