by @entity0 a new blood test could tell women if their lifestyle is putting them at risk of developing breast cancer			1
scientists say the test could identify those who are in danger ten years before any symptoms appear			0
this would give them time to take preventative action – which can be as simple as exercising regularly or losing weight – long before the disease gets a hold			1
the breakthrough could see women in their 50s and 60s having regular tests to monitor their risk level by the end of the decade			0
if the scientists ’ hopes are realised , the test could lead to dramatic falls in the number of women who suffer from breast cancer			1
a new blood test could tell women if their lifestyle is putting them at risk of developing breast cancer			1
current tests that gauge your chance of breast cancer rely on identifying those with high - risk dna , and they only work in 10 per cent of cases			2
posed by model the finding , by scientists at @entity39 , involves the first breast cancer screening tool that monitors the scale of damage to genes from environmental factors such as smoking , diet , alcohol consumption and the chemicals we come across in everyday life			1
current tests that gauge your chance of breast cancer rely on identifying those with high - risk dna , and they only work in 10 per cent of cases			2
they are useful in flagging up women with a faulty @entity60 gene such as @entity62 actress @entity61 , who last year had a preventative mastectomy			2
but until now scientists had no early screening method for non-inherited breast cancer , which makes up 90 per cent of cases			1
the new test could be used in regular screening sessions for post-menopausal women			0
around 50,000 @entity72 women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five of them in the post-menopausal years			1
last year , @entity62 actress @entity61 had a preventative mastectomy the @entity39 researchers have now identified a ‘ signature ’ or ‘ tag ’ on the dna of blood cells which is a reliable way of predicting those women who may go on to develop the disease			1
the blood test , which they are developing , works by assessing how far environmental factors have affected the body ’s genes			2
it is not clear what proportion of women at increased risk of breast cancer display the signature , but the scientists hope the test could be used to assess a large proportion of women			1
professor @entity97 , the study ’s lead author , said the test could identify those who are at risk of breast cancer ten years before any symptoms appear			2
‘ the main application would be in post-menopausal women , ’ he said			0
‘ we would do this blood test every five years and then define a specific risk for individual women			0
‘ depending on the risk we could tailor the prevention regime			0
‘ for example , for some women that could mean a change in lifestyle , for others it could mean intensified screening			0
for those at highest risk it could be to use chemotherapy or other treatments for prevention			0
’ more work will be needed to develop the test for clinical use , but professor @entity97 is confident the additional research can be completed in five to seven years so the test could be ready for clinical use by 2020			0
the @entity39 study , published today in the journal @entity132 , was welcomed by breast cancer charities			1
dr @entity134 , senior research officer at @entity135 , said : ‘ these results are promising and we ’re excited to learn how further research could build on these findings			0
’ he added : ‘ this could mean that in the future a woman may be able to have a simple blood test to look for this @entity77 signature			0
‘ if she does have this signature , she could work with her doctor to explore the options available to help her take control of her risk			0
’ dr @entity150 , of @entity151 , said : ‘ looking at changes in the “ tags ” on @entity77 in blood cells taken from people before they develop cancer is an exciting area of breast cancer research			2
‘ it ’s an intriguing finding but we need to understand much more about how these changes influence breast cancer risk before this knowledge can be turned into a screening test			1
