animal welfare activists have labelled the shocking mistreatment of live @entity3 exports in @entity5 countries as ' atrocities '			1
footage released by animal activist group @entity8 has revealed ' sickening abuse ' of cattle and sheep in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 during the @entity17 festival of sacrifice known as @entity19			1
during the festival , animals are slaughtered with the object of meat being given to the poor , but the video footage shows such cruelty to @entity3 produce that the @entity29 regulation of live exports is once again under scrutiny			2
' it is nothing short of criminal , that a year on , we have again seen horrendous abuse of @entity3 cattle in @entity12 while for the exporter legally responsible it is business - as - usual , ' said @entity8 campaign director @entity40			1
' despite extensive evidence of recurring breaches and shocking animal welfare consequences , there has not been a single prosecution of an export company , or a single charge laid			2
' in october , @entity8 launched the largest coordinated live export investigation in history , which uncovered not only cruelty to live exports , but a cover up of the identification of offending exporters			1
the activist group pointed out that while the cruelty evidenced in the vision has come to be associated with the festival , the animal abuses have nothing to do with religion and everything to do with exporters who capitalise on the demand for live produce to slaughter en masse			2
in the footage , sheep are shown to be forced onto trucks for sale with broken legs , bulls with their legs and neck strung out between poles while their necks are roughly slashed open , and bulls repeatedly stabbed in public until they are unable to stand			1
animals are also shown to have their tails broken , to be hit and made to bleed while crowds cheer , among other actions which the group have labelled the activist group claims that investigators looking into illegal sheep sales in @entity13 found that one company was offering locals four sheep in trade for ' beating up anyone with a camera '			1
during the festival , animals are slaughtered with the object of meat being given to the poor , but the video footage shows such cruelty to @entity3 produce that the @entity29 regulation of live exports is once again under scrutiny			2
they further claim that the @entity3 government has ' an abundance of evidence that ear tags are being removed from sheep and cattle being illegally sold and slaughtered in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity12 â€” to prevent identification of the exporter			1
akin to a burglar wiping away their fingerprints to avoid detection , nothing has been done to curb this destruction of evidence			0
' the group has named exporter @entity131 in the investigation , claiming that the company has been implicated for at least 12 breaches of regulations in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity136 allegedly failed to inform the federal government that hundreds of sheep were being sold through a livestock market in @entity14 illegally , with @entity8 claiming that this directly prevented action being taken for the animals in danger of abuse			2
@entity3 exports up to four million sheep and cattle per year , a figure which reflects a growing concern that animals exported have allegedly been deprived of water during extreme heat and left unable to stand after suffering debilitating injuries on long haul trips			1
@entity8 have reported that nine complaints to the @entity154 were lodged , and have said that the abuses could have been avoided if the @entity154 had responded quickly and decisively			0

sheep and cattle had their limbs tied and were denied access to water during periods of extreme heat @entity8 have reported that nine complaints to the @entity154 were lodged , and have said that the abuses could have been avoided if the @entity154 had responded quickly and decisively ' this shocking abuse could have been prevented had the @entity154 taken strong action against exporters who have repeatedly shown a brazen disregard for regulations in these markets , ' said ms @entity40			1
the @entity154 introduced the @entity177 ( @entity178 ) in 2012 to regulate the treatment of @entity3 cattle and prevent them being slaughtered in unauthorised abattoirs			0
a spokesperson from the @entity154 said that the welfare of @entity3 animals remained a priority for the @entity3 government			0
' no - one supports animal cruelty , least of all @entity3 farmers and exporters			0
the @entity154 is investigating the report and will publish its findings , along with any actions taken			0
' ' through the @entity178 we continue to ensure that @entity3 livestock exported for feeder and slaughter purposes are handled and slaughtered in accordance with international standards			0
' ' @entity3 has arguably the strictest system in the world to ensure our exported sheep and cattle are treated as humanely as possible			0
we are the only one of 100 countries that export livestock that seeks to ensure international animal welfare standards are met throughout the entire supply chain			0
' however the activist group claim that the @entity209 and the @entity210 , @entity211 , were failing to act in an organised and credible manner			0
' @entity211 is overseeing a regulatory system that is shambolic and has no credibility whatsoever			0
the only reason the government even knows about these breaches is because of the work of a charity , ' said ms @entity40			0
' the fact that thousands of animals are continuing to be subjected to sickening cruelty in a number of markets , and yet we are seeing no commercial consequences for responsible export companies to motivate compliance , means that we are left with little choice but to relaunch our public campaign to end live export			2
