@entity0 has achieved a lot in a relatively short time , but the @entity3 goalkeeper is not resting on his laurels with the @entity6 title in his sights			1
the 22 - year - old has established himself as one of the world 's best goalkeepers in recent years , impressing first for @entity12 , then @entity13 and @entity15 's side			0
@entity0 ' fine performances have helped bring with it collective success , with the @entity21 ' recent @entity20 triumph making this a fifth straight trophy - winning season for the goalkeeper			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity0 celebrates after @entity25 handed them the lead at @entity28 the @entity30 keeper produced an excellent performance as @entity3 moved closer to the title at @entity33 @entity0 helped @entity3 to the @entity20 earlier in the season and now wants to win the @entity6 @entity3 sit seven points clear of @entity36 at the top of the @entity6 table 2014 - 2015 ( @entity3 ) @entity20 2013 - 2014 ( @entity13 ) @entity39 2012 - 2013 ( @entity13 ) @entity40 , @entity41 2011 - 2012 ( @entity13 ) @entity42 2010 - 2011 ( @entity12 ) @entity43 the @entity45 victory was good , he says , but having been substitute it would understandably be surpassed should @entity3 get over the line in the @entity6			1
' last season , i was part of a team who lost the @entity52 in the last minute , so that 's something i still want to win , and to be able to play for a @entity6 title every season is also a big motivation , ' @entity0 told the club magazine			1
' to win a @entity59 or a @entity60 with @entity61 is another goal			0
' but , it is true , when i was a young kid i dreamed of playing in finals and it 's nice to have won the @entity42 and @entity41 , and won a final against @entity68 , but hopefully i can achieve much more now			0
' every year i 've won one trophy , so it 's nice we won the one at @entity45			2
' but , of course , the @entity6 would be much bigger so hopefully we can add that this season			2
' @entity0 won @entity39 , the @entity40 and the @entity42 during his three seasons at @entity13 his first season with @entity3 in the @entity6 has been a success on the whole there have been some embarrassing moments , such as being lobbed by @entity80 this month @entity0 joined @entity3 in 2011 but this is his first campaign with the club , having spent the past three seasons on loan at @entity13			1
the @entity61 international has displaced club great @entity86 as number one and , despite a few recent slip - ups , proved his worth with a wonderful display in sunday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity28			0
' as a goalkeeper , you might only have to make one or two saves a game - but sometimes really important ones - so , of course , it 's nice that people see it and recognise it , ' @entity0 said			2
' the concentration as a goalkeeper needs to be very high			0
we work on the focus in training and it 's good because , in big teams , one save maybe in minute 88 can be decisive , so it 's very important			0

@entity30 is determined to lift the @entity6 trophy for @entity3
they currently have a seven - point lead at the top of the table
@entity0 has won *silverware* in each of his last five seasons
he already has a @entity20 winners ' medal in his collection
