by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 18 april 2013 @entity1 has admitted he is lucky to be alive after speaking for the first time about his battle with leukaemia			1
in an emotional address at @entity9 ’s training ground , the former @entity6 skipper said he realised how fortunate he was after learning more about the disease			1
the @entity9 captain , 33 , is now in remission from the cancer following 13 months ’ treatment			1
he has come through chemotherapy and now has to take tablets for the next two years			1
and it seems as though his industry has paid off , although he did not hide his relief at having come through a difficult 12 months			2
‘ i have finished all of the high - intensity treatment , ’ he said			2
‘ from now on i ’ll be on the softer one			2
it ’s been a very , very long year			1
i had my hard moments but i had good moments as well			2
‘ i can say i ’m lucky because some people with this disease will die very quickly and i managed to keep battling and still be here , still standing			1
it ’s really good , that ’s a great thing			2
‘ and now , after all of this , i can go back to a normal life			2
i can start doing things that i could n’t do in the last year			1
’ @entity1 played his last game for the club in a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity44 in march 2012			1
he complained of feeling lethargic afterwards and was given the diagnosis a few weeks later after tests			1
happy birthday : @entity1 has revealed he is on the road to recovery following his battle with leukaemia salute : @entity1 acknowledges the @entity54 crowd , who show their support by applauding their no 19 throughout the 19th minute of home games as he had the acute form of the illness , medics wanted to begin treatment immediately , his chances of survival rated at 50 - 50			1
but he has been in remission since the start of the season			1
‘ at the start i thought it was just a cold , nothing serious — just something normal , ’ he said			2
‘ when i was told what exactly the diagnosis was i was a little bit shocked but i accepted it and just wanted to start the treatment straight away			2
my doctor , @entity76 , told me quickly that i had to start treatment			0
i knew i could n’t waste time and i had to make decisions quickly			0
‘ i did n’t know anything about the disease when it happened			0
i did n’t know anything about the treatment , how long it would go on for , what would happen			0
‘ i thought it was dragging on			0
i kept thinking , “ when is this going to finish ? ” but with a lot of support and patience from friends and family , i managed to pull through			0
’ @entity1 said he had been humbled by the reaction from supporters , not just from @entity9 and his former club @entity94 , but across @entity95			1
touching : @entity97 fans hold up a message in support of their captain in action : @entity9 skipper @entity1 playing last season before the diagnosis ruled him out of contention @entity9 owner @entity106 has visited @entity1 on several occasions and chief executive @entity108 also showed the human face of the club by constantly travelling to and from @entity111 in the early stages to provide his support			1
the fans ’ backing has manifested itself in a minute ’s applause in the 19th minute — @entity1 wore the no 19 shirt — a gesture that has received almost universal backing			1
‘ it ’s really funny how something like this can unite people , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a strange feeling but people from all sides have been united and even teams who come to @entity54 , their fans have joined in the minute ’s applause as well			1
‘ it ’s great to see something like that			0
i hope everyone can appreciate how important it is that if something were to go wrong for a player or a fan that they can give them support the way they ’ve supported me			0
‘ i do n’t know how i can thank the fans			0
some people go through these diseases on their own while i have had the support of millions around the world			0
’ thoughts : tributes to @entity1 were displayed by teams around the @entity150 back on track : @entity1 was watching @entity9 's 1 - 1 draw against @entity153 , with @entity155 's opener ( above ) @entity1 hopes to start his own foundation in due course			1
@entity106 has instructed the midfielder to make sure he is recovered properly before any future position at the club is discussed			0
such is the player ’s popularity that an honorary position is likely to be a formality			0
‘ i ’m going to live my life , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ sometimes people feel sorry for you			0
i ’m just going to keep going and try to start picking up some work now and then			0
first of all i ’m going to spend some time with my family , show them that things are back to normal and feel a bit more comfortable			0
the kids especially have really missed me a lot and they ’re happy that i ’m home			0
but most of all i want to get my life back			0
