@entity0 recently said that the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			1
now , @entity6 chief executive , @entity5 has weighed into the discussion , arguing that there is no need to fear @entity10 , and it could even be the making of humanity			1
' these concerns are normal , ' he said onstage during the @entity14 event in @entity15 this week			2
' they 're also to some degree misguided			2
' @entity6 chief executive , @entity5 , says there is no need to fear @entity10 , and it could be the making of humanity the @entity6 chief , who is involved in the development of @entity10 in applications such as self - driving cars , also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted			1
' there 's lots of evidence that when computers show up , wages go up , ' he said , according to a report by @entity34 in @entity35			1
' there 's lots of evidence that people who work with computers are paid more than people without			1
' he argues that machines are far more simplistic that people believe			0
he used the example of an experiment @entity6 conducted a few years ago on a computer ' neural network '			2
the @entity6 chief , who is involved in the development of @entity10 in applications such as self - driving cars ( pictured ) , also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted @entity5 's comments ( right ) following a warning by professor @entity0 ( left ) that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment during the test , company 's scientists used and artificial neural network and inputted 11,000 hours of @entity64 videos to see what it could learn , without any training			1
' it discovered the concept of " cat " , ' @entity5 said			2
' i 'm not quite sure what to say about that , except that that 's where we are			0
' with @entity6 at the forefront of @entity10 development , @entity5 has a lot to gain from public acceptance of the technology			1
our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self - driving vehicles could bring about our demise			1
professor @entity0 has again warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			2
speaking at event in @entity93 , the physicist told the @entity94 that : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			0
' this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity10 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			2
' he argues that developments in digital personal assistants @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 are merely symptoms of an it arms race which ' pale against what the coming decades will bring			0
' but professor @entity0 noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant , with the potential to eradicate , war , disease and poverty			0
' looking further ahead , there are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved , ' continued professor @entity0			0
' there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains			0
' @entity6 's @entity134 start - up , which was bought for £ 255 million ( $ 400 million ) earlier this year , is currently attempting to mimic the properties of the human brain 's short - term working memory			1
by combining the way ordinary computers work with the way the human brain works , the artificial intelligence researchers hope the machine will learn to program itself			0
described as a ' @entity146 ' , it learns as it stores memories , and later retrieve them to perform logical tasks beyond those it has been trained to do			0
the acquisition of @entity134 followed @entity6 's recent purchase of seven robotics firms , including @entity155 , which makes humanoid robots , and @entity157 , which specialises in machines that can package goods , for example			1
in august , @entity6 also revealed it had teamed up with two of @entity163 's artificial intelligence teams to help machines better understand users			2
' it is a really exciting time for @entity10 research these days , and progress is being made on many fronts including image recognition and natural language understanding , ' wrote @entity172 , co-founder of @entity134 and vice president of engineering at @entity6 in a blog post			1
but despite these projects , and @entity5 's comments , @entity6 is also aware of the dangers involved with @entity10 and machine learning			1
so much so that in january it set up an ethics board to oversee its work in these fields			0
in fact , one of the original founders of @entity6 's @entity134 warned artificial intelligence is the ' number 1 risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction			1
' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity134 's @entity189 said in an interview earlier this year			0
the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity198 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			0
earlier this year , @entity200 likened artificial intelligence to ' summoning the demon '			0
the @entity205 and @entity204 founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			0
earlier this year , @entity200 similarly likened artificial intelligence to ' summoning the demon '			0
the @entity205 and founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons @entity6 's @entity134 start - up , which was bought for £ 255 million ( $ 400 million ) earlier this year , is currently attempting to mimic the properties of the human brain 's short - term working memory			1

comments follow @entity0 's warning that @entity10 may be dangerous
' these concerns are normal , ' said @entity5 . ' they 're also misguided '
@entity5 says robots could improve wages , rather than steal human jobs
he added that computers are far more *primitive* that people like to believe
@entity6 is *heavily* involved with @entity10 , including its use in self - driving cars
