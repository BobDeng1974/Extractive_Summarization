by @entity0 published : 19:13 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 19:13 est , 12 april 2013 we all like to take holiday photographs to remind us of the good time we had			2
but the snaps @entity5 brought back from a £ 900 ‘ world class cruise ’ were images she would much rather forget			1
while the brochures boast you can ‘ indulge in escapism ’ as friendly staff ‘ do their utmost to make every part of your cruise experience special ’ , the reality was a holiday from hell			1
illness : @entity5 , 61 , right , documented her ' holiday from hell ' with friend @entity22 on a cruise around the @entity24 on a ship which was overrun with norovirus according to mrs @entity5 , 61 , the luxury liner @entity28 was effectively a ‘ plague ship ’ riddled with norovirus , which left numerous passengers ‘ quarantined ’ in cabins as crew wore masks and nuclear disaster - style suits			1
she claims staff were secretly placed on a ‘ @entity40 ’ warning that forbade them to touch passengers			2
many guests spent the trip suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea , she said			0
according to operator @entity45 cruise lines , 61 of 732 passengers became ill with the highly contagious virus – more than 8 per cent			1
mrs @entity5 spent much of her ten - day cruise isolated in her cabin , where seriously ill friend @entity22 was on two drips hooked over a coathanger and hanging from a porthole			1
mrs @entity5 claims @entity45 knew there were problems with infection , but failed to clean satisfactorily			1
and just hours after the retired nurse arrived back in @entity59 last saturday the ship sailed again with 800 new passengers , she said			2
behind closed doors : crew wore protective clothes and ' were not allowed to touch passengers ' according to mrs @entity5 three years ago the law firm @entity66 , representing 85 passengers , questioned whether @entity28 should remain in service – claiming it had five norovirus outbreaks in 18 months			1
mrs @entity5 , who lives with husband @entity70 , 62 , in @entity71 , @entity72 , said : ‘ it was like a plague ship			1
‘ i barely went out of my cabin because i was confined there with my friend @entity77 , who ’s from @entity78 , with the crew bringing us food			0
she was so ill i watched all night , worrying she was n’t going to make it			2
‘ the worst thing was they already knew they had had the norovirus , because they delayed our departure from @entity59 for 24 hours to disinfect it			2
‘ common sense tells you that you ca n’t disinfect an entire cruise ship in 24 hours , because viruses could get into the air conditioning , the heating , and the ventilation systems			2
‘ because the virus involves sickness and diarrhoea , you can imagine what it was like			0
’ contagion : even the books on the the ship run by @entity107 had to be sanitised mrs @entity5 said the illness spread within 24 hours			1
public lavatories were closed and the casino was off bounds in case cards were infected			0
she said : ‘ we learned from one of the new staff on board that all crew members were on “ @entity40 ” , which he said meant crew were not allowed to touch passengers unless using protective clothing			0
‘ i think this alone shows the seriousness of the outbreak			0
‘ my friend @entity77 , who ’s 70 and a retired accountant and property developer , was very ill and the crew told us that in their opinion she was too ill to be airlifted from the ship			0
but the ship was loaded with another lot of passengers soon after we got off , and our cabin was being cleaned by a normal maid			0
i saw no sign of it being deep - cleaned or sterilised			0
’ expensive cruises have surged in popularity recently – but are all too often struck by virus outbreaks , which spread rapidly in enclosed spaces			0
a @entity45 spokesman said : ‘ the number of guests affected during the cruise was 61 , out of a total of 732 guests			1
‘ the highest number of guests isolated at any one time was 29			0
@entity28 underwent an extensive “ deep clean ” and sanitising operation by independent specialist contractors before she embarked			1
it was extremely disappointing that , following these rigorous measures , the virus was brought back on to the ship			0
