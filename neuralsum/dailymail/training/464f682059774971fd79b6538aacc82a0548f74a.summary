by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 14 january 2013 @entity1 is testing a system which charges users to send messages to people that they are n’t already connected to , with a premium to be paid for contacting very popular people			1
the company confirmed friday that trials have already begun for the new service , but that only a small number of @entity1 users currently have access to the option to pay to send a direct message			1
every user currently has the ability to send a message to any other user for free , however unless being sent to a friend or friend of a friend the message goes directly to the receiver 's ' other ' folder			2
described by @entity1 as the place ' where less relevant messages go , ' this little known option was introduced in 2010			0
communication at a cost : @entity1 is trialing a new service which enables users to send messages directly to people they do n't know at a price the new service offers direct access to the receiver 's inbox , provided the sender is prepared to pay the fee			1
@entity1 initially floated the idea of paying for messages prior to @entity43 , when it was suggested that the service might cost $ 1 per message			2
however a technology journalist at @entity48 was surprised when they attempted to send a message to @entity1 founder @entity50 and received an option charging a hefty $ 100 fee to send a message directly to the social network 's ceo			2
@entity50 has more than 16 million followers on the site and without paying for a direct message to his inbox , any message would go straight to his extremely overcrowded ‘ other ’ folder			0
the company admits it is experimenting with ‘ extreme price points ' to reduce incoming spam for @entity1 users with large subscriber counts and big online presences			1
users are also limited to sending one of these kinds of messages per week			0
@entity1 is confident that imposing a financial cost on the sender will be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and best ensure the delivery of messages that are relevant and useful to the receiver			0
would you pay $ 100 to contact this man ? @entity1 is charging some users a hefty fee to send a message directly to the social network 's ceo ‘ today we ’re starting a small experiment to test the usefulness of economic signals to determine relevance , ' read a @entity1 statement			1
' this test will give a small number of people the option to pay to have a message routed to the inbox rather than the other folder of a recipient that they are not connected with			0
’ several commentators and researchers have noted that the company may be considering a sliding scale of fees depending on the perceived importance of the person being messaged			0
the concept could become an important new revenue stream for the company which held its initial public offering in may last year			0
@entity1 could soon be providing a paid service to all users which enables them to send messages directly to the inboxes of @entity116			1

@entity1 has confirmed is it testing a service which charges users to send messages directly to another user 's inbox
it *potentially* offers every user the *opportunity* to send messages directly to their *favorite* @entity116
however it is experimenting with ‘ extreme price points ' to reduce the number of messages sent to people with large subscriber counts
only a limited number of users currently have access as part of a trial
