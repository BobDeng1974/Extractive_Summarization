@entity8 was in the state of @entity10 reporting on floods which have devastated the region when he made his unorthodox broadcast for @entity15			1
but he has denied the suggestion that he exploited the man by sitting on his shoulders while on camera , insisting that the flood victim ' wanted to show respect ' because he had never met anyone as important as the journalist before			2
scroll down to watch the video controversy : tv reporter @entity8 has come under fire for filming a report from a disaster region while sitting on the shoulders of a victim of the floods a video of mr @entity8 reporting on the floods swept the internet when it was posted to @entity34 earlier this month , with many @entity2 web users criticising him for apparently using a disaster victim to keep his feet dry			1
one commenter denounced him as ' a disgrace to journalism ' , while another said he was ' a ridiculous reporter '			0
in an interview mr @entity8 , who has nearly two decades of reporting experience , admitted that he was wrong to file the unorthodox report , but said that he only sat on the man 's shoulders after the victim had invited him to do so			1
he also blamed his cameraman for revealing the bizarre arrangement , claiming that he had been told he would only be filmed from the waist up			2
defence : the reporter said that the man offered his services because he was so impressed by the journalist ' it was n't my idea to begin with , but there was this man who took me to his home and asked me to report the damage he had suffered , ' mr @entity8 told @entity61			1
' his house was in a miserable condition and he had lost a lot in the flood , and was left with very little food and water			0
' we helped him with some food and some money and he was grateful to us and wanted to show me some respect , as it was the first time someone of my level had visited his house			0
' the reporter added that he had paid the man , whom he refused to name , 50 rupees ( 55p ) for his troubles			0
disaster : survivors being airlifted from the flood region in @entity10 by soldiers last week he admitted that his actions were ' journalistically wrong ' , adding that he had ' no problem getting my feet wet '			2
but mr @entity8 appeared keen to pass blame on to his cameraman for allowing the footage to come to light , saying the report was supposed to be shown ' only with footage of me chest - up '			1
he continued : ' this was entirely the cameraman â€™s fault , who , it seems , almost tried to sabotage my career by shooting from that distance and angle and releasing the video mocking this whole incident , and making me the villain			0
