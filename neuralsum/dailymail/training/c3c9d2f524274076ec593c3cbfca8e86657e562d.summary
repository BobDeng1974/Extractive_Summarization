by @entity0 last updated at 9:19 am on 30th january 2012 discipline : @entity2 has backed @entity5 mp @entity4 's call for a rethink on smacking laws @entity2 has backed calls for parents to be allowed to smack their children to instil discipline			1
the mayor of @entity13 spoke after a senior @entity5 mp blamed his party ’s partial ban on smacking children for last august ’s riots			1
former education minister @entity4 called for a return to @entity20 laws on discipline , saying working - class parents needed to be able to use corporal punishment to deter unruly children from joining gangs and wielding knives			1
he claimed parents were ‘ no longer sovereign in their own homes ’ and feared that social workers would take their children away if they chastised them			2
@entity5 ’s 2004 law did not completely ban smacking , but said a smack should cause no more than a reddening of the skin			2
last night mr @entity2 supported mr @entity4 , saying the current law was ‘ confusing ’ , meaning that parents do not know how far they can go in terms of smacking their children			1
‘ people do feel anxious about imposing discipline on their children , whether the law will support them , ’ he told the @entity40 programme on @entity41			0
‘ i think there ought to be some confirmation that the benefit of the doubt will always be given to parents in these matters and they should be seen as the natural figures of authority in this respect			1
' obviously you do n’t want to have a licence for physical abuse or for violence and that ’s very important			0
’ the mayor said he believed he had the support of education secretary @entity61			1
‘ i know that people will have their own views , but let me just say on the issue that ’s been raised a lot of times with me ; the issue of are you allowed to chastise , are you allowed to impose discipline ? ’ aftermath : @entity4 inspects riot damage in @entity71 last summer			2
he wants the ban on smacking children overturned to help prevent a repeat of the mass disturbances lack of discipline : mr @entity4 said many of his constituents had told him the outbreaks of nihilistic violence that characterised the riots had been down to their inability to properly chastise their children mr @entity4 , mp for @entity71 , where last year ’s riots started , said : ‘ many of my constituents blamed the @entity5 government afterwards , saying : “ you guys stopped us being able to smack our children ”			1
‘ these parents are scared to smack their children and paranoid that social workers will get involved and take their children away			0
’ mr @entity4 said middle - class families can handle rebellious children by putting them in tennis classes or private schools – options not open to poorer parents			1
parents in @entity71 had to ‘ raise children on the 15th floor of a tower block with knives , gangs and the dangers of violent crime just outside the window ’ , he said			0
‘ we should return to the law as it existed for 150 years before it was changed in 2004 , ’ he said			0
‘ the law at that time left judges to determine if a parent had used reasonable chastisement			0
‘ under the new arrangements , it is left to social workers			0
‘ we should allow 99 per cent of parents to determine how to help their children understand boundaries and learn right from wrong			0
’ mr @entity4 said he had smacked his sons , aged three and five , ‘ but it does n’t happen very often – usually when they are in danger ’ .			2
