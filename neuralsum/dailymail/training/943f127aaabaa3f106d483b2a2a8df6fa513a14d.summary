a high school class in @entity1 has apologised after teenage pupils allegedly started greeting each other with ' @entity4 ' and communicating in @entity6 slogans			1
the children of class 9a said sorry for their actions on @entity10 after intense pressure from parents and staff at the school , in @entity15 in east @entity1 - but claimed that not all of them were involved			1
it comes after it emerged that all 29 members of the class - including a @entity19 boy - subscribed to a @entity21 chatroom where @entity4 and the @entity22 were routinely praised			1
horrific : a photograph of one of the male students in class 9a at the @entity28 near @entity15 , east @entity1 , shows him raising his right arm in a @entity6 salute the @entity32 students said : ' we , as class 9a from the @entity34 , apologise for everything that has been published which has caused our school damage , and that which is still to come			1
' these were ill considered actions which we are not able to make up for			2
' furthermore , it was not the whole class which was responsible			2
that 's why we would like to apologise , even to our uninvolved classmates			0
' they accused the @entity47 newspaper in @entity1 , which broke the story , of ' twisting ' facts ' but want to apologise for these anyway , even if they were not meant seriously			1
and we promise that never again will there be such behaviour in the class of 9a again			2
' it was signed on behalf of ' all those responsible '			0
parents and authorities were left horrified after it emerged that some of the 14 and 15 - year - olds had been swapping @entity6 sayings and slogans throughout the school day			1
local media reports suggested students regularly made @entity66 slurs on the messaging app , while praising @entity4 as a ' great man '			1
fear : parents are in shock after media reports that students in the class , boys and girls ages 14 and 15 , appear to have been engaging in the behaviour on @entity21 one of the messages from a student made a @entity80 joke that read : ' why did @entity4 kill himself ? the @entity19 sent him the gas bill			1
' two youngsters - believed to be the ringleaders - are now under intense police scrutiny after they stuck on fake @entity4 moustaches and were photographed giving the @entity6 salute inside school classrooms			1
the school is currently closed for the autumn half term but police detectives , psychologists , educationalists and parents are set for stormy meetings there with the headmaster in a week 's time when it reopens			2
the praise of , or display of , @entity101 and its symbols is strictly forbidden in @entity1 and first offences can carry a maximum prison term of six months			1
police want to determine whether the @entity107 sentiments expressed by the youngsters were merely a form of teen rebellion or if they went deeper			0
disgusting : screen grabs from the @entity21 conversations see students using the ' @entity4 ' phrase photos of 14 and 15 - year - old students show them giving @entity6 salutes and wearing @entity4 moustaches @entity119 , the former head of the local @entity120 , said his son had experienced harassment at the school			1
' my son told me that someone had stuck a far - right @entity127 [ @entity127 ] sticker on his jacket			0
it was well known , it seems , that he was @entity19			0
' ' i have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation , but on the other hand it would definitely be the wrong thing to simply accuse the entire class and tar them with the same brush			2
' he said : ' even after i read about it , i found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on			0
it was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true			0
' a spokesman for the state educational affairs minister in @entity149 said : ' i am shocked			0
if this is true there can only be one way forward here : zero tolerance			0
' the @entity21 exchanges have been handed over to police and prosecutors			2
in shock : the school , @entity32 near @entity15 , where the teenagers all study the school headmaster @entity162 said the entire school had been shocked , and that the secret @entity6 sympathisers were confined to one class			1
getting to the bottom of how it happened would be difficult because the autumn break had already started , he said			0
he said the parents of two of the children involved had been invited to a discussion together with their children , but that a third who they wanted to speak to was on holiday in @entity177			2
he said he did not want to instantly accuse the children , saying : ' breaking taboos is part of young adulthood			0
i do n't believe that they wanted to actively promote @entity185 ideology			0
' all the class students , like all children in @entity1 , have visited a @entity6 concentration camp and regularly learn about the excesses of the @entity6 in classes			1
neo-nazi groups significantly stepped up their recruitment of children in recent years			0
