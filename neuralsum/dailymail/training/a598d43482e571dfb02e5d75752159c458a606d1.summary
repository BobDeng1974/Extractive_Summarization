by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 21 august 2013 a student who achieved three a grades in her @entity3 may be forced to move to @entity4 to study to become a doctor after four universities in the @entity7 turned her applications down			1
@entity9 , of @entity10 in @entity11 , achieved as in chemistry , biology and geography , but was denied a place at all of the universities she had applied to , including @entity17 and @entity18			1
this is despite other students from @entity21 being offered places to study medicine , even though their grades were not as good as @entity9 's			1
devastated : @entity9 achieved top marks in her a levels , but was rejected to study medicine by every university she applied to forced overseas : the 18 - year - old is hoping to secure a place at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity4 the 18 - year - old said : ' studying medicine is so competitive and there are only a limited number of places available , i know , but it has been my dream to become a doctor for quite a few years now			1
' i did have interviews at @entity40 and @entity41 but did n’t get in , which has been really disappointing			0
' @entity9 , who has two gps within her extended family , now faces the prospect having to move to the @entity4 city of @entity31 , where she will be able to pursue her ambition at @entity30			1
the qualification they offer is recognised by the @entity49 and other countries across the world			0
counting the cost : @entity9 will need to find £ 60,000 to pay for her course but if she does decide to move overseas she will need to raise £ 60,000 to pay for the six - year course at because she will not qualify for the usual student grants or financial help open to other under graduates in the @entity7			1
she said : ' i attended a medical student conference at @entity60 that mentioned the @entity4 medical school , and it does appeal to me because it is a very practical course , but with the tuition fees , accommodation , food and travelling expenses it will cost about £ 10,000 per year			2
' although i do have some savings , i do n’t think i will be able to get enough money on my own to go there , but it ’s something i am considering			0
' @entity9 originally had ambitions of becoming a midwife or nurse but was encouraged by her teachers to aim higher and become a doctor after they saw her potential			1
her mother @entity76 said : ' @entity9 was devastated to get rejected from the four universities , particularly @entity17 , where she thought she did well			2
' it is so frustrating when some of her friends did get places to study medicine even though their results were not as good as @entity9 ’s			2
' a spokesman for @entity85 , which handles applications on behalf of universities , said if a student failed to get into the university of their choice this year , they could apply again next year			2
he added : ' securing a university place is competitive , and although students may miss out on the place they hoped for , other universities are likely to make them an offer			2
' there are still thousands of courses with vacancies in clearing , listed on the @entity85 website			0
if an applicant has their heart set on a particular course that is n’t available , one option is to apply again next year			0
' rejected : @entity40 was among the four @entity7 institutions that turned the promising student down sadly miss @entity9 is not the first hardworking student to fall of the exacting standards enforced by many top flight universities			1
last week @entity113 found himself in the same situation when he was rejected from @entity115 despite getting seven a * s in his a-levels			0
but the teenager from @entity119 , @entity120 in @entity121 was more than consoled by the flurry of offers received from across the @entity124			0
having secured top grades in biology , chemistry , physics , maths , further maths , @entity131 and @entity132 he was offered places at both @entity134 and @entity135			1
but he decided to accept a place at @entity137 , one of the world ’s leading research and teaching institutions in @entity142 , where he plans to study chemistry from september			2
the most famous incident of this kind came in 2000 when northern teenager @entity145 , hit the headlines			0
her rejection from @entity115 ignited a national rows about elitism in the country ’s best universities after @entity152 refused the then 18 - year - old a place even though she got five top grades in her a-levels			1
prime minister @entity156 - who was chancellor of the exchequer at the time - dubbed @entity115 's decision a ' scandal ' and launched a bitter attack on the university 's selection procedures			0
dr @entity145 , from @entity162 , was offered a £ 35,000 scholarship to study @entity164 at @entity134 where she graduated with honours			0
