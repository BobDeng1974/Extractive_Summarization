june @entity0 says an apology from @entity2 is ' not enough ' but she hopes to one day ask him to his face why he killed her daughter @entity5 june @entity0 has revealed she and her husband are willing to one day meet @entity2 and ask him face to face why he shot dead their daughter			1
the couple have never actually met @entity2 , who was last month jailed for five years for killing their daughter @entity5 , but mrs @entity0 is steeling herself for the inevitable day they finally meet and have the opportunity to ask him why he pulled the trigger			1
during his trial , @entity2 stood before the court and issued a tearful public apology to the @entity18 - an act she said she was completely unmoved by - and he has also made a request to meet them in person			1
but this request came too soon after the harrowing ordeal of losing their daughter and at that time they were not yet ready to speak to him			2
' what can he say ? sorry is not enough , ' she told the @entity30			0
' what can he say and what would we want to talk to him about ? i do n't know			0
' but one day that confrontation will come			0
violence ? no , i do n't think so			0
but that day has to come			0
' following a seven month trial , on october 21 @entity2 was acquitted of murder and found guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide in a ruling and interpretation of the law which was heavily criticised for being too lenient			2
under the current terms , the paralympian is eligible for release after 10 months and would then complete his sentence under house arrest			2
mrs @entity0 's belief that she and her husband will one day meet with @entity2 follows her claims her daughter never had sex with him during their three - month relationship and was about to leave the disgraced athlete on the night he shot her dead			1
@entity2 previously told his murder trial that the couple were planning a life together , but she said she has ' no doubt in her mind ' that her daughter wanted to end their romance and believed it was only a matter of time before he killed somebody			1
she also said the model refused to sleep with the paralympian because she had ' nagging doubts about their compatibility ' , the @entity67 reported			0
in judge @entity74 's judgment explaining why she could only convict @entity2 on culpable homicide , or manslaughter , the 67 year - old judge acknowledged that a ' reasonable ' person with @entity2 's disabilities would have foreseen that shooting into the door may have killed the person inside			1
june and @entity81 ( pictured ) are steeling themselves for the day they meet @entity2 face to face left , mrs @entity0 pictured listening to evidence in court during the @entity2 trial , and right , her daughter @entity0 , who @entity2 said he mistook for a burglar when he shot her through a bathroom door however , she said @entity93 legal precedents warned against automatically assuming that because a perpetrator ' should have ' foreseen the consequences of his actions that he actually did			1
she said that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the double amputee foresaw the fatal consequences of his actions when he shot at the door , meaning she could not convict him on a murder charge			0
but @entity93 prosecutors have confirmed they will appeal the manslaughter verdict and five - year prison sentence after failing to secure the murder conviction			1
@entity109 spokesman @entity108 said the next step would be to file papers in court			0
june and @entity81 ( pictured ) sat through often graphic and bloody forensic evidence detailing the killing of their daughter @entity0 pictured with @entity2 in early 2013			1
the two had been seeing each other for three months before the shooting it came amid reports the runner had spent £ 1million in legal fees during the trial - with nearly half that amount still unpaid - raising questions how the athlete would fund a second defence			0
last week , prosecutors admitted they had ' an appetite ' for an appeal , with chief lawyer @entity132 holding urgent meetings with the country 's most senior legal experts to build a case			2
professor @entity137 , who was one of the first to be consulted , said it would not be straightforward process			0
the high - profile nature of the @entity2 ’s trial had raised questionable legal precedents that academics argued against for years , he added			2
a ruling on a case heard before @entity93 ’s @entity146 more than 30 years ago set a precedent that now limits the state ’s right of appeal			0
in order for the verdict in @entity2 's case to be challenged , the earlier case would also have to be appealed .			1

june @entity0 says she is prepared to meet @entity2 face to face
but she is *adamant* an apology for shooting her daughter is ' not enough '
prosecutors have *announced* intention to appeal his verdict and sentence
