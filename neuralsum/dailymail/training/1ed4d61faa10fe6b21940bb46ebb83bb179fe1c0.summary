as the nation prepares to tune in to the @entity2 special of @entity3 , the real - life mistress of the house has told how a frisky @entity6 led her a merry dance			1
@entity9 , who with her husband owns @entity12 castle where the hit tv series is filmed , had to shout to her staff for help as she chased through the grounds after @entity6 , one of her ponies			1
it happened after she and @entity20 arrived back suffering from jet - lag at the castle in @entity12 , @entity22 , following a trip to @entity24			1
it follows a special charity skit involving cast members and @entity40 heavyweight @entity39			2
but revealing her real - life drama at the castle , @entity9 wrote on her website : ' one night we were at a @entity45 , with the @entity46 and @entity47 arriving to support @entity48			1
long dresses , amazing fund raising ( i think our auction prized hit the top note ) and then back today to chasing naughty ponies around fields			0
' the little chestnut pony , @entity6 , nosed out of the field gate and escaped within one unfortunate second			1
' revelling in freedom , lots of grass and the huge area in front of the castle , i had no hope of catching him			0
the large open landscape and park rather lost its attractions for me at that moment			0
@entity6 just kicked up his heels			2
' the hit @entity73 series is filmed at @entity75 , pictured , which is owned by @entity9 and her husband @entity40 comes to @entity3 : @entity39 cut a dapper figure in the first look from his episode of @entity3 @entity39 ( left ) , @entity80 ( centre ) and @entity82 ( right ) pose for pictures after appearing in @entity84 : @entity3 on @entity73 she described how she returned to the castle courtyard and asked a man to help her - but after attempting to herd the animal towards a corner he remarked : ' i did not know he could move so fast '			1
@entity9 added : ' we retired for coffee			2
no other man offered to help ( they were all remarkably busy around cars )			0
' but they had wished they had videoed me running round the field ! ' i changed into the next set of clothes to trudge out and get wet again			0
it was two hours into my morning , the fields are truly huge			0
' i walked to retrieve the trail of empty food buckets with which i had been trying to bribe the happy @entity6			2
' to my delight he started to follow me so i realised that rather than catch him , i and the buckets and he would all try to go through a gate together			0
and oh joy it happened			0
' at lunchtime my husband - the other @entity6 - said it was a bit silly not to shut the gate carefully first of all , so he was quite lucky to get any supper ! '			1
