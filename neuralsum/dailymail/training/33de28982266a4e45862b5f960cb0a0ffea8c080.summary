@entity0 today tried to laugh of questions about his future , denying his leadership was in crisis			1
the @entity6 leader used his first appearance since claims one in five of his frontbench team want him to quit to insist it was a ' privilege ' to do his job and he does not wish his brother @entity12 was in the job instead			1
mr @entity0 tried to woo business leaders with a promise never to take @entity16 out of the @entity17 , accusing @entity18 of playing ' political games ' after the prime minister hinted he could back exit without significant changes to @entity16 's relationship with @entity24			1
pollsters @entity41 found that only 34 per cent of people who voted @entity6 at the last general election believe mr @entity0 is up to the job of prime minister , compared to 51 per cent just a month ago			1
the sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted @entity6 in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader			1
senior @entity6 figures have publicly admitted the party is having ' jitters ' about mr @entity0 's stewardship of the party , and have issued a put up or shut up plea for plotters to ' show us your colours '			1
today mr @entity0 attempted to brush off the reports , saying he agreed that ' you should n't believe everything you read in the papers '			2
appearing at the @entity63 conference in @entity64 , mr @entity0 - who beat his brother @entity12 to the @entity6 leadership - was asked if he wished ' the other guy had won '			1
mr @entity0 said : ' definitely not			2
' it is a huge privilege doing this job			0
what excites me is the way we can transform this country			0
the country has huge advantages , huge talent			0
' asked if he agreed there was a ' crisis of confidence ' in his leadership , he replied curtly : ' no. ' instead he sought to use his appearance in a room of industry leaders to burnish his business credentials with an unashamedly pro-european speech			2
mr @entity0 told the @entity63 conference in @entity64 that it was a ' huge privilege ' to be @entity6 leader the @entity6 leader warned threats to leave the @entity17 risked putting the @entity16 ' on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off ' @entity97 business secretary @entity96 senior @entity6 figures today publicly rallied behind @entity0			1
but their attempt to shore up mr @entity0 's position risked being derailed when shadow business secretary @entity96 - widely tipped as a possible future leader - appeared to muddle him up with his elder brother @entity12			1
mr @entity96 admitted there were ' noises off ' about mr @entity0 's leadership , but told @entity108 's today programme : ' it is a small minority of people , who are doing so anonymously and off the record			1
' however , in a later interview , mr @entity96 appeared to mix @entity0 up with brother @entity12 , who he defeated by a narrow margin in the 2010 contest for the leadership			1
the shadow business secretary told @entity117 : ' i know , for my constituency , ( we have ) a united @entity6 in ensuring that we get @entity12 , um , that we get @entity0 into no 10			1
i know ultimately that that 's what 's going to make a difference to their lives			0
' the @entity126 have promised to renegotiate the @entity16 's membership before an in - out referendum , but @entity6 today suggested it would be ' dangerous ' to give the public a say			1
support for leaving the @entity17 has risen in recent weeks , in part as a result over the shock demand for @entity16 to pay an extra £ 1.7billion to @entity24 coffers , which has since been cut to £ 850million			1
mr @entity18 has toughened his position in the face of a surge in backing for @entity139			2
today he insisted @entity16 can not secure reform of the @entity17 by just saying it will ' stick with whatever we have come what may '			1
however , in a speech to the @entity63 , mr @entity0 ruled out ever threatening @entity16 's membership of the @entity17			1
he said : ' there are some people in our country who advocate exit from the @entity17			2
' there are others who flirt with it , thinking they can do so without consequence and perhaps with advantage to @entity16			2
' in my view both are equally dangerous			0
giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the @entity17 , or contemplating it , simply drags us closer to exit			2
' and every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business			0
' in an attempt to shore up @entity6 support among pro-eu business leaders , he will claim that ' ever - more incoherent demands ' from mr @entity18 has made @entity16 ' ever - more isolated from its partners ' , putting the @entity16 ' on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off '			1
mr @entity0 added : ' if i am prime minister i will never risk your businesses , @entity16 jobs , @entity16 prosperity by playing political games with our membership of the @entity17			1
' the way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them			0
not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them			0
not to make promises everyone knows you can not keep			0
' mr @entity18 is due to set out detailed proposals for reforming freedom of movement rules before the end of the year in an attempt to reduce the flow			2
he has pledged to put @entity16 's @entity17 membership to an in / out referendum in 2017 if the @entity205 form the next government in 2015			1
appearing at the @entity63 this morning , the prime minister defended his plan to put freedom of movement rules at the heart of his renegotiation			0
mr @entity0 sought to laugh off growing doubts about his leadership , and rejected the idea he wished his brother @entity12 ( right ) was in charge the @entity207 said : ' you never get anywhere in life unless you have a clear strategy and a plan , ' he used his own address to the gathering to declare			2
' and you never get anywhere unless that strategy and that plan includes all the things that matter to your customers and your shareholders			0
' @entity16 's future in @entity230 matters to our country and it is n't working properly at the moment and that is why we need to make changes			2
' i agree with what the @entity63 has said : we should be looking for a reformed @entity17			0
' now i am the politician who has the plan for that reform			0
who wants to see the single market safeguarded and not have us ordered around by the single currency countries			0
' who wants to make sure we belong to a @entity230 that is about a common market and co-operation and not about ever - closer union			0
prime minister @entity18 , at the @entity63 conference today , warned @entity16 can not secure reform of the @entity17 by just saying it will ' stick with whatever we have come what may ' ' and i want to be part of a @entity230 that addresses people 's concerns including concerns about immigration			1
' i am clear : these things can be done			0
these things can be negotiated and we can then hold that referendum and give people a proper choice about staying in a reformed @entity17 or opting not to belong to it			0
' in a clear dig at mr @entity0 , he went on : ' that is a plan			0
that is a strategy to secure the best future for @entity16			0
' simply standing here and just saying ' i will stay in @entity230 , i will stick with whatever we have come what may ' that is not a strategy , that is not a plan and that will not work			0
' @entity63 president sir @entity278 said four out of every five @entity63 members would vote to stay in the @entity17 in a referendum because it was ' overwhelmingly ' in the @entity16 's national interest			1
' do not be fooled - by withdrawing from @entity230 , we do not somehow become more open to trade elsewhere			0
instead we turn inwards , going against the grain of an increasingly connected world			0
