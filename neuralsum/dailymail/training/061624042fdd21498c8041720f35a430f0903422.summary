by @entity0 and @entity1 she 's known and loved for her thrifty approach to dressing and the @entity4 kept up her recycling reputation on tour in @entity7 today by wearing not one , but two dresses we 've seen before			1
first up this morning , @entity4 ditched the bright hues she has so far worn @entity12 , and instead opted for a gorgeous light coffee coloured dress by @entity17 - based @entity16 fashion designer @entity15 as she touched down at @entity19 airport , in the @entity20			1
and it 's not the first time the @entity4 has worn a shift dress in this style - we 've seen her in a strikingly similar number by the same designer twice before			1
she wore the elegant , knee - length dress again in july 2012 at the @entity49 reception at the @entity50 in @entity17 ’s @entity51 , where she met with @entity53			1
and heading for desert terrain and 31c to visit the scared @entity56 site of @entity19 , @entity4 chose a light brown version of the frock today and looked immaculate teaming it with patent nude heels			1
later in the day , @entity4 looked the picture of summer in a patterned white and beige @entity30 dress , as she took a walk down @entity65 at the base of @entity19 in @entity19 with husband @entity35			1
@entity4 snapped up the appropriately named ' @entity68 ' dress , which cost £ 35 , in the sale from @entity71 store @entity30 back in 2012			1
she first wore the ensemble while trying her hand at some table tennis and football in july 2012 as she , @entity34 and @entity35 attended the launch of a project in @entity17 that aims to train the next generation of sports coaches			2
she even opted for the same beige platform shoes , a footwear style she covets , and re-wore the £ 85 @entity82 from @entity83 - she has the same style in navy blue , too			0
simple : @entity86 of @entity87 looked sophisticated in a light coffee colour as she arrived at @entity19 airport with the @entity29 double take : @entity4 - who is famous for recycling outfits - wore a very similar dove grey dress in 2011 in @entity93 , @entity43 and in 2012 in @entity17 touch down : the royal couple appeared to match their hues once again as they arrived in @entity19 hot : the pair were met with a very warm @entity99 as the landed in central @entity7 and @entity100 appeared to squint from the sunshine picture perfect : later in the day , the @entity29 and @entity4 posed for a snap with @entity19 in the background during the sixteenth day of their official tour to @entity106 and @entity7 she loves that dress ! @entity86 of @entity87 looks radiant as she poses in front of the @entity19 , also known as @entity19 , in her thrifty dress with prince @entity35 today dramatic scenes : the royal couple take in the sights as they walk down @entity65 at the base of @entity19 in @entity19 , @entity7 as for her husband , @entity100 's cream and beige desert ensemble was n't quite as bold as the real safari garb his father @entity119 wore when visiting @entity19 31 years ago in march 1983 with princess @entity120			1
it is not only the third time @entity4 has chosen to wear a dress in this style , it is also the second time she has worn a dress by designer @entity15 during this royal tour			1
the 32 - year - old previously wore a bright maize yellow wool crepe dress with feature white panels by the designer on her arrival in @entity134			2
royalty of the genuine , political and @entity137 variety have all demonstrated their fondness for @entity15 's idiosyncratic and ever - elegant creations			1
princess @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 are just some of the sartorially clued - up women to appreciate her bold colour - blocking and clean , unfussy lines			0
welcome gift : @entity86 of @entity87 is given a necklace during a @entity151 display at @entity19 this is n't the first time that @entity4 has recycled an outfit during her tour			1
as she took part in a friendly race in @entity159 sailing boats on @entity161 's @entity160 last week , she wore a look we 've seen not once , but twice before			2
@entity86 donned blue @entity165 skinny jeans and a £ 48 me + @entity167 - style top with a £ 79.99 navy @entity169 jacket and cool @entity172 sunglasses			0
@entity4 was seen wearing the exact same look at an event at the @entity175 in @entity17 in her role as patron of the charity sportsaid last october , where she showed off her toned stomach following the birth of @entity181			0
@entity183 fans will notice that @entity4 , who is well known for recycling her wardrobe staples , wore a very similar navy outfit at the @entity186 when she paid a visit to the athletes in the @entity190 village , too			1
today the @entity4 left her long brunette hair down for her visit to @entity19 , one of the most romantic places in @entity7			2
and she accessorised her simple yet sophisticated look with a small cream clutch bag and dangle drop earrings			0
@entity35 and @entity4 arrived at the landmark - also known as @entity19 - exactly a week before their third wedding anniversary			2
glossy : @entity4 's brown hair shone in the sunshine as she clutched a small nude bag smiles : @entity35 and @entity4 giggle as the @entity29 holds an @entity56 spear at the @entity207 special place : princess @entity120 and prince @entity119 also visited @entity19 , 31 years ago in march 1983 favourite : @entity4 previously wore a yellow @entity15 when she arrived in @entity134 they then took a late afternoon stroll around one of the largest and most sacred sites in the world			1
taking a walk around @entity19 as it glows red in the afternoon sun is a magical experience and @entity35 and @entity4 had the time for a leisurely look around the base of the rock which rises 348m from the desert floor			0
the red centre of @entity7 has turned on a show of green with blooming wildflowers for the royal couple , following recent rains			0
due to its size - @entity19 or @entity19 is 9.4km around the base - the @entity29 and @entity4 will only be able to take in part of it , just as prince @entity35 's parents did 31 years ago , although @entity35 and @entity4 are not expected to climb the rock as @entity119 and @entity120 did			2
glowing : @entity35 and @entity4 will get to experience @entity19 's magical red colour instead they saw ancient rock paintings , a sacred waterhole and met the traditional custodians , the @entity239 people , and the @entity4 was told about the special ' women 's place ' at the rock 's base by respected elder and famous tribal tracker , @entity244			0
@entity244 had a special gift of paintings on paper made out of wallaby poo droppings to give to the @entity4			0
prince @entity35 and @entity4 are seeing @entity19 at the most beautiful time of year , when many people come to celebrate anniversaries , propose marriage or just enjoy a glass of champagne in the car park which has a panoramic view of @entity19 at the spectacular moment of early evening glory when the sunsets and its red glow peaks			0
after night fall there is a magnificent blanket of stars overhead , the @entity265 even more visible in the desert away from city lights			0
@entity35 and @entity4 are expected to spend the evening out in the desert at the luxury camping resort @entity270 101 , where they will retire into a cosy and glamorous ' tent ' room as the temperature outside drops into the teens			0
' it is the most remote place on earth the royal couple will have ever been , ' said @entity282 communications director , @entity281 , ' people do come here specially for wedding anniversaries and other meaningful dates			0
' would n't it be nice if a baby was conceived here ? it really is a special place			0
