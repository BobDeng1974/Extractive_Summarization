@entity86 of @entity87 described yesterday ’s judgment as a ‘ significant development ’			0
he added : ‘ what is important about this ruling is not just that it might make it easier to succeed with this kind of claim in the future			0
‘ it might act as something of a temptation for cohabitees who had possibly not considered legal redress once their relationships break down			2
’ it could also give couples ‘ a reason to think again ’ about living together , added mr @entity86			2
‘ it has been ridiculous			0
the case has now cost me more than £ 100,000 , including my costs , just to give her £ 28,500			2

it could open the floodgates			0
