hiring in @entity1 firms might be strong , but do n't expect a pay raise anytime soon , says a new study			1
only 24 per cent of companies increased employees ' wages and salaries in the july - september quarter , a survey by the @entity10 found			1
this is compared to a much higher 43 per cent in the april - june quarter			1
the drop , the first after three straight increases , could be a sign that wage gains may remain weak in coming months			1
it comes as @entity1 firms continue to hire employees at a healthy pace , which usually pushes wages higher as employers compete for workers			1
a measure of hiring remained near a three - year high			2
do n't get your hopes up : @entity1 firms were much less likely to boost pay in the third quarter than in previous quarters , a study has found			1
it fell to just 24 per cent in july - september strong hiring : @entity1 firms continue to hire employees at a healthy pace , which usually pushes wages higher as employers compete for workers			1
a measure of hiring remained near a three - year high however , the figures suggest that the number of people out of work remains high enough that companies are not under any pressure to raise pay			1
despite healthy job gains this year , there were still 9.3 million people unemployed in september , according to government data			1
that 's up from 7.6 million before the @entity53			0
more than seven million @entity1 are working part - time but are looking for full - time work , which gives employers an even larger pool of potential employees to choose from			1
the @entity10 surveyed 76 of its member economists in late september			0
the economists work for companies or private trade associations			2
the survey revealed that just one - third of workers believe their companies will boost their wages in the october - december quarter , around the same proportion as three months ago			1
weaker sales and profits may have also made companies reluctant to boost pay			2
just 49 percent of respondents said their company 's sales rose in the third quarter , the smallest proportion in a year			0
out of work : the figures suggest that the number of people out of work remains high enough that companies are not under any pressure to raise pay			1
above , a file image of man filling in a job application profits also were squeezed , with 14 percent of firms reporting smaller profit margins			0
that was the largest proportion to do so in a year			0
the study also found that the economists were only modestly concerned about slower growth in @entity96			0
only 7 percent of firms said a slowdown there would have a significant negative effect			0
forty four percent said it would have a minor negative effect , 46 percent said it would have no impact and just 3 percent said it would have a minor positive effect			0
still , the survey was conducted before weak economic data from the region caused sharp drops in @entity1 stock markets in the past two weeks			2
searching for a job : despite healthy job gains this year , there were still 9.3 million people unemployed in september , according to government data			2
that 's up from 7.6 million before the @entity53 ( file image ) meanwhile , more than three - quarters of the economists surveyed said they expected the @entity121 to begin raising its benchmark short - term interest rate in the second quarter of 2015			0
but 84 percent said a small increase in rates in the short - term would n't hurt their businesses			0
and two - thirds of the firms said they were having no difficulty filling their open jobs , a good sign for hiring			2
government data shows that job openings are at the highest level in nearly 14 years			0
some economists worry that many of the unemployed do n't have the skills needed for the jobs that are available			0
but the @entity10 survey suggests that companies are mostly able to fill available jobs			0
this is also another likely reason why wages increases are becoming less common ; if companies were having more difficulty hiring workers , they might offer higher salaries .			2

only 24 per cent of @entity1 firms gave workers pay raises july - september
this is in comparison to much higher 43 per cent in april - june quarter
the drop could be sign that wage gains may remain weak in near *future*
but despite study findings , companies continue to hire at healthy pace
figures suggest that the number of people out of work remains high enough that businesses are not under any pressure to raise pay
