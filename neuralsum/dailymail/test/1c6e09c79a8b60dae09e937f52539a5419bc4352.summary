rip up a piece of paper , and you can piece it back together			0
burn a book , and you could theoretically do the same			0
but send information into a black hole , and it 's lost forever – or at least that 's what many physicists have been arguing for nearly half a decade			2
now , one scientist says this may not be true , and that interactions between particles emitted by a black hole can reveal information about what lies within			1
for nearly 40 years , physicists have argued that black holes suck in information and then evaporate without leaving behind any clues as to what they once contained			1
now , one scientist says this may not be true ' according to our work , information is n't lost once it enters a black hole , ' says @entity28 , an associate professor of physics at the @entity30			1
' it does n't just disappear			0
' his new paper presents explicit calculations demonstrating how information is preserved , he says			0
this is an important discovery because even physicists who believed information remains in black holes have struggled to show , mathematically , how this happens			1
the research marks a significant step toward solving the ' information loss paradox , ' a problem that has plagued physics for almost 40 years , says dr @entity28			1
the paradox posed a huge challenge for the field of physics because it meant that information inside a black hole could be permanently lost when the black hole disappeared			0
last year , @entity53 revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact ' grey '			1
the grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space in the 1970s , @entity53 proposed that black holes were capable of radiating particles , and that the energy lost through this process would cause the black holes to shrink and eventually disappear			1
but last year , @entity53 revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact ' grey ' the grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space			1
he says that the idea of an event horizon , from which light can not escape , is flawed			0
he suggests that instead light rays attempting to rush away from the black hole ’s core will be held as though stuck on a treadmill and that they can slowly shrink by spewing out radiation			0
@entity53 told the journal nature : ' there is no escape from a black hole in classical theory			2
[ but quantum theory ] enables energy and information to escape from a black hole '			2
a full explanation of the process , @entity53 admits , would require a theory that successfully merges gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature			2
this is a violation of quantum mechanics , which states that information must be conserved			1
in the 1970s , @entity53 proposed that black holes were capable of radiating particles , and that the energy lost through this process would cause the black holes to shrink and eventually disappear			1
but last year , @entity53 revised his theory by declaring that black holes were in fact ' grey ' the grey hole theory would allow matter and energy to be held for a period of time before being released back into space			1
how exactly it 's possible to recover information from a black hole has remained a topic of debate			2
instead of looking only at the particles a black hole emits , the latest study also takes into account the subtle interactions between the particles			0
interactions between particles can range from gravitational attraction to the exchange of mediators like photons between particles			0
such ' correlations ' have long been known to exist , but many scientists discounted them as unimportant in the past			0
' these correlations were often ignored in related calculations since they were thought to be small and not capable of making a significant difference , ' @entity28 says			0
' our explicit calculations show that though the correlations start off very small , they grow in time and become large enough to change the outcome			0

comments made by dr @entity28 from the @entity30
he says clues to contents lie in interactions between particles emitted
quantum mechanics states that information is always conserved
it backs up @entity53 's theory that black holes are ' grey '
