a @entity1 trophy winner who was permanently banned from keeping dogs after inspectors found more than 90 animals living in ' despicable conditions ' has moved to @entity7 where she will be able to own pets again			1
@entity10 , 62 , who clinched second place in the yearling bitch category at @entity1 in 2007 with an @entity14 cocker spaniel , kept animals in squalor at @entity17 and @entity18 home near @entity20			1
she was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the needs of her animals and was also handed a lifetime ban on keeping animals in @entity26 and @entity27 following a court case in october 2010			1
the woman - who now uses the name @entity40 - has already been reported to the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) by concerned dog lovers who claims she is seen with the dog on a daily basis			1
a spokesman for the @entity41 confirmed it had investigated the claims but is satisfied that the dog is owned by ms @entity10 's relative			1
but a spokesman for the @entity51 , which successfully applied for the ban , said ms @entity10 would not be flouting the ban by keeping an animal because it does not apply in @entity7			1
they said : ' provision was made during the formation of the @entity57 under section 46 that banning orders would cover @entity7 , as well as @entity26 and @entity27			2
' however , this section was never implemented at the time the @entity57 was passed , and so that means the ban does not apply to @entity7			1
' this is one of the neglected dogs found at the pets ' home in @entity20 which was owned by the former @entity1 trophy winner when inspectors arrived at ms @entity10 's property , the @entity51 seized 63 dogs , 25 cats , two rabbits and two birds			1
more than a third of the dogs needed to be sedated to be ' de-matted '			0
in one case the matting accounted for more than a quarter of the dog 's original weight			2
each dog took two veterinary nurses an average of three hours to de- mat. many had breathing problems caused by the ' overpowering ' stench			0
one dog 's eye was so badly infected it had to be removed â€“ another lost 26 teeth			2
most of the cats had ear mites and fleas , and two had feline aids , the @entity51 said			0
animals were emaciated and their coats were caked with urine and faeces from being kept in cramped cages and pens which had not been cleaned for ' weeks if not months '			0
@entity51 inspector @entity101 said after the case : ' i 've never seen as many animals living in such horrendous conditions in all my time working for the @entity51			0
' i hope the sentence will ensure no further animals suffer because of ms @entity10			1
' @entity10 now lives in a quiet part of @entity109 a few hundred yards from her elderly and frail stepmother , @entity111			2
eye witnesses have seen her with a poodle in her car , going in and out of her house and her relative 's property			1
there is also a dogbed in the back of her blue @entity121 and various dog and cat ornaments on her doorstep			0
she refused to comment on the lifetime ban or even confirm there was one in place			0
inspectors found animals emaciated , while their coats were caked with urine and faeces from being kept in cramped cages which the court heard had not been cleaned for ' weeks if not months ' at first , she also denied she had a dog , but then said : ' that is my stepmother 's dog			1
' but one eye - witness and dog lover @entity140 said : ' i am visiting my mother on a daily basis and see this woman almost every day , going from her house to her stepmum 's house with the dog			1
' she stays a little while and then leaves with the dog			0
' she ca n't be going to the vet every day			0
there is no doubt in my mind she is keeping the dog			0
' this has been happening for around six months now			0
' what is the point of a lifetime ban if she is still allowed to be near animals			2
' @entity41 chief inspector @entity160 said : ' we have received complaints relating to a woman residing in @entity109 who is allegedly breaching a ban on owning animals which was imposed in @entity26			1
' after investigating it is our understanding that the dog does not belong to her			0
' the woman advised she has been transporting the dog to and from the vets for her mother as she is unable to , and we have confirmed this with the vet			2
' we are satisfied the dog is being well looked after and have no concerns at this stage			0
we will continue to monitor the situation			0
