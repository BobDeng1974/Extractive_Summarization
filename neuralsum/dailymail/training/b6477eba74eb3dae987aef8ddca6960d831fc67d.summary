@entity1 women are being trafficked to @entity2 hoping for a better life – but often end up working the streets as prostitutes			1
their plight has been highlighted by @entity8 - based photographer @entity7 , originally from @entity2 , who began to notice the presence of young @entity11 women working on the streets during her commutes from @entity14			1
she said : ' i decided to start from this surreal vision to tell a story			0
i have been working on the topic for several years , focusing mainly on the @entity2 connection			0

traffickers demand on average more than 50,000 euros ( us $ 60,000 ) for travel expenses and accommodation , with the women having to work as prostitutes until their debts are paid off			1
as @entity54 , former official of the @entity55 , explained : ' the women are still coming : they are younger than ever and arrive here with massive debts to pay off			1
' they are forced into prostitution and are now increasingly reinventing themselves as madams or working for the traffickers , also trafficking men , children for adoptions and organs and drug dealing			2
' these are the activities of the powerful @entity1 mafia , which is also involved in arms dealing			2
what has changed is that the madams are now less violent towards the girls , having understood that if they mistreat them the girls run away : the girls forced into the sex industry now get to keep a little of the money they earn and this makes their lives a little bit more tolerable			2
' as they can not find a real way out , they get used to life as prostitutes and prostitution becomes their only source of income			0
