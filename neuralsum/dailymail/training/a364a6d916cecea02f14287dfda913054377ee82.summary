by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 18:48 est , 9 june 2012 the sequence lasted only two minutes , but the transformation of @entity3 into rows of flats , terraces and council blocks - as @entity8 played their hit @entity10 - was one of the more original and intriguing parts of the @entity13			1
the effect , seen by 17 million tv viewers , was achieved by a clever light show - and the images projected on to the @entity3 were of real homes lived in by ordinary people			2
we tracked down some of the buildings and showed photographs of the tv images to people who live there			0
most were surprised - and delighted - to learn of their unexpected moment of fame			0
the sequence opened with an image of a @entity32 council block - in reality a neglected three - storey block of flats in @entity35 , @entity36			1
light show : the neglected @entity35 council block is beamed onto @entity3 during @entity8 set @entity41 - born @entity40 , 45 , a restaurant manager who has a flat on the ground floor , saw the designers had cleverly used blue and red lights to disguise the block 's crumbling white plaster and paintwork			1
' it 's amazing , ' said mr @entity40 , who did n't recognise his home , even though he was actually in @entity51 at the concert			1
the image of the flats in @entity55 was used three times in the show and mr @entity40 was so excited that he immediately broke the news to his girlfriend @entity59 , 27 , a chambermaid , originally from @entity60 , adding : ' i 'm going to tell all my family and friends			1
' flat screen : the image of the flats in @entity55 was used three times as @entity8 played on the palace roof a couple of miles away , a @entity67 block on the @entity69 estate in @entity70 was used to depict an inner - city estate			2
the animators made it look grittier by daubing the front with graffiti			0
single mother @entity77 , 28 , who has a two - bedroom flat there , said : ' i 'm really pleased			0
i thought the housing looked a bit like mine but had no idea it was			0
' the light show was created by specialist firm @entity86 , and designed to highlight the communities that make up @entity88			0
other housing was based on internet pictures of the @entity92 council block in @entity93 , the terrace in tv 's @entity95 , and a @entity98 terrace in @entity99 , @entity36			2
surprised : @entity40 , with partner @entity59 , did not recognise his flat even though he was in the mall			1

restaurant manager @entity40 did not recognise his @entity36 home during @entity8 set despite being among the crowd in @entity51
