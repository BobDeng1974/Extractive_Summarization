prosecutor @entity42 said : ' the damage caused was extensive			0
the financial damage is put at around £ 17,000 pounds			0
devastated : the gutted dwelling was built by volunteers who spent hundreds of hours of their own time constructing the home which showed how people lived between 800 @entity27 and the @entity29 invasion in 43 ad ' the building had been constructed by members of the community and had taken many hours of voluntary work			0
' the insured value was nothing compared to the hours of work which people had put in to the project			0
