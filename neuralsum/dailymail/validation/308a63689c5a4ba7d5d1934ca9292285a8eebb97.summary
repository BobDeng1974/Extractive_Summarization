the @entity0 confirmed on monday that president @entity1 knew about @entity3 's private email address because he emailed her at it during her tenure of secretary of state			1
when @entity1 said in an interview that aired sunday that he found out @entity3 used a private email account to conduct official business at ' the same time as everybody else learned it through news reports , ' what he meant was that was the first he 'd heard of her exclusive use of use of personal email and of her private server , his spokesman clarified this afternoon			1
' the president , as i think many people expected , did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state , ' @entity0 spokesman @entity19 told reporters			2
' i would not describe the number of emails as large , but they did have the occasion to email each other			0
' i 'm glad that @entity3 's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed , ' @entity1 said			1
' i think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need , ' ' the policy of my administration is to encourage transparency , which is why my emails , the @entity62 i carry around , all those records are available and archived , ' @entity1 said			0
@entity3 , seen as the front - runner for the @entity66 's presidential nomination in 2016 , said on wednesday she wanted the @entity68 to publish her emails so that the public could read them			1
pressed by reporters to acknowledge that the president had in fact emailed his secretary of state during her four - year tenure , his spokesman said monday , ' the point that the president was making is not that he did n’t know secretary @entity3 ’s email address , he did			1
' ' but he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how @entity3 and her team were planning to comply with the @entity85 , ' @entity19 explained			1
@entity19 said he did not know when the @entity0 's @entity86 first knew of @entity3 's private email and server system			1
' it is the responsibility of individual agencies to establish an email system and to make sure those emails as created are properly recorded and maintained , ' he again told reporters during the briefing , standing by his statements from last week			0
he also stuck by the @entity0 's stance that there 's no ' reason to doubt ' that @entity3 's team has not done ' exactly what they said they would do ' and give the @entity68 a copy of all of her work - related emails			1
' but ultimately that is the responsibility of @entity3 and her team , ' he said			0
responding to a question about a @entity109 's investigation into the 2012 assault on the @entity112 consulate in @entity113 and committee chair @entity115 's suspicions that @entity3 may be withholding pertinent emails , @entity19 challenged the reporter or @entity115 , a @entity119 @entity118 , to produce evidence of foul play			2
and if @entity115 ' has specific questions about specific emails that should be produced in response to a legitimate congressional inquiry , then he should raise that directly with @entity68 officials , @entity19 said			0
asked by the same reporter , @entity128 's @entity127 , if the @entity0 feels it now needs to step in because the @entity68 ' does n't seem to be doing its job , ' @entity19 said that was ' one step too far			2
' the @entity68 has cooperated at ' great length ' with the eight committees have investigated the @entity113 terrorist attack , he contended			0
moments later , he again went after @entity115 , saying , he ' would hazard a guess that if the @entity0 were intimately involved in that kind of effort to review email and make determinations about what should be provided to @entity141 , that he 'd be complaining about that on national television as well			0
' the growing controversy over @entity3 's use of personal email for work while she was @entity112 secretary of state threatens to cloud the expected launch of her campaign			1
a senior @entity68 official told @entity154 last thursday that a review of her emails would not happen quickly			2
' the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set , ' the official said			0
the @entity68 has said there was no prohibition during @entity3 's tenure on using personal email for official business as long as it was preserved			1
a total of 55,000 pages of documents covering the time @entity3 was in office has been turned over , according to the @entity68			2
but @entity3 and her aides controlled that process , and the emails were not archived on government servers			0
transparency : the president applauded the front - runner for the 2016 @entity66 nominee for saying she would release the emails following criticism			0

@entity1 said in an interview that he learned @entity3 used a private email account to conduct official business at ' the same time as everybody else '
' the point that the president was making is not that he did n’t know secretary @entity3 ’s email address , he did , ' @entity1 's spokesman said
' but he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how @entity3 '
@entity1 said he was glad @entity3 wanted her emails to be released and *praised* the job she did at the @entity68
the controversy threatens to *overshadow* @entity3 's expected presidential campaign
