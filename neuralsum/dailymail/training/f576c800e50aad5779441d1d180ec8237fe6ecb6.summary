by @entity0 from columns that shake , to waves of colours and rotating snakes , these optical illusions should not be viewed if you 've just eaten			0
each stomach - churning design was created by a former animal psychologist who became fascinated by the illusions when he studied monkeys in a neuroscience institute			1
they are so powerful that each image comes with a health warning , and if you start to feel dizzy or sick cover one eye and look away - do n’t close your eyes completely			1
the professor devised the @entity27 illusion ( pictured ) in 2003 , which comes with a warning on his website , due to the feeling of nausea it could cause some viewers optical illusions use colour , light and patterns to create images that deceive or mislead the brain			1
the information collected by the eye is processed by the brain			0
in the process of converting what it sees , the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and patterns			0
this creates a perception that does n't match the image , and confuses the brain			0
this is because the illusions can become more prominent , and the effect worsens , when eyes are closed completely			2
the images were created by professor @entity19 , from @entity20 , in @entity22			1
the 52 - year - old has spent more than a decade creating his collection either from scratch , or by developing existing designs			1
the professor also devised the @entity27 illusion in 2003 , which comes with a warning on his website due to the feeling of nausea it can cause some viewers			1
this image is called @entity74 and it looks like rollers printed with blue dots turning towards each other in a line			0
each design is either created through a process of trial and error , or based on illusion experiments of the past			1
professor @entity19 began designing the images in the mid- 90s , and has created hundreds of different designs professor @entity19 ’s @entity90 image ( pictured ) features rows of circles that look like they ’re increasing in size and coming towards the viewer			1

in the process of converting what it sees , the brain tries to make sense of the different colours and @entity111 creates a perception that does n't match the image , and confuses the brain in @entity117 ( pictured ) the central ring of squares rotates anticlockwise as the outer circles of squares move slowly clockwise			0
having originally studied animal psychology , professor @entity19 , 52 , decided to focus on optical illusions after looking into their effect on monkeys , while working at a neuroscience institute all of his designs stem from professor @entity19 's interest in the brain 's interpretation of signals from the eyes			1

he began designing the images in the mid- 90s , and has since created hundreds of different illusions			1
irrigation ( pictured ) works in a similar way to the @entity148 image			0
it appears as if rows of seeds are being moved through rollers this image , called @entity154 , features rows that appear to move diagonally , especially when viewed in a person 's peripheral vision			0
though more straightforward experiments , such as the eye 's interpretation of the colour , are important to science , the professor said that the public generally prefer his more artist works optical illusions , which were extremely popular during the @entity168 movement of the 1960s , create the feeling that a motionless image is somehow moving			2
in this image , called @entity173 , the columns of red dots appear to move up and down on the blue background and at times look like they 're shaking all of the designs stem from professor @entity19 's interest in the brain 's interpretation of signals from the eyes			1
in this image , called @entity187 , the yellow rings on the purple background appear to move towards each other optical illusions , which were extremely popular during the @entity168 movement of the 1960s , create the feeling that a motionless image is somehow moving			0
however , professor @entity19 posts a caution on his website for anyone who feels sick : ‘ some of the pictures on this website can cause dizziness or might possibly epileptic seizures			1
‘ the latter happens when the brain ca n't handle the conflicting information from your two eyes			2
‘ if you start feeling unwell when using this website , immediately cover one eye with your hand and then leave the page			2
‘ do not close your eyes because that can make the attack worse			1
’ in one image , called @entity214 , yellow circles on a purple background appear to move towards each other			0
similarly , pink columns of spots on a blue background in the image called @entity173 appear to move up and down			0
professor @entity19 ’s @entity90 image features rows of circles that look like they ’re increasing in size and coming towards the viewer - a similar experience is seen in his @entity117 image			1
in @entity230 , the inner circle rotates , and in @entity232 the screen looks as if it ’s a piece of paper being moved up and down			0
@entity234 is the only black and white image in the collection , and it has been designed to look like the central circle is protruding from the background			0
the most colourful images , known as @entity240 and @entity241 , resemble the @entity243 pictures of the 1990s			0
in the former , squares move around the centre of the image , while the latter looks like a picnic blanket blowing in the wind			0
meanwhile , @entity74 looks like rows of seeds being moved through rollers			0
one of the professor 's most recent experiments looks at a basic illusion - how veins appear blue to a human , but , at best , they are actually a very light great on the colour spectrum			0
though more straightforward experiments , such as the eye 's interpretation of the colour , are important to science , the professor said the public generally prefer his more artist works			0
the 52 - year - old has spent more than a decade creating his collection either from scratch , or by developing existing designs			1
in this image , called @entity230 , the inner circle rotates as the outer circle stays still one of the most colourful images in the collection is @entity241 , ( pictured ) which resembles a picnic blanket blowing in the wind professor @entity19 said : ‘ i love every work , but @entity281 seems to be the favourite among most people			1
‘ i became interested in optical illusions when i worked at a neuroscience institute , twelve years ago			2
‘ some of my works come from trial and error , whereas others are logical progressions of previous designs			1
‘ my optical illusion works are people 's favourites , but the other , more basic illusion images [ how something appears one colour , but is actually another , for example ] do not get so much attention			2
’ meanwhile , @entity240 ( pictured ) resembles the @entity243 images of the 1990s and features squares that move in the centre of the design @entity234 ( pictured ) is the only black and white image in the collection , and it has been designed to look like the central circle is protruding from the background			2

the illusions were created by professor @entity19 from the @entity20 , in @entity21 , @entity22
he has spent more than a decade creating illusions using trial and error , or by *adapting* existing designs
the animal psychologist ’s interest in the illusions began when he studied how the designs affect monkeys
his website comes with a health warning about dizziness , sickness and epileptic seizures caused by the illusions
professor @entity19 *advises* people do n’t close their eyes when looking at the images as it can ‘ make the attack worse ’
