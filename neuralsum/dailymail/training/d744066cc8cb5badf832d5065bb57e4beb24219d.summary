@entity2 anchor @entity1 ' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during @entity5 is drawing fresh skepticism in the wake of his own admission on wednesday that he lied about being aboard a helicopter that was hit by enemy fire during the @entity12 war			1
despite a swift apology on his @entity14 , @entity1 is at the center of a media firestorm after it emerged that his old war story that he has retold numerous times over the past 12 years has become increasingly exaggerated			1
@entity1 was forced to apologize this week after claiming in a report on friday that the chinook he was aboard in @entity12 had been hit by enemy fire			1
the anchor 's previous credibility as a highly regarded journalist is based partly on his reporting from inside the @entity42 in the immediate aftermath of @entity5 in september 2005			2
the major story broke just months after @entity1 replaced @entity45 as @entity2 ' anchor and his reporting from the devastation of @entity27 received countless plaudits and helped earn @entity2 a @entity50			1
in the wake of the scandal over @entity55 's war story apology , attention is now turning to comments he made about what exactly he witnessed in @entity27 in the aftermath of @entity5			1
' when you look out of your hotel room window in the @entity26 and watch a man float by face down , when you see bodies that you last saw in @entity65 , @entity66 and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country ... i beat that storm			2
i was there before it arrived			0
' i rode it out with people who later died in the @entity42 , ' he said in an interview in 2006 , just a year after the hurricane			0
the story was first broken by the @entity79 news blog			0
@entity1 ' reporting from @entity27 received countless plaudits and helped earn @entity2 a @entity50 but is now being reevaluated with some skepticism following his @entity12 war story climb down according to the @entity27 advocate , @entity1 claim is n't accurate as the @entity26 of the city – one of the highest parts of the city – was never flooded			1
@entity85 has also taken @entity1 to task over another @entity5 - related claim that he made in an interview last year with her predecessor @entity45			2
in the interview @entity1 claims that he had caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters during his stay in @entity27			1
' my week , two weeks there was not helped by the fact that i accidentally ingested some of the floodwater , ' he said			0
' i became very sick with dysentery , our hotel was overrun with gangs , i was rescued in the stairwell of a five - star hotel in @entity27 by a young police officer			0
we are friends to this day			0
and uh , it just was uh , i look back at total agony			0
' those claims have also had cold water poured on them			0
the anchor is also in trouble over claims that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters while reporting on the aftermath of @entity5 in @entity27 in 2005 ' i saw a lot of people with cuts and bruises and such , but i do n't recall a single , solitary case of gastroenteritis during @entity5 or in the whole month afterward , ' dr. @entity123 , a former city health director told the @entity85			1
a spokeswoman from the @entity131 said contaminated water sources are a possible ' transmission points ' for dysentery , but that the agency does n't track it			0
elsewhere , conservative blog , @entity138 , posted video clips on thursday that apparently showed @entity1 telling two completely different stories about a @entity27 man who committed suicide during the @entity5			2
one clip from the @entity146 interview has @entity1 claim that he personally witnessed the death , while in a second clip , @entity1 said he ' heard the story of a man killing himself falling from the upper deck ' of the @entity42			0
in the same interview with @entity45 , he praised @entity153 , saying that with his reporting during @entity5 , @entity1 ' took ownership , if you will , of the anchor chair ' following a longtime stint as @entity45 's understudy			2
in a 2014 interview with @entity45 , right , @entity1 claimed that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters in @entity27 - a claim that experts have said is highly unlikely			1

@entity1 ' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during @entity5 is drawing fresh skepticism
the @entity2 anchor was forced to apologize on wednesday after he lied about being on a helicopter in @entity12 in 2003 that was hit by enemy fire
he blamed that mistake on the ' fog of memory over 12 years '
@entity55 's @entity5 claim is now being questioned and is also likely to be false as the @entity26 was never flooded following the hurricane
the anchor is also in trouble over claims that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters
his reporting from @entity27 received countless plaudits and helped earn @entity2 a @entity50
