fears are rising that the deadly ebola virus could be on its way to @entity3 after experts warned it could spread into the @entity3 through meat			1
professors said ‘ bush meat ’ which has been smuggled into @entity3 could be carrying the virus , which has already killed at least 672 people in @entity9			1
one scientist said the meat could ‘ end up in a market stall in @entity13 ’ as authorities across the country remained on high alert for the killer disease			1
doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers will not be allowed on flights to the @entity3 if they are unwell it is feared the bug , which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims , could have contaminated the thousands of pieces of meat which are smuggled into the @entity3 and sold illegally to butchers and markets each year			1
while the meat is often disguised as beef , it is often found to actually be the meat of wild animals such as rat , chimpanzee or antelope			2
professor @entity48 , an expert in infectious diseases at @entity50 , told @entity51 : ‘ lots of wild animals carry the virus , and bush meat is often badly prepared			1
‘ similar meat that could have caused this outbreak may well end up in a market stall in @entity13			2
’ humans can contract @entity60 from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees , fruit bats , forest antelopes and porcupines			2
of the 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat that enters the country every year , 55 per cent is said to be ' bush meat ' , which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets			1
the latest warning comes as @entity3 airports and airlines remain on high alert to prevent travellers bringing the deadly virus back to the @entity3			1
the latest outbreak of @entity60 , which began in february , is the most severe since the disease was discovered in 1976			1
so far the disease has spread from a village in @entity81 to @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity9 @entity86 citizen @entity85 ( pictured with his daughter @entity87 ) died in the @entity84 capital of @entity89 after becoming infected with @entity60			1
his death has prompted fears of a global pandemic after he flew from @entity83 to @entity84 measures are in place to ensure that passengers showing symptoms of the bug are barred from boarding flights heading to the @entity3			1
anyone who appears ill on arrival into @entity3 will be held at immigration before being quarantined in highly secure isolation units , such as those at the @entity104 in @entity13			2
however , because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear , there are fears some victims will slip through the net			0
nearly 7,500 tons of illegal meat enters @entity3 each year – including cuts from exotic animals disguised as beef			1
the charity @entity115 says animals from all over @entity9 , from giraffe to zebra , and even endangered species such as gorillas and elephants , are snared by poachers , butchered , and then transported to city markets and restaurants across the globe			2
@entity127 meat is also smuggled into the @entity3 hidden in suitcases by @entity130 travellers visiting relatives			1
favoured delicacies include fruit bats the size of a small cat , antelope and cane rats			0
much will be dried or smoked but some will be raw and could carry infections such as @entity60 or @entity140			0
in 2012 , an undercover investigation by the @entity142 revealed cane rats and ‘ smokies ’ – charred skin - on sheep or goat meat – on sale in a north - east @entity13 market			0
a year earlier , trading standards officers in the @entity151 seized chimpanzee meat believed to be destined for restaurants			0
doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from @entity9 are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu - like symptoms			2
one of the deadliest diseases known to man , @entity60 has already claimed more than 672 lives in its worst - ever outbreak			1
for the first time , the virus has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities , raising fears it will reach @entity3			1
it can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure			1
@entity60 ( above ) has already killed 672 people in @entity81 , @entity83 , @entity82 and @entity84 and infected more than 1,200 since it was first diagnosed in february			1
symptoms include sudden fever , vomiting and headaches medical staff at a clinic on the outskirts of @entity184 , @entity82 have been treating patients with @entity60			0
@entity83 president @entity186 has closed some border crossings and ordered strict quarantines of patients foreign secretary @entity190 , who chaired a meeting of the government ’s @entity193 emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday , said @entity60 was a ‘ very serious threat ’			2
but he sought to calm fears , saying it is ‘ most unlikely ’ that @entity60 could spread within the @entity3 because of ‘ frankly different ’ standards of infection control here			1
he said the logical approach was to tackle the outbreak at its source in @entity9 , adding : ‘ we do not , at the moment , think this is an issue that affects the @entity3 directly			1
’ health secretary @entity207 said the @entity208 was looking at its capability and taking ‘ precautionary measures ’ but he was ‘ very confident ’ it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the @entity3			1
the outbreak started in @entity81 in february and spread to neighbouring @entity83 and @entity82 within weeks			0
@entity215 medical staff had to spray disinfectant on a person who died from @entity60 in @entity218 , @entity83 health workers in protective gear carry a victim of the @entity60 outbreak in @entity223 , @entity83 fears grew last week that it could spread internationally following the death of an @entity86 finance consultant in the @entity84 city of @entity230 ’s biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub			1
@entity85 , 40 , had been on his way back to the @entity86 after attending the funeral of his sister in @entity83			0
she had also died from the disease			0
the @entity237 has confirmed it is prepared for a potential outbreak in the @entity3 , saying ‘ the government is confident the @entity3 has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here ’			1
it added : ‘ we have experienced scientists and doctors – the @entity249 , the @entity250 and the @entity251 – and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases			0
the risk of this disease spreading fast in the @entity3 is much lower because of that			1
’ what is @entity60 ? @entity60 is a virus that causes a potentially lethal illness called hemorrhagic fever			2
this makes the body ’s blood vessels porous and they start to leak , causing catastrophic internal bleeding			0
up to nine out of ten people who contract the virus will die without immediate medical attention			0
the virus emerged in 1976 in an isolated village near the @entity268 in the @entity269			0
why is the government suddenly worried ? foreign secretary @entity190 chaired an emergency cobra meeting on the issue yesterday because there are growing fears that the virus could enter @entity3 from @entity9			1
the latest outbreak in @entity9 is the worst on record – killing more than 670 people – and is also the first to affect people in cities and not just remote villages			1
in @entity81 , the epidemic has reached the capital , @entity283			0
what are the symptoms ? dr @entity286 of the @entity287 , who has treated victims in @entity81 and @entity82 , says : ‘ the initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu - like illness			0
they include fever , headache and lethargy			0
this progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting			0
’ the incubation period for the virus varies from two days to three weeks			0
have there been any cases in @entity3 ? no. but dr @entity301 , a virologist from the @entity302 who studies viruses such as @entity60 , warns that it is statistically likely the virus will eventually come to the @entity3			1
the most immediate danger is that the virus will enter @entity3 on an airline flight			2
one victim , @entity86 @entity85 , had symptoms of the virus in @entity83 but was allowed to board multiple international flights			0
vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea , he flew from @entity83 , stopped over in @entity311 , changed planes in @entity313 and died in @entity84			0
what is the connection with bush meat ? @entity127 meat refers to any meat obtained from wild animals killed in rainforests			1
it is thought humans can contract @entity60 from eating or handling infected meat from chimpanzees , fruit bats , forest antelopes and porcupines			1
there are fears that smuggled bush meat might be a route for the virus into @entity3 – 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters the country every year , and 55 per cent is said to be bush meat , which is then distributed through wholesalers or at local markets			1
how contagious is it ? it is less contagious than other diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis , which can spread for considerable distances through the air			0
dr @entity286 said : ‘ @entity60 does not spread through the air			2
to contract it , you must have contact with an infected person ’s blood or other bodily fluids , so the real risk is to family members and care givers			0
’ should i worry ? ‘ the risk of anyone in @entity3 contracting @entity60 is very small , ’ stresses dr @entity356 , an expert in viral infection , who is the director of the newly established @entity358			2
he adds : ‘ if the outbreak in @entity9 is not brought under control , then that would increase the risk to people here			2
’ what if i think i have been in contact with an infected person ? contact your gp immediately , although the health authorities are keen to avoid everyone who has flown from @entity9 rushing to their family doctor because it will overwhelm surgeries			0
if a passenger on a flight is identified as being infected with the virus , every other passenger on that flight will be contacted			0
how can the disease be treated ? there is no cure for @entity60 , although scientists across the world are working to develop treatments such as antiviral drugs			2
other scientific teams are carrying out studies on antibodies – the body ’s immune defence cells – from people who have recovered from the infection and have antibodies in their bodies that may neutralise the virus			2
‘ many people do survive , ’ says dr @entity286			0
‘ treatment with drugs such as antibiotics and fluids given through intravenous drips can make a great difference			0
loss of fluids is often a killer in @entity60 cases			0
up to half of patients can survive , if treated properly			0
