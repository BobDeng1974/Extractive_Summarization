by @entity0 @entity0 weighed 16st 5lb after too many sandwiches , crisps and lager in 2011 i took a selfie which saved my life			1
it ’s a truly horrible image showing the full extent of my 16st 5lb body , featuring a distended gut topped with the sort of boobs that could make a pre-teen girl wince with envy			2
i took the guttie to send to a friend as a laugh , but when i contemplated the image the full extent of my issues with weight hit me			2
i had no idea that the mission would ultimately include thousands more gutties , the launch of a new magazine called @entity26 and even gained support from @entity28			2
my weight had initially suffered when i was working hard on building my business and balancing the demands of being a dad to two lovely boys , while trying to squeeze a bit of a life in at the sides			0
the stress of work was leading to a procession familiar to many working types where i trudged from bed , to desk , to sofa and back to bed			0
my food choices were geared towards comfort and the temporary alleviation of tiredness			0
my four food groups were sandwiches , crisps , chocolate and lager			0
all of this was playing havoc with my health – i had developed atrial fibrillation ( an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to a higher chance of having a stroke ) , i no longer played sport and my confidence was in tatters			0
something about the guttie cut through all of that though – it left me with nowhere to run – i knew i had to change			0
the thing that i was n’t prepared for is that according to the weight loss industry : men do n’t diet			1
no matter how hard i looked i could n’t find anything that was aimed at helping me : a normal , fat bloke who just wanted to get some no - nonsense advice about how to lose weight			1
the diets , the magazines , the weight loss groups were all women only			1
what i saw was an industry that has simply jettisoned the notion that men – half of the market – might want to lose weight			1
the gut selfie that triggered his weight loss ( left ) and another as he began to lose it			1
he blamed his 16st 5lb frame on ' too many sandwiches , crisps and lager ' he said : i lost ' weight slowly , by making more and more healthy choices			0
i learned about nutrition and the science behind weight loss			1
' the @entity98 is a man precisely because the notion of a man dieting is anathema to the weight loss industry			1
i did join several weight loss classes , but as the token man in a class of 30 women there ’s only so many times you can hear about how menstruation affects your weekly weigh - ins before realising that you ’re not the target market			1
what i learned is that rather than diet , men get fit			0
instead of advice about what foods to cut down on and how to make really tasty , healthy food i was bombarded with messages about how i could get a six pack , build bigger arms and perfect my deadlift form			0
all of this wildly overlooked the fact that at 40 per cent body fat i was far more likely to be drinking a six - pack than seriously contemplating developing one			2
i began to wonder how many other men out there were being led down the same cul - de - sac that i was and finding that their hopes to simply shift a bit of weight were being met with the unrealistic expectation that they tone up , rather than slim down			2
all of this would n’t be such an issue if the scale of men ’s weight problems was n’t so vast			1
in the @entity141 alone we have over 20.4 million men who are overweight or obese			0
some figures suggest that by 2030 over half of all men in the @entity141 will be obese			0
today , he weighs 13st and having discovered on his weight loss journey there are few resources to help the ' average bloke ' lose weight , decided to launch a free weight loss magazine this is the single biggest public health issue that we can actually do something about – millions of lives can be saved and immeasurably improved simply by providing more support			1
every year the @entity159 is faced with a £ 6 billion bill for illnesses related to weight – more than the cost of illnesses related to smoking and drinking			2
lord @entity166 , a former professor at @entity167 , has warned that the obesity epidemic will shortly bankrupt the @entity159			0
despite all of this we continue to leave men dangling in the wind			0
i lost weight slowly , by making more and more healthy choices			0
i learned about nutrition and the science behind weight loss			1
what stunned me was that it was so simple ! how could an entire industry have been built up around the indisputable scientific fact that you lose weight by expending more energy than you take in ? and yet there it was – a baffling array of approaches , products , quick - fixes , no - effort cures and out - and - out quackery – but still i could n’t find anything to help men			1
the first issue of @entity26 is out on may 5th			0
the magazine was a crowdfunded project once i ’d lost nearly 50lb i felt like a new man – i was no longer embarrassed of my gutties and i had started to enjoy yoga and boot camps at my local gym			2
i could n’t ignore the fact that men were being abandoned though and so a new business was born : man @entity26 – a free digital magazine that supports and champions weight loss in men			1
i was n’t sure if there would be enough public demand for it so i set up a crowdfunding project and when we cruised past our £ 9,000 target and got support from @entity28 , the @entity216 and the @entity217 , i realised that this was a project whose time had come			0
we ’ve already had thousands of subscribers before the first issue has even launched – you can get your free copy simply by adding your details here @entity226			2
the first issue is out on may 5th and it contains all you need to lose weight if you are a man and avoid ever having to take a guttie of your own @entity229			1

@entity0 , *36* , took a picture of his gut for a joke
but after looking at the picture , he was *horrified* at how fat he was
went on to lose 3st *6lb* after teaching himself about nutrition
on the way , discovered there is no support for men wanting to lose weight
launches man @entity246 – a free men ’s weight loss magazine - on may 5th
