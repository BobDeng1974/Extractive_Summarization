@entity0 produced one of the greatest @entity2 upsets to send champions @entity4 tumbling out of the tournament 5 - 4 on penalties after their quarter - final finished 1 - 1 after extra time on friday			1
after @entity4 's @entity10 had missed the first sudden - death spot kick , defender @entity9 nervelessly converted the decisive penalty to send his team into a last four meeting with hosts @entity15 on tuesday			1
the winner of that semi-final in @entity19 will meet @entity20 or @entity21 to decide the continental champions back at @entity15 on january 31			0
@entity4 crashed out of the @entity2 after losing to @entity0 on penalties @entity24 reacts after sending his penalty over the bar during the penalty shootout @entity30 playmaker @entity28 smashed @entity4 's opening penalty into the stands @entity4 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 54 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 46 ) , @entity10 , @entity43 ( @entity44 65 ) , @entity28 subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 goal : @entity56 81 @entity0 : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity9 76 ) , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 54 ) , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 58 ) , @entity69 goal : @entity71 7 booked : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity66 , @entity9 substitute @entity39 had earlier saved the blushes of the @entity4 by equalising nine minutes from the end of normal time after @entity69 had given the @entity76 nation an early lead with his fourth goal of the tournament			1
@entity69 's powerful shot into the corner of the net after seven minutes was the first goal @entity4 had conceded in @entity15 , stunning the blue - shirted , drum - thumping band of their supporters behind the goal into a rare silence			2
@entity4 have not won the @entity2 four times in the last six tournaments by panicking , though , and they continued to press forward after the goal with the neat inter-passing game that won them three from three in the group stage			0
as they had in those games , however , @entity4 failed to convert possession into clear - cut chances , @entity99 wasting the best of them in the first half by directing his far post header straight at goalkeeper @entity57			2
@entity4 had kept danger man @entity63 quiet before half - time but the languid midfielder nearly helped his side double the lead four minutes after the break with a delightful flick into the box that mabkhout just failed to control			1
former @entity110 attacking midfielder @entity10 looks despondent after missing a penalty @entity99 had been replaced by @entity42 during the interval and the substitute had two chances to make a quick impression but flashed a shot wide before also failing to hit the target with a free header			0
that set the template for the next half an hour of the match			0
the @entity0 goal was under almost permanent siege but a combination of stout defending and misfiring @entity4 forwards kept the underdogs ahead until @entity39 lashed the ball into the net from the edge of the area after a one - two with @entity24			1
having been handed a lifeline , @entity4 looked determined to finish the tie in normal time but continued to waste a string of chances and the profligacy continued into a strangely passionless extra half an hour			0
@entity28 sent the opening spot kick high over the bar but @entity142 the same with the the @entity0 's third penalty and the shootout went to sudden death .			0

@entity0 produced a major upset by defeating @entity4
the two sides could not be split after *120* minutes of action
@entity4 *duo* @entity10 and @entity24 failed to score from the spot
