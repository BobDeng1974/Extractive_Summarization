by @entity1 reporter published : 05:02 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 18 june 2013 a farm field overlooking the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , is believed to be where @entity6 interceded with her powerful father @entity8 to rescue captain @entity9 from death			1
the story goes that just as the great chief lifted his war club to carry out the execution , his young daughter laid her head on the @entity19 explorer 's to protect him			1
but that 's a fanciful footnote for many @entity21 , historians and archaeologists , who say the real story is that this land was the centre of a complex , sprawling empire ruled by @entity8 long before the first permanent @entity19 settlement on @entity31 soil was founded in 1607			1
it was called @entity33 , which roughly translates to a ' place of chiefs			2
' pocahontas saving the life of captain @entity9 : this image provided by the @entity40 illustrates the tale of the @entity43 princess			2
archaeologists say they have found the capital of her father 's empire ' this is like our @entity50 , ' said @entity52 , chief of the @entity54 tribe			1
' @entity55 did n't begin in 1607 and there are a lot of people who overlook that			2
' on loan to archaeologists for more than a decade , these 57 privately owned acres will be preserved forever under an agreement years in the making and to be officially announced on friday			2
the deal is important for @entity66 because they believe their story has been overshadowed for centuries by the narrative of @entity70 and his fellow @entity71			1
in a departure from past digs involving native sites , archaeologists sought the counsel of @entity66 leaders before and during the exploration , honouring their wishes that burial grounds not be disturbed and helping interpret what was discovered			1
legendary figure : a portrait of @entity6 , who converted to @entity84 after she was captured by the @entity19 and married a settler for @entity88 , a @entity89 doctoral candidate who has worked at the site since 2005 , ' recovering things out of the ground ' was secondary to working with her fellow @entity54			1
' unfortunately , native people in the past have had no involvement at all in the way that their history has been investigated , uncovered and presented to the public , ' said ms @entity88 , who is 28			2
' most people would think , " they would n't be involved in uncovering your own history ? " but the reality is that has not been the common practice			2
' @entity104 , a @entity54 and @entity52 's brother , worked at the site for years			1
he recalled @entity66 visiting the sweeping expanse overlooking the @entity3 and being overcome			1
' it gets emotional , ' he said			2
' and when you 're digging you can really feel it			2
' @entity110 , a @entity89 anthropologist , said the involvement of native people ' enhanced the project immensely			2
' only a fraction of @entity115 has been explored , perhaps just 2 per cent			2
after decades of research , archaeologists used the writings of @entity70 and others , ancient maps and their own detective work to conclude with near - certainty that this was @entity8 's seat of power			2
it was just 15 miles from @entity126 , the first permanent @entity19 settlement established in the @entity128			0
@entity8 's powerful chiefdom covered 30 political divisions and a population of 15,000 to 20,000 people , while nearby @entity126 settlers struggled to survive in their new environment			0
excavations have yielded the outline of the largest longhouse ever found in @entity5 and a system of ditches that may have separated sacred and secular areas			1
' emotional ' : @entity54 @entity66 @entity104 , left , with @entity141 , retired state archaeologist , centre , and @entity110 , college of @entity146 professor , right , who have all worked on the excavation of the site @entity141 , a retired state archaeologist whose hunt for @entity115 dates to the @entity150 , said @entity8 's empire was ' one of the most complex political entities in all of eastern @entity154			1
' the leader ' had the power of life and death ' and expanded his empire through warfare or the threat of warfare			1
' he 's one of the most interesting political and military figures that i 've ever read about , ' mr @entity141 said			0
' and we 're just getting hints in the historical records of all he accomplished in his lifetime			0
' spiritual : mr @entity52 , whose brother is chief of the @entity54 tribe , helped with the excavations			0
in a departure from past digs at native sites , archaeologists sought the counsel of @entity66 leaders retelling an untold story : professor @entity110 gestures as he walks the site , which was discovered by chance by the landowner when she found arrowheads and fragments of pipes while out walking her dog ' one of the most complex political entities in all of eastern @entity154 ' : mr @entity141 , centre , said @entity8 is one of the most interesting political and military figures that he has ever read about the discovery of @entity115 can be credited to a pure - bred dog belonging to the land 's owners , @entity196 and @entity197			1
@entity198 used to walk around their land with her @entity201 , an @entity203 competitor named @entity204			0
she would remove debris that could cut her dog 's paws , and found arrowheads , spear tips , pipe stems and pottery shards			1
' i just seemed to have an eye for it , ' she said			0
' that 's how it all began , so our dog would n't cut his feet			1
it 's like we were meant to be there and i was meant to find these things			0
' the clincher was the discovery of copper , which was valued by the @entity21 as gold is today			0
' i am absolutely convinced this is @entity229 , ' mr @entity141 said			0
' it makes no sense for it to be anywhere else			0
' that conclusion is supported by the @entity234 , @entity89 , the @entity235 and the @entity236			0
@entity21 hope work at the site will continue to build on what is known about @entity8 and the centuries before him , dispelling myths about what the first @entity71 settlers found when they arrived			1
' i want people to understand there was a real civilisation , a complex cultural community that existed prior to @entity71 colonisation , ' ms @entity88 said			1
' @entity71 did n't bring civilisation			0
they brought a lot of other things , some good , some bad			0
' @entity254 , executive director of the state 's historic resources agency , said the site ' certainly tells an aspect of a story that often goes untold			1
in tangible ways , it is their @entity126			0
' digging up the hidden past : this june 26 , 2003 photo provided by the @entity264 shows students hard at work excavating the site , where among other things they discovered the outline of the largest longhouse ever found in @entity5 and a system of ditches that may have separated sacred and secular areas the preservation will be commemorated on friday at a ceremony with @entity5 governor @entity276 and @entity66 leaders			1
an easement will ensure the site remains undeveloped and open to future exploration			1
it is part of more than 250 acres owned by the @entity282 , who have lived there for nearly 17 years			0
when ms @entity254 approached them with the idea of preserving the site , ' we decided it really is the best thing , ' @entity197 said			1
' if we do nothing else for @entity21 , we 've done the very best because we have preserved it for all time with an entity that has the power to enforce its easement : the state of @entity5 , ' he said			0
mrs @entity198 said , ' it 's their heritage , their history			0
we felt a huge responsibility to protect it			0
' she hopes her collection of artifacts can be displayed someday in a museum on the site			1
centuries after @entity8 ruled , she added , this place still resonates with what it once was			0
' it 's definitely a sacred place , ' she said			0
' it 's serene , it 's spiritual , it 's beautiful			0
i feel very good about what we 've done			0

excavation was the first to be carried out with the counsel of @entity66 leaders
site was found by chance by landowner while out walking her dog
it was the centre of a sprawling , complex empire before @entity329 arrived
