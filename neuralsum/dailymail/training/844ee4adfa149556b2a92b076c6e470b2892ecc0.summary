but town - dwelling nature lovers can now bring a touch of the countryside to their homes thanks to an new rooftop box bird box			0
designer @entity10 , 28 , made the box from terracotta clay so that it blends into a regular tile when it goes on the tiles of a house			1
ornithologist 's dream : @entity10 's tile bird house is made from terracotta so that it blends in with city dweller 's roofs it may not look like the most comfortable nesting spot for a bird , but hidden underneath the tile is a cosy basket that is strong enough to stop the bird getting through into the roof			1
mr @entity29 inspired to create his innovative bird box to encourage more birds into urban areas after reading that sparrow numbers were steadily decreasing			2
although originally designed for sparrows , other birds have been known to use the boxes since bird lovers started snapping up the special tiles			1
the bird box is attached to the tile using strong glue which is tough enough to resist extreme temperatures and strong winds			2
mr @entity10 , from @entity44 , in @entity45 , said : ' i spent some time trying to figure out a solution to this problem			1
' after a little bit of research i discovered the sparrow often finds it difficult to find a nesting spot			0
' this is because its old favourite spot tucked in under roof tiles does not exist much anymore because of new building regulations			1
' cosy : the terracotta exterior of the birdhouse might not look like a comfortable home for a bird , but underneath its hard exterior is a nest the 8in tall bird box roof tiles have proved popular in @entity45 and are available across the world by ordering online			1
the bird box only comes with one type of roof tile at the moment , but mr @entity10 is busy working on different designs			1
the boxes should only be put up on the north or east of the house to ensure they are not in direct sunlight			2
but mr @entity10 says that heat from the sun should n't have any damaging effect on the birds			1
he said : ' since i invented this i have heard a few people say you will end up with boiled eggs because of the sun. ' but this is the place the sparrows used to use as nesting spot and that 's why it 's such a good spot			0
' you have to be careful with the placement of the box			0
for example it has to be on the north or east side of the house so it will be out of the sun and not heat up too much			0
' having said that birds know exactly where to find a good spot to nest and if they think it it will be too warm , they will not go in			2
it is as simple as that			0
' the tiles cost just under Â£ 100 .			0
