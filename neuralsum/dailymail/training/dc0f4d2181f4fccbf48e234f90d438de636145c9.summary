by @entity0 the @entity1 is a joyous celebration of all things fast and furious			0
yet for one parent yesterday , things were far from fun when their six month - old baby became trapped in their car			1
step forward the ' fourth emergency service , ' the @entity10 , who proved to live up to their tagline			1
fourth emergency service : the @entity10 , pictured either side of founder of the @entity17 , left , and @entity18 , right , rescued a baby trapped in a car the company are official partners of this year 's @entity17 , and as such offered members of the public free membership for the opening day on wednesday			1
and almost immediately they were forced into action to prevent what could have turned into a precarious situation			0
at the @entity30 , the baby became trapped inside a 2012 @entity31 , with the keys in the vehicle			1
[ related ] the fire brigade were called by the hotel staff , but people panicked as the car was in direct sunlight and temperatures were rising			1
but @entity10 man @entity40 , 38 , who has been on patrol since he was 19 , was on hand to rescue the situation , arriving within minutes and forcing entry into the vehicle and handing over the baby to a very emotional parent			1
the @entity17 is the largest motoring garden party in the world , and was founded in 1993 by @entity50			0
held in the immaculate grounds of @entity54 , this annual @entity52 event is a true celebration of motor sport			0
this year 's theme is ‘ addicted to @entity63 – the @entity64 ’ , celebrating the legendary drivers and riders , teams and manufacturers , who have swept all before them in their sport			0
visitors can expect to see cars and motorbikes from over 100 years of worldwide motor racing history climb the hill			0
the fire brigade arrived shortly after , blue lights flashing , but the situation had been resolved , and their job became to merely sign off what could have become a desperate situation			0
the hotel staff were extremely impressed by the @entity10 's rescue mission			1
and it will be a feather in the cap for the organisation , with the fourth emergency service beating the third			0
the man with the plan @entity40 said : ' there was a big crowd around the car and it was scorching			1
i shouted at onlookers to cover the car from the heat and they took a material banner from the hotel and put it over the car			2
' i spotted the keys in a big bunch on the front seat			2
i managed to force in a rod but it was a tricky and delicate move as i had to turn the keys over and then just managed to press the remote with my rods			1
' to load cheers the door unlocked and i recovered the baby girl			2
i had heard sirens in the background but just got on with my job and got the baby out in minutes			2
' the crowd just continued to cheer me as the fire engine arrived			2
they was lots of banter about the fourth emergency service but to me it is just part of my brilliant job			0
' @entity119 , @entity10 president , added : ' yesterday was a momentous day for the @entity10			1
we became a @entity121 ( plc ) for the first time in our 109 history and flagged off that event at the start of the @entity17 ( see picture )			0
' but perhaps more importantly our hero patrols continued doing what they are best at in the world – rescuing vulnerable people			0
' it was a good job we offered to rescue anyone in need at @entity1 as panic was setting in near the @entity1 hotel when a six - month old baby was locked in her car			1
a crowd had gathered around the frantic parents as the temperatures rose			1
' @entity143 patrol got there with minutes of being called and before the fire service and managed to use his technical skills whilst watched by a crowd			2
we are pleased to announce that the baby , parents and patrol are doing just fine			0
