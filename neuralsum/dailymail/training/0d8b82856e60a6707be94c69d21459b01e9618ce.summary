by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 10:43 est , 18 march 2013 diversity : a historic decline in the number of @entity5 whites and the fast growth of @entity7 are blurring traditional black - white color lines a historic decline in the number of @entity5 whites and the fast growth of @entity7 are blurring traditional black - white color lines , testing the limits of civil rights laws and reshaping political alliances as ' whiteness ' begins to lose its numerical dominance			1
long in coming , the demographic shift was most vividly illustrated in last november 's re-election of president @entity17 , the first black president , despite a historically low percentage of white supporters			2
it 's now a potent backdrop to the immigration issue being debated in @entity23 that could offer a path to citizenship for 11 million mostly @entity27 illegal immigrants			0
also , the @entity28 is deciding cases this term on affirmative action and voting rights that could redefine race and equality in the @entity5 the latest census data and polling from @entity0 highlight the historic change in a nation in which non-hispanic whites will lose their majority in the next generation , somewhere around the year 2043			1
despite being a nation of immigrants , @entity43 's tip to a white minority has never occurred in its 237 - year history and will be a first among the world 's major post-industrial societies			1
@entity50 , a developing nation , has crossed the threshold to ' majority - minority ' status ; a few cities in @entity55 and @entity56 are near , if not past that point			1
the international experience and recent @entity5 events point to an uncertain future for @entity5 race relations			1
in @entity50 , where multiracialism is celebrated , social mobility remains among the world 's lowest for blacks while wealth is concentrated among whites at the top			2
in @entity55 , race is not recorded on government census forms and people share a unified @entity73 identity , yet high levels of racial discrimination persist			0
melting pot : despite being a nation of immigrants , @entity43 's tip to a white minority has never occurred in its 237 - year history and will be a first among the world 's major post-industrial societies ' the @entity5 experience has always been a story of color			1
in the 20th century it was a story of the black - white line			2
in the 21st century we are moving into a new off - white moment , ' says @entity89 , a global expert on immigration and dean of @entity93 's @entity92			2
' numerically , the @entity5 is being transformed			1
the question now is whether our institutions are being transformed , ' he said			0
the shift is being driven by the modern wave of @entity5 newcomers from @entity43 and @entity100			1
their annual inflow of 650,000 people since 1965 , at a rate that 's grown in recent years , surpasses the pace of the last great immigration wave a century ago			2
that influx , from 1820 to 1920 , brought in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 from @entity112 and made the gateway of @entity114 , @entity115 , an immigrant landmark , symbolizing freedom , liberty and the @entity5 dream			1
an equal factor is today 's aging white population , mostly baby boomers , whose coming wave of retirements will create a need for first - and second - generation immigrants to help take their place in the workforce			1
currently 63 per cent of the @entity5 population , the white share is expected to drop below 50 per cent by 2043 , when racial and ethnic minorities will collectively become a @entity5 majority			1
hispanics will drive most of the minority growth , due mostly to high birth rates , jumping in share from 17 per cent to 26 per cent			2
the pace of assimilation for today 's latinos and @entity142 is often compared with that of the @entity144 , @entity108 , @entity110 and @entity111 who arrived around the turn of the 20th century and eventually merged into an @entity5 white mainstream			1
by the 1930s , an immigrant - weary @entity43 had imposed strict quotas and closed its borders			1
those newly arrived were pushed to conform and blend in with a white mainstream , benefiting from @entity157 economic programs that generally excluded blacks			0
the immigration quotas also cut off the supply of new workers to ethnic enclaves and reduced social and economic contacts between immigrants and their countries of origin			0
' @entity167 comes to @entity168 , ' read a 1924 opinion headline in the @entity170			0
the author , a @entity5 senator , pledged that strict new immigration quotas would ' preserve racial type as it exists here today			1
' today , data show that @entity7 are embracing @entity5 life but also maintaining strong ties to their heritage , aided by a new stream of foreign - born immigrants who arrive each year			1
hispanics , officially an ethnic group , strive to learn @entity181 and 1 in 4 intermarry , taking a white spouse			0
nowadays , immigrants face less pressure to conform than did their counterparts from a century ago			0
latinos are protected as a minority , benefiting from the 1950s civil rights movement pioneered by blacks			0
nearly 40 per cent of @entity7 now resist a white identity on census forms , checking a box indicating ' some other race ' to establish a hispanic race identity			2
data : the white share of the @entity5 population has been steadily declining since 1980 , and is currently at 63 per cent while growing diversity is often a step toward a post-racial @entity5 , sociologists caution that the politics of racial diversity could just as easily become more magnified			1
a first - of - its - kind @entity0 poll conducted in 2011 found that a slight majority of whites expressed racial bias against @entity27 and that their attitudes were similar to or even greater than the bias they held toward blacks			1
hispanics also remained somewhat residentially segregated from whites in lower - income neighborhoods , hurt in part by the disappearance of good - paying , midskill manufacturing jobs that helped white ethnics rise into the middle class during most of the 20th century			1
it long has been assumed by sociologists that @entity7 eventually would be redefined as ' white ' as they joined the mainstream , but the @entity222 now wants to classify @entity7 as their own distinct group in the next census , in 2020			1
the proposal is based on census research that finds many latinos do not identify with the current race categories			0
one possible revision , urged by @entity230 , a former bureau director , would drop the word ' race ' from the census form altogether , simply offering a set of check boxes for categories such as black , white and @entity27 that is preceded by the question , ' are you ... ? ' ' whether we 're tabulating by income or poverty , @entity27 is treated as a de facto race , ' said @entity243 , chief of the @entity222 's ethnicity and ancestry branch , in an interview			1
as it stands now , he says , many latinos are checking ' some other race			0
' the @entity0 survey was conducted with researchers from @entity252 , the @entity253 and @entity254 at the @entity255			0
@entity257 economist @entity256 projects that by 2030 , the children of today 's immigrants will earn on average 10 per cent to 15 per cent less than nonimmigrant @entity5 , based on past trends , and that @entity7 will particularly struggle because of high rates of poverty , lack of citizenship and lower rates of education			1
in 1940 , the children of early 20th - century white ethnics fared much better on average , earning 21.4 per cent more than nonimmigrants			2
about 35 per cent of @entity27 babies are currently born into poverty , compared with 41 per cent of blacks and 20 per cent for whites			2
' how @entity43 responds now to the new challenges of racial and ethnic diversity will determine whether it becomes a more open and inclusive society in the future - one that provides equal opportunities and justice for all , ' said @entity279 , a @entity280 sociologist and past president of the @entity282			1
the demographic shift has spurred debate as to whether some civil - rights era programs , such as affirmative action in college admissions , should begin to focus on income level rather than race or ethnicity			2
the @entity28 will rule on the issue by late june			0
following a racially lopsided re-election , @entity17 has spoken broadly about promoting social and economic opportunity			0
in his @entity295 speech , he said that rebuilding the middle class is ' our generation 's task			0
' @entity301 @entity300 , @entity302 , a rising star of a mostly white @entity304 party now eager to attract @entity27 voters , is courting supporters in both @entity181 and @entity307 in part by pledging programs that would boost ' social mobility			0
' rising star : @entity301 @entity300 , a key player in the mostly white @entity304 party , is now eager to attract @entity27 voters , courting supporters in both @entity181 and @entity307 left unclear is how much of a role government can or should play in lifting the disadvantaged , in an era of strapped federal budgets and rising debt			0
the @entity27 immigrants include @entity318 , 60 , of @entity319 , who says enjoying a middle - class life is what 's most important to her			2
things turned bad for the @entity324 native in the recent recession after her work hours as a food server were cut at the @entity328 off the @entity329			0
as a result , she could n't make the mortgage payments on a spacious house she purchased and was forced to move into an apartment with her grandchildren			0
while she 's getting almost full - time hours now , money is often on her mind			0
her finances mean retirement is hardly an option , even though she 's got diabetes and is getting older			0
many politicians are ' only thinking of the rich , and not the poor , and that 's not right , ' @entity318 said in @entity307			0
' we need opportunities for everyone			0
