it sounds like something only a @entity3 villain would propose , but the @entity4 planned a mile - wide ‘ space gun ’ powered by the sun. the giant mirror could be used to focus the sun on a target – like the magnifying glasses used by children to create fire			1
a long - forgotten article from @entity13 in 1945 revealed how ‘ @entity15 technical experts came up with the astonishing fact that @entity18 scientists had seriously planned to build a “ sun gun ” ’			2
the mile wide mirror would be able to focus the power of the sun onto a target on @entity23 the giant orbital mirror would ‘ focus the sun ’s rays to a scorching point on the @entity23 ’s surface ’			1
the @entity18 army , readers were told , ‘ hoped to use such a mirror to burn an enemy city or to boil part of an ocean ’			1
the idea came to renowned rocket scientist @entity36 in 1923			0
with an estimated cost of three million marks and taking 15 years to construct , the original purpose of the space mirror was to provide the people of @entity23 with sunshine on demand , anywhere on the globe			1
but @entity36 later described it as the ‘ ultimate weapon ’			0
‘ my space mirror , ’ he wrote , ‘ is like the hand mirrors that schoolboys use to flash circles of sunlight on the ceiling of their classroom			1
a sudden beam flashed on the teacher ’s face may bring unpleasant reactions			0
’ @entity36 , the man behind the ' sun gun ' @entity36 was an @entity60 - born @entity18 physicist and engineer			2
he is considered one of the founding fathers of rocketry and astronautics , and constructed his first model rocket as a school student of 14			0
in 1928 and 1929 @entity36 worked in @entity68 as scientific consultant on the first film ever to have scenes set in space , @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , directed at @entity74 by @entity75 , although he lost the sight in his left eye in an experiment for this film			2
in autumn 1929 , @entity36 launched his first liquid fuel rocket , named @entity83 , helped by his students at the @entity85 , one of whom was @entity86 , who would later head the wartime project to develop the rocket officially called the @entity89 , but far better known today as the @entity89 - which incorporated many of his inventions and ideas			0
@entity36 eventually came to work for his former student , @entity86 , who was developing space rockets for @entity95 , and retired in 1962 at the age of 68 in 1945 , when the victorious allies began sifting through captured war plans , it emerged that the @entity4 had updated @entity36 ’s proposals and begun looking into the possibility of the @entity102 building a mirror weapon in orbit 22,236 miles above the @entity23			2
details of the sun gun emerged again after they were discussed by @entity108 military experts and appeared on internet forums			2
the secret plans by @entity112 's @entity102 party were only found at the end of the war life magazine believed it would be put into orbit in pre-assembled sections			0
it would also contain a manned space station , with 30ft holes in which supply rockets could dock , hydroponic gardens to provide oxygen and solar - powered generators for electric power			1
once in orbit , the ‘ master rocket ’ for the project would unreel six cables			0
spinning the rocket on its axis would extend the cables radially , allowing construction to begin			0
the @entity18 are not the only nation to look into harnessing the power of the sun. in 1999 , the @entity134 unveiled a plan to use a mirror to reflect sunlight to @entity23 during winter			1
the giant mirror would be assembled in space , and also contain a manned space station the cables used to secure the giant mirror - which would extend from a central rocket 19 sep 1938 , @entity146 , @entity18 : the latest plans for a ' sun gun ' were only discovered when @entity150 troops rooted through @entity102 plans after the end of the war a cutaway of the @entity156 rocket compiled by @entity108 intelligence forces			1
@entity36 was believed to be one of the designers of the rocket .			0

giant space mirror would have concentrated the sun 's rays on @entity23
@entity18 army would use it to ' burn enemy cities ' or ' boil part of an ocean '
would also contain a manned space station complete with gardens
