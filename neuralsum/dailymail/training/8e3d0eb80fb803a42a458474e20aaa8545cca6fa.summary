@entity1 's @entity0 who told comrades they must ' consider the incredible offer ' made by state - owned @entity4 for the @entity6 listed property @entity8 's union paymasters have held talks to sell a historic mansion to communist @entity11 for an ‘ incredible ’ £ 21 million – more than three times the asking price			1
left - wing @entity1 , which gives £ 3.5 million a year to @entity14 ’s party , owns @entity15 in @entity16			1
set in eight acres of grounds and once visited by @entity19 , the grand country house lies on the site of a building where sir @entity23 ’s family lived			0
an earlier building on the site was owned by the @entity26 and @entity27 was kept under house arrest in its gatehouse after falling out with @entity30 @entity32 ’s biggest trade union uses the mansion ’s ornate rooms for conferences and training and @entity8 leader @entity14 has visited it on a party away - day			1
but although @entity1 thinks the @entity6 listed property is worth only £ 6.5 million , and is running it at a loss , the state - controlled @entity4 has offered three times over the odds , raising questions as to the deal between them			1
secret papers seen by @entity48 reveal staff of the world ’s fifth - biggest financial institution have visited @entity15 a dozen times and made a series of increasingly generous offers to buy it			1
the move would improve @entity1 ’s accounts and also give the @entity11 an impressive base as they expand their investments in the @entity32			0
‘ @entity69 ’ @entity0 , the hardliner who runs the union behind some of the country ’s most disruptive strikes , told comrades at last month ’s policy conference in @entity66 that they must consider the ‘ incredible ’ offer to ease their financial pressures			1
but delegates warned it would be ‘ ludicrous ’ to sell @entity1 ’s ‘ jewel in the crown ’ , and have raised questions about their leaders ’ links with communist @entity11			0
the final decision had been due to be taken in a vote by the union ’s ruling @entity80 next month but last night the @entity4 claimed it had pulled out of the deal			1
@entity83 , @entity1 ’s executive director of finance , pensions and property , wrote in a recent letter to ‘ address the queries , issues and concerns ’ raised about the proposed sale that ‘ the @entity4 ’s extraordinary offer ’ is far higher than any others received			2
he said @entity1 ’s ‘ financial situation remains tight ’ and added : ‘ if the union sold @entity15 to @entity4 for £ 21 million it would have more financial flexibility to meet the challenges of the coming years without having to increase member subscriptions beyond that otherwise deemed reasonable or to cut front - line services to members			1
@entity102 in @entity16 , which is owned by left - wing unite			2
set in eight acres of grounds and once visited by @entity19 , the grand country house lies on the site of a building where sir @entity23 's family lived ‘ @entity1 ’s communications department has analysed the situation and can not see any negative connotations for @entity1 by selling @entity15 to what is effectively the state of @entity11 ( although doubtless we would be attacked by the right - wing press because they attack us for everything we do )			2
’ critics said the sale ’s boost to union coffers would increase @entity1 ’s control over @entity8 and mr @entity14 , who has unsuccessfully tried to limit the power of the union barons who helped him become party leader			2
it comes after @entity48 revealed that @entity1 chief of staff @entity128 , representing the @entity130 of @entity32 , spoke at a rally in support of @entity134 separatists fighting in @entity135			0
an earlier building on the site of @entity15 was owned by the @entity26 and @entity27 , pictured , was kept under house arrest in its gatehouse after falling out with @entity30 @entity141 , conservative mp for @entity142 and @entity143 , said last night : ‘ what a tidy food chain ! communist @entity11 swelling the coffers of militant @entity0 , which will give him even more power over weak @entity14			1
‘ the unions are already almost single - handedly funding @entity8 and practically writing their policies			0
it will only get worse now			0
’ a union insider said : ‘ why are the @entity11 offering so much money , that ’s the big question that ’s being asked			0
the union is n’t short of cash but all of a sudden there appears to be a big rush to sell this place			0
’ @entity15 ’s latest valuation is £ 6.5 million but the @entity4 has made six offers this year , topping £ 21 million , as well as promising to let @entity1 use the facilities until 2016			1
@entity4 is a commercial bank with a branch in the @entity169 , but is wholly owned and controlled by the @entity11 state			0
@entity11 banks and firms have invested billions in @entity32 industry , taking stakes in nuclear power stations and airports as well as companies such as drinks giant @entity178			0
a @entity1 spokesman claimed last night : ‘ there is no offer from the @entity4 or anyone else			2
’ a spokesman for @entity4 ’s property adviser @entity185 said : ‘ the bank will not be buying @entity1 ’s property under any circumstances			0
