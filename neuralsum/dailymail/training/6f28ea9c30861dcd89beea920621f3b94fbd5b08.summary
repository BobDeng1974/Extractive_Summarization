@entity15 needs a second goalkeeper after @entity17 moved to @entity4 but @entity5 ’s arrival would put current keeper @entity19 under huge pressure			1
@entity5 would expect to oust him and play in the first team if he were to make the move			1
currently behind @entity9 in the @entity24 pecking order , @entity5 could find himself promoted after the 5 - 1 horror show against @entity26 in @entity27 on friday night			1
@entity8 also have @entity27 keeper @entity40 developing well and are keen to spend their budget in other areas			2
@entity15 tried to sign @entity5 in 2010 when @entity12 bid £ 20m but @entity14 refused to sell him at the time			2
replacement : @entity15 is to bring in a second goalkeeper after losing @entity17 to @entity4 earlier this summer @entity5 was a popular figure on @entity48 before he was sent out on loan to serie a side @entity8 the @entity11 no 2 , who is now 31 , would be available for much less than that now , with just two years left on his contract and with @entity54 having established himself as the new no 1 at @entity14			1
