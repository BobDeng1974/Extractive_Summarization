the data shown in the map covers the period of july and august this year and uses information collected by website analytics firm @entity50			2
each colour represents that most visited website in that country and each three individual blocks represent around one million users			0
the countries are unusual sizes as the map effectively exaggerates countries that almost exclusively use one type of search engine			1
@entity0 is shown in red , @entity17 is blue			1
@entity72 is shown in purple and has a stronghold over @entity75 , while @entity23 's favourite site is the search engine @entity22			1
@entity22 is also popular in @entity78 , ahead of the country 's own search engine @entity79			1
the majority of most - visited sites were search engines , but @entity17 was also popular			1
although @entity17 was predominantly popular in the west , it was also the most visited site in @entity88 and @entity89			2
the @entity95 newspaper was the most visited website in the @entity97 , the email service @entity93 is the most visited site in @entity99 , the social network @entity91 was the most visited in @entity100 , and the search engine @entity102 was the most popular site in @entity104			1

we also see an interesting geographical continuity of these two ' empires '			0
@entity0 is shown in red , @entity17 is blue			2
@entity72 is shown in purple and has a stronghold over @entity75 , while @entity23 's favourite site is the search engine @entity22 , shown in green			1
@entity22 is also popular in @entity78 , ahead of the country 's own search engine @entity79 ' the situation is more complex in @entity121 , as local competitors have been able to resist the two large @entity124 empires			1
' at the same time , we see a puzzling fact that @entity22 is also listed as the most visited website in @entity78 - ahead of the popular search engine @entity79			1
' we speculate that the raw data that we are using here are skewed			0
however , we may also be seeing the @entity22 empire in the process of expanding beyond its traditional home territory			0
' areas in sub-saharan @entity135 are n't covered by @entity50 , yet @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity135 are within the sphere of @entity0 â€™s empire			0
whereas @entity141 , @entity142 , and @entity143 prefer @entity17			0
on this map the countries bathed in blue are used to depict the global spread of @entity17 , as of september 2013			0
the map shows a rising popularity in @entity135 , @entity150 , and @entity151 - as also highlighted in the @entity153 map among the 50 countries where @entity17 was listed as the most visited visited website , 36 of them had @entity0 as the second most visited , with the remaining 14 countries listing @entity158 , the @entity0 - owned video site			2
the countries where @entity0 is the most visited website account for half of the entire internet population - over one billion people			0
a large proportion of the population in @entity23 and @entity78 use the internet , giving @entity22 second place overall in terms of visitors			1
the 50 @entity17 countries account for about 280 million users , placing the social network in third			0
' we are likely still in the very beginning of the @entity178 , ' the researchers conclude			0
' but , it may well be that the territories carved out now will have important implications for which companies end up controlling how we communicate and access information for many years to come			0

figures cover worldwide internet users over the period of july to august
@entity0 dominates overall while @entity17 sits in second place
@entity23 's @entity22 is popular in @entity78 , ahead of its own search engine @entity79
