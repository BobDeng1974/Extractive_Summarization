the man suspected of shooting his daughter in the head before turning the gun on himself was ' not supposed to know where she and her mother lived ' , a neighbour said today			1
residents in the quiet village of @entity9 , @entity10 , said the gunman was involved in a custody dispute over the seven - year - old girl , named locally as @entity14 , and that the father was thought not to know their address			1
but one neighbour who heard the gunshots yesterday afternoon said she had seen the gunman 's silver @entity21 4 driving around the village - home to @entity14 and her mother , @entity23 since last april - for the past week			1
the little girl , a pupil at @entity25 , was today ' gravely , gravely ill ' in @entity26 , @entity27 , her mother at her bedside , as police confirmed they believed the shooting to have been a domestic incident			1
a blanket covering the man 's body can be seen behind a car ( circled ) villagers spoke of their shock at the horror in what is a leafy , quiet village near the border with @entity48 this morning a police spokesman said the girl 's condition was life - threatening and added ' we probably need to prepare ourselves for bad news '			1
@entity55 told how they heard the girl ’s mother – who is separated from the father – scream ' he ’s got a gun ' before two shots rang out			1
her father , who locals said fired at his daughter from inside his car , was pronounced dead at the scene in the village , with a single gunshot wound to the head			1
one said : ‘ apparently he was not supposed to know where @entity23 and her daughter moved to			1
