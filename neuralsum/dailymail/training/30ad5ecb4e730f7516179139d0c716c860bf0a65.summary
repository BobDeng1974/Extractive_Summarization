by @entity0 published : 01:18 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 8 november 2013 the @entity3 , @entity2 police department was the scene of a mind - blowing vandalism			2
a @entity3 police officer 's car was mysteriously damaged on wednesday			2
strangely enough , no one is to blame			0
surveillance footage of a ' ghostlike ' entity twirling around the parking lot and brushing up against the cop car is the unlikely culprit			1
the footage shows the ' ghostly ' fog creeping towards the car , violently twirling around the vehicle , and then ripping the vehicle 's mirror and jostling it mid air			2
finally the mirror drops harshly to the ground beneath the car door			1

at first , cops thought that a human was responsible for the damage but the surveillance video footage proved otherwise			0
' some of the officers said they think the parking lot 's haunted , ' said lt. @entity69 to @entity77			1
lt. @entity69 of the @entity70 said that some officers think that the parking lot is haunted @entity77 @entity2 meteorologist @entity80 concluded that the mysterious fog was actually a dust devil @entity83 , an @entity77 meteorologist , believes there is a more scientific explanation for the event			1
after reviewing the video , @entity83 concluded that the fog was not a ghost , but a dust devil			1
a dust devil is a mini-tornado of sorts			0
it 's a swirl of wind that picks up the debris surrounding it			0
they have been known to form on asphalt surfaces			0
' the only way you can see the dust devil is that it picks up dust and debris into it , ' @entity83 said			0
' to be able to rip a mirror off a car , throw it around and then put it right back below where it was ripped off is interesting ... to say the least , ' @entity69 told @entity77			1
a public information officer for the @entity70 told the @entity110 that while the event was creepy he had n't heard of any other parking lot hauntings			2
' i have n't heard to much of that stuff going on there but do n't scare me because i parked my car there			0
maybe you can research what building was previously on this land to investigate evidence of a haunting , ' he joked .			0

' some of the officers said they think the parking lot 's haunted , ' said @entity3 lt. @entity69
@entity77 meteorologist @entity83 concluded that the fog is not a ghost , rather it is a mini-tornado
