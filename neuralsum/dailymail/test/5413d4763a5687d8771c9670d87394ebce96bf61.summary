and he should have plenty to offer @entity48 's side on the evidence of his highlights reel for his club and the @entity10 youth teams			2
the @entity54 compilations certainly offer enough to get @entity4 fans excited - there are lightning - fast runs through opposition defences , pinged long balls to the forward line and a promising knack of getting into goalscoring positions			2
most of the best bits come from the 2013 @entity65 , the tournament that first alerted the @entity3 elite to @entity15 's talents			1
although @entity28 only reached the quarter - finals of the competition , @entity15 scored five goals and demonstrated his full potential			0
he found the net twice in a 6 - 1 rout of @entity74 and scored two more as the hosts uae were beaten by the same scoreline			0
@entity15 is brought down by @entity78 of @entity74 to win a penalty during the @entity65 in 2013 the young midfielder made his name while starring for @entity28 at the tournament two years ago in @entity83 @entity15 shows his strength by shrugging off the challenge of @entity87 's @entity86 in the last eight , he scored an 85th - minute equaliser in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity90 , before converting in the marathon penalty shootout , which @entity28 ultimately lost 10 - 11			1

but those performances out in the @entity103 put the rocket boosters on his career , with promotion into the first - team squad at his club and advancement to the @entity28 under 20 team , for whom he has played five times			0
@entity4 will soon boast another @entity10 in their ranks to add to the likes of @entity42 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) @entity15 will join @entity43 ( right , in action against @entity115 last sunday ) as the fifth @entity10 in the squad @entity15 will not be ready to throw into the @entity4 first - team right away			1
