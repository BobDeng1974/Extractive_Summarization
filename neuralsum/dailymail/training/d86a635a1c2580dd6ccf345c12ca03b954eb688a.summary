@entity0 scored one of the goals of the season as @entity4 answered their critics with a 4 - 1 win at @entity7 , but boss @entity8 is now focusing on improving their domestic form			1
the 23 - year - old 's sensational 30 - yard half - volley - which was so good it was applauded by the home fans and started debates about great goals on social media - made it 3 - 0 after half an hour as the @entity10 put in a commanding display in @entity12 , showing no hangover from the disappointment of saturday 's 3 - 2 defeat at @entity16			1
a lot of the reaction on @entity28 focused on @entity4 forward @entity29 , who just looked flabbergasted after @entity0 's strike went in			1
@entity0 celebrates after scoring his second goal of the night against @entity7 @entity33 looked on astonished after @entity0 smashed home a 30 - yarder against the @entity36 side @entity4 goalkeeper @entity37 holds his head in his hands in disbelief after watching the strike he was very modest in his reaction to his wonder strike after the match , saying : ' the ball came to the edge of the box and i thought , ' why not have a go ? ' so i had a go and it went in			1
' it was the @entity53 midfielder 's second goal of the match , with @entity55 also scoring twice for the visitors , while @entity57 clipped home a late 20 - yard free - kick as a small consolation for @entity7			1
the win was a big one for @entity8 after he was jeered and subjected to some aggressive personal abuse as the players boarded the train back to @entity65 at @entity16 after losing at the weekend			0
the 65 - year - old now has his eyes firmly fixed on remedying their stuttering @entity69 form while they wait to find out who they will face in the last 16 of the @entity73 next year			1
video watch @entity29 's reaction to @entity0 's super strike @entity77 's draw against @entity78 , however , means @entity4 finished second in @entity79 and so could face the likes of @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 or defending champions @entity84 when the pairings are made on monday			1
by then , though , @entity8 believes @entity4 could themselves be a very different prospect , with several key players set to return from injury in the coming weeks			2
' let 's wait for the draw , prepare well			0
we can focus now on the @entity69 , ' said @entity8			0
' it was my 180th game in @entity73 on tuesday night , we won away from home and now 15 consecutive years in the last 16			2
that , i believe , is an achievement			0
' so let 's focus on the @entity69 until the end of february and the @entity100 as well , after then we will see where we stand			0
' the @entity102 coach was pleased with the ' strong response ' shown by his team			0
' we looked dangerous every time we won the ball back , we had good penetration , we scored good goals and until half - time i feel we were very strong , ' he said			2
' ( in the ) second half we suffered a bit more for two reasons - some players had not enough competitive games and especially i had to take two players off			2
' we were a bit more lightweight in the second half in midfield			0
' we were closer to conceding one or two more in the second half and we defended very well			0
' we still had our opportunities but some decisions around the box went against us in the second half , but we tried and overall , it was a strong performance			0
' both @entity0 and @entity122 were taken off at the break with minor muscle problems , but are expected to be available for saturday 's late afternoon kick - off against @entity126 at the @entity127 .			1

@entity4 beat @entity7 4 - 1 in the @entity73
@entity0 scored a stunning effort to make it 3 - 0
@entity29 could *n't* believe what he *'d* seen in the immediate *aftermath*
