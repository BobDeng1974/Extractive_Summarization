by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 27 august 2013 a mother who lost her young son in a tragic accident is now running a single - handed campaign to get statutory bereavement leave extended for parents who lose a child from the current three days to at least four weeks			1
@entity9 's 23 - month - old son @entity8 drowned in their garden pond in august 2010 when @entity9 took her eyes off him for just a short moment			1
on top of the unimaginable grief , @entity9 discovered that as a bereaved parent her then - partner could take just three days paid leave off work - one of which had to be for the funeral			1
@entity9 with @entity8 at the seaside : @entity8 drowned in a tragic accident and @entity9 's partner , @entity8 's father , was given just three days off work any additional time was to be taken as either sick leave or holiday			1
this compounded the pain of the grieving process and left both parents without the support of the other at a time when both were incredibly fragile			0
' as a mum my world died the day @entity8 died , ' @entity9 said			1
' it was every mother 's worst nightmare : i took my eyes off @entity8 for those split moments and he wandered away from my protection			2
' jack with his older sister @entity45 : there is currently no specific law granting time off for bereavement ' i do n't really remember the days straight after @entity8 's death , i remember feeling a pain like no other , i can honestly say my heart physically hurt and that hurt is still there but trying to make a positive heals me slightly			1
' when my family all left as they had to go back to work as their bereavement leave had ended i felt alone , lost and abandoned , how on earth was i going to continue to live without their support and love around me 24/7 ? ' but i did live and i have survived , and i 'm now campaigning for other parents not to have to worry about losing their jobs after a death of a child			2
it is a great healing process as is setting up @entity71			2
' the pressures of bereavement eventually led to @entity9 separating from @entity8 's dad , and she has since left @entity75 , where they lived , and moved with her two older children to @entity77 , in @entity78 , to be closer to her family			1
@entity9 said : ' my world died the day @entity8 died ' although granting only three days off after the death of a child may seem unthinkable , a parent whose child has died is not entitled to any statutory leave under the law			1
there is in fact very little legislation on such issues , leaving companies to grant ' compassionate leave ' at their discretion			0
at present , parents may be entitled to ' time off for dependents '			0
this is a legal right to unpaid leave to cope with family emergencies			0
although there is no upper limit to the amount of time specified , it should be ' reasonable ' and should only be the amount that is ' sufficient ' to deal with the situation			0
@entity107 guidance said : ' there 's no set amount of time allowed to deal with an unexpected event involving a dependant - it will vary depending on what the event is but for most cases one or two days should be sufficient to deal with the problem			2
' @entity9 said : ' when a child dies , particularly if that death is sudden and unexpected , there should be provision for the parents to take paid time off work			2
' while many good employers offer compassionate leave , there is no statutory right to leave and this campaign aims to introduce four weeks of paid " bereavement leave " for parents			0
' in the immediate aftermath of the death parents have to cope with their own loss , the grief of their wider family , including other children , as well as a vast amount of administrative and other arrangements			0
' three days is not enough : @entity9 is hoping that she can persuade parliament to vote to grant all grieving parents at least four weeks off work she continued : ' a sudden or accidental death may require a post mortem or inquest ; there is a funeral to arrange ; and many other organisations to contact from schools to benefit offices			1
' @entity9 is in the process of setting up a charity in @entity8 's memory called @entity71			1
it will provide other families with round - the - clock support and funding for holidays in order to try and create new memories for the family			0
she is also planning a campaign in the summer to highlight the danger of garden ponds			0
@entity9 's aim is to get the @entity164 to change the statutory leave entitlement for an employee who has lost a child from three days to four weeks			1
@entity9 is hoping she can persuade parliament to vote to grant all grieving parents at least four weeks off work			0
an online petition has been started by @entity9 which needs 100,000 signatures to force the government to have a debate on the issue			0
the petition can be found here .			0
