' damage ' : @entity8 , 28 , left , and @entity10 , 29 , both seen outside court in @entity22 , were caught ' waist deep ' in a badger sett they were charged with the badger set attack and jointly charged with breaching the @entity26 along with @entity27 , 54 , the former master of the @entity29 , and two other hunt staff , @entity31 , 58 , and @entity32 , 18			1
but today , at @entity33 in @entity22 , the @entity7 dropped the hunt charges after @entity8 and @entity10 pleaded guilty to interfering with a badger sett			1
outside court an outraged mr @entity27 condemned the @entity7 prosecution as a ' complete outrage ' and a ' disgrace '			1
mr @entity27 , a @entity40 councillor for @entity22 , said : ' it has been a complete outrage and i would hope that every single member of the public think as to whether they give their hard earned money to the society in order to waste it			1
' the @entity7 has spent £ 50,000 pursuing this and they have been given £ 500 in costs			1
it is an absolute disgrace			0
' the two members of our group who pleaded guilty to interfering with a badger sett is an unfortunate event but they were going after their dog and the sentence reflected the judges view			1
' @entity60 : ( @entity61 ) @entity62 , @entity31 , @entity10 and @entity63 are seen leaving the court , some carrying evidence bags district judge @entity67 heard that on march 6 2012 the five men , who were out hunting , were alerted that their dogs had marked a fox in a nearby field			1
@entity62 and @entity10 , who were riding on a quad bike , reached the area first and began to assess the situation			2
they let the inexperienced terrier , @entity14 , loose and it ran off and disappeared			1
the huntsmen located the dog in the sett after they heard barking from below the ground			0
they tried to use a location collar to pull him out but when that failed they began digging at the ground to free him , the court was told			0
@entity89 , prosecuting , said : ' an onlooker saw the men digging in the sett and describes the digging as furious with soiling flying			0
former hunt master : @entity96 branded the court case a ' complete outrage ' , and claimed the @entity7 had spent £ 50,000 pursuing it ' the police and the @entity7 turned up and the men were questioned			1
' there had been considerable interference with the set , digging and filling in the entrances			0
in total there were 15 entrances to the sett , 11 of which had been blocked			0
' @entity7 inspector @entity111 , who turned up at the site , described it as " the worst find he has ever witnessed in his 25 years of being an inspector "			1
' he added that @entity62 had been seen by another onlooker waist deep in the sett digging.the traumatised terrier eventually resurfaced two hours after it had first become stuck , suffering deep cuts and puncture wounds to his neck and face			2
the @entity7 had originally brought charges against all five huntsman of breaking the @entity26 ban , but decided to drop the cases after accepting the guilty pleas from @entity128 , of @entity129 , and @entity10 , of @entity130			1
mr @entity27 , of @entity131 , mr @entity31 , of @entity132 , and mr @entity32 , of @entity133 , all denied any wrong - doing			0
@entity134 , defending @entity62 , told the court : ' it was certainly a badger sett and it was accepted that he had been the one who was up to his waist in it and he took full responsibility for that			2
' but it was out of concern for the terrier			0
' mr @entity62 accepted his responsibility from the beginning			0
seeing it was an active badger set made him even more concerned about @entity14			2
' @entity147 , for mr @entity10 , said her client had accepted that it was ' reckless ' to let @entity14 free			1
' it was clear that @entity14 had escaped and it was reckless to allow the dog out of the cage before fully investigating , ' he said			2
' he accepts that he was digging in an effort to find his dog , he did n't intentionally set out to damage the sett but he acted recklessly to find his lost dog			1
' district judge @entity67 handed the pair a £ 300 fine and ordered them to pay £ 250 costs and a £ 15 victim surcharge			1
he told them : ' in my mind the main aspect of this case was a failure to control @entity14			1
' reliable or not , he should have been kept in his box			0
he got out and disappeared down the sett			0
' why he did it is speculation , but that he should have been allowed to do it was wrong			0
you are both responsible and you both could have prevented it			0
' @entity176 , director of campaigns at the @entity178 , accused the @entity7 of wasting money on a ' politically motivated ' prosecution			2
he said : ' it is absolutely disgraceful that the @entity7 has spent 14 months and £ 50,000 of its members ' money on a prosecution which was completely groundless and clearly politically motivated			1
' it is even worse that the taxpayer has had to pick up the bill for the court and the defendants ' costs			2
' the @entity7 investigation set out to find evidence to justify a prosecution , not to seek out the truth			2
even so it has now had to accept that there was absolutely no basis for the prosecution			0
' the @entity7 inspector who complied the case against the five men said he would have been ' heavily criticised ' if he had walked away from prosecution			2
inspector @entity111 said : ' there was severe damage to that badger sett and with all the money it has cost i would have been heavily criticised if i had walked away and left it			1
' i have had 25 years ' experience as a wildlife officer and i have dealt with numerous badger cases and that is the biggest , deepest , hole that i have seen dug			0
' a spokesman for the @entity7 added : ' the @entity7 received a call that a group of men had been seen on and around a badger sett in @entity220 at the time that the @entity29 was riding in the vicinity			2
' on examining the area , @entity7 inspector @entity111 found that a large hole had been dug directly down into the active badger sett , breaking a tunnel and entrances had been blocked up			2
' a small @entity228 emerged from the sett , muddy , dazed and bleeding badly from his jaw			0
he was fitted with an underground location collar			0
' the dog , which belonged to @entity10 , was taken to a vet who found his injuries were consistent with having been attacked by the claws and teeth of an animal whilst underground			0
' the defendants gave conflicting accounts at the scene including chasing foxes , rabbits and searching for a lost dog			0
' the badger sett where the men were spotted was in @entity220 , near @entity132 , @entity22			0
the @entity7 was today unable to confirm the exact amount spent on the prosecution .			0
