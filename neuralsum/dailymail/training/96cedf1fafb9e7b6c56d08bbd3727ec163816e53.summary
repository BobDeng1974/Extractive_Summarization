by @entity0 last updated at 4:43 pm on 22nd september 2011 a young @entity2 ballet star has become the first foreign dancer to become a ' premier ' with the famed @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity7 , who will also remain a principal with the @entity10 - based @entity9 , received the distinction earlier this year			1
until now , foreign dancers were only invited for guest stints and traditionally it has been stars from @entity6 who move to the @entity2 so harsh was the political climate , even those dancers that fled the @entity18 were said to have faced death warrants ordered by the @entity20			2
stunning moves : @entity7 leaps across the stage during the @entity9 's production of @entity24			1
the 29 - year - old has won a place at the prestigious @entity5 in @entity6 but in an interview , @entity7 , from @entity27 , made it clear he fully grasps the significance of his move			1
' it 's a milestone , ' the 29 - year - old said by telephone during a break in rehearsals for an upcoming tour			2
it 's a huge challenge , but i feel it 's important , not just for me as an artist , but for the dance world - and , in the bigger picture , maybe even for international relations			2
' historically , some of the finest dancers from eastern @entity47 have moved to the @entity2 @entity48 defected to the @entity49 in 1961 and @entity50 in 1974 - both great dancers who fled the @entity18 for freedom and better opportunities			0
@entity54 ballet dancer @entity48 performs a similar move to @entity7 while in rehearsals alongside @entity57 the leader of the @entity59 , @entity58 , attempted to keep @entity48 in the country and a @entity20 death warrant is said to have been ordered for him			1
but @entity7 's reverse move shows how much the world has changed			1
@entity7 , at 29 , is already regarded as one of the most talented male ballet dancers in the world			1
in six years as a principal with @entity9 , he has captivated audiences with his pure , elegant form , weightless jumps , regal bearing and tall , blond good looks			0
he performs in modern as well as classical pieces , but is especially suited to princely roles such as @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 in @entity79 or @entity80			0
first approached by the @entity5 in april , while performing in @entity6 , @entity7 said his decision took time and was extremely difficult			1
@entity83 : from left , @entity48 , who defected from the @entity18 to the @entity49 in 1961 , and @entity50 , also from @entity84 , who defected to @entity85 in 1974			0
poise : @entity48 , who died in 1993 , performs alongside @entity88 at the @entity89 , @entity90 ' it was really hard because the responsibility is really great ; there 's a responsibility to really do this justice , ' he said			0
' i by no means want to compare this to the weight of the defections of @entity50 ( @entity50 ) and @entity48			0
i was n't even around yet			0
i ca n't imagine what it was like for them			0
' but , he added : ' there is a correlation			0
this is about the globalisation of the world , and the globalisation of dance in particular			0
' @entity7 said he will split his time between the two companies , living both in @entity10 and in @entity6			1
in a statement , the @entity5 hailed its newest ' premier ' , or principal			2
' mr @entity7 ... possesses all the best qualities of classical dancer - perfect technique , refined manners and outstanding acting abilities , ' said artistic director @entity123			0
@entity7 's first appearance with the @entity5 is expected to be @entity79 , with the young @entity5 sensation @entity125 as his partner			2
the two won raves when they performed the ballet together at the @entity10 based @entity9 ' we have a special connection , ' @entity7 added .			1

as ' premier ' at the ballet @entity7 , 29 , will perform with world 's best
he *'ll* hold two principal roles , one in @entity10 , the other in @entity6
