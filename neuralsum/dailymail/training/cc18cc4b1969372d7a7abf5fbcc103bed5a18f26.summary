the government 's multi-billion pound home loans scheme is not pushing up property prices , the @entity0 insisted today			2
governor @entity4 said @entity5 does not pose a risk to financial stability and has not driven up house values by increasing demand			1
it is a major boost for chancellor @entity11 , who has faced calls to rein in the mortgage guarantee scheme to only cover homes worth less than £ 260,000			1
more than 35,000 homes have been bought using it so far , amid claims @entity28 is not building enough houses to cope with rising demand			0
in august , the head of the @entity33 global economic think tank called for the price limit to be more than halved to prevent a new property price bubble			1
but now mr @entity4 has written to the chancellor to say the £ 600,000 house price cap , and the fee charged to lenders who use it , ' remain appropriate '			1
he added the help to buy ' does not pose material risks to financial stability '			1
the intervention comes after first annual review by the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) of the scheme			0
@entity0 governor @entity4 has written to the chancellor to say the £ 600,000 house price cap , and the fee charged to lenders who use it , ' remain appropriate ' latest figures from the @entity58 building society showed that house prices actually fell by 0.2 per cent last month , in the latest sign that the property market is cooling			1
however , prices are still dramatically higher than a year ago , ranging from 21 per cent in @entity63 to 4.3 per cent in the north of @entity65			0
mr @entity4 said that while there had been steep house price growth , help to buy ' does not appear to have been a material driver of that growth ' , with weak take - up in @entity63 where rises have been strongest			2
on help to buy , mr @entity4 said the scheme had seen a return of lenders to the high loan - to - value market - representing mortgages of 90 per cent or more of a property 's value			1
but the level of these remained relatively small compared with before the financial crisis , accounting for 9 per cent of mortgages in the year to date compared with 25 per cent in 2007			0
' looking ahead , and based on uptake of the scheme so far , we expect the volume of @entity89 loans to grow , but to become only a modest proportion of lenders ' mortgage books over the life of the scheme			0
' in response mr @entity11 said : ' i was pleased to see the committee 's conclusions that the scheme does not pose material risks to financial stability in the @entity28 and has not been a material driver of recent house price growth			2
' the average house in the @entity28 costs to £ 188,374 , edging down from the all - time peak of £ 189,306 recorded in august , according to latest figures from @entity108 the @entity0 's request for new powers to rein in risky home loans comes after mr @entity11 offered them earlier this year - beefing up its current ability to offer recommendations for controls on the market			2
it said the availability of powers of direction rather than just recommendation could allow it to skirt the need for time - consuming consultation ' where urgent implementation is required '			0
' this can be an important consideration in a market like housing , where quick implementation may be necessary to prevent lenders and borrowers bringing forward transactions in anticipation of policy changes , putting more pressure on the market			0
' the @entity0 is asking for powers of direction over @entity138 ratios as well as debt - to - income ( @entity140 ) ratios .			0

@entity4 said @entity5 does not pose a risk to financial stability
state - backed mortgages offered on properties worth up to £ 600,000
@entity33 called for limit to be lowered to £ 260,000 to prevent boom
but @entity0 insists it is ' appropriate ' and not *fuelling* a property bubble
