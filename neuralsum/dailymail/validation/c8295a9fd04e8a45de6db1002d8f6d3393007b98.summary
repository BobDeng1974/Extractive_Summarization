security experts have warned of the dangers associated with usb drives for some time , but until now , the biggest danger has been viruses and malware			0
now there is a new potential threat that turns the lowly thumb drive into a ‘ laptop killer ’ by using a high voltage to destroy the computer ’s components			1
dubbed ‘ @entity14 ’ , the crude device was created by a @entity16 electronics expert known as @entity17			1
the malicious drive has been dubbed ‘ @entity14 ’ and it uses a high voltage and current to ‘ fry ’ the laptop ’s components			1
the prototype ( pictured ) was created by a @entity16 electronics expert known as @entity17 the user posted photos and specifications about the project on @entity16 blog @entity29 , and this was later syndicated and posted in @entity32 on @entity33			1
the @entity32 post said : ‘ i work in [ a ] company engaged in the development and manufacture of electronics			1
‘ in modern computers , the usb ‘ physics ’ is built in the processor [ and ] the task of the designed usb flash drive is to burn all of this stuff , or at least kill the usb port			1
’ @entity17 posted photos and specifications about his project on @entity16 blog @entity29			1
the user said : ' in modern computers , the usb ‘ physics ’ is built in the processor [ and ] the task of the designed usb flash drive is to burn all of this stuff , or at least kill the usb port ’ ( the custom circuit board is pictured ) the drive uses high voltage and high current to ‘ fry ’ the electronics inside the port			1
and because this port is often connected to the cpu , the whole laptop can be affected			2
a colleague of @entity17 is reported as saying the device is ‘ like an atomic bomb : cool to have , but can not be applied ’ @entity17 ordered the parts , including a custom circuit board , from @entity69 before making a ‘ full - fledged prototype ’			1
and in tests , the user said they had ‘ burnt down ’ everything they could			2
in november a team of @entity77 - based researchers reverse - engineered the files that control how a usb drive 's software works			1
this so - called firmware was then reprogrammed to give complete control of a pc to the hacker			2
firmware is a software program , or set of instructions , programmed onto a hardware device			0
it tells the device how to communicate with other devices , including computers			0
drive manufacturers will often update firmware to improve the performance of their devices			2
these changes are made at a central level before being pushed out to individual devices			0
the flaw was discovered by @entity101 and @entity102 at @entity103 has been dubbed @entity104			2
it affects thumb drives and external hard drives , but also any device that connects to a pc using @entity41			0
this includes keyboards and the mouse , as well as the usb drives used to charge phones and tablets			0
‘ the basic idea of the usb drive is quite simple , ’ explained @entity17			1
‘ when connected to the usb port , an inverting @entity117 / @entity117 converter runs and charges capacitors to @entity121 [ and ] when the voltage is reached , the @entity117 / @entity117 is switched off			2
‘ the loop runs till everything possible is broken down			2
’ put more simply , it uses high voltage and high current to ‘ fry ’ the electronics inside the port			1
and because this port is often connected to the cpu , the whole laptop can be affected			0

the malicious , custom - built drive has been dubbed ‘ @entity14 ’
it uses a high voltage and current to ‘ fry ’ the laptop 's components
prototype was created by an electronics expert known as @entity17
@entity17 designed the drive using parts bought in @entity69
it was described as an ' atomic bomb : cool to have but not to be applied '
