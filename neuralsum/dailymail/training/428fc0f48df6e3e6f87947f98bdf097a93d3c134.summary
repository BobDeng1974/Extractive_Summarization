by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 14:18 est , 12 november 2013 plans to protect a statue of the @entity3 from vandals who keep putting a traffic cone on its head have been withdrawn after thousands protested online			1
the monument to the former prime minister in @entity10 is so frequently targeted by drunk students and other revellers that it more often sports a cone than not			2
the city council this week announced plans to deter the vandalism , which is said to cost £ 10,000 to undo every year , by raising the statue to make it inaccessible			2
prank : the statue of the @entity3 in @entity10 's @entity20 is frequently targeted by vandals who put traffic cones on its head but some residents claim that the cone is itself a venerable city tradition , and a petition against the planned change attracted 10,000 signatures			1
now the council has backed down and cancelled the £ 65,000 refurbishment project in reponse to the public pressure			0
the statue of the @entity3 , who is regarded as one of @entity38 's greatest ever generals after defeating @entity39 at the @entity40 , was erected in 1844 in @entity10 's @entity20			1
in the past few years it has become a magnet for pranksters , who place cones on @entity3 's head as well as on that of his horse			2
the practice has become iconic in some quarters , and in 2011 was named one of the ' top 10 most bizarre monuments on @entity53 ' by the @entity55 guidebook			0
plan : officials proposed raising the statue 's plinth to prevent people from climbing on to it however , the city council claims that it has to remove the cones at least 100 times a year , at a cost of £ 100 each time , and argues that the tradition casts @entity10 in a ' depressing ' light			1
the refurbishment would have raised the statue 's plinth to 6ft , which would ' deter all but the most determined of vandals '			1
the proposal was welcomed by @entity72 , the @entity73 's sculptor in @entity74 , who told @entity75 : ' any move to end the tedious , unfunny , irreverent and strangely righteous addiction @entity10 has had to " coning " the @entity3 statue i greet with warmth			1
outcry : 10,000 people denounced the plans this week ; the statue is pictured last summerwith a cone which was painted gold in honour of @entity10 's successful olympians ' the single most embarrassing thing about the culture of @entity10 has been the cone on the @entity3 's head			1
' but a petition set up by campaigners argued : ' the cone on @entity3 's head is an iconic part of @entity10 's heritage , and means far more to the people of @entity10 and to visitors than @entity3 himself ever has			1
' @entity10 's equestrian statue of the @entity3 was sculpted by @entity105 artist @entity104 and erected in @entity20 in 1844			1
it celebrates the great general 's achievements in defeated @entity39 at the @entity40 in 1815 , after which @entity3 went on to become prime minister			2
the statue stands in front of the city 's @entity111 in one of the most important public squares in @entity10			2
around the early 1980s , pranksters - often including drunk students - began vandalising the statue by placing traffic cones on its heads			0
while the city council has urged residents to avoid damaging the historic monument , some regard the practical joke as evidence of the city 's unique sense of humour			0
after the petition attracted 10,000 signatures , with another 45,000 people showing support on @entity135 , the council announced that the plans were being withdrawn			1
a council spokesman said today : ' the wording of the report was appalling and the leader of the council has instructed officers to withdraw the planning application			0
' campaigner @entity145 organised a protest at the statue today , which was due to become a celebration after the council 's decision			0
' it 's funny and cheers people up on their way to work and i think that 's a good thing for the city , ' he said			0
' it 's difficult to put a price on something like that			0
' if they had raised it , i think someone would have just put it back on			0
it 's already quite high so no matter how high it is , someone would just get a bigger ladder			0
' @entity169 wrote on the online petition : ' as a regular writer of tourist brochures , i note that much of what attracts visitors to @entity10 is the humour of its people			1
this is not something the council should be ashamed of			0
' and @entity181 added : ' the cone is more of a symbol of the defiant , fun spirit which @entity10 has always embodied and for which it 's renowned throughout the world			0

statue of @entity3 in @entity10 is repeatedly targeted by vandals
@entity191 planned to deter them by raising the size of the monument 's plinth
but officials backed down after online petition attracted 10,000 signatures
