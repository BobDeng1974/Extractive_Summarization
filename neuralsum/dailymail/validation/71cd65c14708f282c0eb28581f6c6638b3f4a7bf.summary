the @entity0 are to unveil a rival budget tomorrow in an unprecedented statement to @entity3 which will signal the end of the @entity5			1
@entity6 , the chief secretary to the treasury , will hold up a yellow budget box - mimicking the red leather case used by the chancellor - before setting out what his party 's tax and spending priorities after the election			1
he will promise to make tax dodging as unacceptable as drink - driving , increase the personal tax allowance to £ 12,500 and targeting the wealthy instead of cutting spending			1
@entity6 will hold his yellow budget box aloft tomorrow before delivering an unprecedented statement to the @entity22 it is understood the unique statement from the @entity25 had to be agreed with commons speaker @entity26 , and is likely to infuriate @entity27 for using government time to make a highly political speech			1
@entity30 has described the @entity31 as the ' last act of significant decision - making by this coalition government '			2
chancellor @entity35 is using his budget statement today to set out the official coalition government position for the last time before the election			1
but he has made clear that in a @entity40 government he would eradicate the deficit through spending cuts alone , without tax rises			1
this would include £ 12billion of cuts from the welfare budget , including a ban on under - 25s claiming housing benefit , restricting child benefit to three children and cutting the amount families can claim in handouts from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000			1
but all the changes to benefits have been blocked by the @entity0 , and are instead expected to be included in the @entity57 election manifesto when it is unveiled next month			1
on saturday mr @entity6 unveiled his bizarre yellow leather briefcase which he held aloft in an echo of the chancellor on the steps of @entity63			0
it was later auctioned off to a @entity0 activist for £ 1,500			1
it is expected to make another appearance tomorrow , before mr @entity6 gives his statement to the @entity22			2
the yellow box is designed to echo the red leather case used by @entity35 before travelling to the @entity22 to deliver his budget today mr @entity6 will rule out any extra increases to @entity73 , income tax or national insurance , but demand tax rises on the wealthy			1
he will use official @entity78 figures to back up his call for the deficit to be eradicated through 70 per cent spending cuts and 30 per cent tax rises			2
a senior @entity0 source said : we are going to set out what our spending plans will be for the next @entity3			1
' there are big chunks that the chancellor will say today which will be very much what the @entity57 ' plans will be			2
' in a speech at the @entity0 conference , mr @entity6 set out some of the measures which would be in a @entity0 budget			1
he promised a crackdown on tax dodgers , saying it should become as socially unacceptable as drink - driving			2
in the wake of the @entity102 scandal he said : ' as recent weeks have shown yet again , nothing upsets law - abiding taxpayers more than people who think they can evade paying the tax they owe			0
' paying the tax you owe is n't an optional extra - it 's a legal requirement			0
quite rightly , benefit fiddling is a crime and a social taboo			0
for too long , tax evasion has been seen by the rich and privileged more like a sport than the crime it is			0
' so in our future vision , there 'll be even more measures to crack down hard on the tax dodgers			0
' he continued : ' i want to see those who aid , abet , facilitate or encourage tax evasion hit as hard with criminal and financial penalties as the tax evaders themselves			0
that will be in our manifesto too			0
' mr @entity6 joined mr @entity35 and other @entity57 treasury ministers outside @entity63 this morning a @entity0 budget would include the party 's flagship policy of raising the income tax personal allowance to £ 12,500 and would involve ' balancing the books fairly , not on the backs of the working people on low pay '			1
he accused the @entity57 of wanting to ' cut for cut 's sake even after the books are balanced '			2
' a @entity40 with no heart , but two minds			0
one to stay in @entity145 , the other to leave , ' he said			0
' a @entity40 that wants to balance the books solely on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society			0
' the prospect of a @entity152 under a majority @entity40 government is grim indeed			0
and have n't we all groaned when they use their soulless mantra - long - term economic plan			0
the truth is their long - term economic plan means long - term economic pain for millions of families			0
