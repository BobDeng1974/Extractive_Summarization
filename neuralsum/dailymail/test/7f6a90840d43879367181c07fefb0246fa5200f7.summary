@entity0 wants @entity1 to be shown the ‘ respect he deserves ’ when he returns to the @entity2 in the blue of @entity4 on sunday			1
the problem with that is a decent chunk of @entity11 ’s supporters feel he does n’t deserve much			2
that became obvious on thursday , when one prominent fan called for the removal of a @entity1 banner from the @entity17			2
@entity1 returns to @entity11 on sunday and @entity0 hopes fans will give him a good reception @entity0 wants ' respect ' for the club 's former players and counts @entity1 as a man who deserves that @entity25 fans offer their good luck to @entity1 in 2011 , but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time extreme , perhaps , but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where @entity1 built his career , not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from @entity34 to @entity4 are still as clear as mud			1
any clarity , it seems , will have to wait			0
@entity0 was at his cryptic best on thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player , saying : ‘ we will have to discuss that one day			1
’ when pressed on whether it was his decision , he added : ‘ it ’s not as clean as that			0
i can not speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on sunday			2
’ at that point it was suggested to @entity0 that @entity1 chose not to come back and @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t know , i do n’t know			1
’ the @entity52 has previously claimed that by the time he knew @entity1 was available , a deal with @entity4 was virtually concluded — comments which jarred a little with the @entity56 ’s statement last summer that @entity11 ‘ decided not to take ’ their option			1
whatever , it would be ambitious for @entity1 to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on sunday			1
the midfielder set up @entity62 to seal a 2 - 0 victory for @entity4 against @entity11 earlier this season certainly , there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011			1
but @entity0 said : ‘ i want every player to be respected , and @entity1 when he comes to the @entity2 on sunday , ( i want him ) to be respected like he deserves			1
’ @entity0 added : ‘ the regret i have is that he wanted to leave here			2
this club and myself had a very positive influence on @entity1 ’s life , so i would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here			1
’ when he returns , it will be as a key part of the champions - elect and under a manager in @entity81 who has won seven and drawn five of his 12 meetings with @entity0			2
that clash , in itself , is a fascinating sub-plot to this fixture between the top and second - placed teams in the @entity90			0
@entity1 gets ahead of his now - team - mate @entity91 to score against @entity4 for @entity11 in 2010 playing down his poor record against @entity81 , @entity0 said : ‘ we have not always lost , first of all , in 12 attempts			1
‘ we have come close to beating them and they ’ve always had very strong teams			0
having said all of that , the result on sunday will be just down to the performance on the day			0
it ’s not a confrontation ( with @entity81 ) , it ’s a confrontation of two teams			0
i ’m not a great believer in history			0
i just think football is down to the fact the performance on the day will decide the game and the result			0
’ with seven straight league wins , @entity11 approach the fixture at speed , but @entity0 accepts it is unlikely @entity4 will lose a 10 - point advantage on the run - in			1
he said : ‘ we dropped points at the start of the season but since january we have been top of the ( form ) table			0
we want to continue to win and strengthen our position in second place because that ’s far from being done			0
' now what we can do is get closer to them and we have that opportunity			0
it still means even if we beat them , mathematically they are still in a very strong position			0
