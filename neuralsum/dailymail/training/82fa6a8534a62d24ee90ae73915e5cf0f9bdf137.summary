by @entity0 published : 08:41 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 13:28 est , 12 august 2013 from the @entity2 at @entity3 to the ancient marvels on display at the @entity6 , the world is full of wonders			2
but while most of us can be relied upon to enjoy them responsibly , it would seem there are some who simply ca n't be trusted			2
from the tourist who caught , cooked and ate one of the world 's rarest sea creatures to the travellers who defiled one of @entity21 's most spectacular beauty spots , @entity13 tracked down the visitors who definitely wo n't be invited back defaced : 14 - year - old @entity24 etched ' @entity24 was here ' on a 3,000 - year - old temple in @entity26 , @entity27 magnificent : the spectacular cliffs of @entity30 overlook the @entity31 on the west coast of @entity33 ruined : but a pair of @entity36 ' artists ' named ' mama ' and ' @entity37 ' decided they needed repainting the vandal in may , a teenager named @entity24 was found to have etched ' @entity24 was here ' on a 3,000 year old temple in @entity26 , @entity27			1
discovered by a micro-blogger - who promptly posted his findings online - the teen 's vandalising ways caused outrage across @entity47 and were widely condemned as disrespectful			1
' we want to apologise to the @entity27 people and to people who have paid attention to this case across @entity47 , ' @entity24 's mother told @entity55 paper , @entity54			1
@entity56 , who made the discovery , said : ' i felt embarrassed			2
it was my most unhappy moment in @entity27			0
' 14 - year - old @entity24 is n't the only @entity47 tourist to have caused outrage at home after putting doodles in the wrong place abroad			1
in march 2009 , a retired man from @entity66 infuriated his fellow countrymen after etching his name on a rock at @entity71 's @entity70			0
the graffiti artists towering 360ft above the @entity31 on the west coast of @entity75 , @entity21 's @entity73 attract more than 860,000 visitors every year			1
but in february , those visitors included a pair of @entity36 hitchhikers who chose to use their time at the @entity81 to create an 8ft tall mural on the rock near the spectacular @entity84			1
the pair , who call themselves ' mama ' and ' @entity37 ' , then uploaded a short film of them defacing the beauty spot on @entity90			0
according to the video , the duo are part of a group called @entity95 , an arts collective based in @entity97 who focus on graffiti , painting , urban photography , sculpture and short film			1
and not content with spray - painting the @entity73 , the pair then went on to deface other sites in @entity106 and @entity107			1
' the @entity109 and @entity110 have a @entity112 policy and would strongly encourage all visitors to support this , ' geologist dr @entity108 , told the @entity115 in the wake of the visit from the @entity36 pair			1
' as geologist for the @entity109 and @entity110 , my main concern is that this graffiti will lead to other copycat graffiti in more public and vulnerable areas and will detract from the much more important story that lies within the rocks			1
' broken : @entity127 , 56 , from @entity128 snapped the finger off this statue while trying to measure it furious : the @entity134 curator was outraged and it is believed the tourist has apologised for his silly behaviour the statue @entity138 last week , @entity127 , 56 , from @entity139 , @entity128 sparked fury across @entity141 after breaking the little finger off a 600 - year - old statue in @entity144			1
according to local reports , the man said he had n't intended to break the finger and had instead been attempting to compare his finger to that on the marble sculpture			0
the sculpture , which was created in the late 15th century by artist @entity152 , is housed in the @entity153 , which has now received an apology from the offending tourist			0
the museum 's head , @entity134 @entity156 , said : ' in a globalised world like ours , the fundamental rules for visiting a museum have been forgotten , that is , " do not touch the works			0
" ' the man who munched an endangered squid nothing beats a spot of fishing while on holiday but @entity134 tourist , @entity166 , found himself with more on his plate than he expected white on holiday in @entity176			0
during a snorkelling trip , @entity166 unearthed a rare ' hexapus ' - an extremely rare octopus with just six tentacles - but despite suspecting it might be something special , killed it and whisked it off to be cooked in a beachside taverna			2
the hexapus killed by mr @entity183 was only the second ever discovered - a fact mr @entity183 only found out when he returned home and asked a marine biologist friend			2
catch : @entity166 his daughter @entity188 , ten , and son @entity190 , six admire the six legged octopus or hexapus which they found while on holiday in @entity176 fishing : the specimen was pulled from the sea by @entity134 citizen @entity166 as he went snorkelling in @entity176 @entity198 : the chef refused to cook it for him but he fried it himself and served it with tomato and lemon a repentant mr @entity183 said : â€˜ it tasted just like a normal octopus but now i feel really bad			0
when we caught it , there was nothing to suggest it was any different or had been damaged			0
' i thought it had been born with six tentacles			0
we go to @entity176 every year and when we catch an octopus , we do the same thing so we just did not think about it			2
' i wanted to find out more , but there was no internet where we were			0
i then called my friend who is a biologist and he told me it was true and i was horrified			0
' the callous men who manhandled a @entity224 for the majority of travellers , just catching a glimpse of a dolphin is thrill enough			1
but it would seem that not everyone agrees			0
when a dolphin was hit by a boat and washed towards the shore in the @entity237 province of @entity47 , far from attempting to help the stricken animal , a group of tourists decided to pose with it instead			1
the dying creature was lifted up and manhandled , while the male travellers pulled muscleman poses around it			2
when it finally died , reports in the local @entity245 revealed that it had perished from ' excessive bleeding ' - not helped by the antics of the men			1
fury : the shocking pictures caused outrage when they were posted on a @entity47 social networking site cruel : these travellers decided to pose for pictures with a dying dolphin rather than helping it the photos of the incident , which took place in june , were then posted on the @entity47 social networking site , @entity262 , and caused fury among other users			1
' when even the basic respect of life is lost , i just want to say , how can i be proud of you , @entity47 ? ' one user said			0
' @entity270 , as highly evolved mammals , have an iq only a little lower than humans			0
but those people in the pictures are worse than pigs , ' wrote another .			0
