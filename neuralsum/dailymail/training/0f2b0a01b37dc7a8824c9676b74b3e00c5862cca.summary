@entity0 : @entity1 became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco yesterday when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks			1
he is pictured eating a pastry - based product in 2010 @entity1 became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco yesterday when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks			1
the prime minister spoke out following public anger at the chancellor ’s decision to slap a 20 per cent vat surcharge on hot pasties sold by high street firms such as @entity16			1
he boasted that he loved @entity18 pasties in order to seize a public relations advantage after critics accused the government of being out of touch with ordinary people			1
but his claims , at a @entity27 press conference , that he last ate a pasty at an outlet of the @entity30 at @entity32 station were quickly exposed as untrue			1
@entity33 revealed the @entity35 outlet was closed down in march 2007 – five years ago to the month			2
and in further embarrassment for the pm , it emerged that a @entity39 pasty booth on the northbound platform of the station was closed down on friday – two days after the tax increase was announced			1
the prime minister ’s alleged ‘ porky pies ’ were quickly branded ‘ @entity0 ’ in @entity46 and provoked a feeding frenzy of exchanges			1
mr @entity1 was forced to speak out after anger caused by @entity49 ’s appearance before the treasury select committee on tuesday			1
the chancellor told @entity53 hot pasties that are cooled down before they are sold would not be subject to @entity13 , while hot pasties would be – and said he could not remember eating a @entity16 product			1
mr @entity1 made an impassioned defence of the plans , arguing they would create a level playing field between bakers and pasty outlets , which are currently vat exempt , and other fast food joints such as @entity64 ’s and fish and chip shops , which have to pay the tax			1
but he was caught out when he gave an overly detailed account of his last pasty meal			2
‘ i ’m a pasty eater myself , ’ he said at an event about the @entity71			0
‘ i go to @entity35 on holiday			0
i love a hot pasty			1
sausage drole : @entity76 shares a joke with @entity78 and @entity79 as they paid a visit to a @entity16 outlet solidarity : the @entity85 leader shakes hands with staff at the branch of @entity16 in @entity89 , @entity90 ‘ i think the last one i bought was from the @entity30			1
i seem to remember i was in @entity32 station at the time			1
the choice was to have one of their small ones or their large ones			0
i ’ve got a feeling i opted for the large one and very good it was too			0
’ but within minutes @entity33 had confirmed that mr @entity1 ’s memory was faulty			0
@entity101 mps privately compared mr @entity1 ’s gaffe to that of @entity104 , who was dogged for years by the apocryphal story that he claimed to have seen the @entity108 footballer @entity107 play , when he had retired when mr @entity104 was four years old			0
@entity85 raced to cash in on the government ’s embarrassment			1
@entity76 , shadow chancellor @entity78 and treasury spokesman @entity79 all attended a photo opportunity at a @entity16 bakers in @entity89 , @entity90			1
labour aides gleefully told journalists that mr @entity76 bought eight sausage rolls for £ 4.70 – which will cost £ 5.64 when the tax is imposed in october			1
mr @entity76 said : ‘ the government is now putting 20 per cent on the cost of pasties , sausage rolls , and the chancellor ’s excuse ? well , he says you can buy them cold and you can avoid the tax			1
it just shows how out of touch this government is and it shows that we ’ve got a budget that is hitting millions of people while cutting taxes for millionaires			0
’ more than 2,000 people signed a no 10 petition calling for ministers to axe the tax and a company began selling t - shirts bearing the slogan do n’t @entity139			0
@entity27 officials rushed to assure the nation that while mr @entity1 may have been caught out on the details , he is a firm pasty fan			0
‘ it ’s a near ritual on trips that the @entity9 and his aides have an end - of - day pasty on the train back , ’ one said			1
pasty makers called on ministers to change their plans			0
@entity154 , of the @entity30 , thanked the pm for his endorsement but added : ‘ we would have hoped that if he had been rubbing shoulders with our customers he ’d better understand the impact that this move will have on them , and our sector and all the great suppliers within it			2
’ snack time : between them the three politicians bought eight sausage rolls - with mr @entity78 apparently enjoying the lion 's share why the change ? in the 1980s @entity101 chancellor @entity172 put vat on hot food			1
but he exempted freshly baked products , such as pastries and pies , that were still warm from the bakery oven			0
@entity49 considered this a loophole that needed closing			0
what food is covered ? all food – pasties , sausage rolls , toasted sandwiches and rotisserie chickens – that is sold hot in any shop will have to charge the 20 per cent sales tax			1
hot takeaway restaurants and fish and chip shops already charge vat			2
what ’s the official definition of ‘ hot ’ ? the @entity195 guide says food is hot if it is ‘ above ambient air temperature when provided to the customer ’			2
this seems pretty straightforward – until you consider the @entity202 weather , which has great variations in temperature throughout the year and in different parts of the country			0
so a sausage roll sold at 20c in summer would be below the ‘ ambient air temperature ’ and vat - free			2
in the winter it would be warmer than the surrounding air and therefore liable for vat			0
equally perverse , if it was a hot and sunny day in the @entity214 and cold and wet in the @entity215 , customers would , in theory , pay different prices for the same sausage roll			0
to take this to its most absurd , someone waiting at the front of a queue for a fresh sausage roll might pay vat because it is still hot , while someone at the back might pay less because it has gone cold			2
how will the taxman determine how much of the food sold is hot and how much cold ? one possible solution is that revenue inspectors will consider factors that affect ‘ ambient temperature ’ , such as local weather patterns and seasonal changes , and make a one - off annual assessment of what proportion of hot and cold items a shop will sell over the period of a year			2
they might decide , for example , that 60 per cent of sales are hot and 40 per cent cold			2
the retailer would then be given a vat bill based on this calculation			0
how have takeaway food firms reacted ? sales at bakery chains such as @entity16 and @entity249 have soared in recent years			1
but the new tax will mean many prices rising by 20 per cent and not surprisingly they are trying to force the @entity195 into a rethink			2
they say food that is freshly baked on the premises and sold while still cooling down should continue to be free of vat			2
it says these products should be treated differently tax-wise from food like burgers and kebabs which are designed to be served hot			0
are there other practical difficulties ? bakers , supermarkets and even corner shops might need to spend extra money on new cabinets to keep separately hot items ( which are vat liable ) and the same cold product ( which does n’t attract @entity13 )			1
are there exemptions to the hot food tax ? yes			0
freshly - baked bread ( which is considered a basic food item ) will not carry @entity13			0
however , tax accountants predict a raft of court cases involving battles over the exact definition of freshly - baked bread			0
for example , a loaf is easy to identify – but what about croissants , scones , pain au chocolat and other such products ? how much will be raised from this extra vat ? officials say the changes ( which come into operation on october 1 ) will raise £ 50million in the current financial year , rising to £ 120million in 2016/7			0
