every man , woman and child should be regularly weighed to halt ‘ skyrocketing ’ levels of obesity , experts believe			1
the @entity6 has warned that the spiralling cost of treating obesity could ‘ break the @entity10 ’ – and the threat is magnified by people being blind to their size			1
to millions of @entity13 , being dangerously overweight is now simply normal			1
fear : the @entity6 has warned that the spiralling cost of treating obesity could ‘ break the @entity10 ’ – and the threat is magnified by people being blind to their size in its annual report , the forum calls for regular monitoring of the weight of all adults			1
and it wants all young children to be weighed annually			1
regularly logging measurements would allow doctors to spot those whose weight is creeping up – and catch them before they become dangerously fat			2
with obesity costing the @entity13 almost £ 45billion a year , and @entity30 the only @entity32 country to have a bigger obesity problem than @entity13 , the @entity6 says we have now reached a ‘ critical point ’			1
the @entity38 ’s @entity37 report paints a bleak picture of @entity13 ’s obesity battle			1
obesity levels have doubled in the last two decades and today 67 per cent of men overweight or obese			1
women are not far behind , with fewer than half a normal , healthy weight			0
the forum warns the problem is more serious still among children			2
figures published in december and described a tragedy by the chief executive of @entity52 , show that 22.5 per cent of boys and girls are overweight or obese at the age of four or five			2
by the time they reach 10 or 11 , the figure is 33.5 per cent			0
children are weighed on starting primary school and again on leaving – but the @entity6 says annual weigh - in are essential if weight gain is to be caught early and nipped in the bud			1
spokesman @entity64 says the current system has provided lots of data about childhood obesity – but the long gap between measurements means it has done nothing for individual children			2
the @entity6 wants people 's weights to be monitored to cut the cost of obesity on the @entity10 mr @entity64 , who is also honorary chairman of the @entity81 , said : ‘ if a child is weighed aged four and not weighed again until they are ten , you have got six years where that child is putting on weight			1
‘ a good proportion of our children are getting fatter and fatter			2
’ mr @entity64 also wants @entity87 to routinely weigh all their adult patients			0
the sheer numbers involved mean annual weigh - ins would not be practical but it may be possible to put each patient on the scales every three years			0
currently , weigh - ins are done on an ad - hoc basis			0
women who are on the pill , people who need repeat prescriptions of certain drugs , those having heart check - ups are among those who will be put on the scales but there is no systematic plan in place			0
as a result , some patients can go years without their weight being recorded by their family doctor			0
other said that while tracking weight gain is important , it is n’t necessarily a job for @entity87			0
for instance , it could be done by practice nurses or by community slimming clubs			0
the problem is compounded by many people being blind to their weight problem			0
a @entity122 poll found that only 6 per cent of @entity13 consider themselves to be obese – despite the true figure being around 25 per cent			2
dame @entity124 , the chief medical officer , has warned that millions of @entity13 do not realise they are overweight because it is now seen as being normal			1
she said that high street shops are exacerbating the problem by altering size labels to make shoppers think they are thinner than they actually are			0
today ’s report also calls for routine weighing of pregnant women , clearer labelling of food and highlights the growing price gap between healthy and unhealthy foods			0
the @entity6 also warns that without extra training for @entity87 on how to broach the subject of obesity and better access to specialist weight loss services , a new national anti-obesity drive could fail			1
announced last month , it will involve gps identifying patients whose weight puts them at risk of diabetes			0
professor @entity147 , chairman of the @entity6 , said : ‘ obesity levels have skyrocketed in the last 20 years and as a country we need to do more			1
‘ we should be under no illusions			0
‘ obesity represents one of the most serious threats to the health of the @entity13 population and has the potential of breaking the @entity10			1
’ last night , @entity158 , chief executive of @entity159 , said : ‘ rising obesity is the fastest growing health threat facing us as individuals and as a nation			2
‘ so the @entity10 , schools , parents , employers and the food industry now need to get our collective act together			2
’ he added that new focus on people at risk of diabetes will be ‘ ground - breaking ’ .			0
