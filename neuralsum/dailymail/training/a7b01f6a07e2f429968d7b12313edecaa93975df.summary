@entity0 died of severe smoke inhalation after he tried to rescue his two children from a fire caused by a faulty fridge freezer millions of dangerous electrical products are sitting in homes across the country despite being recalled for repairs by manufacturers			1
the problem reflects the fact that the recall system for appliances , everything from fridge freezers and tumble dryers to chargers , is hopelessly inadequate			2
manufacturers face accusations they are slow to recall products that are known to have a fault , while there is no effective system to alert the owners of dangerous products			0
generally , the companies will put a warning on their own website , which is difficult to find , or they might advertise in a newspaper on a few occasions			2
a recent inquest in @entity32 heard how @entity0 , 36 , died after suffering severe smoke inhalation when he rescued his two children from a fire caused by a faulty @entity35 fridge freezer			1
the @entity37 manufacturer had been warned about problems with the appliance but decided not to recall it until after the tragedy in the autumn of november 2010			0
subsequently , the coroner recommended far stronger penalties for companies who fail to recall suspect products , including a possible prison sentence			0
the problem has been highlighted by @entity49 , a charity which runs its own website listing recalled household appliances			1
it said some four million products have been officially recalled over the last four years , yet the majority of these are still sitting in homes creating the risk of a fire or electric shock			1
it said some 228 different electrical products have been recalled – including seven types of fridge , four washing machines and seven hairdryers – yet typically only 10 - 20per cent are ever returned or repaired			1
the campaign to raise awareness is being supported by @entity69 who had a fire at his home near @entity72 , which was caused by a fault in his @entity75 dishwasher			2
‘ it was lucky that i happened to walk into the kitchen as the dishwasher caught fire so i could put it out quickly , ’ he said			1
‘ but my young son was asleep upstairs and i would otherwise have been in bed at that time too			0
it does n’t bear thinking about what could have happened			0
the product was later recalled as a whole batch			2
‘ it is important for everyone to know that if they are told their item has been recalled it is going to be for a very good reason , and even if the fault is not immediately life - threatening it is not worth the risk keeping it in your home			0
’ faulty electrical goods are placing the lives of millions of people at risk according to a new charity a spokesman for the charity , @entity108 , said : ‘ whilst the chances of a faulty product causing serious damage are small , the risk is still there and returning a faulty product , or ordering its repair , is very easy to do			1
‘ we ’re working with manufacturers to improve the recall system but in the meantime we urge everyone to do anything they can to look after themselves , whether that ’s registering a product when you buy it or keeping an eye out for recall notices			0
‘ we ’d also encourage everyone to use our free online checker , to see if you have any recalled items in your home today			0
