by @entity1 reporter published : 17:50 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 15 december 2013 along the winding muddy waters of the @entity4 where he once patrolled for communist insurgents on a naval gunboat , secretary of state @entity2 turned his sights sunday on a new enemy : climate change			1
in this remote part of southern @entity16 , rising sea waters , erosion and the impact of upstream dam development on the @entity14 are proving a more serious threat than the @entity19 guerrillas that @entity2 battled as a young lieutenant in 1968 and 1969			1
' decades ago on these very waters , i was one of many who witnessed the difficult period in our shared history , ' @entity2 told a group of young professionals gathered near a dock at the riverfront village of @entity32			2
a trip back in time : secretary of state @entity2 visited the @entity4 during an official visit - his first time back since he served in the @entity37 @entity2 commanded a swift boat as a young officer and received three purple hearts , the @entity41 and the @entity42 for his acts of courage ' today on these waters i am bearing witness to how far our two nations have come together and we are talking about the future and that 's the way it ought to be , ' he said			1
that future , especially for the water - dependent economy of the millions who live in the @entity4 , is in jeopardy , he said , pledging a $ 17 million contribution to a program that will help the region 's rice producers , shrimp and crab farmers and fisherman adapt to potential changes caused by higher sea levels that bring salt water into the delicate ecosystem			0
@entity2 also said he would make it a personal priority to ensure that none of the six countries that share the @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity16 - and depend on it for the livelihoods of an estimated 60 million people exploits the river at the expense of the others			1
in a pointed reference to @entity72 , which plans several @entity85 projects that could seriously affect downstream populations , @entity2 said : ' no one country has a right to deprive another country of a livelihood , an ecosystem and its capacity for life itself that comes from that river			1
that river is a global asset , a treasure that belongs to the region			0
' the @entity4 's resources must ' benefit people not just in one country , not just in the country where the waters come first , but in every country that touches this great river			0
' though @entity2 was keen to focus on the future , his return to the @entity4 , his first since 1969 despite 13 previous postwar trips to @entity16 , was clearly a homecoming of sorts			1
@entity2 , pictured with dr @entity111 , said life on the river hadn # t changed much in the four and a half decades since he was last there @entity2 , pictured center , saw active combat during his service - and it turned him into an anti-war activist once he got home as @entity2 's boat eased off a jetty onto the @entity123 , the secretary of state told his guide : ' i 've been on this river many times			1
' asked how he felt about returning to the scene of his wartime military service for the first time , @entity2 replied : ' weird , and it 's going to get weirder			2
' on this tour , @entity2 was clad in drab olive cargo pants , a blue - and - white plaid long - sleeved shirt and sunglasses instead of the uniform he wore as a @entity137 officer			1
in a new role and new garb , @entity2 revisited the delta 's rivers that made a vivid impression on him as a young lieutenant and eventually turned him against the war			1
standing next to the captain and surveying the brown water and muddy banks , @entity2 recalled the smell of burning firewood as his boat passed through small fishing villages where the aroma has n't changed in 50 years			2
at one point , a family in a sampan traveling in the opposite direction smiled and waved			0
@entity2 waved back , and noticing the family had a dog on board , remarked with a smile : ' i had a dog , too			2
' @entity19 was the abbreviation for the @entity19 , forces fighting the @entity16 and their @entity167 allies			2
before his remarks in @entity32 , @entity2 visited a general store and bought candy for a group of children , delighting them with a few words in @entity16			1
while the ringing of cell phones may have replaced the thunder of artillery fire , back on the boat @entity2 looked out at the jungle canopy that rises just off the riverbank , swept his arm and remarked : ' it has n't changed all that much			0
a lot of it is same old , same old			0
' @entity2 is hoping to shore up relations with @entity16 as the @entity167 engages in a standoff with @entity72 over territorial claims in the @entity188 ' this was what we called a " free - fire zone , " ' he said			1
' the @entity19 were pretty much everywhere			0
' @entity2 first set foot in @entity16 44 years ago after volunteering for service because , as he has said , ' it was the right thing to do			1
' he was decorated with three @entity196 , a @entity42 and a @entity41 for fighting in a conflict that he came to despise and call a ' colossal mistake , ' one that profoundly influenced his political career and strategic view			0
' when i came home after two tours of duty , i decided that the same sense of service demanded something more of me , ' he wrote in his 2003 book , ' a call to service , ' as he was unsuccessfully campaigning for the presidency in the 2004 election			0
' the lesson i learned from @entity16 is that you quickly get into trouble if you let foreign policy or national security policy get too far adrift from our values as a country and as a people			0
' he arrived back on saturday for his 14th trip to the country since the war 's end but his first in 13 years , determined to bolster the remarkable rapprochement that he had encouraged and helped engineer as a senator in the 1990s			0
in the city he first knew as @entity229 , the capital of the former @entity16 , @entity2 met saturday with members of the business community and entrepreneurs to talk up the @entity233 , a broad trade agreement that the @entity167 is now negotiating with @entity16 and nine other @entity236 countries			1
to take full advantage of the deal 's economic opportunities , @entity2 said @entity16 , which has been widely criticized for its human rights record , must embrace changes that include a commitment to a more open society , the free exchange of ideas and education			1
he made the comments after attending @entity248 at @entity249 , built in the 1880s and 1890s under @entity253 colonial rule , in a bid to show support for the tenuous freedom of worship in @entity16			2
@entity16 authorities have been criticized for harassing , prosecuting and jailing @entity260 clergy			0
in talks with @entity16 officials in @entity263 on monday , @entity2 was expected to make the case that respect for human rights , particularly freedom of speech and religion , is essential to improved relations with the @entity167			2
he also was expected to raise the issue of political prisoners whom the @entity167 would like to see released			0
the chief focus of the discussions , however , was expected to be maritime security and territorial disputes in the @entity188 .			0

secretary of state returned to the @entity16 river basin he patrolled as a young @entity137 lieutenant
@entity2 visited @entity16 to shore up support in stand off with @entity72 over @entity188
