by @entity0 published : 18:31 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 4 july 2012 she is drinking in the beauty of one of the most celebrated images of the @entity6 countryside			2
and let us hope this young art lover had a good , long look			2
last night there were fears that @entity14 ’s masterpiece the lock could disappear forever from public view after it was sold to a private buyer for £ 22.4million			2
and with no obligation for the new owner to keep it on display , it may be the last time we have the chance to see for ourselves the genius of each brush stroke			2
the landscape , part of a succession constable nicknamed ‘ the six - footers ’ , and one of his favourites , was up for auction for only the second time in its history			1
back in 1824 , mp @entity54 paid 150 guineas for it , the equivalent of around £ 20,000 today			0
keeping it quiet : bidders on phones try to stay discreet			0
the painting went to an anonymous bidder after taking two minutes to reach its final price then in 1990 it was sold for £ 10.8million to @entity66 - born billionaire @entity65 and his wife @entity67 , a former miss @entity68			0
that was a record for a @entity25 work of art and it was not surpassed until 2006 , when a view of @entity74 by @entity14 ’s rival @entity75 was bought for £ 20.5million			1
three months ago @entity78 ’s iconic masterpiece @entity79 became the most expensive work of art to be sold at auction , for the dollar equivalent of £ 74million			1
last night at @entity21 , @entity83 took only two minutes to reach its comparatively modest price and was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder			1
the sale is a joint record for an @entity89 at @entity21 , making the @entity91 one of the most expensive @entity25 paintings ever sold			1
@entity93 @entity6 : the @entity91 , like another of his great works , the @entity96 ( pictured ) , epitomises @entity14 's lifelong love of @entity98 and was the fifth of six landscapes he painted of the @entity101 although its original price tag has multiplied nearly 140,000 times since it was first sold at the @entity105 , counting on it for a massive return on the 1990 price was a gamble			2
some experts calculated that it has actually lost value in real terms over the last 22 years			0
the @entity91 , like another of his great works , the @entity96 , epitomises @entity14 ’s lifelong love of the @entity98 countryside			0
the lock was the fifth of six landscapes he painted of the @entity101			0
it depicts a figure struggling to open a canal gate at @entity120 near @entity121 to allow a barge to pass			0
after it was sold in 1990 to the @entity125 family it had been housed in @entity127 ’s @entity126			0
last night art expert @entity128 confirmed the painting had probably gone to a @entity25 private buyer			1
‘ constable does not cross borders , ’ he said			0
‘ a sunbaked scene in @entity98 is too @entity25 for the international market			1
it is most likely to have gone to a @entity25 private buyer as our museums do n’t have that kind of money			1

@entity25 museums could *n't* afford to compete at @entity21 's auction
