by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 fan says his new £ 90 kit has been ' ruined ' after his favourite player @entity5 switched squad numbers			1
eight - year - old @entity7 saved up his birthday money to buy the new @entity3 home shirt as soon as it hit shops last month			1
and he even paid to have the name of his idol @entity5 printed on the back and his squad number , 44 , on the shorts			1
but a month later , he swapped to 11 but just a few weeks later , the young @entity25 winger switched to number 11			1
the number was left vacant after @entity28 ' retirement at the end of last season			1
however , the club did not inform supporters of the planned change until sunday , august 17 - exactly a month after the new home shirt had been released			2
@entity5 has played under number 44 for three years after joining the club as a 16 - year - old			1
his young fan @entity38 has now refused to wear the @entity40 strip , which cost him £ 93.20 in total , fearing he may be teased about it			1
and despite pleas from his mother @entity46 , the club 's @entity43 have told him ca n't have a new shirt , as any printing is done at the shirt owner 's risk			1
mrs @entity51 , 45 , has now hit out at the club saying they have let the boy down			0
the mother - of - three , who lives in @entity56 , @entity57 , said : ' he 's united mad			2
he has spent all summer at football camp and it 's all he ever talks about			0
@entity60 dashed : @entity38 had spent months waiting to get his hands on the new kit but he says it is now ' ruined ' ' he could n't wait to get the new shirt and kept asking when i was ordering it			2
' he 'd only worn it two or three times when we found out he [ @entity5 ] had changed number			2
' we emailed and asked them if he could change it and they said no because there was a disclaimer with all printing			0
' a few weeks ago the club replaced a shirt where someone had spelt @entity79 wrong			0
' yet we have done nothing wrong and have been left out of pocket			0
if we had any idea it was going to change i would have made him wait rather than see him disappointed			0
' last - minute change : @entity5 joined the club at 16 in 2011 and played under the number 44 until this summer a short - sleeved home shirt from the @entity92 costs £ 42			1
but additional lettering costs £ 9.95			0
mrs @entity51 also bought shorts , priced at £ 20 , with an additional cost of £ 6 to print the number 44			1
and socks , which cost £ 12			0
she says the system needs to change as @entity38 is ' devastated '			0
' @entity38 wanted the third kit as well but i 've put a stop to that now			0
i 'm not going to let him spend money on a shirt that could be out of date straight away			2
' however , a spokesman for the club insisted that notices were prominently displayed throughout the store making clear that squad numbers were not final until they are registered with the @entity111 .			0

@entity7 , 8 , spent £ 93.20 saved from birthday money on new kit
*personalised* it with name of favourite player @entity5 and his number 44
but a month after kit went on sale , the club *announced* he is now number 11
@entity5 took the number after it was left vacant by now - retired @entity28
the club 's *megastore* has refused to alter the now out - of - date shirt
