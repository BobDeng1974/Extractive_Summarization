@entity0 tells a fun story about the day earlier this year when he took his extraordinary brand of golf to a tournament in @entity5 and a spectator felt compelled to confront him			1
it was the sort of conversation many on - lookers have considered but not entered			2
@entity0 had just missed the 18th green in the second - tier event , which would once have meant a neurotic panic for a man whose problems with chipping moved him to tears in the past			1
worse than that , the thought of taking those delicate little shots used to make him want to quit the game altogether			1
@entity0 is nicknamed the ' @entity22 ' by the @entity23 for playing chip shots one handed but those were the days before he devised the unique technique that made the @entity5 chap take notice			1
the man the @entity23 calls the ' @entity22 ' put a single hand on his club and took a little swing			1
' i was chipping one - handed and it was actually one of the rare times these days when i messed it up , ' he says			1
' i had a bad lie and it was a hard shot			2
but this @entity5 guy has seen me playing with one hand and obviously thought i was messing around or joking or something			1
' i was walking off the green and he actually confronted me and asked , ' is this for real ? ' and motioned one - handed			1
' in golf , walking up and criticising a pro 's technique just does n't really happen			1
' i guess he was a bit taken aback by it			2
but believe me , if i was playing two - handed the shot would have probably been worse and certainly i would not be out there			1
' these days , ' out there ' means the @entity23			1
@entity0 recently won full playing privileges to play on the big stage , a charming and unconventional triumph for a 30 - year - old from @entity55 who was an @entity57 international in his early twenties as an amateur and a ' quivering wreck ' with the yips a couple of years later			1
@entity0 came across the technique while going through struggles with his short game now , whenever he finds himself within 40 yards of the pin but off the green , he will pitch or chip one - handed , be it from a bunker , rough or fairway			1
many golfers have their kinks , but none quite like this			2
he is the first player in the @entity23 's history to play in such a way			1
the titters and sniggers have followed him for four years since his ' eureka moment '			2
but as @entity0 , who turned professional in 2009 , says , ' people can laugh yet this is a results business and this has saved me '			1
the cruel irony is that as a young international with two hands on the club , his short game was his strong point			1
' i was a late starter and only picked up a club for the first time at 14 , ' he says			2
' within a year my handicap went from 26 to 15 and then in another year it went to five			2
' i was improving so fast			2
my short game was definitely the best bit			1
i was such a weedy kid i could do nothing off the tee but my chipping and pitching was so precise			0
' when i first got in the @entity57 squad , in 2007 , it was my forte			0
then , possibly because i put so much attention on my long game , it all went horribly , horribly wrong			2
before he had the yips , @entity0 's short game was his strongest attribute as a young golfer ' it would start with one duffed chip			1
before long it was getting in my head			0
golf is one of those games you play best with a clear head and here i was thinking about technique			2
' the more i thought the worse it got			0
in time , i had the yips — i was practically terrified every time i missed the green because i knew i 'd mess up the chip			1
i remember going to @entity126 with the @entity57 squad			0
i was two or three under par and missed a green			0
' what followed was like watching a tennis match with me going hitting through the green , walking across and then hitting it back through to the other side			0
' i just could not get it to stop and ended up with eight or nine for the hole			0
i can also remember the club championships here ( at @entity137 ) in 2008			0
i was cruising with a three - shot lead with five to play			0
' i had a 350 - yard hole , my drive left me 70 and then i hit two yards with my wedge			0
then i did the same again			0
i barely dragged myself over the line			0
' when i 'd go away with the @entity57 squad , i 'd have to do these skills competitions against brilliant players who are excellent professionals now like @entity147			0
' he would knock them stiff from 70 yards and i 'd miss the green			0
' in 2009 , i was so low			0
i was upstairs at home and tears were welling in my eyes			0
' i was saying to my dad , ' i ca n't do this anymore '			0
we quite often did n't see eye to eye because he pushed me so hard but he put his arm around my shoulder and said , ' i do believe you can do it			0
do n't give up '			0
' @entity147 , who palmer played with for @entity57 , pictured celebrating 2013 @entity165 victory @entity0 pictured in action at the @entity167 during the 2014 @entity169 season a year later , at a tournament in @entity172 , frustration finally got the better of him			1
he approached a chip shot he simply felt unable to play and instead hit it one - handed			1
it went within an inch of the hole			0
' i was playing a week later on the @entity177 in @entity178 , ' he says , ' and was having a pitching contest with my friend , @entity180 , and i was doing it one - handed			1
' i was going over all my problems with him and saying how i could do it just fine one - handed			2
it was a bit of a eureka moment — he just said , " this is a results game			2
if one - handed works for you , who cares if you feel stupid doing it			2
" the next few weeks i played the golf of my life			0
' by the start of this year , @entity0 had reached the @entity169			1
more than £ 85,000 in winnings and a tournament victory has landed him on the @entity23			1
' people give me some double - takes , ' he says			0
' you get some strange looks and there was that @entity5 guy			0
i guess it does look crazy			0
' but would i be playing on the @entity23 with two hands on the club ? no chance			1
people can laugh if they want but i 'm pinching myself			0

@entity0 has *qualified* for the @entity23 from the @entity169
he is called the ' @entity22 ' for playing chip shots one handed
@entity0 discovered the technique trying to *overcome* short game yips
