cllr @entity0 was found guilty of bringing @entity1 and @entity2 into disrepute with her remarks a @entity6 councillor is to undergo diversity training after offending ethnic minorities with her claim that golliwogs are ' nostalgic , not racist '			1
cllr @entity0 was found guilty of bringing @entity1 and @entity2 into disrepute with her remarks			1
in august , @entity12 said she thought golliwogs were ' nostalgic , not racist '			1
and she dismissed complaints against a city homestore selling golliwog placemats as ' political correctness gone too far '			1
however , a panel of three fellow councillors cleared the 72 - year - old of failing to treat others with respect and breaching the @entity22			0
the board - sitting in a closed hearing on thursday - also recommended that all councillors should undergo diversity training in the future			0
her comments provoked four ' separate but similar ' complaints from three people and the council 's @entity32			1
one complainant asked for an apology from @entity12 while another said they wished to see her expelled from the council			1
speaking after the meeting , @entity12 said the issue should never have progressed to a hearing and was a waste of taxpayers ' money			1
@entity12 dismissed complaints against a city homestore selling golliwog placemats as ' political correctness gone too far ' the hearing was originally scheduled for november 28 but was dramatically postponed when @entity12 fell down a flight of stairs on her way to the meeting			1
she was carried to hospital wearing a neck brace and on a spinal board			0
yesterday 's hearing - lasting more than five - and - a - half hours - was also attended by a number of senior council staff			1
the golliwog was a character in children 's books in the late 19th century and usually depicted as a friendly rag doll			1
@entity65 struck upon the character and invented the name which at the time had no negative connotations			0
in 1894 the first story , @entity70 , the doll was initially described as ' a horrid sight , the blackest gnome ' , but turns out in fact to be good , loveable and brave , with a ' kind face '			0
however , the word ' wog ' began to be used as a derogatory word for black people			2
first popularised during @entity81 , it was uttered by some @entity83 soldiers as a slur against @entity85			0
by the 1960s , both the use of the term ' golliwog ' and the dolls themselves were under increasing attack			2
in 1983 , the @entity91 banned @entity93 's products from its jurisdiction , and in 1988 the character was no longer used in tv advertising			2
they included a monitoring officer , head of complaints , and head of democratic services			2
a council report on the proceedings will not be made available to the public until early next week			0
@entity12 , of the @entity107 and @entity108 ward , said : ' they threw out the two most serious charges but said i was guilty of breaching the code of conduct			1
' i am pleased they have let me off on the other two serious charges but very disappointed they have judged i broke the code of conduct			0
' i do n't think it should have got this far , it was a waste of taxpayers ' money and officers ' time			0
' i apologised to anyone who was upset by my comments and that should have been the end of it			0
' i understand the reasons why they had it behind closed doors but there were a lot of upset people outside the meeting that were angry it was n't held in public			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said the incident highlighted the ' need for training and awareness raising among all councillors on equalities issues '			2
this will form part of member development in the future , she added .			0
