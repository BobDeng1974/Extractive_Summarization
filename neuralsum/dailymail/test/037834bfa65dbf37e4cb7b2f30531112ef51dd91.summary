@entity0 has begun communication with the @entity2 in the aim of being rewarded with @entity5 gold from 2011 after champion @entity6 was exposed as a drug cheat			1
in january @entity6 was found to have provided a positive sample for a prohibited steroid at the @entity10			1
the @entity12 anti-doping agency issued a backdated ban and annulled her records from 15 august 2009 to 14 august 2011 – just 16 days before she beat @entity15 by 129 points in the heptathlon in @entity18 , @entity19			1
@entity6 ( left ) failed a drugs test two years before beating @entity0 in @entity19 in 2011 @entity21 believes it is unfair that @entity6 was banned but allowed to keep her world title @entity24 has written to the @entity2 to ask shy @entity6 has been allowed to keep her world title @entity21 , then the defending world champion , had to settle for silver			1
the following year the @entity26 took gold in memorable scenes at @entity29 , with @entity6 third			1
@entity6 's ban is due to expire on june 21 – in time for this year ’s @entity10 in @entity32 in august and , of course , the @entity34 in @entity35			1
‘ obviously i 'm not happy about how the ban has been handled , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ i ca n’t really understand it myself			1
i 've spoken to @entity38 and the @entity2 and i am putting my faith to look into it a bit more			1
‘ i ca n't understand how that is fair			1
it 's so frustrating – although frustration is n't a strong enough word , because you train hard for all those years and then people do things like that			2
it does n't seem like she has served a ban			2
‘ i think we need to be strict and if you are cheating , you 're out			2
i do n't think you should be allowed to come back and keep your medals			2
it does n't seem fair			2
’ research carried out by the @entity58 in october 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids for years , even decades after the moment at which they were taken			2
@entity21 suggested she may have suspected @entity6 but could not have allowed herself to think about anything other than her competition			1
‘ you might think things but you ca n't really say anything , you just get on with what you are doing and you ca n't cast aspersions until something comes out , really , ’ she said			2
‘ that was a really funny competition for me because it was the year before the @entity73 and i felt really ready			0
‘ i just thought i could win the gold medal , and i came away with a silver			0
i was thinking , “ is this how it will go into the @entity73 ? ” ‘ it gave me that extra push in a way , having that silver			0
but at the same time i could have been double world champion			0
it ’s a weird one			0
but i definitely want that medal			0
we ’ve had communications with the @entity2 just to see how that ban works			0
’ @entity21 praised the work done to uncover transgressions , such as the @entity92 documentary about institutionalised doping in @entity12			0
but admitted it left a ‘ dampener ’ on the sport			0
earlier this year @entity12 's athletics head coach @entity97 resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences			1
@entity6 celebrates the gold medal she took ahead of @entity21 a year before the @entity29 @entity103 ( right ) says the silver made her more determined to take gold at the @entity73 , which she did @entity21 also criticised @entity108 's choice to sponsor two - time drugs cheat @entity110 ‘ hopefully things are being done about it and it wo n’t keep progressing on to years down the line , ’ she added			1
@entity21 also criticised @entity108 ’s decision to award two - time drugs cheat @entity110 a new sponsorship deal			0
‘ again , frustrating more than anything , ’ she said			0
‘ you see people cheating and they are rewarded for it down the line			0
i just do n’t think it ’s fair			0
at the same time you do n’t want to get too wrapped up in it because i ca n’t control what sponsors do with athletes			0
but it ’s hard to read stories like that			0
’ @entity0 trains in the @entity134 apparel range designed with advanced fabric for maximum cooling , and the adidas @entity131 boost trainers			1

@entity0 second to @entity6 in 2011 championships
@entity6 has since been found to have failed a test in 2009
she has been banned but her 2011 @entity5 title still *remains*
