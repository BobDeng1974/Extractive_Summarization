by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 16:17 est , 22 september 2012 @entity1 will tomorrow launch a worldwide network of @entity4 embassies to rival the emergence of the @entity6 as a foreign superpower			1
the foreign secretary is in @entity9 where he will sign an agreement to open joint @entity12 - @entity9 diplomatic missions abroad			1
he also hopes @entity13 and @entity14 will join the initiative whereby the four countries will pool their resources to extend their combined influence on world affairs			1
hitting back : @entity20 hopes to secure @entity12 's place as a world power the move by @entity24 mr @entity1 is seen as a counter to the @entity6 ’s fast - expanding @entity26 , which is setting up offices in the @entity28 and other major countries			2
it is seen by some @entity12 diplomats as a direct threat to @entity12 ’s standing as a major world power			2
now mr @entity1 is hitting back with plans to increase the number of @entity12 embassies by teaming up with the three @entity4 allies			1
superpower : the foreign secretary wants to create a worldwide network in remote nations where @entity9 but not @entity12 has an embassy , or vice versa , they will share the embassy			2
similar arrangements are expected to include @entity13 and @entity14			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ as @entity48 said when addressing the @entity9 parliament last year , “ we are two nations , but under one @entity50 and united by one set of values			0
” ‘ we have stood shoulder to shoulder from the great wars of the last century to fighting terrorists in @entity58 and supporting @entity60 nations like @entity61 and @entity62			0
‘ we are first cousins			1
so it is natural that we look to link up our embassies with @entity9 ’s in places where that suits both countries			0
it will give us a bigger reach abroad for our businesses and people for less cost			0
’ one @entity12 diplomat put it more bluntly : ‘ for all the grandiose talk of @entity78 unity , we have so much more in common with many @entity4 countries than the @entity6 – and not just the @entity81 language			1
‘ there is a saying in the @entity12 diplomatic corps that “ the @entity85 want to do us over , the @entity86 want to lord it over us and the @entity88 are all over the place ”			0
‘ we would never dream of trusting them with intelligence secrets , but we share everything with the @entity9 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
‘ @entity93 can extend its diplomatic reach – well , so can we			1
the @entity6 is so burdened by history it does n’t know what it wants to do and is hopeless at speaking with one voice			0
‘ we @entity98 know who we are , who our real friends are , and between us we have been a rather good influence on the world in the past century			0

will team up with the three @entity4 allies
will look to ' first cousins ' to rival @entity93
