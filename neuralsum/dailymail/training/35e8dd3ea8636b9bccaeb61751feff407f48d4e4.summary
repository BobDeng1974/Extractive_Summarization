by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 08:53 est , 31 july 2013 a calculation by a @entity3 mathematician describes the rate that humans would become zombies a @entity3 mathematician believes only frequent coordinated attacks against the living dead can save the human race			1
a mathematical calculation by a professor at the @entity13 - ( @entity14 ) ( @entity15 ) z = @entity16 - describes the rate that humans would become zombies as they are gradually infected by the living dead			1
the maths might seem bizarre , but it can be used to model the spread of disease in the modern world			1
@entity25 is publishing his zombie maths models and others created by researchers in a forthcoming book called ' mathematical modelling of zombies , ' @entity24 reported			2
his calculations show why zombies are the viruses of the monster world			2
while dr @entity25 chose a tongue - and - cheek scenario , the maths is important as zombies ' likeness to the way viruses spread in the real world makes them interesting subjects for theoretical analyses of virus epidemics			1
in his zombie apocalypse equation - ( @entity14 ) ( @entity15 ) z = @entity16 - where @entity15 represents the total population , @entity15 is the number of people susceptible to zombie attacks , @entity47 is the number of zombies and b is the likelihood of transmission , the model shows that people would quickly become zombies			2
it also demonstrates that the living dead would efficiently take over the world as there is no possibility of ' stable equilibrium ' where zombies and humans could peacefully co-exist or overcome the zombie infection			1
the mathematicians told @entity24 that only coordinated attacks to eradicate early zombies could save humanity			1
@entity75 , like dr @entity25 's research , plays an important role in preparing for and fighting viral epidemics			0
dr @entity25 's maths is important as zombies ' likeness to the way viruses spread in the real world makes them interesting subjects for theoretical analyses of virus epidemics			1
zombies from @entity86 are pictured @entity87 , founder of the @entity88 , told @entity24 that as zombies are biological in nature and do not live forever , mathematicians can apply biological models to them			0
they are often depicted as flesh - eating monsters who spread their disease by munching on healthy people virologist @entity97 of the @entity98 at the @entity99 blogged about new film @entity100 , in which @entity102 plays a @entity104 inspector scouring @entity105 for the origin of a zombie outbreak			0
he said : ' a zombie is a bit like giving a virus legs and teeth			0
' this is basically a virus taking over a host , and spreading very quickly and efficiently ... it 's an extreme virus - transmission event , if you like			0
' virologist @entity97 talked about zombies in film @entity100 starring @entity102 ( pictured )			0
he said zombies are ' a virus taking over a host and spreading very quickly and efficiently ' dr @entity25 believes the rapidity of infection in zombie infections ( depicted in films ) makes the spread of disease unstoppable as ' it only takes one zombie to overtake a city '			2
he believes quarantine or slowing the spread of the disease down only delays the zombie apocalypse , instead of stopping it completely			0
only very frequent attacks that increase in their effectiveness could save humanity , he said			1
to come up with his mathematical model , dr @entity25 used a technique developed just two decades ago called ' impulsive differential equations ' that demonstrates how sudden shocks affect systems and is often used to model satellite orbits			0
the zombie maths models have helped develop another working model for a real disease - human papillomavirus ( @entity147 ) .			0

a @entity3 mathematician has created a calculation to show the rate that humans would become zombies
@entity155 , of the @entity13 's maths *department* , has used it to model the spread of disease in the modern world
it also demonstrates the living dead would take over the world as there is no point at which zombies and humans could peacefully co-exist
only frequent attacks that increase in effectiveness could save humanity
