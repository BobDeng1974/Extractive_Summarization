by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 2 april 2013 a survey found almost two - thirds of us hate cold callers who address customers by their first name answering the phone halfway through dinner to a cold caller trying to sell you things you ’ll never want or need is bad enough			2
what ’s worse ? when they use your first name to do it			2
almost two - thirds of us hate cold callers who address customers by their first name and start conversations with ‘ hi ’ , a study found			2
it concluded that the growing trend towards informality irritated the majority of people , who would rather be addressed properly by strangers			1
more than half would prefer to be addressed as @entity30 , mrs or @entity32 rather than by their first names , the survey found			2
nearly a third of the 1,000 polled said it annoyed them when someone they did n’t know called them by their first name			0
the figure was slightly higher among the over- 60s			0
three in ten said they were fed up with strangers , from cold callers to coffee shop workers , treating them like friends			1
that included having their first name written on their takeaway coffee cup , a policy imported to @entity49 from the @entity50 by @entity51			0
twelve per cent of those surveyed said they did not like the practice			0
almost a third said they resented receiving personalised emails from companies that were contacting them at random			0
even those who use social media - a far more informal approach to communication - do not like the faux - friendliness of the networking sites			0
nearly one in five objected to @entity69 's ' how 's it going ? ' messages on status bars where users post updates			1
people also objected to faux - friendliness on @entity69 with a fifth disliking the ' how 's it going ? ' message and around a fifth said they did not like their bank using their first name rather than their full title in telephone conversations			1
the most traditional views were held in @entity82 , where 38 per cent said they disliked the growing informality of modern @entity49			1
the most relaxed region was @entity85 , where only 21 per cent said they were concerned			1
a spokesman for @entity88 , which commissioned the survey , said : ‘ there is nothing wrong with friendliness but it just does n’t wash when it comes from someone you have never met or even spoken to			0
‘ often these are people who are trying to sell you something and who have no other interest in you yet they treat you like a long - lost pal			1
‘ britons are saying “ enough is enough ” and do not think it is old - fashioned to demand a bit of respect and to be called mr , mrs , or @entity32 by cold callers , sales staff and others			0
’ unsurprisingly , older @entity49 dislike the trend most , with 62 per cent of the over- 60s demanding to be called mr , mrs or @entity32 when addressed by strangers .			1

poll finds three in ten people fed up with strangers treating them like friends

most traditional views held in @entity82 , while @entity85 are more relaxed
