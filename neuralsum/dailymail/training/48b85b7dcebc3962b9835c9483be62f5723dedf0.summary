@entity0 feels criticism of @entity2 this season is totally unjustified			1
the @entity6 captain 's perceived waning influence has been highlighted as a factor in @entity9 's shaky start to the campaign			2
but @entity12 ' side were much more dynamic in saturday 's @entity14 derby and @entity2 's free - kick in the 65th minute appeared to have sealed victory until @entity17 struck a stunning late equaliser to earn a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity2 scored a superb free kick on saturday to put @entity9 1 - 0 ahead against @entity21 the @entity9 captain has scored nine times against @entity21 , the most of any player in @entity14 derbies @entity2 has now scored nine goals in @entity27 @entity14 derbies , more than any other player			1
@entity0 said of his 34 - year - old midfield partner : ' @entity30 's still one of the best players in the @entity27			1
' there 's no doubting his quality			0
a lot of teams have been putting someone to man - mark him , which shows just how good he is			2
' i do n't think he deserves any criticism			1
he 's been the best player this league 's probably seen in a long time and still is			0
' @entity2 answered his critics with an excellent performance against @entity21 after a slow start to the season @entity0 says his captain is still a top player who does n't deserve his criticism @entity9 had 24 shots compared to @entity21 's 11 and @entity49 , who got a hand to @entity2 's free - kick but could not keep it out , was certainly the busier goalkeeper			1
@entity12 ' team have struggled to recapture the form that almost brought them the league title last season , but the consolation from saturday 's result was certainly an improved display			0
@entity0 said : ' it 's disappointing			2
the performance was very good , back to the level we expect			0
' the intensity was good all over the pitch , we worked hard , we were more fluent going forward and we made chances as well			0
and also we defended really well throughout the game so that was pleasing			0
@entity17 's wonder - strike was enough to earn @entity21 a point at @entity72 late in the game @entity0 said he was disappointed with the result after conceding late but the performance was better ' we did quite a lot of work during the week on defending and i think we showed just how well we can defend , so that needs to be the case from now on			1
' then with the goal , there 's not much you can do about that , it 's a great strike			0
' @entity12 had hoped for a similar spark to last season , when a 4 - 0 victory over @entity21 at @entity72 began a run of 37 points from a possible 39			1
instead , their bubble was well and truly burst by @entity17 's wonder strike and it was the @entity21 fans left singing in the stands at the end			2
@entity2 , @entity0 and @entity98 stand over a free kick as @entity9 put pressure on their neighbours but @entity0 is confident there will be no hangover with a busy fixture list ahead , starting with a @entity106 trip to @entity107 on wednesday			1
' i do n't think it 'll affect us because the performance level was very good , ' said the @entity113 man			2
' we 've got to take the positives out of that			0
the goal was in the top corner so we 've just got to keep going and keep playing like that			0
if we keep putting in performances like that we 'll win more than we do n't			0

@entity2 scored brilliant free kick in 1 - 1 draw against @entity21
former @entity113 captain has been criticised for early season displays
' i do n't think he deserves any criticism ' says @entity0
