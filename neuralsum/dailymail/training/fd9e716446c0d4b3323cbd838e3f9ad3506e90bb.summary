by @entity0 published : 03:47 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 12:38 est , 2 november 2012 an increasingly confident @entity1 has returned to his rhetoric of 2008 , presenting himself as a challenger to the status quo who will change politics and railing against ‘ lobbyists and special interests ’ in @entity10			1
speaking before 10,000 people in the @entity13 heartland of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity1 , his voice hoarse , delivered a fiery 36 - minute speech designed to whip up his base of voters and rekindle some of the magic of four years ago ahead of tuesday 's election			1
he is very much in contention too in @entity33 and @entity34 , which his opponent @entity32 must win			0
but @entity1 is campaigning in @entity43 , @entity15 and @entity44 , states he won easily in 2008 and which hoped would have been in the bag by now			1
if @entity31 , @entity34 and @entity33 fall , his aides calculate , these states might save him			1
‘ back in 2008 , when we talked about change , i told you i was n’t just talking about changing presidents			2
i was n’t just talking about changing parties , ’ @entity1 said in @entity14			1
‘ i was talking about changing our politics			0
‘ i ran because the voices of the @entity57 people - your voices - had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by lobbyists and special interests , and politicians who believe that compromise is a dirty word and who would say anything to win office , and do anything to stay in office			0
’ change , again : @entity1 brought up memories of the previous election campaign plans : @entity1 said ' the future does n't have many lobbyists ' despite having included many former lobbyists in his administration , @entity1 said : ‘ the future does n’t have lobbyists			1
they ’ll never have as many lobbyists as the vested interests			0
never have as many lobbyists as the past does			0
’ lobbyists , however , have been frequent and repeated visitors to the @entity1 @entity85			1
according to the @entity89 , @entity86 , who lists @entity87 as a client has been to the @entity85 more than 30 times under @entity1			1
@entity91 , lobbyist for the @entity92 , has been by more than 50 times			0
@entity94 , a lobbyist for the @entity96 corporation , has been 25 times			0
@entity99 , a lobbyists for the @entity101 , has been more than a dozen times			0
but the populist rhetoric was lapped up by the crowd as @entity1 promised 100,000 new ‘ math and science teachers ’ and training for two million workers			2
aiming high : @entity1 pledged training for two million workers and more teachers not the status quo : @entity32 said he was the real agent of change @entity1 sought to seize back the mantle of change from @entity32 , who has recently claimed he is the real candidate of change and @entity1 represents the status quo in @entity10			2
‘ i know what real change looks like , because i fought for it , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ i 've got the scars to prove it			0
and after all that we 've been through together , @entity15 , we sure as heck ca n't give up now			2
’ the argument is unlikely to persuade many swing voters , who have become jaded after four years of high unemployment , soaring debt and partisan gridlock in @entity10			0
but it is a message that resonates among diehard @entity13 , who @entity1 desperately needs to go to the polls			1
@entity1 also looked back to the @entity131 years , blaming his predecessor for the mess that he had spent ‘ four years cleaning up ’ and harking back to president @entity135 ’s time in the @entity85 from 1993 to 2001			1
‘ we know the ideas that worked , ’ @entity1 said in @entity136 , @entity43			2
‘ we also know the ideas that do n't work			0
because in the eight years after @entity135 left office , his policies were reversed			0
’ @entity1 speaking in @entity14 , @entity15			1

president told 10,000 in @entity15 that the future does not hold many lobbyists
@entity1 has edged ahead in the polls by 0.1 per cent and seems to have an advantage in @entity31
