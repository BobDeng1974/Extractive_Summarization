five residents aged between 83 and 100 died at the home between july 22 and august 6 , 2009 , after being left malnourished , immobile in bed , and with putrid pressure sores			1
the future of the womens ' careers now lie in the hands of the @entity26 panel who ruled they are guilty of misconduct and their current fitness to practise is impaired			2
@entity26 panel chairman @entity51 said : ‘ the panel is of the view that the residents of the home were elderly people , suffering from both mental and physical disabilities and in most cases were also assessed as lacking mental capacity to make decisions regarding their care			2
‘ those people were unable to care for themselves , extremely vulnerable and completely reliant on the registered nurses at the home , ’ he said			0
‘ a number of residents were found to be suffering from severe grade four pressure sores which had not been correctly treated and which in some cases were so deep that tendons and / or bones were exposed			0
‘ they were malnourished , some were dehydrated and lived in a care home that was described as run - down , filthy , and stocked with faulty or inappropriate equipment , ’ he said			0
nurses @entity19 and @entity18 were among those found guilty of leaving malnourished patients to endure pressure sores so severe their bones were exposed the panel has heard that in some cases residents had been fed on a diet consisting of little more than porridge			1
mr @entity51 said the ‘ appalling condition ’ of the pensioners was ‘ a direct result of a complete failure of the nursing staff at the home ’			0
‘ the panel heard evidence that the pressure sores suffered by the residents were either preventable or should not have progressed to the extreme state had they been provided with adequate care or nourishment , ’ he added			0
concerns about @entity12 were first raised when an elderly woman was admitted to @entity99 on july 21 , 2009 with severe pressure sores on her heels exposing her bones and tendons			2
she was unresponsive and died the following day , exhibiting signs of dehydration and malnourishment			0
@entity12 in @entity13 where the nurses found guilty of misconduct left patients with bed sores so severe their bones were exposed another resident with severe pressure sores died on the same day at the home , while three people were shipped out of the home over fears for their health			1
the third vulnerable pensioner died in a community hospital on july 28 while two died in separate care homes on august 4 and 6			0
