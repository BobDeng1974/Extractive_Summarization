the father of one of the three alleged @entity4 spies in @entity5 was a high ranking @entity6 intelligence service officer , it emerged today			1
@entity7 , 40 , is one of two ' espionage ring ' members who left @entity5 under diplomatic cover			1
he was a handler of @entity11 , 39 , who is now detained in @entity12 on suspicion of being part of an intelligence gathering that sought to recruit spies - including female college students - in the @entity5 , according to federal prosecutors			1
meanwhile it has been revealed the third alleged spy , @entity19 , who has also left @entity5 , was recorded complaining his role was a far cry from the @entity23 lifestyle he had imagined			1
his two co-accused left @entity5 under diplomatic cover but @entity11 was not a diplomat the men , including @entity33 , allegedly conspired to gather economic intelligence on behalf of @entity4 , including alleged information about @entity5 sanctions against the country , and to recruit @entity12 residents as intelligence sources , @entity5 attorney general @entity30 ( pictured in a file photo ) said in a statement the three were all charged on monday with conspiring to gather economic intelligence on behalf of @entity4 , including alleged information about @entity5 sanctions against the country , @entity5 attorney general @entity30 said in a statement			1
@entity7 was bugged by the @entity45 and overheard saying that to recruit women ' you either need to f * * * them or use other levers to influence them '			1
in @entity50 today it emerged that @entity7 's father @entity51 , killed in a car crash in 2008 , held the rank of major - general in the @entity6 secret service , once headed by @entity56			2
@entity57 , who died aged 57 , worked in the border guard section of the vast @entity6 ( @entity6 ) structure			0
it is not uncommon for @entity4 espionage services to recruit the children of trusted officers			2
@entity33 junior and @entity19 , 27 , have gone to ground since the allegations were revealed on monday			1
@entity11 , 39 , masked this work by posing as a banker for @entity4 's @entity69 , ( pictured ) according to the complaint and the bank 's website @entity19 was also caught on tape by the @entity45 , complaining about the wide gulf between @entity76 's glamorous version of being a spy , and the reality			1
' the fact that i 'm sitting with a cookie right now at the â€¦ chief enemy spot			0
@entity85 * * * ! , ' he allegedly said in @entity4 , the @entity83 reported			2
' not one point of what i thought then , ( unintelligible ) not even close			0
( @entity89 ) movies about @entity23			0
' of course i would n't fly helicopters , but pretend to be someone else at a minimum			0
' both left the @entity5 before charges were filed , it is reported			2
@entity4 broke its silence over the charges on tuesday afternoon , when the foreign ministry dismissed the claims , saying the @entity5 had failed to provide any evidence			1
in a statement demanding @entity11 's release , spokesman @entity102 said : ' one gets the impression that the @entity5 government has decided to use a favored practice of unleashing passions over espionage			1
' he added : ' @entity4 - @entity5 ties are going through an extremely complicated period due to @entity112 's hostilities			1
' relations between the two countries are at their worst for some time , with @entity112 imposing several rounds of sanctions on @entity4 for annexing the @entity118 peninsula from @entity119 in 2014 and backing @entity121 rebels in eastern @entity119 , targeting @entity4 financial and energy companies			0
the @entity45 @entity125 account carried the news on its page on monday afternoon , announcing they had arrested @entity11			2
the other two men had already left the country state - run news agency @entity131 expressed surprise that evidence against the trio included a phone call by @entity33 to @entity11 - who is claimed to have worked as a banker to cover his intelligence role - asking for help formulating questions to be asked by an unnamed @entity4 news agency			1
embarrassingly for @entity50 , @entity7 was evidently caught in a bugged phone call talking to his fellow spy on the use of college women as potential spy recruits			2
' i have lots of ideas about such girls , ' @entity7 is alleged to have told @entity19			2
' but these ideas are not actionable because they do n't allow you to get close enough			0
and in order to be close you either need to f * * * them or use other levers to influence them			0
' so when you tell me about girls , in my experience , it 's very rare that something workable will come of it			0
' @entity11 , who is understood to have worked in @entity4 @entity69 's @entity162 office , was placed under arrest on monday			1
married , he resided in @entity12 but is believed to have come from @entity50			0
@entity166 analysts have speculated his focus high - speed @entity166 trading , automated trading algorithms , and ' destabilisation of markets ' may have meant he was learning how to trigger a @entity166 meltdown , the @entity164 reported			1
@entity7 was officially a @entity4 trade representative			1

@entity7 and @entity19 were also charged but will not face justice because unlike @entity11 they were covered by diplomatic immunity			1
the spy ring is not the first of its kind			0
in june 2010 , @entity175 was one of ten @entity4 arrested in @entity12 and @entity177 after they were identified as being @entity6 ' sleeper ' agents			0
