@entity9 's boyfriend @entity8 loves her sandwiches so much he promised he 'd propose marriage to her once she had made him 300			1
and with only 124 wraps , pittas , burgers and baguettes to go , she 's getting pretty close			0
and @entity8 , who has been dating @entity9 for two years , ca n't go back on his word : the savvy @entity18 - based writer has been chronicling her efforts in a colourful gastronomic blog , 300sandwiches , in which she provides daily recipes , witty anecdotes and tempting photographs of her creations			1
@entity9 's blog 300sandwiches.com chronicles her bread - buttering tactic to get what she wants - marriage - by making her boyfriend @entity8 sarnies now , more than halfway through her bread - based challenge , @entity9 has just revealed her previously secret identity , and disclosed that her time spent not making sarnies is actually spent as a reporter on the @entity35			1
despite a telling - off by gossip website @entity37 , who say @entity9 is ' deranged ' and must have ' lost her goddamn mind ' to be bowing to the stringent demands of her bossy boyfriend - he wo n't eat sliced avocado , broccoli , spinach , mushrooms , anything with the word ' sprouts ' in it , cauliflower , raw tomatoes , peas , kale , blueberries , raisins or olives - @entity9 continues to defend her behaviour			1
sandwich number 19 , made on 18 august 18 , was a prime rib steak ciabatta with caramelised onions and rocket she says : ' some might say the idea is sexist			2
i say come over for dinner , and watch @entity65 whip up roasted duck breast with a balsamic and currant sauce with a roasted parsnip puree and shaved pickled beets in no time , and you 'll see who spends more time in the kitchen			0
sandwich number 175 was fried green tomatoes with feta and pesto ' some say i ’m just desperate to get engaged			0
i do n't have to be			0
@entity65 did n't say " cook me 300 sandwiches or i ’m leaving you " , he gave me a challenge - a dare , to some degree - and the type - a , @entity80 side of me ca n't stand being challenged			1
' when i reach my 300th sandwich , i ’ll have an arsenal of meals i can use for dinner , parties , picnics , breakfast and desserts			0
' and barring any major fights or infidelities , @entity65 and i will likely go all the way , buy that country house and have babies , so i 'll need to know how to cook a variety of meals for my kids and house guests anyway			0
' writing in the @entity35 , @entity9 explained the reasons behind the challenge that has led to her spending the past few months whipping up lobster rolls , @entity106 bánh mìs , pulled pork buns , smoked salmon and scrambled egg bagels , grilled cheese toasties , fried courgette and tomato on a pretzel roll , @entity115 toast with banana and strawberry jam and roast chicken with sweet potato mash clubs , all for her hungry beau			1
she said : ' @entity8 is the gourmet cook in our relationship , but he 'd always want me to make him a sandwich			1
' to him , sandwiches are like kisses or hugs			2
" sandwiches are love , " he says			0
" especially when you make them			0
you ca n't get a sandwich with love from the deli			0
" on her blog , @entity9 elaborates : ' i realised what it would take to get him to commit after the first time i made him a turkey on whole wheat bread , with mustard , lettuce and @entity150 cheese			1
' " honey , this is the best sandwich ever ! " he exclaimed in between bites so rapid in succession , the sandwich was gone in minutes			0
and then , he dropped a bomb me : " you ’re , like , 300 sandwiches away from an engagement ring			2
" ' that was it - a proposal hinged on me making him sandwiches			2
' @entity9 provides recipes for each of her creations on her blog , as well as little anecdotes as to where the inspiration behind each sarnie came from and so , each week , from monday to friday , @entity9 makes @entity8 a sandwich			1
she has even been known to make one for his breakfast , one for his lunch and one for his dinner			0
in order to speed things along			0
some people were dubious about the scheme , particularly some of her single friends who believed the idea of slaving over a cold butter knife for the sake of a ring was deliriously old - fashioned and anti-feminist			2
one pal called her a ' stepford wife ' , another said : ' it 's not 1950 ! it 's chauvinistic ! he 's saying , " @entity189 for me , woman , and maybe i 'll make you my wife			1
" ' some of the sandwiches made were savoury , but others - such as this ' throat - soothing ' ice cream sandwich with @entity197 - were for times when a sweet sarnie was required the problem @entity9 's own mother had with the idea was that her daughter can not cook			1
defending her light - hearted blog , @entity9 says : ' @entity205 tracks the journey between two people in love as they share experiences and emotions through food			1
' the blog chronicles our adventures , arguments , holidays , special times and average days over the course of 300 sandwiches			2
' i will learn how to cook amazing food , we will learn more about each other , and hopefully my boyfriend will make good on his promise			0
