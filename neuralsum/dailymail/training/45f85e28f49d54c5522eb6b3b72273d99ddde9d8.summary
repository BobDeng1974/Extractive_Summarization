a @entity1 sperm donor has been forced to pay child support for a child he helped a lesbian couple conceive in 2009			1
a @entity7 judge ruled wednesday that @entity8 , the biological father of a child born to @entity10 , must repay some $ 6,000 in public assistance the state has provided the child as well as future support payments			1
@entity10 and her partner @entity15 found @entity8 on @entity16 and performed the insemination at home			1
because there was no physician present , the judge ruled @entity8 did n't meet the legal criteria of a sperm donor , so @entity8 is the father in the eyes of the state			1
‘ quite simply , the parties failed to perform to statutory requirement of the @entity39 in not enlisting a licensed physician at some point in the artificial insemination process , ' wrote @entity7 district court judge @entity43 in her decision			2
' the parties ’ self - designation of ( @entity8 ) as a sperm donor is insufficient to relieve ( @entity8 ) of parental right and responsibilities to the child , ’ @entity43 continued			0
the @entity51 filed the case in october 2012 seeking to have @entity8 declared the father of a child born to @entity10			1
never seen her before : @entity8 argued he 'd waived his rights as a parent before the 2009 conception and that he barely knew the woman with whom he fathered the child technicalities : @entity7 district judge @entity43 disagreed with @entity8			2
she ruled that the agreement failed to include a licensed physician and therefore did not live up to the state 's legal definition of sperm donation the state was seeking to have @entity8 declared the child ’s father so he can be held responsible for about $ 6,000 in public assistance the state provided , as well as future child support			1
@entity8 opposed that action , saying he had contacted @entity10 and her partner at the time , @entity15 , in response to an ad they placed on @entity16 seeking a sperm donor			1
he said he signed a contract waiving his parental rights and responsibilities			1
attorneys for the state contended the contract was moot because the parties did n’t follow a 1994 @entity1 law requiring a licensed physician to perform the artificial insemination when donors were involved			1
during oral arguments at a hearing in october , @entity89 , co-lead counsel for the state , said the case focused on child support			2
@entity8 ’s attorney , @entity95 , cited several court rulings he said support the argument that @entity8 is legally a sperm donor and not required to pay child support			1
@entity95 also argued that the @entity1 statute does n’t specifically require the artificial insemination to be carried out by a physician			2
court documents show @entity10 indicated she did n’t know the name of the donor or ‘ have any information ’ about him in her application for child support			0
however , a sperm donor contract between @entity8 and the couple includes his name , and the agency noted the couple talked about their appreciation for him in an interview with the @entity114			0
soluble bonds : @entity15 and @entity10 performed the procedure alone in their own home in 2009			0
they have since separated a filing wednesday by the @entity121 argues the sperm donor contract overlooks ‘ the well - established law in this state that a person can not contract away his or her obligations to support their child			2
’ the right for support belongs to the child , not the parents , the filing says			0
the agency said it also received different versions of the donor contract from @entity8 and @entity10 , suggesting that the document ‘ may be invalid on its face			0
’ ‘ we stand by that contract , ’ @entity95 said			0
‘ the insinuation is offensive , and we are responding vigorously to that			0
we stand by our story			0
there was no personal relationship whatsoever between my client and the mother , or the partner of the mother , or the child			0
anything the state insinuates is vilifying my client , and i will address it			0

@entity8 donated his sperm to @entity10 and her partner @entity15 in 2009 and signed a contract waiving parental rights
the @entity161 state sued @entity8 in october 2012 to receive $ 6,000 in public assistance the child had been provided
a judge ruled wednesday that @entity1 law requires a physician be present during artificial insemination and declared @entity8 the child 's legal father
the ruling will force @entity8 to pay future child support and he plans to appeal
