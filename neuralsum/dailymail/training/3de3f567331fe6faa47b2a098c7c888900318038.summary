the mayor of @entity1 has demanded that hundreds of migrants in a squalid camp are moved to a comfortable new tented area			1
@entity5 has previously warned that migrants in the town are ‘ prepared to die ’ to reach @entity8 and its generous benefits			0
but there are fears the new campsite – close to the port where many try and board lorries heading for @entity15 – will cause more problems for drivers and @entity8 border staff			1
madame @entity5 called for a camp known as @entity20 to be closed so inhabitants can be moved to more comfortable and hygienic conditions			2
at least 900 migrants live at the rubbish - infested site , trying to reach the @entity8			2
it is feared the new site , which will be close to the @entity28 camp , which opened last month , will encourage even more people into the area last night a senior @entity8 politician said the move was an example of @entity35 authorities ’ ‘ failure ’ to deal with the problem – and accused them of offering only a ‘ sticking plaster ’ solution			1
the tented site will have washing facilities and be close to the @entity28 camp , dubbed ‘ @entity43 ’ , which opened last month			2
that 12 - acre centre has beds , showers , toilets , a laundry service and medical facilities for about 2,500 migrants			0
the new ‘ @entity5 ’ camp will see ‘ guests ’ eat meals prepared by a @entity54 chef at @entity28			0
@entity57 ’s immigration spokesman @entity56 mp , who last year spoke of seeing ‘ tents on roundabouts ’ and ‘ bedspreads in bus shelters ’ in @entity1 , said migrants should be stopped from entering @entity35			1
he added : ‘ it is important the @entity35 authorities take action to identify who it is who comes to @entity1 and then determine whether or not they have a legitimate claim for asylum or refugee status or whether they are illegal immigrants … this problem wo n’t go away till @entity35 takes this responsibility seriously and whatever they are doing in providing accommodation is a sticking plaster for a clear @entity35 failure			1
’ the mayor ’s plan will see @entity8 - bound migrants moved to the new camp on council - owned land			1
from next month women and children will be given priority for overnight accommodation at @entity28 while men will sleep in tents at the adjacent site			0
lorry drivers crossing into @entity8 already have to check their vehicles for stow - aways , a desperate migrants try to enter the country illegally the decision to shut @entity20 comes after violent disturbances in august when large numbers began arriving from @entity99 and @entity100			1
six months ago a judge approved the removal of hundreds of migrants from the camp , which is on privately owned land			0
but police failed to close it or move its inhabitants			0
huge piles of rat - infested rubbish have since accumulated and migrants hacked down trees for fuel			0
they also broke into a gymnasium where dozens of families now live			0
announcing the plans earlier this week , madam @entity5 said : ‘ the aim is to evacuate the company ’s land and to protect the migrants			0
’ but the move is likely to cause more problems for lorry drivers who have to check their vehicles for migrants trying to get to @entity8			1
the mayor ’s solution will also anger @entity8 border staff trying to stem the tide of migrants arriving via @entity1			1
@entity1 residents fear a new camp will encourage a further 1,400 people sleeping rough to head for the site and make a huge ‘ tent city ’ within weeks			2
it is unclear how much the new camp will cost but @entity28 is expected to cost £ 6million a year to run – with half of that bill paid from an @entity142 grant partly funded by @entity8 taxpayers .			0
