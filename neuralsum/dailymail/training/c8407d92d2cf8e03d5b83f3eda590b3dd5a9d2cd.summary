skipping breakfast in childhood may raise the risk of diabetes in later life , scientists claim			1
@entity7 research suggests youngsters who do not eat the morning meal every day may be increasing their chances of developing the ‘ type 2 ’ form of the disease as they get older			2
a study by scientists at @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity22 ’s @entity21 universities found children who missed breakfast were more likely to be insulin - resistant – a key factor in the disease			1
scientists found that children who skip breakfast could increase their chance of developing type 2 diabetes they tracked more than 4,000 @entity7 primary school pupils aged nine and ten , monitoring how often they had breakfast and what they ate			1
children who did not have the morning meal were significantly more likely to have blood markers associated with diabetes risk than those who always ate breakfast			2
they had higher insulin levels after not eating and their bodies were less able to respond to the hormone , which normally regulates the amount of sugar in the bloodstream			2
those skipping food first thing in the morning had very slightly higher blood sugar levels than children who regularly ate breakfast			1
the study , published last night in the journal @entity48 , concluded : ‘ the observed associations suggest that regular breakfast consumption , particularly involving consumption of a high - fibre cereal , could protect against the early development of type 2 diabetes risk			1
’ lead researcher dr @entity55 , of @entity56 , said the study had not directly established why skipping the meal raises the risk of diabetes			2
but she said it may be because those who do not have a healthy breakfast are more likely to snack on fatty foods later			0
eating cereal also provides a source of fibre , which has been shown to protect against the disease , she added			0
almost three million people in the @entity7 are believed to have type 2 diabetes , which is linked to lifestyle and obesity			1
the disease occurs when the body stops responding to insulin or produces too little of the hormone			0
children had higher insulin levels after not eating and their bodies were less able to respond to the hormone , which normally regulates the amount of sugar in the bloodstream ( pictured a model tests blood sugar levels ) this results in sugar building up in the bloodstream instead of being used as fuel , leading to symptoms such as extreme tiredness and thirst			1
diabetes can also cause blindness and kidney failure , and increase a person ’s chance of heart disease and stroke			0
dr @entity55 said : ‘ there is evidence that if you skip breakfast you are more likely to be overweight			0
‘ this could be explained by your eating patterns for the rest of the day			0
if you have not eaten breakfast you are more likely to snack – and those snacks are more likely to be energy - heavy			0
’ she added : ‘ eating breakfast every day could reduce the snacking behaviour for the rest of the day			0
’ diabetes @entity7 , which funded the study , said more research is needed into the link between the disease and eating breakfast			2
dr @entity120 , director of research at the charity , said : ‘ we already know that giving your child a healthy breakfast , as part of a balanced diet , can have a range of benefits for health and wellbeing			0
‘ more research will be needed to help us understand the exact link between eating breakfast and the development of type 2 diabetes , including studies that follow children through to adulthood to see how many young people with these warning signs go on to develop the condition			1
