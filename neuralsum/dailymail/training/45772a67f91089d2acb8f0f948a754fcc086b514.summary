in what looks like a cross between the fictional @entity3 and a @entity4 , this robotic beast could one day be juggling cars at an event near you			0
former @entity9 engineer @entity8 has designed a 70ft ( 21 metres ) tall robotic man capable of hurling heavy objects , namely the @entity12 , at car rallies			2
dubbed @entity14 , @entity8 envisions a remote - controlled , towering droid that uses hydraulic cylinders to launch the vehicles into the air			2
dubbed @entity14 , @entity8 envisions a towering droid that uses hydraulic cylinders to hurl cars into the air at car rallies @entity14 was developed by former @entity9 engineer @entity8			1
it is a 70ft ( 21 metres ) tall robot that uses hydraulic cylinders to hurl cars			1
the giant droid will use a diesel engine to generate hydraulic pressure			1
an operator located in the robot ’s head will be able to control its motions using a haptic feedback connected to high - speed servo valves			1
it will be powered by hydraulic accumulators , or fluid storage batteries			2
@entity43 is looking for $ 2.3million ( £ 1.35 million ) to fund the project			1
‘ @entity14 represents a new frontier in robotic entertainment , ’ explained @entity45			0
‘ moving beyond the car crushing robots of the past century , @entity14 will use 21st century technology to perform breathtaking feats , including juggling up to three cars simultaneously			0
’ according to @entity56 ’s designs , an operator located in the robot ’s head will be able to control its motions using haptic feedback , connected to high - speed servo valves			1
it will be powered by hydraulic accumulators - storage batteries for hydraulic fluid - which will allow for the smooth movement needed for the @entity14 to throw cars or other large , heavy objects			1
@entity14 would also operate within a ‘ safety radius ’ , in case a car is dropped			0
an operator located in the robot 's head will be able to control its motions using haptic feedback			2
it will be powered by hydraulic accumulators - storage batteries for hydraulic fluid - which will allow for the smooth movement needed for the @entity14 to throw cars ( illustration pictured ) or other large , heavy objects @entity14 looks similar to the @entity3 ( pictured ) in the 1999 film of the same name			1
it was based on the 1968 story , @entity80 , by former @entity82 poet laureate @entity81 @entity8 and his team are currently seeking investment for his project , estimated to cost $ 2.3 million ( £ 1.3 million ) the first stage of the @entity14 project will be construction of a working 8ft ( 2.4 metre ) tall single arm			2
proof - of - principle juggler , able to toss and catch a 250lb ( 113kg ) mass. the finished version will need to be capable of holding , and throwing , a typical @entity12 weighing 2,700lb ( 1,220kg )			0
@entity8 was a technician at @entity9 ’s @entity93 and built mechanisms for experiments on space shuttle flights during the 1980s			0
he is a hydraulics expert and previously built a diesel and hydraulic vehicle used to move six tonne , 40ft ( 12 metre ) sections of pipe up a tunnel in @entity102			0
he also designed , built and operated the equipment for the in - flight fight scene in the @entity106 movie @entity107			0
@entity8 and his team are currently seeking investment for his project , estimated to cost $ 2.3 million ( £ 1.3 million )			0

the 70ft ( 21 metre ) @entity14 was *created* by a former @entity9 engineer
the design features a 70ft ( 21 metres ) tall robot that uses hydraulic cylinders to hurl and catch cars
