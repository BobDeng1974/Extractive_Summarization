@entity8 feared for the life of an owl after she found a perfect imprint of it on one of her windows ms @entity8 , of @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ' i was scared i would go outside to find an owl lying on the ground - it looked like it hit the window really hard			1
' luckily , when i went out to take a look , there was nothing there , so we 're hoping it survived			0
' @entity35 , who works for the @entity36 , said the print was probably caused by the waterproofing residue found on owl feathers			1
he said : ' @entity40 have a natural residue which occasionally leaves this kind of mark on windows			0
' if there was no owl lying around outside it probably picked itself up and flew off - most likely a bit dazed			2
' @entity8 initially feared for the life of the owl ( not pictured ) when she found the beautiful impression he added : ' we do get sent pictures like this from time to time , but rarely with such detail			1
' hanging tinsel might help prevent this sort of thing			0
if it happens a lot we recommend putting stickers of bird silhouettes on the window			0
