@entity0 has revealed he turned down the chance to succeed @entity2 as @entity4 manager in the summer because the @entity6 club failed to make him feel wanted enough			1
the former @entity8 midfielder was left disappointed by a take it or leave it contract offer packed full of unappealing clauses that ' failed to rock my boat ’			1
the inflexible and cut - price nature of the negotiations over the manager ’s job with the @entity18 champions reminded @entity0 of the club playing on his affections when negotiating his deal to sign as a player in 2005			1
@entity0 played for @entity4 between 2005 and 2006 but turned down the chance to manage the club @entity0 , pictured here in his testimonial match in 2006 , said @entity4 did n't make him feel wanted this summer an unimpressed @entity0 was left thinking : ‘ they were playing the part — ' it ’s @entity4 ' — you should almost go up there for nothing			1
‘ @entity4 wanted me but they were n’t showing how much they wanted me			1
’ and a non-negotiable decision to appoint his right - hand - man — thought to be under - pressure current boss @entity34 — also left the fiery @entity35 feeling @entity4 had doubts over his ability , even though he had been offered the job by majority shareholder @entity39			1
speaking in his new autobiography @entity42 , the 43 - year - old recalled the moment @entity4 made their move in late may			1
‘ i got a call : would i go and have a chat with @entity39 ? i ’d met him once before , in 2005 , when i was signing to play for @entity4			1
‘ i met him for a cup of tea			2
it was in the middle of an international week , in @entity51			0
@entity0 believes @entity4 thought the club 's reputation on its own would be enough to lure him back to @entity6 ‘ at the end of the chat , he said : ' the job is yours '			1
‘ it was all pretty straightforward			2
there would be one or two restrictions , about staff			0
they had already picked the man who would be my assistant and they were insisting on him			0
‘ it did n’t scare me off but it did get me thinking			2
it was n’t an ideal start			0
were they doubting me already ? ‘ i came back to the team hotel and spoke to @entity69 ( @entity70 )			2
i told him i would have a think about it			0
‘ we ( the @entity74 ) had a game against @entity76 at @entity77 in @entity78 on the following saturday			2
after turning down the @entity4 manager 's job , @entity0 joined @entity81 as @entity83 's assistant manager ‘ the fact i had spoken to @entity39 had become public knowledge			1
‘ it had to , because @entity69 had a press conference and a few things had been leaked — as usual			2
it was a massive compliment			0
over the years , i had always said : “ if you ’re offered the @entity4 job , you do n’t turn it down ”			1
‘ i was in a predicament ... and my gut feeling was saying : ' you ’re on your own with this one '			0
@entity0 's book is as fiery as his first autobiography ‘ i asked @entity96 , the @entity97 ’ @entity99 lawyer , to speak to @entity4 to discuss terms			1
money had n’t been mentioned yet			0
‘ i got in touch with @entity4 ’s chief executive , @entity103 and asked him to give me a ballpark figure before negotiations got going			1
‘ he mentioned a figure and he said : ' but that ’s it '			0
@entity83 told me there were a lot of clauses in the contract that he was n’t happy with			0
and the figures were non-negotiable			0
‘ i got my head around that			0
but it felt a bit too familiar			0
i had been down this road before when i signed for @entity4 as a player			1
‘ i felt they wanted me but they were n’t showing how much they wanted me			2
‘ we played @entity76 on the saturday and i had a message on my phone on sunday from @entity39			2
‘ they wanted a heads - up by tomorrow , monday			2
‘ i thought about the @entity4 offer			1
it was n’t rocking my boat			0
‘ they were n’t convincing me : ' listen , you ’re the man for us '			0
‘ i went to @entity96 ’s house ( on sunday night )			0
there were things i was n’t happy with in the contract			0
but i know if you examined every clause too carefully , you would never sign anything			0
‘ i rang @entity39 on the monday and said : ' i ’m really honoured you offered me the job but i want to stay with @entity69 '			2
’ @entity0 would later take up an offer to coach at @entity81 under former @entity4 captain @entity83			1
but he denied that any such potential job offers were behind his decision to turn down @entity4			1
he also spoke of his dismay that @entity4 did not prove flexible enough to persuade him to change his mind when he turned down their initial unacceptable offer			1
the new book reveals how badly @entity0 fell out with former @entity8 boss sir @entity146 he said : ‘ had @entity4 shown enough in their negotiating , ' we ’ll move this , you can take that ' — a bit of give and take — i might have hesitated			1
‘ they just did n’t show me that they wanted me and i was happier staying in the @entity153 job			1
‘ working with @entity69 had given me back a love of the game and i ’m all for showing a bit of loyalty			0
‘ i had only been in the job two minutes			2
we had n’t played a competitive game yet			0
‘ i felt powerful saying : ' no '			0
but i wondered if i was making the right decision			0
‘ right job , wrong time			1
