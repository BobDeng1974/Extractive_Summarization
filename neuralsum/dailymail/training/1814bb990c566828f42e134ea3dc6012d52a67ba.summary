peacock spiders are so *small* you could fit ten of them on a *fingernail*
the abdomen of the male peacock spiders is covered in colourful flaps
males dance and display these colours in an attempt to attract a mate
they display these colours to females of their own , and other , species
they *'re* found in @entity3 and this species only lives in @entity35
