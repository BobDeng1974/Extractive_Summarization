with its pristine slopes , spectacular views and seemingly endless supply of glühwein , it 's no surprise that @entity5 has been pulling in the tourists for more than 150 years			1
but what do you do if skiing is n't your thing ? not everyone likes wobbling through the snow at a 90 degree angle and coming to a chilly stop in a snowdrift			1
that , however , does n't mean there is n't anything for non-skiers to do in the @entity20 mountain town			1
as i discovered over a sisters - only weekend in the mountains , there 's plenty of choice - provided you do n't mind getting cold			1
celebrations : @entity5 is celebrating its 150th year as a winter sports destination this year one of the loveliest parts of a holiday in @entity5 is the journey there on the @entity33 ; a beauteous trip that takes in soaring peaks , plunging gorges and some of the brightest blue water this side of the @entity39			1
as the town draws nearer , the peaks get snowier - this year included			1
while the lake on which @entity5 sits remains resolutely liquid , the peaks are as starkly white as ever			1
we were staying at the @entity45 , a central pile a stone 's throw from the station , although the efficient reception desk sent down a car rather than making us drag our suitcases through the snow			2
inside , it was beautifully warm and decked out in aristocratic style , with draped curtains , acres of gold gilding and luxuriously thick red carpets			2
upstairs , corridors painted a plain cream and enlivened with antique paintings spread out in every direction , including the one that led to my room - a spacious twin with a little ensuite bathroom encased in what looked like a colossal walnut cupboard			2
spectacular : the tiny town sits on the shores of @entity74 and is flanked by @entity76 peaks travel in style : arriving in @entity5 means a journey through the mountains on the @entity33 from the window , i could see the towering peaks that rear up behind the town , including the magnificent @entity86 - home to some of @entity5 ' best ski slopes			1
i headed up there the next day just to make sure that i definitely was n't in the mood to ski and found myself enchanted by the stunning views , if less so by the vast @entity92 branded cafe plonked next to the lifts			1
with us was @entity97 ski instructor @entity96 , a man of endless bons mots and inexhaustible patience , even when faced with sisters demanding a hot chocolate break at regular intervals			2
during one of these , he revealed his top tips for skiing success , among them leaning forward ( ' it stops you falling over ' ) , and the intricacies of the snowplough slowing technique			0
he also had some wisdom on the subject of choosing ski instructors to share - the older , the better being his mantra			1
' it 's because they understand why beginners are scared , ' he added			2
peering over the edge of a steep ( for me ) blue run slope , i could n't help but agree			2
perfect conditions : @entity5 ' @entity86 ski slopes have escaped the warm weather and kept their snow base : @entity126 's team stayed at the beautiful @entity45 in the centre of @entity5 one blistered shin and a tumble later , i was ready to head down the mountain and get to grips with the real purpose of the exercise - the apres ski			1
first though , i had an appointment with local chocolatier @entity136 to discover the secrets of another @entity140 tradition - chocolate			2
upstairs a classic @entity140 cafe complete with a cheerful counter and a mind - boggling array of chocolates and pastries , downstairs was a warren of tiny kitchens , each of which contained a culinary whizz painstakingly producing a series of toothsome creations			2
not all were small , however , among them a chocolate version of the @entity33 emerging for a tunnel which was due to go on display in the shop , although not for sale			0
chocolate bubbled in vats all around , carefully kept at 32 degrees - the perfect temperature for successful sweet making apparently - while piles of nuts could be seen slowly being transformed into @entity168 's traditional ( and utterly delicious ) caramel nut cake			1
interesting though the process was , the real excitement came when we got to eat some of the wares , including a gorgeous white chocolate and vodka creation and a gin version that was a little like slurping a chocolate - encased shot			2
that the most unlikely of chocolate and alcohol combinations proved tasty is no surprise in @entity5 , a town where fondue is this dish du jour and glühwein is practically served on tap			1
but you do n't always have to have the cheese variety			2
at the @entity187 's @entity186 , we tried the @entity188 which swaps bread for meat and cheese for broth			0
it was delicious - as was the red @entity195 wine served to wash it down and the @entity197 ordered by my ( very hungry ) sister			0
yet for all that , nothing tastes like @entity140 quite so much as a real cheese fondue and luckily for us , the very next day , we found the perfect place to eat it			0
having decided not to go skiing and ruled out the painful cross-country skiing alternative , we opted instead for a gentle ride through the @entity207 in a horse - drawn carriage			0
bundled up in layers of rugs , we huddled up on the cushioned seats and watched as the steep - sided valley and its diminutive stone houses slid past			0
stunning : a horsedrawn carriage through the @entity207 lets you enjoy the gorgeous surroundings in peace isolated : @entity219 , which stretches towards the @entity221 border , is home to just 700 people alternative : if you do n't fancy riding , cross-country skiing is fun for the very fit close to the village of @entity229 , the @entity207 stretches towards the @entity221 border and is flanked by craggy peaks			1
in the summer , it is a riot of alpine flowers and gently munching cows but winter brings thick snow and a total ban on cars			0
based on what we saw , they 'd only get stuck anyway			0
there is , nonetheless , a tiny village in the middle - @entity207 - which even boasts its own little hotel , the unimaginatively named @entity207			0
what was not unimaginative was the menu , which along with @entity140 classics such as schnitzel and rösti , also included one of the tastiest cheese fondues i 've ever had and a crisp local white wine to go with it			0
back in @entity5 and still not quite ready for serious exercise , we took a leisurely walk to the @entity256 which is perched on a hill overlooking the lake			1
built in 1908 , it is dedicated to @entity221 painter @entity260 who lived locally during the later years of his life and took inspiration from the craggy @entity168 region as well at @entity5 itself			1
inspiration : the @entity256 was built in 1908 and houses works by painter @entity260 stunning : the @entity168 region and @entity5 itself all feature regularly in his beautiful landscapes thrills and spills : a bobsled ride does n't come cheap but it 's guaranteed to put a smile on your face a stay at the @entity279 starts at @entity280 ( £ 344 ) per person , per night during @entity282			1
flights to @entity284 with @entity140 start at £ 130 return travelling in economy class			0
skis and snowboards travel free			0
@entity290 @entity291 , which allows you unlimited use of all public transport including trains , start at £ @entity296 for more information on @entity5 and @entity140 itself , see engadin.stmoritz.ch or @entity299 home to more than 20 paintings , the most famous is his vast life , @entity302 , death triptych which is hung in the @entity256 's upper room			1
featuring striking @entity76 scenes , plenty of @entity260 's trademark cows and farmers and a spectacular view of @entity5 , it remains one of his most popular works			1
fascinating though the @entity256 was , not everyone wants to spend a winter holiday updating their knowledge of art and so , it was finally time for something more high octane			0
at 250 @entity322 ( £ 162 ) , a trip on the @entity324 does n't come cheap but if it does n't put a smile on your face , nothing will			0
the 75 second journey sees you hurtle along an @entity76 road , through several tunnels and round a corner of eye - watering sharpness			0
it 's fascinating afterwards too			0
built in 1903 for guests from the @entity337 , the track has played host to everyone from royals to sporting stars , among them participants in not one but two @entity343			0
some of the trophies and medals can still be seen in the bobsleigh bar where , for the price of a drink or two , locals will happily regale you with stories of daring bobsledders past			0
and if you do n't fancy that , there 's always ice skating on the lake			1
with spectacular views of the surrounding slopes and the departing @entity33 , it gives skiing a serious run for its money .			0

@entity5 is celebrating the 150th *anniversary* of winter tourism this year
the town 's slopes have defied the warm weather and remain snowy
for those who do n't want to ski , there are plenty of great alternatives
*highlights* include ice - skating , bobsledding and horsedrawn carriages
