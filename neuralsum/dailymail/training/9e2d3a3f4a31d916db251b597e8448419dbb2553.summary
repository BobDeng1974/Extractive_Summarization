@entity0 knows all about the magic of @entity2 and the unrivalled buzz generated by the massive audience it reaches through being shown on @entity7 television			1
in 1998 , the @entity8 went from being a shy , gangly 17 - year - old known only among the golfing cognoscenti to the talk of @entity13 sport			0
just a month after @entity15 slalomed through the @entity17 defence to score ‘ that ’ goal at the @entity19 , @entity14 holed an unforgettable 60 - yard pitch shot on the 72nd hole of @entity2 at @entity22 to eventually finish joint fourth			0
@entity0 burst to to world - wide prominence by finishing joint fourth at @entity2 in 1998 it was a stunning performance , and @entity14 and @entity15 became linked in the minds of sports fans owing to the fact they were both rarely - gifted teenagers and everyone had been able to watch both events			1
now @entity14 fears that vital avenue with regard to exposure of golf to a new audience will be cut off if , as expected , live coverage of the game ’s most prestigious event is transferred to @entity39			1
‘ i think having golf coverage on free channels is important to the growth of the game , ’ he said			0
‘ you can see it through the massive support @entity48 receives and that ’s largely because @entity50 is still on the @entity7			2
it resonates because everyone watches it			0
’ @entity14 ’s dismay is echoed by @entity56 colleague @entity55 , who believes the decision to hand over all live coverage would have a far - reaching impact on the game			1
scotsman @entity55 fears moving @entity2 to @entity39 would have a far - reaching impact on the game the down - to - earth @entity64 is fully aware that most of the @entity13 players who became superstars , like @entity68 , @entity69 , sir @entity70 and @entity71 , came from the sort of working - class households who struggle to afford @entity39			1
‘ i think the decision is going to have a big impact on @entity13 golf in general , ’ said @entity55			1
‘ it ’s a real shame the @entity79 is making this decision as not everyone can afford satellite television and while the @entity39 coverage is great , it ’s going to be very disappointing for those who wait all year to watch @entity7 coverage of @entity2			1
’ that theme was taken up by 2012 winner @entity87 , who admitted he was amazed the @entity79 could even be thinking of giving @entity2 to @entity39			2
@entity68 kisses the @entity89 after his two - stroke victory at the @entity91 @entity93 's triumph was available for all to see on @entity7 , but that all may change with the rumoured new tv deal ‘ i am really surprised and can only conclude that @entity39 must be offering huge bucks for the @entity79 to be considering it , ’ said the big @entity95 , who lives for part of the year in the @entity13			1
‘ the @entity7 may not be so great following the golf ball with their cameras these days but think of all that tradition			2
‘ it ’s going to have a huge impact on golf in @entity13			0
everyone has got the @entity7 but not everybody is going to pay to watch @entity39			1
i have quite a few friends who still refuse to pay for @entity39			2
the great thing about the @entity7 coverage is you can just sit there all day and watch , with nothing but uninterrupted coverage			0
’ @entity14 used to do exactly that when growing up			0
however , he recognises the world has changed and believes the @entity7 has been letting the sport down in recent years			2
‘ i think the image of the game has struggled under the @entity7 and you can see that with their @entity122 awards , ’ he said			0
‘ some of the winning @entity124 @entity56 teams could and should have been honoured			0
‘ the fact also that @entity68 did n’t win the major award last year comes down to the fact so little golf is shown on the @entity7 these days and much more on @entity39			1
it clearly impacted on that decision			0
’ an announcement on the next television contract is expected within the next fortnight .			0

@entity0 burst to to world - wide prominence at the @entity135
@entity55 says *famous* *tournament* should remain on @entity7
scotsman fears moving it to @entity39 would have far - reaching impacts for golf
