with its stunning limestone cliffs towering over stilt houses surrounded by azure waters , the island of @entity1 is a typical @entity6 paradise			1
but it 's not mother nature drawing tourists here - it 's a floating football pitch			1
@entity6 's tourism industry has taken a battering this year following months of protests , the may military coup , the subsequent imposition of martial law and the murder of two young @entity17 on the holiday isle of @entity19 in september			0
youngsters play football on a floating football pitch in @entity23 , @entity6 's @entity24 province tourists leave @entity23 on long - tail boats , where the football pitch has helped the local economy the @entity29 says there has been a near nine per cent drop in tourist arrivals between january and october compared to the same period in 2013 - a painful blow for the millions of @entity34 whose livelihoods depend on the industry			1
but in @entity23 , part of @entity6 's picturesque @entity40 province , foreign visitors keep coming thanks to excitement over the community 's innovative and highly unusual football pitch			1
nestled next to the largely @entity48 island 's ferry pier , the 50 by 80 foot pitch has become something of a national treasure after an advertising campaign by a @entity6 bank in 2010 made the fishing community locally famous for their dedication to football			1
' what do you do when you come to @entity58 ? you must see the floating football pitch , ' beams island chief @entity61 , who says 50,000 - 70,000 baht ( £ 1,000 - £ 1,400 ) now comes in from tourists each day			1
the development has moved on from playing on a rickety floating mesh of wood and nails the island 's younger inhabitants are now encouraged to stay and be a part of ' the football team ' that represents a five-fold income increase for the 320 household - island since a decade ago when fishing was its mainstay , the chief says			1
the island has long had a reputation for football - obsessed inhabitants who have refused to let something as inconvenient as a complete lack of flat surfaces hold them back from practising the ' @entity84 '			1
originally islanders played on a beach , but could only do so during low tide when enough sand was visible			0
the first floating pitch was built 30 - years ago but was a dangerous hotchpotch of wooden boards knocked together with rusty nails			2
' we had to avoid nails coming up			0
it was risky and dangerous			0
but we had to play on it because we had no pitch , ' recalls boat driver @entity98 , sporting the local team 's shirt			2
@entity1 has become famous both locally - and increasingly internationally - for football inspired by their dedication , @entity102 commissioned a series of adverts charting the local team 's success in a football tournament despite the rickety pitch			1
after the campaign aired the islanders , with help from local authorities , built themselves a new - and crucially nail - free - floating pitch			1
since those adverts aired in 2011 , @entity1 has become famous both locally - and increasingly internationally - for football			1
but the pitch has done more than attract new arrivals			2
it has kept the island 's younger inhabitants from leaving			2
depopulation is often a major problem in @entity6 's poor communities , with youngsters travelling significant distances to find better paid work -- usually to support large families back home			0
in @entity1 the young are staying put			2
the island 's population has increased to 1,800 from 1,200 over the last 10 years			2
' @entity133 here are better than on the mainland - the young can find money more easily here , they can earn thousands of baht driving canoes , ' explains 74 - year - old @entity139 , a market stall holder			0
local will be hoping the tourists get involved with the floating football pitch - and then spend their money but other tourist hotspots are not so fortunate			1
between january and october tourism income in @entity6 fell 6.1 per cent compared to the same period last year to 905 million baht ( £ 17.5 billion )			0
with so many reliant on tourism in a country that dubs itself the ' @entity149 ' , @entity6 's generals know they must restore confidence			0
the junta have vowed to ' return beaches to the people ' - a side project of their wider promise to ' return happiness to @entity6 '			0
the first clean - up campaign was launched in the large resort island of @entity159 where the authorities took down unregistered umbrella and food stalls			2
but while the campaign restored a more pristine look to some of @entity159 's beaches , it angered many local businesses			0
tourism in @entity6 has been affected by murders and a military coup that has seen a nine per cent fall meanwhile the junta 's attempts to bolster tourism were dealt a blow by the september murder of @entity177 , 24 , and the rape and murder of @entity180 , 23 , on @entity19			0
the authorities have charged two @entity183 nationals with killing the @entity17 pair but they later retracted their confessions , alleging they were obtained under duress			0
@entity6 's junta leader @entity187 also caused widespread dismay after the murders when he suggested that attractive foreign women could not expect to be safe from attack if they walked around in bikinis			0
he later made a rare apology for his remarks			0
back in @entity23 the locals hope @entity6 's tourist troubles do n't put off visitors - and that the floating pitch will continue to draw curious football fans - if they are to provide for future generations			1
as village chief @entity61 concludes : ' i think we should keep the football pitch for our children and grandchildren because we can say that the floating pitch is unique to the village			1

island of @entity1 offers unusual *alternative* in the world of football
tourist flock to floating football pitch that is stimulating local economy
