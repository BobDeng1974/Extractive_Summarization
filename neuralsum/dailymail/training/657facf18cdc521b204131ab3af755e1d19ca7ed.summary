@entity1 's decision to name three reserve forwards in the @entity3 simply gave his boo boys another reason to hurl abuse			1
criticism of the @entity9 manager has reached fever pitch over the last few weeks , but nobody can fault the way he went about his business in @entity14			0
@entity9 were truly rampant , and at the heart of it was @entity17			2
that the @entity19 forward is classed as a back - up is nonsense , and that he might be heading for the exit door at @entity9 is simply ridiculous			1
he 's the best finisher @entity1 has at his disposal			1
@entity38 stepped @entity39 , @entity40 , and the aforementioned @entity17 with a chance to prove their worth at the highest level			1
and it did n't take long for the latter to strike gold			0
whether he was seeking to impress his current manager or a prospective , future boss is unclear , but @entity17 was certainly proving a point			2
@entity17 scored his first goal with his left foot , and his second ( pictured ) with his right @entity1 would be making a mistake if he sold @entity17 - he 's the best finisher @entity9 have with three minutes gone , the @entity19 rifled the ball home to put the @entity59 1 - 0 up , with the same boot that put @entity61 to the sword in october			1
the @entity19 has now scored in each of his last four @entity3 appearances			0
on 20 minutes , @entity17 struck the bar , and eight minutes later he could have had a hat - trick when @entity66 tipped his powerful shot into the side netting			2
@entity40 and @entity39 came together midway through the first half too , when the former slotted the ball through to his teammate , before the attack was thwarted			1
@entity17 slots the ball past @entity66 ( left ) to seal @entity9 's impressive night in @entity14 the @entity9 team - some regular , and some fringe - celebrate after @entity17 made it four in the dying moments , @entity17 added to his tally when he drove into the box and slotted calmly past @entity66			1
left foot , right foot			0
all he was missing was a header for the perfect night			0
@entity82 took the plaudits on an impressive evening for @entity9 , when he scored a goal that @entity85 described as ' the best i 've seen in all my years			0
' but @entity9 could n't have done it without @entity17			0
whether he has a future at the @entity89 is as yet unclear , but if @entity1 makes the decision to oust the forward , there will be a queue snaking around the @entity95 car park of managers seeking his signature			0
@entity17 is quite simply a natural - born finisher ... and they do n't come around all that often .			2

@entity1 started @entity17 , @entity40 and @entity39
there have been *rumours* that @entity17 may be heading for the exit door
he proved himself on *tuesday* with two goals and an impressive display
@entity17 is the best finisher @entity1 has at his disposal
