hosts @entity0 swept into the quarter - finals of the @entity2 in some style on tuesday with a 4 - 0 hammering of @entity5 at @entity0 that ensured @entity6 would go through from @entity7 with them			1
midfielder @entity8 and striker @entity9 struck inside three minutes just before the half - hour mark , @entity10 converted a penalty on the stroke of half time and striker @entity15 added the fourth in a one - sided second half			2
having beaten @entity19 4 - 1 to open their campaign last friday , the @entity18 have a healthy advantage in goals scored over the @entity23 and will just need a draw to win the group when the teams meet in @entity27 on saturday			0
the @entity29 team celebrate with @entity8 after he scored to put @entity0 1 - 0 up against @entity5 @entity8 ( second left ) heads past @entity31 goalkeeper @entity30 ( right ) to open the scoring in @entity33 a shot from behind the goal shows @entity8 heading home , to set @entity0 on their way on tuesday night @entity0 : @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity10 , @entity8 , @entity44 ( @entity45 51 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 77 ) , @entity48 ( @entity15 51 ) ; @entity9 subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 goals : @entity8 27 , @entity9 30 , @entity10 45 +3 , @entity15 70 @entity5 : @entity58 ; @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 said 46 ) ; @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ; @entity67 ( @entity68 88 ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 46 ) , @entity62 - @entity71 subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 more than that , though , @entity0 showed enough against a team that has caused them problems in the past to suggest their ambitions should not be confined to reaching the last eight for the third straight tournament			1
midfielder @entity44 , man of the match against the @entity92 , played only 50 minutes but contributed to the first two goals and @entity9 could have had a hat - trick on another night			0
@entity5 had the first shot on target in the third minute , @entity67 's raking half volley from outside the penalty box drawing an athletic save from @entity39 and confirming the goalkeeper 's strong form			0
that proved to be pretty much @entity5 's only attacking contribution to the match and they will now go home with @entity19 after their final group game in @entity108 on saturday			0
@entity9 ( left ) celebrates with team - mate @entity46 after doubling his country 's lead on tuesday @entity9 wheels away in celebration as the @entity5 defence watch on after conceding their second of the night the home fans go wild in celebration after @entity9 put @entity0 2 - 0 up just three minutes after their first @entity48 posted this selfie on board the @entity29 team coach after securing their place in the next round after 27 minutes , the @entity29 pressure finally told when @entity44 swung in a cross from the left which @entity125 headed down towards goal , leaving @entity8 the simplest of finishes			1
three minutes later , @entity44 was again the provider with @entity9 taking his through ball on the hip before firing it into the net through the legs of @entity30			0
@entity0 had to wait until stoppage time to go three up when @entity48 was hauled down trying to reach @entity9 's cross and @entity10 , who replaced the injured @entity137 in midfield and as penalty - taker , stepped up to convert from the spot			2
@entity141 's @entity10 scored from the spot to make it 3 - 0 to @entity0 against @entity5 @entity10 strikes the ball from the penalty spot , in @entity0 's @entity147 match against @entity5 @entity58 dives the wrong way as @entity10 fires home to put the game out of the grasp of @entity5 in @entity33 striker @entity15 , who replaced @entity48 after 50 minutes , added the fourth after 70 minutes , turning winger @entity46 's beautifully weighted cross into the net at the far post			1
@entity0 coach @entity155 might have wanted a bit more of a cutting edge inside the box as the @entity18 piled on the pressure in the second half , but will be satisfied with his team 's fourth win in his 14 matches in charge			0
the game was complete when @entity15 slid in to make it 4 - 0 to the home side at @entity0 @entity15 ( right ) with team - mate @entity46 celebrates with the television camera after scoring @entity0 's fourth @entity48 ( right ) , who was captaining his country in the absence of @entity137 , congratulates @entity15			1
