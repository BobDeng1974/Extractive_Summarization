in yet another one - sided singles match at @entity9 's @entity8 , world no 2 @entity0 took just 69 minutes to beat @entity11 runner - up @entity6 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 in @entity12 anything other than an @entity15 victory in straight sets against @entity17 later on tuesday night will guarantee @entity0 's place in the last four with a match to spare			1
despite some early pressure from @entity6 , it was @entity0 who got the first break as he stepped up and hit an inside - out forehand for 3 - 1			0
that break proved enough for @entity0 in the first set as the 17 - time @entity42 champion went on to close it out in 35 minutes			0
@entity6 , who beat @entity15 in straight sets on sunday , was no match for @entity0 in his second match @entity15 takes to the court later on tuesday in a bid to progress to the semi-finals of the tournament @entity6 continued to struggle , hitting a total of 30 unforced errors throughout the match , and @entity0 took full advantage with an early break in the third game of the second set			2
a double fault from @entity6 handed @entity0 a double break for 5 - 2 and the @entity25 served out the match with a big serve down the middle which @entity6 could not return			2
impressively it is @entity0 's 70th match win of the year and keeps alive his slim hopes of claiming the year - end world no 1 ranking ahead of @entity66 .			0
