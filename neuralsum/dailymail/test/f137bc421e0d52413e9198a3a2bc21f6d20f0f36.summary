the @entity0 used to be @entity3 football ’s biggest attraction			0
a host of world stars , two unwavering sets of supporters and a fierce rivalry meant @entity9 and @entity10 could always guarantee a spectacle			1
it was certainly the case in april 2005 when a hail of flares rained down from the stands on to the @entity17 pitch - flooding the stadium with smoke and forcing @entity20 referee @entity19 to abandon a virulent @entity22 quarter - final			1
on sunday , they meet once more against the backdrop of a @entity22 quarter - final week			1
this time , however , interest has barely stirred			0
@entity10 pose for a team photo ahead of their @entity22 quarter - final against @entity9 in 2005 @entity9 ( pictured against @entity28 in same year ) has changed dramatically since their glory years starting xis from the @entity22 quarter - final second leg , april 12 , 2005 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity42			1
starting xis from the @entity22 quarter - final second leg , april 12 , 2005 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) @entity44 ; @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54			1

@entity35 and @entity77 watch on while the match was stopped because of flares thrown on the pitch the 2005 clash – widely remembered for the chaotic scenes in which @entity83 goalkeeper @entity44 was knocked to the ground by a flare - was the second time in two seasons the sides had met in the knockout stages as the pair threatened continental dominance to add to their monopoly on @entity93 @entity95 success did follow in the form of one title apiece – @entity9 lifting the trophy in 2007 and @entity10 followed suit in 2010 – but both have seen their stock dwindle severely in the past few years			1
the pair have vacated the @entity22 scene and their form in @entity93 suggests they wo n’t be rejoining @entity107 ’s elite any time soon			1
@entity9 - @entity107 ’s most decorated club - are 15 points off the @entity22 pace in ninth			1
@entity10 are a point and place further behind			2
failure to qualify for next season – when the @entity17 plays host to the final - will see both sides absent for the second year in a row			1
never before has @entity107 ’s biggest competition gone consecutive campaigns without any representation from @entity3 ’s second city			0
for now , supporters have the derby alone to look forward to next term			0
while the rivalry remains as strong from those clashes a decade ago , the current crop of talent at both clubs does not			1
the @entity17 would morph into a @entity129 on previous derby days – with @entity131 , @entity51 and @entity132 all gracing the @entity0			0
@entity9 goalkeeper @entity44 was hit by a firework during the @entity22 quarter - final at the @entity17 @entity51 , a former world player of the year , celebrates after scoring against rivals @entity10 10 years ago the @entity9 players embrace @entity46 after his goal in the @entity22 derby match seven @entity142 winners – past and future – took to the pitch when the side ’s met in that @entity22 quarter - final second leg			1
what @entity10 ’s sporting director @entity148 would n’t give for even an ounce of that quality in today ’s side			2
‘ if players want to be worthy of this shirt , they must play better , ’ he blasted on the club ’s website after an embarrassing home draw with beleaguered @entity156 at the beginning of this month			0
‘ we are already working with @entity162 to prepare @entity10 of the future			2
this is why i say we are evaluating who is worthy of wearing this jersey and who is not			0
’ @entity162 ’s reaction to the draw was to cancel his squad ’s @entity170 break and haul them in for extra training			0
there is belief that with the former @entity177 boss back at the helm a corner can be turned			0
however , @entity180 rules , coupled with a lack of revenue from @entity95 football , means it will have to be negotiated without the full backing of @entity187 owner @entity186			2
@entity162 was in charge during the @entity10 ’s most fruitful period of recent times , winning three consecutive scudetti along with two @entity193 titles between 2004 and 2008			2
@entity10 were booed off the pitch after a disappointing draw with bottom - of - the - table @entity156 this month 2004/05 : 54,150 ( 2nd highest in @entity93 ) 05/06 51,444 ( 2nd ) 06/07 48,248 ( 1st ) 07/08 51,215 ( 2nd ) 08/09 55,431 ( 2nd ) 09/10 56,195 ( 1st ) 10/11 59,484 ( 1st ) 11/12 45,664 ( 2nd ) 12/13 46,654 ( 1st ) 13/14 46,246 ( 1st ) 14/15 * 33,189 ( 6th ) * after 16 @entity9 home games and 14 @entity10 home games			1
2004/05 : 63,521 ( 1st highest in @entity93 ) 05/06 : 59,499 ( 1st ) 06/07 46,292 ( 2nd ) 07/08 : 56,906 ( 1st ) 08/09 : 59,731 ( 1st ) 09/10 : 42,951 ( 3rd ) 10/11 : 53,916 ( 2nd ) 11/12 : 49,359 ( 1st ) 12/13 : 43,651 ( 2nd ) 13/14 : 40,061 ( 4th ) 14/15 * : 37,237 ( 3rd ) * after 16 @entity9 home games and 14 @entity10 home games			1
@entity9 players look dejected during a @entity93 match against @entity203 in january ‘ to come back to @entity10 is the biggest challenge , ’ he told @entity205 at the beginning of april , six months after retaking the hot seat in november last year			1
speculation suggests that the 50 - year - old may look to his former club in a bid to breed another successful side , with @entity214 and @entity215 both sounded out as potential summer targets as @entity10 look to rebuild			1
keeping hold of key squad members will be just as important to @entity162 ’s vision though – with the futures of striker @entity64 and goalkeeper @entity55 both far from certain			0
if there is a silver lining for @entity10 , it ’s that their own woes pale in insignificance when compared with @entity9 ’s troubles			1
the @entity9 ’s problems are not solely consigned to the field and relationships have fractured between the club and fans			2
supporters boycotted the recent home game against @entity235 in protest at the way the club is being run and the refusal at board level to shed any light on its future – with details of a possible takeover by @entity246 businessman @entity245 so far withheld			0
unclear , too , is the future of head coach @entity248 after a season stained with indifference			0
like their city rivals however , there is ground on which the green shoots of recovery could grow			0
@entity162 ( left ) and @entity257 ( right ) are currently tasked with leading the clubs into a new era former @entity9 defender and captain @entity48 could return to the club in a role upstairs plans for a new stadium , while not finalised , are being pushed , and talk of a return for club legend @entity48 has also begun to gather pace			1
a change at boardroom level would almost certainly see the former centre back – who spent every one of his 24 years as a professional at @entity9 – offered his first role since retiring in 2009			2
the man himself would probably argue his reintroduction ca n’t come soon enough			0
‘ one of the sources of strength for a club like @entity9 , and for the few other clubs that are alike to @entity9 , is tradition , ’ @entity48 stated in a recent interview with @entity279			2
‘ nowadays the real values of @entity9 are not being tended to			2
’ those values are being called into question by fans of both clubs , as they continue to vote with their feet			0
@entity53 and @entity54 lead an exciting @entity9 team up front in 2005 average attendances at the @entity17 have never been lower this century , dipping under 40,000 for the first time			2
in 2005 , @entity9 boasted the best average in the league with 63,521 , @entity10 taking second spot with 54,150			1
for 2015 those figures read just 37,237 and 33,189 respectively			0
clearly then , there are still bridges to be built between the two fallen giants and their fans			0
it is their attention that matters more ; much more than the gaze of onlookers from across the continent			0
‘ it wo n’t be the same derby of a few years ago , ’ admitted @entity9 full back @entity67 when interviewed by @entity312 this week			1
‘ but we wo n’t be lacking in motivation			0
we want to bring happiness to the club and our fans			0
’ this weekend ’s derby provides both the @entity10 and the @entity9 a chance to restore a touch of pride for supporters at the end of an arduous season			1
restoring either side to its former glory will be a much tougher task still			0
neither @entity10 or @entity9 look like restoring themselves to former glory anytime soon			1

@entity10 host @entity9 in a @entity93 derby this weekend
both clubs are *struggling* to qualify for @entity95 competition
the @entity9 derby used to be a star - *studded* tie with the world *'s* best players
@entity22 game in 2005 was abandoned *due* to flares thrown
the current crop of talent is far cry from the stars 10 years ago
