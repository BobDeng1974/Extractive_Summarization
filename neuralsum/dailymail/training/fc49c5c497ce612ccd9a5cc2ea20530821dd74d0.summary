in the event of a zombie apocalypse , making your way to the @entity4 in the @entity5 might be your best bet for survival			1
a team of scientists at @entity10 have simulated a zombie outbreak in the @entity5 as a novel approach to studying infectious disease			1
using statistical mechanics , the team led by @entity15 simulated millions of interactions between zombies and humans to predict the pace at which a fictional zombie virus might spread			1
‘ we build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the @entity5 , and discover that for realistic parameters , we are largely doomed , ’ said the researchers in their paper			1
@entity27 would fall in days in the event of a zombie apocalypse , as would major cities in the @entity5 due to their population density			1
cities like @entity53 and @entity54 would become overrun with zombies within days , with less densely populated rural areas lasting a few weeks			1
but it would takes months for the infected to reach the northern @entity4 , making the mountains an ideal hiding place to escape the undead hordes			1
‘ at their heart , the simulations are akin to modeling chemical reactions taking place between different elements and , in this case , we have four states a person can be in — human , infected , zombie , or dead zombie — with approximately 300 million people , ’ @entity15 told @entity61			2
run to the hills : it would take months for the infected zombies to reach the @entity4 in the western @entity5 , making the mountain range the best place to escape to			1
the model simulated millions of interractions between infected zombies and humans the zombie apocalypse occurs in many different forms in zombie films			1
space radiation – night of the living dead chemical weapons – @entity90 biological infection – 28 days later , resident evil genetic manipulation – resident evil parasites – @entity97 town magic – white zombie supernatural possession – evil dead depression - warm bodies the simulation has built in randomness : interactions between zombies and humans can go either way			1
sometimes the zombie bites the human victim , infecting them , and sometimes the human is victorious , living to fight another day			0
in this way , each interaction is treated like a radioactive decay , allowing the researchers to calculate the rate of spread throughout the @entity5 where each event - for example the fall of a city - can affect the rate of spread			1
in fictional accounts , ‘ if there is a zombie outbreak , it is usually assumed to affect all areas at the same time , and some months after the outbreak you 're left with small pockets of survivors , ’ explains @entity15			1
‘ but in our attempt to model zombies somewhat realistically , it does n't seem like this is how it would actually go down			1
’ ‘ given the dynamics of the disease , once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas , the whole outbreak slows down — there are fewer humans to bite , so you start creating zombies at a slower rate , ’ said @entity15			1
if the model was applied to the @entity152 , the @entity32 highlands might be the best equivalent to the @entity154 with a very low population density and similar terrain			1
' in general the @entity152 would be harder hit in my model than the @entity5 since it is a much smaller geographical area with larger population densities in general , ' @entity15 told @entity162			1
' all of the @entity152 would fall on a timescale of months			1
the details of course depend on the particular choice of parameters , but we tried to set our parameters to match the behavior of zombies in the movies			2
of course if you wanted it all to be over soon , you should plant yourself in downtown @entity27 , ' he added			0
' @entity176 western @entity32 would likely be some of the last untouched places in the @entity152			1
' nightmare : if the model was applied to the @entity152 , the @entity32 highlands might be the best analogue to the @entity154 with a low population density and similar terrain ( scene from the walking dead pictured ) do n’t fight : zombies would n’t have the neural responses to care about pain , so unless you could shoot to kill , it would be best to run for it			1
keep quiet : zombies with @entity193 would have very little memory and poor concentration , so if you hid , something else would likely capture their attention , keeping you safe			2
distract them : damage to zombies ’ posterior parietal cortex would mean that they could n’t concentrate and would be at the mercy of whatever grabs their attention			2
try fireworks for a quick getaway			0
copy to survive ! zombies would n’t be able to recognise faces so they identify each other by movements and sounds			2
‘ if confronted with a herd of the undead with no clear avenue of escape , do what @entity218 and his friends did in “ @entity221 ” – act like a zombie , the experts said out - run them : this only would only work with @entity193 - 1 zombies , who would only be able to lumber along clumsily			2
do n’t try reason : ‘ @entity193 presents with a massive dysfunction of the language circuits in the brain			0
this means that zombies ca n’t understand what you ’re saying , nor can they talk back , ’ the neuroscientists warn			2
their ‘ fight ’ reaction would dominate , leaving you pleading with an angry hungry zombie			0
mimic them : zombies would n’t be able to recognise faces so they identify each other by movements and sounds			2
‘ if confronted with a herd of the undead with no clear avenue of escape , do what @entity218 and his friends did in “ @entity221 ” – act like a zombie			0
do it with enough accuracy and you can wander through the herd undetected , ’ professors @entity246 and @entity248 say			0
using fictional diseases like a zombie outbreak can be a fun introduction to the complicated maths of disease modelling , according to @entity15			1
if given more time , @entity15 said the team would add more complicated social dynamics , including air travel , evacuations and advance warnings , giving the humans a better chance to prepare			1
the group will present their findings at the 2015 @entity274 , on thursday , march 5 in @entity275 , @entity276			0
the simulation was inspired by the graphic novel @entity278 - which the 2013 movie starring @entity280 was based on - during a graduate statistical mechanics class at @entity10			2
in 2014 scientists analysed zombie behaviour in films , identifying two different types and the areas of the brain likely to be affected based on their characteristics			0
the @entity193 - 1 type is the traditional slow and dumb zombie , while the @entity291 is the fast and frantic type seen in @entity293 if you suppose that zombies are created by a supernatural version of mother nature , it appears she is very clever , because the specific brain changes mean that the consciousness and free will of zombies would be highjacked , but their brain functions needed to hunt , would be preserved			2
‘ @entity307 brain damage does not result in brain damage , ’ the authors say			0
‘ this means the infection spares the neural tissue that ’s needed for spreading the infection , ’ when one zombie bites or eats another human			0
‘ areas necessary for anger , hunger , smelling , seeing , biting and other basic movements remain intact , while obliterating the areas that produce complex thoughts , make proactive decisions or consciously form and recall memories			0
’ @entity323 can be seen in the natural world : a fungus called @entity326 takes over the minds of insects			0
it controls the mind of its host ant , before killing it and releasing spores through its body ( pictured ) while such behaviour is theoretical in humans , there are plenty of examples of zombiism in the animal kingdom			0
a fungus called @entity326 takes over the minds of insects			0
it starts life as a spore that lands on an ant , which slowly stops performing its usual role in a colony , so it ’s thrown out by more diligent worker ants			0
the fungus takes control of the ganglion cells that make up the insect ’s brain , forcing it to bite down hard on a leaf with its mandibles			0
at this point , @entity326 kills its host , causing a stalk to erupt through the ant ’s head and release more zombie spores to secure the fungus ’ grisly existence			0
similarly , a tiny thorny - headed worm of the phylum @entity369 , burrows into the brain of a tiny crustacean , @entity371 , to take control of its nervous system			0
it forces the crab to swim towards the ocean ’s surface where it will be attacked by predators			0
in humans , tapeworms can make its way into the brain to change our behaviour , but a microbe called @entity386 ( @entity387 ) goes a step further			0
found in cat faeces , it can infect humans and stop them fearing risky behaviour , with tragic results .			0

cities would fall in days , according to model of spread of fictional disease
but mountain ranges like the @entity4 would have months to prepare
simulation modeled millions of interactions between zombies and humans
@entity32 highlands might be your best bet if model was applied to @entity152
study was intended as a fun spin on *mathematical* disease modeling
