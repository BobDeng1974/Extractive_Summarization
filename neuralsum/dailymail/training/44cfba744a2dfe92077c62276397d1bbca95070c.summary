sir @entity1 said they were not the right place to care for ‘ old , frail people ’ , and called for community care to be expanded to accommodate the growing elderly population			1
he compared modern treatment of the elderly to the ‘ national scandals ’ of the @entity17 and @entity18 caused by treating mental health patients in large asylums			1
‘ if you think about the average general hospital now , something like 40 per cent of the patients will have some form of dementia , ’ sir @entity1 told @entity22			1
‘ they [ hospitals ] are very bad places for old , frail people			1
we need to find alternatives			0
’ he added : ‘ the nature of our patients is changing – and changing rapidly			0

’ sir @entity1 , who is currently the @entity2 ’s chief executive , was speaking for the first time since his appointment as head of the @entity41			1
the new body will take over responsibility for all @entity2 services in @entity45 from the @entity46 in april			0

if you remember what happened in the 1960s and 1970s , there was a whole series of national scandals about care of mentally ill patients			2
‘ the response was not just to say that the nurses who looked after these patients needed to be more caring , but actually there was something about the way we treated these patients and the model of care that needed to change			0

‘ that ’s a big change			0
