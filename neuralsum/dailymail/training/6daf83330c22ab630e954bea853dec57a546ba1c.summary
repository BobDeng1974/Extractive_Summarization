he may be out of the @entity2 championships – but the reasons for @entity4 ’ s four - letter outbursts during his humiliating defeat by @entity7 were still being feverishly discussed on @entity8 a row with his girlfriend @entity10 a few minutes before play prompt him to turn towards the players ’ box and shout incredulously : ‘ five minutes before the f * * * ing match ? ’ had there been a disagreement with his new coach @entity16 ? and who was the target of his ‘ shut the f * * * up ! ’ attack , which he screamed in the direction of miss @entity23 , @entity25 and his mother @entity26 ? here – as @entity4 prepares to return to training in @entity29 – the @entity27 examines speculation surrounding his flare - up and names the main suspects			1
occasionally she appeared to offer advice beyond the standard ‘ come on @entity4 ! ’ , preferred by much of the @entity43 crowd			1
fact : they did n’t leave together after the match – @entity4 jumped in an @entity58 courtesy car immediately after his post-match press conference and had not changed out of his kit			1
their separate departures would not normally be cause for speculation but miss @entity23 did accompany him after his 2012 defeat by @entity67 – and on wednesday was said to have been ‘ looking upset ’ when she left without him			0
wicked internet speculation that she had chosen five minutes before the big match to dump him / tell him she was pregnant / say she had always liked @entity67 can not be substantiated			0
but the breaking news on thursday night was that miss @entity23 had accidentally let slip the ending of a box - set tv series they had been watching			0
on thursday his grandfather @entity76 , 82 , said of the ‘ five - minutes ’ mystery : ‘ normally he ’ll be alone in his dressing room so i have no idea what could possibly have gone wrong			1
’ seperate exits : @entity23 and @entity4 left @entity83 by themselves on wednesday falling out ? rumours were spreading fast on social media after the defeat @entity87 joins @entity88 in early exit @entity16 : the @entity91 former world number one started coaching @entity4 after he lost in the semi-finals of the @entity93 last month.recently when asked about their professional partnership , she volunteered that things were getting ‘ smoother and smoother ’ perhaps implying there was a time when they were less so			1
fact : miss @entity16 was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors ’ box just moments before @entity4 came on to court to face @entity7			1
did she tell him to change his strategy ? might she have clashed with him over tactics ? was something she said playing on @entity4 ’s brooding mind ? on thursday a track - suited @entity4 arrived at her flat near the ground for a pre-arranged meeting			1
he was carrying what appeared to be a card in an envelope with a single name written on it			0
cards declaring ‘ sorry i told you to shut the f * * * up ’ are not widely available – but in any case , it is @entity16 ’s 35th birthday on saturday			0
the pair spent more than two hours inside before @entity4 left alone			1
but conspiracy theories which suggested coach and player were about to separate amid some unspecified acrimony fell flat when he failed to stomp out in a strop			0
birthday wishes ? @entity4 seemed to be posting a card to @entity16 on thursday keeping calm : the pair had a lengthy chat ... it is unclear whether @entity16 will continue as coach error : @entity16 looks glum on @entity43 as @entity4 crashes out in the quarter - finals @entity87 trains with @entity25 @entity26 : @entity4 ’s mother and long - time former coach remains a constant presence			1
except , that is , for some possibly critical minutes on wednesday at the start of the match			0
fact : mrs @entity26 was at court 18 to cheer her other son , @entity143 , to victory in his mixed doubles opener with @entity147 @entity146			0
little brother @entity4 had already lost the first set by the time she arrived			1
last week @entity4 joked he was ‘ the number two son ’ , and that his family seemed to spend a great deal of time watching the number one			1
another theory : was mrs @entity26 shouting advice that contradicted @entity4 ’s coach ? perhaps			2
but even for a grumpy @entity42 in a foul mood , it is surely beyond the realms of possibility that he would tell his own mother to ‘ shut the f * * * up ’			0
afterwards she stressed she knew of nothing that might have upset him			0
difference of opinion : was @entity26 shouting advice that contradicted @entity16 's ? @entity169 : the couple ’s beloved border terrier , named after the @entity173 hit , has previously used @entity174 throughout her master ’s @entity2 appearances			2
this year she has not tweeted even a bark			0
has she been unwell ? fact : four years ago mrs @entity26 revealed @entity4 was ‘ worried sick ’ throughout the tournament after @entity180 fell ill. the banana : @entity4 has previously relied on bananas for their energy - giving qualities			1
fact : on the advice of a nutritionist , he cut back on bananas last year – and won @entity2			2
this year he admitted he was back on them – and @entity189 : play began on @entity43 at noon rather than the usual time of 1pm			0
@entity4 ’s early start led to suggestions afterwards that he he was not mentally prepared for his game			2
was he given only five minutes ’ notice of the change ? @entity4 dismissed the speculation in his @entity200 blog , declaring : ‘ there was nothing different in the build - up , and no reason to expect that kind of performance			1
’ @entity4 : perhaps the player himself is the only real suspect			2
could it simply be that he lost ? it is the only theory he publicly supports			0
‘ yeah , ’ said @entity4			2
i certainly lost the match , yeah			2
’ pushing himself ? or maybe , the disastrous performance was all down to @entity4 himself ?			0

@entity4 crashed out of @entity2 after defeat to @entity7
former champion lost in straight sets , 1 - 6 , 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) , 2 - 6
