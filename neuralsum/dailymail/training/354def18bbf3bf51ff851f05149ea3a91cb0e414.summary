by @entity1 reporter published : 18:12 est , 1 february 2014 @entity3 : 01:52 est , 2 february 2014 demand : @entity4 , brother of @entity5 , said @entity6 must ' practise what it preaches ' and lock up @entity8 @entity8 could face up to five years in jail in the @entity6 as she awaits extradition to @entity12 , it was revealed last night , as the family of her victim called for her to be ‘ locked up while she waits ’			1
top @entity6 extradition lawyer @entity16 said if her latest conviction for the murder of @entity5 is upheld by the @entity12 @entity19 , she will be put in jail			1
mr @entity16 said : ‘ it is rare for the @entity6 to deny extradition requests from allied countries like @entity12			2
her lawyers would have the chance to appeal and any extradition is a long , drawn - out process which takes between one to five years			0
‘ if @entity12 applies for extradition @entity27 would be arrested by marshals and placed in jail			2
she could apply for bail and may get it but it would be a close call			0
it ’s likely that she will spend one to five years in jail in @entity6 while the process drags on			2
’ @entity5 ’s brother @entity4 told @entity1 : ‘ she should be locked up while the process goes on			1
i do n’t understand why a convicted criminal is not in custody			0
@entity6 needs to practise what it preaches			1
we see cases all the time where they ’re trying to extradite people – @entity45 , @entity46			1
you ca n’t be going around saying one thing and doing another			0
‘ i would be surprised if @entity6 does n’t accept it if @entity12 calls for extradition			2
it would make a mockery of the word reciprocation			0
‘ we would like to see her extradited			0
i would like to see her imprisoned in @entity12			0
i do n’t think it ’s right her remaining in her own country			0
’ but a close friend of the @entity27 family , retired @entity60 judge @entity59 , said : ‘ there is no way @entity63 will spend another night in jail			1
killed : @entity5 , pictured , was found dead in her bedroom in 2007 ' the overwhelming majority of the @entity6 public believe that she is the victim of a chronic miscarriage of justice and that she and indeed the @entity4 family continue to be made victims by this charade going on in @entity12			1
' there would be an outcry if anyone tried to place her in any @entity6 jail			2
it ’s never going to happen			0
’ @entity81 lawyer @entity80 said @entity27 ’s ex-boyfriend @entity82 , 25 , – who remained in @entity12 for the second trial where he was also re-convicted – could end up in prison while she remains free			0
@entity80 said : ‘ @entity12 will ask for extradition but will not obtain anything			0
i mean who would send @entity27 back to @entity12 ? we will have to weigh up what it means to live in @entity12 or the @entity6 if @entity82 ends up in prison and @entity27 free in the @entity89			1
’ ' we will have to weigh up what it means ' : while @entity27 , right , may avoid prison , or spend years in @entity6 awaiting extradition , @entity97 , left , could be jailed much sooner @entity27 , 26 , could be put in @entity98 less than five miles from her father ’s home in @entity60 where @entity27 watched on tv as an @entity12 judge re-convicted her of murder on thursday and sentenced her in her absence to 28 years and six months in jail			1
the ultimate decision about whether to extradite @entity27 will rest with @entity108 , the @entity6 secretary of state who has refused to comment on the case			1
@entity16 said : ‘ there is always room for political pressure but the @entity6 will likely extradite if the @entity12 government requests it because they will not want to get into a diplomatic row with @entity12			2
’ @entity27 has told friends she has written to the @entity4 family offering sympathy for their plight , but @entity5 ’s brother @entity120 added : ‘ if there ’s a letter that has ever been sent to the family my parents never mentioned it and they would have			1
' she ’s never called or written a letter to say sorry for our loss or express any regret			0

@entity5 *'s* brother @entity4 says @entity6 must ' practise what it preaches '
says @entity6 can not ask for @entity46 and @entity45 while refusing to extradite @entity8
but @entity6 legal *experts* doubt that @entity27 will see another night behind bars
