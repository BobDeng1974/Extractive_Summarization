by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:18 est , 2 december 2013 @entity3 has deployed the first of six state - of - the - art submarine - hunting jets to the @entity6 as tensions between @entity8 and @entity9 over a group of disputed islands mounts			1
@entity9 last month established an air defense zone covering islands controlled by @entity8 and claimed by @entity15 - sparking fears that it could lead to an unplanned military incident			1
now the @entity18 is sending @entity20 patrol aircraft which will strengthen @entity3 's ability to hunt submarines and other vessels in seas close to @entity9			1
tensions : @entity26 cram the flight deck of the @entity29 @entity28 during a joint military exercise with @entity8 , last week , in the @entity31 as the territorial row over the disputed islands intensified			1
( @entity34 ) tensions in the volatile region have risen since the @entity37 stated that it ‘ escorted ’ foreign warplanes out of its newly - declared air defence identification zone ( @entity40 )			0
the deployment , planned before @entity9 established the @entity40 , includes six aircraft to be delivered to @entity44 air base on @entity45 this month			2
the first arrived on sunday , a spokesman for the @entity18 told @entity48			0
the mission in the waters west of @entity8 's main islands will be the new aircraft 's first anywhere			1
flashpoint : @entity9 and @entity8 air defense and economic zones and locating the islands in the @entity6 that the two countries have been disputing dispute : relations between @entity8 and @entity9 have become strained as both assert their claims to disputed islets known as the @entity64 in @entity8 and @entity64 islands in @entity9 , in the @entity6			1
( file photo ) the jet , built by @entity68 based on its 737 passenger plane , has been built to replace the aging propeller - powered @entity71 patrol aircraft , which has been in service for 50 years			0
packed with the latest radar equipment and armed with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles , the @entity20 is able to fly further and stay out on mission longer than the @entity78			0
the arrival of the @entity20 came a day before @entity3 vice president @entity80 is due to arrive in @entity81 , a visit that is being overshadowed by the territorial spat in the @entity6 between @entity8 and @entity9			2
while taking no position on the sovereignty of the islands known to the @entity8 as the @entity88 and to the @entity9 as the @entity89 , it does recognize @entity8 control and therefore part of territory it would defend under a security pact with @entity8			1
stand - off : @entity9 last week scrambled fighter jets to monitor two unarmed @entity3 bombers that flew over the @entity6 in defiance of @entity15 's declaration it was exercising greater military control over the area			2
( file photo ) tensions in the region became even more strained last week when @entity9 sent two fighter jets to investigate @entity3 and @entity8 military planes ’ entry into a disputed area of the @entity6			1
@entity15 has declared that all aircraft crossing through airspace must file flight plans and identify themselves or face unspecified ‘ defensive emergency measures ’			0
but the @entity3 , @entity8 and @entity112 have all defied the ruling over the past few days			0
in an intensification of the spat , @entity9 launched fighter jets into the area at the same time as foreign military flights			2
@entity9 @entity37 spokesman colonel @entity119 said warplanes had been scrambled to monitor two @entity3 surveillance aircraft and ten @entity8 planes , including an f - 15 fighter jet , crossing through the @entity40			1
he was reported by state media as saying that the jets had tracked and identified the planes			0
ministers in @entity81 declined to give details of the flights but said the @entity8 @entity37 was on routine operations and had encountered no ‘ abnormal ’ incidents			0
@entity9 announced the creation of the zone			0
it covers a vast area of the @entity6 , including a region where gas has been discovered			0
the row centres on airspace over three uninhabited outcrops called the @entity64 by @entity8 and @entity64 by @entity9			2
@entity140 also has a claim to the islands – bought by @entity8 from private sellers in 2012 , much to the anger of @entity9 – and @entity112 maintains an interest in a submerged rock in the zone known as @entity148			1
the @entity3 called the establishment of the @entity40 a ‘ destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region ’ .			0
