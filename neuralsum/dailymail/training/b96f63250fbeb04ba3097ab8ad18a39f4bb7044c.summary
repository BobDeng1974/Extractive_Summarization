posing confidently for the camera , they exude the magnetic appeal of demure , yet alluring coquettes			2
the subliminal message shrieks that they are glamorous , glorious and – most importantly of all – real women who are n’t afraid to flaunt their flabby bits			2
who can but applaud , we are encouraged to believe , the recent spate of advertisements from the likes of @entity13 and @entity14 cosmetics in which stick - thin , taut and toned models have been rejected in favour of what are euphemistically known as ‘ big ’ girls ? @entity13 use models to promote the retailer 's @entity23 range - dr @entity22 said some could be overweight while ' one was obese ' taking the test : from left , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 gave their verdicts on the underwear after the advert stirred up controversy the message is loud and clear : forget @entity41 and @entity42 , the former faces of all things fashionable , and instead embrace the woman you truly are , complete with your voluptuous curves and pudgy love handles			1
at face value , it all sounds very encouraging			2
very ‘ inclusive ’ , to coin a current buzz word			2
but hold on a minute , are n’t we rather ignoring the elephant in the room here ( pardon the pun ) ? @entity58 , truth be told , is neither a feminist nor a cosmetic issue			2
it is , quite simply , a health issue			2
and we should n’t allow ourselves to be steered into losing sight of that fact			2
it may appear laudable , in our current politically correct climate , to claim that criticising the larger lady is just as despicable as taunting the disabled or discriminating against someone because of their age or origin			0
but , frankly , it ’s utterly wrong			1
the fact is it is absolutely outrageous that , in an effort to illustrate the diversity of women , obesity has taken its place alongside ageing and differing skin colours			1
yes , these adverts have captured the notion of individuality beautifully , by using women in their 50s			0
but including overweight – and therefore unhealthy – women in the mix is downright misguided , at best			1
too good to be true ? the @entity86 asked real women @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity88 and @entity31 to put @entity13 slimming clothes to the test overweight ? the @entity13 models said to represent ordinary women , could be overweight according to the dr for example , in the @entity13 advert , for its shapewear control underwear , which uses women from sizes eight to 16 , i would say that , lovely as they all look , at least two , if not three , are overweight , while the biggest girl is obese			1
yet , when women took to @entity104 to voice their response to the adverts , the majority complained the models were : ‘ too perfect , with too few wobbly bits			0
’ all too often celebrities such as the model @entity111 or @entity112 are touted as real women with real bodies			0
but both have trimmed their figures ( in @entity111 ’s case , by several stone ) and say they are much happier having shed the flab			0
statistics show that the prevalence of obesity in the @entity123 has tripled in the past 25 years but the fact it is now so common does not make it satisfactory or healthy			1
it may seem unfair to criticise what is essentially a very common problem , but day - to - day as a gp i deal with the medical consequences of patients who are overweight			1
obesity makes a woman four times as likely to suffer with high blood pressure and three times as likely to suffer a heart attack			1
according to the @entity139 , obesity costs the @entity140 a staggering £ 5.1billion a year			1
i am really concerned by this trend of supposedly empowering women by what has become known as the ‘ body acceptance movement ’ which embraces the notion that fat is fine			0
while fat may be fine cosmetically , it is not fine for your health			0
body shape has been hijacked solely as a fashion issue , and as ammunition in the war of cool versus uncool			0
thus it is perceived as cruel and ‘ size - ist ’ to attack those who are fat			0
i strongly condemn bullying , whether it be for personal appearance or any other reason , but what worries me is that the real health risks of obesity are being glossed over in an effort not to offend anyone			1
yet , at the same time , we are running around in circles trying to find the obesity solution in the food and fitness industries , as well as the pharmaceutical and medical fields			1
while we readily criticise and ban smoking , junk food is still an acceptable vice and overeating is rapidly becoming the biggest eating disorder in the country			1
indeed , compulsive overeating has recently been recognised in medical literature as a disorder in its own right			0
there is an understandable backlash against the anorexic models the fashion industry has promoted for the past three decades			0
the continuing use of ill - looking , skeletal models is shameful and rightly condemned			0
we know from studies of anorexics that when they idolise and obsess over images of these very thin women , it exacerbates their illness and perpetuates their self - loathing and body dysmorphia			0
is n’t it just as irresponsible to promote the notion that being overweight is perfectly normal ? the @entity201 on @entity202 was established in 2011 to challenge the growing trend in negative body image and they work with those such as the advertising industry to address this issue			1
they have , for example , stopped the use of size zero models			0
while this is admirable , we need to ensure that , by trying to sort out one problem , we do n’t exacerbate another			0
given that a third of @entity123 women are overweight , it will do our teenage daughters no favours to normalise obesity			1
companies such as @entity13 have a firm place in the hearts of the public and in that respect they often mould opinions and shape our aspirations			1
it is a shame they wasted a great opportunity to promote what is healthy .			0

dr @entity22 : ' it is utterly wrong *...* obesity has taken its place alongside ageing and differing skin colours . '
' two , if not three , are overweight , while the biggest girl is obese ' the *doctor* claims
