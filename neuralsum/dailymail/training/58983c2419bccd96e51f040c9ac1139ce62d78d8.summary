by @entity0 published : 21:59 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 21:59 est , 11 june 2013 growing change : environment secretary @entity2 wants rules relaxed on @entity5 crops for @entity7 farmers @entity7 ministers want the @entity9 to relax restrictions on the cultivation of genetically - modified crops			1
@entity2 wants to make it easier for farmers to grow @entity5 plants for human consumption , even though critics lambast the idea as ‘ @entity19 ’			1
in a speech next week , the environment secretary is expected to cite growing scientific evidence that @entity5 foods are safe , as well as surveys showing a relaxation of the rules would be supported by the majority of farmers			1
mr @entity2 will say there is a need for a new approach to @entity5 to ensure @entity7 ‘ is not left behind ’ in agricultural science			1
however , any such move will be in the teeth of much opposition			0
a survey by @entity37 out today found only 21 per cent of the population supported the technology , while 35 per cent opposed it			0
yesterday science minister @entity40 supported calls for controls on @entity5 crops to be weakened			1
‘ we believe @entity5 crops can help make agriculture more efficient and also just as importantly more sustainable , by , for example , reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels , ’ he said			1
@entity52 sources told the independent newspaper that ministers are increasingly concerned that the potential moral and ethical benefits of @entity5 are being ignored by costly and bureaucratic licensing regulations			0
a twelfth of global arable land is under @entity5 cultivation , and ministers fear @entity7 – the birthplace of the 18th century agrarian revolution that modernised the world – faces being left behind			2
@entity5 crops can be engineered to grow faster , increase their resistance to weeds , pests and pesticides , produce extra nutrients or survive harsher weather			1
but while they are widely grown in the @entity71 , they are effectively banned in the @entity7 and @entity72 where they are considered on an extremely strict case - by - case basis			2
ministers argue that gm technology has the potential to improve crop yields , help the agricultural industry and provide benefits to human health through vitamin fortification			0
it could also help combat diseases such as ash dieback and help in the development of new medicines			0
genetically improved ? minsters believe @entity5 crops could ' make agriculture more efficient ' and help eradicate diseases such as dieback in the @entity7 a source told the @entity94 : ‘ the point about @entity5 is not simply about food production			1
‘ there are wider potential environmental and economic benefits to the technology both in the @entity7 and internationally			2
‘ what we want to do is start a dialogue within @entity72 on @entity5 , based upon the science			0
’ mr @entity2 wants to build support in @entity106 for a relaxation of @entity5 rules and hopes powerful @entity109 will come on side			2
but others will be opposed			0
in april , @entity112 became the eighth @entity9 member state to ban the cultivation of @entity5 crops			2
a poll of more than 600 @entity7 farmers found a considerable shift in their stance toward @entity5 over the past year			1
nearly a third said they would be more likely to grow the crops now than they were a year ago			0
@entity122 of the @entity123 ’ @entity9 said : ‘ farmers are becoming more and more aware that climate change does n’t mean a gradual rise in temperatures but rather a stream of extreme weather events			0
gm technology is one possible way of mitigating this			0

environment secretary wants @entity7 farmers to grow @entity5 crops for humans
@entity2 to make speech *proclaiming* gm foods as safe
genetically - modified technology could eradicate diseases such as dieback
