@entity2 winger @entity1 's imminent return can not come soon enough for @entity4 teammate @entity3			1
@entity1 needed surgery after rupturing knee ligaments against @entity7 in january but his rehabilitation is almost complete and @entity9 midfielder @entity3 believes the winger 's comeback will spark the north @entity14 club 's season			1
' i 've never played with someone before who times their runs so perfectly and keeps doing it , time after time , ' @entity3 told arsenal.com on monday			0
@entity1 made his return to match action in an @entity24 match against @entity25 last week @entity1 also returned to first - team training , as he steps up his recovery from knee ligament damage the @entity2 @entity30 account tweeted @entity1 after his first training session back last week ' he gives us something different , he gives us pace			1
i know we 've got @entity35 who gives us pace but @entity1 gives you something different without the ball			0
' it 's a dream for a midfielder			0
' with @entity2 short on firepower and languishing 11 points behind @entity48 leaders @entity44 after eight games , @entity1 's return will be a major boost			1
especially as @entity3 believes he has returned from injury as an even speedier player			2
' he 's got physically stronger and he looks quicker than he did before , that might seem impossible but he does , ' @entity3 said			0
' he 's done a lot of work on his quads and his power so he 's going to come back fine			0
