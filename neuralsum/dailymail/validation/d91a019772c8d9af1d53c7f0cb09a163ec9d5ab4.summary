as if he did n’t already know , @entity0 found out the hard way last saturday that 80 minutes can be a long time in rugby			1
@entity3 were riding the crest of a wave arriving into @entity6			1
ten successive wins and the @entity8 there for the taking			1
eighty minutes later , their unbeaten run was over and now they face the very real prospect of being left with nothing to show for their efforts in 2015			2
a year ago they had momentum going into the closing round of the championship			2
they led the table with a huge points difference and , after @entity24 fell short of eclipsing that target in @entity26 , there were no outside complications weighing on @entity3 ’s mind in that evening ’s tournament closer : beat @entity31 and the title was theirs			1
@entity33 ( left ) , @entity34 ( centre ) and @entity36 warm - up during @entity3 training on thursday @entity3 flanker @entity39 fires out a backhand pass during @entity3 's session at their base in @entity43 @entity44 ( centre ) and his fellow @entity47 players are gearing up for their crunch clash against @entity49 twelve months later they are in an awkward bind — second on points difference with no exact clarity on what type of win is needed to retain their title given that @entity24 will be last into action tomorrow			1
adding to @entity3 ’s anxiety is their inability to get over the try line			1
whereas 16 were scored in the title run in 2014 run , there have been just four in 320 minutes this term			1
@entity0 , though , claims not to be worried about the drought , adding that a level of tolerance must be shown towards the development of his new midfield combination now that @entity71 has retired and @entity72 has been omitted for the @entity73			1
‘ the game is very fickle , ’ he claimed after announcing a team to play @entity49 showing two changes from @entity76 with @entity77 and @entity78 getting in ahead of @entity79 and @entity80			1
‘ one week you might score three tries and the next week you might not get any and you might have played better in the second week but you just did n’t convert the opportunities			2
@entity3 coach @entity86 will put his friendship with @entity49 boss @entity88 to one side on saturday ‘ one of the frustrations from last week is that we did create three really clear try - scoring opportunities that we did n’t convert			1
last year , we converted a lot of our try - scoring opportunities			0
they are the very fine margins			0
‘ trying to make sure we get on the right side of those margins all the time is difficult and it is something we ’re working really hard on , ’ claimed the attack coach whose specialist role in preparing the team is now under scrutiny as @entity3 ’s meagre try tally is the joint worst in the tournament , level with @entity31 and seven tries fewer than top scorers @entity24			1
the lack of finishing power has cast a spotlight on the rookie centre pairing of @entity33 and @entity113			0
‘ @entity33 does n’t have a lot of test match experience but has played a lot of @entity117 and @entity119 rugby			0
that breadth of experience and his maturity helps @entity113 work away			0
‘ @entity71 does n’t leave a team and suddenly there ’s no deficit			0
the guys who have come in in his place have done a super job , but they ca n’t do the same job			0
‘ they ’re doing the job with a different experience and a different knowledge of the game at that level			0
i ’m not a patient man , i ’m not going to say that we ’re being patient about it but we have to be a little bit tolerant of the development that needs to take place			0
@entity0 and @entity88 ( above ) worked together with @entity142 in @entity31 and in @entity143 with @entity144 ‘ we do have a little inexperience at 12 but i do n’t think you could fault @entity113 ’s form right through the championship and he will grow into that first - receiver role when it ’s demanded of him a little bit more as he gains experience			1
‘ one of the things i do feel we will get a benefit from is working our way through this championship			0
having a loss , the first one in over a year , we need to stay balanced in how we ’re preparing and do n’t necessarily have to go too far away from what we ’ve been doing			0
’ @entity0 , who revealed training on tuesday was as flat as it had ever been but was fresh on thursday , insists that guaranteeing victory in @entity49 — not focusing on the margin of a potential win — has been his approach , so much so that he admits he is n’t much inclined to pass much heed of how @entity76 fare in @entity26 prior to saturday ’s 2.30pm start ( @entity76 need a +22 win to have bettered @entity3 ’s points difference )			1
it may well depend on what that margin is but i do n’t think you try to do anything different			0
you ’re just looking to try to get the win … and there ’s no point trying to anticipate what the @entity31 - @entity24 result will be			2
‘ what will be really difficult is a really good @entity184 side			2
they have narrow losses right through and have a better balance to their side this week			2
it ’s going to be a real challenge			0
i ’ve read comments about how desperate they are to give an account of themselves that is sufficient to get them over the line			0

@entity0 and @entity88 worked together at @entity142 in the @entity198
the pair were also coaching *partners* at @entity144 in @entity143
@entity3 *surrendered* their @entity8 hopes against @entity76 last saturday
but @entity0 's side can still claim the title on points difference
a *big* win over @entity49 is the target for @entity3 on saturday
