this footage captures the nail - biting moment a dangerously triple - stacked lorry leans treacherously to one side as its driver attempts to navigate a busy roundabout at speed			1
nervous motorists attempted to keep their distance as the vehicle , carrying three skips , shifted one way then the next - appearing to come terrifyingly close to toppling			1
one driver said the lorry went so fast that the wheels appeared to lift off the ground as it shot over two roundabouts			1
' i decided to video just in case it was a you 've been framed sketch			2
' he posted the startling video on @entity41 where @entity42 commented : ' @entity43 right dangerous			0
both driver and company should be fined			2
' @entity46 added : ' that 's insane , looks like the car on the roundabout had a lucky escape ! ' @entity51 said : ' the top skip should n't have even been allowed on			2
if that falls off then it could have caused a hell of bad things ! ' @entity57 , 57 , who runs @entity58 , defended his driver - but said he would tell him not to stack the skips so high in future			1
unbelievable : the lorry 's huge load towers into the air as it approaches the roundabout and he even accused the motorist who filmed the footage of dangerous driving			1
he said : ' it looks high , and i 've instructed the worker driving the lorry not to stack it that high again , but it does not exceed the legal weight or height limit			2
' we use a compressor to push the waste so the skip on top can squash in			0
' in this case it was bulky wood which does not compress , but he put all three on there anyway so the skips were stacked higher			0
' there were also four chains pulling the skips down			0
no wheels came off the ground			0
nerve - wracking : as the lorry approaches the roundabout at speed it turns to the left causing the three precariously - loaded skips to shift to the right dangerous : one driver , @entity24 , 37 , filmed the scene on his phone and claims that the lorry 's tyres actually lifted off the ground ' he could have been going a bit slower around the roundabout but air suspension stops too much tipping and the skips were hydraulically chained and pulled down			1
' the person who took the video ought to think about his own actions			0
he was using a mobile phone at the wheel which is dangerous			1
' i 've been running this business since 1984 and never had a lorry tip over			0
' a spokesman for @entity120 said that they are not investigating the incident .			0
