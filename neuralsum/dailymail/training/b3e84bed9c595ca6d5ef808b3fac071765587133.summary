there has been a great deal spoken about the sweltering heat and humidity @entity4 will face in @entity5 when they play @entity6 on saturday night			1
but how does it actually feel to run and exercise in such testing conditions ? with the help of a @entity12 biodome , an industrial - sized heater and a treadmill , @entity9 found out			2
it takes less than 10 seconds for the first bead of sweat to start trickling its way down from my forehead , off the tip of my nose and on to my soon - to - be - saturated shirt			2
it 's a little disheartening for someone who considers themselves fairly fit , and is currently in training for a half - marathon , to be perspiring so uncontrollably after just a minute or so of exercise			2
feeling the heat : @entity32 's @entity9 gets going on the treadmill inside a biodome that replicates the hot and humid conditions @entity4 will experience when they face @entity6 in @entity5 on saturday night ramp it up : as our man reaches full speed on the treadmill , the @entity38 heat and 80 per cent humidity starts to take its toll venue : the @entity45 will host @entity4 's first @entity47 match , against @entity6 on saturday evening ready , boys ? @entity4 have been gradually acclimatising to the hot conditions in @entity50 but then the sweltering conditions of @entity5 have no mercy on anyone , not even the super-fit elite footballers who will play there during the @entity47			1
i 'm running on a treadmill in a @entity58 set up by @entity59 in @entity12 to replicate the extreme conditions @entity4 will encounter when they step out to play @entity6 at the @entity45 on saturday week			0
outside , the late spring day is grey and drizzly but this ' @entity62 ' feels like a pressure - cooker as industrial - sized heaters relentlessly circulate chokingly hot air			0
the hard yards : @entity9 winds down after running for 10 minutes in the ' mini-manaus ' biodome built by @entity59 in @entity12 welcome refreshment : the cold water is very much necessary after completing the ' @entity62 ' challenge the thermometer reads @entity72 , the average temperature in @entity5 at this time of year , and the humidity sits just above the 80 per cent mark			1
these are conditions in which even walking down the street is an effort , so playing 90 minutes of high - intensity football is not an attractive option			1
i manage about 10 minutes of running on the treadmill , working up from a walk to an all - out sprint , before the temptation to throw water all over myself becomes too great			0
each match at the @entity47 will factor in drinks breaks , and these will be absolutely essential for the players to take on water or an energy drink and rehydrate			1
warmer climes : a game of football being played on the beach in @entity5 flavour of the @entity97 : @entity9 outside the heated biodome built in @entity12 to replicate the sweltering , tropical conditions in @entity5 the paramedic on standby at the @entity58 measures my core body temperature at a normal @entity103 before stepping on the treadmill			1
at the end , it ’s nudging above @entity107 , the kind of level when you ’re suffering from a fever			0
it ’s a relief to step outside the dome again , into the cooling @entity114 drizzle , and i have plenty of sympathy for the @entity4 players who will have to cope with these energy - sapping conditions while carrying the weight of the nation ’s expectation			0
go to @entity123 / manaus to take the challenge yourself and to win £ 10,000 in free bets			0

@entity128 , @entity129 will face high temperatures and humidity in @entity5
@entity97 venues is the hottest of the @entity50 @entity47 venues
temperatures will top @entity137 , with humidity at a *stifling* 80 per cent
