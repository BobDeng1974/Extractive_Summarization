the lighting of the @entity2 cauldron at last night 's opening ceremony was , if nothing else , wonderfully unique			1
the giant flame 's design was so sophisticated the studio where it was crafted looked more like @entity12 's gadget workshop , its architect revealed today			2
@entity13 said he was pleasantly surprised when the idea to have 204 separate petals come together to form one giant flame got the go - ahead from a range of officials including prime minister @entity20 and @entity22 chairman @entity21			1
the one lit in @entity44 four years ago weighed a staggering 300 tonnes			1
mr @entity13 , who developed it at his @entity13 in @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' we were aware cauldrons had been getting bigger , higher , fatter as each @entity2 happened and we felt we should n't try to be even bigger than the last ones			1
' this incredible event has 204 nations coming together , so we had a child from each country bringing these copper polished objects in			0
' at the end of the @entity2 , this cauldron will dismantle itself and radiate back down to the ground and each of those copper pieces take away by each nation and put in a national @entity2 cabinet somewhere			0
' blooming marvellous : this series of photographs shows each of the 204 copper and steel petals of the @entity2 cauldron being lit before being lifted up to form one giant flame the @entity71 of the @entity2 ( @entity71 ) requested the flame be powered by natural gas , which is pumped individually through the stems of each petal			1
a spokeswoman told @entity76 : ' the multiple burners means that the burn - rate is flexible			0
' the gas flow can be reduced very significantly - this means we can reduce our gas consumption from 100 per cent down to 15 per cent			2
' we are constantly monitoring the flow rate to ensure the minimum quantity of gas is burned			2
' @entity71 is also working with energy company @entity86 to see that all of the carbon emissions will be offset			1
intricate engineering has gone into the design to ensure the flame does not go out , in any ' unforeseen circumstances ' it will relit by the ' mother flame ' kindled in @entity95 , @entity96			2
the copper petals , created to be ' very small and humble objects ' , were made using traditionally skilled craftsmen of the sort who used to roll sheet metal to make body parts for car makers such as @entity105 , according to mr @entity13			1
he said : ' it is like the biggest gadget that anyone can make in a shed but this shed is the most sophisticate shed in @entity111			0
' it was like the @entity12 gadget workshop			0
' more than a billion people who watched globally along with the 70,000 - plus crowd inside the stadium saw the unique petals being carried by each of the children as they accompanied each @entity2 team into the stadium for the athletes ' parade			1
the rods which make up the stem of the cauldron are made of stainless steel with a heat and acid treatment that makes it a colour called bad black , which is actually slightly blue			1
the petals are copper and the entire structure is about 8.5 metres tall and will be moved from the centre of the stadium overnight tomorrow			1
it will move to the end of the stadium where the huge bell was struck to signal the start of the opening ceremony			0
like the cauldron the @entity47 1948 organisers used when the @entity2 were last staged in the capital , the cauldron will stay alight inside the stadium rather than being pitched above it			2
the cauldron design team used the fact that the athletes ' parade is a long event , lasting at least 90 minutes , to retrieve the elements from the centre of the parade and discreetly fix them to specific spots on the cauldron			2
practice had to be done at night as the lighting of the cauldron had to be kept @entity161 were held in the north of @entity163 , but were switched to the stadium nearer to the grand event			2
mr @entity13 said : ' it had to stay a secret			1
we had to wait until the dancers had gone home so it was about 3am - that was the time that it ( the stadium ) was available for use to use			0
' the seven teenage up - and - coming athletes who made up the final torchbearers had 45 seconds to light the cauldron			1
there was then a 45 - second wait before it all lifted into place			0
by the time the first ring was in place the last one was lifting and coming together			0
' so it was like a dandelion seed being blown - but it seemed to work , which was a huge relief , ' mr @entity13 said			1
mr @entity13 said he and artistic director @entity188 , the mastermind behind the opening ceremony , wanted something that was not about being bigger than the last @entity2 cauldron , in @entity44 , but was about the people involved in bringing it together			1
this is one of the reasons why is was set in the centre of the stadium with the parading athletes surrounding it			0
he said : ' we were thinking about this incredible object with 204 nations coming together			0
it was a challenge but it did not feel enough to design a different shaped bowl			0
' historic moment : five - time olympic gold medal rower @entity205 carries the @entity2 flame into the opening ceremony for the start of ritual lighting of the cauldron break from tradition : flames are handed to seven young athletes nominated by past champions to light the cauldron 's petals the cauldron will be split up at the end of the @entity2 and each piece will be returned to a competing national olympic committee ( @entity221 )			1
mr @entity13 said : ' the cauldron will dismantle itself and come back to the ground			1
these pieces will be taken away by the noc			0
' they will be these heated elements , maybe they will get buffed , but everyone will have a piece			0
' @entity13 was established in 1994 by mr @entity13 , an honorary fellow of the @entity229 and a senior fellow at the @entity231 of @entity232 he is the recipient of honorary doctorates from four @entity235 universities – @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239			2
he has won the @entity240 and , in 2006 , was the youngest practitioner to be appointed a @entity242			0
unique creation : artist @entity13 ( pictured ) , who designed the cauldron , said he wanted to create a smaller flame than one used in previous years he has served on numerous judging and advisory panels and has given lectures , tutorials and talks at the @entity252 , @entity47 ’s @entity253 and @entity254			1
the opening ceremony , put together by @entity256 - winning director @entity188 , had been cut to three hours to ensure athletes did not get stranded and left unable to get home			2
it was only when organisers put the final rehearsals together that they realised it would run too late for public transport			2
but some viewers were miffed that it still did n't finish until gone 12.30am			0
@entity266 tweeted : ' a great opening ceremony for @entity268 last night			0
but i am very tired this morning as it was a late finish			0
' @entity271 added : ' not a bad opening ceremony , late finish though ! ' olympics minister @entity274 previously denied the cut had been forced because of problems with the @entity278 security firm who failed to employ enough guards for the @entity2			0
video : designer @entity13 talks about the cauldron & how the bookies were all wrong ! ...			1

@entity13 surprised unique design given go - ahead by 2012 chiefs
fuelled by natural gas which is pumped through each of its 204 petals stems
petals made from steel using acid treatment that gives it ' bad black ' colour
organisers working with @entity86 energy to ensure all emissions will be offset
rehearsals carried out at night to keep details a *closely* guarded secret
entire structure weighs just 16 tonnes . cauldron in @entity44 was 300 tonnes
