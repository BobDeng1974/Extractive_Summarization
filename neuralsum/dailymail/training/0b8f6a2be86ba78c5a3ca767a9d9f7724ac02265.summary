there ’s no place like home , as @entity3 will testify			1
it ’s two games , two wins for @entity8 ’s new manager and his decision to quit @entity10 and return to the club where he spent five years as a player is looking an astute one			1
having secured @entity8 ’s first win in nine matches in beating @entity18 , he maintained his 100 per cent start to life at @entity21 with this victory over @entity23			1
having fallen behind to @entity25 ’s strike , @entity8 turned the game around			1
if @entity3 ’s @entity8 are n’t quite soaring , their wings are finally flapping			1
and that is more than could be said for the side under former boss @entity31			0
@entity3 celebrates with fans after winning his first @entity34 match in charge of @entity8 @entity25 was on target yet again to give @entity23 the lead at @entity21 on saturday evening @entity3 has won 13 points from losing positions this season , more than any other @entity34 boss			1
there is an inescapable sense that these players want to perform for their manager — to give him the homecoming he dreamed about			0
we wo n’t see the fruits of @entity3 ’s work on the training field for a few weeks , though keeping possession seems to be a key objective			1
@entity3 said following the @entity53 win at @entity18 that his side would be taking risks on the ball			1
that was certainly the case on saturday			0
one passage of play in the 14th minute , which saw @entity8 ’s defenders pass their way out of trouble , drew applause from the supporters			2
players were often satisfied just to clear their lines under @entity31			0
if saturday is anything to go by , those days are gone			0
the reintroduction of @entity71 is an indication of the passing style @entity3 wants to implement			2
the @entity74 was a peripheral figure under @entity31 and @entity76 but has started both games under @entity3			1
@entity71 is n’t one to hoof the ball — he saw plenty of possession before being subbed at half - time having picked up a yellow card			0
palace boss @entity3 has brought @entity71 in from the cold at @entity8 to start the last two games @entity85 shoots to score his penalty against @entity23 on saturday evening for @entity8 bringing back @entity71 suggests @entity8 will play with a technically gifted midfield pivot			1
whether @entity71 is that man long - term remains to be seen			0
he needs to cool his temper first			0
a clearer idea of how @entity71 fits into @entity3 ’s plans will emerge once captain @entity93 is back from @entity95 duty with @entity96			2
indeed , the pending returns of @entity93 and @entity98 , who is at the @entity99 with @entity100 , will provide @entity3 with a massive boost in the coming weeks			2
@entity98 , in particular , will add a fresh attacking dimension — not that @entity8 looked short of ideas against @entity23			1
there was a tendency under @entity31 to overuse the flanks , relying on the pace of @entity98 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity85 to get in behind the opposition			0
that remained a fruitful avenue on saturday as second - half goal - scorers @entity109 and @entity85 caused a host of problems			2
@entity85 celebrates his equaliser for the @entity8 against the north @entity118 side in the 69th minute @entity109 made it 2 - 1 against @entity23 as @entity8 continue to fight relegation likewise , @entity122 ’s blistering 20 - minute cameo will raise hope the forward , on loan from @entity125 , can recapture the form that made him the most sought after youngster in the country two years ago			1
@entity3 , though , is determined to strengthen his squad			2
@entity8 have been rebuffed in a loan move for @entity132 striker @entity131 , though the club may revisit that deal later in the window			2
@entity108 made a positive impact from the bench for @entity8 on saturday @entity138 of @entity139 is in the frame , but @entity141 is likely to be out of @entity8 ’s price range			1
@entity144 ’s @entity143 is expected to arrive this week			0
@entity3 said : ‘ this result does n’t change my mind about the transfer window			1
we still need one or two			0
that is progressing well and we hope to have some news this week			0
‘ i had a chat with @entity152 but @entity131 is n’t going anywhere			0
i know @entity141 from my @entity154 days and i know what he can do			0

@entity3 won his first @entity34 match in charge of @entity8 on saturday with a 2 - 1 win against @entity23
as a result the @entity8 moved out of the relegation *zone* and into 15th
@entity3 has overseen two victories in his opening two games in charge
sense of *belief* around @entity21 that they can now avoid the drop
