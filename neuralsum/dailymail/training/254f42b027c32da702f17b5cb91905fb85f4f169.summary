by @entity0 published : 03:23 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 03:42 est , 12 july 2012 @entity3 's border chaos is getting worse as hundreds of rookie staff with no experience are manning immigration desks at @entity7 in a desperate attempt to cut queues during the @entity10 , a watchdog said today			1
workers brought in to ease congestion in the arrivals hall are actually increasing waiting times because they lack confidence and are too slow at processing passengers , according to @entity17 , the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration			1
with just weeks to go until the @entity20 , mr @entity17 added the queues are lengthening even though these amateurs are asking less questions than full time border staff			1
chaos : rookie staff with little or no training are manning immigration desks at @entity7 during the @entity10 the @entity29 is also rehiring ex-employees who left their jobs as it prepares to deal with more than 100,000 passengers a day during the busiest periods of the @entity10 , he revealed			1
some staff ' remained concerned about the potential risks of employing staff on the immigration control who had received only basic training and who had no immigration background / experience ' , mr @entity17 said in his report			1
' @entity43 also expressed concerns about similar problems recurring after the @entity10 , if resources were not sufficient to meet the increasing passenger flows coming through @entity7			0
' only yesterday huge queues were building up at @entity7 after half of all the immigration desks were shut - even though the @entity10 are just weeks away			0
official figures showed the wait at immigration control for @entity55 passengers was 56 minutes despite a 45 minute target			0
complaints : border inspector @entity17 says that problems are getting worse not better immigration minister @entity59 has pledged that all immigration desks at the @entity3 's largest airport will be staffed during busy times from sunday to avoid what @entity64 mp @entity63 said could be a ' national embarrassment ' of long queues			1
some 500 extra staff have been drafted in to achieve this , including those who had retired or moved on to other jobs , and all are having a positive impact on queues , the @entity29 said			1
mr @entity17 said the @entity10 measures will involve 're - employing former immigration staff who had left the business ( or who may be working elsewhere within @entity29 , the @entity78 or the @entity79 ) '			1
training will also be given to other @entity79 and @entity78 staff to enable them to work on the immigration desks , known as the primary control point , the report said			1
but the inspection in april found that officers brought in to the immigration desks from the secondary examination area ' appeared less confident when processing passengers '			0
' this meant they often took longer to process them and asked fewer probing questions , ' the inspectors said			1
' we felt this affected how efficiently and effectively @entity29 was able to progress passengers through the terminal			0
' mr @entity17 added : ' @entity99 must ensure any new framework of border security checks , set out in its operating mandate , are resourced appropriately to deliver an efficient and effective service			1
' he also questioned whether equipment to detect forged documents was being used correctly as detection levels in @entity107 were more than a third lower than in @entity108			0
some 275 forgeries were detected in @entity108 between april 2010 and march this year , compared with 177 in @entity107			0
some staff reported that this was ' partly the result of faulty forgery detection equipment at some of the desks ' in @entity107			2
busy : @entity7 will see an unprecedented number of passengers fly in during the @entity20 but there are fears they wo n't cope ' we are aware that some of this variation might be explained by the different types of passenger traffic at each terminal , ' mr @entity17 said			1
' however , we believe that @entity29 should commence work to ensure that issues around use of equipment and training are not having an adverse impact on forgery detection			0
' a @entity29 spokeswoman said the report showed there had been ' real improvements at @entity7 '			0
' @entity17 acknowledges the positive addition of hundreds of extra staff deployed to meet demand , the creation of a central control room to manage resources and on - going recruitment of more border officers , ' she said			1
' @entity29 has already addressed concerns raised during the april inspection including staff being issued with the operating mandate to reinforce clear standards for carrying out border checks			2
' we are also working with ( airport operator ) @entity153 on improving queue measurement , looking at securing staffing levels for the long - term and continued training and mentoring for contingency staff to ensure they carry out efficient and secure check on passengers			2
' shadow home secretary @entity163 said : ' the @entity10 countdown has started yet the home secretary still has n't sorted the chaos at our borders caused by her decision to cut so many staff this year			2
're - employing former immigration staff , having cut nearly 900 people from the @entity29 since the general election , is a damning self - admission of failure and a waste of taxpayer 's money too			2
' the scale of staff cuts and the home secretary 's failure to sort out the management problems has meant queues of over two hours just weeks before the @entity10 start			2
' the government say @entity78 had a ' bad april ' , but the truth is they 're having a bad year because of this government 's failure			0
' she added that the report ' raises serious concerns that as well as long queues , people who should be questioned further are not being properly examined '			0
@entity193 , @entity64 chairman of the @entity194 , said : ' i am deeply concerned that the @entity29 staff being placed at immigration desks lack the proper training to conduct thorough immigration checks			1
' with millions of people set to arrive at @entity7 over the @entity10 period this situation is unacceptable			0
it must be rectified quickly			0
' immigration minister @entity59 declined to confirm that all desks would be open at @entity7 at peak times beyond the @entity10			2
' what we will do is revert to normal - normal in terms of making sure that the number of desks occupied are appropriate for the number of passengers because the actual flow of passengers does change very rapidly , ' he told @entity215 's today programme			2
challenged to say whether all desks would be open at peak times after the @entity10 , he said : ' at peak times before the @entity10 we have made a commitment and what we will do is do our best to ensure that the desks at peak times , there will obviously be more people there than at not peak times			0
' we will be much more scientific about when and where people are there to cope with the flows as they come in			0

chief inspector @entity17 says the move is making waiting times longer not shorter
staff have lack of *expertise* and confidence , he says
