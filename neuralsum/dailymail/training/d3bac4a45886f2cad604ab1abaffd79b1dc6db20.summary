by @entity0 published : 07:13 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 02:09 est , 17 october 2013 a teenager whose symptoms of cancer were constantly dismissed as teenage ' grumpiness ' has spoken of her sadness that she will never be able to have children			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , began to feel tired and suffered from a constant pain in her left side from late 2011			1
but it took a year for doctors to diagnose a rare and aggressive form of ovarian cancer that had spread so much she needed her ovaries , fallopian tubes and appendix removed - leaving her infertile at 19			1
but doctors failed to take her symptoms seriously because of her age and she was only diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer nearly a year later she told @entity27 : ‘ it was n't easy convincing anyone i was ill. i had a pain in my left side that never seemed to go away			1
‘ i also felt tired all the time and started to give up things that i ’d always loved , like dancing and musical theatre			0
' i went to the doctor and explained but she dismissed me as being a grumpy teenager			2
' over time , the pain got worse and worse and it got to the point where she could n’t get out of bed			2
' i was taking painkillers all the time but they did n’t help , ' says @entity7 , now 20			1
' i was also going to the loo more often – now i know that ’s because the tumour was pressing on my bladder			0
' treatment : after eventually being diagnosed , @entity7 began six months of chemotherapy in february and had lost all her hair within a month			1
despite her gruelling treatment , she remained positive , pictured here with her grandmother having playfully stolen her wig after five visits , her gp conceded she might have a cyst			0
' but i disagreed , says @entity7			1
' a cyst would n’t make me feel so weird all the time , but she would n't listen			0
’ ‘ about two years before , i ’d had a @entity62 cancer awareness session at school , so i knew i had to keep going back if the symptoms persisted			1
eventually as the pain got worse i was sent for a scan which did show a mass , but i was still told it was a cyst and nothing to worry about			1
’ because of the doctor ’s lack of concern over her symptoms , @entity7 was marked down as non-urgent and waited eight months for an operation to remove the cyst			1
by the time the operation came round in november last year , she felt worse than ever : ‘ i told the surgeon i had concerns , and for the first time someone listened to me			0
‘ looking back , this conversation may have saved my life			0
the surgeon agreed to have an extra look about while he was in there			0
’ when she came round from the operation , the surgeon explained he had removed the cyst , but had also sent some other tissue for testing			0
‘ he told me it was most likely an infection , ’ says @entity7			1
but a few weeks later she was called for an urgent scan			0
‘ i said to my parents " i think i have cancer " but they thought i was being dramatic , ’ recalls @entity7			1
‘ but i just knew it – you know when you ’re not well			0
’ the news that followed was devastating			0
‘ the only words i remember the surgeon saying were “ it ’s cancer ” – i do n't remember the rest of the meeting			2
i could n’t speak and i felt numb			0
how could this be happening to me ? i was 19 and scared			2
@entity7 is now in remission and urging other teenagers not to ignore persistent symptoms such as extreme tiredness and pain ‘ but , on the other hand , it was a relief that i had finally got a diagnosis , having spent so long trying to convince everyone there was something wrong with me			1
' doctors at @entity117 explained she would need further surgery , scheduled for @entity119 : ‘ i was told the cancer was probably small because it had n’t been picked up on the scan			2
they could n't have been more wrong			0
’ @entity123 had revealed @entity7 had a rare form of ovarian cancer called @entity126 – and surgeons had been forced to remove her ovaries , fallopian tubes and appendix as it had spread so much			1
surgeons were forced to remove @entity7 's ovaries , fallopian tubes and appendix as the cancer had spread so much			1
she is pictured singing at a @entity62 event the radical surgery meant she had been thrown into the menopause at 19 and would never be able to have children			1
‘ it felt horrible to suddenly be infertile , ’ says @entity7			1
‘ i had always wanted to have a family one day and did n’t have time to save any eggs because my ovaries had been removed so suddenly			2
i remember just lying in the ward , crying			0
i can never conceive a child , which still hurts me			0
i also started my menopause at just 19 , something else my friends would n't understand			1
in february this year , a month after surgery , @entity7 began six months of chemotherapy			1
‘ @entity154 was difficult ; i became very sick and fragile and a month later , i had no hair			0
‘ i have been a @entity156 for years and this really challenged my faith			2
i questioned how a caring @entity159 could do this to me			0
this time was hard for those closest to me too , but they helped me pull through			0
i kept my brave face on to please everyone around me			0
‘ one thing that really helped was having my chemo at the @entity62 unit at @entity168 , where everyone is aged between 16 and 24			0
@entity7 has now finished her treatment and is in remission			1
‘ i am so pleased the treatment is over but i ’m experiencing effects of the chemo now such as bowel problems			0
’ she firmly believes that had she been older , her symptoms would have been taken more seriously			1
‘ there ’s no doubt in my mind that an older woman would have been tested for cancer			2
‘ i even remember my doctor saying i was too young to have it			0
i ’ve met other people through the @entity62 who were told the same thing			0
indeed , a report released by the @entity62 this week shows that over a third of young people with cancer ( 37 per cent ) are diagnosed through admission to accident and emergency			1
this is nearly three times the number of adults diagnosed in this way			0
of these young people , over a quarter ( 26 per cent ) had already been to see their gp with cancer symptoms			1
the report also highlights that diagnosis through @entity201 is associated with poorer outcomes and care			2
@entity7 is now back at university studying business and trying to get on with life			2
she is also passionate about raising awareness of teenage cancer symptoms			2
( pictured with @entity209 , @entity210 health secretary ) the five most common signs of cancer in young people aged 13 to 24 are persistent and unexplained : pain lump , bump or swelling significant weight loss extreme tiredness changes in a mole around seven young people aged 13 to 24 are diagnosed with cancer every day in the @entity222 and more young people die as a result than any other disease			1
while it is accepted that early diagnosis leads to better outcomes in adults , cancer in young people is harder to diagnose because the signs are so similar to other less harmful problems			0
this means young people with cancer are frequently misdiagnosed with issues like infections , sports injuries and exam stress			1

she is also passionate about raising awareness of teenage cancer symptoms			2
‘ i want to stress to other people my age not to dismiss persistent symptoms			1
keep going back until someone takes you seriously			0

@entity7 had extreme tiredness and constant pain in her left side
but her symptoms were constantly dismissed *due* to her age , she believes
was eventually diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer
surgeons had to remove her ovaries , fallopian tubes and appendix
this meant she went through the menopause at just 19 years old
one in three teenagers are diagnosed with cancer in @entity201 and , like @entity7 , their symptoms are written off as stress , tiredness or sports injuries
