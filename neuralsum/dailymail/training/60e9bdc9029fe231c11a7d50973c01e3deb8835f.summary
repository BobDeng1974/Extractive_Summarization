@entity1 ’s governing body , the @entity0 , have confirmed that @entity2 will not face a sanction for his crash with @entity5 in sunday ’s @entity6			1
although @entity5 claimed that @entity2 told him in a post-race meeting that he ‘ deliberately ’ orchestrated the second - lap collision , @entity8 ’ director @entity7 tried to play down the accusation afterwards			1
@entity2 , too , said it was a ‘ racing incident ’			2
in light of the evidence , @entity0 spokesman @entity14 told @entity17 : ‘ the @entity0 will not intervene in this issue			1
only a " new element " that would have appeared after the results became final could justify us opening an investigation			0
a comment alleged to have been made in an internal briefing and later denied by the team itself does not constitute such a " new element "			0
’ winging it : a piece of wing soars over @entity2 's car after the collision , which @entity5 says was deliberate close call : @entity8 team - mates @entity2 and @entity5 have differing views on the collision at @entity37 with the @entity0 not prepared to investigate the incident , @entity2 will remain 29 points clear of @entity5 , who ultimately retired from the race as a result of the smash that initially punctured his tyre , while his @entity8 team - mate , @entity2 , came second behind @entity46 ’s @entity45			1
@entity7 was keen to distance himself from an initial briefing from within @entity8 that @entity5 ’s recollection of his meeting with @entity2 was ‘ broadly correct ’			2
@entity7 said : ‘ they agreed to disagree in a very heated discussion , but it was n’t deliberately crashing			0
‘ @entity2 felt he needed to hold his line			2
he needed to make a point			0
he thought it was for @entity5 to leave him space , and that @entity5 did n’t leave him space			0
‘ it was deliberately taking into account that if @entity5 moved it could end up in a crash			0
