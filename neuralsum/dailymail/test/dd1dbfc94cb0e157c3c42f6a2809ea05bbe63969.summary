they are one of the most feared animals on the planet			0
now fascinating images reveal how fish make a collective effort to stay out of the way of sharks			1
the striking photographs show a shoal of fish making way for the blacktip shark swimming in the shallow waters of @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
incredible images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark ( pictured ) , perhaps proving that they are instinctively frightened of it it is thought that the reef shark was not interested in catching a meal , but the fish naturally keep their distance , creating circles of clear water around the predator			1
dr @entity32 , senior research fellow and diving officer at the @entity34 , told @entity35 : ' this is fairly typical behaviour for shoaling fish , the same would happen if it were a diver in the photograph rather than a shark			2
' something big is automatically accepted as a potential threat and swimming in a swirling dense shoal is a defensive move which provides mutual protection simply reducing the chances of an individual being picked off and confusing the potential “ enemy "			0
' flocks of small birds will react the same way to hawks			0
' fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour , such as keeping safe from predators as well as boosting their chances of feeding and finding a mate			1
it ’s known that shoals of fish can change shapes and directions in seconds - as if they are thinking as one - and in these images , the fish manage to keep a pocket of clear water between themselves and the shark , even the pocket does change shape			1
software engineer @entity74 was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the shark			1
the photos show a shark swimming in the shallow waters , where they are guaranteed a clear path because ‘ terrified ’ fish move out of their way software engineer @entity74 was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across fish trying to avoid the shark off @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 ( marked ) it ’s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators ’ jaws , because they confuse larger creatures			1
the ‘ predator confusion effect ’ is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because similar - looking fish create a sensory overload for predators			1
fin movements made by a shoal seem to overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal , perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking			0
the fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way			1
the look - out is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group			2
luckily , the 32 - year - old was carrying his camera to snap the scene			0
‘ there were four blacktip reef sharks circling the area and there was one other type of shark - a lemon shark , ’ he said			1
‘ we walked along the jetty looking down at a large school of fish just beneath the jetty			2
‘ we noticed a number of reef sharks patrolling the area near the jetty and as we watched the reef sharks slowly moved into the school of fish , with the fish retreating away from the immediate area around the shark			1
‘ this progressed for about 15 to 20 minutes and a lemon shark joined in on the action late in the piece			0
‘ it seems like the fish are well aware of the threat and are trying to keep a safer distance from it			2
they want to avoid being eaten ! ’ he noted that the sharks were ‘ remarkably calm ’ when moving though the fish			0
‘ it was certainly not what i would describe as a feeding frenzy at the time			0
‘ there was an occasional swift manoeuvre to attempt to catch a fish and the sharks were successful in some of these attempts			0
he added : ‘ watching the continuous parting of the school of fish as each shark moved through the mass of fish was absolutely spectacular ! ’ whether fish feel fear ( illustrated by a still from the film @entity176 ' is a slippery question for scientists			2
some studies claim that fish feel pain , but shoaling behaviour 's thought to be purely instinctive software engineer @entity74 was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the sharks ( pictured left and right ) near a jetty whether fish have emotions , is a slippery question for scientists , whose studies have shown that they can feel pain in an abstract way , as well as other emotions			1
whether fish feel fear , or simply act instinctively , they swim in large shoals that offer individuals more protection from predators than going it alone			1
shifts in the shape of the shoal is thought to be driven by feeding , travelling and avoiding predators			2
it ’s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators ’ jaws , because they confuse larger creatures			1
proposed in 1978 , the ‘ predator confusion effect ’ is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predator 's visual channel – a theory that ’s been proved in the wild and in computer simulations			0
there is also a theory that fin movements made by a shoal overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal , perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking			0
it ’s possible that if one shark was found among the shoal ( pictured ) and others around it , they could act collectively to corral a shoal for a quick meal			2

this behaviour is n’t common in sharks , but dolphins have been shown to surround and herd fish as a group , while individuals take it in turns to swim through the shoal , eating unlucky members			0
corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured and @entity278 bottlenose dolphins even chase fish onto mud banks for an easy meal			0
in the shark world , @entity283 sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fish			0
before striking they confine lots of fish in a small space by swimming round them , and then splash then strike them with the upper lobe of the tail to stun them .			0

photographs show reef shark passing though a shoal in @entity15
images were captured by a groom - to - be ahead of his wedding
they show fish keeping their distance , perhaps proving they are scared
shoals keep fish safe in large numbers because they confuse predators
