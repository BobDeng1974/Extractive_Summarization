' i am very surprised by the acceptance of this photographic series , ' said mr @entity18 , who also works as a conceptual designer for films by acclaimed directors like @entity63 and @entity64			1

artist : @entity79 @entity78 said the project ' seems to generate some curiosity in people ' super cool : a pug is given a hip - hop makeover and a wolf is dressed in a dinner jacket and bow tie collection : the @entity91 artwork that features an otter and a mink is half photograph , half illustration layered look : as if he were not furry enough this panda and polar bear have been given scarves looking good : the red squirrel and giraffe are some of the only animals to be dressed in women 's clothes characters : the bear looks even more cuddly in a woolly jumper but the bull looks mean in the puffer jacket the work , which is half photograph and half illustration , is still developing and he continues to produce more animals			1
these include a giraffe wearing a roll - neck jumper , an ostrich with a bowler hat and a fox dressed like a tv detective			0
so far his most cherished character is the macaque dressed in a suit and tie because of the colours and that primates ' look almost as if brushed with humanity '			0

' suited and booted : the sloth looks like it is ready for a night on the town , while the dog seems to need a nap dressed down : the tiger and the pig have gone for the casual look in simple shirts @entity144 shot : the lemur and fox look like they could be posing as gangsters in their smart outfits bizarre : the frog is dressed in a jumper and a rhino wears a leather biker jacket			0
