by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 18:15 est , 25 august 2013 when they opened a tea shop in a wealthy village , the owners expected to play host to nothing more than the well - to - do locals and a few tourists			1
so imagine their shock when they arrived at work one morning to find a swarm of cockroaches scuttling round the shop			1
around 50 of the bright red insects had been posted through the letter box overnight			1
shocked : @entity15 and @entity16 at their tea shop in @entity19 , @entity20 , were shocked at the attack they are believed to have been the @entity24 hissing variety , which can grow to three inches long and move very fast			1
the attack happened less than two weeks after business partners @entity16 and @entity15 opened the @entity28 tea shop in @entity19 , on the banks of the @entity30 in @entity20			1
the pair have no idea who is to blame , but one line of inquiry is that it could have been a business rival			0
police have said that because of the close - knit nature of the community , they will gladly receive anonymous information about the crime , which led to the immediate temporary closure of the cafe for hygiene reasons			0
a pest controller was called and police have collected samples of the cockroaches in the hope that they can be traced to the perpetrator following scientific testing			0
in @entity52 they can be bought only from pet shops specialising in rare creatures because they have to be bred and kept in precise conditions			0
shocked : the attack happened less than two weeks after the business partners opened the tea shop mrs @entity16 , 43 , said of the attack : ‘ it ’s a disgusting thing to do , it ’s vicious			1
we are a brand new tea shop			1
for someone to do this is just vile			0
’ ' it ’s a disgusting thing to do , it ’s vicious			0
we are a brand new tea shop			1
for someone to do this is just vile ' @entity16 but she added that they have been ‘ overwhelmed ’ by support from the residents in @entity19			1
locals include @entity77 - winning rugby coach sir @entity76 , singer @entity78 and tv presenter @entity79			0
mrs @entity16 said : ‘ everybody has been knocking on the door and they are absolutely shocked by what has happened			2
’ @entity24 hissing cockroaches come from the south - east @entity86 island and are sold by specialist breeders for around £ 20 for a batch of 50			2
if one is disturbed or alarmed it makes an unpleasant hissing sound by breathing through an airhole			0
probe : police have said that because of the close - knit nature of the community , they will gladly receive anonymous information about the crime , which led to the immediate temporary closure of the cafe the cockroaches can climb surfaces including glass , making them extremely hard for exterminators to kill once there has been an infestation			0
although the tea shop had to close , it was open for business again the next day after receiving a clean bill of health			1
the @entity28 has opened next door to a delicatessen that serves coffees , and there is another tea and cake shop further down the high street			2
several pubs on the same road also serve cream teas , as do a few other cafes in the village			0
@entity19 is a popular base for picturesque walks by the @entity30			2
author @entity125 lived in the parish as a child and is said to have been inspired by the river to write @entity129			0
the artist sir @entity130 , who described @entity19 as a ‘ village in heaven ’ , lived and worked there , and several of his works hang in a gallery close to the @entity28 .			2

@entity16 and @entity15 opened tea shop in @entity19 , @entity20
