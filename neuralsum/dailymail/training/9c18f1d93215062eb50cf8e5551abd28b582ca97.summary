in the latest @entity15 , @entity2 , a 58 - year - old hailing from @entity14 , says that her humanitarian efforts to eradicate piracy in @entity7 have earned her a large fan base in the country			1
a senior @entity21 government official once even went on - the - record to say that @entity2 ‘ has more sway in @entity7 than the whole @entity23			1
’ @entity7 princess : @entity25 ( pictured above ) is said to have ' more sway in @entity7 than the whole @entity21 government ' she has now embarked on a new humanitarian venture with @entity7 ’s former president @entity29 to help provide housing for the country ’s large population of refugees			1
@entity2 says that she is known to negotiate with @entity7 ’s notorious pirates , and that she has had a ‘ behind the scenes ’ hand in organizing the release of pirate hostages			1
she also says that she has carried out peaceful conversations with all walks of @entity7 life as part of her work , including pirates and members of the @entity47 group , the terrorist organization responsible for last month ’s brutal attacks on a @entity51 mall			1
' when i was in the north ... there was close to 80,000 people trying to get to me			0
they call me the “ @entity57 " ' she says she is not afraid of these more feared sects of @entity7 society			2
‘ they would have a tsunami on their hands , ’ @entity2 said of what would happen if she were injured by a @entity7 fringe group			1
‘ when i was in the north at one point , there was close to 80,000 people trying to get to me			0
they call me the “ @entity57 ” … there would be terrible repercussions			0
’ but despite her pull within @entity7 society , @entity2 has apparently never worked for the @entity23			1
in 2007 , she sent an ‘ unsolicited letter ’ to the @entity73 offering her services in tracking down @entity76 networks in @entity77			0
the bureau sent her a letter back saying that they were ‘ not interested ’ in her services and did not authorize her to carry out her terrorist - finding mission on its behalf			0
friends in high places : @entity25 sits with business partner and former @entity7 president @entity29 but @entity2 was undeterred			1
according to the paper , she sought solace at the @entity88 the following year — an effort that was rewarded with a classified contract for an undisclosed amount of money			0
within a year , the contract was reportedly terminated for ‘ nonperformance			0
’ @entity94 , who has worked with @entity2 , told the @entity15 : ‘ she has an amazing ability to attract very powerful people			2
then it all falls apart			0
’ ‘ i was known as the @entity98 in the children ’s industry ’ @entity2 had many careers before focusing her attentions on @entity7 , the paper says			1
in 1986 she ran for @entity104 and lost , a defeat that prompted her to design children ’s clothes , which she says were sold in @entity108			1
‘ i was known as the @entity98 in the children ’s industry , ’ she said of her design career			1
( @entity2 is also a fashion plate who is cited as wearing @entity114 and @entity115 clothing in the piece ) @entity2 ’s childrenswear business closed following her first marriage ( to a man 35 years her senior )			1

her luck changed with her second marriage to @entity126 , a longtime maître d ’ at @entity129 ’s famous @entity128			0
the couple relocated to the @entity132 metro area after their wedding , where @entity126 worked in a similar capacity at the @entity136 , while @entity2 dabbled in investment banking			2
coastal storm : @entity2 says that she has had a hand in negotiating the release of @entity7 pirate hostages her foray into finance gave @entity2 access to a vast array of wealthy people			1
by enlisting what seems to be an acute knack for sociability , she quickly cemented her status as a gala circuit - ing businesswoman on the @entity132 scene			0
that positioning gave her access to an encounter with an ‘ elder @entity157 sheik ’ from @entity7 ’s prevailing religion			2
@entity2 became fascinated with the @entity157 religion , as well as @entity7 culture as a whole			1
she soon began making goodwill trips to the country and amassed a following of @entity7 constituents who nicknamed her their princess			2
her sage @entity7 influence spread , and in 2009 then - president @entity29 named her his ‘ presidential advisor for @entity170			2
’ the appointment came at the heat of @entity7 ’s pirating crisis			2
in fact , @entity2 has already been involved in several @entity7 development programs that did not work out			1
her nation - building program , dubbed the ‘ organic solution ’ , included plans for everything from banks to commercial airlines			0
the project dissolved after nine months , with many of its investors failing to recoup tens of thousands of dollars , the @entity15 reports			0
another @entity187 company titled @entity188 similarly never got off the ground			0
brick and mortar : @entity2 has now embarked on a new project with president @entity29 , building tiny modular homes ( in the foreground , above ) for @entity7 refugees but @entity2 -- who provided multiple photo albums to the @entity15 writer as proof of her popularity in @entity7 in which she was seen ‘ posing with @entity7 politicians , warlords , clan leaders , and @entity202 , ’ -- has now teamed up with former president @entity29 again			1
' the problem with @entity2 is separating fact from fiction			2
what is real , and what is made up ? ' they have begun work on a housing project for @entity7 refugees called the ‘ @entity212 ’			2
@entity2 and @entity29 have already created a modular demo with the help of pro-bono contractors , as was the case with many of her former business ventures			0
