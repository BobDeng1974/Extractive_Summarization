there is a delicious type of miniature pancake , the recipe for which dates back to the 16th century , that tourists are offered in the @entity6			2
they are called poffertjes and are quite unlike our thin , abstemious @entity9 tuesday version			2
looking like puffed - up feather pillows , they are dusted with sugar , glazed with melted butter and drizzled with syrup			1
on particularly cold days , a measure of brandy might find its way into the batter			2
these culinary delights were undoubtedly much loved by those generously proportioned women painted by the great @entity23 artist @entity22 — with their creased and creamy flesh , bosoms pulled in and pushed up by corsets , their plump elbows and , above all , their soft , eiderdown bottoms			1
the fact is that @entity22 was not rebelling against a 17th - century @entity31 ideal to champion the ‘ larger lady ’			1
back then , there was no size six ideal ; pictured above is his work , @entity37 at the @entity38 indeed , the word ‘ @entity22 ’ has come to be used to describe any woman of a certain size and softness			1
the comedian @entity43 has , self - deprecatingly , joked : ‘ if i had been around when @entity22 was painting , i would have been revered as a fabulous model			1
@entity46 ? she ’d have been the paintbrush			2
’ it ’s a good line , but it is to misunderstand @entity22 if he is seen today as a man who encouraged women to embrace their curves , learn to love their jiggly bits and never say no to a second poffertje			1
the fact is that @entity22 was not rebelling against a 17th - century @entity31 ideal to champion the ‘ larger lady ’			1
back then , there was no size six ideal			1
what @entity22 revelled in was sheer abundance			1
he was attracted by wealth , titles , courtly grace , sumptuous fabrics , bounty , beauty , palaces , friends in high places , travel , fountains , sweeping lawns , manicured gardens and banqueting houses			2
as you can see at a new exhibition , @entity76 , at the @entity77 in @entity78 , his enthusiasm for delicious , wantonly plump female flesh was part of this taste for luxury and plenty			1
born in 1577 into an affluent , respected family — his father was a lawyer — and brought up in @entity87 , @entity22 was appointed a page to a noblewoman , @entity90 , @entity91 , after finishing his schooling			1
this early association with courtly manners helped to make him a hit with aristocratic and royal patrons after he trained as a painter			2
@entity22 , who served not only as a court painter but also as a diplomat , was dubbed ‘ the prince of painters and painter of princes ’ ; still , he is best remembered for his plump and inviting nudes his client list reads like a who ’s who of @entity109 society : counts , dukes and archdukes , earls and knights , @entity115 of @entity116 and our own @entity118 i. @entity22 , who served not only as a court painter but also as a diplomat , was dubbed ‘ the prince of painters and painter of princes ’			1
still , he is best remembered for his plump and inviting nudes			1
we can not blame the poffertjes alone , for the @entity129 at that time were truly a place of guzzling and gluttony			2
one historian remarked in 1665 that the land ‘ overflows with butter , cheese and milk ’			1
they were n’t the half of it			0
@entity143 arrived on ships from @entity145			0
traditional waffles and pancakes , once served plain , were now dusted with sugar and caramelised sauces			0
cakes and biscuits were studded with candied fruit , crystallised ginger or molasses			0
@entity157 tarts and rosewater flavoured marzipan were served on special occasions			0
honey cakes and caramel were daily treats			0
there were dessert creams made with milk , sugar , cinnamon , eggs , and apples			1
one chronicler lists 41 types of biscuit , from those made with aniseed to others baked with cherries			0
marrons glacés ( sugared chestnuts ) were imported from @entity179			0
whenever gluttons felt sated , they tucked into salads of imported fruits — the rich could afford pineapples , while middle - class burghers made do with melons , oranges and grapes			0
any pretence at virtue , however , was undone by a tendency to cover the grapes in treacle			0
@entity194 painting the @entity195 ; tooth decay was a terrible problem			0
the artist @entity198 , who saw the older @entity22 as his great rival , lost almost all his teeth in later life because of his weakness for sugar			1
there was even a word for it : lekkerheid — a craving for sweetness or tastiness			1
a typical day would begin with breakfast — the first of four meals — and it might include three types of bread ( a rye loaf , a wheaten one and a sweeter pastry baked with fruits and sugared spices ) and five types of cheese			2
two varieties of butter would be served along with fish , sliced and salted ox or pork , buttermilk , hot chocolate , tea , and the leftovers of the previous night ’s dinner			2
the wealthiest in society might have had a game or meat pie if they were still feeling peckish			0
in summer , cherries and berries would be eaten with sweet or sour cream			0
everyone drank beer at breakfast — it was thought the most wholesome drink for men , women and children and consumed in vast quantities throughout the day			0
lunch was a four - course affair			0
a soup to start , usually made from vegetables and bacon cooked in milk			2
for main , a meat or fish dish with salad or fruit to follow			0
then pudding proper : waffles , the inevitable pancakes or rice pudding			0
at 3pm there was bread , cheese , almonds , raisins , a selection of pastries , tea and hot or cold beer			2
dinner — even gourmands might begin to groan at this point — was much the same as lunch , with butter , bread , cheese , wine sweetened with cinnamon and sugar , and a milky porridge			1
one hugely popular dish , sometimes called olipotrigo but given different names across the @entity129 , was a hotpot made with slow - cooked capon , lamb , minced veal , rams ’ testicles , beef , calves ’ heads , coxcombs , sausage , marrowbone , artichokes , chicory , endive , asparagus and game birds , mixed with four or five egg yolks , wine , vinegar and melted butter , served with roasted chestnuts			2
is it any wonder the @entity309 botanist and parson @entity311 , who travelled in the @entity129 in the 17th century , wrote that men and women he encountered were ‘ almost always eating as they travel , whether by boat , coach or wagon ’ and that they were ‘ for the most part big - boned and gross - bodied ’ ? for his part , @entity22 looked on his countrywomen with a more sympathetic eye than @entity322			1
a note on the wall at the @entity77 exhibition reads : ‘ @entity22 enjoyed painting buxom nudes			1
’ this is extreme understatement			0
no artist painted poffertjes - plumped flesh with the sensuous joy of @entity22			1
in his double - portrait of the @entity333 and the chaste nymph @entity334 ( included in the exhibition ) , he paints an inch - wide crease above @entity334 ’s navel			0
just enough to be pinched between thumb and forefinger			0
you can see why the @entity342 might want to get his hands on this buttermilk - and - beer - fed maiden			0
@entity346 , @entity347 above ; @entity194 and his legacy is at the @entity77 from this saturday until april 10 the art historian @entity349 , presenter of the sweeping @entity351 series @entity352 , most elegantly took the measure of @entity22 when he wrote in his 1956 book the nude : ‘ why do we burn with indignation when we hear people who believe themselves to have good taste dismissing @entity22 as a painter of fat naked women , and even applying the epithet vulgar ? what is it , in addition to sheer pictorial skill , that makes his nudes noble and life - giving creations ? ’ his answer is simple : ‘ the golden hair and swelling bosoms of his graces are hymns of thanksgiving for abundance , and they are placed before us with the same unselfconscious piety as the sheaves of corn and piled - up pumpkins which decorate a village church at @entity382			1
’ ‘ hymns of thanksgiving for abundance ’ — that is what you must think when you see @entity22 ’ women with their dimpled thighs , the soft , soufflé folds of their stomachs and their yielding flesh			1
the last painting in the exhibition is @entity22 ’ @entity395			1
a doleful @entity37 sits hunched and hungry			0
her son , @entity396 , cowers with neither the will nor energy to pick up his bow and arrow to make his customary mischief			0
behind them , a satyr approaches , carrying a cornucopia of wheat and fruit			0
it was inspired by a line from the @entity409 playwright @entity408 : ‘ love withers without food and drink			0
’ you might say the same about @entity22 ’ voluptuous and unrepentantly indulgent art. * @entity76 is at the @entity77 from this saturday until april 10			1
