a @entity1 dad fed up with his daughter ’s preference for very short shorts decided to teach her a lesson by donning some @entity7 of his own			1
@entity8 was about to go on a family night out , but when he asked his daughter to kindly change into longer shorts and she refused , he took some scissors to an old pair of his own jeans			1
the result was a revealing pair of cut - offs designed to show his daughter her shorts are n’t ‘ as cute as she thinks			2
one of those guidelines happens to be no short - shorts			2
‘ i ’m a firm believer that the way we dress sends messages about us , and it influences the way we and others act , ’ he writes			2
every monday , the @entity42 do something together ‘ in an effort to try to spend time with just the family			2
’ last monday , they decided to go out to eat			0
are these the shorts ? @entity8 's daughter @entity51 , @entity52 the girl who would n't change her shorts , sports an edgy haircut @entity51 's dad is unhappy with her choice in shorts so he decided to subtly mock her with his own version of the @entity7 but as they were about to leave , @entity8 ’s teen daughter was resolute — she would not change out of her @entity60			1
at first , the kids had their heads buried in their phones , @entity8 said , and did n’t notice his revealing attire			1
‘ why are you dressed like that ? ’ his daughter eventually asked when they were nearly at the restaurant			0
‘ oh well , i do n’t care			0
’ dinner came and went without @entity8 ’s daughter breaking a sweat , so he decided to take things to the next level			1
family first : @entity8 and his wife @entity31 are pictured here			1
@entity31 published her husbands story of parental retribution on her personal blog ‘ ok , let ’s go miniature golfing , ’ he said			0
again , the daughter would n’t let her embarrassment show			0
then , when they arrived at a local ice cream shop , she cracked			0
‘ as i pulled into a stall , my daughter said , “ uh , no ! we are not going in ! ” i said “ @entity89 through the drive up			0
” ’ @entity8 , his wife , and their son went inside , but their daughter stayed in the car			1
he ’s not sure if the lesson sunk in , but @entity8 said he ’s comfortable with that			1
‘ there was no “ @entity100 i get it , ” ’ he said			0
‘ but no matter if social media gets the story mixed up and twisted , my daughter will always know that her dad loves her and cares about her enough to make a fool out of himself			0
