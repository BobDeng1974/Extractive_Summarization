as a frantic second half unfolded , @entity11 tried to take advantage of sin bin offences for @entity1 forwards @entity37 and @entity86			1
for a short period , @entity1 were reduced to 13 men and @entity11 engineered a try for captain @entity64 off a line - out drive			1
fly half @entity60 missed the conversion			2
@entity11 looked set to dominate only for @entity1 to increase their lead again , thanks to a second penalty from centre @entity28			1
@entity1 had played their best rugby in the first half and led from the 13th minute when @entity28 landed his first penalty goal			1
some excellent team play , including @entity1 ’s trademark forward drives , eventually cracked open the @entity5 defence in the 20th minute , full - back @entity30 speeding on to @entity28 ’s pass to score in the left corner			1
@entity28 missed the conversion but @entity1 ’s 8 - 0 lead proved significant as the match unfolded , @entity11 finding their rhythm			1
@entity1 spent the vast majority of the second half on the defence , successfully snuffing out repeated @entity5 attacks			1
close defeat : @entity64 goes over for a @entity5 try challenge : @entity5 's @entity120 runs into @entity1 's @entity28 centre @entity58 looked certain to score only for referee @entity122 to adjudge that the @entity5 player had been held up by @entity1 defenders			1
‘ it was the classic game of two halves , ’ smiled a relieved @entity1 coach @entity125 afterwards			1
‘ it ’s a cliché but true			2
‘ in the second half we just forget how to attack and decided to defend			2
we did manage to grab three points when we were down to 14 men and that proved crucial			2
overall , it was a good game and a credit to both teams			2
‘ @entity28 accepted the combined tackle by captain @entity138 and @entity30 on @entity58 had been a big turning point			2
‘ that was a great moment and epitomised our team and the way we play for each other , ’ he said			2

@entity146 led 10 - 0 early in the second half of a nervous contest and looked set to continue in the footsteps of the school ’s 2007 team who beat @entity211 in the final			0
but @entity171 ultimately proved stronger after overcoming a spate of handling errors which had ruined a number of attacks			0
@entity146 were 3 - 0 ahead at half - time , thanks to a penalty by full - back @entity147 , and extended the lead three minutes after the break when scrum - half @entity153 galloped clear off an interception near halfway			0
@entity147 converted to give @entity146 a 10 - 0 lead which was reduced by @entity178 ’s first penalty , the fly half having missed two kicks in the first half			0

‘ we were starting to think it was a ‘ bridge too far ’ but we had to get on that scoreboard			0
@entity146 are a good side but i never thought they were going to carve us up out wide			0
‘ we just needed to get some points in order to develop some confidence			0
we looked brilliant over on the back field in the warm up , but as soon as the opposition came on all that changed , ’ he joked			0
‘ but the way we fought back was testimony to this side ’s guts and determination			0
a @entity7 final is just fantastic			0
