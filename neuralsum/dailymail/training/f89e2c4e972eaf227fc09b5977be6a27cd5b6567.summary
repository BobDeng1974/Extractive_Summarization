@entity143 beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision			1
the radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy x-rays , used in conventional radiotherapy			0
unlike an x-ray , the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body			0
it enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely			2
the beam can be more finely controlled , in both its width and its depth , so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours , with less risk to healthy tissues			0
the treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours , including those found in the head and neck , eye , central nervous system , lung , prostate and gastrointestinal tract			0
the precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs , such as the eye , brain and spinal cord			2
source : @entity190 ‘ to know we can now fund the treatment without losing our home has taken one worry off our shoulders and means we can focus now on saving @entity5			1
‘ i ca n’t explain how emotional i feel as a result of the donations			0
' it ’s restored my faith in everything so on the one hand i feel like it ’s the happiest time of my life , but at the same time the very worst			0
‘ we feel so happy and buoyed by the love and support but on the other hand so sad and worried at the same time			0
' i never thought it would be possible to experience the best and worst moments of your life at the same time			0
’ though their house is currently still on the market , mrs @entity33 said they will no longer be selling it in the near future			2
she said : ‘ i just have n’t had time to take it off the market because this has all happened so fast			0
‘ but safe to say we wo n’t be homeless anytime soon now			0
i still ca n’t believe it			0
’ mrs @entity33 also issued her thanks to friends and family who have supported the family tirelessly since @entity5 was diagnosed in august this year			1
she said planned fundraising events would still go ahead			0
‘ there are still lots of unknowns in terms of the total cost of treatment and after care for @entity5 so we will keep the fund open , ' she said			2
doctors have told the family @entity5 may not live until @entity41			1
to apply for proton beam therapy on the @entity51 takes around eight weeks - time the youngster does n't have doctors misdiagnosed @entity239 's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer ' if we can get @entity5 into a clinic in @entity91 it might be that we can now relocate the whole family so we do n’t have to leave our other two children behind			1
we want to be together at a time like this			0
’ plans are underway to put the funds into a trust managed by directors			0
mrs @entity33 said she would also like to be able to help make the treatment more easily available for other children			0
she said : ‘ we are the lucky ones to have had such great help and support but there will be other families out there desperate to fund this treatment too and we feel strongly that it should be available in the @entity264			0
‘ the medical care @entity5 has received in hospital has been incredible			2
the doctors ands nurses who have taken care of her up until now are amazing			0
‘ but we are not a third world country so why is this treatment only available in @entity91 or @entity22 ? ' this is @entity274 , surely @entity264 patients should have access to the best treatments too ? ‘ we know this wo n’t change in time to help us but ultimately we hope we can help make a difference for other families who should n’t be worrying how to fund treatment at an already terrifying time			1

@entity5 was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in august
chemotherapy failed to work , her cancer tripled in size and spread to spine
doctors told her parents @entity9 and @entity295 beam therapy was the best hope for their seven - year - old daughter
they put their @entity18 home up for sale to try and raise £ *140,000* to pay for it
since friday strangers have donated a *staggering* £ 176,000 to help @entity5
the family will no longer have to sell their house and can afford treatment
but on friday an mri scan revealed @entity5 needs surgery this week and is too poorly to fly to an @entity22 clinic for treatment
her parents are organising for her to be seen at a clinic in @entity62 or @entity63 so they can drive @entity5 to see experts
@entity5 said : ' thank you everyone . i am feeling really happy now '
her mother added : ' we are overwhelmed , humbled and extremely grateful '
