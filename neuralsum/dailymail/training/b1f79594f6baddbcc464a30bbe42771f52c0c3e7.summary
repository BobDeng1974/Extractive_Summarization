unfairly accused ? @entity8 was arrested june 30 after leaving her 9 - year - old daughter at a playground while she worked her shift at @entity6 arrested : @entity8 was booked on unlawful child neglect charges and while she 's been freed on bond , her daughter was placed in state custody , where she remains that 's a good for @entity23 , since it 's been revealed the 46 - year - old is now out of a job and her daughter , now in state custody , is at present without a mother			1
on tuesday , @entity23 's attorney @entity37 told the @entity38 that @entity23 had been let go from her job , but that he did n't know why			1
' she is currently unemployed , ' he said			0
however , @entity43 's spokesperson @entity42 maintained that @entity23 's lack of a job was not the company 's doing			1
' it would not be appropriate to discuss an employment matter in the media , but i can confirm that this employee has not been terminated , ' @entity42 wrote in statement			0
while the reason behind her joblessness is unclear , @entity23 quite clearly needed the work enough to leave her daughter unattended in a playground			0
but many critics who initially judged her for her apparently heartless action have likely since given @entity23 the benefit of a doubt			0
one woman , a complete stranger to @entity23 , has become especially wrapped up in the working mom 's cause and started a fundraiser to support her with huge success			2
that woman , @entity68 , makes the case for supporting @entity23 on a @entity71 page she 's set up for that purpose			2
' it was very likely a choice that @entity8 would not have made were there other reasonable and affordable options available , ' @entity73 writes			0
@entity73 says @entity23 has been unfairly portrayed by some media outlets			0
' contrary to many reports , while the park would be more than a mile from @entity8 's workplace by car , it is only a few thousand feet - maybe a 5 minute walk - by foot , ' she writes			2
' the little girl was given a cell phone so she could call her mom at any time			2
' opposing views : a complete stranger has taken up @entity23 's cause with a fundraiser that has topped $ 30,000			1
that woman , @entity68 , says that while the playground is a mile from @entity23 's @entity6 by car , its is around 600 yards on foot @entity73 says @entity23 only chose to send her daughter to the playground after the laptop computer the 9 - year - old once played on in the restaurant while her mother worked was stolen from their home			1
@entity73 's @entity103 for @entity23 had already tripled its $ 10,000 goal			0
and with 21 days to go and support building for the mother , she and her daughter will likely get far more than $ 30,000			2
which is more than enough to get the little girl a new computer and into a good summer camp or day care			0
while @entity23 may have those blessings to look forward to , for now she remains out of jail on bond as she awaits trial , her daughter languishing in the state 's care			0
' taking her daughter away has also surely been a slap in the face to @entity8 , writes @entity73			0
' it sends a message that as a working mom , all her efforts are just not good enough			0
' ' currently unemployed ' : since @entity23 's june 30 arrest , she has reportedly cut ties with the @entity6 's location where she worked			1
the company says they did not fire her , while @entity23 's attorney said monday the 46 - year - old is ' currently unemployed '			1
