by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:45 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 18:23 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 , of @entity3 , learned his fate tuesday after admitting that he practiced @entity6 - style moves on 5 - year - old @entity7 while babysitting her in june			1
the toddler died from internal bleeding and lacerations to her liver after being body - slammed and elbowed in the chest about 20 times by her older half - brother , according to prosecutors			1
justice : @entity7 ' stepbrother @entity2 was sentenced to three years in a juvenile center for the june death of the 5 - year - old girl desvallons pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in november			1
he is expected to get psychological treatment and education programming while staying at the secure facility			0
he could be released earlier than three years depending on his progress			0
during his sentencing at @entity34 , members of the @entity31 where the @entity2 family worshiped described the 13 - year - old as a good kid and asked the judge to release him into their probationary custody			1
however , @entity2 's own stepfather , @entity40 , insisted that he was disrespectful and would repeat the actions that resulted in his sister ’s death given the chance			2
' i do n’t think you are going to give @entity2 license to go out there and kill somebody again , ' mr @entity45 , who was @entity46 's biological father , told the judge , according to @entity52			1
@entity53 , the boy 's mother , told judge @entity55 that little @entity46 was ' very special ' to her			2
' what he [ @entity2 ] did , it 's like he ended my life , ' mrs @entity23 told @entity55			2
' what the judge would decide , i would comply			0
' @entity6 also weighed in on the judge ’s decision , according to @entity62 , saying in a statement that the wrestling organization supports the ruling that @entity2 ‘ absolutely knew that he was hurting his 5 - year - old little sister			1
' ' therefore , it is illogical to conclude that the brutal and ultimately fatal beating of a 5 - year - old little girl by a teenager could be confused with imitation of @entity6 moves seen on tv			1
@entity45 died from the brutal beating june 16 in @entity3			1
@entity2 had originally been charged with manslaughter , but took a plea deal at the trial in @entity34 last month return for the less serious charge			1
tragic : @entity45 died from a brutal beating meted out to her by her step - brother , who pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent homicide last month the plea deal came after @entity88 deemed his interview with detectives after the death as inadmissible because neither he nor his mother , who attended , would have understood the legal obligations of what was happening			1
he wrote a statement in court confessing that he played with @entity97 ‘ in a bad way ’ and hit her on the back and stomach 15 to 20 times			0
he also admitted using ‘ body slams ’ that he ’d seen pro-wrestlers @entity104 and @entity106 perform			1
the little girl had suffered broken ribs , internal bleeding and a lacerated liver			1
the teenager told officers after his arrest that their mother was out of the house when the incident took place			0
paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she was pronounced dead a short time later			0
scene : the little girl suffered the beating in this @entity123 neighborhood while her half - brother babysat her @entity2 was arrested after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries two days after the death			2
her brother had initially told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to brush her teeth , and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor complaining her stomach still hurt , @entity130 's spokesman col. @entity129 said			0
the teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911 when he saw she was no longer breathing			0
dispatchers told him to start cpr and paramedics arrived on the scene			0
the coroner 's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of injury and her death was left as unclassified , but then @entity23 told detectives he had been practicing @entity6 - style moves on the girl , @entity62 reported earlier this year			2
hearing : the trial took place at @entity157 he said that even when his little half - sister said she was in pain , he continued to carry out the moves on her			0
detectives added that he appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault			0
the @entity164 reclassified her death as a homicide and @entity2 was arrested on suspicion of second - degree murder			2
violent : the boy said he used moves on his sister like those he had seen on @entity6			0

@entity2 , 13 , admitted using body slams he *'d* seen tv wrestlers @entity104 and @entity106 use
five - year - old @entity45 died of her injuries including broken ribs , internal bleeding and a lacerated liver
teenager accepted plea deal in may and may be free by the time he 's 16
