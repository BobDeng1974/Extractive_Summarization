there may yet be a presidential campaign in the future for former @entity4 governor and 2008 @entity6 vice presidential nominee @entity5			1
@entity5 said in an interview with @entity8 today that she is invigorated rather than discouraged by her critics , and they make her ' want to get out there and defend the innocent , want to work so hard for justice in this country			1
' ' so , hey the more they 're pouring on , the more i 'm going to bug the crap out of them by being out there with a voice , with the message , hopefully running for office in the future , too , ' @entity5 added			1
do n't put dirt on her grave just yet : former @entity4 gov. @entity5 said today she hopes to run for office again @entity5 built up goodwill among establishment republicans when she joined @entity27 sen. @entity26 for a pancake breakfast last month at the @entity29 and @entity30			1
if @entity5 runs for president in 2016 , she 'll need the support of moderate republicans like @entity26 to win the @entity6 nomination @entity5 decided not to seek the presidency in 2012 and she has n't held elected office since she resigned as governor in 2009 during her first and only term			1
she remains a fixture of the @entity40 , however , and is generally billed as the keynote speaker at influential conservative conferences			0
in march @entity5 told @entity43 that she did have a campaign apparatus set up for 2016 , but ' i 'll never say never			1
' if the @entity6 does n't produce a candidate who is a ' fighter ' and respects @entity47 exceptionalism , ' everything that makes @entity47 great , the promise of @entity47 then i would run , ' @entity5 said			2
' but i do think that there are so many @entity47 who feel like i feel , and they 're capable			2
they 're willing and able to serve			0
they are willing and able to serve and to lead this country so it does n't have to be me , ' she said back then			0
in her interview today , @entity5 said @entity6 leaders ' need more guts ' and have confidence in what the party stands for			1
she named sens. @entity63 of @entity64 and @entity65 of @entity66 as ' good leaders ' who do n't back down			0
@entity63 is a likely 2016 presidential candidate but he has not formally announced his intentions to form a presidential exploratory committee			0
given that neither @entity63 , nor any other presumed @entity6 candidates have announced yet , @entity5 still has time to decide if she wants to join the 2016 rodeo , as well			2
if she were to run she would surely have the backing @entity73 and hard right conservatives			0
she 's also built up some good will among establishment types by campaigning for embattled @entity27 sen. @entity26 last month			0
if @entity26 , who is disliked by many conservatives , loses his reelection bid , @entity78 may not take over the @entity81 .			0
