by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 going green : juice made from green algae and vegetables are all the rage they look as unappetising as many of them taste			1
but ever since the wheatgrass shot became a health - food phenomenon – the bitter juice is said to do everything from boosting the immune system to warding off cancer – manufacturers have been falling over themselves to create new concoctions of green sludge that promise astonishing benefits			1
surely , anything this disgusting must be good for us			1
but , what exactly does this stuff do ? @entity26 collectively as ‘ greens ’ , these supplements are derived from nutrient - packed plants and organisms , found in liquid , powder , pill or capsule form			1
they can be split into two categories			2
there are land - grown leaves and grasses , such as wheatgrass , barley - grass and kale , which are particularly rich in @entity41 , calcium , iron , magnesium and potassium			1
then there are algaes , such as spirulina , chlorella and kelp , which are high in good fats and protein , as well as magnesium and a host of vitamins and minerals			1
manufacturers and retailers say modern diets and intensive farming have left us deprived of essential nutrients – particularly magnesium found in chlorophyll – which are abundant in these supplements			1
magnesium is vital for maintaining healthy blood pressure and boosts the immune and digestive systems			1
good all - @entity69 therapist @entity68 says he takes a supplement combining several greens , and recommends them to his clients			1
‘ with so many foods available to us , we are very rarely deficient in essential nutrients , ’ he says			2
‘ but that ’s not to say that we could n’t benefit from a little more of this or that			0
i use it in place of multivitamins			0
' these “ edible pond scums ” are not chemical , and that means the body can absorb them more easily			0
they are good all - rounders and many of them contain probiotic bacteria			1
’ celebrity fans : both @entity90 and @entity91 enjoy green juices to keep themselves glowing a showbiz @entity93 who consume the supergreen stuff certainly look as if they enjoy glowing health – @entity90 , @entity97 and @entity91 are among fans			2
when model @entity101 tweeted a picture of herself drinking a juice cocktail containing chlorella earlier this year , sales of one brand rocketed by 60 per cent : @entity107 @entity106 claims it had to order an emergency shipment from @entity109 in order to keep up with @entity106 demand			0
in fact , chlorella is one of the most scientifically studied plant forms in the world , and has been hailed as a superfood since the 1940s when scientists believed it could be the high - yield , highly nutritious crop the world needed to feed the booming post-war population			2
popular plants : algae supplements such as spirulina , pictured , and chlorella are seeing a sales burst in the @entity106 it has been available in the @entity106 in tablet form for seven years , and in that time it has been reported that it reduces body - fat percentage and blood - glucose levels , helping those suffering from type 2 diabetes , heart disease or obesity			0
its energy - boosting , digestion - aiding qualities are among its other reported benefits , as is its ability to fight depression , reduce body odour and inhibit the body ’s absorption of harmful chemicals			0
@entity146 well spent ? centuries before @entity148 started taking spirulina , @entity150 living on the banks of @entity152 in @entity153 were reaping the benefits of this protein and chlorophyll - packed blue - green algae , which provides all the essential amino acids			1
the @entity158 were no strangers to the wonders of kelp for digestive troubles , and some of the oldest @entity165 herbal remedies were based on alfalfa			0
wheat and barley - grass supplements have never been more popular than in @entity169 in the 1930s , when the very first tablets hit the market			0
@entity173 , spokesman for the @entity174 and presenter of @entity177 ’s @entity176 , says : ‘ we ’ve known for a long time that they pack a punch in nutritional terms , and modern techniques mean they lose almost nothing when they are dried and turned into pills or powders			0
but more research is needed into their specific benefits before we can justify their cost			0
‘ @entity190 supplements are extremely expensive			0
their protein content is no better than that of milk or meat , but is about 30 times more expensive			2
' better sources of protein , as well as all the other vitamins and minerals they contain , can be found elsewhere at a far better price			2
' so if you ’re shopping for a supergreen supplement , i ’d advise you pick a mixed one , or , better yet , ask yourself whether your money would n’t be better spent in the fruit and veg aisle			0
