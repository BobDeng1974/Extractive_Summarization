taking in the country : the former president stopped to snap a picture of a bull with his camera phone nothing unusual : the powerful political couple seemed like normal tourists with the hoards of security guards being the only tip off of their position at one point , the former president stopped to take a picture of a bull who was behind a fence on the side of the road using the camera on his phone			0
