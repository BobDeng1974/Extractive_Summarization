the sun and moon have been gracing our skies for 4.5 billion years			2
it can be hard to imagine what another star would look in place of the sun , or how the night sky would appear with a planet instead of our satellite			0
now , the @entity12 has released an incredible animation of how it believes the planet ’s horizons will appear – and the results are stunning			2
it is the fourth brightest star in the sky , and is currently in the later stages of life			0
this is how it would appear on our horizon , filling up large parts of the sky the first animation reveals @entity32 in various lights by placing a different stars at the heart of our solar system			1
the opening star , @entity39 , is the nearest visible sun to our own , and one of the brightest in the southern night sky			2
in reality , it is about 4.3 light - years away , nearly 300,000 times the distance from the @entity32 to the sun. if it replaced our sun , a double - star system would appear in our skies			1
along with its companion , @entity39 , it orbits a common centre of gravity every 80 years			0
@entity55 , the brightest star in @entity32 night sky is almost twice as big as the sun. it would be bathing us in a bright whitish - blue light the opening star , @entity39 , is the nearest visible sun to our own , and one of the brightest in the southern night sky			1
along with its companion , @entity39 , it orbits a common centre of gravity every 80 years the average distance between them is about 11 astronomical units ( @entity70 ) — about the same distance as the sun to @entity73			2
@entity55 meanwhile is the brightest star in the sky , and closes to @entity32 at 8.6 light years , with a mass double that of our sun. @entity55 in the constellation @entity80 the @entity81 and on planet ’s horizon would appear under a blue haze			1
the animation also reveals @entity18 filling @entity32 ’s skies			1
@entity18 , a red giant , looks orange to the eye			0
it is the fourth brightest star in the sky , and is currently in the later stages of life			0
@entity93 , meanwhile , is about the same size as our sun but brighter and hotter			0
the final star to be shown is @entity98 , also known as the @entity99			0
it is located on the handle tip of the @entity102			0
the @entity12 has also created a video of what @entity32 ’s skies would look like if the moon was replaced by @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity73 , @entity111 , and @entity32			1
it shows just how large some of the planets are , with @entity109 and @entity110 filling up most of the sky			1
this is how a sunset on @entity32 would look like if the sun were replaced with @entity18 , one of the brightest stars in our ' neigbourhood ' on the left is an image of what @entity108 would look like in our sky if it replaced the moon			1
the right image shows how @entity32 would appear the final star to be shown is @entity98			1
it is famous for holding nearly still in our sky while the entire northern sky moves around it because it ’s located at the north celestial pole moon : 1,080 miles ( 1,738km ) @entity108 : 2,111 miles ( 3,397km ) @entity107 : 3,761 miles ( 6,052km ) @entity111 ( equatorial ) : 15,701 miles ( 25,269km ) @entity73 ( equatorial ) : 15,882 miles ( 25,559km ) @entity110 ( equatorial , not including rings ) : 37,449 miles ( 60,268km ) @entity109 ( equatorial ) : 44,422 miles ( 71,490km ) with our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius , the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles ( 384,000km ) from @entity32			1
@entity108 , for instance , is about twice the size , with a radius of 1,080 miles ( 3,397km )			0
@entity73 is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles ( 25,559km ) in radius , while @entity109 completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km )			0
interestingly , some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with @entity32			2
@entity160 , for example , which orbits @entity110 at a distance of 235,000 miles ( 377,000km ) , would likely impact @entity32 if @entity110 were in place of the moon			2
another interesting effect would be the gravitational influence on @entity32 if the planets were placed that close			0
they could strip away our atmosphere and cause huge tides and volcanoes			0
if @entity109 were the planet in the moon 's position , it ’s likely @entity32 would not even survive intact , being close enough to possibly be ripped apart and form a ring around the gas giant			1
@entity160 which orbits @entity110 ( pictured ) at a distance of 235,000 miles ( 377,000km ) , would impact @entity32 if @entity110 were in place of the moon the @entity12 has also created a video of what @entity32 ’s skies would look like if the moon was replaced by @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity73 ( right ) , @entity111 ( left ) , and @entity32 the animation by the agency shows just how large some of the planets are , with @entity109 ( pictured ) and @entity110 filling up most of the sky @entity73 ( pictured ) is about 25 times larger than the moon at 15,882 miles ( 25,559km ) in radius , while @entity109 outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles ( 71,490km )			1

animation reveals how @entity32 might look like if @entity98 , @entity55 , and stars of @entity39 replaced our sun
another video shows @entity32 ’s skies if the moon was replaced by planets such as @entity106 @entity109 and @entity110
videos were created by the @entity12 to help people visualise the size of planets and stars
