by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:05 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 22:33 est , 21 december 2013 most brides dream of throwing a white wedding which will make other women green with envy			0
but one bride has instead painted herself and her husband - to - be green , for their fairy - tale wedding based on the film @entity10			1
@entity12 , 44 , and @entity13 , 39 , from @entity14 , @entity11 planned their rather unusual ceremony after eight years together			1
green with envy ? a couple dressed as @entity10 and @entity18 for their wedding in @entity20 , @entity11 happy couple : newlyweds @entity13 and @entity22 sign the register in full costume themed : the couple 's guests were also encouraged to dress up for their big day , held at @entity27 , @entity20 after losing a number of friends to cancer , the couple decided to dress as the fairytale couple and use the day to raise money for charity			1
dressed in full costume , the pair wed this morning at @entity27 near @entity20			2
guests also dressed up for the themed celebrations - dressing up as the @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 from @entity42			1
cause : having lost a number of friends to cancer , the couple decided to have a themed wedding in aid of charity group photo : the couple 's guests donated money to charity rather than giving the pair a wedding present instead of wedding gifts , the couple - who run an ironing service business , asked that people donate money to @entity60			1
mr @entity13 said : ' in the last 15 months we 've lost seven of our customers to cancer			2
' it just broke our hearts			0
we wanted to do something to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage more people to go and get checked out			0
' vows : the couple - pictured just after the ceremony - always joked they would have a ' fairytale wedding ' the former bricklayer said the couple used to joke that if they ever got married , they would have a fairytale wedding			1
' it was a standing joke between us			0
all our friends started getting married and i said " when we do it we 'll have a fairytale wedding			0
i 'll be shrek and you can be @entity18 "			2
' earlier this year we held a fundraiser for @entity60 and we were talking about what else we could do when @entity10 came on the tv			1
we turned to each other and laughed			0
' inspiration : the pair decided to make their wedding @entity92 when the film came on the television fancy dress : guests came as a selection of characters - including mr @entity100 , pirates and mini mouse ' i do ' : one guest throws confetti while @entity106 , @entity107 and a gingerbread man watch on plans got under way for the fairytale wedding but the couple were then hit with more bad news			1
' my sister @entity114 was diagnosed with breast cancer			0
it was such a shock			0
' we were trying to do something to help others and then it happened to us			0
' in the spirit : one guest came as @entity122 from the film while another came as a monk family : @entity13 's sister was recently diagnosed with breast cancer - but was given the all - clear before the day luckily his sister has been given the all - clear but it made the couple even more determined to raise awareness of the disease			1
mr @entity13 said : ' we 've had a great day today and it 's fantastic to think the money raised will go towards helping to support those with cancer and their families			2
' also , if this story encourages just one person who has found a lump to go and get checked out then we will have succeeded			0
