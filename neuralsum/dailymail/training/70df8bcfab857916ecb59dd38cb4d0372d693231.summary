@entity1 users are being warned about a rise in so - called ‘ malicious tagging ’ scams designed to infect their phones , tablets and computers			1
over the past week , security researchers have spotted at least two ‘ tag campaigns ’ that were able to infect around 55,000 users a day			0
the scams work by tagging no more than 20 friends of the victim in a malicious post designed to lure the friends into clicking a link or watching a video			1
in a blog post , mr @entity28 said : ‘ the scam starts with an alleged video in which a number of friends are tagged in			2
' the number of tagged friends is always 20 but the alleged video is always different			1
' the scam starts with an alleged video that is posted with 20 friends tagged			1
the number of tagged friends is always 20 but the alleged video is always different			2
typically , the so - called video shows the goo.gl host underneath			0
this is a url shortening service and not a video hosting site			0
after a victim clicks on this particular link , they are prompted to update @entity47 , at which point the hacker can take control of a device and install other malicious files and viruses designed to steal personal information			1
once infected , the victim inadvertently posts the link to their own newsfeed , tagging another 20 people			1
users are being warned to be wary of clicking on links they are tagged in , and are encouraged to check with friends who have posted the link to check its safety			2

the scam works by tagging no more than 20 friends in a malicious post
this post is typically a video designed to lure the victim to click on it
number of tagged friends is always 20 and the video is always different
once a victim clicks on a link , they *'re* prompted to update @entity47
the virus then takes control of a device and installs other malicious files
once infected , the victim inadvertently posts the link to their own @entity1 feeds , tagging another 20 people
