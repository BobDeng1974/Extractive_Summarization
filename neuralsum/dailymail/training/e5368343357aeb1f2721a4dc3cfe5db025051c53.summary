by @entity0 published : 07:30 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 27 may 2013 a small @entity3 town that was once a pilgrimage site for @entity5 has been forced to recruit jobless workers from @entity7 to fill a labour shortage caused by its shrinking population			1
@entity12 , on @entity3 - @entity11 border , was best known as the burial place of @entity15 's deputy @entity14			1
his grave attracted neo-nazis who carried out annual marches in the town , which regularly conflicted with opposing anti-nazi marches			1
pilgrimage : the grave of @entity14 was a focal point for neo-nazis until marches were banned and his body exhumed and cremated although authorities banned the annual pilgrimage in 2005 , the town 's population has been diminishing , in part because of a slow birth rate			1
now companies have started recruiting from countries in southern @entity35 which have been hit hard by the economic crisis			0
already 12 @entity7 workers have been relocated after business owners from the town visited @entity40 in @entity7 , where unemployment is around 25 per cent			1
in contrast , fewer than 6 per cent of @entity12 's 9,500 inhabitants are unemployed			1
@entity44 , the owner of an electrical firm in @entity12 , went on the trip in march 2012 to find workers willing to relocate to @entity3			1
@entity15 's deputy : @entity14 was buried in @entity12 after he died in a @entity50 prison in 1987 where he had served a life sentence for war crimes he needed more trained electricians than he could find at home but he did not expect the overwhelming response he got from the unemployed in the @entity7 town of @entity57			1
' we went to @entity7 with a queasy feeling , ' said mr @entity44			2
' nobody had any kind of experiences with such a project , whether it could be successful or not			0
' but more than 200 people desperate to find work gathered in @entity57 's town hall and each vacancy received several applications			2
the plan to recruit workers in crisis - hit @entity7 was hatched by @entity71 , @entity12 's deputy mayor after he remembered an incident about 30 years ago when ' guest workers ' from @entity40 filled a labour shortage in the local ceramic industry			1
he said the recent scheme had gone well and that 10 of the 12 @entity7 were still in the town			1
' the road was not straight , but our experiment is successful , ' he said			0
local authorities bought and renovated a house for the @entity7 workers to live in , and even put their names on the doors to ' make them feel welcome '			2
@entity7 worker @entity87 had spent months looking for work in his home country before he took up the offer to move to @entity12			1
he said : ' this project was introduced to me , and it seemed interesting because it is a way of learning another language , another culture and another way of working			0
' and now i 'm here			0
i am very happy , and happy to get to know other people , another way of working , and at the moment i like it			0
' back home in @entity7 , his mother @entity103 said : ' a few years ago nobody imagined this could happen because the country was alright , there was work for everybody			2
struggle : in crisis - hit @entity40 the unemployment rate is around 25 per cent ' ours is a beautiful country , a cheerful country , where everybody would love to have a job to earn a living			0
but if that 's not what happens , then we have to go and look wherever jobs are , that 's normal			2
' some townspeople have objected to foreign workers being brought in when there are still some unemployed @entity3 in the area , but company bosses insist they can not find skilled workers locally			0
@entity128 died in a @entity50 prison in 1987 after served a life sentence for war crimes handed down at the @entity133 tribunal			0
he was buried in the town where his family had been on regular holidays at his own request			0
marches and demonstrations around the anniversary of his death on august 17 were a regular occurrence in the town until a crackdown by authorities in 2005			0
finally , in 2011 , @entity14 's remains were exhumed , cremated and scattered at sea .			0

@entity12 attracted *hoards* of neo-nazis visiting grave of @entity15 's deputy
now town has had to *fly* in workers from @entity7 as population diminishes
