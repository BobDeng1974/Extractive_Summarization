some tawdry late - night show on a subscription porn channel ? no. this was daytime on @entity9 yesterday			2
within minutes many were expressing their disbelief on @entity28 , pointing out that the live show is broadcast at a time when many young children may be watching			2
they described the programme ’s content as pornographic and ‘ ridiculously inappropriate ’ for daytime tv			2
the ‘ bondage for beginners ’ session was aired ahead of @entity40 and inspired by the new film of the controversial erotic novel @entity16 , which opens in cinemas next week			1
presenters @entity45 and @entity20 giggled their way through the show , which also featured a discussion about sex toys			1
@entity20 , 52 , had warned viewers shortly after 10.30am that they would be discussing bondage equipment in three stages – beginners , intermediate and advanced – throughout the show with ‘ sexpert ’ @entity56			1
however he assured them it would ‘ be done in good taste ’			2
backlash : viewers took to @entity28 to vent their disgust at the bondage for @entity64 segment angry viewers have taken to social media to air their disgust the demonstration of sex toys created a @entity28 backlash one viewer described the segment as ' sickening ' yet at one point @entity20 was so distracted by the romping models that he missed his cue to introduce the next section , while @entity76 , 36 , found herself laughing uncontrollably			1
media watchdog @entity77 said afterwards that it had received 50 complaints and was assessing whether to start an investigation			1
campaigners said it was an error of judgment to air the discussion at that time of day			0
@entity84 , director of @entity85 , said the show had set a dangerous example : ‘ it ’s not enough to say most children will be at school [ at that time ] because that ’s just not good enough			0
‘ quite apart from issues of taste and the fact that people might not want to speak to their children about this , i think it is dangerous to normalise this kind of behaviour			0
[ @entity16 ] is putting across ideas that humiliation is pleasurable and torture is gratifying and i do n’t think those are healthy for anybody at all			1
' but if it is dangerous for adults then it is doubly dangerous for children watching this			0
' @entity110 , who appeared on this morning during the daytime tv show 's segment called ' bondage for @entity64 ' the usually poised @entity45 also lost her composure and covered her mouth in embarrassment in bad taste ? the models demonstrate the feather tickler in today 's bondage segment on this morning posing on the silk sheets , the models seemed to be having a fantastic time , but were distinctly less comfortable with the steamy demonstration			1
‘ if they were n’t already under enough pressure in our incredibly sexualised society , they are being told that this sort of thing is great and this is how you should enjoy yourself			0
what an incredibly dangerous thing for a child to pick up on			0
