by @entity0 climate change is already having an impact on every part of the @entity4 , according to a doom - laden report published by the @entity7 administration			1
the third @entity4 national climate assessment , released today , says the number and strength of extreme weather events have increased over the past 50 years			1
the report is expected to guide the actions of president @entity7 , who has indicated he aims to make the issue a defining part of his last two years in office			1
scroll down for @entity17 the @entity4 national climate assessment says that climate change is already having an effect on every part of the @entity4			1
this map shows percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events from 1958 to 2012 for each region of the continental @entity4 his influence will be vital in creating a successor to the @entity29 next year , when the @entity30 aims to set legally binding targets for every country to reduce carbon emissions at a summit in @entity35			1
president @entity7 is set to use the paper to convince the @entity4 public on the need for a crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions			1
the report , compiled by 300 experts and released by the @entity44 , said : ‘ climate change , once considered an issue for a distant future , has moved firmly into the present			1
‘ corn producers in @entity50 , oyster growers in @entity52 , and maple syrup producers in @entity54 are all observing climate - related changes that are outside of recent experience			2
’ more than half the @entity4 population lives in coastal areas that are ‘ increasingly vulnerable ’ to the effects of climate change , the report said			1
and efforts to cut emissions so far are ‘ insufficient to avoid increasingly negative social , environmental , and economic consequences ’ , it concluded			2

global warming is rapidly turning @entity4 the beautiful into @entity4 the stormy , sneezy and dangerous , according to a new federal scientific report this graph shows observed global average changes ( black line ) in the climate , model simulations using only changes in natural factors like solar and volcanic ( green ) and model simulations with the addition of human - induced emissions ( blue )			1
such changes since 1950 can not be explained by natural factors or variability and can only be explained by human factors , says the report the 800 - page report says the consequences of climate change are hitting on several fronts , including health , infrastructure , water supply , agriculture and especially in more frequent severe weather such as floods and droughts			1
it added : ‘ global climate change is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond , but there is still time to act to limit the amount of change and the extent of damaging impacts			2
’ @entity109 , an adviser to president @entity7 , said the report includes ‘ a huge amount of practical , usable knowledge that state and local decision - makers can take advantage of as they plan on or for the impacts of climate change and work to make their communities more resilient ’			1
he added : ‘ this assessment is about presenting actionable science			2
’ @entity122 , executive director of the @entity123 of @entity124 , said : ‘ you really ca n’t just provide a report that paints this dark picture of all these impacts			2
‘ you have to couple it with a message of what our government can do about it , what you can do about it and what our communities can do			0

climate change 's assorted harms are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond , the @entity145 concluded tuesday the report echoes the message of the @entity30 ’s @entity151 , which last month published the final part in a trilogy of reports into the science , impact and solutions to global warming			1
the first part , published last september , found that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘ dominant cause ’ of global warming			0
the second part , published in march , warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘ already occurring on all continents and across the oceans ’			0
the final part , published in april on the options for mitigating global warming , warned that a rapid shift to wind and solar power is needed before 2030			0
an enormous region of @entity177 is far more vulnerable to thaw that previously thought , according to a new study published today in the journal @entity181			0
researchers of the @entity183 claim that global warming could trigger an unstoppable slide of ice into the ocean and raise world sea levels for thousands of years			0
the @entity189 in @entity177 , stretching more than 600 miles ( 1,000 km ) inland , has enough ice to raise world sea levels by 10 to 13 feet ( three to four metres )			0
the @entity192 is vulnerable because it is held in place by a small rim of ice , resting on bedrock below sea level by the coast of the frozen continent			0
that ' ice plug ' might melt away in coming centuries if ocean waters warm up			0
' @entity177 's @entity189 is like a bottle on a slant			0
once uncorked , it empties out , ' @entity205 of the @entity183 , lead author of the study in the journal @entity181 , said in a statement .			0

the third @entity4 national climate assessment warns of *worsening* weather
the report was compiled by 300 experts and released by the @entity44
@entity7 will use the paper to convince the public to reduce emissions
the 800 - page report echoes the message of the @entity30 's @entity151
they both say humans need to reduce their impact on the climate or face *catastrophic* consequences
