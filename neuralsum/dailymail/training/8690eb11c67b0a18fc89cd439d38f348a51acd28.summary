by @entity0 published : 18:17 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 18:17 est , 25 november 2013 they may have enchanted generations of young readers , but it seems some of our greatest children ’s classics would be better off ranked in the library ’s thriller section instead			0
a new list of the scariest kids ’ books of all time has celebrated tales such as @entity15 and @entity16 for their spine - tingling qualities rather than their ability to warm young hearts			1
according to writer and presenter @entity22 , who compiled it for the @entity24 , the well - known stories appeal to children precisely because they hint at the world ’s hidden darkness			1
@entity22 has complied a list of the scariest children 's books , naming @entity15 at the top			1
in the original the nanny uses her powers to bring joy , but also to inflict sinister punishments on the children she said : ‘ there is something i have never forgotten about children : that they sense darkness			2
however much you protect them ( and i had a pretty protected childhood ) , they know the world is jagged and shadowy			0
‘ seeing this reflected in stories , transformed into magical versions through which they glimpse an underlying truth , they are captivated			0
@entity15 , by @entity54 said : ‘ the @entity15 series of novels , by @entity57 , is filled with such sinister imagery			1
there is the character of mrs @entity61 , for example , who mentally abuses her troubled daughters and eats her own fingers			0
@entity67 , by the @entity66 said : ‘ these are shockingly dark for anyone familiar with the happy - ending @entity71 versions			2
the @entity72 , by @entity73 said : ‘ @entity75 ’s stories ( also including @entity76 and five children and it ) always involve children separated from their parents , never quite understanding why			0
@entity16 , by @entity80 said : ‘ probably the most heartbreakingly nostalgic novel ever written , for children or adults			1
@entity84 , the @entity85 and the @entity86 said : ‘ a religious allegory , the death of @entity89 is told in a country of snow , lions , @entity94 children and poisoned @entity96 delight			0
’ mrs @entity22 – who married comedian @entity97 last year – topped her list with the original @entity15 series , the first of which was written by @entity57 in 1934			1
she contrasted the darker tone of the books with the 1964 film adaptation , starring @entity105			0
she said : ‘ @entity105 ’ @entity15 is a beautiful , smiling , singing - and - dancing miracle of a person ; starchy , but essentially sweet - natured			2
the @entity15 of the books is a far darker character			1
‘ she is prim , vain , chilly and full of unpredictable anger			0
she snaps and threatens ; she uses her magic to create wondrous scenes , but also to mete out bleak and sinister punishments			0
’ the 41 - year - old singled out one @entity15 tale – in which one of the children is transported into the picture on a china bowl and told she can never escape – for particular praise			1
she said : ‘ in the 25 years since i first read that story , i have never read or seen another that has chilled me as much … @entity71 clearly felt that this darkness , sadness and horror would not play well to a cinema audience			0
' for the screen version it is wiped clean , replaced with flying kites and cartoon penguins			0
’ suggesting children are secretly fascinated with death , mrs @entity22 added : ‘ her dark punishments are about danger and injustice : things that children sense deeply , even before they understand them			1
’ perhaps a more obvious candidate for her list , her second choice was @entity67 , first published by the @entity147 grimm brothers in 1812 @entity149 's @entity148 ( left ) also made the list , as did @entity67 by the @entity151 ( right ) which @entity97 says are ' shockingly dark for anyone familiar with the @entity71 versions ' she said the classic stories – which include versions of the @entity157 and @entity158 – were depict ‘ the sadness and inevitability of growing up ’ , adding : ‘ filled with lonely children and wicked stepmothers ( thought by psychoanalytic critics to represent little girls ’ fears of alienation from their mothers ) , these are shockingly dark for anyone familiar with the happy - ending @entity71 versions ’			1
the final three books on the list were 1904 classic @entity172 , by @entity75 , @entity16 , by @entity173 , and @entity148 , by @entity149			1
@entity16 – which recounts the tale of a horse that is cruelly mistreated by a series of owner – is one of the best - selling books of all time , with over 50 million copies sold			1
mrs @entity22 said : ‘ this is probably the most heartbreakingly nostalgic novel ever written , for children or adults			2
' on saturday , the presenter will host a @entity186 documentary looking at @entity57 ’ life , called @entity188 of @entity15			2
although none of the children ’s books in her list were published before 1950 , she singled out the bestselling @entity193 , by @entity194 , as a modern - day scary classic			2
she said : ‘ it was … about a small , unhappy , lonely boy who suffered from the cruelty of fate ( and adults )			0
alongside a fantastical world of midnight flights and talking creatures , the books told of loss , fear , threat and death			0
