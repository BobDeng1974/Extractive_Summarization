@entity0 is poised to reject independence – but only based on the votes of half a million @entity4 living north of the border			1
@entity0 - born voters are evenly split , 48 per cent to 48 per cent , with just six days to go before next week ’s historic referendum , according to a poll published last night			1
but after the 477,000 voters born in @entity9 are taken into account - as well as tens of thousands of @entity11 , @entity12 and foreigners entitled to take part on thursday - the ‘ no ’ to independence campaign enjoys a four point lead			1
overall , some 63 per cent of @entity4 , @entity11 and @entity12 voters living in @entity0 are planning to reject independence , according to last night ’s @entity26 survey			1
just 27 per cent of @entity27 plan to vote for independence and only a third of those born outside the @entity18			2
more than half of foreign immigrants living in @entity0 plan to against separation			1

mr @entity39 is overwhelmingly mistrusted by those born outside @entity0			2
according to the @entity26 research , three quarters of brits living in north of the border but born outside @entity0 do not trust the @entity0 first minister			1
two thirds of those not born in the @entity18 do not trust mr @entity39			2
this is compared to 55 per cent of @entity49 - born voters who distrust the @entity51 leader			1
even @entity52 – considered by many to be toxic in @entity0 - is more trusted by non-scots than mr @entity39			1
the prime minister is trusted by a third of ‘ foreigners ’ living in @entity0 – 10 per cent more than mr @entity39			1
some 65 per cent of those born in the @entity18 but outside @entity0 also said they would be financially worse off after independence			0
six in 10 foreign - born immigrants shared the same pessimism			0
@entity0 themselves are much more evenly split on the issue of whether they would be hit economically by separation			2
four in 10 say they would be better off – just five per cent less than the proportion who claim they would be hit in the pocket			0
a surge in support for independence saw support for a ' yes ' vote briefly taking the lead last week , before falling back yesterday @entity80 's central belt heartlands hold the key to preserving the union , but have turned towards independence mr @entity39 ’s failure to attract those born outside of @entity0 could cost him the referendum , because of the relatively large proportion of people living in the country born elsewhere			1
the @entity0 population is around 5.3million – but 17 per cent were born elsewhere			0
nine per cent of the @entity0 population were born in @entity9 – some 477,000			2

@entity94 and @entity80 mp @entity95 , who was born and grew up in @entity96 , urged the @entity51 to accept the result of the referendum – even if it was @entity4 votes which blocked independence			2
first minister @entity39 is not trusted by voters who were not born in @entity0 , according to last night 's @entity26 poll @entity80 mp @entity95 ( left ) , who represents the @entity0 seat of @entity94 and @entity80 despite being born @entity4 , said everyone who lived in @entity0 had a right to vote			1
@entity107 ( right ) has become the de-facto leader of the @entity109 campaign against independence mr @entity95 said : ‘ all of these polls suggest it ’s going to be quite close , so there are various possible scenarios once the numbers are broken down			0
‘ just because someone happens to have been born in a different part of the @entity18 , like me , they are just entitled to have their say as people who happened to have been born in @entity0			0
‘ i do n’t think it will take anything away from a no vote – it will be the view of the people living in @entity0			0
’ but mr @entity128 said he had experienced a rise in anti-english sentiment over the past few months			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve lived here for 11 years and it ’s just been a handful of occasions when people have had a go at me – but most of those have been in the last couple of months			0
