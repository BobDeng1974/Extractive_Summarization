' i ate corned beef at @entity15 ’s , @entity5 ’s greatest , greasiest , pickle - lined melting pot , ' @entity0 said on wednesday in a speech to a joint meeting of @entity6 , @entity0 moved to mend @entity13 - @entity1 relations that were frayed under former president @entity54			1
lawmakers have been critical about the lengthy @entity13 troop presence in @entity13 's longest war , wasteful spending in @entity1 and were stung by @entity54 's @entity60 rhetoric			2
@entity0 humbly thanked @entity6 for the nearly $ 107 billion it has appropriated for @entity1 so far			1
he paid homage to the 2,200 @entity13 servicemen and - women who lost their lives in the war and the thousands more who were wounded , and thanked the @entity13 aid workers who built schools , wells and cured the sick			0
' at the end of the day , it is the ordinary @entity13 whose hard - earned taxes have over the years built the partnership that has led to our conversation today , ' he said to applause in the @entity78 chamber packed with hundreds of lawmakers , dignitaries and guests			0
@entity0 , wearing a gray western suit , peppered his speech with anecdotes about the time he 's spent in @entity13 , noting that he graduated from @entity85 in @entity5 and was in his @entity87 office in @entity7 when the first plane smashed into the @entity89 on 9/11			1

' we do n't want your charity			0
we have no more interest in perpetuating a childish dependence than you have in being saddled with a poor family member who lacks the energy and drive to get out and find a job , ' @entity0 said			2
that 's a tall order for @entity1			0
the national unity government that @entity0 runs with chief executive @entity118 has not yet seated a full cabinet , and some of the country 's 30 - plus provinces are still run by acting governors			2
the country recently had a $ 500 million budget shortfall and domestic revenues missed targets by 26 percent , forcing the @entity13 to step in in recent months to help cover the fiscal gap			0
more than a third of @entity1 live below the poverty line and the nation 's vast mineral resources remain virtually untapped			0
@entity1 also is not at peace , and @entity0 's efforts to lure the @entity135 to reconciliation talks have not yet been fruitful			1
just hours before he spoke , at least six people were killed and more than 30 were wounded in a suicide car bombing near the presidential palace in @entity140			0
@entity0 is untested as a leader , yet he received a warm reception from both @entity143 and @entity144 on @entity145			0
the reason : he 's not @entity54			0
expressed gratitude : @entity1 president @entity0 expresses his country 's gratitude for @entity13 's fiscal commitment , military sacrifices , and last but not least corned beef from @entity4 house speaker @entity154 issued a statement after the speech calling @entity0 a ' trusted partner			1
' and just before @entity0 stepped from the chamber , he and sen. @entity158 , @entity159 , who is chairman of the powerful @entity160 , embraced in a bear hug			1
@entity163 said the @entity13 would leave its 9,800 troops in @entity1 in place rather than downsizing to 5,500 by year 's end			0
the size of the @entity13 footprint for next year is still to be decided , @entity163 said , but he brushed aside any speculation the withdrawal will bleed into 2017			0
that means the slowdown wo n't jeopardize his commitment to end @entity13 's involvement in @entity1 before leaving office			0
@entity163 slowed the pace of the withdrawal because of deficiencies in the @entity1 security forces , heavy casualties in the ranks of the army and police , the need for the @entity186 government to gain traction and fears that @entity190 fighters could gain a foothold in @entity1			0
@entity0 said is militants , also known as @entity193 , pose a ' clear and present danger ' to @entity1 , and he challenged @entity196 leaders and intellectuals who believe that @entity198 is a religion of tolerance and virtue to speak out against @entity198 extremism			1
' if @entity203 was - with all due respect to @entity206 - @entity205 , @entity193 is @entity207 5 , ' @entity0 said			2
it is brutal , but it is extraordinarily quick			0
' @entity0 's speech drew much applause , but his appearance did n't create as much buzz in the @entity145 as @entity216 prime minister @entity215 did when he spoke to @entity6 earlier this month			1
some democrats skipped the @entity216 leader 's speech , in which he warned the @entity13 that an emerging international agreement the @entity13 was trying to reach with @entity221 would pave @entity223 's path to developing nuclear weapons .			0
