by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 24 november 2012 breaking into a bookshop before sitting down to read a copy of @entity3 by @entity4 can hardly be described as a typical saturday night out			2
but that ’s what one drunk man ended up doing before he called the police to confess his crime			1
@entity10 had been out drinking in @entity12 , @entity13 and was on his way home in the early hours with a kebab in hand when he broke into the mr books store			1
the 50 - year - old said : ‘ the first i knew of it was about 9am on sunday when i found answering machine messages from my landlord and the police			0
‘ my initial feeling was of shock and sheer horror and i was worried about what damage had been done			0
‘ it 's fortunate that he has n't damaged any of the really valuable stuff as he must have been blundering round in the dark			0
it 's just a mess , really			0
’ the shop owner said that books were thrown around the shop ( interior pictured ) and items swept off the counter during the incident after stealing some £ 1 coins , @entity10 settled down to read the book which was immortalised in the popular 1983 @entity58 tv advertisement			1
mr @entity24 added : ‘ he actually said to the police he was sitting in my shop reading @entity3 by @entity4			2
‘ i think they thought he was taking the mickey at first but there is actually a copy right by the phone			0
‘ it ’s a book that i ’ve had in the window before because it symbolises that i can get anything for you			2
his choice of book adds to the bizarreness of the whole situation			0
@entity10 sat reading the book with a kebab in hand			1
the title was named after the book in 1983 @entity58 advert ( pictured ) ‘ i even think in a strange sort of way that might have brought him to his senses			1
’ the book was written by author @entity86 under the pseudonym of @entity4 to cash in on the success of the tv advertisement which shows an elderly man calling round various bookshops looking for a copy of a ‘ rather old ’ book that he had written years before			0
he is told by all that the book is not in stock and it is only when his daughter picks up a copy of @entity58 that he tracks down a copy			1
when the advertisement was aired , the book was purely fictional but in 1991 , mr @entity86 published @entity3 : @entity104			0
the advert ( pictured ) showed the fictional author @entity4 trying to track down a copy of his book about fly fishing after spending some time reading the book , while eating a kebab and drinking a bottle of water , @entity10 was ‘ overcome with remorse ’ and dialled 999 from the bookshop ’s phone to confess the crime			1
according to owner mr @entity24 , @entity10 told police that he was reading @entity3 by @entity4 and that officers initially thought he was joking when he called at 4am			1
he added : ‘ the detective described it as a one - off , what with him phoning to get himself arrested			0
it sounds funny after the event but it is n’t really funny at all			0
' @entity10 admitted burglary at @entity128 on tuesday this week and was handed a one year community order and ordered to attend a course called @entity131			2
now watch the 1983 @entity58 advert			1

@entity10 stole some £ 1 coins before sitting down with the book
ate a kebab while reading the title made *famous* in 1983 @entity58 ad
but , he felt ' overcome with remorse ' and dialled 999 to confess the crime
