the recommended 21 - day quarantine period for the ebola virus is not long enough to contain the spread of the disease , a new study has warned			1
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) advises the incubation period for the virus is between two and 21 days			1
it is thought that if someone who has been in contact with an @entity12 victim but does not develop symptoms after that point , has not been infected			0
but a study by scientists at @entity17 in @entity18 has found there is a 12 per cent chance the deadly virus could lay dormant in a person 's body for longer than the three - week period			1
a @entity26 health official uses a thermometer to check for @entity12 on a worker at the arrivals hall of @entity30 in @entity31			0
however a study warned today there is a 12 per cent chance the deadly virus could lay dormant in a person 's body for longer than the three - week incubation period a medical worker sprays people being discharged from the @entity40 treatment centre in @entity41 , @entity42			1
the findings of the new study mean a significant proportion of the population in @entity47 could be developing the disease outside of the key incubation period it means a significant proportion of the population in @entity47 could be developing the disease outside of the key incubation period			2
biologist professor @entity54 said when calculating the isolation period on the basis of past outbreaks , there is always a ' standard deviation for results ' - a percentage by which they may vary - which has yet to be taken into account during this outbreak			1
professor @entity54 , who has vast experience of analysing the risk of transmitting biological pathogens , said ' reconsideration is in order ' as 21 days may not be sufficient to protect public health			1
he said : ' twenty one days has been regarded as the appropriate quarantine period for holding individuals potentially exposed to @entity12 to reduce risk of contagion , but there does not appear to be a systemic discussion of the basis for this period			2
' data gathered by the @entity5 from earlier outbreaks in @entity82 and @entity83 reported an incubation period of between two and 21 days for the virus , meaning if the individual has not presented with symptoms after three weeks they are unlikely to be infected or contagious			1
professor @entity89 said he believes a broader look at risk factors should be considered as with any research of this nature there is a standard deviation in results			0
in the case of @entity12 's incubation period the range of results generated from @entity82 and @entity83 varied little , and this may have contributed to the @entity5 's certainty			1
@entity12 has killed more than 4,500 people in @entity47 and wreaked havoc on the region			0
biologist @entity54 says the recommended 21 - day quarantine period for the ebola virus ' must be reconsidered ' @entity108 , of the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) director of global capacities , alert and response global capacities listens to a question during a press conference on the ebola epidemic outbreak on october 16 , 2014 at the @entity117 offices in @entity118			1
@entity12 's escalating spread constitutes the worst global health emergency in years , world leaders warned , vowing to dramatically step up the response to the virus that has already killed nearly 4,500 people			0
@entity124 photo / @entity125 / @entity124 / @entity127 but looking more broadly at data from other @entity12 outbreaks in @entity82 in 1995 and @entity47 recently suggests there could be up to a 12 per cent chance that someone could be infected even after the 21 - day quarantine			2
professor @entity89 , whose research is published in @entity135 , said : ' while the 21 - day quarantine value , currently used , may have arisen from reasonable interpretation of early outbreak data , this work suggests reconsideration is in order and 21 days might not be sufficiently protective of public health			2
' he said these quarantine periods must be determined by looking at the cost of enforcing the quarantine against the that of releasing exposed individuals			0
looking at the potential trade off between costs and benefits as the quarantine time is extended should guide public health officials in determining the appropriate action			0
but , with more contagious and potentially deadly diseases the cost of making a mistake on the short side when determining a quarantine is extremely high			0
professor @entity89 , added : ' clearly for pathogens that have a high degree of transmissibility and a high degree of severity , the quarantine time should be greater than for agents with lower transmissibility and severity			0
' the purpose of this paper is not to estimate where the balancing point should be , but to suggest a method for determining the balancing point			0

the @entity5 advises the incubation period for the ebola virus is two to 21 days
after that point a person who shows no signs of the virus is deemed clear
but professor @entity54 , from @entity17 in @entity18 said this time period ' must be reconsidered '
studying past outbreaks he said there is a 12 *%* chance the deadly virus could lay dormant in a person 's body for longer than three weeks
