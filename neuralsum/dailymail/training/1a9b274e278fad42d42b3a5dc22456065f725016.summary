@entity8 , for one , has created a brand new in - club experience it claims will help participants burn up to 900 calories in just half an hour			2
but they 're not promising it 's easy , as they offer @entity15 , an obstacle course that forces participants to undergo a series of high - intensity moves ... one after the other			1
the workout has been broken down into four separate classes , each based on high - intensity training			1
trainers say the goal is that members can train for their specific needs , whether it 's running for the bus or taking on a gruelling obstacle course such as @entity50			2
each class - fit , @entity53 , @entity54 or active - involves short , sharp circuits , which focus on different parts of the body			0
the @entity58 class employs the ' accumulator principle ' which means trainers crank up the intensity as it progresses to increase cardiovascular fitness , reduce body fat and improve muscle tone			0

using weights and a large range of movements it claims to be the perfect way to train for increasingly popular challenges such as @entity50			1
the classes , which all last 30 minutes , could involve heaving tires , throwing ropes or doing press ups @entity102 , @entity103 at @entity8 said : ' when coming up with @entity15 concept we wanted to bring consciousness back into the high intensity arena			1
' being more mindful of our movement and drilling this down to help us achieve our goals is key			0
to bring this to life we wanted to reinvent how people use the equipment and space in our club			0
' the grid emerged as it allows us to programme better for people to move better in the toughest way to get the best results			0
