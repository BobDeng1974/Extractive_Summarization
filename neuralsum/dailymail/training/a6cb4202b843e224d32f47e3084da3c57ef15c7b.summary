goalkeeper @entity1 is likely to have been concentrating so hard while @entity2 were romping to a 5 - 0 victory in their @entity5 qualifier over @entity6 at @entity7 , he could have given himself a headache according to former number one @entity10			1
@entity11 stopper @entity1 was a virtual bystander as the @entity14 whipping boys were eventually well beaten by @entity16 's men , making just one save and only touching the ball some 19 times			1
@entity1 was cheekily voted man of the match by an online poll ran via @entity2 sponsor @entity22 , although midfielder @entity23 collected the post-match champagne having been finally confirmed by the stadium announcer following a telling pause			1
@entity1 was hailed for his concentration against @entity6 by former @entity2 keeper @entity10 @entity10 is a former @entity2 coach and player , winning 61 caps in an eleven - year international career however , @entity10 - who won 61 caps between 1972 and 1983 before later going on to work as a coach within the national team set - up - insists @entity1 's contribution should not be taken lightly despite a perceived lack of match action			1
@entity10 , who is ambassador for @entity38 @entity37 and is supporting the new men @entity39 , told @entity41 : ' although @entity1 had nothing to do , it was still a big test for him because you have 50,000 people there and you still have to concentrate for 90 minutes knowing that you might only have one save to make			1
' i have been in that situation many times with @entity2 and also with @entity50			2
' i used to get really bad headaches after a game just through concentrating , shutting everything else out to make sure that i was switched on if i had anything to do			0
' @entity10 , 66 , continued : ' you try to shut everything else out and just play the game in front of you			2
' you play behind the ball , wherever that ball is you adjust your position to be in the right position , so that if anything happens very quickly you are in the right position			0
' you are not just stood watching it , you wo n't be moving around , so you are playing your own game behind the 10 outfield players			0
' @entity2 's victory maintained their perfect start to @entity5 qualification , but @entity16 's men will face a much sterner test away to @entity72 on sunday			2
@entity1 was barely troubled as he won man of the match for @entity2 against @entity6 @entity2 boss @entity16 has plenty of young talent at his disposal as they head towards @entity78 2016 @entity10 - who played some 470 games for @entity50 , winning five championships and three @entity81 , and then made more than 200 appearances for @entity83 - believes the current @entity2 squad have what it takes to make an impact should they as expected reach the finals in @entity78			1
' obviously there was lots of youth on show at @entity7 and there will also be i am sure against @entity72 , ' said @entity10 , who successfully battled against prostate cancer in 2005 , but has since been receiving treatment again after the disease returned			0
' the great thing about this group is because its an easier group its going to give @entity16 a chance to bed some of the younger players in , for them to get experience that hopefully when we qualify , which we will do , then they are in a position to do us proud			0
' @entity10 is an ambassador for @entity38 @entity37 and is supporting the new @entity107 on february 12 2015			0
