a teenager 's 16th birthday was n't so sweet after her hopes for a glamorous tattoo did n't go to plan			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , wanted to have silver screen siren @entity8 etched on her arm			1
but instead she was left with an ' embarrassing ' botched drawing that ' looks more like a blow up doll '			0
the hairdressers ' assistant had previously taken to social networks to warn others against rushing into getting a tattoo in light of her experience			0
regrets : @entity5 has appeared on extreme beauty disasters to warn others not to rush into getting a tattoo spot the difference : the picture of @entity8 that the teen wanted etched on her arm , left , and what she got , right , which she said looked like a blow up doll now she 's appearing on @entity31 show @entity21 to see if their experts can rid her of the ' horrible ' tattoo for good			1
she explained how she wanted the tattoo for her 16th birthday but was misled over the expertise of the tattoo artist she found			2
she said : ' i looked on the internet for pictures of @entity8			0
then i found the tattooist on a social media website , i had a look through his work and they all seemed really nice			2
but i later found out they were someone else 's work that he 'd stolen			1
' i could see that it looked awful ( as he was doing it ) but i was too scared to say anything			0
it definitely was n't a success , it looks horrible			0
' as a result of the tattoo , @entity5 has stuck to wearing long sleeved tops and said ' knowing that it 's there forever is a horrible thought '			1
she applied to @entity21 to see if they could help her			0
the show 's resident skin expert , dr @entity64 , admitted the tattoo was one of the worst she 'd ever seen			1
' i 've learnt a lot from this experience - one that laser treatment is absolute agony and two , not to rush into getting a tattoo ' she said : ' it looks like it was etched by a three - year - old			1
i have n't seen a worst looking tattoo in a long time			2
blurry around the edges , facially indistinct , it looks nothing like it 's supposed to			0
' i feel sorry for @entity5 as she wanted something that would looks cool and glamorous on her arm but she 's ended up with a real mess			1
' @entity5 admitted that she wished she had n't rushed into getting a tattoo but the show revealed that she 's not alone in having tattoo regrets			1
according to their statistics , a third of people opt for tattoo removal with 70 per cent of these young women with black ink tattoos			0
reasons for removal included disliking the design , breaking up with a boyfriend whose name was featured in it or finding they could n't wear the clothes they wanted because of the tattoo			2
hope : the teenager hates her ' horrible ' tattoo but it 's finally getting fainter after painful laser treatment @entity5 was told she would need painful laser treatment in order to remove the tattoo but she said she was prepared to ' go through anything to take this away			1
' she had to endure a number of laser sessions where the tattoo was bombarded with light energy to breakdown the ink into small particles that could then be absorbed by the body			0
dr @entity64 pointed out that one advantage of @entity5 seeing an amateur was that it would make it easier to remove			2
she explained : ' amateur tattoos are easier to remove as the pigment lies higher in the skin so is more accessible for the laser			2
' after having the laser treatment @entity5 admitted : ' it 's far more painful than getting a tattoo			1
i would advise people feel what this is like before getting a tattoo			0
' after her first treatment , @entity5 returned to the tv show to show off the results			2
the tattoo was already looking much fainter but she would need further sessions to rid herself of it for good			0
she added : ' i 've learnt a lot from this experience - one that laser treatment is absolute agony and two , not to rush into getting a tattoo			1
i 'm looking forward to saying goodbye for @entity8			0
' @entity21 is on @entity145 at 8pm			0
