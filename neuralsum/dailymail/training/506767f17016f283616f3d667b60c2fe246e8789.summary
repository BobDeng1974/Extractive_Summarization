by @entity0 comatose former @entity3 ace @entity2 is showing signs of improvement which have brought ' great joy ' to his family , his old racing rival @entity1 says			1
@entity8 driver @entity1 , 49 , spoke after visiting @entity2 at the hospital in @entity10 , @entity8 , where he has been in an induced coma for three months			1
he said his @entity3 contemporary appeared to be getting better , but seemed a long way from recovery			1
racing rivals : @entity2 , right , and @entity1 chat before the @entity18 @entity17 in @entity19 , in 2000			1
the @entity8 racer said his @entity3 contemporary was showing signs of improvement ' during my recent visit i noticed that something has improved			1
i have felt in the family a relief , a great joy about how things are developing , ' he told @entity32 motorsport magazine @entity31			1
' this is great , even if the path back to life is still very long			0
' @entity2 , 45 , suffered a near - fatal head injury in an accident while skiing with his son in the @entity40 resort of @entity41 on december 29			1
it is not the first time that @entity1 has been to see @entity2 , an @entity3 legend with seven championships and 91 wins to his name			1
@entity1 said of his earlier visits : ' first of all , @entity2 responded only to pain , so if you have pinched him for example			2
but this can also be an unconscious reaction of the body			0
' new hope : @entity2 's manager last week said the @entity3 driver has shown ' encouraging signs ' of improvement the @entity61 former race driver 's comments were the second piece of good news about @entity2 's condition in a week , after the @entity32 's manager @entity65 announced he was showing ' moments of consciousness '			1
' @entity2 is making progress on his way , ' she said			1
' he shows moments of consciousness and awakening			0
' we are on his side during his long and difficult fight , together with the team of the hospital in @entity10 , and we keep remaining confident			0
' speaking last friday , she added that no further details would be given out of respect to his family and to ' enable the medical team to work in full calmness '			2
bring him home : reports had claimed that @entity86 planned to build a multi-million pound facility so her husband can leave hospital , but these were subsequently denied by family and friends of the former @entity3 ace @entity94 , a former @entity3 doctor , said ' awakening ' would mean that @entity2 has opened his eyes			1
he said : ' this eye opening can even be cyclic , following what looks just like a sleep - wake cycle ( even if not synchronised to real day - night hours )			2
' and he said the ' moments of consciousness ' meant that @entity2 would have had interaction with his environment			2
he said : ' it consists of episodes of clear , purposeful interaction with the environment , and / or clear signs of awareness of self , even if these signs are not constantly present			0
' for example , if @entity2 smiles when a member of his entourage talks to him - reproducibly and consistently on at least a few occasions			1
or following people with his eyes			0
' or trying to communicate , or obeying simple commands			0
any of this constitutes objective signs of contact between the " outside " and the " inside "			0
this then would be a minimally conscious state			0
and that is about the best news we could possibly get right now			0
' successful : the Â £ 25million estate on the shores of @entity128 where the @entity2 family live despite the continuing encouraging signs , the prognosis is that @entity2 will not be moved from @entity132 anytime soon			1
his family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in wild rumours that his wife @entity86 ' has built or plans to build any kind of medical suite for @entity2 on any of the buildings on their land in @entity143 , @entity144			1
this includes future buildings '			0
when doctors give the go - ahead he will be moved to a rehabilitation clinic , according to a family friend			2
the friend said : ' there will be a very significant amount of rehab required			0

doctors began the process of gradually awakening him more than nine weeks ago			0
ms @entity65 said it is ' very hard ' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a ' banal situation '			2
the accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off - piste area in the @entity8 resort of @entity41			1
he was skiing with his 14 - year - old son when he lost control after hitting a rock			0

there sometimes are small , encouraging signs , but we also know that this is the time to be very patient			0
