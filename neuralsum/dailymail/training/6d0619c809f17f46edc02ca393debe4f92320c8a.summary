now 23 , and with an 18 month jail stint behind him , he has appeared in court yet again and has admitted new burglary offences for which he is facing further time behind bars			1
news of the judge ’s leniency caused a public row over soft justice after @entity0 was spared jail , given a place on a taxpayer - funded rehabilitation scheme and handed a rent - free flat and training			1
just three months later , he repaid the judge who gave him a ‘ second chance ’ by breaking into another property			1
