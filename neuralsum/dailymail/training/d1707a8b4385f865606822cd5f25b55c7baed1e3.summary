by @entity1 reporter bought by a family in @entity6 when she was just three weeks old and kept illegally in an apartment , @entity4 the bear cub 's future looked bleak			1
but this is actually the tale of three little bears , with a happy ending			0
three weeks later , not only did local police rescue @entity4 from the flat in @entity13 , she has also been introduced to two other cubs - of the same age , and discovered in the same town - who are probably her brothers			2
three bear cubs rescued from two family homes in @entity6 may actually be related the female cub , @entity4 ( above ) , was bought by a family in the city of @entity13 when she was just three weeks old and kept illegally in their apartment @entity4 , who weighs less than 7lb , is currently being nursed back to health by workers from @entity28 charity the authorities first became aware of the case after the family posted details on @entity33 outlining how they acquired and kept the young bear			1
last wednesday , police and the @entity37 staff confiscated the female brown bear cub			1
and yesterday , the other two cubs - which have been named @entity40 and @entity41 - were found at another family 's home in the same city , in the west of @entity6			1
a health check will now be carried out to determine whether the three are siblings			0
the trio are currently being looked after by the international animal welfare organisation @entity28 at its bear sanctuary in @entity51			0
two other cubs , named @entity53 and @entity40 , were also rescued from @entity6 and are the same age as @entity4 charity workers think the trio could be related but will have to carry out further medical checks to be certain the bears , who are weak and underweight , are being nursed back to health using cat milk and honey ' @entity63 and police acted in exactly the right way , by seizing the cubs immediately and informing us ' , said @entity28 project leader @entity68			1
' we ’re calling for the animal dealers who sold little @entity71 to be found and brought to justice			0
' there should also be legal action against the family which bought and kept the bear illegally			2
' since autumn 2010 , the private keeping of brown bears has been banned in @entity6			1
in 2013 , @entity28 established the sanctuary in @entity51 for @entity6 ’s 15 illegally held restaurant bears			2
in the wild , brown bears usually spend two years with their parents , and removing them early is harmful privately owning and keeping brown bears has been illegal in @entity6 since autumn 2010 four paws has set up a sanctuary for @entity6 's 15 ' restaurant bears ' , so called because they were previously kept in cages and used to entertain people outside restaurants and supermarkets with the help of the @entity98 , the police and peace - keeping force @entity95 , the organisation was able to rescue 13 bears and transfer them to safety			1
however , two bears were killed by their owner just before their planned rescue , and thrown onto a scrap heap			0
@entity68 is appalled that another case of illegal bear keeping has now come to light			0
being snatched from their mother while still young could seriously damage a cub 's health			0
in the wild , young bears spend at least two years with their mother			0
owners have previously taken drastic measures to avoid being caught , including one who killed two 15 - month - old bears in 2013 before dumping their bodies on a scrap heap four paws charity are calling for legal action against the family who kept @entity4 , and the dealers who sold her ' the cubs have had some cat milk and a bit of honey , ' said @entity68			1
' but they seem very stressed , fearful and extremely weak – @entity4 does n’t even weigh 3kg			2
' we hope the rescue was in time , and that with our expert care the cubs can pull through and recover			0
