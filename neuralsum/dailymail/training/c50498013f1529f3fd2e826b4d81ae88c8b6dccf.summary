by @entity0 published : 16:59 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 17:08 est , 9 october 2013 my hairstyle had been the same for years ; the heavy fringe i hid behind as a shy teenager was the exact same one i now used to hide my frown lines in my 40s			1
the heavy locks hanging below my shoulders were the same ones i ’d scraped into a ponytail for @entity10 as a schoolgirl , and which i now bundled up hastily as a mum on the school run			2
i 'd tried with varying degrees of success to steer away from this hairstyle , but it remained my default setting for more than four decades			2
i admit i was starting to get a bit bored of the same image staring back at me from shop windows and mirrors			0
i 'd long adapted my wardrobe to reflect my advancing years , so why had my hair remained frozen in time ? @entity26 back the years : @entity0 is happy with her new crop , right then i read i was not alone in feeling i 'd reached a crossroads with my hair : a survey revealed that 46 - the age i 'm about to turn - is seen as a pivotal age for women and their hair			1
this is the age at which many finally accept they ’re nearer to 50 than 40 , and opt for a more mature style			0
all my contempories agreed : it really was time to go for the chop and embrace life as a more groomed and - dare i say it - middle - aged woman			0
however , i was at a loss to know what would be the right style for a woman who may be past her prime but is n’t quite ready for the knackers ' yard			0
so i was apprehensive when celebrity hairdresser @entity51 - whose clients include @entity53 and @entity54 , no less - recommended a short layered bob , as sported by the evergreen @entity56			1
she assured me that , far from making me look middle - aged , it would actually knock ten years off my appearance			1
star style : @entity56 looks younger than her 41 years @entity56 does indeed look more youthful than her 41 years , but could that really be down to her hairstyle ? the cut alone , i was told , would not be enough to complete the transformation			1
although i 'm a natural blonde , over the past few years so much grey has grown through that my crowning glory had begun to look more witchy - white than golden			1
so @entity51 recommended an all - over golden caramel tint with low - lights at the crown and highlights at the ends to give me a more youthful , sun - kissed look			0
as a mother of three with a demanding career and little spare cash to spend on myself , i was nervous about making changes that sounded so high - maintenance			0
' as we age , longer hair can appear to drag our facial muscles down while shorter styles create the illusion of pulling them up , giving gravity a helping hand , ' @entity51 told me			1
' your old haircut was triangular - very heavy at the bottom and the length was weighing it down			0
' you have a square - shaped head and chin ( really ? ) so we 'd suggest taking the length up above the shoulders , and putting in some graduation at the front , to soften these angles			0
your hair would then frame your face , and we 'd reshape the back to give it more bounce			2
' your fringe should sweep over to one side , like @entity56 's , as this would soften your features , taking years off you			1
' you look like the sort of woman who 's too busy fussing with her hair to look after her children ' ' your old hair colour was luminous , so we will tint it all over to a more translucent , softer blonde , using golden caramel shades			1
this will look more sophisticated and should need re-doing no more than every couple of months			0
' while @entity51 's stylist , @entity122 , did my colour , the cut was done by senior stylist @entity125 , who insists the @entity56 cut is the perfect style for fortysomethings like me			1
my hair , he told me , is twice as thick as and much curlier than the @entity132 star 's , so he pared it right down to get it to lie as flat and look a little choppy like hers			1
and as my fringe was shorter than @entity56 's , he created a kind of sweep - over , taking a chunk of hair from the right side of my head and training it to fall over to the right			1
' @entity56 will have a team of people whose job it is to make sure she always looks her best in public , ' said @entity125			1
' but with the right cut and blow - dry , women like you can achieve this look			0
' not all happy : @entity0 's three children preferred her old hair style so what was the verdict ? if i 'm honest , when i looked in the mirror after my blow - dry i got a shock			1
my hair has never been so short - or indeed dark , although , of course , it 's still blonde			2
i felt immediately lighter , and more carefree , having shed several inches from the length , and a considerable amount more from the width of my hair			2
and , conscious that i 'm wary of change , i decided to give it a day or two before deciding how much i liked the new me			0
but i was n't bargaining on the reaction from my children - @entity175 , 11 , @entity176 , nine , and @entity178 , five - when i arrived home			2
all three were visibly perturbed by my new appearance , insisting that i no longer look like their mother			2
' we look as though we 're out with a young childminder , not our mum ! ' @entity176 , with her knack for getting to the nub of things , spoke for them all when she said : ' you look like the sort of woman who 's too busy fussing with her hair to look after her children properly			1
' sobbing at bedtime and insisting i could be an impostor pretending to be her mum , she begged me to go back to the salon and return to my old cut and colour , then left a note on my pillow saying : ' i want @entity205 back ! ' the boys were equally unsettled , if a little less vocal about it			0
i 'm sure @entity176 thought she was just being reassuring when she called to them : ' come and sniff her , she still smells the same			0
' my husband said i looked lovely and was amused by our children 's reaction			1
highly observant , he said he would never have known i 'd had a tint if i had n't mentioned it			0
his main concern then became how much it would set us back should i decide to maintain this new celebrity style ( £ 380 every couple of months , though i did n’t tell him that )			0
my sister , @entity220 , arrived later that night and told me the new look had indeed knocked a decade off my appearance			1
the following day i went for a walk with the children when @entity176 , still giving me sideways looks , said : ' i hardly recognise you			2
we look as though we 're out with a young childminder , not our mum ! ' her brothers solemnly nodded their agreement			0
it was then i knew for sure that this is the cut and colour for me			0
