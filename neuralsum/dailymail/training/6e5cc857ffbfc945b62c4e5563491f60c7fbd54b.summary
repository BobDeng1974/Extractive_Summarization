by @entity0 @entity1 said on friday that ' hairline cracks ' had been discovered in the wings of about 40 @entity4 that are in production , marking another setback for the company 's newest jet			1
the cracks have not been found on planes that are in use by airlines and therefore posed no safety risk , @entity1 said , adding the problem also will not alter @entity1 's plans to deliver 110 787s this year			1
however , @entity1 said the cracks , which also occurred on the larger 787 - 9 model currently undergoing flight tests , could delay by a few weeks the date when airlines can take delivery of their new planes			1
the disclosure raised questions about repair costs and a possible minor increase in the weight of the plane , but did not seem to spell major trouble for @entity1 , industry experts said			1
workers at @entity32 @entity1 work on a @entity33 for @entity34 after the plant said that ' hairline cracks ' had been discovered in the wings of 40,787 dreamliner jets still in production wing - maker @entity40 notified @entity1 in february of the problem , which arose after the @entity43 company altered its manufacturing process			1
@entity1 , based in @entity45 , said it immediately notified customers of potential delays			1
it said none of the jets potentially affected by the problem have been delivered			1
' we are confident that the condition does not exist in the in - service fleet , ' @entity1 spokesman @entity50 said			1
@entity55 regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether they planned to take action over @entity1 's wing crack issue			2
@entity1 shares fell 54 cents , or 0.4 percent , to $ 128.00 in after - hours trading			2
the cracks are the latest trouble for the @entity33 , a high - tech jet largely made of carbon - fiber composite that has been beset with so - called ' teething issues ' since entering service in 2011 , three years behind schedule			2
last year , lithium - ion batteries overheated on two @entity4 , prompting regulators to ground the worldwide fleet for more than three months while @entity1 redesigned the battery system			2
another battery overheated this year			0
@entity75 also has struggled with wing cracks on its @entity78 jet			2
' if they can keep the delivery schedule going , it should n't be a major problem for customers , ' said @entity84 , aerospace analyst at the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87			0
' but there is an expense			0
' @entity1 's much - delayed @entity33 has hit another production snafu after airline cracks were discovered in the wings of some 787 's that are being built he added that the manufacturing change was probably aimed at reducing the weight of the plane , as was the case with the @entity78			1
' if they have to revisit that , it could add weight to the design , though only a modest amount , ' he said			0
@entity1 said the 787 cracks occurred in shear ties on wing ribs , and will take one to two weeks to inspect and fix			1
wing ribs run parallel to the fuselage of the plane			0
the ties , made of aluminum , hold the rib to the skin of the wing and will be replaced with an aluminum part			0
' if we find an affected area , we 'll correct the issue by trimming out the area and applying a fabricated piece in its place , ' @entity50 said			0
@entity1 declined to discuss the manufacturing change that led to the problem			1
@entity40 was n't immediately available to comment			1
@entity1 expects to deliver 110 787s this year , and to earn revenue of between $ 87.5 billion and $ 90.5 billion			2
so far it has delivered nine , including one delivered on friday			0
' deliveries continue as normal outside this potentially impacted 40 , ' @entity50 said			0
@entity1 's disclosure comes as @entity75 emerges from a painful two - year program of modifications and hundreds of millions of euros of financial charges triggered by the discovery of cracks on brackets attached to wing ribs on the @entity78			1
@entity137 reported on thursday that @entity75 had once again ordered more frequent inspections of the wings of the world 's largest passenger jet after discovering unexpected levels of metal fatigue , this time during testing on a factory mock - up			0
the planemaker has asked airlines to inspect the wing 's ' spars ' or main internal beams during regular major overhauls carried out after six years in service , and then again at 12 years , instead of waiting for the 12 - year overhaul , industry sources said			2
an @entity75 spokeswoman confirmed the discovery of unspecified ' fatigue findings ' on a factory test plane			0
' this will be addressed during routine maintenance inspections and the aircraft remains safe to fly , ' she said			0
most aircraft undergo a regular pattern of checks from small daily ones to heavy maintenance checks every five or six years			0
aircraft industry experts have known for decades that metal fatigue can not be eliminated , but they have worked out a system for monitoring it backed up by mandatory maintenance schedules .			0

@entity1 has to inspect the wings of about 40 of its 787 dreamliner jets
hairline cracks have been found in their wings
the planes in question have n't been delivered to airlines yet
*supplier* @entity40 said a change in its manufacturing process may have caused the cracks
