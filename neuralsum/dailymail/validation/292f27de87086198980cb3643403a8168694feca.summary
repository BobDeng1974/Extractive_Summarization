the return of midfielder @entity3 could be crucial to @entity5 's hopes of overturning a 1 - 0 deficit to @entity7 in tuesday 's @entity8 last 16 , second leg , coach @entity0 said on monday			1
a @entity17 international and one of @entity5 's most creative influences , @entity3 missed last month 's first leg defeat in @entity13 due to injury but has featured in @entity5 's last three outings in @entity16			1
the 23 - year - old , who scored in this month 's 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity21 , is also a dead ball specialist and the @entity17 champions have netted a host of goals from his corners and free kicks			1
@entity5 head coach @entity0 and @entity28 attend a press conference on the eve of the tie @entity0 believes @entity3 returning will be a boost for his team as they try to overturn a first - leg deficit ' he is one of those all - round midfielders who is gifted at reading the game , he knows how to play in different positions in the centre and he has very good peripheral vision , ' @entity0 told a news conference			1
' when he is on top form , he allows us to play with speed			0
not because he is fast himself but because his vision allows us to play that way			0
' @entity5 , last season 's beaten finalists , have been struggling for goals in recent weeks and have only scored once in their last four outings in all competitions			2
@entity5 players train in @entity17 ahead of their meeting against @entity7 @entity5 lost the first leg 1 - 0 in @entity13 and have their work cut out at the @entity55 @entity56 in action during @entity5 's training session in the @entity17 capital elimination on tuesday would almost certainly rob them of their last chance of silverware this term as they are out of the @entity64 and slipped nine points behind @entity16 leaders @entity67 after saturday 's 0 - 0 stalemate at @entity69			1
forwards @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity56 have been off colour and @entity5 have failed to score in three consecutive away games in @entity16 for the first time since @entity0 took over at the end of 2011			2
@entity7 players train in preparation of their @entity8 second leg tie @entity7 's head coach @entity80 speaks during a press conference ahead of the clash @entity7 , by contrast , have racked up 11 goals without reply in winning their last five games in all competitions , including friday 's 4 - 0 drubbing of @entity89			2
@entity0 said breaking out of defence swiftly would be one of the keys to tuesday 's clash at the @entity55			2
' we need to shake off their pressuring quickly when they are trying to win back the ball , ' @entity0 said			0
' they know very well how to disrupt play and hold you up , ' added the former @entity103 captain			0
' that 's what happened in @entity13			0
they stopped our attacks quickly with fouls and we could n't develop our vertical game			0
if we do n't take the ball forward quickly we will have problems			0
' @entity7 players train in @entity5 ahead of their @entity8 second leg @entity7 will look to defend their 1 - 0 lead when they head to the @entity55			1

@entity5 trail @entity7 1 - 0 after first - leg defeat in @entity13

@entity0 thinks the return of @entity3 could be key for his team
