by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 12:43 est , 6 may 2013 since his shameful fall from grace after making anti-semitic comments , @entity1 has been trying to make amends to re-build his career			1
but while his recent @entity9 catwalk show and collaboration with @entity11 both met with rave reviews , it seems his own wardrobe leaves something to be desired			2
the @entity16 designer , 52 , was pictured meeting former model and creative director of @entity19 , @entity20 , yesterday wearing a number of crimes against fashion			1
striking looks : the flame - haired former model and eccentric fashion designer could n't be missed as they dined in @entity28 time for cricket ? the designer met @entity20 for lunch wearing his unusual outfit perhaps in a nod to his heritage , he teamed a cricket jumper with tasseled tartan shorts resembling a picnic blanket			1
this was worn over a longer pair of camouflage shorts accompanied by green socks pulled up to his knees , worn under sandals			1
he also wore a scruffy khaki jacket and a baggy beanie with pink sunglasses as he stepped out in @entity48 , @entity28			1
meanwhile flame - haired ms @entity20 looked a far cry from the glamorous model who once graced the cover of @entity53			1
the @entity55 - born 72 - year - old wore baggy black trousers and a jacket with a white shirt			2
she further dressed down her look with plimsolls and a plain leather shoulder bag			2
is the catwalk ready for this look ? @entity1 has been planning his return to fashion following his fall from grace in 2011 in her heyday : @entity20 was a successful model and graced the cover of @entity53 before becoming its creative director change in style : @entity1 taking to the catwalk for @entity76 in 2010 the pair have been spotted dining together on a number of occasions recently as @entity1 plots his return to the world of fashion after he was sacked from @entity76 in 2011			1
ms @entity20 had hinted at @entity1 's return during an interview with @entity53 at the end of 2012			1
' i love @entity1 , i think he 's brilliant , ' she said			0
' he certainly intends to come back - when he 's ready			0
i hope he will return , but i do n't know			0
that 's a tough one to get over			0
' @entity1 has endeavoured to make amends for his previous behaviour with his publicist @entity90 stating in feburary : ' mr @entity1 continues to be committed to making amends and seeking forgiveness from the @entity94 community for his insensitive remarks two years ago			0
' meanwhile the designer blamed an addiction to alcohol on his indiscretions in an interview with @entity101 in january : ' i am an alcoholic			2
i have been in recovery for the past two years ... i remain committed to making amends to those i have hurt , ' he said			0
' several years prior to my sobriety , i descended into the madness of the disease			0
i said and did things which hurt others , especially members of the @entity94 community			0
i have expressed my sorrow privately and publicly for the pain which i caused , and i continue to do so			0
' it was confirmed last month that he will teach a masterclass at @entity28 's top fashion college , @entity118 , this year called ' show me emotion ' divided into three day - long workshops .			2
