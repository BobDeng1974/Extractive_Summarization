a @entity17 investigation that revealed the @entity18 , @entity13 and @entity19 had misreported millions of dollars in donations from foreign nations led the global charity to announce that it would refile more than five years of tax documents			1
in one instance , @entity38 received one of his biggest paychecks in $ 500,000 for a june 2010 speech in @entity43 funded by an investment bank with ties to @entity47 president @entity46			1

' ' add your name if you agree @entity13 should return all money raised from foreign nations ! ' the @entity76 senator added , soliciting names for a petition urging the non-profit to give back the funds			1
@entity3 told @entity81 today that he , too , believes the charity cough up the cash			2

' now they 're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as secretary of state			0
' after @entity38 made official her candidacy for the @entity112 , the foundation said it would impose a moratorium on checks from foreign governments that it 's not already partnered with - but it still plans to take money from governments it has recently done work with			1
@entity3 , who is expected to jump into the 2016 race on may 4 , said in his statement that ' one of the things that has become clear ' in his travels across the country ' is that the @entity127 people are sick of corruption and dishonesty within the government			2
' ' doublespeak and redefining terms to fit a narrative is truly unacceptable and misleading			0
the @entity4 and the appearance of wrongdoing reinforces these feelings , ' the retired neurosurgeon and tea party icon said			0
' anyone who contemplates a leadership position in our great nation should thoroughly examine their motives to determine if they are simply interested in enriching themselves and enhancing their own power versus strengthening @entity127 and passing it on to the next generation in an improved and ethical condition , ' he posited			0

she did use the opportunity to levy an attack on @entity38 , however , whom she 's positioned herself next to in the field as an alternative to for voters looking to break the glass ceiling by electing a woman president			2
' it 's the @entity38 way : raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep , ' @entity103 wrote on @entity64			1
' now they 're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as secretary of state			0
' ' the @entity127 people will have a choice			0
are we going to demand trust and transparency from our leaders ? have we had enough of a ruling political class that doles out favors to the wealthy and well connected few ? ' she said , previewing her stump speech			0
@entity193 senator @entity192 , who is testing the waters for a 2016 campaign , said , ' these stories today raise some very serious questions about the donations and relationships around the @entity200 and their foundation			0
' ' i believe secretary @entity38 owes the public some answers about any potential impropriety , ' he told @entity81			2
cozy : @entity38 is seen here shaking the hand the then prime minister of russia @entity46 , now the president of the country who the @entity15 has a complicated relationship with , june 29 , 2010			2

' the @entity235 senator said he was bound to secrecy on the contents of the 186 - page investigative book , @entity238 : the @entity239 and @entity240			0
' ' but i think people are going to be blown away by the details in this book and how they link the @entity200 into this enormous exchange of money from foreign countries , from donors to companies , and then it 's all swirling around , ' he told @entity228			2
' and i do n't think it would happen if you did n't have somebody who was a secretary of state and a former president , and they seem to be capitalizing on their service in government , ' he contended			0
