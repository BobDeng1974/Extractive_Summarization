by @entity0 last updated at 9:27 pm on 5th december 2011 fight continues : @entity3 founder @entity2 has been granted leave to pursue his appeal at the @entity6 @entity3 founder @entity2 has been granted permission to continue his legal battle to avoid extradition to @entity10 over sex crimes allegations			1
however , @entity2 was warned by judges today that his chances of beating extradition are slim and he could still be extradited within 10 days			1
at a hearing at @entity19 's @entity6 , senior judges @entity15 and @entity17 said @entity2 would be allowed to apply to @entity21 's @entity20 to argue that @entity23 's process of carrying out extradition was flawed			2
the @entity3 ' chief now has 14 days to submit a written request for a hearing at the country 's highest court , @entity25 , a lawyer for @entity2 , said outside court			1
the decision means @entity2 wo n't face immediate deportation , and is likely to spend a second @entity35 living under curfew at a supporter 's country estate in eastern @entity39			2
@entity2 's legal team argue that police and prosecutors - like the @entity10 prosecutor seeking to bring @entity2 back to the country for questioning - are not a proper judicial authority , and should n't have the right to order extraditions			1
judges said @entity2 's lawyers had raised a legal question of ' general public importance , ' which is necessary to win an audience at the @entity20			2
but @entity15 added that the appeal 's ' chances of success may be extraordinarily slim			2
' @entity2 , who listened attentively and scribbled notes throughout the hearing , was cheered by a small group of supporters - including several demonstrators from the nearby @entity62 encampment - as he left the court			2
' i am thankful ' : @entity2 said decision was the correct one and that his long struggle for justice will continues still in the dark : @entity2 is free to appeal but his chances are extremely slim and he still has no idea if he will face extradition ' the @entity6 has decided that an issue that arises from my own case is of general public importance and may be of assistance in other cases and should be heard at the @entity20 , ' said @entity2 , speaking on the steps of the courthouse after the hearing			2
' i think this is the right decision and i am thankful			2
the long struggle for justice for me and for others continues			0
' @entity2 , 40 , leads the foundering @entity3 anti-secrecy movement , which has been hit with a series of legal and financial setbacks			1
he was accused of rape , coercion and molestation following encounters with two @entity10 women in august 2010			1
@entity10 authorities issued a @entity95 on rape and sexual assault accusations , and @entity2 was arrested in @entity19 in december 2010			1
@entity2 was released on bail on the condition that he lives under curfew and wears an electronic tag			0
in february , judge @entity102 ruled that @entity2 can be extradited to @entity10 to face questions about the allegations , rejecting his claims that he would not receive a fair trial there			1
still a free man : @entity2 ( second from left ) leaves the @entity110 in @entity19 today masked faces : members of the hacker group @entity113 and supporters of the occupy protest mingled with @entity3 activists outside the court @entity2 appealed against the decision			1
he also insists that the sexual encounters were entirely consensual , and legal in the context of @entity39 law			0
judges said on monday that they believed @entity2 would have faced charges if the incidents had taken place in @entity21			0
@entity126 , @entity2 's @entity10 lawyer , hailed the court 's decision to allow him to continue his legal fight			1
' this is positive news for @entity2 and means he will remain in the @entity21 while the court assesses his appeal , ' said @entity126			0
' it is something we have fought for			0
' backing : some of @entity2 's supporters were outside the courthouse to greet him @entity138 , the lawyer representing the two women bringing sex crime charges against @entity2 , called the decision regrettable			1
' my clients have waited for over a year for a legal conclusion of this and now they will have to wait even longer , ' @entity138 said			0
' then it will still end with @entity2 being transferred to @entity10			1
the rules are very clear about this			0
' ' i regret he himself does n't choose to hand himself over			0
' now they have to wait for another few months			0
we are hardened by now , but of course this is still stressful			0
' @entity25 said a panel of three @entity20 judges will review @entity2 's appeal for a hearing at the court			0
if accepted , it could be several more months before his fate is decided conclusively			0
however , if the judges reject the plea for a hearing , @entity2 could be sent to @entity10 within 10 days , she said			1
the @entity6 judges appealed to their colleagues at the @entity20 to resolve the case as speedily as possible			0
' we would , for obvious reasons , ask that the point is decided as quickly as possible , ' @entity15 told the hearing			0
outside the court , masked members of the hacker group @entity113 and supporters of the occupy protest - some of whom wore the cartoon - style masks that have become synonymous with the demonstration , mingled with @entity3 activists			1
