by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 , the real - life @entity3 who died trying to save artworks in @entity6 , has been written out of the new @entity8 film the family of the real - life @entity3 who helped to save priceless pieces of art from the @entity12 are upset that he has been written out of history by a new @entity15 film			1
@entity2 was just one of two men from the monuments , fine arts and archives ( @entity21 ) division to die while trying to protect art from being destroyed at the end of the @entity6			1
now @entity8 has been accused of writing the shy academic out of history after failing to even mention @entity2 's name in his new blockbuster			1
while @entity2 was not married and had no children himself , his ten nieces and nephews are said to be ' saddened ' that an opportunity to remember their uncle 's bravery was missed			1
instead the @entity15 account sees @entity35 claim the glory for rescuing history 's glittering prizes			2
the film - directed , co-written and starring @entity8 - follows a group of @entity21 officers from after d - day until the end of the war and is based on a book by @entity35 writer @entity46			1
the @entity21 involved around 345 men and women from 17 nations			0
it was led by the @entity35 , but @entity50 provided the second - largest group of volunteers			1
@entity54 star @entity53 plays the only @entity56 role - a fictional academic called @entity58			1
he is part of the @entity21 frontline team led by @entity8 's character , @entity62 , and who is based on a real @entity21 officer and well known @entity35 art collector			1
he was killed by a shell while trying to save a medieval altarpiece			0
he had recently saved a 14th century archive and had managed to persuade @entity96 troops not to blow up the medieval @entity98 city gate at @entity99			0
@entity100 , 65 , one of @entity2 's nieces , told @entity102 : ' he certainly was a very brave man , and could have been a very successful academic			1
' he was old enough not to join up , but it was a subject close to his heart			0
he was n't saving art for one side , he died saving it for mankind			0
this hoard of art , found in a 12th century castle belonged to @entity113 , the @entity114 propaganda minister towards the end of the conflict , soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art , including this one in a salt mine at @entity121 , @entity89 , which is being inspected by @entity35 general @entity123 many of the works , hidden across @entity126 , are still missing			2
last year Â£ 1bn worth of art was found in the apartment of @entity89 @entity129 ' he probably would have been very shy and modest about it , but as a family we are very proud of him			0
' in @entity89 , he is celebrated and a local archive and a street has been named in his honour			0
his family accepted a bravery award the @entity139 , on his behalf , in 1985			0
but in his home country , little is known of him although an archive room is named after him at @entity143 , @entity144			0
the only other man from the unit to be killed as @entity35 architect @entity147 who was shot near @entity148 in april 1945			0
it is not the first time that @entity35 film producers have rewritten history to the detriment of @entity50			1
in the 2000 film @entity154 , an @entity35 submarine intercepts a stricken @entity89 u-boat and steals an enigma code machine , helping decipher the @entity89 army 's coded messages			2
in fact it was a @entity50 ship , @entity163 , that boarded the submarine , and their achievement was not capturing the machine ( @entity168 already had three ) but finding the code books			2
the film is also set in spring 1942 , almost a year after the enigma code was actually deciphered , and seven months before the @entity35 even joined the war			0
in another re-write , the beginning of 2001 movie @entity174 features @entity178 's character almost single - handedly winning the @entity179 after @entity174 attack			1
in fact the @entity182 assault on the @entity184 base happened after the @entity187 's attacks on @entity50 , and while a few @entity35 pilots were involved in the air defence , @entity35 as a country was not involved in the war at that point			1
serial offender @entity178 also toyed with the truth in @entity194 winning @entity195 , which he starred in and directed			0
in the film six @entity35 diplomats are trying to escape from @entity199 revolutionaries who occupy their embassy			0
according to @entity178 the @entity50 refuse to offer them shelter			2
in fact the @entity50 embassy did offer them refuge , risking being attacked themselves , but were unable to find the @entity35 staff in time .			2

@entity2 was one of just two men in the monuments , fine arts and archives division to die trying to protect works of art during @entity6
he was old enough not to serve , but volunteered out of a *passion* for art
a new @entity8 film brings the heroics of the division to life
but @entity2 's name is not mentioned and the only @entity56 character is fictional , despite @entity50 giving the second - largest group of volunteers
