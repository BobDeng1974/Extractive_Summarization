@entity12 , 33 , who has served in @entity13 , was seen last week coming in and out of @entity11 in his ' civvies ' after taking photographs of mr @entity1 meeting foreign dignitaries it means the prime minister has effectively got round what appeared to be a self - imposed ban on having a so - called vanity photographer			1
@entity11 last night defended the decision on the grounds that its use of @entity12 as an in - house photographer has not cost the taxpayer a penny because he is already employed by the @entity5 @entity30 , the photographer who lost his job in the november 2010 row , was paid £ 35,000 a year from the @entity11 payroll			2
