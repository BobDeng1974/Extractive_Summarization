@entity3 have paid upwards of £ 50million for @entity16 and @entity17 , but as has been the case for the last few years , the biggest transfers have taken place away from @entity21 this summer			1

when asked whether @entity3 would be willing to pay a similar amount for a player , @entity2 said : ' it is in our capabilities			2
the club are not afraid of doing that - spending significant amounts of money in the transfer market			0
' such a move would cause @entity3 to break the £ 50m record transfer fee paid by @entity39 for @entity40 in 2011			1
@entity2 insists neither he nor the club would be fazed about being responsible for such a big deal			2
' whether it 's a record or not does n't really resonate with us , ' @entity2 said			2
' what resonates is a top , top elite player that the manager wants that is going to be a star for @entity3			0
' we are in a very strong financial position			0
we can make big signings			0
beaming : @entity16 completed his £ 31.5million move to @entity3 , something which @entity6 okayed mistakes : chief executive @entity2 failed to sign @entity13 ( left ) , @entity11 ( centre ) and @entity14 ( right ) last summer ' i get pointed in the direction of a target that the manager wants and there is an assessment of what that might cost and i 'll negotiate hard to do the best i can on the trade			1
' @entity3 are believed to be interested in signing @entity84 from @entity85 , as well as @entity6 's compatriots @entity86 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
@entity91 defender @entity90 is also on @entity6 's wish list but is understood that @entity94 ' @entity93 is not being considered as a potential signing			1
as well as experiencing troubles in the transfer market , @entity2 also took the difficult decision to sack @entity99 , who was just 10 months into a six - year contract			2
@entity2 admits it was the toughest call of his career			2
' i ca n't think of any bigger ( decision ) , ' he said			0
' it is certainly the most important role in the club by some distance and we did n't take the decision lightly			0
it was a difficult decision			0
' it was a challenging year			0
in an ideal situation , i would have worked with ( sir ) @entity114 ( @entity115 ) for a year			0
but now there is a lot more positivity			0
' targets : @entity3 are interested in @entity91 defender @entity90 ( left ) and @entity120 's @entity84 uncertain : @entity6 has not yet decided on his captain but it could be @entity123 @entity125 replacement : @entity16 will fill the big boots left by the experienced @entity127 preparations : @entity129 are pictured in full flow during pre-season training			1
