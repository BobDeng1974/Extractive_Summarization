by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 25 september 2013 as summer ends and the air turns colder , the skies are filled with birds flying south for the winter - and this year they were joined by another winged creature of a more ethereal nature			1
but the eagle that appeared over @entity8 in @entity9 this morning was not there to prey on the smaller swallows and swifts on their annual migration			1
bird - lover @entity13 , 54 , had taken a break from the office when he spotted the cloud formation that resembled a bird hovering over an industrial estate			1
swooping : the wispy cirrus cloud that resembled a bird was photographed over @entity8 in @entity9 this morning mr @entity13 , 34 , said : ' it was uncanny			1
i 'd popped outside for a quick cigarette break and looked up and there it was			0
' i ran back into the office and told everyone , but they did n't believe me			0
' one joker asked me if i was cirrus - which of course i was			1
' @entity34 clouds form at very high levels in the atmosphere - above 20,000ft			2
the extremely cold temperatures at these levels mean the clouds are made up of ice crystals , meaning they appear thin , wispy and white			0
birds including swallows and swifts usually migrate from the @entity44 in september and october , travelling thousands of miles to @entity45 , @entity46 and the @entity48 sub-continent			2
they can travel more than 200 miles in a day at a maximum flight speed of 17 - 22mph			0
icarus wings : the ' bird ' appeared to be on a final descent like the figure from @entity56 legends who died when the wax holding together his home - made wings melted when he flew too close to the sun flight of fancy : @entity13 rushed back to the office to tell his colleagues - many of whom did not believe him the bird - shaped cloud was just one of several amazing formations that have been spotted by keen photographers and cloud - spotters			1
clouds shaped like continents have been seen in recent months , as have others looking like animals such as dolphins			0
thanks to smartphones , more people are able to snap the beautiful images before they disappear			0
meanwhile , flocks of birds are also known to form themselves into cloud - like formations			1
the annual murmuration of starlings in the skies over @entity86 involves thousands of the birds taking to wing to perform a mating ritual			0
in the display that only occurs during winter months , the starlings use their amazing sense of spatial awareness to fly in a way that deflects predators			2
flock : a murmuration of starlings over @entity98 in the @entity86 borders in november 2011 @entity101 drift : a cloud looking like the @entity44 , left , spotted over @entity103 in may 2009 and , right , a cloud that resembled @entity45 seen over @entity105 in @entity106 in july this year @entity107 dive : this cloud resembling a dolphin was snapped by two men driving a white van along the @entity113 in @entity114 in january this year			0

@entity13 , 54 , spots swallow - shaped cirrus cloud over industrial estate
