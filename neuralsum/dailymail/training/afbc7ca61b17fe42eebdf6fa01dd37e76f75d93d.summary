rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick			0
design : the leaked ' sketch ' suggests that the @entity29 will be similar in design to the @entity59 2 , with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges			1
@entity86 : the image differs from the smaller tablet however , because of grilles on the top of the shell , which suggest the device will include stereo speakers , as rumoured			2

the source said that initial testing for the @entity29 was stopped in the summer and @entity5 ’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet			1
the sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the @entity59 2 in design , with rounded corners and the same standby button , rear camera , microphone and volume buttons placement			1
however , seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound , there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell			0
@entity142 magazine @entity140 claimed in december that the @entity29 will also feature a much faster a9 processor and is set to launch between april and june			0
by comparison , the @entity59 2 ( pictured ) is 9.4 inches x 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches ( 240 mm x 169.5 mm x 6.1 mm )			1
sources have suggested different launch times for the @entity29 , but the general consensus is that the supersized tablet may make its debut before the summer a leaked photo of a sketch ( pictured ) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a @entity42 factory , where @entity154 are made , also suggests that the rumours of an ‘ @entity29 ’ with a 12.2 inch screen , are true @entity157 and other publications reported that @entity5 was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015 , while a recent report from @entity161 said the @entity163 firm had postponed mass production of the larger ipad from december 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the @entity72 and 6 @entity29 launch			1
these designs showed the gadget as just 7mm thick , but the size of the screen is uncertain , with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches			2
the first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the @entity72 was impacting on @entity4 usage			2

the @entity59 2 has a 9.7 - inch display , while the @entity4 is rumoured to have a 12.2 - inch @entity195 would put the @entity29 on par with @entity107 's @entity106 , which launched last february ( pictured ) the @entity29 is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger , dwarfing the @entity198 with its 7.9inch screen ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) with a 9.7 inch screen a study by @entity201 - an app that lets users save webpages , videos and other content for reading - recently found that people who upgraded to an @entity72 6 plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before			1
it analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app , and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an @entity72 5 , @entity215 and @entity216 and those who now own an @entity218			0
it also looked at the use of tablets by the same people			0
a survey comparing the before - and - after behaviour of @entity72 and @entity4 users revealed that people with an @entity216 use their phone 55 % of the time , but this increases to 72 % for the @entity72 and 80 % for the @entity72 - both at the detriment of the @entity4 , perhaps explaining why @entity230 is planning a larger one @entity201 also saw users with both an @entity72 and an @entity4 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity233			2
those with the @entity72 ( centre ) opened 33 % more articles and videos inside @entity201 than they did with a @entity216 ( left ) , and those with a @entity238 ( right ) opened 65 % more items than before the @entity72 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through september and into early october , while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent			0
@entity5 's cheaper @entity216 and 5c handsets made up the rest of the sales			2
following last year 's launch , the @entity216 and @entity215 accounted for 84 per cent of total @entity72 sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular			0
the skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the @entity72 are lower because @entity5 is struggling to complete orders			0

‘ the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more time you ’ll spend reading and watching on it , ’ explained the researchers in a blog post			0

@entity201 also saw that users with both an @entity72 and an @entity4 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity233			0
but , a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and @entity201 noticed that people with an @entity72 read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model			0
recent figures from @entity201 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity201 users are opting for an @entity72 as opposed to a 6 @entity29			0
