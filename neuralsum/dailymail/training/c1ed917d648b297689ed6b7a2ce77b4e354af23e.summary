by @entity0 he has been dead for 1,200 years – but only now have scientists finally identified the bones of @entity4			1
after 26 years of research , @entity6 scientists are satisfied that bones held for centuries at @entity10 , @entity6 , are those of the king of the @entity12 , who is also known as the father of @entity14			1

1,200 years after the death of charlemagne - king of the @entity12 - ( pictured right in a stained glass window right ) scientists have confirmed that bones ( pictured left ) thought to be the emperor 's do indeed belong to him and they paint a picture of a tall , slim , older man @entity4 , @entity25 , ruled a @entity27 empire from 768 based mainly around @entity28 , @entity6 and parts of @entity30			1
called the ' @entity31 ' he united most of @entity14 for the first time since the @entity33			0
his rule spurred the @entity35 - a period of cultural and intellectual activity within the @entity37			0
both the @entity28 and @entity6 monarchies considered their kingdoms to be descendants of @entity4 's empire			1
although he could not write , he spoke @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			0
he was 6ft 4in - a monstrous height for the period , which has been confirmed by measurement of his skeleton			1
oddly , his father was known as @entity52 and was around 5ft tall			0
@entity4 's first campaign came at the age of 27 , when the @entity55 sought his aid in repelling the @entity57 of @entity30			0
he conquered them in the field and took the crown of @entity61 as his own			0
from his capital of @entity10 in modern - day @entity6 , @entity4 went on to fight 53 campaigns , most of which he led himself			1
he defended a @entity68 from @entity69 , often beheading thousands in a single day			0
he is thought to have died aged 72 from a fever , but study of the ancient bones has not confirmed this			0
a total of 94 bones and fragments were analysed from the cathedral and are believed to belong to the founder of the @entity79			1
the sarcophagus holding the remains was secretly opened in 1988 and there were high hopes that the bones belonged to @entity14 ’s first emperor @entity88 , @entity6 newspaper , @entity80 reported			1
professor @entity89 , of the @entity90 , @entity91 , who was among the scientists studying the remains , said : ‘ thanks to the results from 1988 up until today , we can say with great likelihood that we are dealing with the skeleton of @entity4			2
’ the team of researchers studied the dimensions of the thigh , shin and upper arm bones to get an idea of the man ’s height and build – which match the descriptions of the emperor			1
the man now confirmed to be @entity4 , was six feet tall ( 1.84metres ) weighed around 12stone 3lbs ( 78kg ) and had a slim build			0
historians have previously estimated the emperor ’s height to be between 1.79metres and 1.92metres tall			2
one @entity116 biographer , einhard the @entity89 , wrote that @entity4 walked with a limp in his later years , which the scientists now think could be true			2
they found that the skeleton ’s kneecap and heel bones had deposits that would indicate an injury of some sort			2
but they did n’t find any new evidence to suggest that he died of pneumonia – or other clues about his later health – which would back up other accounts			0

most of the skeleton was discovered in the king ’s golden tomb , while a few fragments of his skull were collected from inside a bust of the late emperor			1
