children are known for their brutal honesty and it 's thanks to an innocent but tactless comment from her young son that a mother lost 13 stone			1
mother - of - two @entity9 , 32 , from @entity11 , tipped the scales at 23st and was flabbergasted when her eight - year - old , @entity14 , asked her why she was so fat			2

until that moment , she had n't realised how out of control her weight had got			0
now , just one year later , @entity9 has dropped down to a healthy 10st , after following a strict diet and a regular exercise routine			1
