the court had heard from medical experts that the force used to break @entity5 's ribs was similar to that seen in a car crash or a fall from a tall building			2
as well as a ' sustained and forceful attack ' on @entity5 hours before she died , the jury was told that @entity9 also slammed the tot ’s head against a bedroom wall damaging the plaster three weeks previously - claiming he hit the wall because he was trying to kill a spider			1
seven months before she died , @entity5 was found with a bruised neck which @entity9 said was caused when she banged her head on a sink			1
paramedics were called on february 8 when ms @entity11 found @entity5 was not breathing when she returned from work at @entity44			1

' the injuries indicated she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault that had occurred within hours of her admission to hospital			0
' mr @entity66 had told the court : ' the couple ’s relationship was generally good but sometimes he would complain he felt sidelined and she gave too much to @entity5			0
' ' this murder was a forceful and sustained attack on a defenceless three - year - old girl			1
' det supt @entity74 @entity9 , an unemployed @entity75 , told police the girl was full of energy and he found it hard to deal with her demands while trainee nurse @entity81 said ' he at times mentioned that i perhaps smothered her			2
' @entity5 ’s mother had gone to work on the day her daughter died but @entity9 failed to take @entity5 to nursery where staff described her as ' bright ' and a ' confident , bubbly little girl '			1

@entity98 for clues : a forensics officer enters the @entity102 home of @entity5			0
scientific evidence suggests that her head was banged off a wall in the main bedroom of the house a pathologist reported that the bruises to @entity5 ’s head were ' typical of non-accidental injuries ' and bruising in and behind the left ear ' suggested impact from a hard object with a straight linear surface			2
' he went on : ' other bruises could have been caused by kicks , slaps or punches			0
' all the bruises had been caused within 24 hours of her death			0
medical experts found scar tissue on the brain indicating a three - week - old injury and four rib fractures , one of which was about three weeks old			2
the other three fresh breaks had been caused by ' squeezing or compression '			0

the court was told that @entity9 had a previous conviction for sexual assault against a 13 - year - old girl in august , 2005 @entity141 , defending , said the attack on @entity5 was not pre-meditated and although he admitted there were as number of impacts the court could ' never be sure in this case that there was an intention to kill			1
' judge justice @entity149 , heard pre-sentence submissions from both barristers who agreed that @entity9 will receive a life sentence with a minimum term to be fixed by the judge			1
both lawyers also agreed the judge 's starting point for fixing the minimum term was 15 years but she could increase this by taking into account aggravating factors			1
mr @entity66 said these factors should include the vulnerability of the victim , the abuse of a position of trust , the previous violence towards @entity5 , the fact he tried to blame his partner for the murder and his previous conviction			2
life sentence : @entity9 will be sentenced at @entity14 , pictured , tomorrow after the verdict investigating officer @entity173 @entity74 said : ' this murder was a forceful and sustained attack on a defenceless three - year - old girl			1
