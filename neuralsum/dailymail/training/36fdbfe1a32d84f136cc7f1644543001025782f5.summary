by @entity0 while relations between @entity3 and @entity4 may have sunk below basic standards of civility , the teams are at least united by one common issue – do they have a specialist spinner good enough to play in the next test ? @entity4 , in particular , may reflect with some regret on how they lacked the confidence to select a frontline slow bowler to exploit helpful conditions in the series opener at @entity16			1
after predictions of rain and swing at the @entity22 bowlers ’ favourite venue , they were instead greeted by baking sunshine and a groundsman apologising for producing the type of flat track more readily found in @entity28 than @entity29			2
negative spin : @entity31 ( centre ) is @entity4 's best slow bowler but has a poor record away from home it was only when a few clouds appeared for a mere hour or so on the last morning that we saw significant ball movement and an @entity41 batting wobble			1
then the sun reappeared and the game resumed on its ponderous path to an inevitable draw			2
the pace bowlers on both sides toiled manfully in the circumstances , but if this is what we can expect for the rest of the series – and the forecast is for a heatwave in the opening days at @entity56 – then just imagine the havoc that could be wreaked by a skilled spinner			2
it is fair to ask how the land of twirlers and tweakers and doyens of the doosra can find itself in the same predicament as @entity3 in scratching around for such a man ? how can the country that regularly used to field an attack of four spin bowlers now find itself unable to select even one of them to help the seamers ? well , there is one actually			2
his name is @entity31 and he reached 100 test wickets quicker than any bowler in @entity41 history			1
turning it on : @entity31 reached 100 test wickets faster than any other @entity41 bowler in history the 27 - year - old has nine five - fors from only @entity84 , and boasts an impressive array of variations beyond his stock off - spinner			1
he can even bowl the carrom ball , which is flicked out between the thumb and a bent middle finger ( anyone who has played the @entity41 board game of the same name will understand why it is so called )			1
there ’s just one problem			0
only nine of his 104 test wickets were taken away from the dustbowls of @entity4			1
net gain : @entity31 , pictured in practice ahead of the first test , is surely worth a place in @entity4 's team for @entity106 's he was selected for just one of the four tests that @entity4 played in @entity109 and @entity110 last winter , when he went wicketless at @entity111 while conceding 108 runs			1
while he has taken his wickets at 28.5 runs apiece overall , his figures are severely tarnished by a bowling average of 75 away from home			1
hence the concerns over selecting him in @entity3			0
but there is no doubt he is the best that @entity4 have got			0
and with the prospect of a long hot summer on the cards and six left - handers in the @entity22 team who wo n’t like the ball spinning away from their bat , it is surely time to change tack			0
@entity4 ’s batsman have shown they can be comfortable in these conditions , and it is encouraging that the bulk of the runs at @entity16 came from unheralded sources like the opener @entity140 rather than the acknowledged stars @entity141 and @entity143			0
meanwhile the seam bowlers , while a little slower than their @entity22 counterparts and even less capable of taking the last wicket , were at least able to bowl some probing lines and lengths as well as extracting a little ball movement			0
@entity151 and @entity152 , in particular , showed in the first innings that they can make inroads into this @entity22 batting line - up			0
all they needed was a proper spinner to put on a different type of pressure at the other end			0
although the @entity41 camp has been quick to justify its selection in the first test , and there are signs they may remain loyal to same xi for now , it would be foolish to delay @entity31 ’s introduction for too long			1
in danger : @entity31 could replace @entity171 ( left ) or @entity172 ( right ) - or @entity4 could play two spinners @entity31 's test bowling record : tests : 19 wickets : 104 best bowling ( inns ) : 7/103 best bowling ( match ) : 12/85 average : 28.50 5wkt inns : 9 10wkt match : 2 the all - rounder @entity171 , whose innocuous up - and - down medium pacers only took up 10 out of the 145 overs @entity4 bowled at @entity16 , is the obvious candidate to make way			1
such a move may seem harsh after his disciplined 65 helped see out the draw on the last day , but he offers no more with the bat than @entity31 – who can boast two test centuries and a batting average nudging 40			1
the other option would be to leave out the spinning all - rounder @entity172 , who may be a recognised top order batsman in @entity41 conditions but looked less comfortable than @entity171 when wielding the willow at @entity29			1
the great factor in his favour , however , is that his left - arm spin dovetails nicely with that of @entity31 , who turns the ball the other way			2
pitching an idea : @entity4 could go with two spinners at @entity56 , no matter what the track looks like with favourable conditions , playing the pair of them represents the best chance for @entity4 to close out a game over this long five - match series			0
they have won countless matches over the years through their tried and tested method of triggering a second innings collapse by crowding the bat with close fielders , incessant chatter and over-optimistic appealing			0
it does n’t matter if the pitch is not entirely responsive at @entity56 , or if this tactic does not yield immediate dividends			0
this is simply what @entity4 do			0
it is in their dna			0
they always do it back home and it is time to show the conviction to try it here .			2

@entity31 was the quickest @entity41 bowler to 100 test wickets
however , just nine of his 104 test wickets have been away from home
@entity31 could come in for @entity171 or @entity172
