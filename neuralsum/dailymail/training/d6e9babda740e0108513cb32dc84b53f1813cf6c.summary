the former @entity10 and @entity11 defender fears that academy players do not have a clear pathway from youth to senior football and that the money invested in state - of - the - art facilities will be of little use if top - flight managers fail to take an interest in young talent			1
@entity22 unveiled their new £ 200million @entity23 earlier this week but @entity8 , who came through @entity10 's youth ranks , is adamant that clubs must immerse their youngsters in the first - team environment , too			1

' we would sit in the first - team dressing room after laying out the shirts and shorts , waiting for the senior side to arrive			2
it was an incredible experience for us as young lads			0
i remember one trip with @entity56 , over the top of the moors to @entity59 , when @entity59 were doing well in the top flight , and listening to sir @entity61 rip into @entity62 for letting @entity63 pull off the back of him and score			0
' @entity43 would look after us			0
we were there to absorb the first - team culture			2
we were there to understand how it worked , what it meant , and i remember how big it felt for me when the first team walked into that room , even though i had been at @entity10 from the age of 11			2
to travel with the kit and be immersed in the first - team ethos was to feel part of a continuous link from youth team to @entity1 starting xi. it was an inspiration , a pathway all the way through the club			1
' @entity8 ( left ) broke into @entity10 's starting xi after being immersed in the first - team culture @entity22 chairman @entity85 speaks about the club 's plans at the launch of their new academy @entity91 has followed in @entity8 's footsteps by graduating from @entity10 's academy into the first - team @entity8 admits that things changed at @entity10 when the club left the @entity96 and moved to a new training base at @entity98 , but he maintains that the system he came through gave him the best chance of making an impact under sir @entity61			1
' academies are not about bricks and mortar , ' he wrote			0
' they are about culture and integration			0
what about a mentoring system , where a first - team player has a meal with a youth team player once a week and talks to him about standards ? should they not be pushed closer to the first - team rather than further away ?

look , an academy player in the first - team ! we lined up in the @entity31 studio excited at the thought of seeing homegrown talent in a @entity28 side			2
when he played for eight minutes , we showed the highlights of it as a special segment			0
we were seeing a rare species			0
' with every @entity1 club keen to develop their own talent as @entity153 rules hinder their ability to spend , the importance of academies has arguably never been greater			2
' @entity28 and @entity22 have built the most incredible factories , but what really counts is the people , culture and most importantly belief and risk in giving youth a chance , ' wrote @entity8			1
