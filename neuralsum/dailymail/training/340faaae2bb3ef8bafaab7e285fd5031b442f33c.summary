by @entity0 published : 11:38 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 12:34 est , 30 january 2014 an infant school has launched a new crackdown on parents who pick up their children late from school - by fining them £ 6 if they turn up more than 15 minutes late			1
@entity7 in @entity8 wants to discourage parents from treating it as a ' childcare provider ' by charging whenever it has to look after pupils outside school hours			1
but many parents are furious about the fining regime , saying it is unfair to families with multiple children and could prove ruinous to less wealthy people			1
tough : @entity7 in @entity8 is fining parents £ 6 an hour for collecting their children late the school , which is located in the @entity23 area and whose pupils go up to @entity26 , told parents in a letter last week that they would have to pay £ 6 for every hour they were late after 3.15pm			1
the announcement came soon after another @entity8 school revealed that it would charge parents £ 60 if their children turned up late in the morning			1
@entity33 imposed the fine in a tough new disciplinary drive , but parents spoke out against the move			1
one mother at @entity39 today spoke of her anger at the policy , saying : ' i found the letter in my four - year - old son 's bag			0
i 'm not sure that was the best way to inform parents			1
' @entity23 is not a rich place			0
people on benefits might not be able to pay the fines and then what are they going to do ? ' i have children in three different schools across @entity8 , i ca n't be in all those places at the same time and sometimes i 'll be delayed			1
' letter : a copy of the note sent to all parents by the school last week outlining the policy interim headmistress @entity63 said that parents could be fined even if they arrived just five minutes later than the designated time , but insisted that no one would be penalised if they had a valid reason for their delay			1
in a statement , the school said : ' the letter which we sent out is not new			0
it has been in place since 2011			0
' all parents have seen it in the school prospectus and it is on our website			1
' in september the previous headteacher reminded parents of the policy in her newsletter which was sent home in book bags - this is our standard practice			1
' unfortunately it is becoming increasingly frequent that some parents are collecting children late from school			1
' may we remind you that school finish time is 3pm daily and you should be at school prompt to collect your child at this time			1
' we understand that occasionally emergencies do arise and appreciate this can lead to the late collection of children			0
' if you have a genuine emergency and know you will be late collecting your child , it is essential you let the school know			0
' however , for those parents who collect their child late from school without giving a valid reason , we will be introducing a childcare charge in line with other childcare providers , of £ 6 per hour if your child remains in school after 3.15pm			1
' this charge will be collected by the school office on the day			0
' ' in january a reminder of this was sent out			0
we are always sympathetic to our families and will support them in any way we can if we are notified of any pick - up problem			0
obviously in these cases no charges would be raised			0
' however , there have been occasions where parents have been exceptionally late with no reason given and we have been unable to contact them			2
' @entity123 , chairman of the @entity124 , said fining parents was the wrong way to address the issue			2
he said : ' the fines for taking children out of school for holidays - that 's fine			0
but the idea of fining parents £ 6 at the end of the day is completely new to me			2
' fines should only be issued in very , very extreme circumstances and as a total last resort			0
' schools are communities of families and this will break the relationship between the school and the parents			2
this undermines that sense of community that the school needs			0
' i have been in that situation when you 're waiting at the end of the day for parents to collect their children			2
i got very annoyed , but if it 's a persistent thing you should contact social services			0
' @entity39 may even find that the plan to curb tardiness could backfire - in one well - known case , detailed in the 2005 best - seller @entity161 , it was found that fining parents for being late only encouraged them to be later			2
the counter-intuitive result came because parents no longer felt guilty about being late picking their children up if they were able to ' buy off ' their guilt with a small fine .			2

@entity7 in @entity8 has imposed tough regime
they say they should not have to provide childcare for pupils after hours
but parents say it is *unrealistic* to expect them always to turn up on time
