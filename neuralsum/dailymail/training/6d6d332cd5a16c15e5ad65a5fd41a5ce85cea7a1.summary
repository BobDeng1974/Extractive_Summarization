for years , @entity0 has been driving around the world providing @entity3 images for people to explore when using @entity5			1
but a new challenger could be on the scene , as cars owned by @entity9 been spotted with similar camera equipment on their roofs			0
while not confirmed , some think it may be that @entity9 is planning its own rival to @entity3 - or even testing self - driving car technology			1
scroll down for a video of a similar car spotted last year a car with cameras on it ( shown ) was spotted driving around @entity21			1
the @entity22 confirmed the car was registered to @entity9			1
some have speculated it could be getting images for a @entity3 rival the @entity29 van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog @entity32 in @entity21			1
they apparently asked the driver what he was doing , but he refused to give an answer			0
the head of self - driving cars for @entity0 expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			2
@entity43 says the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity0 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			0
but mr @entity43 would n't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse , saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly			0
he told reporters last month at the @entity54 in @entity55 that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars			0
but a video from last year shows a similar car , which was known to be an unmarked self - driving @entity29 caravan			2
the latest car seems to have some sort of camera system on the top , somewhat similar to the camera system on top of @entity0 ’s @entity3 car			0
it could also be a camera system for a self - driving car			2
according to 9to5mac , the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) confirmed the vehicle was leased to @entity9			2
with 12 cameras on top of the car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity0 ’s @entity3			2
‘ too many cameras , ’ said technology analyst @entity77 , speaking to @entity78			0
‘ it has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle			0
’ @entity9 ditched @entity5 as the default navigation app on @entity86 devices in 2012 in favour of @entity88			1
but it has lacked a @entity3 function since then like @entity5			1
shown is one of their cars in @entity93 @entity0 launched its @entity3 technology in 2007 , and has considerably refined the technology since then ( screenshot near @entity97 in @entity98 shown ) the would lend itself to the self - driving car theory			1
‘ unfortunately for that theory , only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles , and @entity9 is n’t one of them , ’ said 9to5mac			0
‘ this brings us back to a much more likely conclusion : @entity9 is preparing to take on @entity0 ’s @entity3 with a similar offering in its own maps software			0
’ they said it might features as part of the @entity115 upgrate due later this year , although it would likely begin only with select cities such as @entity117 and @entity21			0
this would plug a noticeable hole in @entity88 , which has been sorely missing @entity3 ever since @entity9 made it the default maps app for @entity121			1
these cars would therefore signify a move to take on @entity0 at their own @entity3 game			0
when contacted by @entity125 , @entity9 declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was			1
@entity9 ditched @entity5 ( left ) as the default navigation app on @entity86 devices in 2012 in favour of their own @entity88 ( right ) , but it has lacked the @entity3 functionality since then others have said the vehicle may be testing self - driving technology , again like @entity0 has been doing ( @entity0 's self - driving car shown )			1
@entity9 has so far declined to comment on the appearance of the car			2
