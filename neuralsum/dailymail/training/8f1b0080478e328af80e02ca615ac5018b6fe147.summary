labour frontbenchers mocked @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 sitting alongside mr @entity2 as he described their plan as ‘ intrusive ’			1
mr @entity10 , the @entity4 ’ former @entity13 spokesman and now @entity14 , has been pushing for a mansion tax ever since gaining office			1
@entity2 humiliated his @entity4 colleagues @entity11 ( left ) , @entity9 ( right ) and @entity10 by brutally dismissing their hopes for a mansion tax in his @entity19 today @entity20 : deputy prime minister @entity9 pulls a face as @entity2 dashes the @entity4 hopes of introducing a ' mansion tax ' mocking : labour front benchers laugh as @entity9 pulls faces in response to @entity2 's @entity19 the plan would see an annual levy of 1 per cent on homes worth more than £ 2million – penalising pensioners who have lived in their house for years			1
earlier in the year , he was still arguing for the plan , saying : ‘ a mansion tax is still very much on the agenda – it is a very good idea			1
‘ it is good for two reasons			0
it would constitute a tax on wealth rather than income , which we believe to be right , and also in economic terms it creates the right sort of incentives for the property market			2
’ but mr @entity2 revealed crushingly yesterday that mr @entity10 had failed to argue the @entity4 case in @entity47			2
having a field day : labour frontbenchers pointed at @entity4 cabinet ministers and made fun of them as mr @entity2 branded their mansion tax plan as ' intrusive ' he said it would require a huge revaluation of homes , and would raise little money anyway			1
‘ to make sure the deficit reduction remains fair , we need to raise more , ’ he told @entity57			0
‘ we ’ve already raised stamp duty on multi-million - pound homes and next week we will publish the legislation to stop the richest avoiding stamp duty			0
‘ but we wo n’t introduce a new tax on property			0
this would require a revaluation of hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
‘ in my view it would be intrusive , expensive to levy , raise little and the temptation for future @entity72 to bring ever more homes into its net would be irresistible			0
’ the plan would see an annual levy on homes worth more than £ 2million like this one - penalising pensioners who have lived in their house for years mr @entity10 told @entity81 he was disappointed to have lost the battle over a mansion tax – but said it was part of a ‘ very sensible compromise ’			1
‘ the changes that have been introduced on pension tax are substantial , ’ he said			0
‘ there was a trade - off within the @entity5			0
the @entity4 would clearly liked to have done much more in terms of the top end of the scale of income and wealth ; we reached a compromise with the conservatives on that			2
’ united front ? @entity11 and @entity2 prior to the @entity19			2
