it 's a pain locking a bike when popping into a shop for a few minutes – especially when you know you ’ll be fumbling for your keys minutes later			0
but the key is set to become a thing of the past now that designers have created a @entity10 padlock that can be unlocked simply by hovering a smartphone nearby			1
the device allows people to share a bike , for example , protected by the lock to work the ‘ @entity35 ’ lock , a user must press the shackle when they and their phone are nearby			1
‘ @entity23 wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone			2
if the phone is within a few feet , @entity35 will instantly unlock so you can be on your way			0
no need to launch an app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse , ’ the company wrote on @entity40			2
it uses signals sent via @entity10 to a smartphone to identify the owner of the lock and in this way will also allow people to share their lock – so two people could access one bike , for example , either temporarily or permanently			1
@entity63 : the @entity23 lock ( pictured in pieces ) it is made from hardened steel and boron and has a long - life battery that lasts for a year with continuous use no more fumbling for keys : ‘ @entity23 wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone			1
if the phone is within a few feet , ( illustrated ) @entity23 will instantly unlock so you can be on your way			2
no need to launch an app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse , ’ the company said the @entity23 padlock connects via @entity10 with an @entity17 or @entity19 app to automatically identify the owner of the lock			1
to unlock @entity23 , users simply have to press the shackle			1
it wakes up and searches for a phone and if it senses the handset is within a few feet , it instantly unlocks so users do n’t even have to take their phone out of their pocket			0
the app allows instant and secure sharing so users can choose to let another person temporarily or permanently access their bike – or whatever the padlock is protecting			0
it can also be opened if a user learns a sequence of clicks – so it works a little like a combination lock without numbers			1
@entity104 - based design company @entity103 created the smart padlock to solve the problems associated with traditional padlocks and keys , which are easy to lose , can be stolen and are hard to share			2
the device weighs just over eight ounces ( 227 grams ) and is designed to be used with a cable for bikes , as well as securing sheds			0
it is made from hardened steel and boron and has a long - life battery that promises to last for a year with continuous use			1
if a user ’s phone , or the lock ’s battery dies , they will be able to use ‘ quick click ’ technology to access the lock , allowing them to key in a sequence of pre-determined clicks manually using the shackle			1
co-founder of the company , @entity133 , 35 , said : ' @entity23 is roughly the same size as a traditional padlock			2
secure : the device weighs just over eight ounces ( 225grams ) and can be used with a cable for bikes , as well as securing sheds ( illustrated ) smart : the lock will send signals via @entity10 to a smartphone to identify the owner of the lock and in this way also allows people to share their lock – so two people can access one bike , for example ( pictured ) ' it is 3.3 inches ( 9cm ) tall and 2.2 inches ( 6cm ) wide and weighs about eight ounces			1
' there is no interference with other @entity10 devices			2
@entity35 does n't unlock until you wake it up			0
it wo n't ever unlock on its own			0
’ the firm is currently raising funding on @entity40 and has smashed its $ 100,000 ( £ 62,000 ) target , pulling in over $ 500,000 ( £ 310,106 )			0
the lock is available to pre-order for $ 59 ( £ 37 ) with a shipping date in february , but will retail for around $ 89 ( £ 55 )			1
@entity35 's creators claim their smart lock is secure			0
it can only be unlocked when a user 's smartphone is hovered within feet of the device			0
a user can turn off the auto - unlock feature so it will not be accidentally unlocked if they are nearby			2
it uses @entity177 , which contains the highest level of security , according to the firm			0
@entity10 uses a 128 - bit @entity182 encryption algorithm and the designers have added their own @entity185 technology and cryptographic key exchange protocol to prevent the device being hacked			1
the main threats come in the way of ' traditional theft ' as a thief could steal a smartphone and use it to unlock a bike , for example			0
the lock is also designed to be shared , meaning people must choose their friends wisely or risk their valuables being stolen , despite the smart padlock .			0
