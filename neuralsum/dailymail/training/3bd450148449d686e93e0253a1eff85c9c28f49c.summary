by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:11 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:15 est , 26 december 2013 @entity3 has warned newspapers to sign up to his plan for state - backed regulation of the @entity7 or risk a crackdown from a less ' liberal ' government in the future			1
the prime minister said if the @entity7 continues to make the ' mistake ' of refusing to do so , a future ' illiberal ' government may impose tougher restrictions			1
his stance is in stark contrast to culture secretary @entity17 , who recently indicated nothing would happen if the @entity7 refused to sign			1
@entity19 contrast : prime minister @entity3 ( left ) and culture secretary @entity17 ( right ) do not seem to have been singing from the same hymn sheet on press regulation most national newspapers have refused to sign up to the politicians ' new system of press regulation underpinned by @entity27 , over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of press freedom			1
they have put forward their own proposal for a tough new regulator , independent of politicians , which they say meets @entity37 's recommendations			2
speaking to @entity38 , mr @entity3 said he wanted to see newspapers be ' compliant ' with the politicians ' charter			0
' i believe there 's a great opportunity here to put this difficult and painful issue to bed , ' he said			0
' if the @entity7 set up their regulator i hope , in time , they will make that regulator compliant with – to then seek recognition under – the charter recognition body			1
' if that then happens , we 'll have in place a system that i think will settle this issue because we would have achieved what @entity37 wanted which is independent self - regulation by the @entity7			1
' most national newspapers have put forward their own proposal for a tough new regulator , independent of politicians , which they say meets @entity37 's recommendations ( pictured ) he said politicians have given the press ' an opportunity to put this issue to bed i would think for 50 to 100 years if you want to '			0
' now , if you choose to set up your self - regulator but say " we 're not going to seek recognition " , that is your choice , ' he said			0
' personally i think that is a mistake because you 're missing the opportunity to settle this and you 're risking that some future , less liberal , less enlightened government at the time of the next press crisis will hitch you with some hideous statutory regulation which i prevented			2
' mr @entity3 added : ' if you choose to set up your body but not seek recognition , that is your decision			0
' we 've done our bit to put this in place , i think you 're at risk in the future but it 's your choice			2
' i find it hard to understand what is it in the process of seeking recognition that sends you into such a problematic state , but that 's for you to decide			0
' @entity102 mp @entity101 said : ' i think this proposed @entity27 is indefensible and it 's bang out of order to try to defend it on the basis a future government might do something even more indefensible			2
' @entity7 in this country has n't been forced to publish under licence for centuries and it would be a massive black mark against this government if they push ahead with this folly			1
' @entity115 , the chief executive of @entity116 , said : ' the @entity27 already steps over a red line – the threat that it could be replaced by something even worse does n't make it acceptable			0
' this is a point of fundamental principle and the press should stick to their guns			0
