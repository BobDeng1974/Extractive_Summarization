@entity0 hopes that @entity2 ' first dual - contracted players could be signed up during the next ' three or four weeks '			1
a number of @entity5 stars are set to pen deals that will be funded by the @entity7 and @entity2 ' four professional regional teams			1
the initiative is part of a new six - year agreement recently thrashed out between the @entity7 and regions following months of often bitter in - fighting			2
@entity2 coach @entity0 hopes the first dual contracts will be signed in the next ' three or four ' weeks an annual pot of Â£ 3.3million will fund national player contracts , with the @entity7 making a 60 per cent contribution and regions 40 per cent			1
@entity2 captain @entity17 has already been moved from a central contract to a dual one , while colleagues who sign dual deals could include the likes of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
' we have put a list together and we have to present that to the @entity31 ( professional @entity32 ) about potential players we are interested in , ' @entity2 coach @entity0 said			2
' we have got a finite amount of money			0
hopefully , we can get between 10 and 15 players to be on those dual contracts and for the players to be excited about being on them			1
' the money is there , it is coming from the same pot , it 's just how it 's being spread out			0
hopefully , in the next three or four weeks we will get players signed on a national dual contract			1
' for them , they will have the certainty of where they are going to be the next two or three years or whatever , and what is associated with having a dual contract			1
' the players we are looking at for dual contracts are already in contract			1
they are already signed up to their clubs , so they are fairly secure			0
' @entity2 captain @entity17 has been moved to a dual contract from a central one wales have suffered more than most during recent seasons with leading players - individuals such as @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 - opting to ply their trade in @entity66 and @entity67			1
but @entity0 is confident that the introduction of dual contracts could generate a reverse of that market trend			1
' i can understand why players want to go to @entity66 for a short period and experience life out there - two or three seasons , ' he added			2
' money has been the driving factor , but then they have realised that playing in a good side and being happy , hopefully have good coaching and longevity of career , that a lot of other factors come into play about making those decisions			0
' i think we will hopefully see , over the next couple of seasons , a number of players returning from @entity66			2
' we are limited by the amount of money we have got			0
we only have a finite amount , and possibly , the number will go down			0
' most rugby contracts , unfortunately , do n't tend to go down , they tend to go up , so we will probably end up with less players on dual contracts			1
@entity23 ( centre ) is one of a number of players in line for a new dual contract ' but you never know , with new tv deals and sponsorship , there might be more money to go into that pot to attract players			1
' we have got to be aware of that over the next few weeks , when we do those dual contracts , to potentially leave some money there to try and attract one or two players back from overseas next season			1
' @entity0 , meanwhile , revealed on wednesday that @entity2 ' preparations for the @entity117 next year are set to include training camps in @entity119 and @entity120			2
@entity0 confirmed the plans during the launch of a new partnership between the @entity7 and @entity125 @entity124 that will see cars provided to coaches , players and staff until 2018			0
the camps are set to take place ahead of @entity2 ' @entity117 warm - up games next summer			0
' we have got a high - altitude camp in @entity119 , which is being planned , and we are doing a warm weather camp in @entity120 , ' he said			0
' i think we have got 12 - 14 days in @entity119			0
we are going to sleep high , train low , going up by cable car to sleep			0
' we have had that planning in place for the last three months or so and have prepared for all that			0
' the thing with the altitude training is not so much that you train at it , it 's just the physiological benefits you get from it			0
' the challenge is doing that in @entity119 at altitude and also at 45 - 50 degrees centigrade in @entity120			0
' under the deal with @entity125 , a total of 89 new cars will be distributed throughout the @entity7 's workforce , including to @entity0 and his coaching assistants @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 .			2

first dual contracts could be signed in next ' three or four weeks '
aim is to *prevent* @entity7 talent going to play in @entity67 and @entity66
@entity2 captain @entity17 is already on a dual contract
@entity23 and @entity26 among those in line for a new deal
