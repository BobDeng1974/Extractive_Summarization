@entity0 has a knack for niggle when it comes to @entity4 but is focusing only on upsetting the odds when it comes to @entity8 ’s one - day future			1
a combination of five defeats in six limited - overs series , injuries to key men and the fact that not a single @entity15 made the @entity17 ’s one - day team of the year does not bode well			2
however , @entity0 - who got under the skin of both @entity19 and @entity20 in past skirmishes - is adamant they can launch a genuine bid for a first 50 - over @entity24 , starting on their seven - match tour of @entity4 later this month			1
@entity0 believes @entity8 can win next year 's @entity24 to be held in @entity27 and @entity28 ‘ there ’s not an expectation for us to do well , which could work out for us , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ we know we have the squad of players to do really good things and a lot of young , exciting players			0
not a lot of people have seen what they can do yet			0
again , that could play into our hands			0
’ one man who believes @entity0 ’s optimism is misplaced is @entity44 legend @entity43			0
he was at @entity45 on friday to launch his autobiography and , when asked if @entity8 had a chance to lift the @entity24 - which begins on february 14 in @entity27 and @entity28 - said : ‘ anything is possible in this sport but going by current form i do n’t think @entity8 will be that competitive			1
’ @entity0 ( right ) will be part of the @entity8 squad touring @entity4 in november @entity54 , the specialist bank and asset manager , is the title sponsor of test match cricket in @entity8			2
