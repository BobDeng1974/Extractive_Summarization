by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 09:29 est , 19 october 2012 a teenager who died in a car accident may have crashed because she was concentrating too hard on her new satnav , an inquest was told yesterday			1
@entity6 - @entity5 , 17 , was using the @entity8 device for the first time on a trip to the seaside with friends			1
it gave no warning of a crossroads and – believing she had the right of way – she drove straight on without slowing down			2
killed : @entity6 - @entity5 had passed her driving test a month before she died in may this year a van smashed into the side of her car , killing her instantly			1
@entity23 was driving a @entity24 that her parents had bought her after she had passed her driving test at the first attempt a few weeks earlier			2
on the day of the crash – may 31 – she told them she was going to take two friends to a swimming pool near her home in @entity32			1
instead the trio went on a 60 - mile trip to @entity35 and on to the resort of @entity37			1
on the way home the satnav did not indicate that the minor road she was on was about to cross a main road			2
@entity45 , who was driving the van that hit her on the crossroads , told the inquest : ‘ out of the corner of my eye i saw something black			1
there was nowhere i could go , i collided straight into the side of the car			1
’ driving conditions were good and there was no evidence either vehicle was breaking the speed limit			2
scene : the crossroads where @entity23 's @entity24 was hit by a van , killing her and injuring her two friends @entity63 , an accident investigator , followed the route taken by @entity23 using the same satnav and concluded the student ’s over-reliance on the device may have been a factor			1
‘ the road signs are there , ’ he said			0
‘ they are clearly visible			0
why they were n’t seen or observed is not possible to comment on			0
‘ the satnav system they were using is telling you the next place where you are required to make an adjustment is a quarter of a mile further on			0
it is common to all satnav devices i have examined ; if you are travelling and the road is straight on at a crossroads , a satnav will give you no indication			0
‘ i think unwittingly she followed the satnav religiously and it lulled them into a false sense of the belief they had right of way at this junction			0
’ @entity23 ’s friends , @entity95 and @entity96 , were both injured in the accident			2
@entity95 said @entity23 was a careful driver			0
she told how she was knocked out in the crash , adding : ‘ i remember waking up and seeing @entity6 ’s face			0
she did n’t speak , she was n’t moving			0
’ @entity100 , @entity35 assistant deputy coroner , recorded a verdict of accidental death , saying it was impossible to say why @entity6 had not stopped at the crossroads			0
@entity8 refused to comment .			1
