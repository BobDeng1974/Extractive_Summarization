a card - playing pair of @entity2 doctors have attacked a ban for cheating with cough signals - saying one of them simply had asthma			1
world champions @entity8 and @entity10 were condemned by the @entity11 last month for a scam which closely resembled the ' coughing code ' of infamous @entity14 winner @entity16			1
but gynaecologist dr @entity10 attacked the ban - which has rocked the sedate world of bridge - and insisted : ' i have asthma , so of course i cough a lot '			1
burning their bridges : @entity10 , 71 ( left ) and @entity8 , 61 ( right ) were found guilty of cheating at the normally sedate card game , but dr @entity10 said he has asthma and vowed to challenge the decision dr @entity10 was speaking to @entity2 newspaper @entity28 after the pair were banned from playing as a team for life and as individuals for 10 years by the @entity33 of the @entity11			1
he said the ban was ' an impudence ' , adding : ' in 10 years i could already be as dead as a mouse			1
' he and @entity39 , 61 - both of whom vehemently denied the claims from the start - are planning to challenge the ban , the newspaper reported			1
the pair , known as the @entity2 doctors , triumphed for @entity2 last september at the world bridge championships in @entity47 , @entity48			2
but suspicions were raised about their frequent coughing during matches by @entity53 player @entity52 , who made a complaint to the @entity11			0
hidden cameras were installed which led to a two - day disciplinary hearing last month in @entity57 , @entity58			2
high drama : the men playing against their @entity53 competitors in the @entity63 final the doctors did not appear at the hearing , but sent a number of letters challenging its legitimacy			2
the eyes of the bridge world were on the hearing as the panel heard evidence from opponents , @entity76 footage and experts that the pair had coughed whenever they were weak in a certain suit			0
' the evidence showed that there was a clear pattern in the way that @entity8 and @entity10 communicated information to each other , ' the panel 's report said			1
' on each and every occasion when one of them held a shortage in a suit , this was communicated by coughing			0
this coughing took place when it was that player 's turn to bid			0
' the number of coughs indicated in which suit there was a shortage			0
if there was no shortage there was no coughing			0
' partners in top - level bridge games , where pairs must work in isolation but also as a team , have footboards between them under their tables and are not allowed to look at each other , said @entity116 from the @entity117			0
million pound fraud : major @entity16 and his wife @entity120 cheated at a game on national television and as @entity123 of the game states : ' the gravest possible offence is for a partnership to exchange information through prearranged methods of communication			2
' the pair were stripped of their title and the world champions were named as the @entity53 runners - up instead			0
they were also made to pay the costs of the hearing against them			0
the case has striking similarities to that of ' coughing major ' @entity16 who , in 2003 , was found guilty of cheating in the tv game show @entity142 ? he , his wife @entity120 and accomplice @entity144 were convicted of fraud after the pair communicated answers to him from the audience by coughing on national television .			1

@entity8 , 61 , and @entity10 , 71 , were banned for 10 years
disciplinary *commission* found they communicated using cough signals
case bears similarities to that of @entity142 winner @entity16
but dr @entity10 insisted : ' i have asthma , so of course i cough a lot '
both men , who work as doctors , have vehemently denied the claims
