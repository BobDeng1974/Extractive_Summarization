@entity1 's position as @entity3 boss remains tenuous after admitting he wants to better himself , days after an approach from @entity5			1
@entity1 saw his side knocked out of the @entity7 to @entity8 last night thanks to @entity10 's early header , and if it was to be his last match in charge at the @entity14 , the goal marked a disappointing end to a four - and - a - half year project			1
@entity5 's approach was rejected , but @entity1 admitted he is frustrated not to be in the @entity18 after @entity3 came so close in the play - offs			2
@entity10 heads @entity8 into an early lead the @entity8 striker runs off to celebrate with his team - mates @entity3 : @entity23 6 ; @entity24 5 ( @entity25 12 , 6 ) , @entity26 5 , @entity27 5 , @entity28 6 ; @entity29 7 ( @entity30 62 ) , @entity31 5 , @entity32 6 , @entity33 6 ; @entity34 6 ( @entity35 68 ) , @entity36 6 subs not used : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 booked : @entity31 , @entity26 @entity8 : @entity42 6 ; @entity43 6 , @entity44 7 , @entity45 7 , @entity46 6 ; @entity47 8 ( @entity48 67 ) , @entity49 7 , @entity50 6 ; @entity51 7 , @entity10 7 ( @entity52 77 ) , @entity53 7 subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 goals : @entity10 ( 2 ) booked : @entity53 , @entity51 attendance : 3,223 man of the match : @entity47 ( @entity8 ) he said : ' everybody wants to better themselves , when you 've been in @entity67 a few years and came so close in may to getting ourselves in the @entity18 , it 's frustrating			1
' it 's a big club , and it will be a big job for somebody			0
' i love this football club			0
i 've had four - and - a - half years , 230 odd games			0
' @entity1 's comments after @entity3 's win at @entity77 on saturday - that he felt ' proud ' to be linked with the @entity5 job - were sure to unsettle			1
@entity8 duly took advantage on the pitch			0
they were given joy down the left twice in the opening two minutes , and scored at the second attempt			0
@entity10 's hold up play allowed @entity53 free , and his perfect cross was headed past @entity23 by the man who started the move			2
chances were sparse , but @entity28 hit the post for @entity3 with a deflected effort , before @entity49 pulled his effort just wide at the other end			0
as @entity8 embark on another cup run , @entity3 are still looking for their first home win of the season			2
@entity1 's future is uncertain , but @entity3 owner @entity99 's programme notes were telling , revealing he had been asked by a lawyer to allow @entity1 to transfer to @entity5 , a request he rejected			1
few would begrudge @entity1 a move up a division when his job seemed at risk a fortnight ago due to a slow start to the @entity67 campaign			0
managers @entity1 and @entity109 give their instructions from the touchline @entity112 ( left ) and @entity49 do battle in the midfield @entity8 's @entity49 takes at shot at @entity3 's goal			1

*nightmare* start for @entity3 as @entity10 heads only goal after two minutes
@entity8 hold on to *qualify* for round four
*speculation* over @entity3 manager @entity1 's future with @entity5 keen to appoint him as new manager
