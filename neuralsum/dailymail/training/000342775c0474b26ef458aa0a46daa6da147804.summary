by @entity0 the @entity1 has begun using a facial - recognition surveillance system that will store millions of mug shots - and could even use driving licence pictures			1
fbi director @entity5 told lawmakers ' we ’re piloting the use of mug shots , along with our fingerprint database , to see if we can find bad guys by matching pictures with mug shots			2
earlier this year the @entity14 revealed the system is capable of processing 55,000 faces a day - and that it will have 52 million faces by 2015			1
the database , shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal , state and local law enforcement agencies across the @entity21 , already has 7 - 8 million individuals loaded			1
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) system builds on the @entity1 ’s legacy fingerprint database , which already contains well over 100 million individual records , and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data , including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data			1
@entity23 combines all these forms of data in each individual ’s file , linking them to personal and biographic data like name , home address , id number , immigration status , age , race , etc. this immense database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal , state and local law enforcement agencies across the @entity21			1
however , @entity5 admitted he was not sure where the pictures were coming from , amid claims driving license pictures as well as police mug shots would be used			0
' i do n’t think so			0
the @entity56 , as i understand it , is about mug shots , ' @entity5 said , according to @entity58			0
' i think there is some circumstances in which when states send us records , they ’ll send us pictures of people who are getting special driving licenses to transport children or explosive materials or something — but as i understand it , those are not part of the searchable @entity23 database			2
' the database , shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal , state and local law enforcement agencies across the @entity21 , already has 7 - 8 million individuals			1
earlier this year the @entity14 , under the @entity77 , obtained records from the bureau showing as many as 52 million images by next year , and that it will include pictures of innocent people			1
in response to a question from rep. @entity85 ( @entity86 ) , the director said he was n't sure of the accuracy of the @entity14 's claims			0
' i saw some of the same media , and that 's what led me to ask my folks : so what ’s the deal with this ? ' @entity5 said			0
' and the explanation to me was the pilot is mug shots			0
' because those are repeatable , we can count on the quality of them			0
' and they ’re tied to criminal conduct , clearly			0
and so there was not a plan and there is not at present where we are going to add other non-mug shot photos			0
but again , if i ’ve got that wrong i 'll fix it with you			0
' the @entity1 is piloting the program with a company called @entity115			0
@entity85 said @entity115 has also produced a @entity117 facial recognition database holding some 244 million images			1
' will your @entity23 system be capable of importing the @entity117 records or searching the @entity117 records ? ' she asked - to which @entity5 said he was unsure			1
currently , if you apply for any type of job that requires fingerprinting or a background check , your prints are sent to and stored by the @entity1 in its civil print database			2
however , the @entity1 has never before collected a photograph along with those prints - but this is changing with @entity23			2
now an employer could require you to provide a ' mug shot ' photo along with your fingerprints			0
if that ’s the case , then the @entity1 will store both your face print and your fingerprints along with your biographic data			0
' the records we received show that the face recognition component of @entity23 may include as many as 52 million face images by 2015 , ' the @entity14 's @entity140 said			1
the latest documents also reveal that non-criminal photos will be included			2
' one of our biggest concerns about @entity23 has been the fact that it will include non-criminal as well as criminal face images , ' the @entity14 said			1
' we now know that @entity1 projects that by 2015 , the database will include 4.3 million images taken for non-criminal purposes			1
the @entity14 received the records in response to a @entity77 lawsuit for information on @entity23 ( @entity23 )			0
the system builds on the @entity1 ’s legacy fingerprint database , which already contains well over 100 million individual records , and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data , including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data			1
@entity23 combines all these forms of data in each individual ’s file , linking them to personal and biographic data like name , home address , id number , immigration status , age , race , etc. the database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal , state and local law enforcement agencies across the @entity21			1
the system builds on the @entity1 ¿ s legacy fingerprint database , which already contains well over 100 million individual records , and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data , including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data			1
by 2012 , @entity23 already contained 13.6 million images representing between 7 and 8 million individuals , and by the middle of 2013 , the size of the database increased to 16 million images			1
the new records reveal that the database will be capable of processing 55,000 direct photo enrollments daily and of conducting tens of thousands of searches every day			1
the new system also link criminal and non-criminal fingerprint databases			2
every record — whether criminal or non — will have a “ @entity208 ” ( @entity208 ) , and every search will be run against all records in the database			0
' this means that even if you have never been arrested for a crime , if your employer requires you to submit a photo as part of your background check , your face image could be searched — and you could be implicated as a criminal suspect — just by virtue of having that image in the non-criminal file , sayd the @entity14 the states taking part in the project it says the new system raises major privacy concerns			2
' @entity23 will allow law enforcement at all levels to search non-criminal and criminal face records at the same time			0
' this means you could become a suspect in a criminal case merely because you applied for a job that required you to submit a photo with your background check			0
' second , the @entity1 and @entity239 have thus far failed to enact meaningful restrictions on what types of data can be submitted to the system , who can access the data , and how the data can be used			0
' this is not how our system of justice was designed and should not be a system that @entity21 tacitly consent to move towards			2

*campaigners* say database poses ' real *threats* to privacy ' for @entity21
system is capable of processing 55,000 faces a day
7 - 8 million people have already been *uploaded*
