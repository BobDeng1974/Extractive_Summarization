the eight admitted today that when the 50kg instrument plunged down through the 600 - year - old church tower it ' scared the living daylights out of them '			1
one parishioner tripped and fell in the rush to leave @entity16 & @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , but luckily nobody was seriously injured because the bell got stuck 30ft above their heads			1
it tolls for thee : the huge bell which crashed through the ceiling of a church in @entity18 , @entity19 , after a group of bellringers aged up to 90 gave it a hefty tug			1
another of the bells is said to be ' hanging by a thread ' saved from the bell : @entity36 and his fellow bellringers @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , who were forced to flee when a 50kg instrument crashed down during practice it has caused so much structural damage that the church has now been sealed off and emergency works started in case the five other bells also fall down			1
veteran bellringer @entity39 , 79 , who first started there as a 14 year - old , said : ' the bell came adrift and jammed between two beams which is incredibly lucky really			1
terrifying : the distance fallen by the 50kg bell through the church tower as bellringers fled below ' no one is allowed back in there at the moment because it is so dangerous			1
i believe the hundredweight bell is just hanging on by a thread			0
' the drama happened on november 5 after one of the group noticed the tenor bell was proving difficult to ring during their regular tuesday practice session			0
they gave a hefty tug on their rope - and the main axis spindle of the bells broke and sent one plunging down the church tower			1
the bell smashed into the timber beams in the clock chamber floor and scattered timberwork and debris			2
emergency engineers were called in and they immediately closed the church , which remains shut			0
the engineers have temporarily secured the remaining five bells to stop them from falling and causing any further damage			0
@entity89 vicar @entity88 said : ' the bell which has fallen down is the fifth - if it had been the tenor bell there could have been very serious consequences			2
' it has caused significant damage but we hope that it can be swiftly repaired and we can hold services at the church again within the week			0
' the bell ringers are very shaken but thankfully managed to escape without serious injury , although one person suffered bruising as they fell down the stairs			0
' the bellringers are from the local @entity107 group who practice at the church between 7.30pm and 9pm every tuesday			2
they are led by the oldest bell ringer in the @entity112 and @entity113 , 90 - year - old @entity36 , who first began bell ringing as a 12 - year - old in 1933			1

@entity127 , from @entity128 , @entity19 , said : ' i have never heard of anything like this in my 42 years of ringing			2
' what happened in @entity18 was a freak and very rare accident and i 'd be surprised if i hear of another incident like this in my lifetime			2
' the @entity112 and @entity139 diocese is now carrying out an investigation			1

' the @entity151 at @entity18 is working with engineers to investigate what could have caused this to happen			2
