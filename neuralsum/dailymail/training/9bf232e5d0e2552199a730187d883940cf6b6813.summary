@entity10 , 37 , stunned the @entity12 court wednesday when she refused to answer several questions about the alleged incident that took place last fall while the woman was nine months pregnant with a baby from a sperm donor			1

the @entity3 - born @entity10 , who reportedly met the twice - divorced @entity4 a decade ago while working as an au pair , said in court that after enduring years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband , she has developed a habit for submissiveness , which could explain why she offered no resistance when mr @entity4 allegedly put a gun to her head september 5 , 2012			1
' mentally , physically , i was n't there , ' she said			0
' it 's a response system to fear and stress i learned very early , ' the @entity12 @entity49 reported			0
it was also her deep - seated submissiveness and fear of challenging authority that kept her from trying to escape or summon help , according to mrs @entity10			1
after initially refusing to answer questions about the 911 call , on thursday the woman finally offered an explanation , telling the court that she had stashed a prepaid phone under the mattress sometime before the september 2012 incident because her husband was known to take away her possessions			2
after allegedly spending two days chained to her bed and suffering abuse , @entity10 said she finally summoned the courage to retrieve the hidden phone because she feared her husband might kill her ‘ i decided i had to save my [ unborn ] daughter , ’ @entity10 testified			0

prompted by prosecutor @entity80 to explain how she managed to dial 911 , @entity10 haltingly said that she counted the keys on the phone , which had raised buttons rather than a flat screen			0
the woman then dropped the device and pushed the ' send ' button with her tongue , she recalled			0
prior to her testimony , @entity10 surprised those present in the @entity74 @entity73 by handing out copies of a letter she had written , in which she complained about being treated in an unfair manner by everyone involved in the case , even her own lawyer			2
later that day , @entity95 , @entity4 's attorney , got a chance to cross-examine mrs @entity10 , questioning her claim that her notoriously tight - fisted husband , who once berated her for spending $ 15 at a car wash , has agreed to a postnuptial contract , which called for the real estate mogul to pay @entity10 $ 2million in case of a divorce			1
@entity104 also cast doubt on mrs @entity10 ’s assertion that as part of the deal , her husband has agreed to pay all the expenses incurred by her sperm donor , a renowned @entity112 ballroom dancer			1
details of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during 74 - year - old @entity4 's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force			1

she took the stand wednesday at @entity130 to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold @entity10 over for trial			0

during her wednesday testimony , @entity10 stunned the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended			0
the @entity156 reported that when the 37 - year - old said , ' i refuse to answer that ' , in response to one of the questions , the judge 's eyes widened			0
claims of innocence : the real estate magnate vehemently denies the abuse charges , contending that he 's the victim of a scam she then abruptly left the courtroom , leading the judge to suggest that @entity10 might be ' disturbed ' and ' paranoid			1
' the @entity3 native has claimed in a 43 - page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband			2
the divorce papers state that @entity4 wielded his considerable power against her like ' a weapon of mass destruction ' and claim she lived in virtual isolation ' as a slave ' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse			0
she said he made her drink out of a dog 's water bowl and dunked her head in the toilet after she vomited from morning sickness			0
there have already been doubts raised about her account of what happened on the night of september 4 after gynecological reports that arguably show @entity10 did not sustain the degree of sexual abuse she claims and questions were raised as to how she was able to call 911 while her hands were cuffed behind her back			2
@entity4 is the brother and business partner of billionaire @entity202 , one of the richest people in the @entity204			0
