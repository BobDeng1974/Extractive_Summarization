a mother has told of her ten - year - old daughter ’s devastation that her school was branded ‘ intolerant ’ after she gave the wrong answer when asked ‘ what is a lesbian ’			1
@entity7 came home crying after @entity10 inspectors interrogated her about homosexuality during a visit to @entity13			1
the free school , in @entity15 , has now been put in special measures after an official report found that discrimination ‘ persisted ’ at the school because of ‘ homophobic language ’			2
@entity7 , 10 , came home in tears after being questioned by @entity10 inspectors			1
her mother @entity23 said the questioning was ' completely inappropriate ' parents say inspectors ‘ aggressively ’ questioned just a few young children about lesbian relationships to form the basis of their judgement			1
they deny their children are intolerant and are compiling a petition against @entity10 ’s decision , which has the potential to close down the well - performing faith school			1
@entity7 ’s mother @entity23 , 46 , said : ‘ the questioning was completely inappropriate			1
they asked her what lesbians were , and whether she felt trapped in someone else ’s body			1
‘ she said she did n’t want to talk about it , because she was embarrassed			2
she did n’t know why they were asking and she was n’t prepared for it			2
‘ she ’s been crying a lot over it			2
she thinks the bad @entity10 report is her fault			2
‘ the silly thing is , @entity7 knows about same sex relationships because one of our best family friends is gay			1
‘ there ’s no way she ’s homophobic – she just did n’t realise they would be asking that kind of thing			2
they put her on the spot			2
’ after speaking to @entity7 and several other students , the inspectors rated the school ‘ inadequate ’ on pupil safety			1
open : @entity66 , which teaches pupils aged four to 18 , has a @entity69 ethos but no faith - based selection criteria , resulting in an intake that includes pupils from various religions they wrote : ‘ use of derogatory language relating to race or sexual orientation persists because the curriculum does not teach pupils about equality , diversity and the need to be tolerant and respectful towards those who are different to themselves			0
‘ @entity90 ’ response to inspectors ’ questions showed immaturity and a lack of awareness in discussing these matters			1
’ but mrs @entity7 , a pathology registrar who lives in @entity15 , said this verdict was ‘ grossly unfair ’ and did not reflect the ethos of the school			1
she added : ‘ we do n’t think it ’s fair to be asking children these questions			2
‘ they ’re highly personal and they ’re also irrelevant			0
@entity10 should be assessing the school on the quality of the education			0
this is beyond its remit			0
’ the schoolgirl said she felt to blame for the school 's branding as ' intolerant ' @entity7 , who dreams of becoming a dentist , moved to the school three years ago from a local state school , where she was being bullied			1
her mother says she has flourished at the school and gone from being a mediocre pupil to being one of the best in her year			0
her younger siblings , @entity120 , 10 , @entity121 , 7 , and @entity122 , 5 , have also thrived – with @entity121 now three years ahead of his peer group in reading			0
mrs @entity7 , who is a @entity126 - born @entity125 , and her husband @entity124 , 42 , a nurse , said their children were upset by @entity10 ’s findings			1
she added : ‘ it ’s true that it ’s a @entity69 school , but the ethos is not discriminatory			0
my children know all about other faiths			0
‘ a lot of the other schools around here are dire , but this school is truly wonderful			0
it would be devastating if it closed down			0
’ @entity13 was placed in special measures earlier this week after officials identified serious weaknesses in teaching and behaviour from their visit in november			1
principal @entity145 strongly disputed the negative findings and said he will challenge the hostile inspection			0
he said : ‘ we have happy , high achieving pupils , and we are oversubscribed - we always have a lot more applications than we have places			0
‘ yet @entity10 ’s approach to us was negative at every stage , as if the data collected had to fit a predetermined outcome			0
’ a @entity158 spokesperson said of @entity66 : ‘ this school has been troubled for some time and @entity10 have been monitoring it carefully			0
this report shows that problems persist and there are continued concerns about leadership , the quality of learning and safeguarding			0

@entity7 came home crying over @entity172 inspectors ' questions
the schoolgirl had been asked if she felt trapped in her own body
after becoming embarrassed she is said to have given ' wrong answer '
she feels to blame for @entity13 's branding as ' intolerant '
