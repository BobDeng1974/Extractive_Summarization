@entity0 may have snubbed @entity2 ’s offer of a handshake before the final whistle sounded on @entity7 ’s shock @entity5 win over @entity8 , but the 47 - year - old will gladly borrow some of @entity2 ’s tricks as he tries to guide the @entity12 club to @entity13 again			1
@entity0 faces @entity14 – where he spent 11 years as a player – at @entity16 on saturday knowing that another upset would see @entity7 return to the national stadium in the semi-finals of the @entity5 for the first time in more than a century			1
remarkably , he has already taken @entity7 there twice in the @entity24 final and @entity26 final in 2013			1
@entity7 boss @entity27 ( centre left ) rebuffed @entity2 's ( right ) handshake during their @entity5 tie @entity0 did not want to be distracted by @entity2 ’s premature offer of congratulations when @entity7 came from behind to record a stunning 4 - 2 win at @entity34 in january , before going on to take another @entity36 scalp in @entity37 in the fifth round			1
but the @entity7 manager can not help but admire the @entity8 manager ’s win - at - all - costs mentality compared with some managers ( look away @entity43 ) who are obsessed with imposing their ‘ philosophy ’ on a club			1
‘ i like the fact that he will do whatever it takes to win , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we are in an era of managers who sometimes their own philosophy gets in the way of what ’s the most important thing to win each individual game			2
@entity0 believes the big teams in the @entity36 are jealous of @entity7 @entity8 were beaten 4 - 2 by @entity12 outfit @entity7 during the fourth round back in january ‘ @entity2 sets up his team to win			1
the @entity24 final ( against @entity63 ) was a good example of that			2
‘ for me , that ’s what management is about			2
not just saying “ we ’ve got good players , go and play ”			2
it ’s about what tweaks and adaptations are we going to make today to give us the best chance of winning ? that ’s why i like looking at what @entity2 does because he has great skill at that			1
’ it ’s one reason why @entity0 is happy to let talk of the poor playing surface at @entity16 carry on ahead of @entity14 ’s visit			1
he believes that it got into the heads of @entity37 ’s players in the last round and contributed to @entity7 ’s 2 - 0 win			1
‘ i think more was made of the pitch for the @entity37 game , ’ he added			2
‘ by the time their lads came to the game it was probably a bigger thing than it actually it was			2
we ’d had a dry week and it was n’t too bad			0
‘ if you look around , a lot of pitches are not in a great state at the moment and we ’ve got some good technical players			0
‘ we ’ve found that rather than saying “ @entity107 , i just need big strong physical players on the pitch ” , you need technical players that can handle the bad pitch and we ’ve tried to get our best technical team out there			0
’ @entity110 , pictured after scoring against @entity8 , faces a late fitness test on a knee injury @entity2 is n’t the only @entity36 boss that @entity0 admires			1
the ambitious @entity7 boss has also modelled his managerial style on sir @entity117 and was able to study @entity119 ’s situation while scouting for @entity120 in 2011 following his departure from @entity122			1
‘ obviously i ’m ambitious like every player in the squad and every member of staff , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you ’ve got to want to be right at the top of your game , and i ’m no different			0
‘ there are many managers i look at			0
the @entity120 experience was great for me because i ’d just left @entity122 and they gave me the opportunity to work within their scouting network			0
‘ the longer that went on , the more senior @entity36 targets they sent me to watch			0
it ’s a great insight into how a club like @entity120 have to operate because obviously they ca n’t compete with @entity138 and @entity8 so they had to look at the level underneath or the players that were n’t obvious to everybody else			0
‘ i really enjoyed that and learned a lot from it			0
i got offered a couple of jobs within that period but i wanted to see that short - term through with the @entity120 experience			0
‘ in terms of managers , sir @entity117 is an obvious one			0
his leadership qualities but also the way he evolved as a manager			0
‘ myself and ( assistant ) @entity155 , the rest of the staff , try to have a modern approach with the way we do everything but with an old school mentality of discipline , honesty and commitment			0
we expect those old school demands from the players			0
‘ with sir @entity117 and @entity169 , you look at the discipline and the way the players drove on to the end in every game , and the pride they had in wearing the shirt , but also how he evolved all the time in progressing the club			0
i think he ’s a great one to look at			0
’ so having won the playoff final with @entity7 in 2013 just three months after losing the @entity24 final 5 - 0 to @entity178 , what are @entity0 ’s priorities this time around as he tries to take the @entity182 club to the semi-finals of the @entity5 for the first time since 2011 ? he said : ‘ it ’s difficult because when we had the @entity24 final , all the way i was saying “ the league is more important ”			1
but when we got to the semi-final we were on the point of making history			2
‘ i want to do both but at this stage , when you ’re so close to being in an @entity5 semi-final at @entity13 , this has got to take priority at the moment			1

@entity0 snubbed @entity2 's offer of a handshake before final whistle
@entity7 take on @entity14 in @entity5 for a semi-final place at @entity13
@entity0 has already guided @entity7 twice to the national stadium
