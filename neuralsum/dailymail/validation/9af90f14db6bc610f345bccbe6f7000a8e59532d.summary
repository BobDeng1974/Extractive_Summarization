@entity0 and its neighboring @entity2 countries are notorious for censoring ' sexual ' album covers by female artists in order to make the artwork more appropriate for a conservative audience			1
record companies hoping to sell their artists 's albums are ever - more sensitive to the beliefs and cultural traditions of each market they 're selling to , and will often tailor album covers in order to avoid offence			1
in some extreme cases there have been reports of the @entity0 government paying religious police members of the @entity23 for the @entity24 and the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) to manually alter from covers			2
they ’ve also colored her legs black in order to give the impression that she ’s covered up going ga - ga : @entity51 's behind was fully clothed when the album was released in the @entity2 the altered covers are found on music download sites such as @entity55 as well as in regular stores			1
it has been reported in the past that police officers have unwrapped cd cases , removed the front and back inserts and carefully and painstakingly colored in with marker pen any photos baring exposed female flesh that is deemed objectionable			0
some @entity67 scholars specify which areas of the body must be covered ; while others require all but the eyes to be covered , using garments			1
most mainstream scholars say that men , in contrast , should only cover themselves from the navel to the knees the @entity80 is a government agency that employs religious police , called @entity82 , to make sure that citizens adhere strictly to the teachings of @entity67 , especially those pertaining to dress , socialization , morality and prayer			2
the commission comprises approximately 10,000 @entity82 and has nearly 500 centers within the country			0
however , while police officers operating within the @entity2 are willing to go to extreme lengths in order to make sure any album artwork is appropriate , it is actually far easier for record companies to simply produce separate versions of well - known covers			1
on cloud nine : @entity101 is seen floating on a cloud on her main album cover , but is completely swaddled in the picture for her @entity106 front cover ( right ) dreamy : looking lush on a sunbed , this is the original @entity101 album cover nightmare ! @entity101 's album @entity112 was heavily doctored by @entity0 censors many labels now offer two cover options , particularly for their most popular performers , ensuring that the artwork will require no further doctoring and can be sold without causing offence			2
there have been some memorable redesigns in recent years with @entity122 wearing a wrap to cover up her white swimsuit , on the cover of her 2001 record fever , @entity32 swapping her revealing dominatrix outfit in favor of a one - piece leather body suit for her 2008 album @entity132 , and @entity101 being consumed by clouds on 2010 hit @entity106 , all in the name of @entity2 decency			1
almost all of @entity138 's albums have been adjusted for audiences in @entity140 while @entity141 has also been targeted by the censors			0
in @entity51 's 2013 album , the cover was also altered for its @entity2 release			1
the blue orb she holds in front of her was enlarged to cover what was visible of her breasts			0
it 's a wrap ! in pictures for the @entity155 album , @entity138 is shown wearing tops that cover virtually all exposed flesh spot the difference : @entity138 has been censored on a number of occasions , with many of her album shots proving too raunchy for @entity2 audiences cover girl : butterfly by @entity138 showed the singer wearing a top covering her shoulders and belly button her legs were also colored to make her appear clothed			1
of course , @entity171 has its own history of moral censorship of photos too			0
however censors in the @entity171 typically do n't try to re-clothe people who are deemed to be wearing too little			0
instead offending details such as belly buttons and exposed nipples are removed or blurred out			0
@entity180 is notorious for their ads of scantily clad ' amateur models ' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from ' real women ' around the globe			2
earlier this week the company made a rebranding change that saw the company choosing to airbrush out some of the models ' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins			0
@entity195 : @entity122 's fever album was redesigned to prevent anyone getting hot under the collar stripped : @entity141 's attempt to be sexy was kept under wraps in @entity0			0

religious beliefs in a number of @entity2 countries require women to be covered
designers 're - *imagine* ' a lot of album art to respect local culture and traditions
