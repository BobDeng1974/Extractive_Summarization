by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 16 may 2013 a model railway fan has been ordered to dismantle his £ 10,000 train set in his loft by his housing association on health and safety grounds			1
father - of - three @entity8 , 61 , has 63 locomotives which whizz along 70ft of track around the perimeter of his attic			1
his train set includes hand - crafted stations , depots , streets and tiny figures - which are all enjoyed by his grandchildren and great - grandchildren			1
train enthusiast : @entity8 , 61 , with his model train set in his attic in @entity22 , @entity23 models : the track which runs round the perimeter of @entity8 's attic is 70feet long			1
he had been ordered to take it down by his housing association but a social housing firm now says @entity8 has made ' alterations ' to the two - bed 1950s property in @entity22 , @entity23 , without permission - breaching strict planning regulations			2
@entity8 , who has lived in the home for fourteen years , says a housing official arrived to inspect a leaky chimney and told him the train set had to go			1
they want the set removed while they carry out a safety assessment - but @entity8 would rather be evicted than tear up his treasured track			1
retired builder @entity8 said : ' i 've been building train sets since i was 11			1
it 's been a lifelong passion of mine and i take a real pride in creating things			0
' when i moved into this house i decided i needed a project to keep me going as a hobby and i decided to build a railway in the loft			0
' some people like to spend their money down the pub or play a few games of snooker , but for me i build railways			0
' i 've made much of the scenery myself and spent anything from £ 8,000 to 10,000 on it			0
miniature station : the stations and depots are all hand - crafted and there are even model people steaming : the train set , which includes 63 locomotives , must be taken apart , @entity8 has been told intricate : @entity8 has been building model train sets for the last 40 years and started building his current set in his loft 14 years ago ' there 's absolutely no way i 'm taking it down now - if they want to evict someone over a train set that 's up to them			1
' @entity8 's woes began when he rang @entity84 to report a leaking chimney at the £ 140,000 ex-council property where he lives with his disabled wife @entity87 , 64			2
he says the only work he 's ever done to make room for the train set was to put down flooring and replace a single , faulty electrical socket			2
@entity8 , who retired due to ill health , said : ' they have said that unless i dismantle the railway , they will send in their workman to pull it apart so they can put right the changes i 've made			2
' all i 've done is put down flooring that meets all the required regulations and i 've even coated the little buildings i make in fire - retardant			0
control panel : @entity8 has been ordered to take the set apart - but has challenged his housing association to try and evict him rather than take the set apart eviction ? @entity8 , who lives in this housing association property in @entity22 , @entity23 , has vowed to keep his model train set together - even if he faces being thrown out of his property ' everything is based on trestle tables			1
i 've not damaged a thing			0
this house was a tip when i moved in			0
i 've spent thousands down the years doing it up			0
' i even fitted my own central heating - you wo n't hear them complaining about that			0
' people might think model railways are childish - but i do n't think i 'm being the childish one here			0
' @entity84 insists @entity8 's track has to go so inspectors can make sure the loft area is safe			1
the firm manages over 3,600 homes across south @entity23			0
@entity132 , head of asset management , said : ' it is part of our tenancy agreement that tenants must seek permission to make any alterations to our properties so that we can make sure it is safe and meets the required building regulations			0
' we have written to mr @entity8 to explain that all items in the loft space must be removed so that we can gain access and reinstate the timber members to ensure the property is safe			2
' once this work has been done , we will look at ways for mr @entity8 's train set to be accommodated safely			1
