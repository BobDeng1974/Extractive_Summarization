by @entity1 reporter published : 01:03 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 04:06 est , 7 august 2012 looking back at the days leading up to the fatal july 20 movie theater shooting in @entity3 , @entity4 , it appears now that there were ignored warning signs that could have saved many lives			1
psychiatrist dr @entity9 who counseled shooter @entity10 reportedly tried to discuss her worries about his mental condition with @entity15 staff and at least one campus police officer in early june			1
on june 10 , the once - promising graduate student dropped out of the school , and the university officials who were aware of dr. @entity21 's concerns apparently felt they could no longer do anything to follow the issue as he was no longer under their jurisdiction			1
little did they know that @entity10 bought his first assault weapon just three days before leaving the school			1
concerns : dr @entity9 ( left ) called @entity15 security staff about student @entity10 nightline reports that while dr. @entity21 - who is a member of the campus behavior evaluation and threat assessment team herself - notified an unspecified number of other members , the entire group never convened to discuss the threat posed by @entity10 because he had already left the university			1
said group was created to address behavioral problems as well as potential security issues involving students and was composed of faculty and staff , including campus police			2
@entity21 could not be immediately reached for comment			0
members of the university did not immediately return telephone messages seeking comment			0
the doctor has since been questioned by @entity4 police as a part of the investigation into the shooting which left 12 dead and 58 injured			1
a lawyer was present for the meeting			0
@entity10 ' attorneys filed a motion that revealed @entity10 was seeing the psychiatrist			2
the revelation raised questions about @entity10 ' year of study at the university 's medical campus and about possible motives behind the shooting			2
an online resum√© listed schizophrenia as one of dr @entity21 's research interests			0
who knew what : university of @entity4 police chief @entity74 answered questions at a news conference just days after the attack but the details of the chain of command have still been kept quiet threats : on the same day as the press conference , police were called to the school because a suspicious package was found on the campus the defense motion demanded that a package allegedly sent to dr @entity21 by @entity10 , and received at the university after the shooting , be kept sealed because of doctor - patient confidentiality			1
it also demanded information on who may have leaked information about its contents to some news media outlets that reported that @entity10 had written descriptions of an attack in a notebook			2
the spiral - bound pad , which sat unopened in the campus mail room , was filled with gun - wielding stick figures blowing away other stick figures , a law enforcement source said			0
' killer ' : @entity108 said he believes the caller was @entity10 , pictured in court , but can not prove it remembering the victims : he is suspected of shooting dead 12 cinema - goers and 58 more injured @entity115 district attorney @entity114 disputed reports that a notebook contained descriptions of an attack			1
district chief judge @entity120 has sealed all court orders , search warrants , affidavits and the case file			0
@entity10 has been charged with 24 counts of first - degree murder , 116 counts of criminal intent to commit murder and one count of illegal possession of an explosive device			0
a hearing on the defense motion is set for august 16			0
