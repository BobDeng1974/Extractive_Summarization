by @entity0 published : 14:20 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 06:04 est , 9 october 2013 a man who has suffered tens of thousands of silent crying seizures since he was a baby has been cured by pioneering surgery			1
@entity4 , 29 , endured years of pain and medications due to a rare benign tumor before the procedure at @entity9 at @entity10 in @entity11			1
but since undergoing surgery , which involved a laser killing the tumor and required just one stitch afterwards , he has miraculously not suffered a single seizure			1
' this surgery has changed my life , ' @entity4 told @entity20			2
' it 's amazing to have instantly gone from having 250 seizures a month to not having one			1
i 'm finally able to live an independent life			0
before the operation , he was having thousands a year long suffering : @entity4 , pictured as a boy , suffered a drop in his @entity37 thanks to medications and the seizures			1
by the time he was 13 , he was having 350 seizures a day and taking 25 pills the seizures started when he was a baby and appeared to be night terrors - jolting him awake and causing him to cry			1
when he was five , his mother noticed him grimace before a tear rolled down his cheek , and took him to the doctors where he was diagnosed him with a hypothalamic hamartoma , an abnormal collection of cells near his hypothalamus , which is located at the base of the brain			1
' the cells are like a little pacemaker that fires abnormal signals ' his neurosurgeon , dr @entity57 , explained			0
' they are basically like a computer that keeps resetting			0
you can imagine how disruptive that is and what their life is like			0
' as well as causing discomfort and sparking children to laugh or cry against their wills , the seizures can also damage the brain			2
doctors could do nothing but tell @entity4 to change his diet and give him medications - but drugs drastically affected his cognitive abilities , causing his iq to plummet from 120 to 79 , he told @entity80			2
pioneering : his neurosurgeon , dr @entity57 , used a laser to burn and kill a tumor at the base of his brain life changer : dr @entity57 ( with @entity4 ) said the abnormal cells caused the brain to reset every few minutes by the time he was 13 , he was having as many as 250 seizures a month and taking 25 pills a day			1
each seizure lasted around 20 seconds			0
' he had tremors in his hand , his eyes rolled up in his head so you could see the whites , he slept a lot and his drool was out of control , ' his mother @entity29 told @entity20			0
' he was losing ground mentally and physically			0
' @entity4 added : ' it 's impossible to explain the amount of pain i was experiencing			2
' he said that the seizures left him feeling displaced and with a pulsing in his ears			0
at one point when he was 13 , he asked his mother : ' why wo n't @entity113 just let me die ? ' but in august , dr. @entity57 was finally able to help and treated @entity4 with a new kind of surgery that uses @entity119 technology to find and destroy the tumor			1
charting his progress : a chart shows that he had five seizures the morning before surgery - but none since relief : his mother @entity29 said she was ' oh so happy ' that her son had not suffered a single seizure since dr @entity57 cut a two - millimeter incision in @entity4 's skull and inserted the laser catheter and lined it up perfectly - careful not to affect any surrounding brain matter			1
the laser heated up the tumor and killed it , and the cells were then absorbed into the body			2
afterwards , @entity4 needed just one stitch and stayed in hospital for a night			1
two months on , and @entity4 has not had a single seizure and can now finally focus on a future			1
' it was amazing , ' his mother told @entity142			0
' it went as text book perfect as it could			0
he had five seizures before the surgery that morning			0
has had none since so i was just oh so happy			0
' @entity4 said he now wants to find a job programming computer games			2

by the age of 13 , @entity4 was suffering up to 250 seizures a months and was taking 25 pills , with little *effect*
he was diagnosed with a benign tumor on the base of his brain
in august , doctors in @entity11 used a laser to burn and kill the tumor
he needed just one stitch and has not suffered a single seizure since
