the shape , evolution and lifespan of comet @entity4 / @entity3 have been revealed in a series of groundbreaking papers			1
using data from the @entity10 spacecraft , which is in orbit around the comet , scientists have revealed that the comet ’s interior is ‘ fluffy ’			1
among the other discoveries they found that the comet 's neck may have been ' eaten away ' over time , rather than being the result of two smaller bodies merging together			1
papers on @entity10 's comet ( pictured ) are to be published in the journal science tomorrow			1
they were co-authored by scientists from the @entity26 , @entity27			1
a new theory suggests its ' neck ' may have been eaten away like the core of an apple ( outgassing shown here ) to give it its odd shape several papers detailing the latest findings , and co-authored by @entity26 scientists , will appear in a special issue of the journal @entity40 tomorrow			1
@entity41 ( @entity42 ) is showing signs of waking up early as it streaks towards the @entity45 at almost 47,800 mph ( 76,900 km / h )			0
as it approaches the sun , the rubber duck - shaped lump of ice , dust and rock is expected to heat up and release more gas and water vapour from its interior			2
comets are most active when they reach perihelion , the point in their orbit when they are closest to the @entity45 but even at a distance of more than 200 million miles ( 320 million km ) , comet @entity42 is beginning to stir in dramatic fashion			0
dr @entity61 , from the @entity26 , @entity27 , who led one of several teams reporting latest findings from the @entity65 's @entity10 in the journal @entity40 , said : ' we are already seeing more activity			1
' @entity69 are sprouting up everywhere			0
we 've been surprised to see how active it is			0
it already has more jets than many other comets do at perihelion			0
' from the data , dr @entity75 from the @entity76 told @entity78 that they now had a greater understanding of the comet 's interior			1
he said the interior is now thought to be analogous to ' ash , cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow			0
' one of the papers used images from @entity10 ’s @entity88 ( @entity88 ) camera to analyse the structure of the comet			1
they found that most of the ‘ outgassing ’ activity of the comet was occurring at the neck , which connects the two larger lobes and gives it its ‘ rubber duck ’ appearance			2
it raises questions as to whether the comet is a combination of two smaller bodies , or began as one larger one that shrank around the middle , like an apple beating eaten around its core			1
' with the different instruments on @entity10 we hope to find out how much ice the nucleus of @entity116 contains , how deep below the surface it is buried , and what the composition of this ice is , ' dr @entity61 from the @entity26 , who was involved in the research , told @entity78			1
' this then will help us understand the comet 's aging			2
' this ties directly into one of the main questions we 're looking at now : was the comet formed in this strange shape , or is erosion responsible for " eating away " the comet 's middle ? ' @entity10 ( illustratino shown ) entered orbit around the comet on 6 august 2014 and , in november , it released the @entity136 lander towards the comet to return data from the surface			1
@entity10 is continuing to follow the comet , with closest approach to the sun scheduled for 13 august this year a second paper has detailed the surface of the comet that is currently visible to @entity10 , raising textures and features on its surface			1
this could help the team work out how the shape of the comet has evolved over time , and where also the largest deposits of water and ice might reside			2
currently only one side of the comet is visible , the ' northern ' side , as the other is facing away from the sun and is thus shrouded in darkness			2
the makes up more than half the comet 's total surface and is divided into 19 distinct regions , all named after ancient @entity167 deities			2
a third paper combines data from @entity88 and another instrument , the @entity171 and @entity172 ( @entity173 )			0
this study looks at the comet 's coma - the thick cloud of dust and gas that envelops the nucleus			2
as the comet gets closer to the sun , the coma grows more massive as the nucleus heats up and loses more material			0
the comet has also been found to be darker than coal in images taken by @entity10 , making other objects like the moon and @entity190 ( shown in composite image ) considerably brighter by measuring the activity in the coma , including changes in the ratio of dust to gas , the team should be able to estimate how quickly the comet is outgassing and losing mass. in so doing , the team hopes to learn more about how comets evolve			1
‘ because comets have very little gravity , dust and gas flow freely into space , ’ said dr @entity61			0
‘ but we were surprised to find a cloud of particles orbiting the comet that are large and heavy enough to defy the sun 's radiation pressure			2
’ the team was able to make this discovery thanks to @entity88 ' very sensitive cameras			0
‘ each pixel is about 30 centimeters [ 11.2 inches ] , ’ he continued			0
‘ you could n't see a coffee cup , but you could see a large lunchbox			0
the resolution is about 10 times higher than @entity221			0
’ currently only one side of the comet is visible , the ' northern ' side , as the other is facing away from the sun and is thus shrouded in darkness			0
the makes up more than half the comet 's total surface and is divided into 19 distinct regions , all named after ancient @entity167 deities ( shown ) a fourth paper described evidence for carbon - based molecules on the comet ’s surface , gathered by @entity10 's @entity239 and @entity240 ( @entity238 ) instrument			1
based on past comet studies , the team expected to see signatures of slightly more complex molecules such as alcohols , carboxylic acids and nitrogen - containing amines			0
however , the evidence from @entity238 suggests that the comet 's surface is instead dominated by simpler hydrocarbons			2
the discovery could have implications for our understanding of how carbon - based molecules first developed and spread through our solar system			0
scientists will be increasingly excited later this year , when the comet reaches its closest point to the sun on 13 august			1
at this point it will be most active , with new features and increased outgassing expected to be visible .			0

papers on @entity10 's comet are to be published in the journal @entity40
they were co-authored by scientists from the @entity26 , @entity27
data reveals how the comet could have a ' fluffy ' interior
its activity is also increasing *ahead* of close approach to sun in august
and a new theory suggests its ' neck ' may have been eaten away like the core of an apple to give it its odd shape
