by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is well aware of the need to bring back the ' feel - good factor ' when @entity5 kick off a new era against @entity7			1
a new - look side led by a new captain , @entity9 , have been charged with getting the @entity5 back on track nine weeks on from bombing out of the @entity11 at the first hurdle			1
the disappointment of that failure in @entity15 will be underlined by the plethora of empty seats at @entity18 on wednesday , when the lowest attendance since the stadium opened in 2007 is expected for the friendly with @entity7			1
fresh start : @entity5 manager @entity2 knows he needs to get the public back on side after the @entity11 preparation : @entity26 ( second from left ) challenges @entity27 ( third from right ) for the ball all the talk of a new beginning has clearly not appeased fans and @entity2 knows it is now up to his players to prove it on the pitch			1
' we 've only been together since sunday evening , but we seem to have crammed an awful lot into that period of time with our meetings and with our training sessions , ' he said on the eve of the match			0
' i certainly get the feeling that the players ca n't wait , really , to kick off this new campaign and kick it off with an important and quite difficult game at @entity18			1
' i am confident that the players are really ready to go and of course now it 's all a question of when they cross the white line and the referee blows his whistle because all the talking in the world does n't help you			2
it is what you do the field that counts			0
' after a friendly against @entity7 - ranked 53rd in the world - comes the start of @entity5 's @entity64 qualifiers in @entity65			1
monday 's match in @entity67 may well prove their toughest of @entity70 , although back - to - back victories would certainly improve the national mood			0
in control : @entity27 ( right ) fends off @entity74 and @entity75 during training at @entity77 on the run : forward @entity75 ( centre ) bursts away from @entity9 ( left ) during training ' there are things you ca n't guarantee and wanting it does n't guarantee you are going to get it , ' @entity2 said			2
' of course , we would all very , very much like to get two good results now , starting with tomorrow night and get that feel - good factor			0
' we 're also still aware that the two - year journey is a longish one , one that you 'll see an awful lot of changes within the team and in terms of the way the team plays and plays together			0
' a lot of these players wo n't have played together particularly and a lot of them will be very , very new in their international careers			2
' as time goes on , those things will improve , of course , but i ca n't disagree that this will be a good time to get two good results , two good performances and to show everyone my faith in the team is justified			0
' @entity2 is planning to field a ' young team ' against @entity7 , although revealed none of the four uncapped players in the 22 - man squad will start			1
in discussion : @entity2 , pictured speaking to @entity117 ( left ) and @entity118 ( right ) , will not start any of his four uncapped players against @entity7 intense : defender @entity120 ( left ) and @entity121 ( right ) tussle for the ball on monday while @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 may get a chance off the bench , @entity124 will have to wait			1
the @entity131 midfielder will be available for the @entity65 match but a knock rules him out of the @entity18 encounter , where he could be joined on the sidelines by @entity75			2
having secured a Â£ 16million deadline - day move from @entity139 , the @entity137 new boy took a knock in training on the eve of the game to put his participation in doubt			0
' we are happy for @entity75 he felt the move might lead to more regular football and that will only be to our advantage and we think or hope he will be ready to start , ' @entity2 said			2
' but unfortunately in training today he did manage to receive a knock in the session , but i have been assured he is okay and that it will not rule him out , but obviously i suppose it could happen			0
' i would be very disappointed if he could not play tomorrow because of what happened with the last kick of the session			0
