by @entity1 reporter published : 02:23 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 09:50 est , 16 december 2012 there are certain unmitigated facts – that a gunman entered @entity5 on friday morning , and that as a direct consequence , 27 people in the small town of @entity8 , @entity9 are dead			1
but as the investigation into the shooting goes on , many aspects of it remain complex			1
perhaps the biggest question lingering on people ’s minds across the nation is why the shooting happened – something that may never be answered in a satisfactory manner			1
it was initially reported that she was a substitute kindergarten teacher there			2
‘ no one has heard of her , ’ former board member @entity40 told the @entity41			2
‘ teachers do n’t know her			2
’ however , the @entity45 is still reporting that mrs @entity46 was a substitute teacher			2
it is also unclear what , if any , ties @entity33 had with the elementary school chief medical examiner dr. h. @entity50 was asked if the victims – including 20 children - suffered			1
' if so , ' he said , ' not for very long			2
' the terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages — the youngest 6 and 7 , the oldest 56			1
they included @entity5 , a little girl who had just moved to @entity8 from @entity64 ; @entity65 , a 27 - year - old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils ; and principal @entity5 , who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him and paid with her life			1
the tragedy has plunged @entity8 into mourning and added the picturesque @entity77 community of handsome colonial homes , red - brick sidewalks and 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change			1
a @entity9 state police man fights back tears on saturday a handwritten sign reads ' pray for @entity8 ' following the mass shooting at @entity5 faced with the unimaginable , townspeople sadly took down some of their @entity94 decorations and struggled saturday with how to go on			1
signs around town read , ' hug a teacher today , ' '' please pray for @entity8 ' and ' @entity98 will get us through			0
' as the ‘ today ’ show notes , information remains confusing and at times , contradictory			0
it was first reported that the gunman was buzzed in by @entity105 , but authorities later said that he forced himself in			0
police shed no light on what triggered @entity33 , 20 , to carry out the second - deadliest school shooting in @entity112 history , though state police lt. @entity113 said investigators had found " very good evidence ... that our investigators will be able to use in painting the complete picture , the how and , more importantly , the why			1
" he would not elaborate			0
however , another law enforcement official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said investigators have found no note or manifesto from @entity46 of the sort they have come to expect after murderous rampages such as the @entity128 bloodbath in 2007 that left 33 people dead			0
amid the confusion and sorrow , stories of heroism emerged , including an account of @entity135 , 47 , and the school psychologist , @entity5 , 56 , rushing toward @entity46 in an attempt to stop him			1
there was also 27 - year - old teacher @entity65 , whose name has been invoked as a portrait of selflessness and humanity among unfathomable evil			0
mourners gather for a candlelight vigil outside the @entity8 in @entity8 investigators told relatives she was killed while shielding her first - graders from danger			0
she reportedly hid some students in a bathroom or closet , ensuring they were safe , a cousin , @entity151 , told @entity155			0
' she put those children first			0
that 's all she ever talked about , ' a friend , @entity157 , told @entity45			2
' she wanted to do her best for them , to teach them something new every day			0
' there was also 6 - year - old @entity5 , whose grieving father , @entity164 , talked to reporters not long after police released the names of the victims but expressed no animosity , offering sympathy for @entity46 's family			1
' i ca n't imagine how hard this experience must be for you , ' he said			0

details surrounding shooting remain complex , as question of @entity185 and @entity33 's connection to @entity5 remain murky
many trying to understand how such a tragedy could happen
