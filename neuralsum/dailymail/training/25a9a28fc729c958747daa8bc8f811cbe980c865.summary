when @entity1 held her newborn baby daughter , she assumed there had been a terrible mistake as while she was black , her child had white skin , blonde hair and blue eyes			1
ms @entity1 and her then husband @entity9 , are both @entity10 , but their first daughter suffered from the rare genetic condition , albinism			1
@entity15 , who is now 14 , was born without any skin pigment and looked considerably different to her parents			1
ms @entity1 said the difference between her family is so vast that she is often mistaken for the albino children 's nanny			1
the mother - of - six from @entity41 , @entity39 said : ' when i am with my children i get strange looks because we look so different			2
' once i was leaving a shopping centre with @entity15 and @entity49 and a security guard asked where their mother was			0
' it used to make me angry but i am learning people need educating about what albinism is			0
' however , ms de @entity1 's biggest worry is how albinism will affect kids @entity15 , 14 , @entity49 , 12 , and @entity57 , nine			1
the condition is characterised by the absence of pigment in the skin , hair and eyes - which leaves sufferers exposed to a range of afflictions			2
the youngsters are so sensitive to sunlight that they need factor 100 sun block every two hours - and not allowed to play outside in the middle of the day			0
ms de @entity1 's three albino children also have to wear special glasses while outside due to the sun she said she wanted to help people to understand about the incredibly rare condition ms @entity1 and her ex husband both carried the albino gene which was passed to three of their children ms @entity1 , who is also mother to @entity9 , 13 , @entity79 , five and @entity80 , two , who are black , said : ' having children with this condition poses so many difficulties			1
' i 'm terrified they will develop skin cancer because they have no natural protection from the sun. ' i need to monitor them constantly to make sure they are n't burning and worry about what damage has already been done			0
' ms @entity1 was shocked when she gave birth to first child , @entity15 , at age 18 , with ex-husband , @entity95 , 63			1
she said : ' i thought someone was playing a trick on me and had switched my baby with a white family 's			2
' and after returning to their village in a poor part of @entity41 , @entity39 , ms @entity1 struggled with the way friends and neighbors reacted to her baby			1
ms @entity1 said when her children were growing up some neighbours made comments about their skin she said she is particularly scared that they may develop skin cancer because of their lack of pigment ms @entity1 , who now lives with partner @entity117 , left , knows her children may also have albino children she said : ' the neighbours began making comments about @entity15 , asking if she was diseased			1
' they even suggested @entity9 was n't the father and i had been with someone else			0
' it was n't until ms de @entity1 gave birth to her second child with albinism , @entity130 , one year later that she could put her mind to rest			1
' the doctors explained that both @entity9 and i must carry a gene for albinism and so each time we had a child there was a one in four chance the child would have it , ' she said			2
by the time @entity15 has seven , ms de @entity1 began to notice how the condition was beginning to affect her children			1
she said : ' i started noticing how red @entity15 and @entity49 became after being outside			0
later they would cry because of the pain of being burnt			0
' i felt helpless because i did n't know what to do			0
' worryingly , ms de @entity1 recalls how on occasions the children 's skin would become so damaged by the sun it would bubble			1
ms @entity1 said it could only take a few minutes in the sun for her children 's skin to bubble dangerously she said she wants to educate her own children and the public about albinism she said : ' it can happen so quickly when the sun is fierce			1
now i know not to let them into the sun after 10am			0
' if they have to leave the house i make sure they wear long sleeves , hats and plenty of sunscreen			0
' @entity166 said : ' we are like prisoners , we have to stay inside all the time in the summer			0
we ca n't play games like the others			0
' ms @entity1 , who lives with partner @entity117 , 37 , who is father to @entity80 , knows there 's a chance any of her children could have albino babies of their own			1
but with the help of doctors she now knows how to manage the condition and will be able to educate her own children in how to care for theirs			2
she said : ' i would feel like a normal grandmother and accept my grandchildren as i accepted my children			2
' the doctor explained everything to me			0
' i will constantly apply sunscreen on their skin and i 'll also try to let them play mainly in the night			0
' the @entity1 family 's story appears in @entity192 tomorrow , thursday november 6 , 9pm on @entity193			2
