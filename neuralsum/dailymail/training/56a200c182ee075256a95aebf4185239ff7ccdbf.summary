by @entity0 making a cup of tea or potting a plant in the garden may sound like simple , day - to - day tasks			2
but until recently , corporal @entity6 could barely imagine being able to complete them with ease			1
now the soldier , who lost his right arm to a @entity12 rocket - propelled grenade , is able to live a normal life – after becoming @entity15 ’s first person to be fitted with a bionic limb controlled by the mind			1
the robotic prosthetic – described as ‘ the stuff of science fiction ’ – means the married serviceman can pull on his own socks , cook , drive and use bank cards			2
he said yesterday : ‘ the surgery has made a massive improvement to my life			2
i have become a lot more independent and all the normal things i was struggling with have become so much easier			2
‘ when i first got told about the operation i thought it was some sort of fairy tale			0
but here i am today with this arm that is fitted and works off my mind			1
’ the soldier , of @entity43 , @entity44 , took a direct hit from a rocket in the insurgent stronghold of @entity48 , @entity49 , in 2010			0

@entity52 said : ‘ i heard a bang and within a split - second i was on the floor and my arm was on fire			2
i stood up and thought , “ oh , @entity58 ” and my arm just fell off			2
’ he initially received a traditional prosthetic , which allowed him to perform a limited range of tasks			1
but in january last year , he was flown to the @entity64 in @entity65			0
there , doctors ‘ rewired ’ the severed nerve endings from his shoulder – which had controlled his hand – into his chest			0
electrodes were delicately attached to his chest and connected to a tiny computer fitted on the prosthetic limb			1
corporal @entity6 lost his arm while serving in @entity49 in 2010			1
he is pictured wearing muscle sensors before the robotic arm was fitted corporal @entity6 had to have seven hours of surgery to rewire his nervous system before the new arm could be fitted			1
graphic shows how the muscle sensors control the robotic arm corporal @entity6 was injured when a grenade exploded in @entity86 now when he imagines moving his missing arm , electronic brain pulses travel through the nerve endings and the electrodes , sending messages to the micro-computer			1
the soldier , who serves in the @entity94 , can now open and close his hand , extend his fingers and rotate his wrist			0
sensors in the prosthesis will soon let him feel different temperatures			0
in carefree moments , he can make his wrist spin 360 degrees			0
‘ that is my party trick , ’ he joked			0
the @entity106 is paying the £ 60,000 cost of his bionic arm and surgery			1
nerve endings from corporal @entity6 's shoulder , which would have run down to his hand , were instead rewired into his chest muscles for 18 months corporal @entity6 has had the sensation of a hand growing in his chest the soldier has had to learn how to control his hand with electrodes sending signals to his new arm so that he can control it with impulses from his brain @entity123 , a lead prosthetic technician at the @entity126 military recovery centre in @entity127 , said working with @entity52 had ‘ put a lump in my throat ’			1
defence minister @entity130 said : ‘ it ’s the stuff of almost science fiction coming to reality			0
’ @entity52 is being medically discharged from the @entity134			0
but after spending @entity135 with his wife and family , he plans to explore fresh career opportunities – bolstered by his bionic arm			1
he said : ‘ having lost a lot of friends through my @entity134 career in @entity143 and @entity49 , i know i ’m very lucky to be here			2
it makes you realise it could have been you			0
’ corporal @entity6 said : ' when i first got told about the operation i thought it was some sort of fairy tale , that someone was taking the mickey			1
but here i am today with this arm that is fitted and works off my mind			1
it 's unbelievable ' corporal @entity6 has demonstrated that he can carry out everyday tasks such as potting a plant and making a jam sandwich using his prosthetic arm he said : ' there is no point in looking back because you can never turn back time			1
i am still very lucky to be here			0
