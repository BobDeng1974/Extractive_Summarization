claims : @entity1 , who is serving a life sentence for terror charges , has said @entity4 financed the 9/11 attacks in an extraordinary letter from his prison cell the man who claims he was the 20th 9/11 hijacker has named two of the most senior members of the @entity4 royal family as being the ones who paid him to carry out the terrorist attack			1
@entity1 alleges that @entity15 and princess @entity16 gave him cash and ‘ channeled a large amount of money ’ to another of the hijackers			1
he also claims that @entity25 ‘ was assisting me in my @entity23 terrorist activities ... and was doing so knowingly for @entity24 ’			0
the extraordinary allegations are in a letter that @entity1 wrote to a federal judge in @entity29 and are likely to be seized on by 9/11 conspiracy theorists			1
the letter has been entered as a prisoner civil rights complaint and has been assigned to district judge @entity33			1
@entity1 ’s letter has already been reported but the names were not made public until @entity36 saw a copy of the full letter			1
@entity1 , 46 , is currently serving life in jail after admitting his role in the 9/11 attacks , which the @entity4 government has always denied involvement in			1
his credibility has also long been called into question as even @entity24 has denied he had anything to do with his terrorist plots			2
@entity1 wrote to the @entity49 in @entity29 because he was studying at a flight school in @entity51 , @entity29 , in 2001 when he supposedly received the money from the @entity4			1
he wanted to testify in open court about what he knows but last week a magistrate recommended that his request be denied as it is not related to any ongoing case			2
the people that @entity1 has named are among the most powerful in the @entity4 royal family			2
prince @entity15 , 67 , is a former @entity4 ambassador to the @entity60 and a former @entity4 intelligence chief			1
he ran its intelligence service for 24 years			1
he stepped down from the latter post on september 1st 2001 , 10 days before 9/11			0
he was ambassador to @entity65 in 2003 before the invasion of @entity67 and was ambassador to @entity69 from july 2005 until december 2006			1
prince @entity15 attended @entity71 , a boarding school near @entity73 , followed by @entity74 before rising up the ranks in the @entity4 royal family , where his brothers dominate the top posts in the @entity80 nation ’s government			2
last year he took the unusual step of criticizing the @entity60 government and said that @entity4 was sick of president @entity83 marking red lines then seeing them become ‘ pinkish as time grew ’			2
accused : prince @entity15 is named by @entity1 in a letter to a federal judge as a funder of the 9/11 terror attacks			1
the @entity4 government has always denied any involvement in the attacks or their funding response : the @entity4 government said it had nothing whatsoever to do with the september 11 attacks he said : ‘ when that kind of assurance comes from a leader of a country like the @entity60 , we expect him to stand by it			1
’ his sister @entity106 , 63 , is the wife of another former @entity4 ambassador to the @entity60 , @entity107 , with whom she has eight children			1
she has previously faced claims of involvement in 9/11 before and two of the hijackers , - @entity111 and @entity113 - supposedly received regular $ 3,500 a month payments from two friends who got it from an account in her name			0
the @entity4 government angrily denied the allegations at the time and said that princess @entity15 ‘ wants her name cleared ’			1
in the 2004 9/11 commission report said it had found no evidence of her having any involvement in the funding of the attacks			2
among @entity1 's other extraordinary claims in the letter was that he was involved in a plot to shoot down @entity132 with president @entity133 on board			2
he claims that @entity136 bomber @entity135 , who is in the same @entity137 as him , tried to persuade him to keep quiet under a @entity139 deal to spare @entity141 mastermind @entity140 from the death penalty after his military tribunal in @entity144 , where he is being held			0
he also talks about how he handed over details of a plot to assassinate president @entity133 and first lady @entity148 during a trip to @entity150 in @entity151 whilst he was in office			0
lawyers for the federal government have taken @entity1 seriously enough to interview him over the claims at the maximum security @entity158 prison where he is serving a life sentence without parole			2
they say he had ' relevant ' material to contribute but he is problematic as a witness			0
' even if he somehow got to the point where he could testify , there would be a credibility issue , ' said @entity166 , a professor at the @entity167			0
' would his testimony be valuable ? that 's doubtful			0
' another problem is that @entity1 has repeatedly changed his account of his involvement in the sept. 11 plot and has behaved erratically in court			2
close relationship : president @entity176 with prince @entity107 , the then @entity4 ambassador , in august 27 , at @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179			1
prince @entity107 was succeeded by prince @entity15 as ambassador ' nothing to do with me ' : a 2006 video message , above , purportedly from @entity24 , featured a voice saying @entity1 was nothing to do with 9/11 husband : prince @entity188 is the husband of princess @entity16			1
he was ambassador to the @entity60 from 1983 until 2005 , when his brother - in - law @entity15 succeeded him			1
he described @entity1 , who refers to himself in writing as ' @entity190 , ' was first arrested on immigration charges in august 2001 after employees of a @entity194 flight school became alarmed that he wanted to learn to fly a @entity197 747 - even though he had no pilot 's license			2
he was in custody on september 11 , 2001 , and pleaded guilty in april 2005 to conspiring with the hijackers to kill @entity60			0
during his three - year legal fight , @entity1 repeatedly insulted the judge and tried to fire his lawyers			0
at one point he was facing the death penalty , which jurors decided against			0
during the hearing he spontaneously declared that he had planned to pilot a plane into the @entity208 on september 11			0
a psychologist called by his lawyers testified that @entity1 had paranoid schizophrenia			0
@entity1 mocked the testimony , shouting as he left courtroom : ' crazy or not crazy ? that is the question			0
' in 2006 a recording emerged online of @entity24 distancing himself from @entity1			0
he said : ' he had no connection at all with september 11			0
i am the one in charge of the 19 brothers , and i never assigned brother @entity219 to be with them in that mission			0
' although the audio was seen as ruling him out of the 9/11 attacks , it did not make clear if he was an @entity141 operative			0
last month , lawyers in a federal lawsuit against @entity4 were permitted to interview @entity1 in prison			1
what was said ca n't be shared publicly until the @entity60 government finishes sifting through the transcript to ensure it contains no secret messages that could pose a threat to @entity60			0
verdict : the report of the commission into the attacks said it had found no evidence ' that the @entity4 government as an institution or senior @entity4 officials individually funded the organization ' @entity244 , a lawyer who interviewed him , said : ' i will say that we believe it was relevant and material to our case			1
' @entity1 also wrote to the clerk in federal court in @entity252 in september , saying he had seen a report on @entity254 about another suit accusing the @entity257 - based @entity256 of helping finance suicide bombings in @entity259			1
he said he was willing to testify , but the plaintiffs never took it seriously			0
the communication was n't relevant to the @entity256 case and ' do n't make clear what his motives are , ' said one lawyer , @entity266			0
' i do n't know his state of mind at all			0
' at @entity137 , @entity268 - known as the ' @entity269 of the @entity270 ' - @entity1 is subject to restrictions requiring screening of any attempt to communicate with the outside world			0
however , there are exceptions for court filings			0
@entity36 has reached out to the @entity4 embassy to the @entity60 for comment			1
previously @entity107 highlighted the findings of the @entity282 report			1
when it was published in 2004 it concluded that it had found ' no evidence that the @entity4 government as an institution or senior @entity4 officials individually funded the organization ' of the attacks			1
at the time @entity107 said : ' the @entity282 has confirmed what we have been saying all along			2
the clear statements by this independent , bipartisan commission have debunked the myths that have cast fear and doubt over @entity4			0
’ the report directly addressed princess @entity16			1
it said : ' we have found no evidence that @entity4 princess @entity302 provided any funds to the conspiracy , either directly or indirectly			2
