you may think that appearing intelligent might be the key to getting a promotion at work			1
but people who want to rise to the top should concentrate on looking healthy , according to a new study			2
researchers found that 70 per cent of the time , a worker with a healthy complexion is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent			1
researchers found that 70 per cent of the time , a worker with a healthy complexion ( pictured right ) is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent ( bottom row )			1
they came to their conclusion after conducting an experiment where participants chose from different faces ( shown ) to pick the leader of a fictional company they discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘ optional extra ’ for workers looking for a pay rise or for politicians seeking election			1
in an experiment by @entity30 , 148 candidates were asked to select a future leader of a fictional firm by choosing between two digitally manipulated photographs of the same man			2
one image was altered to make him look healthier and the other manipulated to make him look cleverer			0
the experiment revealed that seven times out of 10 , the man with the healthy complexion was more appealing than the intelligent looking male			1
‘ here we show that it always pays for aspiring leaders to look healthy , which explains why politicians and executives often put great effort , time , and money in their appearance , ’ said assistant professor @entity41 from the @entity42 at the university			2
the experts discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘ optional extra ’ for workers looking for a raise ( illustrated with a stock image ) or for politicians looking to get elected			1
however , people are more likely to vote for a healthy - looking politician and choose a healthy - looking boss office plants help workers be more creative and productive , which could result in promotion , a @entity62 study claims			2
at work , humble houseplants have been proven to aid concentration , increase productivity and boost staff wellbeing by 47 per cent , according to a study undertaken in december last year			0
the results showed that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent			0
plants have previously been proven to have positive effects in hospitals , where patients with potted plants close by said they experienced less pain , anxiety and tiredness , while houses with plant - filled rooms contain between 50 and 60 per cent fewer bacteria than other rooms without plants			0
‘ if you want to be chosen for a leadership position , looking intelligent is an optional extra under context - specific situations whereas the appearance of health appears to be important in a more context - general way across a variety of situations			1
’ in the experiment , the participants were given a job description that specified the ceo ’s main challenge each time they were asked to choose between the two images			1
job descriptions involved driving aggressive competition , renegotiating a key partnership with another company , leading the company ’s shift into a new market and overseeing the sustained exploitation of non-renewable energy			0
the participants chose more healthy - looking faces over less healthy - looking faces in 69 per cent of trials and this preference was equally strong irrespective of the future ceo ’s main challenge , according to the study published in the access journal @entity123 in @entity124			2
more intelligent - looking faces were only preferred over less intelligent - looking faces for the two challenges that would require the most diplomacy and inventiveness : renegotiating the partnership and exploring the new market			0
the aim of the experiment was to explore people ’s implicit preferences for traits of leaders , such as health , intelligence , and attractiveness			0
the researchers focused on facial traits because these provide a wealth of information about individuals			0
in women as well as men , caring and cooperative personalities are statistically more likely to have a more ‘ feminine ’ face , due to higher oestrogen levels , while aggressive risk - takers tend to have higher testosterone levels and a more ‘ masculine ’ face .			0
