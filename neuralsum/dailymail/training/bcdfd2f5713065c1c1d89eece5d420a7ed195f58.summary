by @entity0 published : 17:49 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 17:49 est , 31 august 2013 profiting from hard times ? many items in the ' @entity4 ' section of @entity6 's new book come from the celebrity chef 's own range of @entity10 utensils @entity6 's mission to get @entity12 to eat well on a budget got off to a controversial start last week when he lambasted working - class families for buying gigantic flatscreen tvs while eating junk food			1
but his new austerity cookbook , which promises ‘ exciting food that ’s not hard on your wallet ’ , might not quite provide the low - cost answers hard - pressed households need			1
home cooks wanting to try all the ‘ money - saving ’ meals in @entity26 with @entity6 would need to spend more than £ 500 on kitchen utensils and food ‘ staples ’ before buying a single main ingredient			1
in the book – which itself costs a wallet - straining £ 26 – @entity6 lists 47 items of equipment needed for the recipes , including a griddle pan , a pestle and mortar and three different kinds of grater , which would cost at least £ 360			1
in addition , @entity6 cites a list of ‘ stock cupboard essentials ’ , including groundnut oil , sesame oil , quinoa , organic yogurt , polenta and kaffir lime leaves			2
when totalled up , the hefty shopping list of 107 foods , spices and oils would cost almost £ 150			0
the @entity55 has calculated the figures for ingredients and equipment using the cheapest alternatives available			0
but most of the items pictured in the ‘ @entity4 ’ section of the book come from the tv chef ’s own range of @entity67 utensils , which come at a hefty premium			2
while a basic food processor – which is required in almost 20 of the book ’s recipes – costs from £ 60 , @entity6 ’s branded version costs £ 150			1
other items on his list include a set of three saucepans that retail at £ 130 , a single griddle pan at £ 67 , three non-stick frying pans for £ 95 , and graters which cost up to £ 20 each			2
@entity6 , who has long been an outspoken food campaigner , was widely condemned last week for his comments about the eating habits of working - class families , when he recalled a scene from one of his previous tv shows which , he said , showed ‘ the mum and the kid eating chips and cheese out of @entity92 containers , and behind them is a massive tv			1
’ ‘ it just did n’t weigh up			0
the interview was to promote his new @entity98 show , @entity99 , which starts tomorrow and is tied in with the supposedly budget cookbook			0
‘ naked chef ’ @entity6 , who is worth an estimated £ 150 million , says he is determined to demonstrate that fresh cooking could be more economical than pre-made convenience food			1
he added : ‘ the fascinating thing for me is that seven times out of ten , the poorest families in this country choose the most expensive way to hydrate and feed their families : the ready meals , the convenience foods ‘ i meet people who say , “ you do n’t understand what it ’s like			0
” i just want to hug them and teleport them to the @entity120 street cleaner who has 25 mussels , ten cherry tomatoes , and a packet of spaghetti for 60p , and knocks out the most amazing pasta			0
you go to @entity128 or @entity129 and they eat well on not much money			0
‘ we ’ve missed out on that in @entity12 , somehow			0
’ shopping list : some of the ' essential ' items from @entity6 's own kitchen range that are touted in the cook book his comments were challenged by the @entity138 , whose head of policy , @entity139 , said : ‘ for many families it ’s low income which gets in the way of healthy eating			1
' as official statistics show , parents of poor children are much less likely to be able to afford fresh fruit for their children			0
’ last night , a spokesman for the chef hit back at the accusations that the @entity6 cookbook is out of touch with the average household ’s budget			1
he said : ‘ @entity6 always puts a list of kitchen kit and store cupboard ingredients in his books as a guide for people and , in fact , we get a lot of positive feedback from readers about those pages			2
‘ of course , as it ’s merely a guide , no one would be expected to buy everything at the same time and , in most cases , readers would find that they probably have a fair few of the items on the lists anyway			2
‘ and of course you do n’t have to buy everything before attempting a recipe or three – you would only have to buy a tiny proportion of the entire list to make some delicious , affordable food which costs , on average , around £ 1.32 per portion			0

celebrity chef @entity6 's austerity cookbook costs an *extravagant* £ 26
it encourages readers to invest in 47 items of equipment needed for recipes
@entity6 was last week *slammed* for comments on working class eating habits
