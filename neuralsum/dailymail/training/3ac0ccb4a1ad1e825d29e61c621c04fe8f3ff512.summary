by @entity0 a seemingly healthy young woman was left paralysed down one side of her body after suffering a major stroke - aged just 20			1
@entity5 , complained of a headache after sunday dinner and went to bed and woke the following morning with no feeling down the left side of her body			1
when she temporarily lost her memory and the ability to even tell the time , doctors declared she had suffered a major stroke			1
shock : @entity5 , 20 , ended up paralysed down her left side after suffering a stroke the news was a huge shock to the fit and active student , who does n't smoke and regularly attended @entity23 classes			1
@entity5 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , was eventually diagnosed with a middle cerebral artery infarct , which is a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain			1
it could have been brought on by kidney condition nephritic syndrome , which can cause blood clotting			0
three months later @entity5 , a graphic design student , has returned home after intensive physiotherapy in @entity25 and @entity34			1
she uses a wheelchair and stick to get around and still has no feeling in her left arm , hand ankle and toes , but is learning how to cope only using her ' good ' side			1
@entity5 said : ' i 'd had a normal day at home on the sunday but after dinner i had a massive headache i could n’t get rid of			1
i went to bed , but could n’t stop shaking			1
support : @entity5 with her boyfriend , @entity47			1
she was so weak when he came to visit her in hospital that she could only give him the ' thumbs up ' sign ' my mum tried to stand me up , but i collapsed			0
i did n’t know what was happening			0
my mouth was drooping and i could n’t move my left arm at all or lift my leg			1
' when i woke up , i was really upset			0
i did n’t understand where i was and then it hit me that i was paralysed			2
currently , almost a third of strokes occur in people under the age of 65 , and this figure is set to rise , according to the @entity63			1
strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked , either through a clot or a bleed			2
anything that raises blood pressure increases this risk , so smoking , alcohol consumption and obesity can all increase your risk of stroke. , whatever your age			2
the contraceptive pill can also increase the risk of stroke , particularly if there ’s a history of high blood pressure within the family			2
pregnancy is another potential risk factor for stroke in young women			2
' my boyfriend came to visit and all i could do was a thumbs up sign			0
i was just staring at him			0
i also lost my memory - i could n’t even tell the time , which was scary			1
' she added : ' it was upsetting because doctors did n’t know if i ’d be the same person i was before			0
' it was scary and really emotional at first			0
it ’s made me realise how much people take things for granted			0
i watch people using both hands and it upsets me			0
you do n’t think you ’ll lose something so big , so young			0
i ’m starting to come to terms with the fact my hand might not ever work again			0
' it ’s a case of getting life back to how it was before , but in a different way			2
' @entity5 now realises a strange episode when her left arm went numb a month earlier could have been a warning sign - and is campaigning for more awareness of stroke in young people			1
on january 5 - a month before the stroke - she went to @entity123 with a numb arm but doctors said it was just a trapped nerve			1
she said : “ at the time , i joked " imagine if it stopped working "			2
i never expected it to actually happen			0
' the doctors did n’t investigate whether it could be a stroke because of my age			1
rehabilitation : three months later @entity5 uses a wheelchair and stick to get around and still has no feeling in her left arm , hand ankle and toes			1
she is learning how to cope only using her ' good ' side ' we think it might have been a warning sign and if doctors had spotted it they could have given me blood thinning drugs			2
' i ’m not angry with the doctors - there just needs to be much more awareness that strokes can happy to 20 year - olds			1
' a stroke is a medical emergency - it 's essential to recognise the early warning signs and call 999 immediately			2
a mini-stroke ( also known as @entity155 or transient ischaemic attack ) is a sign you may be at major risk of having a stroke			2
it ’s symptoms are the same as a stroke , except that they last for a short amount of time and no longer than 24 hours			1
there is a very high risk of going on to have a major stroke within the first few days following a mini-stroke , so it ’s important to get the right treatment fast , says the @entity63			2
the @entity175 test can help identify the signs of a mini-stroke : * facial weakness : can the person smile ? has their mouth or eye drooped ? * @entity181 weakness : can the person raise both arms ? * speech problems : can they speak clearly and understand what you say ? * @entity186 to call 999 @entity5 hopes to go back to her studies at the @entity190 in @entity191 and as a part - time sales assistant job at @entity194			1
' the nurses were brilliant and the physios and occupational therapists were amazing			0
' i was lucky my leg started moving in week three			0
i never thought i ’d have to learn to stand up and walk again			0
' around 75 per cent of strokes affect the over 65s , but @entity5 is keen to raise awareness of the risk to younger people			1
she added : ' i want people to know the symptoms and get checked out if they show signs of any			0
' do n’t assume that just because you ’re young , it wo n’t happen			0
' it ’s scary to think i nearly died but you just have to get on with it			0
you learn to not take things for granted			0
i ’m stronger than i was before			0
' @entity5 ’s boyfriend @entity214 , 21 , and friend @entity215 , 21 , are running 30km in june to raise money for the @entity217			1

@entity5 had a headache and could n't stop shaking
she also had a numb arm the month before , dismissed *due* to her age
on the day of the stroke , she lost her memory and could n't tell the time
three months on , is still paralysed down left side and *rebuilding* her life
wants to raise awareness that strokes do n't just affect the elderly
