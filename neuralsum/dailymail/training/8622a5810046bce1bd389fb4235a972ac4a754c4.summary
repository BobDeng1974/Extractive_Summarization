by @entity0 the @entity1 returns with a bang this thursday as the @entity4 head west to take on the reigning @entity6 champion @entity7			1
the @entity4 will be looking to avenge the infamous ‘ @entity9 ’ defeat in 2012 , during which the replacement refs awarded the @entity7 a controversial game - winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter			1
the task is a formidable one for @entity15 and co. the @entity7 boast an impressive home record , that 's seen them taste defeat just once over the last two seasons at @entity20			0
however , the @entity4 head to the @entity23 with both quarterback @entity15 and linebacker @entity21 fully fit following their injury struggles last season			1
the return of the pair , who are looked upon as the cornerstones of this @entity4 team , will no doubt boost @entity4 they look to improve on their 10 - 6 record over the @entity7			1
up first : the @entity6 champion @entity7 will begin the season against the @entity4 unlike many previous @entity6 champions that have fallen victim to the rigours of free agency and the cap , the @entity7 have retained the vast majority of their stars			1
defensive stars @entity43 and @entity45 penned new deals during the off - season and both will look to continue the formidable legacy of the ' legion of boom '			0
but it 's not all been golden handshakes and smiles in @entity54 , with running back @entity55 holding out for a few days			0
coach @entity57 ’s strength in depth has also been affected with @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 moving on			0
@entity62 has been nothing short of outstanding in pre-season and you can be certain that the @entity7 will be opening up the playbook more than we 've been used to seeing			2
infamous : the contest between these two teams in 2012 saw a controversial win for the @entity7 uproar : the @entity4 were left furious at the decision to award @entity54 a game - winning touchdown battle : @entity54 receiver @entity75 and @entity4 's @entity76 both fought over the same ball @entity78 missed the vast majority of his debut season with the team , but with a full pre-season schedule behind him , the former @entity83 receiver is set to torment opposition defences with his combination of speed and playmaking ability			1
@entity89 , @entity90 has also been a standout during the summer months and should fill the void left by @entity75			0
but the @entity4 also boast an impressive receiving duo in @entity93 and @entity94 , who combined for 1747 yards and 12 touchdowns last term , and let ’s not forget that their work was complimented by @entity99 , who contributed 681 yards and three touchdowns			2
as impressive as the statistics read , the @entity4 would be forgiven for straying away from the obvious threat thought the air , especially against a passing defense that was ranked no 1 overall , in favour of a punishing ground game			2
@entity108 carried the team during @entity15 ’ absence , amassing 1178 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns at 4.1 yards per carry last season			0
@entity108 has the skills to take advantage of a @entity7 running defense that surrendered an average of 101.6 yards per game			2
raring to go : @entity15 is back for @entity4 after missing a large part of last season through injury defensively , the @entity4 have somewhat addressed concerns within the secondary by re-signing cornerback @entity123 , who performed at a consistently high level throughout last season			2
along with @entity123 the @entity4 added first - round draft pick @entity126 , who may be used in rotation to begin with , but if the college tape holds up , it 'll be sooner rather than later before he becomes the starting safety			0
the question still remains for @entity4 fans - can this team stay healthy for the long haul , and recover from their recent play - off heartbreak ? and for the ‘ 12th man ’ in @entity54 , is this the beginning of a dynasty ? can @entity57 ’s charge repeat their success from last season			1
it ’s a tough ask - no team has successfully defended the @entity6 since the @entity145 in 2004 and 2005			1
to have your say on the @entity1 , listen to the @entity149 's live call in show on sundays from 4pm			0
