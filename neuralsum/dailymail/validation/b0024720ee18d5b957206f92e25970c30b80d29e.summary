two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in @entity3			2

mr @entity40 added that his family had an ' extraordinary history ' and he also had an uncle who had been held in @entity45 ' detention camp in @entity46 , @entity47			0
the ruling prevents the teenager , who has dual @entity51 and @entity52 citizenship , from leaving @entity53 and @entity54			0
mr @entity55 , who said the four fighters could not be named , added : ' the local authority 's anxiety here is that ( the teenager ) may wish to follow the path which his brothers have walked			1
' he also heard that council staff had learned that family members were making plans for the teenager to go on a trip to @entity67 during the @entity69 holiday			0
mr @entity55 said he was concerned to ' keep this lad alive ' and said an order which barred from travelling abroad was proportionate			1
' [ the teenager ] is a vulnerable young person			0
he has grown up in modern @entity52 in an extraordinary family - a family where the male members are patently committed to waging @entity77 in war - torn @entity3 , ' he said			1
he told the court he had balanced the teenager 's human rights and added : ' the balance falls clearly in protecting this young man , ultimately from himself			2
' mr @entity55 made the ruling after social services at @entity13 ( headquarters pictured ) raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers ' footsteps and travel to the war - torn region the boy 's mother , who he lives with , is said to be was ' exhausted by grief ' and there were concerns that she was unable to place ' proper boundaries ' around him			1
mr @entity55 said the council had considered asking for the teenager to be taken into care but given the boy 's age , staff thought making him a ward of court would be a better option			1
the judge said by becoming a ward of court the youngster would come under the protection of a judge and added : ' a child who is a ward of court may not be removed from @entity53 and @entity54 without the court 's permission			1
' mr @entity40 said the teenager 's father was thought to be in @entity51 and that the teenager was ' disaffected ' and was not ' properly engaging ' at school			0
he told the court the boy had been involved in fighting and was currently on police bail after being arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm			0
the judge was told that the mother was aware of her son 's planned trip to @entity67			2
she hoped that the trip would ' get him away ' from his local area where he had been getting into trouble			0
mr @entity40 said it was thought that the teenager 's brothers had left the @entity52 after telling their mother that they needed passports for a ' school project '			1
mr @entity55 said he was ' sympathetic ' to the teenager 's mother , adding it was not difficult to see why the teenager might feel aggrieved and have a sense of injustice			0
lawyers said it was thought this was the first time a family court judge had been asked to take such an approach to prevent a boy going to fight in @entity3			1
the group , which is also referred to as @entity31 , formed in january 2012 during the @entity153 and made its announcement as extremists through an online video			0
it quickly rose to prominence among rebel organisations in @entity3 for its reliable supply of arms , funding , and fighters from a combination of foreign donors and @entity166			2
@entity31 , which means support in @entity168 , was also the first @entity3 force to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks that killed civilians			2
in 2013 the militant group , designated as a terrorist organisation by the @entity175 , made an allegiance to @entity34 commander @entity177 , claiming it was part of its network and denying any affiliations with @entity166			0
despite @entity177 's public denial of the merger , a number of @entity31 fighters defected to @entity166 , furthering tension between the groups			0
by march last year , over 3,000 fighters had been killed in battles between @entity166 and @entity31			0
the group 's videos and statements are regularly posted to social media such as @entity193 and video - sharing sites through media group , @entity195			2
