by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 10 december 2013 @entity1 has reignited his war of words with sir @entity4 with a withering series of remarks about the former @entity8 boss			1
@entity1 opens up on his bitter exit from @entity10 and the breakdown of his relationship with @entity4 in an @entity14 documentary to be screened on tuesday night			1
he talks of @entity4 ’s methods of ' power and control ' and his ' massive ego ' , hails @entity19 as ' without a doubt ' the best manager he worked for and omits @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 when choosing the finest @entity8 team from his former team - mates			1
biting back : @entity1 has laid into sir @entity4 , @entity22 , @entity24 and more @entity1 brands @entity24 ‘ the weakest link ’ and , in reference to @entity22 , says : ‘ having a great career does n’t mean you ’re a great player			1
’ included in his team instead of @entity4 ’s favourites are rebels who fell out with the former @entity8 manager , including @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
‘ you do n’t win league titles by having choirboys in your dressing room , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ these boys did challenge the manager in different ways			2
@entity37 challenged the manager but because you marry a certain woman it does n’t mean you ’re challenging the manager			2
‘ the manager ’s got to understand that			2
we ’ve got different personalities in our dressing room but maybe that ’s why we ’re winning trophies			0
’ egotistical ? @entity1 denies much of what sir @entity4 said about him in his autobiography rift : the relationship between @entity37 and sir @entity4 declined until @entity37 moved on clashes : @entity38 and @entity35 ( right ) were also among those to fall out with sir @entity4 @entity4 ’s retirement earlier this year has enabled @entity1 to return and watch the team , eight years after his @entity8 career ended			1
‘ i felt raw when i left , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ i ’ve eased off now a bit in terms of the bad feeling i had towards them			0
‘ it helps that @entity4 has gone and i ’ve got a couple of season tickets with my son and we go and watch them as much as we can			2
‘ so i have that warmth towards @entity8 once again and it did leave me for a couple of years , which i feel bad saying because in every minute of every day i spent at that football club i really enjoyed it			0
i feel very fortunate to have played for them			0
’ influential : but @entity1 left @entity8 in 2005/2006 , and admits he shed tears over leaving not a great player : @entity22 ( right ) remains a @entity87 player with @entity8 at the age of 40 it was november 2005 , when @entity4 summoned the @entity90 and told him it was time to go following the storm which surrounded @entity1 's critical but never - to - be - broadcast comments about the team on @entity95 , the club 's in - house channel			1
‘ the manager told me we ’d come to the end and i said , “ you ’re right ” , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ i ’d obviously lost respect for him and he ’d lost respect for me			0
what would be best for @entity8 , if they thought i was some sort of loose cannon , was to leave			0
i got my boots and drove out			0
do n’t think i ’m some sort of machine here			0
i was upset of course , and i did shed a few tears in my car outside the training ground for about two minutes , but also i told myself i needed to get on with my life			0
‘ @entity4 thanked me for my 11 - and - a - half years at the club and i had to remind him i ’d been at @entity8 for 12 - and - a - half years			1
again , i think this was all part of the game , you know			0
two words the manager spoke to me about a number of times were “ control ” and “ power ” and that was how he worked			1
we can still see that now even though he ’s not a manager			0
i do n’t think that will ever leave him			0
fall out : @entity135 ( left ) and @entity1 once famously clashed in the tunnel before @entity8 played @entity137 ‘ there is massive ego involved in that you have power and control over people and you try and have it even when you ’re not working with them			1
’ @entity1 criticises @entity4 ’s conduct in his racehorse dispute with former @entity8 shareholder @entity148 , saying : ‘ if people do n’t think that had a negative effect on the club then they ’re living in cuckoo land			1
’ and he rejects accusations from @entity4 ’s book that he was a fading force on the pitch and trying to assume managerial responsibilities			2
he also denies the manager ’s version of events regarding the @entity95 interview			0
‘ just because @entity4 says it does n’t mean it ’s the truth , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ really , what would have helped everybody is if they had just played the damn video			0
as they are now : but when they played , @entity1 feared @entity24 ( right ) was @entity8 's weak link ‘ the manager has accused me of trying to manage @entity8 behind his back but what i did do , i managed the dressing room			1
i tried to nail players who stepped out of line			0
‘ i never felt for one second i was more important than the manager			0
‘ i could have played for @entity8 easily for another couple of years in the middle of the park			0
’ @entity1 describes his relationship these days with @entity4 as ‘ obviously non-existent ’			1
asked if he felt let down , he says : ‘ nothing surprises me with that man			0
’ asked who was the best manager he played for , @entity1 answers : ‘ without a doubt , @entity19			1
’ the questioner adds : ‘ not sir @entity4 , ’ and he replies : ‘ you asked me the question , i answered you			2
’ managerial mastermind : @entity1 insists that @entity19 ( right ) is the best manager he has worked under the documentary @entity1 and @entity135 : best of enemies will be shown on tuesday at 10pm on @entity196			1
it is compelling viewing as the former captains of @entity8 and @entity137 meet to discuss the days when their teams would fight , sometimes literally , for the @entity87 title			0
among the epic games recounted is the highly charged clash at @entity204 in 2005 , defined by a pre-match row between the two captains in the @entity204 tunnel , triggered when @entity135 tried to intimidate @entity24			2
‘ what really annoyed me that night was			0
that you were picking on @entity24 , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ i was looking at @entity210 and @entity211 and i ’m thinking you were almost picking on the weakest link			1
‘ so that ’s what got my back up			0
’ @entity216 to head : @entity1 and @entity135 repeatedly clashed both on and off the field talking point : one of the great debates of the @entity87 era is who of the two was the better player @entity135 bemoans @entity137 ’s lack of leadership in the trophy - free years since his departure and reveals how he tried to persuade @entity226 not to sell @entity227			1
‘ i tried to fight it a little bit because i wanted him to stay , ’ explains @entity135			0
‘ @entity227 was supposed to be the next @entity137 captain because he was a player from the youth , grew up at the club and to let him go and see him go , i was disappointed			2
’ most compelling of all , however , is @entity1 ’s assessment of @entity4 .			1

@entity4 had a ' massive ego ' and used methods of ' power and control '
@entity19 is best boss @entity1 ever worked with
brands *ex-united* team - mate @entity24 ' the weakest link '
on @entity22 , @entity1 says : ' having a great career does *n't* mean you *'re* a great player '
