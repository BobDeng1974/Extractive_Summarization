former @entity1 captain @entity0 is urging the @entity2 to give @entity3 the opportunity to finish the job of turning @entity1 into world - beaters			1
the first batch of @entity1 players began the journey home from @entity11 on monday following the team 's failure to reach the final of the 2014 @entity15			1
narrow back - to - back defeats at the hands of @entity18 and @entity11 , who will contest saturday 's final in @entity20 , resulted in an all - too familiar outcome for the national team , who lost in the last 20 seconds of the @entity25 semi-final 12 months ago and have not won a major series since @entity27 thrashed a weakened @entity28 touring team in 2007			1
@entity0 is urging the @entity2 to give @entity3 the opportunity to finish the job although @entity3 remains under contract for another 12 months , his position has been undermined by a record of just one win in nine matches against the @entity38 heavyweights since he succeeded @entity39 in 2010			1
another former national captain , @entity40 , has called for @entity3 to stand down , with @entity42 's @entity41 his choice to take over , while @entity45 's @entity44 and @entity46 , of @entity47 , have been touted for the job			2
however , @entity0 , who won 30 caps for @entity1 and @entity27 before retiring from the international game in 2012 , is convinced @entity3 remains the right man for the job after laying the foundations for success and believes the visit of @entity11 for a three - match @entity26 next autumn can help him prove it			1
' it 's an exciting time for that team when you look how many players are world class and how many are on the cusp of being world class , ' @entity0 said			2
' that 's testimony to the environment that @entity3 and his coaching staff have created over the last five years to enable players to reach their potential			2
' as a coach , you 've got to get the performance right and i feel this team is as competitive with the @entity38 sides as any we 've had over the last 15 years			0
' i came back from the 2008 @entity25 with a sense that we were a million miles away and also when i looked at the team in 2010 i thought @entity1 were some way away from beating @entity11 and @entity18			2
' now that clearly is n't the case any more			0
' we were 20 seconds away from a @entity25 final and a finger tip away from beating @entity18			0
there 's a fine line , we 're not a million miles away			0
' the squad will be a year older and a year wiser against @entity11 next year and i think that is a series @entity89 needs to win			0
' this team is going to flourish			0
there is an opportunity , especially with @entity18 being in transition , for @entity1 to become a great side in the next five or six years			0
' @entity3 has been tasked with the job of turning @entity1 into world - beaters @entity3 reverted to being part - time after last year 's @entity25 and was re-appointed despite taking a job as assistant coach at @entity99			1
the @entity2 has been widely criticised over that decision but @entity0 believes there are advantages to having a @entity104 - based @entity1 coach , especially with seven members of his 24 - man squad also plying their trade in the @entity108			1
' the @entity1 job is a part - time role and i think it 's good that they 've got a coach behind enemy lines , analysing what the @entity116 do , ' he said			2
' both the @entity11 and @entity116 coaches are part - time and we 've got the advantage over them with a performance director in @entity122 who is based in @entity1 but working closely with @entity89			1
' @entity0 , who returned for pre-season training with @entity47 on monday , worked as pundit for the @entity125 on the @entity15 and would like to see organisers capitalise on its success and in particular the impact made by debutants @entity130			2
@entity131 ( left ) taking a hit during @entity1 's 16 - 14 @entity15 defeat against @entity11 on saturday ' it 's been a fantastic tournament , going into the last round of games with all four teams able to qualify for the final , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity130 played a full part in that and they need to keep that momentum up by maybe playing @entity18 when we 're playing @entity11 but i 'd like to see @entity1 go and play @entity130 in the middle of the year as part of the build - up to the @entity11 series			1
' @entity0 says an @entity1 - @entity130 clash could be held @entity151 on the weekend of the @entity152 next may , which will mark the centenary of the 1915 @entity155 landings , and believes @entity157 clubs should throw their weight behind it			1
' there is a ruling out there that you have to go and play international football if you are selected , ' he said			0
' the players are spread out among different clubs now and they would just have to cope that weekend without those players			0
there would be several of them playing in the @entity108 any way			0
' it would be a cracking fixture			0
the international board needs to be pro-active and make it happen			0

@entity1 lost 16 - 14 against @entity11 in the @entity15
but former captain @entity0 has faith in @entity3
@entity3 still has 12 months to run on his contract as head coach
