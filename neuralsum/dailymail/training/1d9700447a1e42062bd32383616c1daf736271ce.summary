a new debate has broken out between some of the world 's top shakespeare experts over whether the playwright 's sonnets prove he was attracted to men			1
sir @entity7 , a visiting professor at @entity8 , began the row by condemning a book review which suggested @entity11 appears in a ' primarily homosexual context '			1
in a letter to the @entity14 , he said the claim was ' anachronistic ' because scholars now accept there were forms of rhetoric that allowed men to express love without implying sexual attraction			1
professor sir @entity7 started the debate over playwright @entity25 's ( pictured ) sexuality after condemning a book review which suggested @entity11 appears in a ' primarily homosexual context ' he also said that any attempt to find biographical information in the sonnets was doomed because @entity25 was a professional who wrote under the identity of a ' poet - persona '			1
fellow academics have since hit back at mr @entity7 ' comments , accusing him of promoting ' one of the great fallacies of modern @entity25 criticism '			1
scholar @entity38 , who described himself as a ' friendly acquaintance ' of mr @entity7 when responding to him via the letters page , accused him of introducing ' presuppositions that many of us would question , if not reject out of hand '			1
he wrote : ' i can not think of any responsible editor ... who would dismiss the premise of homosexual , as well as heterosexual passion pervading [ the sonnets ]			2
' why should @entity25 alone be thought so committed to the " negative capability " of his dramatic craft that all his most personal writings are treated as potentially artificial ? ' and even if we insist on regarding the sonnets , wholly or in part , as a kind of long - term dramatic narrative ... why on earth would @entity25 choose so often to impersonate a pathetically ageing , balding , lame and vulnerable bisexual suitor , abjectly whingeing about rejection and betrayal — unless the self - humiliation that surfaces again and again through these particulars were both genuine and cathartic ? ' love : @entity25 ( @entity67 ) with his mistress @entity68 ( @entity69 ) in the 1998 blockbuster film @entity70			1
when he first falls in love with her , she is dressed as a boy to act on stage there are long - standing debates over whether the poet was gay or bisexual			1
pictured : the @entity78 another academic , who wrote under the name professor @entity81 , also responded to the letter , pointing out that @entity25 used at least one sonnet to woo @entity84			1
he said : ' when a poet whose name is @entity25 writes poems of anguished and unabashed sexual frankness which pun on the word " will " — 13 times in [ @entity92 ] no 135 ... it is not unreasonable to conclude that he may be writing from the depths of his own experience			2
' let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments			0
love is not love which alters when it alteration finds , or bends with the remover to remove : o no ; it is an ever - fixed mark , that looks on tempests , and is never shaken ; it is the star to every wandering bark , whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken			2
love 's not @entity114 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle 's compass come ; love alters not with his brief hours and weeks , but bears it out even to the edge of doom			2
if this be error and upon me proved , i never writ , nor no man ever loved			2
mr @entity7 responded by saying he could not stop people from speculating , adding : ' thought is free			1
' but if you fix these codes and then say that his 126 poems are like this , then people stop reading them as poems			0
they read them as biographical documents , looking for imputed sexuality			2
' he said there was ' no bad blood ' but has written a second letter in which he claims professor @entity81 has too much insight into @entity25 's motives			1
' such figments of the critic 's imagination not only produce quantities of waste paper but ... are inimical to the proper reading of poetry , ' he said			2
the row is the latest debate over the sexuality of the playwright			1
the first edition of his sonnets were dedicated to a ' mr @entity158 ' , whose identity has never been proven - leading to claims it could have been a male lover			1
the most likely candidates were often thought to have been his friends @entity165 , @entity166 , or @entity167 , @entity168			0
@entity169 explored a different theory , writing a fictional 1889 story about whether it could be a cross-dressing boy actor called @entity173 - and the same person as the ' fair youth ' of the sonnets			0
that could also help explain punning references to the name ' will ' , it was claimed			0
although there are few references to anything other than noble love , some sonnets appear more explicit than others			2
sonnet 20 is largely interpreted as being dedicated to a man , declaring : ' a woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted / @entity194 thou , the master mistress of my passion			1
' in 2012 , @entity198 actor sir @entity197 boldly announced that there was absolutely ' no doubt ' the bard was bisexual			1
in 2012 , shakespearean actor sir @entity197 ( pictured ) boldly announced that there was absolutely ' no doubt ' the playwright preferred sex with men			1
he came to his conclusion after studying the poet 's work @entity197 said @entity25 's @entity210 ( the film version is pictured ) referenced homosexuality @entity214 star said he was adamant @entity25 preferred sex with men even though he was married with children			1
the 75 - year - old acclaimed thespian said he came to his conclusion after studying the @entity220 poet 's work			0
at the time , he said : ' i 'd say @entity25 slept with men			1
' @entity210 , centering on how the world treats gays as well as @entity225 , has a love triangle between an older man , younger man and a woman			0
' and the complexity in his comedies with cross-dressing and disguises is immense			0
' @entity25 obviously enjoyed sex with men as well as women			1
' it is widely accepted that @entity25 married 26 - year - old @entity84 when he was 18			2
six months after the marriage , @entity84 gave birth to a daughter , @entity240 , who was baptised on may 26 , 1583			0
twins , son @entity242 and daughter @entity243 , followed almost two years later and were baptised on february 2 , 1585			0
speculation : @entity245 relied on male favourites @entity169 called gay attraction ' the love that dare not speak its name ' , and that 's one of the reasons why it has sparked so many debates - it just is n't written down			1
instead of the modern references to same - sex love found in everything from poems to @entity259 , authors danced around the subject and rarely made their intentions clear			0
even in the early 1900s gay authors such as @entity263 and @entity264 censored themselves , only releasing full accounts towards the end of their lives - and in the case of @entity263 's @entity270 , after they were dead			0
@entity272 @entity271 is more complicated			0
@entity273 500 years ago had more fluid ideas about gender , with cross-dressing actors and a more lavish , flamboyant dress sense for men			0
that makes it more difficult for scholars to work out whether authors were talking about sexual attraction , or just love between friends			0
@entity286 's 1593 play about @entity245 examined the king 's relationship with his ' favourite ' @entity290 , never spelling out long - held rumours that the pair went further than friendship			2
but there are strong hints as his wife @entity296 proclaims : ' he 'll ever dote on @entity290 ; and so am i for ever miserable			0
' and the king is killed with a red - hot poker , which @entity301 writers later claimed was inserted into his anus as an act of retribution			0
@entity272 authors were also reliant on @entity307 texts , which had very different ideas about gay sex than those which are discussed today			0
sex between older and younger men - ' pederasty ' - was common in @entity315 , but homosexuality was not seen as a permanent state of mind			0
instead it was seen as a temporary relationship , of a different type to that between a man and a woman , which came to an end when the younger man matured and went out to find a wife .			0
