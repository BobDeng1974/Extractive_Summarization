but this is the woman who inspired one of @entity11 ’s greatest songwriters and helped launch his career to international stardom			1
the humdrum life she now leads in a quiet welsh - speaking village gives little clue that @entity19 ’s name is known to millions worldwide			1
@entity19 is the woman who inspired one of @entity11 's greatest songwriters and helped launch his career to international stardom @entity22 - half of famous duo @entity21 - was once so besotted with @entity25 teenager that they appeared together on his first record cover			1

it is in stark contrast to the singer turmoil he has endured this week as @entity21 , 72 , appeared in court alongside his third wife after police were called to break up a violent dispute at their home			1
@entity22 - half of famous duo @entity21 - was once so besotted with @entity25 teenager that they appeared together on his first record cover half a decade on from when he first met @entity58 , the 68 - year - old grandmother with her grey hair tied back in a bun , still bears a strong resemblance to the teenage girl that won his heart			1

@entity21 , who had dropped out of @entity73 law school , had decided to tour @entity25 ’s pubs and clubs after struggling to make a name for himself in @entity11			1

‘ @entity11 is the one [ hit song ] which we ’ll never escape from because it ’s a song about @entity11 losing its way			0
’ at 68 , miss @entity19 still retains her 5ft4in boyish figure , huge eyes and sensitive features			1
her hair is now grey but still cut in the same bob as when pictured sat on cobblestones playing with toys alongside @entity21 on his first album , the @entity154 , released in 1965			2
despite being of retirement age , she remains a part - time administrator at a technical college – the same job she has had for more than 25 years			2
ironically , she still has requests for interviews from music biographers across the world about her time with @entity21 , but all they have received is the sound of silence			1
‘ @entity167 always was and remains a private person , ’ added mr @entity111 , a former local journalist , on her behalf			0
‘ she has never spoken publicly about her past and while understanding that there is a huge public interest in this matter , has no intention to do so			0
’ a friend told the @entity176 : ‘ the break - up ( with @entity21 ) was very traumatic			1
it was ultimately a world that did n’t do @entity89 any favours			0
she simply could n’t cope with the public attention			2
