today the @entity18 rejected calls from senior backbencher @entity20 for an internal investigation into the claims			2
@entity23 has weighed in behind him , saying the prime minister accepts his assurances that he did not make the comments to journalists he encountered in a @entity29 restaurant last week			1
but some senior @entity30 last night cast doubt on his denials , and he faced close interrogation over the affair when the @entity18 board held its monthly meeting in @entity37 this afternoon			2
ahead of the meeting mr @entity20 said : ‘ i simply do not believe that senior journalists would make up such a remark			1
‘ i ’m afraid that among the leadership there has been a disdainful view of the voluntary party			2
i have made that complaint again and again			2
‘ i am certainly going to be raising it at the party board meeting – it is so insulting			2
’ former conservative cabinet minister @entity50 said @entity3 should follow through on his threat to sue if he genuinely did not use the contemptuous phrase			1
mr @entity50 said : ‘ he strenuously denies it but , if so , i have to say as a former lawyer			1
where is the writ ? i think we will find the writ will not appear			2
’ newspaper accounts on saturday did not name @entity3 , but said the source of the story had ‘ strong social connections to the prime minister and close links to the party machine ’			1
lord @entity3 is reported to have dismissed last week ’s @entity4 rebellion on @entity68 , saying : ‘ it ’s fine – there ’s really no problem			1
the mps just have to do it because the associations tell them to do it , and the associations are all mad , swivel - eyed loons			0
’ hours later @entity3 issued a statement denying he had made the comments , after he was named on @entity79 as the likely source			1
' where 's the writ ? ' : former conservative cabinet minister @entity50 said @entity3 should follow through on his threat to sue if he genuinely did not use the contemptuous phrase he said : ‘ this is completely untrue			1
i did not nor have ever described our associations in this way or in any similar manner			0
nor do these alleged comments represent my views of our activists			1
’ @entity3 , 47 , is one of the prime minister ’s closest political allies			1
the pair met at @entity95 and have remained friends and tennis partners for years			0
lord @entity3 was made co-chairman of the party in 2010 and handed a peerage later that year			1
@entity23 said mr @entity15 backed his friend and believed his denials			0
a no 10 source said : ‘ we absolutely believe @entity105			0
it is completely untrue that anyone in @entity23 has made those comments or held those views			2
’ another senior figure close to the discussions about @entity3 acknowledged he could be a ‘ bit of a blabbermouth ’ , but insisted he would not lie			1
the source added : ‘ did he say something a bit injudicious ? possibly			0
did he say what ’s been ascribed to him ? nobody thinks so			0
‘ he insists that he did not say those words			0
@entity105 is nothing if not honest			0
the prime minister has known him for years and he believes his account			0
’ friends : lord @entity3 is one of the prime minister @entity15 's closest political allies the @entity125 and the @entity126 , which both reported the story on their front pages on saturday , said they stood by their stories			1
@entity130 , director of the organisation @entity132 , said there was now a ‘ crisis of conservatism ’ , with the leadership disconnected from the party on issues like gay marriage and @entity68			0
mr @entity150 said : ‘ it does n’t matter who made these comments , the problem is that it comes as no surprise and is representative of a wider malaise in the party – the disconnect between the leadership and the grassroots , between conservatism and the leadership of the @entity18			2
‘ the tail can not continue to wag the dog			0
we need to drop or heavily amend policies like gay marriage that are n’t conservative			0
’ senior @entity30 last night said there was unlikely to be any action against @entity3			1
one said : ‘ even if he did say it , which he denies , the fact is @entity105 is the prime minister ’s friend and confidante			0
he also raises a lot of money for the central party and keeps the @entity15 operation afloat			0
‘ we literally can not afford to lose him , which is what makes the whole thing so complicated and difficult			0
’ mr @entity50 suggested the prime minister was wrong to appoint a personal friend to such a senior role			1
‘ i am old enough to remember the days when the @entity4 chairman was a serious political figure and chosen because they were a serious political figure , ’ he said			0
‘ if it was him – as newspapers suggest – then this has been a disaster waiting to happen because you can not elevate tennis - playing friends to be chairman of the @entity18 without there being a political price to pay			0
