@entity0 believes @entity1 is ' clearly bitter ' , and must set aside his own @entity3 disappointment for the good of his @entity6 team at the start of their @entity8 year			1
@entity1 claimed on wednesday that @entity6 's decision to replace him as captain with @entity11 , at the 11th hour before the global tournament in @entity13 and @entity14 , was proved ' probably wrong ' by subsequent events			1
@entity6 made an embarrassing early exit at the hands of @entity18 , before the knockout stages were under way			0
@entity1 was replaced as @entity22 's one - day captain before this year 's @entity3 former captain @entity0 interprets @entity1 's remarks as a sign that he is still struggling to come to terms with what happened after losing his 50 - over role because of his continued poor batting form			1
@entity1 will nonetheless lead @entity6 in three tests against the @entity31 , on a tour starting early next month , before returning home to face first @entity14 and then @entity13 this summer			2
@entity34 pundit @entity0 said : ' he 's clearly bitter			2
' i think that 's a bad mentality to have , when you think he 's going to be back leading the team in a couple of weeks ' time			0
' @entity1 led @entity6 to a @entity43 final on home soil two years ago , and the top of the world rankings , but their recent one - day international record under him deteriorated			1
@entity0 added : ' @entity1 's last six captaincy jobs in ( @entity50 ) series for @entity6 , he lost every single one			1
' the only series they 've won was away in the @entity31 , when he was n't the captain			0
' @entity0 claims @entity1 is ' bitter ' about the decision to replace him as captain @entity1 could only watch from afar as @entity6 beat only @entity57 and @entity58 in their @entity3 campaign under @entity11 , but he sensed they were ' shell - shocked ' and in need of ' real leadership '			1
@entity0 argues @entity1 must move on , and start scoring prolifically again - as he has for the vast majority of his record - breaking career			2
' i do n't think it 's great that the captain comes out and criticises the leadership of the captain that takes over - but he 's clearly bitter			2
' he 's got to clear that out of his head , because it 's so important that by the time he gets to the @entity31 @entity6 need him scoring runs			0
' he has to score runs in the @entity75 ; he has to get runs against @entity14 - so by the time the @entity8 arrive in july , no one is talking about @entity1 's position in the test team			0
' he has n't scored a hundred in any format of the game for two years			0
that has to change in the @entity31			0
