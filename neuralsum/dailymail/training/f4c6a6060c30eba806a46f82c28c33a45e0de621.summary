by @entity0 a former soap actor has told how he transformed his body in just twelve weeks , losing 34lbs in weight and nine inches from his waist			1
@entity5 – who played stripper @entity6 in @entity7 – went from being a ‘ gut bucket ’ to having his dream @entity11 body by following a strict diet and doing short - burst , high - intensity workouts			1
he documented his weight loss in a series of pictures taken weekly as his body got more and more toned			1
before getting into shape , mr @entity5 would eat up to eight @entity28 bars a day – with 218 calories in each bar , this meant he was eating 1,744 calories of chocolate a day			1
he decided to make changes to his lifestyle but even as he was pumping iron and working out daily at the gym , he admits there was the occasional lapse			0
early on , he says that he cracked and ate two family - sized packs of @entity42 in one 4,300 calorie binge			1
however , after that he knuckled down and lost 34lbs – going down from 14st 6lb to 12st – and his waist measurement went down from 37in to just 28in			1
perhaps most startling of all was his reduction in body fat – from 23 per cent to just 3 per cent			1
he documented his weight loss in a series of pictures taken weekly as his body got more and more toned the 38 - year - old said : ‘ i looked awful before i lost the weight			1
i was incredibly lethargic and completely ashamed of my man boobs and pot belly			0
‘ i had always been proud of my body and had worked as a fitness trainer keeping stars like @entity59 in shape			1
‘ but i had let myself go big - time			2
chocolate was my big weakness and i would not think twice about scoffing eight kit @entity63 in a day			0
‘ i ’d just eat one after another , nibbling off the chocolate first before scoffing the wafer			0
‘ it took its toll on my body and i ended up in the worst shape of my life			2
’ as a result , at @entity71 , mr @entity5 set himself task - get a body like a model by the start of the summer and record the whole painful process in a series of photographs			1
mr @entity5 believes a key factor in his body transformation was his daily use of @entity83 ’ fat burning and recovery pills - @entity85 diet capsules in particular			1
now he has achieved his goal – and proudly showed off his new body			2
mr @entity5 is pictured ( left ) just before he started his diet and exercise regime			1
he is pictured ( right ) at the end of the first month of the programme he is pictured ( left ) after dieting for six weeks			2
he is also seen ( right ) at the end of the second month he said : ‘ i did n’t just want to look good , i wanted to look amazing			1
‘ i could n’t believe it when i saw the pictures			0
i ’d achieved all my goals and vowed that i would never get out of shape again			0
‘ i would have lost more weight but i ’d bulked up with lots more muscle , which is heavier than fat			2
’ however , he admitted that it was tough cutting back on his chocolate intake			0
he said : ‘ i started off determined to stick rigidly to an ultra-low sugar and low fat diet			2
‘ i tried this approach for five days after which i caved in and smashed two family - sized packs of @entity42			2
mr @entity5 ( pictured in @entity7 in 2000 ) has now lost 34lbs - going down from 14st 6lb to 12st - and reduced his waist measurement from 37in to just 28in			1
he believes in that taking daily fat burning and recovery pills by @entity83 supplements also helped ‘ it was a case of going straight back to the drawing board			0
‘ i can be incredibly weak - willed			2
my mind plays tricks on me and i have a constant devil on my shoulder telling me to do the wrong thing , “ eat this , drink that ”			0
’ after this setback , mr @entity5 stuck rigidly to a diet regime – he did two 20 minutes high intensity workouts during the week , before and after work , and ate carefully before taking a more relaxed approach at weekends			1
he explained : ‘ i knew i needed a slightly more realistic regime			2
‘ i have literally had to nurse myself through this whole thing and treat myself like an adult teaching a naughty child			0
before getting into shape , mr @entity5 would eat up to eight kit @entity135 bars a day - with 218 calories in each bar , this meant he was eating 1,744 calories of chocolate a day ‘ i would eat a fairly strict diet throughout the week and then not put pressure on myself at weekends			1
if i wanted to eat crap , i would			0
if i did eat crap , i had to go to the gym or a run afterwards			0
‘ the key point for me was not to feel hungry			0
that is when i would reach for the chocolate in the past			0
‘ what worked for me was cutting my carbohydrate intake right down after noon and replacing it with a slightly higher fat intake – whole eggs and fattier cuts of meat			0
‘ i made sure i had my fruit and natural sugars in the mornings and i always ate greens a few times a day			0
‘ added to this , i drank as much water as possible – between three and four litres daily , and i did n’t leave more than three hours between meals			0
