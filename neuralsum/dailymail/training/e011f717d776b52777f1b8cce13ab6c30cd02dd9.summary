by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity3 armoured vehicles firing heavy machine guns and supported by scores of special forces soldiers yesterday stormed one of the last two remaining @entity9 bases still holding out in @entity1			1
the brutal assault at @entity11 at @entity12 , which left up to four wounded , was the first real clash involving the two countries ’ armies since the @entity3 invaded the region four weeks ago			1
i watched as an armoured vehicle smashed through the walls of the base			1
it was followed by squads of soldiers crouching behind shields , and @entity25 special forces with assault rifles fanning out in the grounds			1
above , @entity3 forces crash through the gates of the airbase on saturday soldiers in unmarked uniforms sit atop an armoured patrol vehicle at the gate of the @entity12 base as troops prepare to storm the compound members of @entity48 self - defence units take cover behind cars outside the military base while @entity3 forces take it over stun grenades were thrown at the few hundred remaining @entity9 support staff and pilots at the base			1
they were armed only with @entity58 rifles , pistols and homemade staves carved from branches			2
one man was injured , kicked and beaten on the ground as two more armoured personnel carriers surrounded the facility and scores more @entity3 soldiers poured in , all wearing balaclavas and body armour			1
a @entity9 soldier fell near me as a stun grenade exploded , then ran off to join his comrades			0
‘ look who are the real @entity76 now , ’ said one senior @entity9 officer			0
@entity3 officers screamed at the @entity9 troops to give up , with gunfire heard around the base			1
the unequal struggle carried on for 35 minutes , although the @entity9 were ordered not to return fire by their officers			0
there was no panic , however , merely anger and abuse towards the invading army , punctured by bursts of nervous joking			0
the @entity3 troops fanned out around the base			1
one armoured personnel carrier drove in close to the headquarters , its machine gun pointed at the @entity9 forces , while marksmen knelt beside it ready to attack : armed men crouch behind a van just before charging into the base , where a stand - off has been developing for weeks ‘ we will stay until the end , we will not give up , ’ said one @entity9			1
but the game was up after a stand - off that had lasted more than three weeks – to the growing frustration of the @entity3 forces who seized the arsenal and 35 aircraft at this strategically important base near @entity113 last month			1
its commander , a former fighter pilot named colonel @entity116 , had emerged as @entity9 ’s unlikely hero after marching his men into @entity3 fire aimed above their heads at the start of this strange conflict			1
yesterday , minutes after officiating at a wedding between two of his junior officers , with sniper units moving into position on the hills above us , he told me he was ignoring the latest one - hour ultimatum to hand over his base			1
‘ the @entity3 came here and told us to give up our weapons and leave			1
if we disagree , they will assault the base , ’ he said			1
three and a half hours later , they did exactly that			0
the warning came with gangs of @entity48 militia gathering outside the buildings , while armoured personnel carriers and jeeps with mounted machine guns moved into position nearby			2
arguments broke out at the gates between the militia and @entity9 soldiers			0
‘ you have your aim to protect the base , but we have our aim to put our flag up , ’ said one dressed in military clothing			2
stand - off : former fighter pilot @entity116 , left in peaked cap , emerged as an unlikely hero after a length stand - off with @entity3 forces smoke screen : a @entity9 serviceman at a separate base in @entity169 tires to ward off @entity3 forces with a smoke grenade minutes later – at 4.45pm – the unequal show of strength from @entity3 began as its heavily - armoured vehicles crashed through the 8ft high perimeter walls			1
there was confusion and shouting , then wailing from ambulances sirens and thumping of heavy machine gun fire			0
‘ this is the bitter truth , ’ colonel @entity31 said with an ironic smile			0
afterwards , he ordered his men to line up , just as they had a few hours earlier to celebrate their colleagues ’ wedding with champagne			0
‘ thank you for serving your commander			2
you can be proud of what you have achieved , ’ he said			0
there were cheers , and even a few tears , from these tough - looking troops			2
his men , with @entity3 rifles trained on them , movingly responded with a raucous rendition of the @entity9 national anthem and shouts of ‘ glory to @entity9 , glory to heroes ’			1
then they were ordered by the @entity3 to return to their rooms while @entity204 was arrested and taken from the base			1
captured : @entity9 's only submarine is seized at a base near @entity113 , @entity1 , in a separate event today @entity3 @entity210 sailors prepare the surrendered @entity9 submarine ' @entity212 ' so it can be towed it from the former @entity210 base to the @entity3 @entity215 base in @entity113 , @entity1 a sailor holds the @entity3 @entity218 flag on top of the submarine which was taken over military personnel board the vessel as a number of ships were taken over by @entity3 forces and handed over to the @entity215 many were worried about their families , with some wives and children still on the base			1
crowds of men waving the @entity3 flag gathered at the gates behind a fourth personnel carrier , with triumphant chants of ‘ @entity3 , @entity3 , @entity3 ’ breaking out			1
‘ this was not necessary , ’ said @entity237 , a @entity9 fighter pilot			0
‘ there have been no shots fired in @entity1 since @entity241 and now we have their special forces opening fire			1
this is very hard , everyone is worried			0
’ the previous day i had listened as colonel @entity31 rebuffed demands from a @entity3 colonel to surrender the base			1
‘ according to @entity255 laws this is part of the @entity3 , ’ declared the officer , wearing civilian clothes			1
‘ it is illegal for you to be here			0
’ ‘ no , this is the territory of @entity9 , ’ replied @entity204 , in trademark brown leather jacket and large peaked cap			0
‘ i will protect my soldiers and the wives of my soldiers			0
so long as no one comes on the base , there will be no conflict			2
’ the @entity3 officer insisted the @entity9 troops were acting illegally			2
‘ i want to be informed if you have given weapons to your staff , ’ he said			0
‘ our staff are guarding their territory , ’ responded colonel @entity31			0
‘ you are an officer			0
you should understand my position			0
every commander must chose his way , but i do n’t want to kill anyone			2
’ as they talked , local men who supported @entity3 annexation shouted homophobic remarks at the colonel			2
‘ people have become crazy , ’ said colonel @entity31 ’s wife @entity285 , 44 , who had stayed on the base			2
‘ i have had phone calls and texts saying lots of dirty and scary things			0
i ’m proud of him , but worried			0
’ the @entity9 troops knew an assault might be looming and felt abandoned by their bosses in @entity295			2
i saw two soldiers burning military documents on bonfires in the morning , while others carried personal possessions into cars			0
last night , @entity303 said by phone from the captured base : ‘ we are worried about our commander			2
we do n’t know where he is and nor does his wife			0
