this is the adorable moment a mother polar bear teaches her young cubs the art of diving			2
one by one , the cubs follow their mother 's lead and throw themselves into the water - although the lesson appears to get too much for one cub who decides he 'd rather get involved in a play fight - sneaking up behind his unwitting brother and pushing him into the pool			0
the pictures were taken by @entity18 photographer @entity17 , 63 , as she watched the young bears practicing their diving at @entity21			2
' this is a very happy family of polar bears learning to dive , ' the photographer said			0
' you see the mother teaching her cubs how it 's done , but they are just generally having fun together ... polar bears love swimming but they also like to play and jump into the water , so there was a lot of spray , ' she added			0
the polar bear is often regarded as a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea			0
in general they live relatively unsociable lives , but they are occasionally spotted playing in the wild - sometimes for hours at a time			0
' look at me , mummy ' : having watched their mother diving into the pool at @entity21 , the adorable polar bear cubs decide to follow her lead			1
one by one the young bears leap into the water - nervously at first , but increasingly confident the more they practice naughty : the diving lesson appears to get too much for one cub who decides he 'd rather get involved in a play fight - sneaking up behind his unwitting brother and pushing him into the pool practice makes perfect : the young polar bear cubs ( right ) spent time watching their mother ( left ) diving into the pool at @entity21			1
a short time later they were confident enough to give it a go themselves leap of faith : the pictures were taken by @entity18 photographer @entity17 , 63 , as she watched the young bears practicing their diving at @entity21 jump : polar bears are strong and hardy animals , but their habitat is threatened , so it is considered important to maintain a captive population			1
this year @entity21 is expecting a new generation of polar bears to be born , so visitors will have a chance to see diving bears long into the future incoming : photographer @entity17 said : ' a lot of people who see my photographs are surprised to see the unusual situation ... they love the joy of seeing these strong and healthy animals so happy , as they do n't expect them to be like this in a zoo ' shake it off : having enjoyed her time in the pool , the mother polar bear decides it 's time to dry off - shaking her huge head and sending water flying everywhere			1

adorable polar bear cubs watch their mother diving into the pool before deciding to give it a go themselves
diving lesson not *interesting* enough for one cub however , so he sneaks behind his brother and pushes him in
