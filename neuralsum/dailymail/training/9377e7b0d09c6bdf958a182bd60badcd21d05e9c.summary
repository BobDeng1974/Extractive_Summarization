a @entity1 woman has been receiving death threats after starting a crocodile conservation group			1
the woman , who wants to be known only by her nickname of ' @entity6 ' , started the @entity7 last week after reports the @entity10 government is considering a crocodile cull in response to a fatal crocodile attack earlier this month			1
within 24 hours of starting the group , the mother - of - one , who works in the crocodile industry , had received five death threats via @entity18			1
another guy told me if he saw me on the river he 'd capsize my boat , ' she told @entity35			0
@entity6 believes the threats came from ' fishermen with bees in their bonnets ' and said while they were unpleasant , she is unfazed by their comments			1
' it did n't scare me , it did n't deter me , all it did was p * * * me off and make me want to fight harder			0
' @entity44 , the father of @entity45 @entity45 , who gave his support to the newly - founded society , said he had received threats over the forty years he has been working in environmental conservation , but added that ' death threats or any threats of physical violence are totally out of order '			1
' the problem here in @entity57 is , we ’ve got very very few predatory animals and we do n’t seem to give them the just recognition they deserve , they are really important to the health of our environment			0
we have to look after our predatory animals the same as we do any fluffy furry koala , ' he told @entity35			0
' i ’m just really pleased we have a group of young @entity57 in the @entity10 who are prepared to get out there , ' he said			1
mr @entity45 added that the group was ' very brave ' and would ' cop a bit of flak ' because ' when it comes to crocodiles you do get people with very strong views indeed			1
' @entity44 , pictured with his son @entity45 , has come out in support of the conservation group saying they were ' brave ' for standing up to ' cowboys ' @entity6 started the conservation group after a famous crocodile ' @entity23 ' was shot and killed for fatally attacking a fisherman on the @entity86 @entity23 was a 4.5 - metre pied leucistic crocodile , which meant he had a distinctive white head but a pigmented body @entity6 was motivated to start the conservation group after a popular @entity10 crocodile , @entity23 , was shot and killed for attacking a local fisherman			1
@entity93 , 57 , was killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while fishing in the @entity86 on august 18			2
after the death , the 4.5 metre crocodile , who had a distinctive white head , was killed by authorities so mr @entity93 's remains could be recovered			1
@entity6 describes @entity23 , who was pied leucistic , meaning he had pigmentation on his body but an albino head , as ' very dear to my heart '			2
' i lived on the @entity86 and he used to sit outside my house			0
i used to watch him while i did the dishes , ' she said			0
' he was so genetically rare , he was one in a million , he was so amazing … generally [ leucistic crocodiles ] are attacked quite aggressively by other crocodiles and birds , so to get him out in the wild to the size he was , was a miracle			0
' @entity6 started a petition for @entity23 to be captured and have his stomach pumped , rather than be killed , and had even lined up a buyer in the @entity120 willing to pay several hundred thousand dollars for the crocodile , but her campaign was unsuccessful			1
the society started by @entity6 aims to give a voice to those who are concerned about crocodile culls and trophy - hunting and she is hoping they will be able to achieve non-profit status			1
' we 're not out there to say all the fishermen are bad			0
it 's about finding common ground and finding a solution that works for everyone			0
' ' @entity143 ' , featuring people posing in front of or on top of crocodile traps in the @entity10 have drawn strong criticism a man fishes from on top of a crocodile trap chief minister @entity148 said the death of mr @entity93 two weeks ago was ' a sign that the density and population of crocs in the @entity10 is becoming somewhat of an issue ' and that the cabinet would consider culling as a long - term policy as well as safari hunting			1
' it 's not about going out and randomly killing crocs , it 's about having a well - developed plan that protects the interests of the animal but also the interests of the general public , ' mr @entity148 said			2
@entity165 , senior research associate at @entity167 , says that while there are significantly more crocodiles in the @entity10 waters than there used to be , the crocodile population is merely returning to its natural levels			2
saltwater crocodiles were almost driven to extinction by hunting in the 1960s and it is estimated their population dropped to about 3,000			0
now , there are approximately 100,000 saltwater crocodiles in the @entity10 , the result of a management program that was put in place in 1971			2
mr @entity165 says the management program has been doing ' an excellent job ' of restoring the ecological balance that was threatened by the low numbers of crocodiles and said that since they have increased in number , crocodiles have become a significant economic asset for the @entity10 as well			2
@entity192 , a six - metre crocodile who is missing its front foreleg , is another famous crocodile in the @entity86 near @entity1 brutus the crocodile pictured last month eating a shark in the 1970s , the saltwater crocodile population dropped to 3,000 due to excessive hunting			1
a management program was implemented to restore their numbers , which involved protecting the species			0
now there are an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles in the @entity10			2
on average crocodiles kill one person every two years in @entity57			0
this year , four people have died in crocodile attacks in the @entity10			1
@entity93 , 57 , was killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while fishing in the @entity86 on august 18			2
the remains of 22 - year - old @entity215 were found inside a saltwater crocodile in @entity218 north of @entity1 earlier this month			1
in june a 62 - year - old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored in @entity222			2
in january a 12 - year - old @entity224 boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends at a billabong in @entity222			1
' some vocal people believe they should be curbed and the question has to be looked at very carefully ... i do n’t think it ’s going to achieve anything close to what people are hoping it will achieve , it will reverse the progress we ’ve seen with crocodiles over the last few decades			0
' it will affect a significant number of people without necessarily saving any lives , ' he told @entity35			0
mr @entity165 added that having a large cull of crocodiles in the state would be ' folly '			0
' if the @entity10 government said : " it 's open season on crocodiles and we 're going to remove 50,000 crocs from the wild " , there would be some fairly serious repercussions of the way people see @entity57			1
' mr @entity165 said that according to statistics one person is killed by crocodiles in the country every two years , but there has been a ' cluster ' of deaths in recent months			0
as well as the crocodile attack that claimed mr @entity93 , there have been three other deaths in the @entity10 from crocodile attacks so far this year			1
earlier in august the remains of 22 - year - old @entity215 were found inside a saltwater crocodile in @entity218 north of @entity1 ; a 62 - year - old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored in @entity222 in june and in january a 12 - year - old @entity224 boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends , also at @entity222			1
mr @entity165 said it was too early to tell if the deaths were a trend or a statistical ' blip ' and said it was more helpful to compare the number of crocodile fatalities in @entity57 with those in surrounding countries , where fatalities from crocodile attacks were much more common , despite smaller populations of the animals			0
mr @entity165 added that while he is not in favour of a large - scale cull of the animals , he does think it is necessary to kills crocodiles who attack humans			0
' i think it 's an unfortunate necessity in most situations if a crocodile has killed someone , that crocodile has learned that it can successfully attack and kill someone at that location , that makes it incredibly dangerous			2
i would rather see that crocodile killed and removed from the system , ' he said			0
he added that in the case of @entity23 it was ' unfortunate ' because he was a very popular animal , but that considering he lived right next to a busy boat ramp ' it would have been madness ' to let him live after he had successfully killed a human .			0
