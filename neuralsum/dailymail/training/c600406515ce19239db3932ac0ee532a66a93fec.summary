@entity0 deservedly beat local rivals @entity1 23 - 16 at @entity3 to go joint top of @entity5 of the @entity6			1
the win gives them eight points to join @entity10 on that figure and the two meetings between these sides in december is likely to decide the destiny of the pool			1
harlequins were the better side throughout and should have won more comfortably			2
they were far more creative in attack with their points coming from a try by the lively @entity23 and a penalty try award with @entity25 kicking three penalties and two conversions			1
@entity23 charges upfield for @entity0 and had a telling contribution against local rivals @entity1 @entity1 competed strongly but too many of their key players failed to have any influence on the game			1
powerful runners , @entity34 and @entity35 were largely anonymous with star wing , @entity37 , given no opportunity at all			0
@entity39 provided their only spark by scoring an excellent individual try which @entity42 converted to add to his three penalties			0
wasps were without their captain , @entity45 , who was still recovering from a virus			0
@entity47 was included on the flank with @entity49 recalled in place of @entity51			0
@entity0 originally made one change from last week 's win over @entity54 with @entity55 replacing @entity56 at tighthead but they were forced into another when their skipper , @entity58 , was a late withdrawal with a leg injury so @entity61 was called into the line - up			1
@entity63 took on the captaincy			0
@entity0 made a bad start when @entity66 fumbled the kick - off but they recovered to push the hosts off their own ball at the resulting scrum			2
the first 10 minutes were evenly contested before @entity25 took the first chance for points by kicking a penalty			2
@entity1 also had their opportunities but declined to take two kickable penalties in favour of more attacking options			0
their decision to do so proved fruitless as the home side carelessly lost a line - out and a scrum			0
when the third opportunity came , @entity1 went for the posts and @entity42 succeeded with a penalty but this was soon nullified by one from @entity25 to give @entity0 a 6 - 3 lead at the end of a disjointed first quarter			1
@entity89 is tackled by @entity90 in the @entity6 clash @entity0 were becoming the dominant force and almost scored the first try of the game			1
a neat pass from @entity96 sent @entity97 through a gap allowing the hooker to run 30 metres before being hauled down			0
@entity0 maintained the movement and appeared to have scored when @entity23 crossed the line but the @entity102 ruled that the lock had been held up			2
against the run of play , @entity1 took the lead with a solo try from @entity108			0
on the visitors 22 , @entity108 surprisingly robbed @entity110 of the ball to race away for the try which @entity42 converted			0
@entity0 quickly responded with an excellent try when skilful handling resulted in @entity89 sending in @entity23 for the try which @entity25 converted to give the visitors a deserved 13 - 10 interval lead			1
@entity1 fumbled the restart and soon conceded another penalty which @entity25 kicked to extend the advantage but @entity42 responded with two of his own , one an excellent effort from inside his own half			1
these penalties were the only scores of an error - ridden third quarter , which ended with the scores level at 16 - 16			0
@entity0 produced another flowing movement and looked set to score but @entity129 knocked on five metres out from the home line but from the scrum @entity1 , who had just lost their hooker , @entity133 through injury , were pushed off the ball			2
from the reset , @entity1 were unable to contain their opponents ' drive and conceded a penalty try which @entity25 converted			2
the outside half missed two penalties late on but it scarcely mattered as @entity0 remained in control until the final whistle .			1

@entity25 kicked three penalties and two conversions for @entity0
harlequins are now joint top of their @entity6 **group**
they meet @entity10 twice in december in **group** deciding matches
