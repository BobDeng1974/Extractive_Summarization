by @entity1 reporter published : 16:13 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 16:13 est , 3 january 2013 controversy surrounding a @entity5 newspaper 's decision to publish the names and addresses of local gun permit holders continued at fever pitch yesterday as a threatening envelope of white powder arrived in the newsroom 's mail			1
sparking initial fears of an anthrax attack , the surprise package came after @entity17 had reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper 's headquarters in @entity22			1
one employee who handled the envelope was checked for contamination before the intimidating missive was deemed to be harmless			2
scare : an envelope of white powder is a latest threat targeted at @entity5 paper @entity29 after it published a list of gun permit owners in the area ( stock photo ) while staffers continued their work yesterday evening , the threat was not taken lightly at the paper			1
@entity29 chief , @entity37 , told the @entity38 that ' the safety of my staff is my top priority			0
' the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity47 and @entity48 counties just north of @entity5 in an interactive map on its website			1
the @entity51 reported on tuesday that @entity17 editor @entity52 hired gun - toting security guards to patrol the paper 's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days			1
the paper hired the increased security from @entity61 , a firm based in @entity63 that provides services like protection and security guard certification , according to the @entity38			1
the news came just days after the @entity17 announced plans to publish an expanded list of even more permit - holding locals			1
targeted : the @entity17 published the names and addresses of people in the area with legal gun licenses on december 23rd along with an article entitled ' the gun owner next door : what you do n't know about the weapons in your neighborhood , ' the @entity17 map was compiled in response to the december 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in @entity88 , @entity89 , editors of the @entity92 - owned newspaper said			1
the next batch of names will be permit holders in suburban @entity96 , @entity5 , where the county clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information			1
some 44,000 people are licensed to own pistols in the three counties , the newspaper said			0
owners of rifles and shotguns do not need permits , the newspaper said			2
the publication prompted outrage , particularly on social media sites , among gun owners			2
' do you fools realize that you also made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns in them to protect themselves ? ' @entity118 of @entity119 , @entity120 , posted on the newspaper 's web site			0
' what a bunch of liberal boobs you all are			0
' @entity126 state senator @entity125 of @entity127 , @entity5 , said he planned to introduce legislation to keep permit information private except to prosecutors and police			2
naming names : the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity47 and @entity48 counties just north of @entity5 in an interactive map on its website a similar bill that he introduced earlier as an assemblyman failed in the @entity142			1
' the asinine editors at the @entity17 have once again gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet letter on law abiding firearm owners throughout the region , ' @entity125 wrote on his @entity150 web site			1
the newspaper 's editor and vice president of news , @entity153 , earlier in the week defended the decision to list the permit holders			0
' we knew publication of the database would be controversial , but we felt sharing as much information as we could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity88 shootings , ' she said			2
some critics retaliated by posting reporters ' and editors ' addresses and other personal information online			0
@entity170 , a journalism professor at the @entity171 at @entity172 , called the critics ' response childish and petulant			0
calling for change : the paper said that they decided to do so because in the wake of the @entity88 shooting , many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood , and across the country there were protests ( pictured ) ' it does n't move the issue of gun control to the level of intelligent public discussion , ' he said			1
' instead , it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting			0
' @entity170 said the information about permit holders was public and , if presented in context , served a legitimate interest			0
but media critic @entity201 of the @entity203 - based @entity202 wrote online this week that the newspaper 's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit holders ' loss of privacy			0
' if journalists could show flaws in the gun permitting system , that would be newsworthy , ' he said			0
' or , for example , if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political connections , then journalists could better justify the privacy invasion			2
' @entity201 said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears			0
' the net effect of the abuse of public records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening records , which would be the biggest mistake of all , ' he said .			0

the @entity17 published names and addresses of gun permit owners on december 23
the controversial move has sparked a huge *backlash* prompting the paper to hire armed guards for security
