by @entity0 big break : @entity2 with @entity3 in the heart - warming 1994 movie @entity2 became an overnight star when he was cast as the hapless @entity7 in the smash - hit movie @entity9			1
but the actor almost lost out on the role of a lifetime because the producers of the film , which celebrates its 20th anniversary next month , thought he was too good - looking – and he wanted an extra £ 5,000 for the part			1
in an interview on today ’s reunion programme on @entity19 , @entity20 – who wrote the screenplay – reveals that he tried to block the casting of @entity2 because he did n’t think anyone would believe he could be unlucky in love			1
he said : ‘ i was worried about it			0
when @entity2 did first come in , i did think he was too handsome			2
i thought people would not believe the fact he was in trouble with girls because he so clearly would n’t be			0
so that ’s why he pushed the sort of doubtfulness and lack of confidence			0
‘ he was by far the best person who auditioned but i still voted against him when it came down to the vote between two people			0
’ @entity2 , who had previously starred in the @entity40 film @entity41 , was a relatively unknown 33 - year - old when @entity20 was over-ruled and he was cast for a fee of £ 35,000			1
but the film ’s producer @entity44 recalls how @entity2 , who appeared opposite @entity46 actress @entity3 , almost lost the role when his agent asked for an additional £ 5,000			1
he said : ‘ we could n’t afford much at all			0
so the “ friends ” got £ 17,500 each and @entity2 got £ 35,000			1
i remember @entity53 , @entity2 ’s agent , saying , “ ok , we understand			2
£ 40,000 and he is yours			2
” i said , “ sorry , you just do n’t understand			0
it ’s £ 35,000 and if you do n’t accept that then obviously we lose him			2
” ’ @entity20 , @entity58 and the film ’s director @entity59 also recall how they had to come up with ingenious cost - cutting measures so that they could produce four weddings on a budget of £ 3million			1

@entity82 , now an mp , knew a lot of dukes and earls who would appear for nothing , or for an extra ’s pay			0
‘ i swear that you can look across the room and pick out the real aristocrats			0
so they gave us the authenticity			0
they all owned their own morning suits , so we saved on the @entity97 aspect of the budget			0
’ writer and director @entity20 , 57 – who went on to make the films @entity100 and @entity102 , also starring @entity2 – says he wrote the film partly to explain to his own mother why he had never married but hints that he might be about to propose to his real long - term partner , @entity105			1
