by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 04:32 est , 10 january 2013 an excavation team searching for a stash of legendary @entity5 - era @entity4 fighter aircraft in northern @entity6 said today it had found a wooden crate believed to contain one of the planes , but it was full of muddy water			1
it was not immediately clear how much damage the water may have caused , and searchers could not definitively say what was inside the crate			1
but @entity4 aviation enthusiast @entity17 , who is driving the hunt for the rare @entity20 planes , called the results ' very encouraging			1
' research materials of the buried @entity4 spitfires are displayed on a board during a press conference in @entity6 , @entity6 , where a @entity4 excavation team have found a crate they believe contains one of the planes the wooden crate was located in northern @entity6 was found in @entity31 in @entity32 during a dig that began last month ' it will take some time to pump the water out ... but i do expect all aircraft to be in very good condition , ' @entity17 told reporters in @entity6 's main city , @entity41			1
the single - seater @entity42 , which helped @entity4 beat back waves of @entity46 bombers during the war more than six decades ago , remains the most famous @entity4 combat aircraft			2
@entity4 built a total of about 20,000 spitfires , although the dawn of the jet age meant the propeller - driven planes quickly became obsolete			2
as many as @entity50 - three to four times the number of airworthy models known to exist - are believed to have been buried in near - pristine condition in @entity6 by @entity59 engineers as the war drew to a close			1
project leader @entity17 ( second right ) speaks at a press conference today as his excavation team revealed they had found a crate in the @entity66 jungle which they believe may contain one of the lost @entity5 spitfires @entity72 ( right ) , a 91 - year - old former @entity4 soldier who is one of eight people who said they have seen buried @entity4 spitfires in @entity6 , speaks at a press conference as project leader mr @entity17 ( left ) looks on a man takes photos of the research materials of a buried @entity20 during the press conference at a hotel in @entity41 a journalist takes photos of research materials related to buried @entity4 spitfires which are thought to be buried in the @entity6 jungle the wooden crate located in northern @entity6 was found in @entity31 in @entity32 during a dig that began last month			1
it is one of several digs planned nationwide , including another near the airport in @entity41			0
@entity17 said the search team in @entity32 inserted a camera into the crate and found it was full of water			1
it was unclear what was inside the crate , he said , but the water will be pumped out during an operation that could take weeks , he said			1
the go - ahead for excavation came in october when @entity6 's government signed an agreement with @entity17 and his local partner			1
hopeful : @entity17 , pictured in front of a spitfire at the @entity105 in @entity106 , hopes the planes will still be in ' first - class condition ' one of the @entity50 ( pictured : the tail fins ) being crated up in @entity6 in 1945 ready to be buried avengers re-assemble : the team hopes to be able to uncover the @entity113 in a good enough state so that they can be reassembled upon their return to @entity4 ( file photo ) under the deal , @entity6 's government will get one plane for display at a museum , as well as half of the remaining total			2
@entity123 , a private company headed by @entity17 , will get 30 percent of the total and the @entity6 partner company @entity126 , headed by @entity127 , will get 20 percent			2
during the project 's first phase , searchers hope to recover 60 planes : 36 planes in @entity132 , near @entity41 's international airport ; six in @entity134 in central @entity6 ; and 18 in @entity31			1
others are to be recovered in a second phase			0
searchers hope the aircraft are in pristine condition , but others have said it 's possible all they might find is a mass of corroded metal and rusty aircraft parts			0
@entity17 said the practice of burying aircraft , tanks and jeeps was common after the war			0
' basically nobody had got any orders to take these airplanes back to ( the ) @entity4			0
they were just surplus ... ( and ) one way of disposing them was to bury them , ' @entity17 said			0
' the war was over , everybody wanted to go home , nobody wanted anything , so you just buried it and went home			0
' @entity167 , a 91 - year - old war veteran from @entity4 who says he witnessed the aircraft 's burial , traveled to @entity6 to observe the search			2
it is ' very exciting for me because i never thought i would be allowed to come back and see where spitfires have been buried , ' @entity167 said			0
' it 's been a long time since anybody believed what i said until @entity17 came along			0
' a place in history : a poster unveiling the @entity20 from around 1939			0
