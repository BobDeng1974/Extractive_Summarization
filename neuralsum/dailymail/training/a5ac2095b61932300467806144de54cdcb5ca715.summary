by @entity0 created 3:44 pm on 22nd september 2011 @entity2 dr @entity1 outside the @entity3 hearing in @entity4 a doctor accused of ‘ inappropriately ’ discussing his devout @entity2 faith during a consultation with a patient yesterday launched a legal battle to avoid being @entity10 @entity1 , 51 , appeared before a disciplinary hearing after allegedly talking to the patient about @entity13 in a way the @entity3 described as ‘ insensitive , exploitative and inappropriate ’			1
the @entity3 heard dr @entity1 had ‘ crossed the line ’ by allegedly suggesting the ‘ suicidal and vulnerable ’ patient could be helped by @entity18 rather than his own faith			1
the married gp is one of six @entity2 partners at a medical centre which states on its website that spiritual matters are likely to be discussed with patients during consultations			1
but yesterday dr @entity1 , who was educated at @entity28 , began a fight to clear his name after the mother of one of his patients complained he had tried to foist his faith on her son			1
dr @entity1 refused to accept a formal warning , instead choosing to go to a full hearing			2
he claims he acted professionally and within the @entity3 guidelines			2
the incident allegedly happened in august 2010 , when the 24 - year - old patient visited him at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			2
dr @entity1 , who used to be a medical missionary in @entity46 and @entity47 , says he gave the patient a full medical consultation , but felt he needed help to get out of a rut			0
so at the end of the appointment , he began talking about his own @entity2 belief , saying it could give him ‘ comfort and strength ’			1
but afterwards , the 24 - year - old told his mother ‘ he just said i need @entity13 ’ , prompting her to file a complaint			1
@entity62 , counsel for the @entity3 , said : ‘ a line was crossed because dr @entity1 expressed his personal religious belief to a person who he knew was a vulnerable patient in a way that was plainly liable to cause the patient distress			1
the patient , who was seen by the @entity2 at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , pictured , felt dr @entity1 had ' belittled ' his own faith , the @entity3 heard ‘ he suggested @entity13 or @entity18 – his own religion – offered something exclusive and superior to that offered by the patient ’s own religion			1
’ the professional body placed an official warning on dr @entity1 ’s file as a ‘ compromise ’			0
but the @entity2 , a doctor for 28 years , is calling on the @entity3 to strike out the complaint because it was made by the patient ’s mother			1
dr @entity1 claims she is not qualified to comment on what treatment a medical practitioner should prescribe her son			0
yesterday the hearing was told that the unnamed patient had been asked to attend the medical tribunal to testify against the gp , but he had not turned up because he was suffering from anxiety			1
lawyers are now arguing whether the panel can accept his written statement			0
mr @entity62 says it would be ‘ unfair ’ to call the witness when he is ‘ ill ’ , but dr @entity1 ’s lawyer said he can not defend himself properly if the man does not attend			0
in an interview last may dr @entity1 , a lay preacher , said : ‘ i only discussed mutual faith after obtaining the patient ’s permission			2
‘ in our conversation , i said that personally , i had found having faith in @entity13 helped me and could help the patient			2
at no time did the patient indicate that they were offended , or that they wanted to stop the discussion			0
if that had been the case , i would have immediately ended the conversation			0
’ dr @entity1 , whose wife @entity112 , 50 , is also a doctor , said : ‘ by appealing against the decision , it will go to a public hearing			0
but it is worth the risk as i wanted to do this because there is a bigger picture			0
‘ i wanted to give confidence and inspiration to other @entity123 who work in the medical profession			0
’ the case continues .			0

@entity2 is alleged to have told him faith in @entity18 may help him *overcome* personal *problems*
