it has baffled boffins with its metal rich core			0
now , researchers say they have solved the mystery of how @entity5 became the ' iron planet ' - with its massive core making up 65 % of its mass. they key was a giant interplanetary ' hit and run ' with either @entity12 or @entity13			1
new simulations show that @entity5 and other unusually metal - rich objects in the solar system may be relics left behind by hit - and - run collisions in the early solar system with @entity12 or @entity13			1
@entity5 is the smallest and closest to the @entity20 of the eight planets in the @entity22 , with an orbital period of about 88 @entity12 days			2
unlike @entity12 , which as several plates of crust , @entity5 has just one rigid , rocky layer which bears telltale cliffs and chasms caused by global contraction			2
the small , innermost planet has more than twice the fraction of metallic iron of any other terrestrial planet			1
its iron core makes up about 65 percent of @entity5 ’s total mass ; @entity12 ’s core , by comparison , is just 32 percent of its mass. according to a study published online in @entity41 july 6 , @entity5 and other unusually metal - rich objects in the solar system may be relics left behind by collisions in the early solar system that built the other planets			1
@entity5 , the small , innermost planet has more than twice the fraction of metallic iron of any other terrestrial planet			1
its iron core makes up about 65 percent of @entity5 ’s total mass ; @entity12 ’s core , by comparison , is just 32 percent of its mass. @entity53 professor @entity52 said @entity5 may have lost half its mantle in a grazing blow into a larger planet ( proto - @entity13 or proto - @entity12 )			1
one or more hit - and - run collisions could have potentially stripped away proto - @entity5 ’s mantle without an intense shock , thy say , leaving behind a mostly - iron body			2
the bright crater just south of the center of the image is @entity65 , identified on images from the @entity68 mission in the 1970s			0
@entity69 and @entity70 of the @entity71 developed a statistical scenario for how planets merge and grow based on the common notion that @entity75 and @entity5 are the last two relics of an original population of maybe 20 bodies that mostly accreted to form @entity13 and @entity12			1
these last two planets lucked out			0
' how did they luck out ? @entity75 , by missing out on most of the action – not colliding into any larger body since its formation – and @entity5 , by hitting the larger planets in a glancing blow each time , failing to accrete , ' explains @entity69			2
the main bodies of the solar system , the @entity20 , @entity5 , @entity13 , the @entity12 , from left in foreground , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity75 , from left in background			1
the @entity95 , the @entity12 's natural satellite , is seen at right in foreground , as the relative size of the orbits of the planets is not respected			0
' it ’s like landing heads two or three times in a row – lucky , but not crazy lucky			0
' in fact , about one in 10 lucky			0
' ' the surprising result we have shown is that hit - and - run relics not only can exist in rare cases , but that survivors of repeated hit - and - run incidents can dominate the surviving population			0
' that is , the average unaccreted body will have been subject to more than one hit - and - run collision , ' explains @entity69			0
' we propose one or two of these hit - and - run collisions can explain @entity5 ’s massive metallic core and very thin rocky mantle			2
' according to @entity70 , who performed the computer modeling for the study , ' @entity121 collisions put the final touches on our planets			0
' only recently have we started to understand how profound and deep those final touches can be			0
' the implication of the dynamical scenario explains , at long last , where the ‘ missing mantle ’ of @entity5 is – it ’s on @entity13 or the @entity12 , the hit - and - run targets that won the sweep - up			1

@entity5 , the small , innermost planet has more than twice the fraction of metallic iron of any other terrestrial planet
