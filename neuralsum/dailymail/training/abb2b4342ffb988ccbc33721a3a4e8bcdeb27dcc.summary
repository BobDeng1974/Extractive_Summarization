house speaker @entity0 has n't been coy about his interest in tackling immigration reform legislation			1
just last week the @entity4 leader said he was ' hell bent ' on doing so before the 113th @entity6 adjourns at the end of this year , despite facing pressure from members of his caucus not to bring the issue to the @entity13 floor			0
the speaker 's zeal for getting his @entity4 colleagues to embrace immigration reform took a sharp turn on thursday from determination to antagonism , however , when @entity0 publicly made fun of his @entity4 colleagues for being too afraid to confront the issue publicly			1
' here 's the attitude			0
do n't make me do this			2
this is too hard , ' @entity0 said , doing an impression of his congressional caucus while squealing like a child			2
' here 's the attitude			0
do n't make me do this			2
this is too hard , ' house speaker @entity0 said on thursday , squealing like a child while making fun of his @entity4 colleagues ' position on immigration reform ' we get elected to make choices			1
we get elected to solve problems and it 's remarkable to me how many of my colleagues just do n't want to ... they 'll take the path of least resistance , ' @entity0 continued			1
' i 've had every brick and bat and arrow shot at me over this issue just because i wanted to deal with it			0
i did n't say it was going to be easy			0
' during thursday 's event , @entity0 also took shot 's at national @entity63 groups ' whom purport to represent the @entity63			1
' ' i made it pretty clear i 'll stand with the @entity63 , but i 'm not standing with these three or four groups in @entity67 who are using the @entity63 for their own personal benefit , ' @entity0 said			1
according to the @entity71 , which first reported the story , @entity0 's remarks on thursday took place at a luncheon in the @entity76 's @entity75 at the @entity77			1
@entity0 's office tried to frame the @entity80 's immigration comments on friday as playful			2
spokesman @entity81 told @entity82 , ' as the speaker often says to his colleagues , you only tease the ones you love			2
' @entity0 has n't been coy about his interest in tackling immigration reform			1
last he said he was " hell bent " on doing so before the 113th @entity6 adjourns at the end of this year this is the second time in the last seven days that @entity0 's nabbed headlines for coming off as a little too eager to pass immigration reform			1
after @entity0 's ' hell bent ' comment at a @entity95 , @entity97 gathering of @entity4 donors last thursday , @entity81 told reporters that ' nothing has changed ' and immigration reform was n't on the table at this time			1
' everyone can tell their editors to chill			0
the @entity13 â€™s focus remains on jobs and the economy , ' @entity81 said in an email to reporters , followed by an on - the - record statement that , ' nothing has changed			0
' ' as he 's said many times , the speaker believes step - by - step reform is important , but it wo n't happen until the president builds trust and demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law , ' @entity81 's statement read			2
@entity0 quickly tried to shift gears and get back on message on friday after his immigration comments made national news			1
the speaker announced mid-morning via a video posted to his @entity127 page that he would be giving this week 's @entity4 address on behalf of the party			0
' we 'll be talking about jobs , healthcare and much more , ' @entity0 says in the video			0
@entity0 's @entity127 audience had most certainly heard about his immigration remarks			2
within an hour , the video already had more than 150 unique comments , many of which referenced immigration reform			0
' please include in your speech exactly how rewarding criminals with amnesty will help jobs in @entity76 , ' @entity127 user @entity141 commented below the video			0
' no amnesty , ' said several others			0
while some of the immigration comments on the video were pro-reform , the bulk were not			0
' if the @entity4 sell us out on amnesty , it is game over for liberty in @entity160 , @entity154 , founder of @entity154 said in a fundraising email on friday			0
@entity0 's congressional seat is up for re-election this fall , and three republicans are challenging the speaker of the house in the party 's may 6 primary			1
opponent @entity168 , a high school @entity171 teacher who thinks @entity0 has ' electile dysfunction ' and has the backing of national @entity63 organization @entity175 , asked if @entity0 was , ' auditioning for an @entity177 gig ? ' in a tweet accompanying a link to the @entity71 's story .			1
