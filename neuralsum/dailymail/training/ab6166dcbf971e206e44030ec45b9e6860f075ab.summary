sir @entity98 said : ' is my @entity110 friend aware of the serial bad behaviour by the co-op in my constituency and others in the south , where it is taking over pubs and converting them into shops , often on very unsatisfactory sites ? ' @entity96 in @entity16 in my constituency is uniquely badly placed to serve as a @entity6 op. the village 's campaign to save @entity96 has received the backing of their local mp , sir @entity98 ' will he look at what he can do to review the article 4 direction scheme , and to give general instructions about where such shops should be sited ?
