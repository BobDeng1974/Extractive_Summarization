by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is preparing for saturday 's meeting with @entity4 with the same respect he had for @entity6 last weekend - insisting he has no ' big club ' hang - ups			1
the @entity9 lost his first competitive match in charge of @entity12 when they slipped to a narrow 2 - 1 defeat at @entity15 on sunday and will be hoping to pick up a win in his maiden home game against the @entity4			1
between now and a november 30 meeting with reigning @entity20 champions @entity19 , only a visit to face @entity22 and former boss @entity23 at @entity24 sees @entity12 face a team who finished above them last season			1
orders : @entity2 , manager of @entity12 , gives instructions to his team at @entity15 new saint : @entity31 was one of eight new signings to make their debut at @entity15 games against newly - promoted @entity36 and @entity37 also fall during that period , with @entity4 the start of a healthy - looking run of fixtures for @entity2 's side - but the former @entity44 coach refuses to take anything for granted			1
' i think it is not good to speak about the big clubs , ' he said			0
' if you look back to the results in the first matches , all of them are very close			0
@entity54 only won in the last minute ( against @entity55 )			0
' what is a big team ? the competition is very competitive and you have to play good and you have to be good to win against everybody			0
' sometimes the name of the club means a lot but , between the lines , it can be difficult against everybody and you have to prepare yourself to play well against everybody			0
' many have tipped @entity12 to struggle to replicate last season 's best - ever eighth place finish given the sales of several key players			1
@entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 all moved to @entity6 whilst @entity77 signed for @entity78 and @entity54 came in for @entity79			2
good start : @entity81 impressed on debut for @entity12 , laying on a goal for @entity84 with a lovely touch but @entity2 has re-invested much of that money and his new - look side were unfortunate to lose at @entity6 , with @entity88 scoring a 79th - minute winner for the hosts			1
having come close to taking a point from last season 's runners - up , @entity2 believes his players will be able to draw on that experience			1
' it was frustrating , ' he said about the defeat			2
' i thought we played at a good level with an amazing second half and the result was not what we deserved			0
' it was good for the confidence because maybe everyone was afraid about how we would start the season			0
we showed our qualities and showed we are a team who can be very competitive against everybody			0
' we know this saturday it will be different , maybe more difficult because everyone expects the same level at home and we have to dominate more than we did against @entity6			1
the belief is in the team and in the players and everyone is ready for saturday			2
' prolific : @entity119 made more successful tackles in the first half than the whole @entity6 team			2

@entity12 impressed during their opening day defeat to @entity6
@entity2 's side face @entity4 at @entity127 's on saturday
the former @entity44 coach says he will not take anything for granted
