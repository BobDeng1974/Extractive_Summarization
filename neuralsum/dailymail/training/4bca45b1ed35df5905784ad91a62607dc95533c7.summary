by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 05:53 est , 30 august 2013 a cannibal cult leader calling himself @entity3 , who slaughtered his ' @entity5 ' followers and drank their blood , has himself been murdered in the jungles of @entity8			1
in flowing robes , @entity9 , 40 , a failed @entity10 student , once led 6,000 ' disciples ' through the mountainous regions of the country , but was accused of killing at least three young girls and , as their mothers were forced to watch , drinking their blood			1
calling himself ' the true @entity18 ' , he was convicted of only rape three years ago - before the country brought in new laws that meant convicted killers and rapists could receive the death penalty - and was among 48 prisoners who broke out of jail six months ago			2
' black jesus ' : notorious cult leader @entity9 after he was captured in @entity8 in 2007 since then he has been on the run with a handful of faithful followers , but his bizarre life came to an end when he was said to have murdered a village woman this week and attempted to take the life of another			1
surrounded by furious villagers on thursday , he is believed to have been beaten and hacked to death , along with one of his henchmen in the remote village of @entity42 in the northern province of @entity44			2
a special investigation by the @entity46 six years ago heard from three women who said they had witnessed @entity9 drinking their murdered daughters ' blood in bizarre sacrificial ceremonies in village huts as he led his followers through the jungle			1
because of the remote area where he was murdered , police have not been able to establish whether he allegedly murdered a woman because he had started up his former cult and needed more human sacrifices			0
@entity44 provincial police commander chief superintendent @entity59 told the @entity61 newspaper that the village where @entity9 met his death is several miles by foot along jungle tracks from the nearest small town			1
capture : the feared @entity9 was beaten by villagers and tied up before being handed over to the police in 2007 ' we are sending police and a doctor to the village to ascertain the cause of death			1
' the village where he was based is a four hour walk and from advice and given reports of the state of his body , he will have to be buried soon after the post-mortem is conducted , ' said superintendent @entity59			0
followers : @entity9 gathered more than six thousand disciples with his preaching in the jungles ( library image ) the police officer warned that other prisoners who remain on the run and who might be associated with @entity9 should give themselves up			1
' he is now dead and this could be the fate of the others who are also on the run from the authorities			0
i am warning and strongly urging those escapees to surrender themselves to authorities			0
' at the height of his infamy , @entity3 wore long white robes as he stood on a rock in a jungle clearing and preached his own kind of gospel to his disciples			1
he told the crowds that they would receive gifts from heaven if they followed him			0
but behind his preachings was evil intent			0
luring young females he called his @entity5 into huts , he cut their throats and consumed their blood , mothers testified later			2
one woman said she was ordered to drink her own daughter 's blood on one occasion			2
police were unable to capture him , despite knowing where he was because of the constant the presence of his large ' flock ' - he was guarded by henchmen who carried rifles , spears and bows and arrows			0
but villagers finally carried out a ' citizens ' arrest ' in 2007 and @entity9 was eventually jailed			2
now , it is village power once again that has brought an end to his warped teachings			0
it is expected he will be buried near the small jungle community where he was killed .			0
