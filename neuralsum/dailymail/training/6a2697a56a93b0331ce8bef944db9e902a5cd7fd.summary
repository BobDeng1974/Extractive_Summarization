how do you make a newborn baby even more adorable ? dress him / her as an angel , cupid or a superbaby of course			2
photographer @entity8 has created a stunning range of portraits of infants in elaborate fancy dress			1
the 34 - year - old places her tiny subjects in the middle of fantastical scenes depicting @entity18 deserts , starry skies and sparkling seas			1
olé : @entity8 captures images of newborns positioned in colourful scenes @entity8 originally came to live in @entity25 after moving from @entity26 in 1998 when she took up photography			1
each of the photographs require the babies to lie incredibly still in order for them to blend into their backgrounds			2
to avoid any unwanted wriggling @entity8 photographs the tots when they are three to ten days old which is the time when they tend to sleep the most and therefore move the least			1
it also means that their limbs can be easily be positioned in the complicated poses while maintaining the comfort of the sleeping baby			0
when @entity8 originally started taking her photographs she says the scale was a lot smaller with less ambitious props			2
bobbing along : @entity8 takes her pictures when the babies are between 3 - 10 days old when they are at their most sleepy @entity52 : by photographing them at such a young age @entity8 is able to pose the baby 's limbs more easily creative crab : it was after having her own children that @entity8 decided to get more inventive with her photographs ' i commissioned a lady who does professional knitting to knit a lot of baby hats , blankets and i also bought various other accessories , so now i have a whole collection for newborn and baby photography shoots			1
' @entity8 , who describes herself as a mumtrepreneaur and is a mother herself meaning that she is incredibly engaged in her work ' babies are so unbelievably cute especially in those first days after being born ' says @entity8			1
she says it was when she finally had her own children that she began attempted far more inventive photographs			0
' when i became a mother myself three years ago , i could feel my creative desires changing , urging me to use my new skills as a parent to create wonderful images that other new parents would treasure forever			0
hanging around : despite the serene appearance of her images @entity8 says that babies can be very uncooperative little angel : many of @entity8 's photographs picture babies who have nodded off to sleep @entity97 baby ! @entity8 first began photographing babies when she moved to @entity25 in 1998 ' there is something magical about capturing an image , a small piece of reality , and turning it into an artifact of that moment in time			1
' despite the serene look of the images the photographer says that creating the images is n't always a peaceful process			0
' in order to make the photo good enough to honour that moment in time , some knowledge and practice is needed , and a lot of patience			0
' the more you learn , the more you practice , the more natural it becomes			0
there 's always something more to learn			0
sweet dreams : the sets for the images are created using fabrics and often a fleece background little cherub : @entity8 combines her experience as a photographer with her experience as a mother to create the perfect photograph flying high : @entity8 says that her photographs are a great way of capturing a baby 's first days on the earth ' kids never do what you want them to do – ask them to stand still and smile nicely and you 'll invariably get scowls , creepy grins , and silly faces			1
' i quickly discovered the best way to really capture your child is to photograph them in action			0
' @entity8 is not unaware of the fact that many people are capable of photographing their own babies however , she says that the service she provides is far more sentimental			2
' many people have access to specialist cameras and photography equipment nowadays , but my shoots are as much about the experience as the end product			0
out of this world : in this inventive image @entity8 has used a paper plate to recreate a space helmet having a whale of a time : when she first started out @entity8 's photographs were far more humble with babies posing in knitted hats they have since got far more elaborate ' for many parents the shoots are the first time they 've shown off their newborn to the world , and they want to capture such a special moment with a professional photo , captured by someone with a trained eye and plenty of experience			1
' @entity8 says that it is her combination of personal experience and professionalism makes her photos so special			2
' luckily , my lifetime spent as a photographer and my role as a loving mother puts me in a unique position to offer an unforgettable experience for parents – with a beautiful collection of photos they can take away			0
' out and about : @entity8 says that the babies are completely comfortable in her photographs festive fun : one baby poses as part of @entity208 's washing line in this @entity210 - themed shoot doting mother : @entity8 is pictured here with her son @entity213			1
