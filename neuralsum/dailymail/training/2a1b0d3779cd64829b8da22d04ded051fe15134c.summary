@entity0 , the widow of @entity2 bomb suspect , @entity1 , was ' an all - american girl who was brainwashed ' by her extremist husband according to one schoolfriend			1
today @entity5 has gained the first glimpse and pictures of the early life of the woman who , according to those who knew her best , was ' totally transformed ' by @entity1			1
at high school her personal motto was ' do something about it or stop complaining '			1
she dreamed of going to college and joining the @entity16			1
she urged her friends to ' lighten up and enjoy the small things , ' in life			2
by the time she was 21 she had married him and borne his child , @entity34 , now three			2
she had converted to @entity35 , hidden her tumble of chestnut hair beneath the hijab and undergone a change so profound that today few friends profess to truly understand it			2
yesterday @entity0 , who has been staying at her parents ’ home in @entity44 , returned to the @entity26 , @entity45 home which she shared with her late husband			1
dressed in a leopard print hijab she darted into the white shingle house to collect some belongings and her pet cat while her daughter waited in the car			2
today she was back home , accompanied by armed federal agents who first interviewed @entity0 and her family on friday			1
what did she know ? @entity0 's proximity to both brothers makes her a key witness - witting or otherwise			1
a team of federal agents today delivered a package to her home after her mother reluctantly answered the door great future : her friends say she dreamed of going to the @entity16 - before she met @entity1 shortly before 6pm on sunday three law enforcement agents – two men , one woman - all wearing dark sunglasses delivered a package to the @entity72 's family home			1
@entity0 's mother @entity74 was initially reluctant to answer the front door , opening it fully only after requesting that the officers , thought to be federal agents , showed their credentials			1
at around 7.30 the federal agents returned to the @entity71 home as there was a marked increase in law enforcement activity in this quiet suburban neighborhood			2
@entity5 has learned that the family 's attorney entered by a back door as several officers were seen going into the family home			1
the agents stayed for just over an hour			2
moments after they left , the family 's attorney @entity92 did likewise			2
mr @entity92 said he could not discuss any detail of what had passed between his client and the agents , saying only that there were ‘ talks			2
’ he said ‘ we ’re doing our best to deal with a very difficult situation			2
the family ’s going through a lot			2
that ’s the best i can do at the moment			2
’ through the years : she had a comfortable upbringing as the eldest daughter of a doctor and a nurse involved : @entity72 , circled , is pictured with her high school dance team , third from right on the back row their presence raises the question how much did @entity0 know about her late husband 's activities and links ? @entity0 's awareness of her then husband 's movements , thoughts and plans is under intense scrutiny as her relation to @entity127 and her proximity to both brothers makes her a key witness - witting or otherwise			1
after all she was living with @entity1 when he travelled to @entity131 in 2011 – a trip now attracting the interest of investigators trying to establish whether he met with @entity136 at that time			1
@entity136 was a @entity137 jihadist who died in 2012 after a vicious stand - off with @entity140 security services			1
as it has already been revealed , @entity1 was on the @entity143 's radar during that time as they were asked to look into his potential links to extremist groups			1
none who knew her as a child could have dreamed that this would be the face she would one day present to the world , nor that her life and those of so many @entity157 would be so violently caught up with two brothers from @entity29 and a cause as unclear as it was brutal			2
out : she exits a car with her father @entity72 , left , as they arrive at the family home in @entity44 changed : her school friends have described how she transformed after meeting @entity1 in hiding : the @entity71 home in @entity168 , @entity44 , where @entity0 is staying support : a man , believed to be @entity72 , father of @entity0 , smiles at the media family : after pulling into her driveway , @entity174 , @entity0 's mother , spoke briefly with the media as a girl growing up in @entity44 @entity0 was known to her friends as @entity0			1
one school friend who asked not to be named recalled : ‘ i saw her like a few months ago and she was just totally transformed			1
she was not the same person at all			0
’ another agreed : ‘ she was just this @entity176 who was brainwashed by her super-religious husband			0
nobody understands what happened to her			0
‘ none of us would have dreamed that she would marry so young or drop out of college and have a baby or convert or be part of any of what ’s happened			0
’ she said , ‘ she ’s just not the same person at all			0
’ it would be hard to imagine a childhood more rooted in @entity21 ’s pilgrim heritage than @entity0 ’s			1
it is in there in the names of the towns – @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 – where many of her friends still live and writ large in the wholesome values of the one - time @entity203 ’s home life			1
the eldest of three daughters , to emergency physician dr @entity72 and nurse @entity74 , hers is a background steeped in the values of family and education			0
she attended @entity209 , @entity168			0
as a sixth grader she is pictured smiling from the pages of the 2001 - 2002 yearbook dedicated to the @entity213 in the wake of 9/11			1
– a date , the opening dedication reads , ‘ forever in our minds			0
’ a section of the book is titled , ‘ @entity227 , ’ as the school , along with the rest of the nation , refused to be cowed by the acts of terror that hit the homeland that day			0
' attackers ' : her husband @entity1 and his younger brother @entity230 were allegedly behind the bombings at the @entity232 last monday , which left three dead and more than 180 injured @entity233 , aunt of the suspected bombers , shared this photo of a young @entity230 ( c , bottom ) and @entity1 ( c , top ) with their sisters about 15 years ago chilling : @entity1 and @entity230 are seen near the marathon finish line before the bombings scene : @entity230 was found in a boat in @entity243 , @entity45 on friday following a massive manhunt in 2004 @entity0 progressed to @entity245			1
she took part gamely in the school ’s @entity247 ; she dressed up for @entity249 day though the occasion fell in a chilly october			0
she was a member of the @entity251 and the @entity252			0
in 11th grade she was awarded a @entity254 for a rather odd image of a cat , lashing out at a mouse in a ballet shoe			0
her favorite food was pad @entity260			0
she competed with her peers in @entity262 that ended with a @entity263 in which seas of the school colors , green , blue , red , black and gold filled the stands at the playing field			0
one classmate who remembers @entity0 from those early days said : ‘ the thing that ’s so shocking is that there was nothing at all that made @entity0 different			1
‘ her parents are nice people , her sisters are great girls			0
but she met this guy , i guess , and everything changed			0
’ memorial : candles are lit for those who died in the @entity232 bombings and the subsequent police manhunt at a memorial on @entity284 in @entity2 , @entity45 april 21 , 2013 remembering : a couple embraces at a memorial on @entity284 to the victims of the @entity232 bombings in @entity2 flowers : a woman holds a flower at the memorial on @entity284 last night @entity0 was a student at @entity293 , @entity2 , when she met @entity127 , then a promising boxer and athlete			1
it was during that time that she converted and her youthful priorities appear to have changed as she left in 2010 without graduating			0
by then her relationship with @entity127 was intense			0
not even his arrest for violently assaulting her in 2009 could change that			0
according to @entity304 reports of the incident which took place in july at the @entity45 home she once shared with @entity127 , when interviewed she described @entity127 as ‘ a very nice man			0
’ certainly he was a man whose influence on @entity0 's life would prove profound			1
there is only one odd and unsettling inclusion in her own entry in her graduation @entity316			0
asked to provide a quotation she settled on one that would surely chime with the extremist views of her late husband			0
‘ do n’t take anything for granted , ’ she advises , before quoting a line from @entity324 's ' @entity323 ' : ‘ do n’t believe in yourself , do n’t deceive with belief , ’ the baffling lines run			0
‘ knowledge comes from death ’s release			0
