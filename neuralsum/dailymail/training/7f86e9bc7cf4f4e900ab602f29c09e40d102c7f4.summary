@entity7 , 74 , who founded and ran implant - maker @entity8 , is among those on trial in @entity11			0
the now - defunct company had claimed its factory in @entity2 exported to more than 60 countries and was one of the world 's leading implant makers			0
on trial : @entity7 , former head of @entity8 ( @entity20 ) , centre , and his lawyer @entity22 , left , arrive at the courtroom in @entity11 outraged : women wait in the @entity11 court room today for the opening of the trial of five executives of @entity20 accused of selling faulty breast implants the implants , which officials say are prone to rupture and leaking , were not sold in the @entity33 , but more than 125,000 women worldwide received them until sales ended in march 2010			1
of those , more than 5,000 are joining the trial as victims , saying the executives misled them into believing the implants were safe			1
@entity42 , who received the implants , said : ' we have the impression that he does n't care			1
i want him at least to recognise that he made mistakes			0
when you fight against cancer , you fight to survive , and if after they put some garbage in your body , what 's the point of fighting for life ? ' @entity7 declined to comment as he entered the convention centre - which was turned into a courthouse to host all those participating in the trial - in order to face the women for the first time			2
some of the hundreds of women who registered as plaintiffs at the trial on arrival at the @entity69 temporary courthouse the vast majority of the implants were for cosmetic reasons			1
the rest were for breast reconstruction , often following cancer surgery			0
in @entity2 , about a quarter of the implants malfunctioned , most by rupturing and leaking silicone			2
doctors and scientists who have followed the case say medical complications stemming from the ruptures and leaks appear to be limited even when the implants rupture			2
rashes and localised pain were the most common complaints			0
lawyers for the women - more than 300 from around the world who joined the month - long trial - say the full effects will not be known for years to come			2
@entity95 , a @entity96 lawyer who said she represents 1,500 women she says have had problems with the @entity20 implants , said she came to @entity11 to seek justice for clients she says lack the resources to pay for follow - up care			1
' i could name very difficult cases of women who do n't even have means to undergo exams and know what state their implants are in , " she said			1
@entity112 did not make any comment as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial ' they know that they are dangerous implants and nevertheless they do n't even have a way to know if their implants are broken inside their body , if eventually this substance will leak into their body			2
' the implants in question were not sold in the @entity33 , where concerns about silicone gel implants overall led to a 14 - year ban on their use			2
silicone implants there were brought back to the market in 2006 after research ruled out cancer , lupus and some other concerns			0
in @entity139 , the government left the choice up to women and their doctors , but recommended that the implants be removed if there was a sign of rupture			1
the company ultimately went out of business , and regulators across @entity150 began demanding calls for tighter oversight of medical devices			0
@entity7 has said he is ruined financially			0
according to various government estimates , over 42,000 women in @entity139 received the implants , more than 30,000 in @entity2 , 25,000 in @entity157 and 15,000 in @entity96			1
