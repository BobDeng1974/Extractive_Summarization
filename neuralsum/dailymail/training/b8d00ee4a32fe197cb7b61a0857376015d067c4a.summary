@entity0 , head teacher at @entity1 near @entity2 , who is under fire for booking a @entity5 holiday during term time an under fire headmistress has refused to apologise for arranging a @entity5 holiday during term time saying her ' private life is private '			1
last week it emerged that @entity0 , 53 , head of @entity13 , a primary school near @entity2 , is taking a week off after the @entity15 holidays for the break even though it will be the start of the school term			1
this is despite parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £ 60 per child for unauthorised absences , with mrs @entity0 being described as a ' hypocrite ' for booking the holiday			1
but now the head , who has been in charge of the school for 14 years , has refused to give an explanation or apologise for taking time off			1
she said : ' my private life is exactly what it says - private			1
' the website for the school , which caters for four to 11 - year - olds reminds parents to book breaks ‘ only in holiday time ’ and encourages pupils to achieve ‘ highest possible levels of attendance ’			1
it adds that the school ' will not authorise ' such absences and parents are fined £ 60 per parent per child per period of absence , which rises to £ 120 if not paid within 21 days			0
however , chair of governors @entity50 defended mrs @entity0 's holiday and said : ' she made what we have judged to be a request for a week off during term time for personal reasons which we have judged appropriate			1
' he added that mrs @entity0 was ' devoted , well - liked , extremely hardworking and effective ' but would not say why she was granted the leave			1
@entity59 said term - time leave for teachers was ' at the discretion ' of governors			0
a spokesman said the head told the council she had never previously taken holiday during term time during her 14 years at the school			1
however , an insider told a local newspaper : ' mr @entity50 told the governors he … had agreed it and that they had to pass it … three governors have since resigned , stating other reasons … the chairman now needs to take responsibility and resign himself			0
' in its last @entity78 inspection in 2009 , @entity13 was rated as outstanding and mrs @entity0 is thought to be paid around £ 45,000 a year			1
governors at @entity1 , pictured , approved mrs @entity0 's holiday despite the fact their website reminds parents to only book breaks during the school holidays on her friends reunited page , she describes herself as a former pe teacher now ‘ too old , fat and unfit ’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead			1
the mother - of - one , who is separated from her son ’s father , is understood to be travelling to the @entity5 , where average daytime temperatures in january are around @entity95 , with her partner			2
however , one parent of children at the school said : ' mrs @entity0 is taking a week off in the @entity100 after the children have gone back			1
' this is so unfair as teachers already get so many holidays and yet we would n't be allowed to take our children out of school for even a day			2
' some parents , whose children attend the school , pictured , have branded mrs @entity0 ' a hypocrite ' for booking the holiday another branded the decision as ' disgusting ' and added : ' i 've been fined twice for taking my children out of school and i put in a request to take them out next year and it 's been refused			1
' i think she should either give us an explanation why she is taking time off or at least grant people holiday to do it themselves			2
' another mother , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ it is disgraceful			0
[ mrs @entity0 ] is a hypocrite			1
we ca n’t take holidays in term - time so why should she ? the school is fast enough threatening parents with fines if they take their children out			1
’ it comes after families were told they were only allowed to take children out of school in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ under measures brought in by the last @entity136 , @entity137			0
the @entity139 family who took a holiday to the @entity142 island of @entity143 during term time			0
they are ( left to right ) @entity146 , mother @entity147 , @entity148 , father @entity149 and @entity150 previously , heads had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days ’ leave each year			0
parents wanted the flexibility of term - time holidays to avoid the punishing premiums holiday firms add in peak periods			2
parents who have branded mrs @entity0 a ' hypocrite ' for taking a holiday during school time have pointed to new measures , which mean they can be fined for taking their children on a term - time holiday			1
previously , head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year			2
however , under new measures brought in by former education secretary @entity137 , children can only be taken out of school in ' exceptional circumstances '			0
parents who take their children out of school without authorisation , they can face a fine of £ 60 for every child			2
those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted , fined £ 2,500 and even face jail			0
now they face a £ 60 fine each for every child who fails to attend school without permission – meaning a two - parent two - child family would be charged £ 240			0
those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted , jailed for up to three months and fined £ 2,500			0
in the @entity59 area , where @entity1 is located , 432 parents were issued with a fixed penalty notice for taking their children out of school , when their absence was not authorised between september 2013 and july 2014			2
this compares to just 39 fixed penalty notices , which were issued between september 2012 and july 2013			0
earlier this year , one of the first couples to be prosecuted for taking their family on holiday during term time were @entity149 and @entity198 from @entity199			2
the couple took their three children @entity148 , six , @entity146 , 13 , and @entity202 , 15 , to the @entity142 island of @entity143 last september			0
mr @entity139 , who works for the @entity204 said at the time that it was the first family holiday in five years as the couple had struggled to get time off work together			0
after refusing to pay the fines , they were prosecuted at @entity210 and fined £ 630			0
speaking at the time mr @entity139 said : ' i know education is important but there 's a bigger picture			0
family time is important too			0
' it has been estimated that more than 24,000 children skip school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak - time price hikes .			2
