by @entity0 published : 09:32 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 21 august 2013 we may be seeing more prominent gay and lesbian characters on tv shows , but the movie industry lags well behind the small screen , an advocacy group reports			1
out of the 101 releases from @entity12 's six major studios in 2012 , just 14 included characters identified as lesbian , gay , or bisexual , a report released today by the @entity9 showed			1
in its first study of @entity17 roles in major studio releases , @entity9 found that compared with tv , where there has been a significant shift over the past decade , ' major studios appear reluctant to include @entity17 characters in significant roles or franchises			1
' @entity27 was noted as a film of 2012 that included a bisexual character , played by @entity30 ( right ) , alongside @entity31 ( left ) , however the bisexual character was evil most of the 14 roles in 2012 were no more than cameos or minor roles , it said — and none of the films tracked had transgender characters			1
' until @entity17 characters appear more regularly in these studio films , there will be the appearance of bias , ' said @entity44 , @entity9 's national spokesperson , in an interview			1
he added that his organization will be meeting with studio executives to discuss the findings			0
there were some bright spots in 2012 , and some more ambiguous ones , the group said			2
for example , @entity27 , the hugely successful installment of the @entity54 franchise , featured a main villain , played by @entity30 , who was apparently bisexual			0
' it was great to see an @entity17 character in such a significant role , ' said @entity60 , associate director of entertainment media at @entity9 , also in an interview			1
' ' but unfortunately the character was also devious , psychotic , and untrustworthy — it fell into that trap			0
' this character , @entity67 , from the 2012 film @entity69 , released by @entity70 , was revealed at the end of the movie to be gay as genre films like comic book adaptations consume much of the studios ' capital and promotional efforts , the report says , such films have a striking lack of @entity17 characters			1
in @entity84 , it notes , there is a gay news anchor , but his appearance is ' so brief it was likely missed by many viewers			0
' the report — called the @entity90 — rates each of the six studio according to the number of @entity17 - inclusive films they released			1
faring worst : @entity96 and @entity97 , which each receive ' failing ' grades ; the other four — @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 — receive grades of ' adequate '			0
asked in advance tuesday afternoon about the report , the studios had no immediate comment			2
as part of its index , the group developed criteria to measure the quality of the @entity17 roles			1
the percentage of characters played by gay men , lesbians , bisexuals and male and females in @entity12 releases from 2012 they included : whether a character was identifiably @entity17 ; whether it was not solely or predominantly defined by its sexual orientation or gender identity ; and whether it was tied into the plot in such a way that its removal would have a significant effect			1
one of the best examples of an @entity17 - inclusive film in 2012 , according to @entity9 , was , interestingly , an animated family film : @entity69 , about a misunderstood boy who can communicate with the ghosts of dead people			1
in the film , which came from the @entity141 - based studio @entity140 , @entity138 's cheerleader sister asks the hunky football hero @entity67 for a movie date			2
he casually makes a reference to his boyfriend			0
the film 's writer and co-director , @entity149 , said the filmmakers , while determined to include the scene , had worried that it could cost them a pg rating and get them a @entity154 instead , which would have been inappropriate for the movie			2
in the end , they got their pg rating			0
@entity149 said he was disappointed with some negative commentary about the scene — including one viewer 's online review that praised the film for its anti-bullying message of inclusion — but said it ruined matters by making a character gay			2
' i was surprised at all the fuss , ' @entity149 said			0
' but on the flip side was the positive reaction			0
' the movie was the first animated film nominated for a @entity9 award			0
as a filmmaker , @entity149 said he was not optimistic that there would be an inevitable wave of more onscreen @entity17 characters as time goes on and society changes , as on tv			1
' it 's a mistake to assume it 's inevitable , ' he said			2
' the only way to make change is to do something about it			0
' ' we are moving in the right direction , ' @entity149 said			0
' but not nearly quick enough			0
' @entity60 , at @entity9 , said the new report would help reinforce its longtime claims that @entity12 studios need to do more			1
' over the years we have met with studios , and it 's always a point we make , ' @entity60 said			2
' now , we have the numbers to take to them			0

out of 101 releases of @entity12 's six major studios , just 14 included @entity17 characters in 2012
compared with tv shows , major studios are reluctant to include @entity17 characters
