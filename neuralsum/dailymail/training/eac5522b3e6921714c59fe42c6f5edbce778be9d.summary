by @entity0 a married prison officer has been jailed for having sex with a blonde inmate in her cell			1
@entity5 was given a 15 - prison sentence for sleeping with 22 - year - old @entity7 twice at @entity8 , @entity9			1
even though the 31 - year - old guard admitted the affair , @entity12 was told his wife has forgiven him and they are ' back together '			1
improper relationship : @entity5 , 31 , ( left ) had two secret trysts with inmate @entity7 , 22 ( right )			1
she was serving a six - year sentence for firearms offences a judge heard that @entity5 and @entity7 began flirting in 2012 while she was serving a six - year sentence for firearms offences			1
she worked in the hairdressing salon within the prison , which holds 600 inmates , and @entity5 first arranged to meet her alone there for sex under the pretence she had to collect some styling text books			1
prosecutor @entity28 said : ' @entity29 was nervous - she knew what she was doing was wrong but the defendant was reassuring , telling her it would be all right			0
' once in the salon , she kissed the defendant			0
he undressed her and they had full sexual intercourse			0
' mr @entity28 said @entity5 was ' very flattering ' as he returned her to her wing and said ' how brilliant she had been			2
' on august 5 , 2012 , @entity5 appeared at the door of @entity7 's cell out of hours , where he went inside the room and had sex with her again			1
this time , the prison 's cctv cameras captured the prison officer entering her cell and leaving ' minutes later '			2
mr @entity28 added : ' at the time , he had no permission or reason to go there			0
we see him go into the cell			0
once inside , he told her to lie on the bed			0
he kissed her , touched her and told her he loved her			0
' their relationship was uncovered when @entity7 confided in the prison 's gym instructor , who immediately reported @entity59 to the governor			2
that is when the @entity63 footage was reviewed and evidence of their tryst was exposed			0
@entity5 , of @entity67 , @entity68 , denied the allegations but eventually pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial			2
mr @entity28 said the defendant had worked at privately - run @entity72 since 2009 and was fully aware of the rules			1
secret arrangement : the pair first met in the salon of @entity72 , @entity9 , where @entity7 worked as a hairdresser			1
they then had sex in her cell where @entity63 captured the guard leaving ' minutes later ' he added : ' it was wholly wrong , it is a significant and wilful breach of trust and it is entirely against the law for a prison officer to engage in sexual intercourse with an inmate , with or without her consent			1
' @entity5 , whose wife initially left him after the affair came to light , held his head in his hands as he sat in the dock wearing a grey suit			1
his parents and other prominent members of his @entity99 community sat silently in the public gallery during the hearing			0
defence barrister @entity102 said her client and his family ' felt great shame ' over his actions , that he realised what he had done was wrong and asked for a suspended prison sentence			2
however , judge @entity109 jailed him for 15 months , and said : ' this was sexual behaviour that was consensual but you should not have engaged in it and you knew that			1
' you were married and attracted to her			0
you let yourself get carried away and , as a result , this matter came to light			0
you denied it and continued to deny it right up until the day of your trial			0
' the court heard @entity5 committed two further crimes while on bail			2
both related to breaches of a non-molestation order not to contact his wife , who had left him over his affair			2
however , the judge heard the couple had since patched things up and were now back together			1
judge @entity109 said : ' this relationship should never have led to sexual intercourse			1
it can have a significant emotional effect on a female prisoner			0
' because of the nature of a prison officer 's responsibilities - particularly when a male prison officer is employed in a female prison - this sort of behaviour must result in an immediate period of imprisonment			0
' @entity5 had been due to face other similar charges relating to misconduct with @entity29 and a second inmate , @entity148 , but prosecutors abandoned them after his guilty plea			2
the judge told him he would serve half of his sentence before being considered for release on licence .			0

@entity5 , 31 , was jailed for 15 months after bedding the inmate
@entity12 heard he *seduced* blonde prisoner @entity7
the 22 - year - old was serving a six - year sentence at @entity72 , @entity9
pair had sex in the prison salon where she worked as a hairdresser
judge @entity109 heard the second time was in her own cell
despite the affair , @entity5 and his wife have ' patched things up '
