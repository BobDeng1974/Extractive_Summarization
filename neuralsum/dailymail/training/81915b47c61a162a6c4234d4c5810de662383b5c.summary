by @entity0 death : @entity2 , 39 , died after being restrained by up to five police officers during a drugs search in @entity5 five police officers will face gross misconduct hearings but no criminal charges over the death of a man who collapsed after being restrained during a drugs search			1
@entity2 , 39 , died after he was forced to the ground in a car park in @entity5 , @entity13 in 2008 by police who believed he was hiding class a drugs in his mouth			1
officers alleged that he refused to reveal a package of drugs hidden in his mouth			1
when a struggle followed , he collapsed			0
after an inquest into his death , the @entity23 decided that there was not enough evidence for charges of manslaughter by gross negligence , misconduct in public office , perjury and perverting the course of justice			2
but the officers from @entity37 could face the sack after the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) found grounds for gross misconduct because the police gave different statements to the coroner and the @entity39			1
today , his distraught relatives reacted with fury as prosecutors decided not to bring charges in the case			0
mr @entity2 's sister @entity51 said : ‘ we are not happy that the @entity23 has decided not to charge those police officers who are responsible for @entity2 's death			1
’ in 2008 , an initial inquiry into mr @entity2 's death was conducted by the @entity39 , but it was not referred to the @entity23			1
two years later , mr @entity2 ’s girlfriend @entity57 told a court that up to five officers restrained him as they tried to force the package out of his throat , including one officer who shouted ‘ break his arm ’			2
in 2011 , the case was re-opened and new evidence emerged during police officers ' accounts of what had taken place			2
the investigation also looked at further opinion from restraint experts and doctors			0
but the inquest was abandoned after concerns were raised about the difference in statements the police had given to the coroner and what they had previously told the @entity39			2
the @entity82 is also considering the conduct of a @entity85 solicitor in relation to mr @entity2 's death			2
family man : @entity2 is pictured with his wife and two of his children before his death mr @entity2 's sister @entity51 added : ‘ at the inquest they are caught out withholding evidence in front of everyone including the judge and jury			1
' we have evidence of police cover - ups , so not only is it my opinion that they caused my brother 's death but these police officers have not given a full and truthful account			2
' how on earth can cps disregard the facts ? ‘ this sadly shows that the @entity23 together with the @entity39 are only there to protect and cover up police crimes			0
‘ their decision has only shown their true colours but made us much stronger			0
‘ this is not justice for us and we will not give up until justice is served and that is a promise			0
’ @entity120 : the officers , from @entity37 , could face the sack as watchdog the @entity39 found grounds for gross misconduct @entity126 , @entity39 associate commissioner , said : ‘ this has been a complex investigation which as we have said has taken an unbearably long time for mr @entity2 's family			1
‘ i am very sorry for the prolonged distress this has caused , but it has been essential to ensure that our investigation was robust and thorough			0
‘ five officers and a solicitor were interviewed under caution and we felt there was sufficient evidence to refer to the @entity23			0
' in light of the @entity23 decision , we have now sent the report to the family of mr @entity2 and the @entity82			2
' in accordance with procedures under the @entity148 @entity37 were sent a copy of the report in january 2014 and they have determined that five officers should now face gross misconduct hearings			1
' we have also sent a copy of the report to the coroner in advance of the inquest into mr @entity2 's tragic and untimely death			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity23 added that it was unable to establish a causal link , to the criminal standard , between the conduct of @entity37 officers and mr @entity2 's death			1
they also questioned whether alterations made to their statements were intended or able to pervert the course of justice			0
he said : ‘ the case has been thoroughly reviewed in accordance with the @entity173			0
' ‘ we carefully examined the evidence in this case , including evidence provided by experts in pathology , emergency medicine and policing techniques and accounts from eyewitnesses			0
’ ‘ since there is insufficient evidence to give rise to a realistic prospect of convicting any person of any criminal offence arising from the circumstances of mr @entity2 's death , we have advised the @entity39 that no further criminal action should be taken			1
‘ our thoughts remain with mr @entity2 's family at this difficult time for them and we fully understand that this is not the decision they will have wanted			0
' we have written to them to explain our decision in detail and have offered to meet with them to discuss this matter should they so wish			0
