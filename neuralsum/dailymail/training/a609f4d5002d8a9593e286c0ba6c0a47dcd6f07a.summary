by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 12:34 est , 14 december 2012 a 12 - year - old girl who uses a wheelchair was left in tears after @entity7 agents detained her for nearly an hour at a @entity9 airport after saying they found traces of bomb residue on her hands , her mother claimed today			1
@entity13 was travelling to @entity14 with her mother , @entity15 , for treatment for her brittle bone disorder when she was stopped at @entity18 in @entity9			1
a @entity7 agent swabbed @entity13 's hands and she tested positive for explosives			1
but the wheelchair , which is likely to have transferred any substance to her hands as she pushed it , was never tested , her mother said			2
@entity15 told @entity35 that they even called a bomb specialist to the scene , while other passengers reportedly spoke out in support of @entity40 and offered her tissues and candy			2
' there were people saying , " really ? you 're going to do this to her ? y'all have to take her somewhere private where she 's not out in the public and everyone can see her " , ' @entity13 told @entity35 in @entity48			2
' ordeal : her mother said she was not allowed to get close to her crying daughter to comfort her bizarre : they had to wait for an hour in front of hundreds of travellers while the @entity7 called a bomb expert after nearly an hour , @entity15 said agents suddenly told them they were free to pass through the security checkpoint but offered no explanation for the incident			1
' it 's okay , you did n't do anything wrong , we 're going to get you on your way , ' an agent can be heard telling @entity13 in the video as she cries into her hands			1
the youngster and her mother made it just in time for their flight			0
but @entity13 said that a check of wheelchair could have revealed the @entity7 's mistake much earlier			1
' it could have come off fertilizer , because we have chickens , ' she told @entity86			0
' it could have just come off the ground , because i roll through everything			0
' enraged : @entity13 said they should have checked the wheelchair as she had probably rolled through something annoyed : her mother , @entity15 , said the @entity7 needs to reconsider how it treats children her mother added that she had been left outraged by the way her daughter was treated			1
' i am by no means undermining our safety in the air , ' she said			0
' after 9/11 , by no means am i doing that			0
but when it comes to children , common sense is not in a textbook			0
' but the @entity7 defended the incident in a statement			2
' we are sensitive to the concerns of passengers who were not satisfied with their screening experience and we invite those individuals to provide feedback to @entity7 through a variety of channels , ' it said			1
' we work to balance those concerns with the very real threat that our adversaries will attempt to use explosives to carry out attacks on planes			0
' scene : the @entity7 said they try to balance considerate screenings with the threats of air travel the video is just the latest to bring the @entity7 's responses into question			1
last month , representative @entity133 of @entity9 claimed his 17 - year - old niece had her dress pulled down after she was taken aside to be screened at @entity136 in @entity137			0
the incident happened two years ago but came to light under the @entity140 after it was caught on surveillance camera			0
@entity133 has called for the agent to be fired			0
and last year , two other wheelchair users , @entity144 and @entity145 from @entity14 , claim they were forced up from their wheelchairs and groped under their girls by agents at @entity149 in @entity150 .			2

video shows @entity13 as she is held in front of hundreds of passengers
@entity7 agents ' would not let her mother get close to comfort her '
' did not check her wheelchair which had probably rolled through something '
