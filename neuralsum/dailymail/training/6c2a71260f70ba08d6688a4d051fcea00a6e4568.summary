by @entity0 published : 00:45 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 03:43 est , 3 march 2014 @entity2 , leader of @entity3 said most councils were planning to put up charges in more than one area thousands of families face inflation - busting rises to parking , pest control and waste charges this year , a survey has found			1
councils are planning to introduce fees in new areas , such as rat control - with one even charging parents whose children use care home facilities			1
some authorities are putting up parking charges by 10 or 20 per cent , while others are setting up @entity23 in bus lanes for the first time - to make it easier to fine motorists who use them			1
others are charging households to move bulky or garden waste , while another has increased the cost of holding a funeral at its crematorium			0
cash - strapped councils blame @entity37 budget cuts for the huge rises , and some are making frontline staff such as home helps , cleaners and dustbin men redundant			1
but , shockingly , an analysis of job vacancies posted by councils shows that many are continuing to recruit advisers in areas such as diversity and carbon reduction - while claiming to be short of funds			1
critics say local authorities should be doing more to eliminate waste and reducing exorbitant salaries for chief executives and senior directives			2
however , council finance experts warn that further increases to charges are inevitable as local authorities face budget cuts of £ 2billion this year			1
@entity2 , leader of @entity66 councillors in @entity67 and @entity68 , said that most councils were planning to put up charges in more than one area			2
‘ this government wants us to be entrepreneurs and much more businesslike , so we are starting to charge for services that used to be free , ’ he said			0
‘ this comes after our grants have been cut by 40 per cent over the last three years			0
’ the survey by the @entity79 newspaper says councils are also likely to shed up to another 100,000 jobs this year , bringing the total number of job losses to more than 500,000 since the beginning of the present @entity85 in 2010			2
several authorities , including @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 are planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs across areas including care , cleaning , and waste collection			1
@entity3 is planning to charge £ 43 to tackle rat problems most authorities are still finalising their council tax increases , but nearly two thirds of the 350 councils are to freeze their rates from next month , including almost all the @entity103 boroughs where elections are being held this year			1
however , one third of councils have proposed tax increases of less than two per cent , effectively defying a pledge by @entity109 , the chancellor , to freeze them			0
about half of these have set a figure of 1.99 per cent , narrowly missing the rise that would force them to hold a referendum of residents on the issue			0
@entity119 and @entity120 has suggested a 4.75per cent rise - triggering a referendum - but this may be overturned by the full council			0
mr @entity2 , who is leader of @entity3 council , told the @entity79 that , for the first time , his authority would introduce charges for children in care			1
@entity3 is also planning to charge parents whose children are put in care he said that many children spent only six to eight weeks in care homes when their families were having difficulties , but the cost of keeping them there was more than £ 2,000 a week			1
‘ we are asking families who can afford it to pay towards the cost of their children , ’ he said			0
‘ it is only about £ 50 a week rather than £ 2,000 , but it ’s also to show them that they have to take responsibility			0
’ @entity3 is also introducing a £ 43 charge for rat control , which is reduced for pensioners to £ 23			1
‘ we are also having to remove pensioner subsidies for allotments and bowling centres and we have put up parking charges in line with inflation , ’ he said			0
@entity162 in central @entity103 has increased the cost of residents ’ parking permits by 16 per cent over two years , @entity160 in the @entity161 is proposing a 10 per cent increase in parking fees , and the @entity168 plans to raise its charges by 20 per cent			0
other councils , such as @entity89 , are introducing new parking fees			1
authorities such as @entity173 are introducing £ 25 charges for the removal of bulky rubbish and for garden waste , and @entity179 council in @entity180 has proposed increasing cremation fees by £ 30			2
many authorities are closing youth services , @entity184 centres and family services			0
@entity187 , chairman of the @entity188 , said : ‘ councils are now having to decide between investing in safer roads or safer children			2
’ @entity192 , the @entity193 , has warned councils not to raise parking charges , which , he argues , hit local residents and retailers			0
@entity198 , the local government minister , said yesterday : ‘ we are reining in councils ’ over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair fines , have scrapped @entity204 ’s plans for bin charging and are giving extra funding to councils to help freeze council tax			2
’ @entity209 said that councils were still spending lavishly on entertaining and travelling while many were still recruiting staff for oddly - titled jobs			1
among recent job advertisements were , for example , a ‘ lead supplier relationship manager ’ , on £ 42,000 , for @entity217 , to improve supplier performance and be the ‘ go - to ’ person when market information is needed			2
a spokesman for the alliance said : ‘ for too long town halls have picked people ’s pockets with tax hikes			0
now that the pressure is on to freeze tax is no excuse to use stealthy ways to raise revenue			0
