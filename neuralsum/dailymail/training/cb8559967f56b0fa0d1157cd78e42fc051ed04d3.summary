he said : ' ever since i was a little boy i was a bit of a hoarder			2
and i have always been a bit insecure			0
' but it was always manageable			0
it was silly but manageable			0
but i had a bad accident back in 1997 where i was run over by a ten tonne lorry and i started struggling			2
' in 2004 that is when the hoarding took off i was buying all sorts of things from @entity53 , book shops you name it - books , dvds , cds. ' i started a serious coin collection			1
i was spending hundreds and hundred of pounds on coins			2
still collecting stamps which i have done quite seriously since 1994 , but the coins were a new one			1
' i had a gp came round in february 2009 to try and sort things out about how we are going to move on for me and the sofa was clear			0
' so it has absolutely mushroomed over the last two or three years			0
i believe it is a subset of @entity72 called @entity73			0
' i have been not diagnosed with this but clearly that is something i have got			0

at least i have now got a week hopefully to try and sort out the important things and more importantly find somewhere else to live			0

' @entity6 recognised he had a problem with hoarding and had started clearing up			1
but when the agent started taking him to court he felt under pressure and the stress caused him to start again			0
