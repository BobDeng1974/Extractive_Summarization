@entity0 believes it is ' essential ' @entity2 sign a new striker during the transfer window if they want to challenge for major silverware			1
@entity7 boss @entity6 is refusing to panic buy a replacement for @entity9 , who has been ruled out until the @entity10 with a broken tibia			1
@entity9 's injury has limited @entity6 's striking options to @entity14 , who is more effective as a winger , and the inexperienced @entity16 and @entity17			1
pain game : @entity9 looks set to be out of action until the new year with an ankle injury @entity21 can play up front but has been linked with a move away from the @entity24 , while another possibility , @entity26 , is sidelined with a knee problem			2
former @entity28 marksman @entity0 believes @entity6 must add firepower to his squad before the transfer window closes on monday			1
' @entity2 needed to sign a forward whether @entity9 was injured or not , ' said @entity0 , who was speaking as part of @entity34 ' campaign			1
in the goals : @entity9 scored @entity2 's equalizer against @entity37 at the weekend ' now that he 's injured it 's essential for them really if they 're to compete for major titles ' forward is one position where they needed to strengthen			1
you could say in midfield too , but particularly up - front			0
' if they could add a player who could guarantee 25 - goals a season that would be hugely beneficial to them			0
' @entity6 has showed a lot of faith in @entity9 and he 's a good player who will score goals , but he 's not hugely prolific and lacks a bit of pace to be that			2
' taking his chance : @entity6 could decide to use @entity17 instead of buying a striker @entity14 operated as lone striker in wednesday night 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity62 and rewarded @entity6 's faith by opening his @entity2 account with a goal that secured the @entity7 ' place in the @entity68 group stage			2
however , @entity69 shares a widely - held belief that the Â£ 35million signing from @entity72 is better suited to a wider role			0
' striker is n't @entity14 's natural position , he prefers it out wide , certainly on the right - hand side of a three , ' @entity0 said			0
stepping up : @entity6 believes new signing @entity14 can play in a more forward role ' i 'm sure he can play striker because he 's a terrific player , but i 'm not sure it brings out the best in him			0
' he 's better when he 's facing people and going at them , rather than having his back to goal			0
' @entity14 was superb against @entity62 with a glaring second - half miss failing to devalue an energetic performance full of desire and commitment .			0

@entity9 has been ruled out until the beginning of next year
@entity6 says he is unlikely to buy a replacement in this window
@entity0 says @entity2 must buy a replacement if they want to win anything this season
