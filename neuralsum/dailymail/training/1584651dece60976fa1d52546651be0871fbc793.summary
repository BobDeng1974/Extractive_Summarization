a revolutionary new concept developed by @entity2 's father is to be put through its paces in @entity4			1
@entity7 ' @entity6 ' , the led display system sits on top of the air intake above the driver 's head and primarily provides race - position data			1
using information supplied by race control , data can also be displayed as to who has set the fastest lap , tyre strategy and flag condition via multiple colours			2
the @entity22 system , designed by @entity23 driver @entity2 's father , sits on top of the air intake section of the car the wing can display a variety of messages as well as transmitting race positional data back to the pit lane the @entity32 is to initially test the @entity6 on the safety car during its assessment runs of the @entity35 , either on thursday or friday			1
@entity36 will run a further test of the unit on top of their car next tuesday on the first day of a two - day test that follows sunday 's season - ending grand prix			2
@entity2 said : ' the test is to decide whether the unit is practical for @entity23 and single seaters			2
' also , whether the led display can be seen from the grandstands , and whether it works for the tv audience			0
' the idea behind the system is to provide race - position data plus other race information to the viewing public			1
' one of the major problems with watching race cars is knowing who is where and who is who without having to take your eyes off the action to find and locate the information on a hand - held device , or one of the circuit monitors			2
the new system is set to be tested by @entity36 following the season - ending @entity67 in @entity4 @entity2 ( left ) with his son @entity68 after his success in the @entity70 @entity67 in @entity71 ' by the time you have found the information the car has gone past and you 're no better off , and having missed the action as well			1
' it might not work			0
we might not be able to see the leds in the bright sunlight , but it is the concept i hope could be of interest			0
' it might require further work on the intensity of the @entity22 , but i believe this has the potential to make a huge impact on the viewing of races and tests , making it more informative and enjoyable			0
' hopefully it could bring new fans to the sport , and old fans back as well			0
' patent pending , the @entity98 prototype will run in @entity4 , with a @entity101 version currently in development			0
that design incorporates a new - shaped camera mount and a double - led display that incorporates not only race - position data , but also the first three letters of a driver 's surname			1
@entity2 is also developing a version for @entity115 ( @entity114 touring cars ) , @entity111 , @entity110 , karting and motor bikes .			0

@entity2 has designed an ' info wing ' for @entity23 cars
the @entity22 system sits on top of the air intake section of the car
it will provide race - position data and other information
the new system will be tested in @entity4 before the @entity67
