as the old saying goes , ' keep your friends close and your enemies closer '			0
but this cricket took the old adage to a new level as it perched on the head of a green papua tree frog - its natural predator			1
the brave insect dices with death , crawling along a red petal as the frog used the flower as a makeshift resting spot			2
making its move : the brave cricket dices with death as it clambers on to a petal where a green papua tree frog - its natural predator - is relaxing friends close , enemies closer : the cricket does not seem fussed by the frog as it walks along the petal , standing on the amphibian 's side not cricket : usually the frog would gobble up the insect without a thought , but the two seem to become friends as the cricket explores the creature 's face as it crawls forward , the cricket brushes against the frog , standing on its side and almost poking the frog in the eye			1
seemingly taking a shine to each other , the cricket then climbs atop the amphibian 's head , standing over its left eye - just an inch from the frog 's mouth			1
the cricket gets itself comfortable on the frog 's head before , settling down for a quick snooze on his unlikely friend			1
the green papua tree frog is predominantly found in the north and east of @entity56 , as well as southern parts of @entity58 and @entity59			1
living mostly in swamps and pond areas , it thrives in wet , humid conditions			0
they are not endangered , but are often eaten by cats and dogs			0
in @entity59 , as many as 75,000 of the frogs are exported to become pets a year			2
the incredible pictures were taken by nature photographer @entity70 in her back garden in @entity72 , on the east of @entity74 , @entity59			1
' this set is about two different species , a predator and his prey , taking a rest together on the petal of a flower , ' the 42 - year - old said			2
' they sat with each other for a long time , which i found weird as a cricket would usually be a frog 's main course for dinner			1
' they seemed to make friends with each other , which was actually quite cute			0
' ms @entity70 said : ' i was surprised that this happened , as usually the frog would devour the cricket in seconds , especially if he was hungry			2
' it was n't planned at all			0
i left them to quickly get my camera and lens , and when i came back they still were still sat peacefully			0
' many people are as surprised as me and ask a same question , why did this happen ? nature is a mystery			0
' i love photography because it teaches me things that can not see by the naked eye , ' she added			0
settling down : the cricket shuffles around as it gets itself comfortable , as the frog waits patiently for its new friend to stop moving the incredible pictures were taken by nature photographer @entity70 in her back garden in @entity72 , on the east of @entity74 , @entity59 that 's better : resting its head on top of the frog 's forehead , the pair look very content as they lay down for a quick snooze together			1

a cricket clambers onto a red flower , only to find a green papua tree frog - its natural predator - waiting
but the cricket is not fussed by this , and crawls up the frog 's back before *hopping* on to its head as it rests
the cricket even stands on the amphibian 's eye while getting comfortable as it appears the two have made friends
