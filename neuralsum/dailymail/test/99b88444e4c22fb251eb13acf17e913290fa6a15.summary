since @entity1 penned his novel @entity3 more than 150 years ago , scientists have been fascinated by the remarkable attributes of the sperm whale and its kin - the smaller pygmy and dwarf whales			1
now , fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago , have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales			1
the remains , which were discovered in @entity15 , indicate that the organ involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the whale ’s evolution			1
fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales			1
this image shows the right lateral view of the skull of @entity26 although why this is so remains a mystery			0
while many whales , dolphins and porpoises have a long fossil record , enabling scientists to understand their evolution , there is limited evidence of sperm whales and smaller pygmy and dwarf whales , which are capable of navigating the ocean deep underwater			1
now an international team of scientists , led by the @entity44 of @entity45 has discovered a new species of extinct pygmy sperm whale , called @entity26 , which clarifies key aspects of the evolution of these animals			1
the well - preserved skulls of two individuals were unearthed at a sea cliff along the @entity55 coast of @entity15			0
the find will help experts fill in gaps in the evolution of cetaceans			0
this is the evolutionary tree of sperm whales showing links between extinct and living species , and when the spermaceti organ changed shape the remains , which were discovered in @entity15 , indicate that the bone involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the evolution of the sperm whale			1
in contrast modern sperm whales ( a stock image is shown ) are much larger than their extinct relatives the sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator			1
it 's only one of three living species in the sperm whale family , along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale			1
mature males reach an average length of 52 ft ( 16 metres ) with their head making up one third of their length			0
they mostly dine on squid and swim to depths of 7,380 ft ( 2,250 metres ) to hunt for prey			0
they are the second deepest diving mammal , following only @entity96 's beaked whale			0
the sperm whale 's clicking vocalisation - a form of echolocation and communication - can be as loud as 230 decibels underwater , making it the loudest sound produced by any animal			1
it has the largest brain of any animal on @entity108 , more than five times heavier than a human 's and can live for more than 60 years			0
it reveals an unexpected level of complexity in the evolution of the spermaceti , which is an organ located within the head that plays a key role in the generation of sound and in the whale ’s capacity for echolocation			2
the study , published in the journal @entity124 , shows that at one time small sperm whales measuring around seven feet ( two metres in length ) had a much larger spermaceti organ relative to their size than modern day relatives			2
it got downsized at least twice during their evolutionary history , including the evolutionary event that gave origin to the living pygmy and dwarf sperm whales			2
lead researcher dr @entity139 said : ‘ the new discovery gives us a better understanding of the ancient distribution of these poorly known relatives of the sperm whale			2
‘ previously we knew of similarly - aged pygmy and dwarf whales from @entity148 and @entity149 , but this new fossil fills in an important geographic gap in the group ’s ancient distribution			0
’ he added : ' our study is part of a larger scientific effort aimed at understanding the changes in the marine habitats that resulted from the complete closure of the @entity160 , ' referring to the separation between the eastern @entity162 and the @entity163 that took place sometime within the last 10 million years			0
the new fossil is known from the well - preserved skulls of two individuals which were unearthed at a sea cliff along the @entity55 coast of @entity15 , shown on this map the fossils show that at one time small sperm whales measuring around seven feet ( two metres in length ) had a much larger spermaceti organ relative to their size			2
a dorsal view of the fossilised skull is shown			0

team of scientists discovered new species of extinct pygmy sperm whale
seven million - year - old @entity26 *isthmia* bones were found in @entity15
suggest the bone involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the whale ’s evolution
today 's larger sperm whales are able to navigate under water with ease
