by @entity0 published : 13:23 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 11 march 2013 a judge has set aside an elderly woman ’s will because of pressure applied by her ‘ forceful ’ son			1
two years before she died aged 98 , @entity6 , changed her will from leaving her house to her two sons to leaving it just to one of them			1
the will she wrote in 2006 superseded one she had written in 1990 , in which she left her @entity14 farmhouse to be shared equally between her sons @entity16 , now 62 , and @entity17 , now 60			1
@entity16 , left , was ordered to share his late mother 's @entity14 farm with his younger brother @entity20 , right today , a judge at @entity23 's @entity22 pronounced in favour of the 1990 will , saying that the ' violent ' and ' irrational ' older brother had used ' undue influence ' on his mother to get her to make the second will in which she left the whole house to him			1
@entity31 's son @entity17 , 60 , had challenged the new will on the basis that his mother did not have proper capacity , did not know what she was doing and was improperly influenced to leave @entity36 , near @entity37 , to his older brother			1
after a four - day hearing , mr @entity39 pronounced in favour of the 1990 will , restoring the younger brother ’s half - share of the value of the house - worth about £ 160,000			2
he also ordered @entity16 to pay the costs of the ' regrettable ' action , estimated at around £ 110,000			2
today , the judge said that the brothers were at such loggerheads that @entity16 felt ' hatred ' towards @entity17 , who ran a car - breaking business on land next to the house			1
he said that he younger did not seem to feel quite as strongly			2
the court heard that part of the explanation might be @entity16 's view - denied by his younger brother - that @entity17 had an affair with his brother ’s first wife and behaved inappropriately , stopping short of a full affair , with his second			1
@entity36 in @entity14 , seen here next to @entity17 's car - breaking business , will now be sold the judge said : ' he [ @entity16 ] is , in my view , somewhat obsessed with his feelings towards his brother and a feeling that they were treated unequally by their parents throughout their lives			1
' as far as i can see this perception of inequality is unjustified			0
' what has happened is that @entity16 has made different life choices and different choices towards the acquisition of cash as opposed to land			2
' @entity16 was also a man ' of violent character ' who received a prison sentence for assaulting the partner of his former wife at a wedding in 2004 , said the judge			1
he had also shoved shears through an open car window towards his brother ’s head or neck , though he did not make contact , and been verbally abusive to customers visiting @entity17 ’s vehicle repair business			0
' his behaviour was bad verging on the irrational on a very significant number of occasions , ' the judge added			0
the judge said that @entity6 was remarkably alert and active until becoming frail after a fall in may 2005			1
but she still understood the world , and the people around her , and clearly had testamentary capacity and understood the will			0
however , undue influence on the part of @entity16 , who gave up his job to move in to look after his mother , was established , he added			2
in pronouncing against the 2006 will and in favour of the 1990 version , @entity16 ’s personality was an important factor , said the judge			1
' he was a forceful man with a forceful physical presence			0
i repeat that i find there was no question of physical abuse , or even of real emotional abuse			0
' i am sure that he will have experienced frustrations in looking after his elderly mother which many less volatile personalities will experience			0
however , the fact is he was a powerful personality and his mother was much more vulnerable			0
' @entity16 ’s keenly felt view that he had not been treated equally with his brother is an important point			2
' he would be more inclined to try to even things up			0
i think that he did so , by way of suggestion to his mother			0
' he had clear views about his entitlement to his " inheritance "			0
' the judge also said that @entity16 was instrumental in sowing in his mother ’s mind the desirability of his having the house , and in doing so he took advantage of her vulnerability			1
he added : ' it is not possible to determine any more than that the precise form of the pressure , or its occasion or occasions , but it is not necessary to do so			0
' i am satisfied that this will results from some form of undue influence			0
' the farmhouse will now be sold and the older brother 's share is expected to be swallowed up in the costs of the legal action .			2

@entity6 died in 2008 , leaving @entity14 farmhouse to older son @entity16
younger son @entity20 , now 60 , said earlier will had shared it between them
high court judge says earlier will should apply as @entity16 , 62 , was ' forceful '
