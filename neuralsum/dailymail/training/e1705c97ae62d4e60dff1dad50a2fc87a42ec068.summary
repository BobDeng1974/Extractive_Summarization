by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 04:16 est , 30 january 2013 @entity2 's army chief said political strife was pushing the state to the brink of collapse it 's a stark warning from the institution that ran the country until last year as @entity11 's first freely elected leader struggles to contain bloody street violence			0
general @entity13 , appointed by president @entity14 last year to head the military , added in a statement on tuesday that one of the primary goals of deploying troops in cities on the @entity21 was to protect the waterway that is vital for @entity2 's economy and world trade			1
@entity2 protesters clash with security forces in front of the @entity29 hotel in @entity11 today @entity2 protesters celebrate the capture of a state security armoured vehicle seized in @entity33 square @entity35 protesters celebrate on the military vehicle as troops try to control the recent outbreak of trouble @entity41 's comments , published on an official army facebook page , followed 52 deaths in the past week as a result of disorder			1
it highlighted the mounting sense of crisis facing @entity2 and its @entity50 head of state who is struggling to fix a teetering economy and needs to prepare @entity2 for a parliamentary election in a few months that is meant to cement the new democracy			0
after almost seven months since @entity14 took office , @entity2 politics have become even more deeply polarised			1
opponents spurned a call by @entity14 for talks on monday to try to end the violence			1
instead , protesters have rallied in @entity11 and @entity63 , and in the three @entity21 cities - @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 - where @entity14 imposed emergency rule			1
today , thousands were again on the streets of @entity65 to mourn the deaths of two people in the latest clashes there , taking the total toll in @entity77 port alone to 42 people			0
most were killed by gunshots in a city where weapons are rife			0
@entity82 , a @entity65 resident speaking by telephone , heard heavy gunfire through the night			2
' gunshots damaged the balcony of my flat , so i went to stay with my brother , ' he said			0
residents in the three canal cities had taken to the streets in protest at a nightly curfew now in place there			2
protesters opposing @entity2 president @entity14 shout slogans as they march despite a night - time curfew in the city of @entity67 last night @entity2 protesters defied curfew in restive towns along the @entity21 , attacking police stations and ignoring emergency rule imposed by president @entity14 to end days of clashes that have killed at least 52 in @entity11 on tuesday afternoon , police again fired teargas as stone - throwing youths in a street near @entity112 , the centre of the 2011 uprising			1
@entity2 army chief @entity114 said political strife was pushing state to brink of collapse but the clashes were less intense than previous days and traffic was able to cross the area			2
street cleaners swept up the remains of burnt tyres and other debris			0
street flare - ups are a common occurrence in divided @entity2 , frustrating many people desperate for order and economic growth			2
although the general 's comments were notably blunt , @entity2 's military has voiced similar concerns in the past , pledging to protect the nation			2
but it has refused to be drawn back into a direct political role after its reputation as a neutral party took a pounding during the 17 months after @entity140 fell			0
' @entity2 are really alarmed by what is going on , ' said @entity11 - based analyst @entity142 , adding that the army was reflecting that broader concern among the wider public			2
' but i do n't think it should be taken as a sign that the military is on the verge of stepping in and taking back the reins of government , ' he added			0
it seemed unlikely that @entity41 was signalling the army wants to take back the power it held for six decades since the end of the colonial era and through an interim period after the overthrow of former air force chief @entity140 two years ago			0
but his message sent a powerful message that @entity2 's biggest institution , with a huge economic as well as security role and a recipient of massive direct @entity167 subsidies , is worried about the fate of the nation , after five days of turmoil in major cities			1
' the continuation of the struggle of the different political forces ... over the management of state affairs could lead to the collapse of the state , ' said @entity179 , who is also defence minister in the government @entity14 appointed			1
he said the economic , political and social challenges facing the country represented ' a real threat to the security of @entity2 and the cohesiveness of the @entity2 state ' and the army would remain ' the solid and cohesive block ' on which the state rests			0
general @entity13 said that one of the primary goals of deploying troops in cities on the @entity21 was to protect the waterway that is vital for @entity2 's economy and world trade @entity41 was picked by @entity14 after the army handed over power to the new president in june once @entity14 had sacked field marshal @entity199 , in charge of @entity2 during the transition and who had also been @entity140 's defence minister for 20 years			1
since the 2011 revolt , @entity50 who @entity140 spent his 30 - year rule suppressing have won two referendums , two parliamentary elections and a presidential vote			0
but that legitimacy has been challenged by an opposition that accuses @entity14 of imposing a new form of authoritarianism			1
@entity14 's supporters says protesters want to overthrow @entity2 's first ever democratically elected leader by undemocratic means			1
the instability has provoked unease in @entity219 capitals , where officials worry about the direction of a powerful regional player that has a peace deal with @entity225			0
the @entity167 condemned the bloodshed and called on @entity2 leaders to make clear violence was not acceptable			0
@entity35 placards held aloft in the city of @entity67 last night show just how divided @entity2 still is despite revolution			1

protesters defy night - time curfews in cities along @entity21
troops deployed to cities on @entity21 to protect trade
