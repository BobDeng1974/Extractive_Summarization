by @entity0 upset : nail technician @entity1 used a mobile to check @entity3 while abroad and was handed a bill for £ 3,000 a teenager who wanted to stay in touch with friends on @entity3 while on holiday was left ' devastated ' after she was sent a shock bill for almost £ 3,000			1
@entity1 , 18 , used the @entity11 mobile , which is in her mother @entity12 's name , while they were on a fortnight 's break together in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the teenager , from @entity20 , was using @entity3 , @entity21 and @entity22 to chat to friends , downloading @entity23 of data , and managed to rack up a bill for £ 2,907 last month			1
she believed she was on the hotel 's @entity26 , but was also charged by @entity11 at £ 8 per mb because her data roaming was also on , she said			1
miss @entity1 said : ' when i got the bill i was in complete shock - i could n't speak			1
i just kept saying i 'm in debt , i ca n't afford to pay it			1
' they need to warn people and be open about the costs of roaming			0
when i spoke to them i said " i have n't called anyone , i have n't sent any texts , it ca n't be right "			0
' i work in a salon and you hear so many stories like mine where people have had a shock bill			0
her father @entity49 , 43 , said @entity1 was in tears when she got home to discover the bill			1
she is a trainee nail technician and on the minimum wage but i told her she was going to have to pay because we could n't afford to			1
' the thing is that if she had sent the same amount of data in texts , rather than using the internet , the bill would have been more like £ 350			2
cry for help : the 18 - year - old tweeted in the days after returning that she was going to have to pay the debt holiday : @entity1 with with her mum @entity12 in @entity17 where surfing the internet costs £ 8 per mb with @entity11 mr @entity69 said he bought a data bundle before they went abroad ' but it clearly was n't enough '			1
in shock : miss @entity1 said @entity11 and other companies should do better at warning about roaming costs he added that @entity11 shut off the phone and contacted her daughter when the bill hit £ 1,000 , part - way through the holiday , only to tell her that there was a mix - up and it was reactivated again			1
they then contacted her again on the day she came back , when the bill was now at £ 2,907 , he said			1
mr @entity69 added : ' i think there should be a cap , there are with other networks			0
she has a £ 30 a month contract , when anyone 's bill hits double that they should be contacted in my view , not when it reaches £ 1,000			2
' @entity11 said today it had sent texts to the phone to point out the data use , and had demanded the bill to be paid			1
but it has since decided to slash it to around £ 250			1
a spokesman told the @entity101 : ' in this instance , mrs @entity1 purchased a bundle which was not big enough for her usage			1
as a gesture of goodwill , we ’ve recalculated her bill with the most appropriate bundles applied '			0
it is not the first case of this kind for @entity11			0

turn off auto - updating of apps or email retrieval : again this means you wo n't use any data allowance use mobile websites instead of full desktop view : this will save data per page turn off data roaming all together : if you do n't want to use the internet when you 're away when the 43 - year - old returned to the @entity153 , she discovered that her bank account was more than £ 2,000 overdrawn as a result of a direct debit to phone company @entity11 of £ 2,609.31			1

i 'm really not that big a @entity116 fan			0
' i think @entity11 is preying on people who make a mistake while abroad			0
' there is no way this huge bill relates to the actual cost to @entity11			1
‘ you hear of people doing this and you think " stupid person - why did you do that ? " i do feel foolish			0
