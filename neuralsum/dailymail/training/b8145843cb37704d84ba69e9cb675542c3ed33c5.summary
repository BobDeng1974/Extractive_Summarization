one of the only @entity1 's gazelles in the @entity2 has been hand - reared by zoo keepers after it was rejected by its mother			1
@entity6 - also known as @entity7 - was born at @entity9 ’s @entity8 and workers were forced to take him home with them for round - the - clock care			2
the @entity1 's gazelle was born as part of an exciting breeding programme run by the @entity15 , but was rejected by his mother not long after the birth			1
despite initially looking as if she was properly caring for her firstborn fawn , it was soon clear that the newborn gazelle 's mother was unable to produce any milk for her young			1
zookeepers were forced to step in and provide around the clock feeding for the fawn			0
‘ initially , he needed quite a lot of attention and feeding around the clock , so it was more practical just to take him home for the first few days , ’ senior keeper @entity27 said			0
once he was feeding and taking his milk well , the decision was made to return young @entity7 to the zoo			2
still a baby ! @entity7 the @entity1 gazelle at one - week old , where zookeepers were feeding him around the clock doing much better : senior keeper @entity27 is pictured here feeding the young gazelle zookeepers were quick to re-integrate him with his fellow @entity44 's gazelles - especially considering he is only one of four @entity1 's gazelles currently in the @entity2			1
‘ he ’s a bit more of a handful now , which is good - because that ’s what we want to see			0
it ’s a good indication that he ’s feeding well and obviously he ’s becoming stronger , ’ mr @entity27 said			0
despite being touch - and - go for a while , @entity7 pulled through and is now doing well .			0
