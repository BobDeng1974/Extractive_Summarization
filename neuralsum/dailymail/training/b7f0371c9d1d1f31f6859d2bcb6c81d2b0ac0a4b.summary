the @entity0 had to be ‘ pushed ’ out of the way of space debris earlier this week to prevent a potential impact			1
the piece of debris was thought to be a remnant of a @entity8 spy satellite and may have been a lens cap or a cover			1
the ‘ push ’ was performed by @entity12 ’s atv - 5 cargo ship and pushed the @entity0 about one mile ( 1.6km ) higher			1
@entity15 mission controllers in @entity16 have moved the @entity0 ( shown ) using the @entity12 atv - 5 cargo spacecraft ( seen at the bottom middle of the picture ) to avoid a collision			1
they increased the speed of the station by 16ft ( 5 meters ) per second			1
this raised the height of the station by one mile ( 1.6km ) the debris was due to come within seven - tenths of a mile to the station , which @entity15 mission controllers in @entity16 felt was too close for comfort			1
to move the station they fired the thrusters on the @entity32 - 5 ( @entity32 )			2
this increased the speed of the station ever so slightly and raised it into a higher orbit , out of the orbital path of the debris			1
according to @entity36 , this debris came from a @entity8 spy satellite called @entity38 and was possibly a lens cap or cover			1
the piece of debris was thought to originate from a @entity8 spy satellite launched in november 2011 called @entity38			1
while the exact purposes of the satellite are unknown , @entity8 media often assert they are used for scientific experiments			2
in the @entity48 its believed they are based on a satellite platorm called @entity51 - 2 that is used for military purposes , according to @entity36			2
the debris was catalogued as # 39372/2011 - 066g			0
while this may seem unintersting , the number at the end - 2011 - reveals that the piece of debris was shed by the satellite early in its life			2
this means it is something that it discarded soon after reaching orbit - and as it is a satellite with a camera ability , this might well have been a lens cap or cover			1
moving the station - known as a @entity69 ( @entity70 ) - is not entirely uncommon			0
there are hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris in orbit around @entity75 at pose a threat to the station			0
most of this comes from a @entity8 anti-satellite missile test in 2007 , when the country blew up one of its weather satellites on purpose			0
the incident was widely criticised and has resulted in a dangerous amount of debris orbiting @entity75			0
another infamous debris incident occurred when the @entity89 @entity88 satellite accidentally collided with the @entity91 @entity90 in 2009			0
this too released a large amount of debris into @entity75 orbit			0
there are a number of organisations that track junk that is orbiting @entity75			0
if the chance of a piece hitting the station is one in 100,000 , @entity15 issues a ‘ yellow warning ’			2
this means the station needs to be moved , as happened recently , unless the move could affect the mission			2
moving the station - known as a @entity107 ( @entity107 ) - is not entirely @entity108 are hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris in orbit around @entity75 ( illustration shown ) that pose a threat to the station , so it must occasionally be moved even when a collision is rated as a possible risk this picture shows just how damaging space debris can be			1
it was taken on a @entity121 servicing mission to @entity15 's @entity123 satellite in 1984			1
the hole could have been caused by a piece of space debris that was no bigger than a pea if the chance of a collision is one in 10,000 @entity15 issues a ‘ red warning ’ , which means the station must be moved regardless of whether it could hamper the mission			1
and in very rare circumstances when a collision seems likely , the crew must prepare for an emergency evacuation			0
in march 2009 such an incident occurred , and the three astronauts on the station had to take cover in one of the @entity142 modules , which act as ‘ lifeboats ’			0
had the station been hit , they would have had to detach and return to @entity75			0
however the latest boost had an added bonus , as a pre-planned boost scheduled for a few weeks from now no longer needs to be completed			0
' the @entity70 was completed nominally , and the @entity0 is back in a nominal @entity147 ( @entity147 ) , ” said an @entity0 status update			0
' since the @entity70 was executed , the reboost that was planned for later is no longer required , and will not be performed			0

@entity15 mission controllers in @entity16 have moved the @entity0 to avoid a collision
they increased the speed of the station by 16ft ( 5 meters ) per second
this raised the height of the station by one mile ( 1.6km ) and allowed it to *dodge* a piece of *incoming* debris
it 's thought the debris was a lens cap from the @entity8 *yaogan* - 12 satellite
a @entity12 cargo spacecraft was used to move the @entity0
if debris hit the station it could spell *disaster* and *destroy* it
@entity0 has been moved many times before to avoid collisions with debris
