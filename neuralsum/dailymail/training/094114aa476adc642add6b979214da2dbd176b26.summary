dangerous teeth - whitening products are being sold to unsuspecting customers on the internet			1
the scale of the problem was laid bare last night when @entity7 officers revealed they seized illegal whitening kits worth more than £ 500,000 from a house in @entity10			1
the medical - grade treatments are being sold with nearly 60 times the legal level of bleaching agent hydrogen peroxide			1
the illegal gels , which promise to whiten teeth in just seven days , are being marketed as a cheap alternative to professional whitening services			0
however , dentists say they can lead to mouth blisters and irritated , extremely sensitive gums			0
@entity7 officers in @entity22 , west @entity10 have seized 12,000 teeth - whitening kits worth in excess of £ 500,000 amid fears the products could cause painful blisters to the mouth and gums because of high levels of hydrogen peroxide teeth - whitening has become increasingly popular as more @entity33 seek the @entity35 smile sported by celebrities			1
but with professional whitening costing up to £ 700 , some are tempted by cheaper kits offered online			2
as a result , fraudsters have moved in on the business – with some selling pirated kits turned out in overseas factories using substandard and even risky ingredients			0
the latest batch of seized products , found in a house in @entity22 , @entity10 , contained 5.9 per cent hydrogen peroxide , meaning they could only be legally supplied to dental practitioners			1
without the proper medical training , a higher dosage of hydrogen peroxide than is safe can easily end up being applied and lead to teeth and gum damage			1
according to @entity59 law , teeth - whitening products are only safe to be sold directly to customers if they contain a maximum of 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide			1
@entity63 @entity62 has now issued a court order for the 12,000 seized kits to be destroyed			2
@entity66 said they belonged to a @entity68 national called @entity69 , who has since fled the country			0
a spokesman said : ' @entity7 officers uncovered evidence that the goods were being supplied online to consumers with inadequate checks being made			1
mr @entity69 has returned to @entity68 and stated that he was merely an agent for an @entity78 company , so it was decided to seek forfeiture of the products worth in excess of £ 500,000			0
' @entity83 indicate that some of the products , which go by the branding @entity86 , were still being sold online last night			2
according to one website : ' you do not have to spend hundreds for professional teeth whitening			0
' @entity22 councillor @entity92 said : ' products like this should only be used under the supervision of a qualified dental practitioner			2
the kits were seized from a residential property in @entity99 , near @entity100			2
experts warn the strong bleaching gels , which are 5.9 per cent hydrogen peroxide , should only be handled by a dental practitioner ( file image ) ' we always put our residents first and our trading standards team work hard to identify and seize dangerous products , and prosecute when possible			1
' last month the @entity111 secured its first prosecution of someone illegally training others to carry out teeth - whitening			0
@entity116 , a beauty trainer from @entity117 , was fined £ 11,490 for illegally training beauticians in the service			0
only dentists are permitted to carry out teeth - whitening in @entity33			0
@entity121 , professor of restorative dentistry at the @entity122 , said that hydrogen peroxide is dangerous if not applied by a medical professional			1
' if a dentist does not regulate their use , there is a risk of harm , ' he said			0
' there is a further risk that unregulated products used by individuals without professional supervision may be more caustic and / or toxic and potentially cause severe and dangerous injuries			0

@entity7 officers seized 12,000 kits from a home in @entity10
the products were found to be 5.9 per cent hydrogen peroxide and should have only been supplied directly to dental practitioners
