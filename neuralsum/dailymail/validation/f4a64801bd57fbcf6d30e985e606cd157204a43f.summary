@entity1 manager @entity0 says @entity2 will be serious contenders to win the @entity4 in @entity5 next summer			1
@entity8 's side beat @entity9 with ease on friday night to keep up their 100 per cent record at the top of @entity14 and are six points clear of nearest rivals @entity17 at the halfway point in qualification			1
@entity2 have been beaten by @entity20 at the last two major tournaments but @entity0 , who has worked in @entity22 for the past two seasons , insists @entity25 players are not inferior			1
@entity26 celebrates after scoring against @entity9 in the @entity28 qualifier at @entity29 on friday @entity8 watches on as his side made it five wins from five in @entity14 ' i can see from outside that you have enough quality and enough potential to do well , ' the former @entity34 and @entity35 boss was quoted as saying in the @entity41			1
' i am convinced you can do well			0
@entity2 will be contenders at @entity28 because of the level of the players			2
' @entity2 have very good players â€“ a lot of them could play in @entity22 it is just about finding a way that they can stick together			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 ( right ) thinks @entity2 will be contenders to win @entity49 2016 in @entity5 @entity0 spent six years managing @entity34 ( above ) and had a short spell in charge of @entity35 ' the understanding between them can be much better			1
but if you talk about potential , if you talk about quality , you have enough quality in @entity2			0

for me it is cyclical - they will be there next year , ' he said			0
' some @entity64 clubs are getting stronger , like @entity73 and @entity74 , but the @entity61 will be also stronger in the years to come			2
@entity2 were beaten by @entity20 at the @entity75 last summer thanks to a @entity77 header @entity2 were also knocked out of @entity78 by the @entity67 on penalties ' the @entity67 clubs know how to compete , that is the reason why they progress in @entity64 this year			1
they are quite aware of the tactics			0
they work together with different tactics and different systems so they know what to do			0
' but i do n't see @entity2 or the @entity25 players worse than them technically			2
' physically and technically they are at the same level			0
tactically , obviously , the advantage of @entity20 is that they have been for years doing a tactical game			0
