by @entity0 it may have traditionalists spluttering into their drams			0
but a @entity5 supermarket chain is offering @entity7 cut - price kilts and a set of bagpipes for less than £ 33			1
the poly viscose kilt retails at a penny under £ 20 , while the bagpipes are only £ 12.99			1
those who want to add a polyester ghillie shirt can do so for £ 12.99 – along with a no - frills leather sporran and chain at £ 9.99 and socks for £ 3.99			1
@entity18 : @entity5 supermarket chain @entity19 is offering @entity7 cut - price kilts and a set of bagpipes for less than £ 33 in the run up to the @entity22 the £ 46.96 @entity24 outfit will go on sale in all @entity19 stores in @entity7 in the run - up to the start of the @entity22 on july 23			1
three tartans are on offer – @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 – and they are the cheapest kilts ever to go on sale			2
the kilt has a 24in drop and , unravelled , measures five yards – three yards short of traditional specifications			0
music to your ears ? traditional bagpipes start at £ 1,200 , whereas this @entity19 version of the instrument is on sale for just £ 12.99 @entity46 uses only traditional handwoven material – and owner @entity48 is in no doubt he would lose customers quickly if he introduced poly viscose versions manufactured in the @entity52			1
yesterday , we took the @entity19 kilt to mr @entity48 ’s shop in @entity57 city centre for his expert verdict			1
he said : ‘ you get what you pay for			0
this is a £ 20 kilt and it is worth that			0
it is not a bad kilt			0
' i ’m not going to criticise shops that would sell them as they bring in a lot of money for the country from tourists , but our shop would lose customers			0
‘ they are very popular with stag weekenders who buy them for trips abroad			0
they can also be put in the washing machine , which is not a bad thing after a stag weekend			0
‘ but we would n’t be able to even buy the material for £ 20			0
you can see the difference immediately when you see a poly viscose kilt beside a traditional one			1
‘ they look and feel completely different and most @entity7 would rather have a traditional one , despite our standard @entity31 kilt starting off at £ 350			1
‘ you get what you pay for – and the vast majority of @entity7 would rather pay the extra knowing they will have a kilt for life			2
’ but @entity7 kiltmakers are not impressed , claiming cheap and cheerful kilts produced overseas from man - made fibres are affecting their trade			2
@entity101 , a governor of the @entity102 and owner of @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , said : ‘ a lot of imported stuff is from places such as @entity110 and @entity111			0
‘ however , the majority of folk want to buy something that is high quality and will last a lifetime			0
the problem is that when someone goes online and sees a kilt for sale at £ 20 and then a real one at £ 300 , they just assume a kilt is a kilt and go for the cheaper one			1
‘ kilts are symbolic of @entity7 , but tourists are probably unaware they are buying a garment made in the @entity52 which is not @entity7			0
’ @entity19 spokesman @entity126 was unable to confirm in which country its kilts were manufactured , but said the supplier was a @entity7 firm			2
he added : ‘ this fantastic range at unbelievably low prices will allow the people of @entity7 to not only showcase @entity7 ’s proud heritage and traditions , but will give everyone the chance to really get behind @entity138			0
‘ traditionally , @entity24 wear can be quite expensive , which prevents a lot of people from purchasing it , so it ’s great to be able to offer everyone in @entity7 the chance to buy a kilt for under £ 20			2
’ standard traditional kilts retail for around £ 350 and are made from wool			2
a @entity151 shirt is about £ 65 , a sporran can cost £ 300 and a top - of - the - range dress kilt can be as much as £ 700			1
traditional bagpipes start at £ 1,200			1
also for sale as part of the @entity7 at @entity19 range are junior ‘ playable ’ bagpipes in @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity159 tartan for £ 12.99 , along with a tartan hip flask at £ 6.99			1
ladies can buy @entity32 mini-kilts for only £ 16.99			0
showcase : @entity19 says the cut - price kilts will showcase @entity7 's proud heritage and traditions , and help people get behind @entity138 during the @entity168			1

@entity5 chain offers cut - price kilts *ahead* of 2012 @entity168
poly viscose kilt retails at £ 19.99 , while bagpipes are only £ 12.99
ghillie shirt can be added to the look for £ 12.00 , and a sporran at £ 9.99
@entity180 will go on sale at all @entity19 stores in @entity7 before @entity57 games
but kilt experts say @entity19 version will put shoppers off traditional tartans
a traditional wool kilt will retail for around £ 300 , and bagpipes cost £ 1,200
