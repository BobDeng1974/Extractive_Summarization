the brightly - lit signs also instructed drivers to move from the inside lane to the middle lane in order to avoid the accident - which @entity7 also allegedly ignored			1

' mr @entity7 did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead			1
we know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say mr @entity7 caused ' @entity45 , prosecuting ‘ along that stretch of road on that day there had been another incident , i believe it was some sort of minor accident but it had caused a build up in the @entity11 itself			1
‘ because of that incident the relevant gantries were being displayed to both control the speed of traffic and to warn traffic of the problem ahead			2
‘ there was a 40mph speed limit being shown to traffic and the gantries were showing that a lane ahead was closed and for traffic to move from lane one to lane two when safe to do so			2
‘ mr @entity7 did not take any action as a result of the gantry signs warning him of what was up ahead			1
we know the young girl died and the cause of death was the collision which the prosecution say mr @entity7 caused			1

‘ i looked up in my inside mirror and then i heard a screeching from behind			0
i saw a lorry coming up very quickly behind me in lane two			0
' i could see a bead of blood on her forehead and her eyes were partly open			0
she appeared to have no soul left in her ' @entity150 , father of @entity19 ‘ i knew i needed to get away from it so i steered to the left to get away from the lorry			0
within seconds of seeing this lorry it hit our car from behind pushing our car off the road into the barrier			0
