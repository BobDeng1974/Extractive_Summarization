by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 20:23 est , 20 march 2012 @entity2 foreign minister @entity1 is facing calls to resign after appearing to use the fatal shootings of three @entity6 schoolchildren in @entity7 to criticise @entity9 policy in @entity10			1
in a speech on @entity15 affairs in @entity16 , the @entity12 @entity2 official suggested that the shootings outside a @entity6 school in @entity19 were the same as the deaths of children inadvertently killed in @entity9 attacks on @entity15 militants			1
@entity1 also seemingly compared the deaths in @entity10 to the slaughter of innocents in @entity28 , the rampage by a gunman in @entity31 last year in which dozens of teenagers were killed and the bus crash in @entity35 that killed 22 @entity37 schoolchildren a week ago			0
@entity2 foreign policy chief @entity1 , pictured here on monday with prime minister of the @entity42 @entity41 , is under fire after likening the @entity19 school shooting to troubles in @entity10 suffered by @entity15 children coffins of the dead lie in shrouds			1
prime minister @entity50 said in a statement that he was incensed by @entity1 's comments about the tragedy she said : ‘ when we remember young people who have been killed in all sorts of terrible circumstances – the @entity37 children having lost their lives in a terrible tragedy and when we think of what happened in @entity19 , when we remember what happened in @entity31 a year ago , when we know what is happening in @entity28 , when we see what is happening in @entity10 and in different parts of the world – we remember young people and children who lose their lives			2
’ the @entity9 government demanded that @entity1 step down , with defence minister @entity72 denouncing the mention of @entity10 as inappropriate and demanding a retraction			0
he said : ‘ the comparison made by @entity1 between what is happening in @entity10 to what happened in @entity19 , and what is going on in @entity28 every day , is outrageous and has absolutely no grounding in reality			0
’ @entity9 ’s interior minister @entity81 said @entity1 ’s statement ‘ further harms the ability of the @entity2 to be an honest broker ’ in the @entity84 , adding : ‘ she can no longer serve in her position			1
’ tragic : rabbi @entity88 , 30 , the jewish studies teacher shot dead along with his sons ( left ) and @entity91 , ( right ) the eight - year - old daughter of the school 's headteacher , who also died he was joined in his calls for a retraction by @entity97 , @entity9 ’s foreign affairs minister			1
a spokesman for @entity1 , who was a surprise appointment to the new post of @entity101 for foreign affairs in 2009 , claimed the remarks had been grossly distorted			0
‘ in her remarks , the @entity101 referred to tragedies taking the lives of children around the world and drew no parallel whatsoever between the circumstances of the @entity19 attack and the situation in @entity10 , ’ he said			1
but that explanation was not accepted by @entity9 ’s prime minister @entity50 , who said she wrongly sought to draw a parallel between the calculated murder of children and @entity15 casualties who have died in attacks on adult terrorists in @entity10			0
too young : @entity122 ( left ) who was killed alongside his father and brother @entity123 ( right ) ‘ what especially outrages me is the comparison between a targeted massacre of children and the surgical defensive actions of the @entity130 [ @entity130 ] , intended to strike at terrorists using children as human shields , ’ he said			2
@entity135 mp @entity134 , vice-chairman of the @entity136 , said : ‘ it is entirely inappropriate for her to make a comparison between events in @entity7 and @entity10 when she is speaking as the @entity2 ’s foreign minister			1
she needs to think again			0
’ @entity142 launched a lukewarm defence of @entity1			0
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ i ’m not entirely sure that was the comparison she was making			0
’ he said @entity1 ’s team ‘ feel her remarks were taken out of context ’ .			2
