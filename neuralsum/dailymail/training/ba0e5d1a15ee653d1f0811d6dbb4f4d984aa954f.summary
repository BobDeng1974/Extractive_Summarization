by @entity0 it ’s normally competitors , not spectators , who put themselves in danger at extreme sport events			0
however , this was n’t the case at the @entity9 @entity8 in @entity10 on saturday , where one man was lucky to escape without life - threatening injuries after taking a brutal fall riding an injured cyclist ’s bike downhill			1
pro rider @entity17 was involved in a severe crash during the event which left him with a broken leg and in need of hospital treatment			2
disaster : @entity17 's friend decided to ride the competitor 's bike down the track instead of wheeling it away at the @entity9 world championship event in @entity10 a member of the crowd - who has not been identified - offered to look after his bike while he was being treated			1
but he was unable to resist trying out the track himself - and then suffered a brutal fall as he was traversing a difficult part of the track known as the ‘ whoops ’			0
' i only met him after my crash as he offered to take my bike down the hill for me , ' mr @entity17 said			0
' i think he 's ok though he was in my ambulance on a spine board and was pretty k'od but that 's all i know i 'm going to pop down to hospital tomorrow and see how he 's doing , ' mr @entity17 told online biking magazine @entity46			2
professional downhill mountain biker @entity47 posted to @entity49 on sunday that he spoke with the injured spectator , who is recovering in hospital with two broken vertebrae and a dislocated shoulder			1
heavy rain took its toll on the tropical far north @entity56 track , with some parts of the mountain bike course being turned into mud			2
@entity60 have confirmed that a 28 - year - old man transported to @entity62 on saturday afternoon is in a stable condition			0
slow - and - steady : a spectator , riding @entity17 's bike , rounds a corner nearing the ' whomps ' at the @entity68 in @entity10 easy does it : the spectator slips , taking the bike on a tumble with him			1
lying in pain : after taking a fall , and being hit with his own bike , the man is left waiting in pain for paramedics to arrive .			0
