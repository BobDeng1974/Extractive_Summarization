by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 04:59 est , 24 may 2013 the remote volcanic islands of the @entity3 archipelago - home to the world 's largest tortoises and the place that inspired @entity8 's theory of evolution - is coming to @entity11 's @entity10 later this year			1
@entity11 , in partnership with @entity13 ( @entity14 ) and the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , sent hikers to the @entity3 with @entity18 equipment to take panoramic images of its wildlife			1
the hikers captured thousands of images using the football - like cameras mounted on a tower on top of the 42lb ( 19kg ) computer backpacks			1
a giant tortoise crawls along a path in @entity30 , a tortoise breeding centre on the @entity3			2
googler @entity31 is seen in the background taking photos using the @entity18 orb camera attached to a backpack			1
the volcanic islands of the @entity3 archipelago are closed to tourists but @entity11 recently sent its @entity10 and underwater cameras to the region and is putting the images online later this year as well as taking land images with its @entity45 backpack cameras , @entity11 also took underwater cameras to the @entity3 to record life on the seabed			1
in this photo from the @entity51 , @entity49 uses an @entity53 camera to capture images of an @entity55 during a survey dive the @entity3 , also known as the @entity3 and @entity57 are an archipelago of volcanic islands found on either side of the @entity61 in the @entity62			2
@entity63 means group of islands or island chain			2
the @entity3 islands are 500 miles west of @entity68			0
they are famous for their giant tortosies and blue - footed booby birds			1
the first chart of the islands was said to be made by the buccaneer @entity76 in 1684			0
the first detailed studies of the islands were made by @entity8 while aboard @entity79 during the 1830s			0
he used the animals and landscapes he saw to help develop his theory of evolution			0
they also used underwater @entity10 cameras to capture sea life as part of the @entity51			1
@entity11 is now stitching these images together and all of the panoramic images will be available on @entity92 later this year so people around the world can experience this remote archipelago			1
few have explored the remote volcanic islands of the @entity3 archipelago because it is closed to tourists			2
@entity11 was allowed on the islands with its backpack @entity45 orb cameras to fully document the archipelago in pictures			1
each @entity45 orb has 15 cameras inside it that have captured panoramic views of some of the most inaccessible places on the @entity3			1
crews from the @entity51 worked with @entity11 to capture 360 - degree views of selected underwater areas too			2
in this photo from the @entity51 , @entity49 uses his @entity53 camera to swim through and photograph a large group of sea lions during a survey dive at @entity120 in @entity3 @entity121 , the project 's leader for @entity92 said : ' we spent 10 days there hiking over trails and even down the crater of an active volcano			1
' ' and these are islands , so half of the life there is under the water surface			0
we brought @entity10 underwater to swim with sea lions , sharks and other marine animals			1
' @entity11 is processing the footage and is trying to stitch it together			0
it hopes to post it to @entity10 later this year			2
@entity140 of the @entity13 collects seashore imagery with the @entity18 at the @entity143 wetland area on @entity144 in the @entity3			0
the orbs attached to the @entity45 backpacks have 15 cameras inside that can take panoramic photos			2
the backpack weighs 42lb ( 19kg ) the @entity152 backpacks , took more than a year to develop			0
the 40lb backpack holds up a number of 15 - megapixel cameras , an on - board hard drive , and enough battery to run for an entire day			1
cameras are positioned to give a 360 degree view so every possible angle is captured			0
the cameras captured the nesting sites of blue - footed boobies , the red - throated ' magnificent frigatebirds , ' swimming hammerhead sharks and , of course , the island 's giant tortoises			1
scientists working with @entity11 are exploring the footage for other species and hope to update the pictures regularly throughout the years as they study the effects of invasive species , tourism and climate change on the island 's ecosystems			0
' we hope that children in classrooms around the world will be trying to discover what they can see in the images , even tiny creatures like insects , ' said @entity140 , a scientist with the @entity13			0
' we can use this as an education experience for children , and there is a huge opportunity for rare discoveries			0
' @entity140 of the @entity13 climbs out of an @entity144 island where he was collecting imagery on the @entity3			0
the lava landscapes found on the island help tell the story of the formation of the @entity3			0
tourists are banned from the islands and the images taken by @entity11 , due to go online later this year , will give people worldwide a unique view and unseen places @entity205 and others supervised the @entity11 trekkers and helped guide them to remote areas either off - limits to tourists or rarely visited because they are hard to reach			1
they also captured images of the areas frequented by tourists so they can keep track of how this access is affecting the environment			2
since launching @entity10 in 2007 , @entity11 has expanded from urban neighborhoods accessed easily by its mapping cars to more hard - to - access sites like the ocean floor , the @entity225 rain forest and the @entity226			1
' this whole project was part of @entity11 's ongoing effort to build the most comprehensive and accurate map of the world , ' @entity227 said			0
@entity140 is shown crossing a field of ferns to reach some naturally occurring sulfur mines on the top of @entity237 , an active volcano on @entity144 in the @entity3			0
the @entity92 team traveled for over hours , hiking and on horseback , to reach this remote location			0

hikers spent 10 days on the islands capturing panoramic images using backpack orb cameras weighing 42lbs and underwater @entity10 equipment
the cameras caught rare images of giant tortoises , blue - footed boobies and sea lions on the islands where tourists are banned
