but an @entity6 retailer has launched the ultimate snack for those with a sssweet tooth			1
manufacturers @entity10 claim that this 27lb monster - known as the ' gummy party python ' will kill you if you attempt to eat it in one sitting			1
and at a staggering 36,000 calories per snake - or nearly 18 - and - a - half times an adult 's recommended daily calorie intake - it 's hardly surprising that you 'll get more than a sugar rush if you choose to part with the $ 150 price tag			1
@entity10 's website says : ' actually , you probably could n't ingest 26lbs of candy , if you did your stomach would probably burst			1
' slithering in at almost eight feet long , this slippery snack is described as ' as ridiculous as candy can get '			0
the giant sweet contains 27lb of sugar - more than a dozen bags of sugar - but makers of the candy say that it can be kept for up to a year as long as it is kept out of direct sunlight and extreme heat			0
it 's recommends that the treat is to be shared , or eaten alone in 306 separate sugary servings			1
the hand - made treat comes in two flavours , either blue raspberry with green apple or red cherry			2
generously described as the @entity44 of the sweet world , the gummy party python has proved a hit already , with the website currently out of stock			0
manufacturers claim that it has lifelike details including including intricate eyes , blended colouring , ridged coils , and thousands of individually carved scales			0
@entity10 appears to be no stranger to producing oversized candy - the company also produces the world 's largest gummy bear , which at 5lb is the equivalent of 1,400 regular bears and the largest gummy worm , which is a whopping 4,000 calories			1
the company also produces a giant gummy cola bottle which is 90 times the size of a regular sweet			0
the snake is not the biggest sweet treat ever produced			2
a 9,702lb chocolate bar was put on display in the @entity72 capital @entity73 back in 2010			0

@entity6 retailer @entity10 are selling the huge snack for $ 150 *online*
the snake contains a staggering 12lbs of sugar
