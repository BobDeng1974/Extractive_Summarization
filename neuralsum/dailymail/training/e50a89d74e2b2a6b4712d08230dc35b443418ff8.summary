@entity0 may tire of the fascination with his work with beetroot , but his personal journey from the factory where he screwed lids on jars to playing for @entity8 at the @entity9 will inspire a generation of rejected footballers to fight back			1
he is the 21st - century standard - bearer for the rise from part - time football to the very top of the professional game			2
this season , at @entity17 , he will venture into the @entity19 as others try to emulate his progress			1
among them are three @entity24 strikers who , like @entity0 , arrive in the @entity25 via promotion , rather than because top - flight clubs took a chance on some of the unsung talent in the lower leagues			1
‘ what @entity0 has done has been incredible , ’ said @entity48 ’s @entity31 , a 25 - year - old who has met each challenge since @entity50 paid £ 50,000 to @entity51 in 2009 for the bricklayer			1
‘ i ’ve taken it well so far and hopefully i can take my chance in the @entity25			1
there ’s a lot more to it than scoring goals but it helps massively and if you ’ve got that natural instinct then you ’re on to a winner			2
‘ it is hard not to look back five years , when i was training for @entity51 on a tuesday and thursday , and not pinch myself but my family keep my feet on the ground and remind me of what it was like beforehand			2
’ role model : @entity0 has followed a similar route to play for @entity72 team @entity17 @entity73 was the @entity50 manager who took a chance on the young striker who had been released by @entity76 and hopped from @entity77 @entity48 to @entity78 before joining @entity51 in the @entity79 , the ninth tier of @entity24 football			1
‘ i remember it well , ’ said @entity73			1
‘ it was teeming down with rain and i could have gone home after half an hour			2
i liked what i saw			0
he was always in the right areas at the right time			0
he was brave , flinging himself at the ball , putting defenders under pressure			0
he was quite raw but you could see there was something to work on			0
more than that , he just had a natural instinct and was a massive threat			0
@entity97 had been looking closely , but they were struggling financially at the time , so we went in and did a deal			0
’ @entity31 was 20 at the time			1
he scored the winner at @entity101 on his first start in november 2009 , the winner against @entity104 three days later and the winner against @entity106 on his next appearance			0
by the end of the season he had 20 goals and @entity50 were at @entity111 in the play - off final , which they lost to @entity114			1
@entity31 will turn out for @entity48 after spells at @entity51 , @entity50 and @entity116 sharp shooter : @entity31 has had a prolific record throughout his career @entity120 : @entity121 took a chance by signing @entity31 for @entity50 ‘ he was never fazed by it , ’ said @entity73			1
‘ he uses his body well and is never looking for the perfect goal			0
he ’s happy to finish early , which surprises defenders and goalkeepers			0
‘ there ’s no reason at all why he ca n’t keep doing it in the @entity25			2
if he thinks the opportunity is there , he ’ll try to score			0
’ @entity116 bought @entity134 for £ 1million , then sold him to @entity48 for £ 4.5m last year and @entity36 stepped into the void , forging a prolific partnership with @entity137			1
@entity36 was released by @entity138 as a teenager and picked up by @entity97 , who gave him a three - month contract and sent him on loan to @entity143 in the @entity144 ( tier six )			1
@entity97 boss @entity145 was impressed by his development , rewarding @entity36 with a longer deal and returning to sign him for £ 1m when he moved to @entity116 and earned an @entity8 under 21 call - up			1
he was last season ’s @entity149			2
@entity34 ’s journey is equally startling			2
released by @entity152 , he worked in factories and played for £ 30 a game for @entity155 , helping them climb into the @entity157 ( tier seven )			1
mvp : @entity36 was voted last season 's @entity149 after arriving from @entity160 come along : @entity116 manager @entity145 brought @entity36 with him when he moved from @entity97 while there , he was convicted of assault after a pub fight and played wearing an electronic tag , dashing home after games to comply with a 6pm curfew			1
‘ i ’m not proud of what happened but it happened , ’ said @entity34			2
‘ i ’ve turned my life round			0
’ @entity172 manager @entity171 refused to listen to those warning him to keep away from @entity34 and nagged his chairman to pay £ 15,000 to sign him			1
‘ it was a big gamble for us , ’ said @entity171			0
‘ he turned up for training and we were running around a track and he did n’t have the right running shoes			0
he did n’t look like a footballer but as soon as they saw him play , everyone knew he was special			0
he had unbelievable pace off the mark , he could play either side , chased back and worked so hard			0
he never caused me any trouble and was popular in the dressing - room			0
’ in little more than a year , @entity172 had won the @entity189 and sold @entity34 to @entity190 in a deal which would be worth more than £ 500,000 once the @entity193 club had banked their share of the sell - on from his £ 1m transfer to @entity196 in 2012			1
‘ i always thought he was good enough to play in the @entity149 , but he had to make the step to @entity190 , where he took the @entity144 by storm , ’ said @entity171			1
@entity199 in the box : @entity34 was signed by @entity196 for £ 1m after playing for @entity172 and @entity190 stat 's impressive ! @entity34 scored 34 goals in 40 games for lower league @entity190 @entity34 scored 34 in 40 games as @entity190 were promoted to the @entity204 as champions			1
‘ there ’s no reason why he ca n’t do it in the @entity25			2
he ’s got the desire and the pace			0
he ’s still new to full - time training , so he ’s improving			0
i ’m pleased it ’s worked out for him			0
’ at 27 , @entity34 is the eldest of the trio , but @entity0 was 30 on his @entity25 debut and a year older when winning his first cap			1
the precedent is set for three englishmen born to score as they embark on the biggest season of their lives			0
it is about attitude and desire			0
it is about seizing the chance			2
