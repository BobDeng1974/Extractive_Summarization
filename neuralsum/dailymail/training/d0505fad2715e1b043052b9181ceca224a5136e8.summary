in a galaxy not so far away , a @entity1 inventor has created a replica of @entity5 ’s famous spaceship , the @entity6			1
the amazing contraption is seen hovering and flying around the ground , complete with the aesthetics and lights inspired by the famous @entity12 ship			1
it is built around a standard quadcopter drone , which has been boosted to give the @entity6 drone more speed			1
the @entity6 drone is seen taking off and flying around			1
it has lights on the back to mimic famous spaceship			1
and it also has a shell and design that matches the original			2
the drone itself cost about £ 750 , but the modifications were under £ 20 @entity31 , 40 , who goes by @entity32 on @entity33 and is from @entity34 in @entity1 , said that he ‘ overpowered ’ the quadcopter drone to make it ‘ easily capable of 90 km / h ( 55mph ) speed ’			1
rumours suggest that the @entity40 - based firm is looking to release a range of multirotor helicopters late in 2015			0
the devices would be fitted with @entity45 cameras , controlled remotely and are expected to retail for between $ 500 ( £ 317 ) and $ 1,000 ( £ 634 )			0
at this price range , the drones would be targeted more towards consumers and hobbyists and compete with market leaders @entity51 and @entity52 , rather than rival the likes of professional devices from @entity55			0
he added : ‘ but with this extra hull it becomes a slow flying pig			0
‘ top speed is probably around 30 km / h ( 19mph ) , if i try to go faster with more angle it ’s making a cool backflip			0
’ he joked that it could make the ‘ @entity6 ’ in several thousand years , in reference to @entity5 ’s boasting in @entity12 : a @entity66 , when he said the @entity6 could make the ‘ @entity6 ’ - a smuggling route - in ‘ less than twelve parsecs ’			2
@entity32 said it cost him next to nothing to modify the drone into a new shape			2
it cost £ 7.50 ( $ 11.50 ) for the two foam planks to make the drone , and £ 9 ( $ 13.80 ) for the front and rear lights			1

of course , the quadcopter itself and the radio set him back about £ 750 ( $ 1,150 ) , though he used acrylic paint for the body of the spacecraft , and glue to hold it all together			2

he used a drone known as the @entity96 , with a custom frame made of carbon and aluminium			0
the battery usually lasts about eight minutes , but with the added weight of the @entity102 it lasted only about five minutes			0
next up , @entity32 said he was planning to work on a drone version of a @entity104			0
he used a drone known as the @entity96 , with a custom frame made of carbon and aluminium			0
the battery usually lasts about eight minutes , but with the added weight of the @entity6 shell it lasted only about five minutes mr @entity31 also showed off his creation above a snowy field in @entity34 ( pictured ) , at the foot of the @entity114 , making it look somewhat like ' @entity116 ' from @entity12 the video shows the replica @entity6 drone zipping around the field at a height of around 20 feet and the rear of the ship is light up just as it is in the films mr @entity31 built the @entity6 using different parts bought from various manufacture as well as parts he made by hand			1
but , aside from the drone , he built the entire thing from scratch			0
