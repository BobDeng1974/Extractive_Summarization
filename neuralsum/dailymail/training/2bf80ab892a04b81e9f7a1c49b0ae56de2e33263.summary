by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:32 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 20:06 est , 14 july 2013 @entity3 fashion photographer @entity2 has pictured some of the world 's most beautiful women for @entity8 covers and style spreads			1
while those shoots are often all about beauty and clothes , now he is giving an insight into his own mind with a new exhibition at @entity17 's @entity16 showcasing his more creative - and some what darker - side			1
his collection of technicoloured dream - like scenes of women contrast beauty with tragedy and drama , such as a smashed objects , silent screaming and implicit violence			2
@entity30 smiles # 8 : @entity2 photographs @entity31 in dramatic lighting , constrasting her beauty with the blank expression on her face ' actress # 6 ' : within the technicoloured perfect world is inserted a disturbing glimpse of extreme emotion the works , some of which have never been seen before , will be on display at @entity17 's @entity16 this summer			1
' @entity44 ' is a major retrospective of @entity2 's work , to coincide with the publication of the book by the same name			1
women and colour have long been @entity2 ’s twin obsessions , and he has photographed some of the most stunning women in the world , including model - of - the - moment @entity31			1
his work is filled with glamorous , beautiful women posing as dazed housewives and decadent beauties or sunbathing sexpots and ecstatic @entity61			2
' @entity62 ' : combining beauty with explicit sexuality @entity2 pictures a beautiful model fondling herself and sucking an ice lolly however viewers will notice that the colourful world of seemingly perfect women with blank expressions belies a deeper sense of disturbance and neurosis			1
look more closely and there is silent screaming , a head pushed down on a bed , a face covered in polythene , a woman pushing an empty swing			0
the artist revealed the sentiment behind his striking images in an interview with the @entity87 earlier this year			0
he said : ' these women are n't blank because they have nothing to say			2
they are blank because they 're overwhelmed by their world			2
when somebody is thinking , they look blank			0
and it 's that moment that i 'm trying to capture			0
' when somebody looks lost in thought they 're vulnerable , and you 're able to intrude on that privacy and take a photograph that captures this human being using their brain , trying to clarify how they got to this position			0
' why are they at the sink washing up , or in the playground pushing a swing with no child in it ? to me , the great moments in @entity114 are close - ups of a woman 's face , thinking , and she 's just realised that her whole world is wrong			0
' the exhibition has been timed to coincide with the book ' i only want you to @entity121 ' by @entity2 @entity2 ’s influences include film directors such as @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 ; the styled elegance of fashion photographer @entity129 and the psychedelic illustrations of his father , @entity131			1
each image is immaculately crafted , often starting with story - board drawings so that the final image lies somewhere between cinema and photography			0
luscious colours dazzle from every image – blood red ketchup splashes against a black and white floor ; a mouth drips with gold ; egg yolk oozes across a plate			0
@entity2 will also share an in depth and personal view of his 15 years spent in the fashion world in an exhibition running alongside the @entity16 show , called @entity149			1
not drawing a blank : @entity2 at the opening of his exhibition			1
he said he aims to show that women are not vacant but thinking by their expression unhappy ending : @entity2 and his model wife @entity156 at their wedding in 1997 , they are now getting divorced born in @entity17 in 1964 , @entity2 studied illustration at @entity160 , and briefly directed music videos before becoming a fashion photographer in the mid- 90s			1
he has published his work in many influential magazines including @entity165 , @entity8 , @entity166 , the @entity167 and @entity168			0
his work was showcased in @entity169 at the @entity170 in @entity171 in 2009 , and he has works in the permanent collection of the @entity174 , @entity17 and the @entity175 , @entity17			2
he married supermodel @entity176 in a star - studded ceremony 1997 where she was given away by @entity178 with @entity179 as a bridesmaid			0
the couple went on to have two children together but the relationship broke down earlier this year and they are now in the process of getting divorced			0
@entity2 : i only want you to love me is on display at @entity16 until 29 september			1
