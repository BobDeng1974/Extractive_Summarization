company computers were also allegedly used to post anonymous comments on blogs critical of its practices and to delete criticism from its @entity30			1

the @entity7 account was operated in the name of @ @entity38 , but it was closed shortly after a newspaper journalist questioned @entity4 about its provenance			2
no one of that name is thought to work at the company , but an online comment on a blog using the same name was said to be made from an ip address – a unique set of numbers similar to a telephone number that computers use to communicate with one another – based at @entity4 ’s @entity54 offices			1

the company insists it offers a valuable service by helping people access cash quickly until they are paid			2
but critics have accused it of cashing in on the desperation caused by the soaring cost of living and pay freezes			0
a @entity4 spokesman said if they found the employee who posted the offensive comments they would face ‘ serious disciplinary action			0
’ she added : ‘ this is an issue that @entity4 takes extremely seriously , as we are committed to openness and transparency			0
