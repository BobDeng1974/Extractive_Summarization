by @entity0 the dust coughed up by stars during their death throes has always been a mystery to scientists			1
but trying to analyse the behaviour of this interstellar material involves going into deep space - and up until now that has hindered efforts to understand it			2
now researchers at @entity13 have found a way around this problem by designing a machine that can create interstellar dust from scratch here on @entity20			1
a close up image of interstellar dust created by the @entity24 machine			1
this grain is approximately 1.5 micrometers in diameter			0
for comparison , a bacteria cell is around 5 micrometers the device , dubbed @entity24 , could help astronomers better understand the types of grains that form around stars			2
dust grains that form around dying stars and are thrown out into the cosmos can lead to the formation of planets			1
‘ the harsh conditions of space are extremely difficult to reproduce in the laboratory , and have long hindered efforts to interpret and analyse observations from space , ’ said project leader @entity39			0
‘ using the @entity24 simulator we can now discover clues to questions about the composition and the evolution of the universe			2
’ dust grains that form around dying stars and are thrown out into the cosmos can lead to the formation of planets and are a key component of the universe 's evolution the team started with small hydrocarbon molecules that they expanded in the cold jet spray in @entity24 and exposed to high energy in an electric discharge			1
@entity13 then detected and characterised the large molecules that are formed in the gas phase from these precursor molecules with highly sensitive detectors			0
@entity24 then collected the individual solid grains formed from these complex molecules and imaged them with a microscope			0
in the past , the inability to simulate space conditions in the gaseous state prevented scientists from identifying unknown matter			0
the @entity76 ( @entity24 ) could change this by recreating the extreme conditions that reign in space where interstellar molecules and ions float in a vacuum			0
the densities found in space are billionths of @entity20 's atmosphere and average temperatures can be less than @entity88 ( -270ºf ) ‘ we now can for the first time truly recreate and visualise in the laboratory the formation of carbon grains in the envelope of stars and learn about the formation , structure and size distribution of stellar dust grains , ’ said @entity89 of the @entity90			1
‘ this type of new research truly pushes the frontiers of science toward new horizons			0
’ the device , dubbed @entity24 , could help astronomers better understand the types of grains that form around stars and uncover secrets how @entity20 - like planets form the team started with small hydrocarbon molecules that they expanded in the cold jet spray in @entity24 and exposed to high energy in an electric discharge			1
@entity13 detected and characterised the large molecules that are formed in the gas phase from these precursor molecules with highly sensitive detectors			0
@entity24 then collected the individual solid grains formed from these complex molecules and imaged them with a microscope			0
‘ during @entity24 experiments , we are able to form and detect nanoparticles on the order of 10 nm size , grains ranging from 100 - 500 nanometers and aggregates of grains up to 1.5 micrometres in diameter , about a tenth the width of a human hair , , ’ said @entity125 , of the @entity126 and a research fellow at @entity13			1
these results have important implications and ramifications not only for interstellar astrophysics , but also for planetary science			0
for example , they can provide new clues on the type of grains present in the dust around stars			2
that in turn , will help us understand the formation of planets , including @entity20 - like planets .			1

grains around dying stars are a key component of universe 's evolution
cosmic simulator in @entity165 was able to create particles of this interstellar dust at 1.5 micrometres - a tenth of the width of a human hair
scientists hope it will help them understand how @entity20 - like planets form
