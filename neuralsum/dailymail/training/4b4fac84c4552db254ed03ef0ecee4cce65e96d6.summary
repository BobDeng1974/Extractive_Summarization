by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 29 august 2012 residents of a block of flats have been ordered to take pictures down from communal walls because they are dangerous and breach health and safety rules			1
housing bosses have warned the tenants of nine properties in @entity11 , @entity12 , that any ‘ non-compliant ’ photos and portraits will be removed and eventually destroyed after an inspection tomorrow			1
even doormats are being outlawed by the killjoys who say they are too dangerous			1
those living there say they have put up their own pictures to brighten up the corridors and some photos belonged to a former neighbour who has died			1
stunned : @entity26 and @entity27 are among the residents told they must take down their pictures from the walls of the landings as they are a ' fire hazard ' but to their dismay they were warned of the inspection in a letter from social landlord @entity38 , which runs their building			2
it said ‘ obstructive ’ or ‘ combustible ’ items - including doormats as well as picture frames - were banned from communal areas because they could potentially pose a fire hazard			1
the letter , signed by neighbourhood housing officer @entity50 , said @entity38 was prepared to allow just two pictures in the entire ground floor corridor - one on each side of the hallway			2
the letter warns anyone who fails to do so will be in breach of their tenancy agreement			2
@entity60 , 64 , said he and his neighbours had been ‘ gobsmacked ’ by the warning			2
row : this block of flats is due to be inspected and any dangerous items removed and potentially destroyed mr @entity26 , who has lived in the block for 12 years , said : ' it seems ridiculous			1
we were just trying to brighten up our home and we ’re really hurt that we ’re going to have to take them down			0
' it ’s very heavy - handed and i just ca n’t believe they see this as a priority and something they should be devoting time to enforcing			0
' if a picture frame is a fire hazard then i do n’t know where you draw the line			0
surely sending out these pointless letters could be classed as a fire hazard as well ? ' it ’s just so over the top and bizarre it ’s hard to know whether to laugh or actually get quite angry about it			0
' @entity38 was not available for comment			0
@entity89 , 68 , told @entity90 : ' it ’s stupid — we all want to keep the pictures up			0
we all see the corridors as part of our homes			0

housing bosses will inspect a @entity11 block tomorrow and will seize and could later destroy anything in communal areas they deem dangerous
some of the photos belonged to a former neighbour who has since died
