@entity0 was the star of the show and here is his heat map three days in to this @entity4 and already the champions have a weaker grip on their trophy			1
@entity8 lost the first game four years ago , too , but defeat by @entity11 in @entity12 can not compare psychologically to these stunning events in north - east @entity14			1
@entity8 ’s worst defeat since a 1963 reverse to @entity18 , this was more than a setback			1
this was a humiliating , humbling capitulation , a defeat that asks as much about the mental fortitude of @entity25 ’s team as it does their hapless defending			2
some defeats in sport represent more than the loss of a solitary contest and this was one of them			2
this was a 7 & 6 in @entity36 singles , an @entity38 defeat by an innings , a round one knockout in @entity41			2
some teams would not recover from this			2
it remains to be seen if @entity8 can			1

referee : @entity115 ( @entity116 ) attendance : man of the match : @entity49 ratings by @entity121 in @entity122 click here to view our brilliant @entity4 @entity124 @entity50 were brilliant			1
so hungry as to be ravenous and driven relentlessly forwards by the mesmeric talents of @entity49 and @entity0			1
the upshot was one of the @entity4 ’s most startling results			1
we all remember @entity132 ’s loss to @entity133 in 1990 , @entity134 succumbing to @entity135 in @entity136 12 years later			0
in the very same way , we will remember this			0
taken in isolation , the result was staggering enough			0
say it slowly to make sure it ’s real			2
what made this even more remarkable , though , was the way that it happened			0
moments before half - time , @entity8 were a goal ahead and cruising			1
had @entity77 scored when played clear at this time the champions probably would have won			0
fast forward an hour , though , and @entity8 were on their knees			1
in their eyes they had the shocked look of street mugging victims			0
@entity50 scored five and could have scored eight			1
@entity63 – who had a dreadful night – produced a stunning double save late on , while @entity99 fell over when it looked easier to score			1
' in the end , it could have been six , seven or eight , ' said @entity68			1
' but , really , it could n’t be better			0
' ultimately , the only thing that saved @entity8 was the full - time whistle			1
back in the quiet of the dressing room , they will have looked at each other and seen faces they did not recognise staring back			0
the highlights reel will , of course , show them scoring first			0
once again there was controversy about it but few will care now			0
bunch of fives : @entity0 ( left ) slams home @entity50 's fifth goal in their stunning victory over @entity8 @entity180 ( left ) bundles the ball in at the back post for @entity50 's third goal @entity0 's control and finish for @entity50 's second were sublime ... click here for more from our brilliant @entity124 turning him inside out : @entity0 gets past @entity71 after taking the ball down superbly finish : @entity70 ca n't close down @entity0 , who strikes the ball with his left foot net gain : @entity63 ( right ) is sent the wrong way as the ball goes into the goal the best 11 : @entity50 's @entity0 is arguably the player of the tournament so far pointing the finger : @entity199 tells @entity79 to get up forward @entity78 turned in the penalty area , placed his foot on a defender ’s leg and was given a penalty			1
it was a poor decision but @entity73 struck the kick to the right and @entity8 had a deserved lead			1
for a while , all was normal			0
@entity78 was struggling but it did n’t seem to matter			1
@entity75 and @entity77 enjoyed a good 15 minutes and @entity8 looked likely to score again			1
had they done so , @entity50 could n’t have complained and @entity77 ’s miss – trying to chip the goalkeeper – was certainly pivotal as within a minute or two the @entity46 were level			1
@entity46 left back @entity97 ’s pass from deep across field to @entity68 was certainly a good one			2
@entity8 failed to move out as one and the @entity60 forward was onside			2
briefly he looked as though he may control the ball but ultimately he threw himself forwards and the header that arched above and beyond @entity63 was as good as you will see			1
on terms at half - time , @entity50 would have taken a draw			2
as it transpired they emerged to humiliate @entity8			2
the @entity46 simply ca n’t have had a better 45 minutes of football			0
the second goal , in the 53rd minute , started with @entity231 once again			0
this time his target was @entity0 and the manner in which the @entity235 star controlled the ball to turn back inside @entity71 and score was wonderful			1
happy @entity50 : @entity239 high fives @entity68 after the forward 's brilliant equaliser shut up : @entity78 gestures to the @entity243 crowd , who barracked him throughout the match trip : @entity78 is caught by @entity95 inside the area in @entity243 on the way down : @entity78 is tripped by @entity180 and the referee pointed to the spot spot on : @entity73 rolls his penalty to the right of @entity92 and into the corner not too @entity73 : @entity73 celebrates putting @entity8 a goal up from the spot it was @entity8 ’s heaviest defeat since @entity18 beat them 6 - 2 in 1963			1
@entity258 beat them 4 - 0 in 2010			0
@entity8 last conceded three in @entity14 in the @entity261 final last june ( lost 3 - 0 to @entity14 ( @entity262 , @entity263 )			1
they last conceded two to @entity265 rivals @entity266 in a friendly in september			2
they lost @entity4 opener to @entity11 in 2010 ( 0 - 1 , @entity270 )			2
the @entity46 have scored as many goals against the @entity272 as they did in both their qualifying games against @entity274 combined ( 5 ) as the rain fell hard , @entity8 sought answers			2
@entity25 appeared briefly to urge them to lift their heads but they could n’t			0
he made substitutions but they did n’t work			0
the direction of the game was set , the die cast			0
goal three was a tough one			0
@entity63 ’ attempt to gather a corner was impeded by @entity68 but he simply needed to be stronger and as the ball disappeared over his head , @entity180 bundled it in on the goal line			1
here on friday night , @entity63 looked like a goalkeeper in need			2
he looks not to have recovered from his poor showing in last month ’s @entity297 final and it will be interesting to see if @entity25 drops him next week and , if so , who out of @entity299 or @entity91 comes in			0
' i wo n’t blame individuals , ' said @entity25			0
' but we must improve			0
we can not go under			0
' certainly what happened in the 72nd minute would n’t have helped @entity63 ’ cause			2
trying to control a simple back pass , the goalkeeper only managed to present the ball to @entity68 and goal no 4 was poked in to the empty goal as @entity50 took events from the surprising to the simply unforgettable			1
thwarted : @entity77 sees his chip comfortably saved by @entity92 waste : @entity99 hits his shot straight at the keeper when through on goal proceed with caution : @entity95 ( second right ) is shown the yellow card by @entity115 @entity320 : @entity73 and @entity0 compete for a ball in the air as the @entity46 goes flying stop right there : @entity50 defender @entity324 ( left ) grabs hold of @entity8 midfielder @entity77 still there was time for a fifth			1
more mistakes from @entity8 , a gallop forward by @entity0 past @entity70 and another devastating finish			1
on the @entity46 bench , coach @entity239 smiled and tried to look phlegmatic			0
' we can get better , without a shadow of a doubt , ' he said later			0
@entity25 , meanwhile , placed a towel across his knee as the rain fell			0
he may well have placed it over his head .			0

@entity73 gave @entity8 the lead from penalty spot in @entity4 @entity265
@entity68 equalised for @entity50 with a flying header
@entity0 put them ahead with a superb strike after beating @entity71
@entity180 bundled home no 3
@entity68 took advantage of @entity63 ' mistake to make it four
@entity0 rounded off the devastating victory
@entity78 was booed throughout by the @entity243 crowd
