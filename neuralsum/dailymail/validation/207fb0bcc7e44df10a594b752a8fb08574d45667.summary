penalty : top lawyer @entity1 faces a fine of £ 1.2million for failing to pay inheritance tax on his father 's estate a leading barrister has been ordered to pay a £ 1.2million penalty after he failed to pay his father 's inheritance tax bill for 10 years after his death			1
@entity1 , one of the country 's top experts in commercial and property law , repeatedly refused to reveal how much his father 's estate was worth and did not respond to requests to pay inheritance tax			1
a judge criticised his ' wholly unacceptable ' and ' disgraceful ' behaviour towards the tax authorities , adding that he was not ' open and candid about his affairs '			2
the barrister resigned as head of his chambers for ' personal reasons ' shortly before the tax tribunal judgment was made earlier this month			1
mr @entity25 , 67 , has practised as a barrister for 45 years , and became a qc in 1995			0
until his recent resignation , he was head of @entity29 , based near the @entity30 in central @entity31			0
he recently defeated @entity32 in a @entity34 dispute over one of the celebrity chef 's pubs , and has represented high - profile figures including @entity39			1
@entity40 took him to a tribunal last year after it emerged that he had run up enormous bills for unpaid income and inheritance tax			1
mr @entity25 's father @entity45 died in march 2005 without making a will , the tribunal heard , but an assessment of the size of his estate was not given to @entity40 until four years later			1
tax officials disputed mr @entity25 's estimate of his father 's wealth , which was largely contained in shares , and sent mr @entity25 a string of letters demanding further information			1
despite being hit with non-compliance penalties of more than £ 30,000 , mr @entity25 did not give @entity40 the information they needed and was taken to the @entity62 in may last year			2
at that hearing he blamed ' a lack of organisation ' for his failure to respond properly , and although judge @entity67 said the barrister ' commanded little sympathy ' he agreed to give him five weeks to comply with @entity40 's demands , which he described as a ' last chance ' to get his affairs in order			2
at a second tribunal hearing held in @entity31 in october , the judge was told that mr @entity25 had still not sent the necessary information to @entity40			1
judge @entity67 said that the information he had provided was ' wholly inadequate ' , adding : ' i have not doubt that mr @entity25 must have been aware that it was inadequate			2
' in his evidence , mr @entity25 said that he had earned ' very substantial fees ' during his career , added that though he had often filed tax returns late he was keen to fulfil his liabilities			0
he also said it was difficult to work out the size of his father 's estate , as @entity25 was ' secretive ' about money and had much of his wealth tied up in a variety of shareholdings			1
work : mr @entity25 has recently stepped down as head of @entity94 , pictured , in central @entity31 but the judge said in his ruling that it was ' difficult if not impossible ' to understand why mr @entity25 did not entrust his tax affairs to an accountant , given that he was ' unwillng or insufficiently skilled ' to take care of them himself			2
he added : ' i regret to say that i am not satisfied that mr @entity25 is as keen to be open and candid about his affairs as he would have me believe			0
' judge @entity67 also cast doubt on whether the lawyer ' truly was attempting to be co-operative ' , continuing : ' i am unconvinced that mr @entity25 has been as candid as he should be about his late father 's affairs '			2
the judge resolved to impose a penalty on mr @entity25 under the terms of the @entity113 , which allows tribunals to impose financial penalties taking into account unpaid tax bills			2
mr @entity25 claimed that the amount of inheritance tax he owed was no more than £ 75,000 , but judge @entity67 agreed with @entity40 that the true figure was at least £ 1,171,020			1
the judge ruled that mr @entity25 should pay a penalty totalling the entire amount of unpaid inheritance tax , along with a separate penalty for unpaid income tax , meaning that the final figure the lawyer owes is £ 1,246,020			1
cases : mr @entity25 recently defeated @entity32 , left , at the @entity34 , and he has also represented @entity39 , right , in a legal dispute in a scathing judgment delivered earlier this month , he said that mr @entity25 had done ' too little too late ' to resolve the case , and had ' repeatedly and persistently fobbed @entity40 off '			1
he added : ' his earlier conduct as i have described it was , not to mince words , disgraceful			0
' the judge concluded : ' his conduct ... can only be regarded as contemptuous ; and his reckless offer of undertakings to this tribunal , followed by his , as i perceive it , insouciant attitude to his non-compliance , are of a similar character			0
' judge @entity67 also remarked that ' if all taxpayers behaved as mr @entity25 has done the administration of tax would become impossible			0
' the barrister plans to appeal against the ruling , but in the meantime he must pay the £ 1.25million penalty within a few weeks			0
if @entity40 succeeds in obtaining a full record of his late father 's estate , mr @entity25 could face a further hefty tax bill , as the penalty imposed by the tribunal does not cancel out tax liabilities			1
the total size of his father 's estate is not known , but if the inheritance tax assessment of £ 1.17million is correct then it is likely to be worth at least £ 3.4million			1
charity : @entity166 opened the @entity167 , an autism treatment centre in @entity169 funded by mr @entity25 's family , in june 2009 mr @entity25 admitted that he had not acted with ' alacrity and attention ' in his personal tax affairs , but denied deliberately hiding information from the authorities			2
he told @entity176 : ' throughout my 44 years at the bar i have conducted myself with utter professionalism , commitment and attention to detail			0
the decision of the tribunal , concerning as it does wholly uncharacteristic behaviour , is therefore a matter of deep personal regret to me			0
' i did not act in my tax affairs with the same alacrity and attention as i have conducted myself professionally and i accept that regretfully , i did not comply with the relevant notices in a timely fashion or with the undertaking to the tribunal			0
' while i accept that there were delays in providing information to @entity40 , there was never any deliberate concealment or intentional withholding of information , and my evidence to @entity40 and to the tribunal was honest and truthful			0
' i have always been anxious to pay the correct amount of tax , erring on the side of caution in calculating potential tax due and consciously making overpayments if in doubt as to the amount payable			0
' in february @entity94 announced that mr @entity25 was to stand down as head of chambers ' for personal reasons '			1
it is not known whether or not this decision was related to his tax affairs			0
mr @entity25 recently won a @entity34 case against @entity32 on behalf of film director @entity218 , after the celebrity chef claimed his signature had been forged on the lease for the @entity223 & @entity224 pub in north @entity31 , which is owned by mr @entity218			1
he also represented ex-mp @entity39 in a dispute over a £ 1.3million deal to buy an antiques company , and is acting for billionaire tycoon @entity228 in a £ 2.2billion claim against a group of accountants who allegedly embroiled the businessman in a @entity234 investigation			0
a residential home for autistic people which was funded by and named after mr @entity25 's family was opened by @entity166 in 2009 in the grounds of the @entity240 community in @entity169 .			0
