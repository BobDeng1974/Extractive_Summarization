even @entity0 was n’t relegated to the reserves			1
but for £ 250,000 - per - week @entity3 – perhaps the most handsomely - rewarded second - string striker in history – this was the ultimate indignity			1
does he feel an injustice , angry with @entity7 for such a degrading demotion ? or is there an acceptance that his powers have faded ? in fact , they ’ve gone out like a light			0
@entity15 has scored just four goals since arriving at @entity17 his latest run out was for the @entity19 as they faced @entity20 on tuesday night at least with fellow £ 50million flop torres his decline was something of a slow burn , occasionally illuminated by a flicker of glories past			1
sadly , for @entity3 , there is no sign of him emerging from the darkness at @entity31			1
an unused substitute as @entity17 struggled for a goal ( @entity3 has scored more than 200 in his career ) during their 2 - 1 defeat by @entity38 in monday ’s @entity40 quarter - final , the @entity32 was back at the @entity41 24 hours later for an under 21 fixture against @entity20			1
he was n’t there to cheer on the club ’s next generation , he was lining up alongside them			0
@entity17 insist it was a fitness exercise			2
but fitness is allied to form , and @entity3 certainly does n't boast the latter right now			2
@entity3 fluffed his lines and missed several chances during a win over @entity53 back in january the striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at @entity31 @entity7 must decide whether to take up the option to buy @entity3 at the end of his loan spell he failed to score against @entity20 , fluffed one chance and was then withdrawn – a synopsis which could well be applied to the majority of his outings since his £ 6m loan move from @entity67			1
the beauty of that arrangement – and it ’s something of an ugly truth – is that @entity17 are not committed to making his stay permanent and there is zero chance of them doing so after his failure to impact , four goals from 19 appearances his sorry return			1
compare that with the 70 strikes from 91 matches for @entity84 and his demise is given some numerical context			0
@entity3 drew a blank against @entity89 in the @entity40 last month he also struggled against @entity90 from @entity91 in the previous round celebrations have been few and far between for @entity3 , pictured here after scoring against @entity94 @entity95 2005 - 06 - @entity96 11 goals 7 2006 - 07 - @entity96 20 goals 3 2007 - 08 games 39 goals 19 2008 - 09 games 35 goals 16 @entity103 2009 - 10 games 43 goals 34 2010 - 11 games 42 goals 38 2011 - 12 games 2 goals 0 @entity84 2011 - 12 games 50 goals 36 2012 - 13 games 41 goals 34 @entity67 2013 - 14 games 19 goals 11 2014 - 15 games 3 goals 2 @entity17 2014 - 15 games 19 goals 4 it was , of course , in the colours of @entity84 that @entity3 smashed a devastating hat - trick past @entity123 in the @entity124 of 2012			1
every tribute in the wake of that demolition job determined that @entity3 was ready - made for the @entity128 – pace , power , potency , he had the lot			2
even his pre-madrid existence supported the assertion that he was the continent ’s most feared goal - getter			0
there were 72 goals from just 87 games at @entity103 , winning with them a @entity141 title , cup and @entity143 , a prize he defended the following season in @entity147			0
his spells at @entity103 and @entity84 were bookended by @entity95 and @entity67 , where again his ratio was as good as one - in - two			0
but it was that move to @entity67 which proved fateful in the loss of @entity154 ’s finest front man			0
with a transfer fee of £ 52m and salary of around £ 15m , there were obvious accusations – defended by @entity3 – behind his motivation			2
however , it was the knee injury suffered in january of last year which robbed him of a place at the @entity164 and , on the evidence of this season , a whole lot more than a mere ticket to @entity169			0
@entity3 was on holiday during the @entity164 as he missed out following a long injury lay - off @entity3 scored goals for fun during his days as an @entity84 player he won the @entity143 with @entity103 in 2011 and again with @entity84 the following year @entity3 is still a @entity67 player having signed for @entity17 on a season - long loan gone are the razor - sharp reactions of body and mind			1
gone is the swagger , the confidence , the belief that he is the best			0
sound familiar ? over four , long years at @entity123 we witnessed the regression of @entity0			2
in the end he left having scored just 20 league goals in 110 games			2
@entity3 will be lucky if he leaves @entity17 with 20 league appearances , let alone goals			1
@entity0 , of course , now resides back at @entity84 , his connection with the club affording him a second chance			0
at 29 and with his best days very much behind him , perhaps a similar fate awaits @entity3 .			0

@entity3 has scored four goals since arriving at @entity31
@entity17 are unlikely to take up the option to buy him
he was forced to play for the @entity19 against @entity20 on tuesday
@entity3 drew a blank for the second string
his fall from the *top* is the most *spectacular* since @entity0
