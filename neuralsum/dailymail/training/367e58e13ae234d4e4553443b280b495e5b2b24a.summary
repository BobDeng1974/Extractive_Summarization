by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 23 january 2013 penguins with video cameras strapped to their backs have given researchers an incredible glimpse into their ruthless hunting methods			1
the footage shows @entity9 penguins in waters off the coast of @entity13 diving in both shallow and deep waters			1
during about 88 minutes of diving recorded , the @entity13 birds devoured 244 krill and 33 @entity18 fish , the team found - with not a single target missed			1
watch the video below using video cameras weighing just 33 grammes ( around 1 oz ) and equipped with accelerometers , depth gauges and thermometers , researchers were able to see exactly what the penguin sees			1
the accelerometers also measured how the birds moved - allowing them to see the birds using a ' snapping ' motion to catch fish			0
' the foraging behaviour of @entity9 is remarkably fast and efficient , ' the scientists write in @entity36			2
the study was led by two @entity39 scientists , @entity40 and @entity41 at the @entity42 in @entity43			0
they attached video cameras to the birds backs , and small accelerometers to the birds ' bodies and heads			1
the film was recorded between december 2010 and early february 2011			0
footage from @entity9 penguins in waters off the coast of @entity13 showed the birds darting at krill , snapping up fish , and hunting down prey beneath sheets of floating ice in the @entity62 bay area			1
the video also reveals the astonishing speed of the birds			0
the penguins swimming out to sea before they dive , as captured by the penguin - cam @entity68 chase small fish underwater , snapping their head sideways to catch them the video captures over 80 minutes of dives from penguins , revealing their hunting tactics for the first time one penguin swam into a dense swarm of krill and captured two of the shrimp - like creatures in one second , and researchers said their ability to surprise prey was astonishing			2
' escape behaviour of the fish was not evident in most cases , suggesting an excellent stealth approach by penguins , ' the scientists write			0
' however , in two cases , they chased a p borchgrevinki toward the underside of the sea ice and caught it there , as if they used the ice surface as a barrier , ' they add			0
@entity100 penguins leaping off icebergs : scientists have now released camera footage showing exactly what they see when they hunt @entity105 and fish called bald notothens ( @entity108 ) made up 96 % of the food the penguins caught			0
@entity40 said the accelerometer -- a device also used in mobile phones , tablet computers and games consoles -- allowed researchers to precisely measure the bird 's head movements and showed how one penguin could catch two krill in under a second			0
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) was found to be a ruthless killer that never missed its target ' now we know what the @entity9 penguin preys on and how much it eats , we can understand how the penguin survives and how it relates to its environment , ' he said			1
the cameras also revealed that the penguins turned their heads quickly to engulf prey			2
the penguin 's fragile @entity13 habitat is at risk from climate change , with scientists warning that as pack ice melts , their numbers could fall @entity141 said the tiny cameras and micro equipment had given researchers a much better understanding of how the penguin lives			2
" we now understand how much they rely on those fish that inhabit water just below the sea ice , which means that @entity9 penguins can only survive in a sea ice environment , " said @entity40 .			1

researchers found that not a single target was missed
