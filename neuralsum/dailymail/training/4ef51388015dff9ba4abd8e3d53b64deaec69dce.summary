by @entity0 miss @entity1 had died after ' serious failings ' by paramedics , and heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections two paramedics have been struck off after they told a dying woman to stay at home because she only had a ‘ tummy bug ’			1
hours later @entity1 , 30 , was dead because her symptoms were not taken seriously by the pair of ‘ incompetent ’ ambulance workers who refused to take her to hospital			1
paramedic @entity14 told her she just had stomach bug even though she was barely conscious and struggling to breathe			1
miss @entity1 would have survived if she was taken to hospital and given a simple injection , an inquest has already been told			1
now a disciplinary hearing has heard that @entity14 and his colleague @entity20 then tried to cover up their mistake by fabricating her clinical record			1
the pair were banned from working as paramedics by a disciplinary panel of the @entity27			0
panel chair @entity28 said : ‘ the public would be appalled at the lack of competence			0
‘ the facts of the case would undermine public confidence in the profession in the eyes of any member of the public who was aware of the circumstances			0
’ he went on : ‘ when there is a case of proven dishonesty it is necessary to uphold regulatory standards by demonstrating that such behaviour is not acceptable			0
’ miss @entity1 was visited at her home in @entity48 , @entity49 , by the two paramedics following a 999 call			2
@entity14 and @entity20 , ( not pictured ) who were working for the @entity51 , ' colluded to fabricate a patient record ' ( picture posed by models ) but a @entity27 hearing was told how @entity14 failed check her vital signs including pulse , breathing and blood oxygenation			1
the dental nurse had diabetes and her pituitary gland had been removed after surgery for a brain tumour			0
an inquest earlier this year found that miss @entity1 had died after ‘ serious failings ’ by paramedics , and heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections			1
but the hearing in @entity70 was told that @entity14 failed to ask suitable questions about her medical history before her death in may 2007			2
he told her : ‘ you just have a stomach bug			1
you are better off here @entity1 , this is the best place for you			2
’ but the patient died just six hours later of adrenal insufficiency - when her body stopped producing the necessary steroid hormones			0
@entity14 and @entity20 , who were working for the @entity51 , then ‘ colluded to fabricate a patient record ’ the hearing was told			1
the pair added information they got later from another paramedic in an attempt to cover up their failures			2
mr @entity28 added : ‘ the panel was of the view that the established failure to conduct a proper assessment			0
‘ the subsequent dishonest fabrication and collusion are very serious , representing a disregard for fundamental and core duties			0
‘ it had the potential of causing very significant degree of harm - including death			0
’ the inquest in february this year heard miss @entity1 was battling the after - effects of a brain tumour when an ambulance was called			1
coroner @entity107 said then : ‘ there were serious failings in the way in which the crew went about their assessment and recording her condition that night			0
’ he added : ‘ if @entity1 had been taken to hospital it was likely she would have received intravenous hydrocortisone injections and fluids , and her death would not have occurred			2
‘ but given the crew ’s lack of knowledge and the rarity of @entity1 ’s condition , this can not be labelled as gross failings			0
