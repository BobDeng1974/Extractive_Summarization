@entity0 is fearful of his @entity2 side being on the receiving end of a @entity5 backlash			1
the @entity2 travel to @entity6 on saturday in good heart following a 3 - 1 home win over @entity9 last weekend - while @entity5 continue to struggle for consistency despite @entity12 's summer spending spree			1
many will still see the hosts as favourites going into the game but their vulnerabilities in defence were highlighted once again as they let a two - goal lead slip to lose 5 - 3 at @entity20 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity0 fears @entity2 will receive a @entity5 backlash after their defeat to @entity20 but that result , @entity0 fears , could see the likes of @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 in no mood for a similar outcome against his side as they look to replicate their last home outing - a comfortable 4 - 0 victory over @entity33			1
' no. i 'm thinking a backlash , ' he said when asked if it was a good time to face @entity12 's side			2
' i think that because of the determination of the @entity5 players and the fact they are playing at @entity6			2
@entity27 and @entity25 could combine together to cause @entity2 problems ' i know there 's quite a lot of new players playing there but certainly the demand of @entity5 is huge and they 'll be really fired up to make sure that they try and perform like they did against @entity33 and beat us			1
' they will be pretty down about that performance they gave at @entity20 and they will be hurting and they know the only way they can put that right is to get out onto the field and punish us for it - so we will have to be careful about that			1
' a draw would be great for me , anything more than a draw would be outstanding as far as i 'm concerned			0
' they ( the @entity2 players ) have got to look forward to a tough game at @entity6 now and test their skills and test their ability at a stadium that can obviously be daunting for some players			2
' hopefully our new players wo n't be daunted about the prospect of playing at @entity6 on saturday			0
' @entity0 sympathised with @entity74 's problems with seamlessly integrating his new recruits into the set - up at @entity6			0
@entity5 record signing @entity26 will be looking impress again at @entity6 @entity2 themselves have brought in nine new faces since the end of last season and @entity0 insists getting so many new players to gel is not an easy task for anyone			1
' it 's not an excuse , it is an actual fact , ' he said			0
' if you 've got your players to settle quicker then that is a bonus when you have brought in as many players as i have and as many players as @entity5 have			2
' irrespective of the talent , you 've got to work as a team and to do that you need to understand each other - you need time			0
' you ca n't just walk into a club for two days and say ' i know his strengths and weaknesses , i know his talent '			0
' the @entity2 travel to @entity103 without one of his additions , as midfielder @entity107 will miss up to six weeks with a groin injury - something @entity0 described as a ' blow '			1
captain @entity111 has returned to training but will not feature at @entity6 whereas another option , @entity114 , has been loaned out to @entity117 side @entity115			0
