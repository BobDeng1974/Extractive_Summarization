goalkeeper @entity0 believes monday night 's victory over @entity2 will see the @entity4 squad regain their confidence ahead of the @entity6 with @entity7			1
a brace from @entity9 saw @entity10 pick up their second win of the season and move off the bottom of the @entity14 - moving to within three points of @entity2 in the process			1
in a game of little quality , it was former @entity20 forward @entity9 who settled the game , but @entity0 also played his part as @entity4 boss @entity24 saw his side pick up just their second clean sheet of the campaign			1
@entity0 applauds the @entity4 crowd after just his second clean sheet of the season during monday night 's win the result may hold more importance for the @entity34 , who face local rivals @entity7 at @entity36 on saturday before welcoming reigning champions @entity37 to @entity38			1
and @entity0 - who recovered from an illness to take his place in goal for @entity4 in time to replace @entity42 ( thigh strain ) - feels he and his team - mates are now ready for the challenges ahead			1
' it is pleasing to get the win , i 'm delighted for everyone , ' he said			0
' it gives you that little bit of a lift going into two tough games			1
if we had n't won you 'd be looking at the next two games with a bit more concern			1
' i think games at home in this respect are key so it is that bit more pleasing			2
it reinstalls the belief you 've got			0
@entity0 gets down smartly to thwart on - rushing @entity2 striker @entity65 ' particularly at home , you play against teams and if you really give it a go and put it to teams then sometimes they ca n't come up with answers			1
' we asked questions of @entity2 going forward quickly , hitting @entity74 ( @entity75 ) and stuff like that and it proved fruitful			1
' in that respect it is finding a way to win games , finding a way to cause problems and believing in our own ability as much as anything			2
' if it means killing games off after an hour then so be it that is the sort of thing you have to do			2
' high - profile summer signing @entity93 was again left on the bench as @entity4 kept @entity2 , the league 's lowest scorers with just four goals , at bay with @entity99 and @entity101 defender @entity100 developing an understanding			1
the @entity4 no 1 has been impressed with the central defensive pairing of @entity99 and @entity100 both scored unfortunate own goals in the 3 - 2 defeat to @entity108 but were kept at the heart of @entity24 's defence on monday night , with @entity0 impressed by @entity112 's display			1
' @entity113 is @entity113 - he gives his all , ' he added			2
' he 's great at what he 's great at and he 's a great player to play behind because you know what you 're going to get			2
' he is consistent in that respect			0
you look at something like the play - off final			2
he came off man of the match and proved his worth			0
' you could have signed him on a 10 - year contract off the back of that game			0
i think @entity113 was in fantastic form against his old club			0
' striker @entity9 ( left ) was @entity4 's hero with two goals , one in each half despite @entity2 going for almost nine hours without a goal , it was at the back where manager @entity136 was critical			1
skipper @entity137 was partnered in defence with @entity139 and the @entity140 international knows the villains need to turn around their run of five straight defeats to start breeding more faith among the players			0
' it is frustrating to lose again , ' he told @entity148			0
' we started quite well and conceded a goal - we have to do better that is for sure			0
' we have to start picking up points again , results give confidence and that is what we have to do			0
it is easier said than done but we have to work hard to achieve something and then build on that			0
' it is always easy to talk afterwards about what went wrong and what the problems are but there is only one thing we have to do and that is step up			0
