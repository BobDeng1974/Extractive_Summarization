while there are long - lasting cosmetics on the market , the results do n't always match the claims on the label			2
earlier this month , an @entity9 woman from @entity58 sued make - up giant @entity59 on the grounds that its @entity62 foundation , which promises ' 24 - hour wear for divine , lasting perfection , ' ' faded significantly ' overnight			1
@entity66 had applied the $ 45 foundation on friday evening in order to test its 24 - hour performance in the run - up to her son 's june bar mitzvah , set to take place on a saturday during the @entity7			1

these goods are entirely powder - based and do not attach to the skin			0
therefore they do not fall into the forbidden categories of ' dyeing ' or ' smoothing ' .			0

every friday at sundown , @entity9 women are forbidden from applying make - up for 24 hours to comply with religious laws
