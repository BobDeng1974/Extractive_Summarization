by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 18:37 est , 15 june 2012 more than a million patients will face disruption because of the first doctors ’ strike in nearly 40 years next week			1
members of the @entity6 will refuse to treat patients for 24 hours unless their condition is life - threatening or urgent			1
but thursday ’s day of action over changes to doctors ’ pensions has already led to the cancellation of tens of thousands of cataract operations , hip and knee replacements and many more routine tests and scans			1
a first in 40 years : members of the @entity6 will strike over changes to doctors ' pensions protecting pay : the pensions reform will mean doctors have to contribute more and retire later in addition , 1.25million gp appointments will also be postponed – including 400,000 involving the elderly and 140,000 for children			1
last night there were fears that the strike would immediately create a huge backlog that will have knock - on effects for the @entity35 for several weeks			1
patients whose operations , hospital tests or scans were due to take place on thursday have been sent cancellation letters but many have still to be given a new appointment date			2
last night the @entity44 warned this could take some time			0
other victims of the dispute include 1,350 waiting for cataract surgery and 700 awaiting hip and knee replacements			0
another 7,500 with heart problems have had appointments cancelled and a further 7,500 paediatric appointments will be postponed around 9,500 pregnant women have had tests and scans cancelled and 200,000 hospital outpatient appointments will need to be rescheduled			2
@entity58 wards will remain open , however , and doctors have pledged to treat anyone with an urgent complaint			2
but @entity62 , of pressure group @entity63 , said : ‘ it is absolute nonsense for the @entity6 to claim that the interests of their patients are paramount			1
condemned : the strike on june 21 - the first industrial action by the profession in almost 40 years - has been widely criticised by politicians and the public still open : accident and emergency departments will remain open and doctors have promised to treat anyone with an urgent complaint ‘ frankly the industrial action is an outrage			1
the doctors in this country are among the best paid , with the most generous pensions in the world			2
’ @entity85 , chief executive of the @entity86 ’ @entity6 , has warned that the strike is a ‘ huge risk ’ because of the difficulty of working out who needs treatment and who can wait			2
working overtime : health secretary @entity93 has urged doctors to work at the weekend to clear the backlog caused by the strike @entity97 , director of the @entity99 organisation , said he was ‘ very worried ’ about the protest			0
he added : ‘ doctors know any industrial action will impact on care and cause distress and disruption to patients and undermine trust in the medical profession			0
’ health secretary @entity93 has told those gps planning to strike to consider working the following saturday to clear the backlog of appointments			0
in a letter to the @entity6 ’s head @entity113 , he says they must ensure patients are seen quickly as ‘ today ’s routine appointments could become tomorrow ’s emergencies ’			1
but because gps are self - employed – and mr @entity93 is n’t technically their boss – they are unlikely to agree to make up the lost time in this way			0
most gps have not done a weekend shift since 2004 when a deal brought in by @entity125 enabled them to opt - out of out - of - hours work			0
responding to the letter , dr @entity113 told mr @entity93 that the decision to take action ‘ was not taken lightly ’			0
it remains unclear how many of the 150,000 doctors in @entity132 and @entity133 will take part in thursday ’s protest and many have admitted they are deeply opposed			0
but the @entity6 is angry that reforms to their pensions will mean doctors have to contribute more and retire later			1
at present , a consultant earning £ 120,000 can expect to retire at 60 on an annual pension of £ 48,000 , with a £ 140,000 lump sum			0
the decision to stage industrial action followed a ballot involving 52,000 members , of whom the majority voted in favour			0
but another 52,000 members did n’t return their voting slips and at least 50,000 other doctors do not belong to the @entity6 .			1
