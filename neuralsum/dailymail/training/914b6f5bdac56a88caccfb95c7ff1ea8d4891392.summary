from the position of a woman ’s ‘ bump ’ to the movement of a suspended ring , there are many old wives ’ tales that claim to be able to predict the sex of an unborn child			2
but now mothers - to - be may want to keep an eye on the world ’s weather , as experts have suggested that changing temperatures affect the sex of babies			2
a @entity19 study has found that more baby girls are born , compared to boys , when temperatures rise in the country			1
a @entity19 study has found that more baby girls are born , compared to boys , when temperatures rise in the country			1
it reinforces previous research that suggests temperature plays a role in the sex ratio - but some of the results contradict each other ‘ the recent temperature fluctuations in @entity19 seem to be linked to a lower male : female sex ratio of newborn infants , partly via increased male foetal deaths , ’ according to scientists from @entity43 and @entity45 women 's clinic , both in @entity46 , as well as the @entity47			1
‘ male concepti seem to be especially vulnerable to external stress factors , including climate changes , ’ they wrote in a study published in the journal , @entity51 and @entity52			1
previous studies have also shown that the sex ratio is sensitive to factors such as temperature			1
researchers recently found that more girls are born in tropical countries than boys , but warmer periods in @entity66 led to more baby boys being born , @entity60 reported			2
this reveals that some studies seem to contradict one another			0
earlier this year , pollution in central @entity72 was linked to a skew in the sex ratio in favour of girls			1
previous studies have shown that the sex ratio is sensitive to factors such as temperature			1
researchers have found that more girls are born in tropical countries than boys , but warmer periods in @entity66 led to more baby boys being born			2
a stock image of a pregnant woman is pictured to come up with the latest results , experts in @entity19 studied birth records and miscarriages in @entity19 between 1968 and 2012			2
overall , more girls were born compared to boys and temperature fluctuations – particularly from a hot summer to a cold winter – saw the sex ratio become temporarily more pronounced			1
the study claims that temperature fluctuations have influenced the ratio , but makes it clear that climate change may not be responsible for skewing the number of girls and boys that are born			1
climate change affects people living in poor parts of cities more than more affluent residents , a study claims			0
@entity108 , a researcher at @entity109 said that people living in poor neighbourhoods are at the most risk of suffering from heat - related illnesses			0
this is because poor areas tend to be more cramped and are hotter overall than more desirable places , which may have wider boulevards or parks , she told @entity120			0
in poorer neighbouroods , buildings may be built from cheaper materials that retain heat and few people may own air conditioners			0
in a study of @entity128 , dr @entity108 found a link between the affluence of neighbourhoods and the number of people who died from heat - related ailment , which are known to affect senior citizens			0
@entity136 , a researcher at the @entity137 , said that climate change effects poorer neighbourhoods more because many people do manual labour			0
they may spend long periods of time outside in high temperatures and come home to a hot building where they are more likely to suffer from heat stroke , she said			0
it does however seem to reinforce previous studies that have found that male foetuses are more susceptible to events that can stress pregnant women , such as extreme heat waves			1
‘ two climate extremes , a very hot summer in 2010 and a very cold winter in january 2011 , showed not only statistically significant declines in sex ratios of newborn infants 9 months later in june 2011 and october 2011 but also statistically significant increases of foetal death rates immediately , in september 2010 and january 2011 , ’ the researchers wrote			0
animal studies have shown that rainy periods lead to more male chimpanzees , while loggerhead turtles produce more female offspring in warmer waters			0
temperature is also known to determine the sex of reptiles			0
if the world is getting hotter and rising temporaries do favour the birth of girls , a change to the global sex ratio may happen one day			1
a study in 2002 found that 101 boys are born compared to 100 girls			1
another study has found that climate change affects people living in the poor parts of cities ( such as @entity128 , pictured ) than more affluent residents			2
this is because poor areas tend to be more cramped and are hotter than more desirable places , which may have wider boulevards or parks			0

study in @entity19 suggests temperature affects the sex of babies
more girls were born than boys during a period of rising temperatures
experts found unborn boys are more vulnerable to external stress factors
previous studies also found that temperature affects the sex ratio
