by @entity1 reporter published : 11:16 est , 21 april 2012 updated : 17:18 est , 21 april 2012 hundreds of thousands of people could lose access to the internet by july following a hackers ' scam - and they do n't even know it			1
unknown to most of them , their problem began when international hackers ran an online advertising scam to take control of infected computers around the world			1
in a highly unusual response , the @entity16 set up a safety net months ago using government computers to prevent @entity21 disruptions for those infected users			1
but that system is to be shut down			0
connection timebomb : most victims do n't even know their computers have been infected , although the malicious software probably has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software , making their machines more vulnerable to other problems infected : it is estimated that a network of about 570,000 computers was targeted by hackers now , the @entity16 is encouraging users to visit a website run by its security partner that will inform them whether they 're infected and explain how to fix the problem			1
after july 9 , infected users wo n't be able to connect to the @entity21			0
most victims do n't even know their computers have been infected , although the malicious software probably has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software , making their machines more vulnerable to other problems			1
last november , the @entity16 and other authorities were preparing to take down a hacker ring that had been running an @entity21 ad scam on a massive network of infected computers			1
@entity49 , an @entity16 supervisory special agent , said : ' we started to realise that we might have a little bit of a problem on our hands because ... if we just pulled the plug on their criminal infrastructure and threw everybody in jail , the victims of this were going to be without internet service			1
' the average user would open up @entity62 and get ` page not found ' and think the @entity21 is broken			0
' on the night of the arrests , the agency brought in @entity66 , chairman and founder of @entity68 , to install two internet servers to take the place of the truckload of impounded rogue servers that infected computers were using			1
federal officials planned to keep their servers online until march , giving everyone opportunity to clean their computers			2
but it was n't enough time			0
a federal judge in @entity81 extended the deadline until july			0
@entity49 added : ' the full court press is on to get people to address this problem			0
' hackers infected a network of probably more than 570,000 computers worldwide			2
the number of victims is hard to pinpoint , but the @entity16 believes that on the day of the arrests , at least 568,000 unique internet addresses were using the rogue servers			1
five months later , @entity16 estimates that the number is down to at least 360,000			2
the @entity96 has the most , about 85,000 , federal authorities said			0
other countries with more than 20,000 each include @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
smaller numbers are online in @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
@entity66 said most of the victims are probably individual home users , rather than corporations that have technology staffs who routinely check the computers			2
they took advantage of vulnerabilities in the @entity118 operating system to install malicious software on the victim computers			0
this turned off antivirus updates and changed the way the computers reconcile website addresses behind the scenes on the @entity21 's domain name system			0
the dns system is a network of servers that translates a web address - such as www.ap.org - into the numerical addresses that computers use			2
victim computers were reprogrammed to use rogue @entity136 servers owned by the attackers			1
this allowed the attackers to redirect computers to fraudulent versions of any website			0
the hackers earned profits from advertisements that appeared on websites that victims were tricked into visiting			2
the scam netted the hackers at least $ 14 million , according to the @entity16			1
it also made thousands of computers reliant on the rogue servers for their internet browsing			1
when the @entity16 and others arrested six @entity156 last november , the agency replaced the rogue servers with @entity66 's clean ones			1
installing and running the two substitute servers for eight months is costing the federal government about $ 87,000			0
@entity16 officials said they had taken the unusual step of organising a system to avoid any appearance of government intrusion into the @entity21 or private computers			1
and while this is the first time the @entity16 used it , it wo n't be the last			2
@entity169 , the @entity16 's @entity170 unit chief , said : ' this is the future of what we will be doing			0
' until there is a change in legal system , both inside and outside the @entity96 , to get up to speed with the cyber problem , we will have to go down these paths , trail - blazing if you will , on these types of investigations			0
' now , he said , every time the agency gets near the end of a cyber case , ' we get to the point where we say , how are we going to do this , how are we going to clean the system ' without creating a bigger mess than before			0
rogue servers : the @entity16 ( pictured ) believes at least 568,000 users could have been affected by the hackers			1

international hackers took control of at least *550,000* computers
@entity16 takes unusual step of setting up a safety net to prevent internet disruptions
most victims are *unaware* they have been affected after using rogue servers
