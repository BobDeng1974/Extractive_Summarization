by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 05:33 est , 28 august 2013 the chancellor has come under growing pressure from mps and peers to split up @entity5			1
in an open letter @entity6 , chair of the influential banking commission , said ‘ all the options ’ for the state backed lender ’s future should be ‘ examined as a matter of urgency ’			1
the @entity15 mp also dismissed one of the main reasons given by opponents to the split			2
chancellor @entity20 has come under growing pressure from mps and peers to split up @entity5 he argued that creating a ‘ bad bank ’ which would continue to be owned by the state would not inflict more harm on the economy or @entity27 taxpayers			1
the forthright letter was signed by all ten members of the @entity30 on @entity31 , including the archbishop of @entity33 and former chancellor @entity34			1
@entity34 has led calls to split @entity5 into a ‘ good ’ bank to boost lending to the economy and a ‘ bad ’ bank , which will house all its toxic assets and loans			1
the idea is the good bank will also be easier to sell back to the private sector			2
at his annual @entity45 speech in june , chancellor @entity20 launched into an independent inquiry into the merits of the radical move			1
@entity20 had previously been vehemently opposed to a break up , arguing it would be too time consuming , expensive and complicated			2
but he caved in to pressure when the banking commission , which he set up in the wake of the @entity55 interest rate rigging scandal , demanded an independent enquiry			1
in an open letter @entity6 , chair of the influential banking commission , said ' all the options ' for the state backed lender ¿ s future should be ' examined as a matter of urgency ' the forthright letter was signed by all ten members of the @entity30 on @entity31 , including the archbishop of @entity33 in a letter to the @entity67 , @entity6 ratcheted up the pressure on @entity20 for a split and raised concerns that the inquiry is conducted free of political influence			1
this is being conducted by blue blooded investment bank @entity74 and fund manager @entity75			2
lord @entity34 has led calls to split @entity5 into a ' good ' bank to boost lending to the economy and a ' bad bank ' , which will house all its toxic assets and loans @entity6 said : ‘ it is crucial that @entity74 approach this important work with a good deal of independence of mind			1
no obstacles would be put in the way of a full examination of all aspects of such as split			0
’ dismissing one of the main arguments voiced by opponents of the break up , he said : ‘ taking the ‘ bad assets ’ into a publicly owned entity at their true value does nothing to alter the underlying position of the economy , the public sector ’s net worth , or the future burden of taxation			0
’ he added : ‘ the chancellor ’s review also needs to examine whether , over time , the taxpayer may in fact be better off as a result of the split			2
’ it is thought that @entity74 ’s independent inquiry has produced little evidence so far that @entity5 is being restricted from lending by its toxic assets			0
@entity5 recently posted a profit of £ 1.4 billion in the first half of the year , rebounding from a £ 1.7 billion loss in the same period last year			0
in doing so it made two consecutive quarters of profit this year for the first time since the financial crisis			0
but almost five years on from its £ 45.5 billion bail out , taxpayers are still sitting on a £ 15.6 billion loss as the share price has slumped			0
the bank has also had to fend off criticism that it has been starving small businesses of loans and recently launched an independent inquiry to investigate the allegations			0
both @entity20 and @entity137 had indicated that they wanted to sell @entity5 back to the private sector before the 2015 general election			0
but the @entity141 is thought to be increasingly resigned to the fact that this will not happen			0
earlier this month business secretary @entity143 warned that it is ‘ pretty unrealistic ’ that taxypayer ’s 81pc stake in @entity5 will be sold off within the next five years .			0

@entity6 , chair of banking commission , said it was ' matter of urgency '
letter was signed by all ten members of the @entity30
