amid the fuss about @entity3 ’s return to @entity4 , @entity0 was forgotten			1
at least , he was until the 34th minute when the former @entity6 midfielder appeared unmarked to head @entity7 into the lead			2
a less popular goalscorer it would have been hard to find inside @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
@entity0 used to play for their fierce city rivals and returned to spoil their first @entity16 home game in six years			1
@entity0 ( second right ) proved the matchwinner for @entity7 , scoring the only goal in the 34th minute with a towering header at @entity12 @entity0 's goal at @entity12 on tuesday night would have been doubly - sweet for the @entity22 , who joined @entity7 from their bitter rivals @entity6 @entity0 ( second left ) is congratulated by @entity25 ( centre ) and the rest of his @entity7 team - mates after giving @entity7 the lead @entity12 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity30 7 ; @entity31 6 , @entity32 5.5 ( @entity33 63 , 6 ) , @entity34 5 , @entity35 5 ; @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 , @entity38 6 ( @entity39 81 ) ; @entity40 6.5 ( @entity41 81 ) , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6			1

@entity71 : @entity0 referee : @entity73 ( @entity74 ) attendance : 40,734 for @entity7 it was a vital goal , giving them a grip on a game they had dominated without managing to punish @entity12 , with @entity80 among those guilty of wastefulness , although not to the same degree as @entity57			1
@entity0 stepped forward to score his second of the season and his first @entity16 goal for the club he re-joined in january for £ 21million			1
it clinched @entity7 three points and issued a reminder of how critical the tall @entity22 has become to @entity3 ’s team			1
while @entity80 and @entity68 take acclaim for their work in front of goal , @entity0 supplies the midfield power which allows them to attack with such freedom			1
amid all the fuss about @entity80 ’s strike - rate and hamstrings and @entity68 ’s jinking dribbling skills , @entity0 is easily overlooked			1
here was the perfect moment to hail his contribution for he is every bit as important as the goals of @entity80 or the jinking runs of @entity68			2
@entity12 were very disappointing until they went behind			2
they appeared to freeze but generated more urgency and purpose in the second half , when @entity7 ’s defensive unit had to work to protect the lead			2
@entity0 weighed in with some of the more familiar unsung stuff , eating up the miles , disrupting the game ’s rhythms , winning the ball and the @entity119 moved to the top of @entity121 with back - to - back ties next against @entity123 of @entity124 , who drew at @entity126 on tuesday night			1
‘ we had to win , ’ said captain @entity55 after his 100th @entity16 appearance			2
‘ it puts us in control again			0
’ @entity43 and @entity39 both went close in a closing phase which had no right to be as nervy as it was for @entity7			1
they squandered the chances to win comfortably , starting in the second minute when @entity80 was released by @entity59			1
@entity80 stormed clear on goal with oodles of time , perhaps too much time , and opted for a low shot which @entity30 saved with his left foot			2
@entity30 went on to perform brilliantly and @entity3 strode into his penalty area at the final whistle to offer his hand			2
unlike @entity148 boss @entity147 and his sidekick @entity149 , @entity146 ’s no 1 shook it			2
‘ i ’m not going to repeat what i said because the words would be censored , ’ said the @entity7 boss			2
‘ it was something about spoiling the night			0
’ @entity80 ( right ) had a glorious chance to put @entity7 ahead in their @entity16 group match at @entity12 , but he saw his shot saved by @entity30 the @entity74 international reacts after missing a guilt - edge chance to put the @entity160 ahead when clean through on goal after two minutes of the match @entity7 should have been in front soon after but @entity57 ( right ) inexplicably dragged his shot wide when teed up by @entity68 @entity7 boss @entity3 cut a frustrated figure as his side threw away early opportunities to score at the @entity11 the match saw @entity7 face a familiar opponent in winger @entity43 ( right ) who is on loan at @entity12 from @entity171 rivals @entity172 @entity43 and @entity3 shared brief pleasantries as the game unfolded on tuesday night in the @entity176 capital after thwarting @entity80 , @entity30 frustrated @entity57 , who tried to sidle past him but the keeper scrambled across the turf to smother his shot			1
he saved again from @entity57 , a more routine catch from a header after @entity34 , who endured a torrid night , had been dispossessed , and again , to keep out a low strike from the edge of the box			1
it was shaping up like the @entity186 tie against @entity187 when @entity57 had a dozen shots and could not score			2
@entity189 through the first - half he managed to screw an absolute sitter horribly wide			0
@entity3 spun towards the bench , throwing his hands in despair			0
he knew @entity7 must score during this dominant period			0
the chance was made by @entity68 , who sped past @entity34 and picked out @entity57 , arriving from deep , completely unmarked			0
all he had to do was roll the ball into the net but somehow he missed the target			0
@entity59 ( centre ) wasted another glorious chance to double @entity7 's lead , seeing his shot saved by @entity30 ( right ) when through on goal early in the second half @entity43 's ( right ) influence grew in the second half as @entity12 pressed for an equaliser against the 2012 winners @entity12 felt they should have had a penalty in the 68th minute when @entity40 ( right ) fell under a challenge from @entity25 ( left ) @entity80 was unceremoniously fouled by defender @entity32 when charging through on goal against the @entity176 side referee @entity212 ( far left ) booked the @entity12 defender ( centre ) for the challenge - who had to be carried off on a stretcher as a result of his foul @entity7 wastefulness kept @entity12 in the game and @entity51 had them drilled to break at pace and numbers			1
@entity52 was a bystander for much of the first - half but alert to save from @entity42 when he needed to be			0
pressure was eased by @entity0 , when the @entity22 found space in a crowded goalmouth to apply a firm header to a free - kick delivered by @entity25 and looped over @entity30 into the far corner			1
there were similarities to the winner scored by @entity53 in the @entity235 final against @entity6 , when @entity0 was on the beaten team			0
@entity7 had a lead and went after the second , but it was no easier to acquire			0
@entity32 blocked from @entity80 , soon after the break , and @entity59 was unable to beat @entity30 when clean through on goal			1
@entity43 cut a frustrated figure as @entity12 failed to find a way to break down the @entity7 defence in their @entity16 clash @entity3 celebrated victory at the full - time whistle as his @entity160 ' side move top of @entity121 on four points after two matches @entity25 ( centre ) posted a picture on his @entity254 account with his @entity7 team - mates celebrating on the way back to @entity257 after the match @entity259 relaxed as @entity7 top @entity121 another run by @entity80 was brutally halted by @entity32 , who managed to injure himself in the process			1
it might have been interpreted as a red - card foul by the last defender , but the referee gave him the benefit of the doubt and the centre - half left on a stretcher with a yellow			0
‘ it ’s understandable , no problem , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ it is a young team , young players , a big match for them			0
there was some frustration because we controlled most parts of the game			0
the game was hard but correct			0
’ @entity12 summoned some quality in the second half			0
they were spirited and much more threatening and almost found a way back into the game			0
@entity43 crashed his best chance into the site - netting from an angle and curled another close , while @entity39 flashed a header wide			1
@entity7 survived the scares and are well placed to win the group			0
‘ we can control our destiny , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ we play two games against @entity123 and if we manage six points that would be 10 and job done			0

@entity0 proved @entity7 's matchwinner with a towering header on 34 minutes in @entity146
the match was @entity12 's first home @entity16 game in six years
@entity80 , @entity57 and @entity59 all missed guilt - edge chances at the @entity11
@entity3 's side move top of @entity121 on four points , while @entity12 are bottom on one
blues faced a familiar *foe* in @entity12 's @entity43 who is on loan from @entity171 rivals @entity172
