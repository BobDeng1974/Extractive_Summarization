@entity1 's highest court threw out on friday a suit challenging the proposed pathway of the @entity4 , putting the decision to approve or deny a permit to build the conduit squarely on the shoulders of president @entity9 and his administration			1
the @entity11 and the @entity12 had used the outstanding court case as cover to indefinitely block new construction on the transnational oil transportation system owned by company @entity17			1
with the legal matter resolved , president @entity9 must decide once and for all whether to allow @entity17 to proceed as planned on building the @entity21 portion of the pipeline			1
a @entity1 court threw out this morning a lawsuit challenging the proposed route of the @entity4 , putting the decision squarely on the @entity9 administration 's shoulders president @entity9 met on wednesday with secretary of state @entity30 , left , vice president @entity31 , center left , and national security adviser @entity33 , right , in the @entity34			1
it is now up to @entity30 's @entity11 to decide whether pipeline construction can proceed or to the @entity12 to sign congressional legislation giving the project the green light if given the go ahead by the @entity43 government , the @entity21 portion of the pipeline would travel from @entity44 , @entity45 to @entity46 , @entity1 , by way of @entity48 and @entity49			1
from there it extends down to the @entity43 ' southern border , splitting off in @entity53 to come to a head in @entity55 and @entity56 , @entity57			0
@entity9 has already said he would veto bipartisan legislation poised to pass in @entity59 giving the @entity21 portion of the project the green light			1
however that veto threat was partly predicated on the uncertain route of the pipeline and the @entity12 would n't commit this week to issuing a blanket rejection of @entity4			1
' once that is resolved , that should speed the completion of the evaluation of that project , ' @entity12 press secretary @entity67 told reporters on tuesday			2
a spokesman for the president confirmed on friday , though , that the president 's position remains unchanged			2
' regardless of the @entity1 ruling today , the @entity12 bill still conflicts with longstanding executive branch procedures … and if presented to the president , he will veto the bill , ' @entity9 spokesman @entity78 said today , per @entity84			1
the president appeared skeptical at a press conference last month of @entity4 backers ' claims that a new segment of pipeline would lead to a significant drop in gas prices and large scale job creation			1
' it ’s very good for @entity45 oil companies and it ’s good for the @entity45 oil industry			0
but it ’s not going to be a huge benefit to @entity43 consumers			0
it ’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to @entity43 consumers , ' @entity9 told reporters			0
' i ’ve just tried to give this perspective because i think there ’s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the @entity43 economy , and it ’s hard to see on paper where they ’re getting their information from , ' he said			0
@entity9 is also uneasy about the amount of carbon pollution the pipeline would indirectly bring about , the @entity12 has said			1
' as we see weather disasters worsen , as we see in the form of wildfires or more severe hurricanes , that only adds to costs			0
so the president does harbor those concerns , ' @entity67 said earlier this week			0
this overall map of the proposed 1,179 mile crude oil pipeline shows the already built portion of @entity4 as well as the @entity21 portion currently under review by the @entity11			1
the xl pipeline is denoted by the dashed blue line another factor in the @entity12 's decision to wave off @entity59 ' attempts to fast track @entity4 is that ' there ’s already a well - established process in place to consider whether or not infrastructure projects like this are in the best interest of the country			1
' in previous administrations when pipeline projects like this were considered they were evaluated by the @entity11 and other experts in the administration to reach a determination about whether or not that project was in the national interest , ' @entity67 said earlier this week			1
the @entity12 said today that it would wait for @entity11 to finish its review before @entity9 comes to his own conclusion			1
' the president believes the process should unfold at the @entity11 , ' @entity156 told reporters traveling with @entity9 today on his trip to @entity161			1
the @entity11 has been reviewing @entity4 since 2008			1
in 2012 president @entity9 rejected the initial route put forward for the xl pipeline and sent @entity17 back to the drawing board			1
@entity1 gov. @entity166 ok 'd those plans the following january but a legal challenge put pipeline construction in limbo for the last two years			2
at the beginning of 2014 , the @entity11 issued an environmental impact study that concluded that the pipeline would have minimal effects on carbon pollution			2
it also found that even if the pipeline were permanently shutdown , the crude oil it carries would most likely be transported through other means , then burned , and the same carbon emissions would eventually end up in the atmosphere one way or another			0
state was in the middle of conducting a 90 - day review period , in which other government agencies could weigh in on the department 's report , when it suddenly put a halt to the procedure , citing the legal battle in @entity1			2
' the @entity194 decision could lead to changes in the pipeline route , and it ’s important to have that information and better understand that route , because it could have implications for environmental , socioeconomic and cultural impacts of the pipeline , ' a @entity11 official told reporters during an april conference call , according to the @entity206			2
it was the second time the federal agency had delayed the process , having postponed a decision in 2011 until after the next year 's elections			0
it attributed that hold up to the dispute over the route as well			0
@entity216 sen. @entity215 , a @entity218 sponsor of the long - stalled @entity4 pipeline bill , flanked by @entity221 sen. @entity220 to his right , makes his plea at the @entity225 markup on the controversial project on thursday			1
with @entity215 's help , @entity225 @entity227 may be able to rally enough of their colleagues across the aisle to overturn a presidential veto the government agency must now move forward with its review and secretary of state @entity30 , and ultimately , the president , must determine whether or not to side with environmentalists , who strongly oppose @entity4 , and @entity237 on @entity238 begging him to allow construction on the final portion of the pipeline to begin			1
@entity59 has tried to needle the president for months to give his blessing to @entity4			2
a dozen @entity237 wrote to @entity9 last year warning that if his administration did n't speed up its review they would be left with little choice but to intervene legislatively			0
last month a bill approving @entity4 died in the upper chamber after it fell a single vote short of overcoming a procedural hurdle			0
the lead sponsors of the bill , @entity255 sen. @entity254 , a @entity227 , and @entity216 sen. @entity215 , a @entity256 , now say they have the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation			0
and while they still have more lobbying to do , the pair believes they may be able to persuade enough @entity237 to support the bill to cancel out a presidential veto			0
the @entity225 is expected to take a preliminary head count on the measure on monday and will likely take a final vote early next week			2
the @entity12 approved @entity4 on a vote of 266 - 153 this afternoon , attracting the support of 28 @entity218 members , more than twice as many as voted for it in december			1
but nearly four dozen @entity237 would have to sign onto the legislation to defy @entity9 's promised veto			2
@entity238 @entity227 attempted on friday to pressure @entity9 to change his mind , with members demanding that he stop making ' excuses			0
' senate majority leader @entity276 said the @entity1 decision provides the ' perfect opportunity ' for @entity9 to ' reverse his veto threat			2
' house speaker @entity280 said in a statement that he president ' is now out of excuses for blocking the @entity4 pipeline and the thousands of @entity43 jobs it would create			2
' ' finally , it ’s time to start building , ' the @entity227 leader said			0
newly minted @entity290 chair @entity289 of @entity291 said @entity9 's ' had six years to approve a project that will increase @entity43 energy supplies and create closer ties with our nearest ally and neighbor , and he ’s refused to act			2
' regardless of whatever new excuse he may come up with , @entity59 is moving forward , ' she said			0
for their part , progressive groups hammered @entity227 today over the zeal with which they have pursued @entity4 legislation and again urged @entity9 to reject @entity17 's permit			1
' the eleventh vote by @entity305 to force approval really begs the question : why are @entity227 so obsessed with @entity4 ? ' @entity308 , senior campaigner at @entity309 , said in statement this afternoon			0
' it 's not about gas prices or jobs , it primarily benefits @entity45 oil companies at the cost of @entity43 land , water , and scorching our climate , ' he claimed			0
' the @entity305 work for the @entity43 people , not @entity45 oil companies			0
it 's time they start acting like it and drop their obsessive @entity4 fetish			0
' @entity326 , @entity327 director at the @entity328 , said today 's ruling clears the way for @entity9 - and only @entity9 - to decide whether the ' dirty tar sands pipeline is in the national interest			1
' ' the ruling does n’t make it right for the @entity59 to act as a permitting agency , usurp presidential authority or short - circuit the president ’s obligation to decide whether the pipeline is good for the country , ' she said			0
it needs to be denied			0

@entity1 's highest court threw out on friday a suit challenging the proposed pathway of the @entity21 portion of the pipeline
the @entity11 and the @entity12 had used the outstanding court case as cover to block construction on the oil transportation system
president @entity9 must decide once and for all whether to allow @entity4 to proceed
the @entity12 passed legislation green lighting the project today and the @entity225 will vote on it next week ; the pipeline is still under review at @entity11
