@entity0 was very lucky to avoid being sent for an early shower during @entity4 's @entity3 semi-final against @entity5 on tuesday evening after his clear stamp on @entity7			1
but the provocative @entity4 striker did n't escape the punishment on social media as the @entity11 reacted to his aggressive behaviour at @entity13			1
it was n't only can who felt the sharp end of @entity0 's studs , as the @entity18 continued his rampage with a second stamp on his defensive tormentor @entity22			1
@entity4 striker @entity0 appears to stamp on @entity7 's right leg during the match at @entity13 @entity0 and can clash after the incident , which occurred close to @entity4 boss @entity27 @entity0 shares a name with a chain of coffee shops so he was pictured filling up loyalty cards with stamps costa as a stamp collector - simple gag but effective nonetheless as @entity38 boss @entity27 chose to sidestep any definitive answers surrounding the incidents , viewers of the ill - tempered contest put their creative heads together to produce some amusing results			1
the obvious choices were all there to see , with various viewers using the 26 - year - old 's name similarity to coffee shop chain @entity48 as an opportunity to mock him up with loyalty stamp cards - one tweeter even claimed they would be able to get a free coffee thanks to all of @entity0 's stamps			2
others photoshopped him in a wrestling ring and also on the front of a first class stamp while he was also mocked up as a collector by @entity62 user @entity61			0
bookmaker @entity64 was also tweeting about the @entity48 stamp			0
having scored 17 goals already this season for the @entity38 , he 's shown he has what it takes to let the football do the talking			0
yes , he has an aggressive side , which is handy in the @entity74 , but let 's hope he can start stamping his authority in a more positive manner after tonight 's bad behaviour			0
one football fan chose to depict @entity0 as a @entity81 wrestler whose finishing move involved a stamping motion one fan went the extra mile to mock up a full size first class @entity89 stamp with the @entity4 striker 's face			2

@entity0 was not sent off against @entity5 after a stamp on @entity94
*referee* @entity96 missed the incident and another apparent stamp
however the @entity18 did n't avoid the @entity62 *backlash* as he was memed
