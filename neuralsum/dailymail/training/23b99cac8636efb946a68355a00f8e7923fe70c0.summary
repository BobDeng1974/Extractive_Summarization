by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 30 january 2013 challenges : @entity2 , @entity3 giving more benefits to poor families will not address child poverty because too many irresponsible parents will spend it on alcohol or drugs , @entity3 has warned			1
the @entity2 said parental addiction – not family income – had emerged as the main factor in determining a child ’s life chances			1
he insisted that the last government ’s strategy of spending more than £ 170billion in additional welfare payments had failed comprehensively			0
mr @entity3 said giving the family ‘ an extra pound in benefits ’ can even push them further into difficulty if the cash is used to fuel a parent ’s dependency on alcohol or drugs			1
in a speech today , he will suggest broader ways of calculating child poverty – including whether or not parents are in work , educational failure , family breakdown , problem debt , gambling and poor health			1
the government is also planning new back - to - work programmes tailored specifically for benefit claimants with alcohol and drug problems			2
in remarks ahead of the speech , the @entity2 said @entity50 had ‘ spent an unprecedented amount of money in their pursuit of child poverty targets , with some £ 170billion paid out in tax credits alone ’ – but still missed their aim of halving child poverty			1
‘ good intentions failed to translate into effective policies because the root causes of poverty can not be solved by simply giving people a few more pounds in their pocket each week , ’ he said			2
‘ money matters , of course , and must remain central to our understanding of what it means to be in poverty			1
but there is now a broad agreement that simply calculating whether people sit above or below the relative income line does not do enough to reflect the reality of their lives			2
‘ how we measure poverty needs to expose the real challenges we face – however ugly and uncomfortable			2
’ @entity50 enshrined its measure of poverty – 60 per cent of median earnings – in law , and used tax credits to try to push families just over the line			1
it set a target to reduce the number of children living in relative income poverty to 1.7million by 2010/11 , but only got the figure down to 2.3million			1
@entity50 fail : mr @entity3 , pictured on sunday , said that the previous government 's welfare benefits strategy has done more harm than good to claimants in the @entity93 ’s first year there was a reduction of 300,000			1
ministers admit this was not because incomes rose for the poorest , but was largely due to a significant drop in the median income , demonstrating the absurdity of the current measure			2
claimants of means - tested state benefits should be paid through cards that stop them spending on gambling or alcohol , a left - leaning think - tank said yesterday			2
pre-paid cards would increase equality by giving claimants a similar ability to use shops as people with chip - and - pin bank cards , the @entity109 report said			0
they would encourage responsible money management , and reward saving			0
families on benefits could put a weekly cap on their spending or hold back a set figure from their money to pay rent			1
they could also have cards that would not work in betting shops or on gambling websites , or let them buy drink			0
@entity133 mp @entity132 has tabled a ten minute rule bill that would stop benefit cash being used to buy cigarettes , alcohol , subscription tv or for gambling			0
‘ it is trying to help the poorest in society be able to manage their money better , ’ he told @entity141 ’s today programme			0
the @entity93 has agreed to tear up @entity50 ’s definition , insisting that basing it purely on a crude measure of family income is perverse , when other factors can be just as critical in determining children ’s life chances			0
mr @entity3 said government polling showed people think having a parent addicted to drugs or alcohol is the most important factor for a child growing up in poverty			1
he added : ‘ i ’m by no means saying that every child in poverty will have drug or alcohol addicted parents			1
but we know the havoc that living with addiction can cause			0
’ mr @entity3 said @entity50 ’s approach was a ‘ vicious trap ’ and had left ‘ disturbing number ’ of people trapped in poverty			1
‘ there are around 100,000 people claiming sickness benefits whose illness is primarily down to their drug or alcohol addiction , ’ he said			2
‘ of these , 23,000 have been claiming incapacity benefits for a decade or more			0
instead of propping people up on benefits , we need to tackle the root cause of their hardship – the drug addiction itself			0
’ one pilot scheme for addicted claimants will offer a financial incentive to support addicts who are in rehab , using work as a ‘ stepping stone to recovery ’			0
the second will bring in specialists to help others back to work			0
@entity198 accuse the government of changing the goalposts to mask the impact of its austerity policies			0
and @entity204 , chief executive of the @entity205 , said : ‘ children are much more likely to be in poverty today because they have a parent who is a security guard , care worker or cleaner than a drug addict or “ feckless ”			0
‘ it ’s right that the government focuses on the damage that parental addiction can do to children , but a mistake to mix that up with poverty			1

parental addiction , not income , is main reason for child poverty
even ' an extra pound ' could push families further into difficulties if money is spent on drugs and alcohol , @entity3 warns
