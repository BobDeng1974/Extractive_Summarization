@entity0 are listed by many bookmakers as favourites to win the @entity3 this season – rated above even @entity5 and @entity6			1
the @entity8 champions are unbeaten in 22 matches in all competitions , so what price @entity11 to stop the @entity14 juggernaut on tuesday night in order to keep their own @entity17 hopes alive ? it is certainly a daunting task as you can see			1
@entity21 takes a look at six reasons why @entity0 are almost impossible to beat			1
@entity0 players celebrate @entity25 ( left ) scoring against @entity26 on saturday 1			1
they have the best goalkeeper in the world @entity30 has taken the @entity32 position to new levels , becoming the ultimate sweeper - keeper that every other top club in the world is trying to replicate			0
not only is he like an extra defender if teams try to get in behind the back - four , he is utterly commanding on set - pieces , successfully claiming 95 % of the corners , free - kicks and crosses he went for in the @entity44 last season			0
winner of the @entity46 for being the best goalkeeper at the last @entity48 , he has repaid every penny of the £ 18million it cost @entity0 to lure him from @entity52 in 2011 , @entity0 goalkeeper @entity30 pulls off a save during his side 's 4 - 0 victory against @entity26 on saturday 2			1
they have the best manager in the world @entity59 is the only serious rival to @entity14 's crown , and @entity63 fans will recall how his @entity6 side totally humiliated @entity59 's real 5 - 0 in the famous 2010 @entity65			1
@entity14 gave the world tiki - taka at @entity6 , winning the @entity3 twice , and has reinvented himself in @entity68 , responding to heavy defeats against @entity5 last season by giving his side greater physical strength through summer signings @entity25 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 – without losing any of the flair			2
@entity11 keep a close eye on @entity14 's tactical reformation in case he shows any interest in succeeding @entity82 in 18 months time			1
@entity14 , pictured in his pre-match press conference , has experienced huge success as a manager 3			0
they are proven winners @entity0 have won the last two @entity88 titles and are already seven points clear this season after an unbeaten start to the campaign			1
besides that , six of their team – @entity30 , @entity96 , @entity97 ( currently injured ) , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 won the @entity101 with @entity102 this summer			0
@entity98 scored the only goal in the final against @entity105 and 2010 @entity101 winner @entity74 was added to an already star - studded @entity0 squad in the last transfer window			2
six of @entity0 's players helped @entity102 lift the @entity101 in @entity110 last summer 4			2
@entity111 @entity113 's spectacular late strike against @entity114 at @entity115 in 2010 took the @entity8 through to the @entity3 final on the away goals rule			2
last season , they visited @entity120 twice and enjoyed highly satisfactory results on both occasions			0
goals from @entity124 , @entity99 and @entity113 earned them a deserved 3 - 1 win at @entity11 in the group stages			1
and they returned to the north - west for a quarter - final against @entity114 , earning a 1 - 1 draw in the first leg at @entity115 that set up an easy second - leg win			1
@entity99 scores in @entity0 's 3 - 1 win against @entity11 at the @entity134 last season 5			1
they have new attacking teeth if there was one criticism about @entity14 's teams , it was they occasionally over-played and did n't make their possession superiority count in terms of goals			0
you could n't say that about @entity0 this season			0
they have scored 31 goals in 12 @entity44 games and conceded only three			0
at the weekend , they won 4 - 0 away to @entity151 with @entity99 scoring a hat - trick and @entity154 star @entity153 also netting			1
those @entity0 fans who complained last season the team was less exciting under @entity14 than his predecessor @entity157 have been silenced			0
their last three away games have yielded 14 goals , including seven at @entity160 in their last @entity3 fixture outside @entity68			2
the signing of @entity25 , pictured celebrating against @entity26 , has improved @entity0 's attack 6			2
they have @entity166 know - how @entity113 was a @entity168 title winner at @entity169 , and has improved immeasurably since then			0
if @entity171 and @entity172 are the best two players in the world , the @entity170 is considered by many to be the third - best on current form			0
@entity74 won the @entity3 with @entity178 and regularly topped the statistics for making the most tackles in matches , beside being an excellent playmaker			0
@entity96 had one unhappy season at @entity11 , starting only 14 @entity168 games , but knows the stadium well			2
and on the bench is @entity187 , who spent nine seasons as a @entity178 player			0
bayern duo @entity74 ( left ) and @entity96 ( right ) both have @entity168 experience winger @entity113 enjoyed plenty of success during his days as a @entity169 player under @entity59 and some crumbs of @entity196 ... @entity0 have already qualified for the knockout stages and @entity14 admits his team are n't at their best when too relaxed			0
recent history supports that , last season @entity200 forced a draw in @entity68 after losing the first leg 2 - 0 , while @entity11 actually won at the @entity203 in the group stages when @entity0 knew they could afford to lose and still progress into the last 16 as group winners .			1

@entity11 host @entity0 in the @entity3
@entity82 's men are in *desperate* need of three points at the @entity134
but @entity0 are unbeaten in 22 games and are in outstanding form
@entity0 beat @entity11 1 - 0 in their first @entity217 clash in *september*
