student @entity12 , 20 , and painter @entity13 , 34 , acquired the antique mirror when their landlord put it in a skip outside their in @entity19 , @entity20 five months ago			1
but ever since then , the pair claim they have been brought nothing but bad luck , misery , financial problems and illness			0
mr @entity13 says it has caused him to wake up screaming with ' stabbing pains ' in the night			1
spooky : only the bravest bargain hunter should bid for this ' haunted ' mirror because the current owner claims it has caused him to wake up screaming with stabbing pains in the middle of the night he said : ' the landlord said keep it , i do n't want it			1
' @entity12 , an art and design student , and his flatmate began seeing ' flickering shadows ' and ' glimpses of black darkness ' in the mirror and orbs of light in the room			1
since the walnut mirror was painted metallic silver by @entity13 two months ago , the flatmates began to suffer intense nightmares and their problems escalated			1
claims : student @entity12 reported seeing ' flickering shadows ' in the mirror and orbs of light in the room @entity12 woke up covered in red scratchmarks in the middle of the night last week and both have had sleepless nights which they blame on the antique			1
but if that 's the bad news , the good news is the mirror only has a few scratches and is not broken			1
they have placed the mirror on internet auction site @entity73 with a price of £ 100 but say it is ' only right ' that a potential buyer knows about the problems it may bring			1
the flatmates have had a number of bids slightly below the reserve price so far			2
and one prospective buyer is even eyeing up the mirror as a gift for an ex. @entity13 said : ' i think someone could have been murdered in front of the mirror and that 's why it has been haunting our house			2
' i do n't think it the mirror likes it since i painted it silver			2
i took it to an antique dealer who said it was worth £ 100 once and that 's why we 're asking for the price , but we would ideally like it to go to someone who has experience of the paranormal			2
' the item has attracted interest from allover the country , with 20,000 people having viewed the item so far			0
@entity12 said : ' we 've had a lot of queries from people interested in the paranormal and skeptics too			1
' i just know we do n't want it in the house anymore , but we did n't think it was fair to sell it without warning people			0
' the mirror is described as a ' beautiful grand victorian style mirror ' which had enjoyed pride of place in the pair 's @entity20 studio apartment			2
ghostly : @entity12 says since taking ownership of the ' haunted ' mirror , he suffered bizarre scratches on the body and eerie nightmares @entity12 said : ' since the mirror was put up , everything has gone wrong			1
' a few days after we put the mirror up , both myself and my flat mate have woken in the early morning hours screaming in pain			1
' we both experienced what i can only describe as intense sharp stabbing pains throughout our bodies			1
' they would strike us both at the same time , then disappear as fast as they came			0
' originally we thought somebody was performing some kind of voodoo or black magic on us , but the mirror gives us the creeps and we started seeing strange shadows in it			1
' tough sell : bidders probably ca n't say they were n't warned if they buy this ' haunted ' mirror on ebay , which has brought the current owners misery the pair say that the radiator below the mirror stopped working despite never having problems with central heating before and that their landline no longer works and the pipes have began rattling in the flat			2
@entity12 said : ' we both feel drained of energy all the time , but if we leave the flat it makes us feel instantly better			1
' things are constantly going missing , keys , phones			0
' i went into the bathroom one morning after hearing a loud bang			0
' i found objects strewn out across the floor , and a tub of shaving foam , which had been on the other side of the room , down the toilet			0
' with my flatmate working most days , i spent a lot of time here alone in the flat			0
i became paranoid and had the uneasy feeling that i was constantly being watched			0
orbs of light ' my anxiety levels reached an all time high , and i was prescribed antidepressants by my doctor for the first time in my life			2
' while i had calmed down enough to be able to tolerate being alone in the flat , i could n't help but notice strange things happening around me			0
' i would put things down and they would dissapear			0
' when i pass the mirror , i see flickering shadows reflected in it			2
i would stand completely still and they continued , and i 'd get quick glimpses of black darkness			1
he added : ' last week i woke up at 3.30am with a pain in my lower back and bottom that felt like i 'd been burned			0
' i got up and looked in the bathroom mirror to find myself covered in deep red scratches going in all directions			0
' i have short fingernails , and after checking the bed found nothing sharp or no loose springs that would explain such a thing			0
' i have never been particularly superstitious , but just being around this mirror gives me the creeps and makes me feel sick to my stomach			0
' i would ideally like it to go to somebody who has experience with the paranormal or supernatural and knows what they are getting themselves in for .			0
