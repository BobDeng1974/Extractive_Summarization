@entity2 , also known by his real name @entity2 , said : ‘ if you do n’t vote , you do n’t count			1
it ’s only a century ago that none of us had the right to vote and we do n’t want to go back to that route			1
’ the 58 - year - old refused to say who he supported , adding : ‘ i ’m very wary of tagging my name on to supporting any of those phoney b * * * * * ds , but do n’t be like @entity4			1
’ the remarks , to the @entity25 , come after mr @entity4 sparked controversy after calling on voters to ignore the upcoming election			1
the @entity30 star and comedian told the @entity32 : ' do n't bother voting			2
stop voting stop pretending , wake up , be in reality now			1
why vote ? we know it 's not going to make any difference			1
' he added : ‘ it is not that i am not voting out of apathy			2
i am not voting out of absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies , treachery and deceit of the political class that has been going on for generations			0
’ @entity4 said mr @entity2 's experience at state school ‘ seemed to primarily be the installation of a belief system that placed his generation and class at the bottom of an immovable hierarchical structure ’			1

‘ go to town hall meetings and give them f * * * ing hell , ’ he said			0

if you do n’t start locally you ’re not going to change the world			0
’ it is not the first time mr @entity4 ’s comments have been criticised in public			2

he pointed to figures showing that ‘ older people , wealthier people , better educated people , engaged people ’ are most likely to vote , which ‘ young people , poor people , badly educated people ’ are the least			2
as a result politicians of all parties ‘ fear alienating ’ the more engaged , while choosing to ‘ ignore ’ those who do not bother voting , placing them instead in the ‘ firing line ’ for spending cuts			0
‘ paradoxically the more those who are not engaged are ignored , targeted under the austerity programme and dismissed , the more alienated and disillusioned they become			0
politicians they say " do n’t give a damn about us "			0

‘ by the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part , i was feeling really uncomfortable : the person who chooses not to vote – can not even be bothered to write ‘ none of the above ’ on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all			2
’ but @entity100 was heavily criticised by deputy prime minister @entity122 for setting a bad example			0
mr @entity122 said : ‘ he ’s a guy who gets paid £ 1million or thereabouts , paid for by taxpayers , he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics			0
