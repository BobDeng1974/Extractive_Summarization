@entity1 tickets are not just the most expensive in the world in absolute terms - at £ 28.80 on average for a ‘ cheap ’ adult seat - but take up a larger chunk of the average fan ’s wages than virtually any league globally			1
an exclusive @entity11 study of the world ’s football leagues reveals fans in only two countries , @entity16 and @entity17 , need spend a bigger portion of their weekly income to watch top - flight - football			1
and they are only dearer than the @entity1 by a whisker			2
our analysis considers the average price of a ‘ typical ’ top - flight ticket in 34 countries and weighs it against local income			0
using the most recent data , the study shows a supporter in @entity31 could buy just 14.3 tickets with a week ’s pay ( £ 411 )			1
@entity1 tickets take a larger chuck of the averga fan 's wages than almost any other league in @entity16 the average seat costs £ 12.73 , or 14.2 tickets for a week ’s pay , and in @entity17 the income is £ 140 and the average seat , according to a spokesman , is £ 10 , or just 14 tickets			1
statistics on these pages and available in full online show the extraordinary range of prices that fans pay around the world - and indicate where the beautiful game truly remains the people ’s game			2
the cheapest tickets when weighted to income are in @entity56 , where a £ 1.40 seat means the average fan could buy as many as 118 tickets with a week ’s pay			1
prices in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 are also among the most affordable			0
@entity68 ’s @entity67 is often lauded as a bargain - but 22 countries offer better value against local wages			0
a typical @entity67 seat costs £ 19.17 , meaning a fan there can buy 27 tickets with a week ’s pay			1
the study shows a supporter in @entity31 could buy just 14.3 tickets with a week ’s pay ( £ 411 ) ticket prices vary enormously within each country and even at each club			1
our average ( or ‘ typical ’ ) seat prices are either the official figure provided by each league or an average price for the cheapest available adult non-concessionary tickets from a selection of clubs in each league			2
‘ ticket pricing , especially at the top clubs , is the standout factor in order of magnitude among fans ’ concerns , ’ says @entity92 of the @entity93 ’ federation			0
‘ this is a league with money coming out of its ears , so rich from tv deals that the clubs could give every seat away for nothing and still have more money now than they did before the current tv deal			0
‘ that clubs have failed to make an impact in this area is scandalous			0
’ while the @entity1 is the most expensive to watch live , it clearly has positives that make it hugely popular at home and abroad			2
the @entity11 ’s groundbreaking in - depth study of world leagues has analysed a wide range of factors from all 34 , from income and wages , to ‘ star ’ quality and goals , attendance , talent production , trophies , calibre of managers , competitive balance and each league ’s contribution to its national game			2
@entity1 clubs have the highest average incomes in the world , at around £ 155m each , and the highest average wages , at £ 2.3m player per year			1
both these figures put the @entity1 ’s closest rival , @entity68 ’s @entity67 , in the shade , on £ 1.46m and £ 90m comparatively			1
and @entity68 are clear of the next league			0
@entity147 ’s @entity146 is indisputably home to the game ’s most stellar names — @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 — but the @entity1 is home to the most stars at the summer ’s @entity158 , 112 of them			2
the @entity67 beats the @entity1 in average attendance per match , at 42,609 for last year , but the @entity1 ( 36,695 ) had more fans overall , at 13.94m to 13m in @entity68 ’s top flight			1
with an average fan attendance of 42,609 the @entity67 boasts the highest amount in world football the @entity166 lead the way in one category — talent production			1
our study shows @entity166 clubs produce more ‘ top class ’ footballers for teams across @entity176 ’s ‘ @entity177 ’ leagues than those anywhere else in the world			1
when 118 @entity166 - produced exports to rival leagues are added to 75 international - standard players still within @entity166 , they have ‘ made ’ 193 such players			0
@entity147 ’s @entity146 ( 133 ) plus the top divisions in @entity186 ( 111 ) , @entity16 ( 103 ) , @entity68 ( 95 ) and the @entity1 ( 94 ) make up the top six producers			1
@entity147 is the best league in terms of their clubs winning ‘ continental ’ trophies over the past decade , with four @entity193 wins , and five @entity195 / @entity195 titles			0
the @entity1 is next best ( 3 @entity193 , 1 @entity196 )			2
using a similar formula to determine which league has the best calibre of managers , overall , @entity31 comes out on top because of the global and continental trophy hauls amassed collectively by @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206			2
@entity203 's trophy haul boosts the @entity1 's calibre of managers the @entity67 has the second best calibre of managers thanks to the likes of @entity212 ( above ) the @entity67 is second thanks to @entity212 , @entity214 , @entity215 and others			1
@entity147 ’s @entity146 is third and a surprise fourth place goes to @entity17 ’s @entity218 , home in 2014 to @entity158 winner @entity220 and @entity221 among an international cast of bosses			0
the @entity1 performs poorly on competitive balance , with just three different winners in a decade and a global low of five teams in the top three over a decade			0
leagues in @entity66 , @entity230 and across the @entity231 have had as many as seven different winners in a decade			0
@entity68 ’s domestic league famously assists their @entity158 - winning national team and when fan - ownership and stable finances are considered , @entity68 comes out on top in the ‘ contribution to national game ’ category			0
when all things are considered , scoring each category winner as 10 points and all other league relative to the winner , the @entity1 pips the @entity67 by a fraction , literally			0
on penalties , as it were			0

@entity1 tickets take up larger chunk of average fan 's wage than most other leagues
@entity257 study shows fans in @entity16 and @entity17 must spend larger portion of weekly wage
a supporter in @entity31 could buy just 14.3 tickets with a week 's pay ( £ 411 )
