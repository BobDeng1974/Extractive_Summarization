a baby died at just three days old of organ failure after his mother failed to control her blood sugar levels throughout her pregnancy following her struggle with her diabetes , an inquest heard			1
@entity8 was born three weeks early and had to be placed in an incubator after he was found to be ' very floppy ' and did n't cry after being born			2
he died in @entity10 three days later			2
the child 's mother @entity11 is a qualified nurse with type 1 diabetes but often forgot to provide doctors with readings of her blood sugar levels throughout her pregnancy , but said feels she is now being blamed for his death			1
she admitted she had struggled with her diabetes since being diagnosed at 24 and @entity10 @entity18 heard doctors raised concerns that her levels of blood glucose were not being monitored properly throughout her pregnancy			1
@entity8 died at three days old from multiple organ failure			1
an inquest heard his mother @entity25 , a diabetic , had failed to properly control her blood glucose which increases the risk of stillbirth and complications			1
his parents provided a picture of his treatment in an incubator at @entity10 diabetic women have an increased risk of stillbirth if they do not control their sugar levels properly			1
just before @entity8 ' birth @entity41 's blood sugar levels were almost five times what they should have been			1
the inquest heard that having poor control of her diabetes meant miss @entity11 was four times more likely to have a stillbirth or complications with her pregnancy and doctors said this meant they would have advised her against having a child			1
speaking after the inquest miss @entity11 said doctors should have advised her better			1
she said : ' i did n't get any impression that anything was wrong			0
pregnancy and diabetes in someone - i have no idea about , so why was n't i advised ? i do n't understand , you go to a clinic every week but it seems it its up to you - if that 's right , what 's the point ? miss @entity11 said she only occasionally forgot her records , not all the time			1
she said : ' i offered to go home or for someone to bring it back that day			0
it 's alright for them to say they did n't have my readings but they take an overall blood sugar every few weeks , why did n't they pick upon it ? if i was so bad why was n't anything flagged up to me ? ' if they had said at any stage ' this is serious ' not to be doing this , but nobody did			2
you go to see medical professionals because you think they are going to advise you because it 's their speciality			0
' hindsight is a wonderful thing			0
but i feel like i 'm being blamed for it all			0
if all the emphasis has to be on the mum why do you have to go and seek medical advice			0
i knew i had responsibilities but if they were saying i was so poorly and serious why was no medical doctor looking at me straight away ? ' you are supposed to bring home your baby not leave them in a mortuary			0
i do n't want to blame anyone but the emphasis seems to be blame on me			0
' miss @entity11 had admitted having diabetes had changed her life and that despite hating needles she injected herself after she found out about her condition as her blood sugar levels were twice what they should have been			1
miss @entity11 said her blood glucose levels remained controlled			1
she is pictured with partner @entity120 the nurse , who qualified in 1999 , later controlled her condition using pump therapy , an alternative to injecting herself , which released insulin into her bloodstream			2
this pump also recorded her blood sugar levels			1
the 39 - year - old unexpectedly fell pregnant with @entity8 in 2012 , with partner @entity120 , now 39 , a constable with @entity129			2
miss @entity11 discussed her blood sugar levels at joint antenatal and diabetes clinic sessions where her readings had been a little high at between five and seven , the inquest heard			1
she said she would have done anything to ensure the health of her young son and added : ' i always did what they told me , i never came out thinking i had to change anything			2
' but the inquest heard miss @entity11 , who has two older children @entity143 and @entity144 , frequently failed to bring her blood sugar records to appointments over a seven month period while she was pregnant with @entity8			1
she told professionals her levels were well controlled and satisfactory , running at between five and seven			0
however discrepancies arose after retrospective readings of her glycated haemoglobin ( @entity152 ) - a measurement which enables clinicians to get an overall picture of average blood sugar levels for the previous three months			1
miss @entity11 , told the inquest : ' any suggestion i was fabricating blood sugar levels or making them up is nonsense			1
' @entity8 was put on an incubator after he was born after doctors found he was floppy and did n't cry after birth @entity8 died of multiple organ failure and damage to his brain , caused by a lack of oxygen to the organ she accepted that she had on occasions forgotten her blood sugar diary or pump meter but would offer to go and get it , yet was told to bring it the following week			1
' i offered to go home and go back the same day , it 's one of those things which got missed , it was just an oversight , ' miss @entity11 told the inquest			1
@entity182 , consultant obstetrician at @entity183 who discussed diabetic care with miss @entity11 said : ' the most glaring risk is if you have got poor control , the event of a stillbirth is four times the likelihood of a normal pregnancy			1
it 's very easy to motivate women			2
' dr @entity195 a consultant physician said ms @entity11 's glycated haemoglobin levels were of concern			2
he said he had written to her gp expressing concerns that she had not been bringing her blood glucose record to appointments , and said they had ' never managed to achieve very good glucose control			0
' he added that he would have advised her not to get pregnant because the ' risks would be too high '			2
diabetic women can be advised against having a baby if they have poor control of their condition because of the increased risks			1
dr @entity211 a consultant in @entity213 and @entity214 at @entity215 said miss @entity11 had an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis ( @entity218 ) - which is a recognised cause of stillbirth			1
miss @entity11 , with @entity221 ' father mr @entity8 , said she did everything to ensure @entity8 was healthy he added : ' frequently she did not bring her blood glucose profile			1
without this information and records it 's very difficult to achieve control			0
@entity228 was rarely in the target range			0
overall in my view the diabetes team did all they could			0
generally her control meant it was always close to the threshold where @entity218 can occur			0
' a few weeks before @entity8 was born miss @entity11 reported blood glucose levels of between five and seven			1
but when she was admitted to hospital feeling unwell they were elevated at 25			0
she then reported feeling ill on november 26 and phoned the hospital believing she was in the early stages of labour			0
miss @entity11 said her blood sugar levels were normal and was told to get to the hospital @entity8 was born three weeks early in december and had to be delivered using forceps			1
tests showed he had high acidic levels and his blood pressure was low			0
he was diagnosed with high metabolic acidosis and was suffering from seizures and brain damage			0
@entity8 died at @entity10 at 3 days the child was placed in an incubator but died three days later from multiple organ failure and brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen , known as hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy			1
coroner @entity258 recorded a narrative verdict and said : ' the problem was that the mother was a type 1 diabetic and on her own admission said it was very difficult and a life changing illness to control and maintain			2
she accepted in the past she had problems controlling her diabetes			0
on her first check in hospital it showed worryingly high @entity152 levels			0
' the levels did come down but blood sugar levels were consistently too high			1
it is the doctors ' view they were not properly controlled for whatever reason			0
the case of a child dying , especially so young is very difficult to come to terms with or accept			0
' my feelings do go out to @entity8 ' mother and father			2
' consultant obstetrician dr @entity286 of the @entity288 for @entity289 said that after reviewing the case they would be randomly testing type 1 diabetes patients approximately every month			0
she said : ' every time i saw @entity25 , she was well controlled and said they were controlled and between four and seven and i presume she said the same to other members of the team			0
it would not be good practice to say ' i do n't believe you			0
' ' most people with poor control are actually quite up front			0
. ' every year just over 3,000 women in @entity303 with diabetes give birth â€“ about half have type 2 diabetes , which is linked to obesity , and the other half type 1			0
the condition greatly increases the risk of still birth , the baby dying shortly after labour or being born with heart problems or other defects			0
a report by the @entity318 found that babies born to women with diabetes are six times more likely to die shortly after birth than the national average			2
the infant mortality rate for pregnant women with diabetes is 17 per 1,000 compared with 2.8 per 1,000 for healthy women			2
the report , which looked at 1,700 pregnant women , also found one in ten with type 2 diabetes were taking pills to lower blood sugar			1
another 5 per cent of all pregnant women with diabetes were on statins and 2.5 per cent were on high blood pressure pills .			2

@entity8 was born early at @entity10
his mother @entity11 was diagnosed with diabetes at age of 24
the qualified nurse had struggled to control her blood sugar levels
miss @entity11 said she feels she is being blamed for her son 's death
she has asked why no doctors *intervened* to warn her of the dangers
diabetic women with poor sugar control have increased risk of stillbirth
@entity10 @entity356 heard she failed to provide accurate recordings
miss @entity11 said she did what doctors said to ensure son was healthy
when she was admitted to hospital blood sugar was higher than normal
@entity8 suffered multiple organ failure and died at just three days old
doctors said they would have advised miss @entity11 not to get pregnant *due* to her poor blood sugar control , which raises risks by four times
