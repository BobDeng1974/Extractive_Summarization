by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 14:08 est , 15 august 2013 @entity2 consumer goods company @entity1 has caused a stink with its brand of toilet freshener after @entity6 complained that it resembled their national flag			1
the yellow - and - blue @entity9 freshener has been removed from sale in eastern @entity11 after a tv advertisement aired on a @entity14 channel was seen in neighbouring @entity6			1
the advert shows the freshener that looks like the flag being put under the toilet rim			0
insulting : the toilet cleaning product bore a striking resemblance to the @entity6 national flag offensive : a yellow - and - blue @entity9 freshener caught the attention of @entity6 for all the wrong reasons this week @entity25 , @entity1 's general manager for laundry and home care products in @entity6 , said yesterday that the company had pulled the product within three days of the complaints			1
he said : ' we are very sorry if people were offended by the design of our new product ' mr @entity25 explained that the freshener was coloured yellow to represent its lemon scent and blue to symbolise water and hygiene			0
spot the difference : the @entity6 flag , left , and the tactless cleaning product , right ' a delirious idea from uncultured people , ' one angry person commented on the @entity48 clip			2
disrespect towards the @entity6 flag has become a topical problem as earlier this month authorities found that @entity53 , a bassist for @entity55 band @entity54 , had urinated on their flag during a gig in @entity58			2
a criminal probe has since been launched against him and @entity53 has been banned from visiting the country for five years			0
withdrawn : a @entity2 consumer goods company has apologised for the product after complaints from @entity6			0

toilet freshener branding bears *unfortunate* resemblance to @entity6 flag
complaints have forced @entity1 to pull advert from eastern @entity11
