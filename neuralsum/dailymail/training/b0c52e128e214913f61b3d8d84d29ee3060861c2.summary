five cups of coffee a day may keep the doctor away , according to a new government health report			1
a panel of experts from the @entity6 , which convenes every five years , did a detailed assessment of the caffeinated beverage for the first time			1
they concluded that a trusty cup of @entity12 could have various health benefits , including reduced risk of type 2 diabetes , heart disease , @entity18 's and liver cancer			0
drink up ! five cups of coffee a day may keep the doctor away , according to a new government health report the amount the report recommends drinking is three to five cups a day , while pregnant women should limit their intake to two cups a day			1
there was found to be no added benefit from exceeding these limits			0
americanos appear to be the way to go , as the panel note that high - calorie creams , milks and sugars could diminish the potential positive health effects			1
the report concludes that moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy lifestyle			1
although , individuals who do not consume java should not start consuming it for health benefits alone			0
@entity44 , a member of the @entity6 and a nutritionist at @entity46 , said the findings put a new spin on coffee , which has traditionally been panned by health experts			1
' coffee ’s good stuff , ' he told @entity53 , adding : ' i do n’t want to get into implying coffee cures cancer - nobody thinks that			1
' but there is no evidence for increased risk , if anything , the other way around			0
' the @entity6 helps the @entity64 government formulate dietary guidelines that affect millions of @entity64 diets , from school lunches to food package labels			1
the @entity64 is the one world ’s biggest consumers of coffee			1
according to a 2014 survey by @entity73 , 61per cent of @entity64 sip on a cup of the good stuff each day			1
despite the focus on coffee , the @entity76 @entity79 's latest report sticks to the basic message of the previous guidelines in 2010 : eat more fruits and vegetables and whole grains ; eat less saturated fats , salt and sugar			1
the 2015 dietary guidelines are set to be issued by the end of the year			0
eggs are ok the report says dietary cholesterol now is ' not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption			1
' this follows increasing medical research showing the amount of cholesterol in your bloodstream is more complicated than once thought			0
the committee says available evidence ' shows no appreciable relationship ' between heart disease and how much dietary cholesterol you eat , but it still recommends eating less saturated fat			0
as in previous years , the report advises limiting saturated fats to 10 percent of total calories			1
the panel does n't give a specific recommendation for how much cholesterol - or eggs - a person may eat			1
watch the added sugar added sugars should be around 200 calories a day - about the amount in one 16 - ounce sugary drink , says the advisory committee , which is made up of doctors and nutritionists			1
the recommendation is part of a larger push in recent years to help consumers isolate added sugars from naturally occurring ones like those in fruit and milk			2
added sugars generally add empty calories to the diet			0
@entity64 now get about 13 per cent of their calories from added sugar , or 268 calories a day , the committee says			2
older children , adolescents and young adults generally take in more			0
the committee recommends ten per cent , which is ' a target within reach , ' says @entity144 , a @entity145 professor of nutrition who served on the panel			2
sugary drinks should be replaced with water instead of those with low - calorie sweeteners ; there 's not enough evidence those drinks can help with weight loss , the committee advises			0
a softer approach on salt sodium adds up quickly			0
a turkey sandwich and a cup of soup can average about 2,200 milligrams			0
that 's just under the committee 's recommendation of 2,300 milligrams a day for all people , even those most at risk for heart disease			2
the 2010 dietary guidelines had recommended those at risk for heart disease limit sodium to 1,500 milligrams			0
the new report said lowering to that amount can still be helpful for some			2
but the new advice follows a 2013 report by the @entity178 that said there is no good evidence that eating less than 2,300 milligrams a day of sodium offers benefits			1
with the average @entity64 eating more than 3,400 milligrams daily , the panel recommends at least trying to reduce sodium intake by 1,000 milligrams a day if the goals are unattainable			1
@entity186 , a member of the panel and a professor at @entity145 , said the new recommendation ' puts the focus where it should be			2
' get sodium intake down , and fine - tune the numbers as more evidence comes in			0
eat a plant - based diet the panel recommends eating more vegetables , fruits , whole grains , legumes , nuts and seeds			2
a plant - based diet is ' more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact ' than the current @entity64 diet , which is high in meat			0
the report stops short of telling people not to eat meat , saying ' no food groups need to be eliminated completely to improve sustainability outcomes			2
' overall , the panel advises a diet lower in red and processed meat , and in a footnote says lean meats can be part of a healthy diet			2
the @entity219 criticized the report , saying the health benefits of lean meat should be ' a headline , not a footnote			0
' the meat recommendations in particular may prompt pushback from @entity227			0
last year , @entity228 noted the panel 's interest in the environment and directed agriculture secretary @entity232 ' to only include nutrition and dietary information , not extraneous factors ' in final guidelines .			0

a panel of experts from the @entity6 , which convenes every five years , did a detailed assessment of the caffeinated beverage for the first time
they recommend drinking three to five cups a day or 400 mg
for pregnant women , the report suggests limiting coffee consumption to two cups a day
