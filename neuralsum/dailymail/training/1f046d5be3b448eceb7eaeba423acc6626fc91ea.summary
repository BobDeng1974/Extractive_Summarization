by @entity0 published : 13:30 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 17:54 est , 2 september 2013 @entity2 's militant postal union yesterday warned of ‘ inevitable ’ strikes as the dispute over plans to privatise @entity6 becomes increasingly bitter			1
the @entity7 said a strike is ‘ inevitable ’ unless a deal is agreed between its members and the @entity6			1
despite the union ’s upcoming ballot , the @entity11 said it will not alter its decision to sell shares in @entity6 in this financial year			1
strike threat : the @entity7 will be voting on potential industrial action this month , with its leaders saying a strike is ' inevitable ' the @entity6 said industrial action , or the possibility of disruption , was damaging to the business , especially in the run - up to @entity26 , which is the busiest time for the company			1
the ballot will take place on this month and will see 125,000 of @entity7 members balloted over pay , jobs , pensions and the impact of any sell - off of the @entity6 , with industrial action possible from october 10			1
the @entity37 today expressed its disappointment that the @entity7 are set to ballot for strike , adding that industrial action ‘ is n’t necessary			1
’ ‘ the @entity7 leadership are standing between their members and a generous pay offer of 8.6 per cent over three years , which is more than teachers , nurses and our armed forces , who have had pay increases capped at 1 per cent , ’ a @entity43 spokesman said			0
going for the vote : @entity55 , deputy general secretary of the @entity7 , says his members are at a breaking point ‘ action taken by the @entity7 will not alter the government 's decision to sell shares in @entity6 in this financial year			1
‘ @entity63 decided over two years ago that selling shares in @entity6 was the right thing to do to secure @entity6 's future and protect the six - day - a - week universal postal service			2
‘ a successful , financially sustainable @entity6 with access to private capital is in the best interests of the workforce and all users of the universal service			0
’ @entity55 , @entity7 deputy general secretary , said his union members had teached a ‘ breaking point ’ and accused @entity6 of ‘ relishing ’ in the prospect of privatisation			1
‘ @entity6 continues to prepare for privatisation with relentless rounds of budget cuts in offices across the @entity2			2
' there is no understanding that the pace of change can really only be led by how hard people can work , and @entity7 members are being driven to absorb absences , carry increasing amounts of mail and work harder than is possible in many cases			2
‘ we have reached breaking point , particularly in delivery offices , and the culture has to change			0
’ it will be the first national postal ballot since a pay and conditions dispute in 2009			0
the union said it had rejected a below - inflation pay offer linked to accepting major changes to working conditions and pensions			0
a number of local disputes have broken out , with the union warning that budget cuts are stretching workers ‘ to the limit ’ and 96 per cent of its members recently voted against privatisation			0
a similar percentage even said they would be prepared to boycott delivering competitors ' mail			0
@entity6 managers in the @entity116 union have also voted strongly against the planned sell - off			1
@entity7 members working in @entity118 will not be involved in the ballot , although they have been taking strike action in a separate row over closures , jobs and pay			1
a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 is very disappointed that the @entity7 has issued a timeline for a national ballot for industrial action , if an agreement is not reached in on - going talks			1
crippling action : @entity6 said a strike in the weeks before @entity26 , its busiest time of the year , would significantly damage the company ‘ discussions over a new three - year agreement between @entity6 and the @entity7 are continuing			1
we are committed to reaching an agreement with the @entity7 as soon as possible to give our customers and employees continued stability			0
we believe that focusing on the possibility of industrial action is inappropriate			2
‘ a ballot for strike action does not mean there will be a strike ; currently it is business as usual for @entity6			1
any industrial action , or the possibility of disruption , is damaging to our customers , and our business , especially in the run up to our busiest time , @entity26			2
‘ @entity6 operates in a very competitive market , especially in the parcels market			0
we recognise that customers have a choice and can move their business quickly			0
‘ @entity6 will do all that we can to protect our business and our customers ' mail			0
we will work hard to minimise the impact of any industrial action on our customers			2
’ @entity165 , chief economist at the @entity166 , said : ‘ strike action would be unjustified , highly irresponsible and would hit businesses hard			0
it would serve only to undermine the reputation of the @entity6 at a time when the focus should be on making the most of the privatisation process			0
’ all @entity6 and @entity176 workers in the @entity7 will be balloted from september 20 , with the result due on october 3			2
if there is a yes vote , the union would have to give seven days ' notice for strike action .			0
