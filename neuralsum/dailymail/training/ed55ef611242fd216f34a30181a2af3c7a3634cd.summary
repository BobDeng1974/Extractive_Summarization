by @entity0 last updated at 2:22 pm on 13th january 2012 do n't give this dog a bone : @entity3 gulped down the six - inch rib before his astonished owners could stop him and had to have the spare rib surgically removed a puppy got himself into a sticky situation when he pinched a six - inch @entity12 spare rib from his owner and swallowed it in one gulp			1
greedy @entity16 bull terrier @entity3 got into difficulties when the bone - which unbelievably he did n't choke on - started scratching his stomach			1
owner @entity20 , 44 , said the 15 - week - old puppy snatched the rib and swallowed it whole as he and his family sat down to a takeaway meal			1
his wife @entity25 , 35 , and sons @entity27 , 13 and @entity28 , 11 , watched in amazement as @entity3 , named after motorcycle legend @entity3 , jumped up to nab the pork rib and devoured it in seconds			1
worried that the bone would get stuck , mr @entity20 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , took @entity3 to the @entity36 the next day			1
an x-ray on january 6 revealed the large bone was scratching his stomach lining , which was starting to bleed and the pet was prepared for surgery			1
mr @entity20 said : ' how he managed to swallow such a large bone is amazing			2
how it did n't choke him or damage his aesophagus is a miracle			2
gobbled it up in one go : his owner @entity48 says @entity3 could not resist the delicious smell of the takeaway , and ignored his usual dog food to try his luck with the takeaway ' it could have easily ruptured his intestines			1
he 's lucky to be alive , a lot of things went in his favour and we 're really glad he 's still here			0
' a second x-ray showed the bone had moved towards the intestines			2
a few more hours without the operation and he would have gone , i ca n't praise the vets enough			0
' it was our first food treat of the year after @entity67 and we were looking forward to it			0
but as soon as he swallowed it i knew he was in trouble			0
' sticky spare rib : the surgeons believe if they had n't acted quickly @entity3 could have died @entity3 usually only eats his favourite chicken flavoured dried dog biscuits but mr @entity20 thinks the smell of the ribs was too much for the puppy to resist			1
he said : ' he 's our first family pet and we were astonished that he would just wolf down something like that still being so small			0
' he tends not to chew things which is maybe why he tried to eat it whole rather than nibble at it			0
' he did n't show any signs of any problems at first but the day we took him to the vets he was ill. ' @entity3 's running around fine now though , he 's made a full recovery and playing around with the family as normal			1
' companion care veterinary care assistant @entity91 said it was a very rare case that dogs of any size swallow anything quite so large			0
she said : ' poor little @entity3 swallowing an entire spare rib was a most uncommon case for us			2
' if he had not undergone immediate surgery then this would most likely have been fatal for the pup			0
' he was not at all fazed by his ordeal and we are extremely happy with his speedy recovery and fighting spirit			0
he was such a brave little puppy			0
