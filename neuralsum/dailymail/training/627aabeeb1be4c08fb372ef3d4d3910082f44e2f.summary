senator @entity0 made history on tuesday night when he became the first black senator from the @entity3 to be elected to the @entity4 by a popular election			1
sen. @entity0 , a @entity6 from @entity7 and the incumbent in his race , defeated democrat @entity10 in a landslide , with the race being called just four minutes after the polls closed			1
he became a senator in 2013 after being appointed to fill the seat of @entity16 in late 2012 , who stepped down to join a @entity6 think tank , by @entity7 governor @entity19			1
breakthrough : a victorious @entity0 makes his speech to supporters after beating challengers @entity23 and @entity10 to historic men : the only other black men to serve in the @entity4 from the @entity3 , @entity28 @entity27 ( left ) and sen. @entity29 ( right ) were both appointed to their posts and from @entity31 history : young supporters celebrate sen. @entity0 's landmark victory only nine african - americans have been elected or appointed to serve in the @entity4			1
of those nine , only three , including senator @entity0 , have been from the @entity3			2
just as shocking is the fact that the other two senators to serve from the @entity3 were sen. @entity27 , who was elected by the @entity39 in 1870 and served just over one year , and sen. @entity29 , who was also from @entity31 and served a full term beginning in 1875 after being elected by the state senate			0
that means that it took over 130 years for the next black senator to enter the @entity4			2
until tuesday however , none of these men had ever won the office as the result of a public election			0
proud mama : sen. @entity0 , who is unmarried , celebrated his victory with his mother , @entity52 ( above ) president : six of the black politicians elected to the @entity4 have come from the @entity56 , including @entity57 ( above ) , who was junior senator from @entity58 until he gained the presidency major moment : a drawing of sen. @entity27 being sworn in back in 1870 the six black senators from the @entity56 , three from @entity58 , two from @entity64 , and one from @entity66 , all assumed office as the result of a public election , beginning with @entity64 sen. @entity70 who was elected in 1967			2
the other five are sen. @entity72 , sen. @entity73 , sen. @entity74 , sen. @entity75 and , most notably , president @entity57			0
sen. @entity0 , who is unmarried and owns an insurance agency , is now one of two black senators serving in the @entity4 alongside sen. @entity75			0
he previously served in the @entity79 from 2011 to 2013 .			0

senator @entity0 , who defeated *opponent* @entity10 in a landslide , is now the first black *man* from the @entity3 to enter the @entity4 following a public election
he is also only the third black politician to serve on the @entity4 from the @entity3 , and the first in over 130 years
senator @entity0 was actually the incumbent in his race , having been appointed to the @entity4 in late 2012 by @entity7 governor @entity19
