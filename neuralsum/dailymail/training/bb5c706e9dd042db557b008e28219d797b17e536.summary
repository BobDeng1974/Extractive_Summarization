by @entity0 this month , @entity2 director @entity1 emerged from brief public hiatus with a new , softer look			1
it appears that she is attempting using her wardrobe as a tool for reinvention as she continues to experience public unfavorability in @entity10 , following charges that she helped embezzle nearly € 400 million of government funds in a fraud probe while serving as the country ’s finance minister			1
likely in an effort to soften her image to help staunch her plummeting approval ratings , @entity1 has grown out her cropped silver hair into a feminine , shoulder - length bob and has begun wearing many shades of pink			1
new look : this fall , @entity1 reemerged from a lightened public schedule with longer hair and feminine sensibility ( r ) that is legions different from her previous , politically - shaped style ( @entity29 ) she wore a light pink @entity31 suit to address the @entity32 in mid-september , and this month , a jewelled , vintage @entity31 shift to a discussion at @entity35			1
on the first day of the annual @entity37 - @entity2 meetings @entity1 chose a new pink suit , and then re-wore the rosy @entity31 suit on the following day			1
her efforts at aesthetic reinvention may be seared with motive , but placing scandal aside , it presents an example of sartorial reform for women in both diplomatic circles as well as those belonging to @entity1 ’s own peer group			1
@entity1 , 57 , has served as the director of the @entity2 since 2011			1
she took over the position from @entity53 who resigned after a @entity56 hotel maid publicly charged him with sexual assault			0
she was tasked with helping save the @entity58 from falling off a fiscal cliff , and her clothes reflected the period with somber tones and restrictive shapes			0
her hair , left in its natural silver - white tone , was consistently cut in a mannish crop that was both practical and assertive			0
while never straying far from chic accoutrements like scarves , pearls , and @entity71 bags , @entity1 still dressed with diplomatic conformities well known to the few women in her industry			1
@entity75 in pink : @entity1 sits for an interview with @entity78 during the annual @entity2 - @entity37 meetings in @entity80 on october 10 on duty : in january 2012 , @entity1 and @entity83 chancellor @entity82 both display the conservative fashion and grooming styles typical of women in political fields in 2011 , @entity1 was charged with participating in a fraud probe that paid nearly € 400 million of tax funds to @entity10 businessman @entity90			1
she was acquitted of the allegations in may but is still considered an ‘ assisted witness ’ in the case , meaning that she could be charged at a later date			2
following the acquittal , @entity1 lightened her public schedule only to reemerge in full force late last month with a longer , feminine haircut and new clothes			1
while the @entity2 would not confirm to @entity101 if @entity1 has begun working with a wardrobe stylist , such an appointment would make sense			1
seemingly overnight she has shed many of her scarves , which have been the subject of excessive social analysis , grown out her hair into a layered , shoulder - length bob , and set aside her valise of navy suits in favor of pearl - embellished , largely pink attire			0
' she has begun to subvert not only her own industry ’s standards , but those of her general age group as well ' in doing so , she has effectively begun to subvert not only her own industry ’s standards , but those of her general age group as well			1
@entity1 does not only appear hyper - feminine by diplomatic criterion			1
her hair trumps a known cultural norm for women of their late fifties to cut their hair into a cropped style as their follicle condition begins to wane with age			2
@entity130 hair , too , is often masked beneath a monthly ritual of corrective hair coloring			0
‘ i think it ’s a cultural thing that women feel after a certain point your hair should n’t be long , ’ says hairstylist @entity133 , who has a salon in @entity135 and styles @entity137 ’s hair			0
longer locks : @entity1 shows off her new hairstyle at a speech earlier this month ( @entity29 ) , which is much more feminine than her previous , signature coif ( r ) ‘ it just was n’t feminine , there was nothing feminine about it , ’ @entity133 says of @entity1 ’s old style			1
he feels that the lack of femininity is often an issue with shorter cuts in general			2
@entity157 , creative director at large for @entity158 , thinks that particularly in @entity1 ’s case the ‘ shorter nineties corporate hairdo gave her an air of competence but it was starting to look a bit passé			2
’ in layman ’s terms , @entity1 ’s more mannish haircut , paired with largely conservative attire , was in no way going to lend her an air of personability in the public eye			2
but the cultural stipulation for shorter hair has much deeper implications than what simply meets the eye			0
‘ there is the sense of long hair on a woman being out of control and that being inappropriate , ’ @entity183 , professor of fashion studies and chair of research at @entity187 says			0
‘ long hair has always symbolized femininity , and when it ’s unkempt it is directly associated with sexuality			0
’ but on a more macro level , long hair still ‘ is often perceived as not being appropriate as you age , since you are not looked at in a sexual context anymore , ’ says @entity192			0
in @entity31 : @entity1 particularly favors this pink suit by @entity31 ( @entity29 ) , which was included in the brand 's spring 2012 runway show ( r ) @entity1 ’s decision to leave her hair in its au natural grey state is also unconventional			1
typically , many women feel pressured to dye their hair in order to improve their perception in the workplace			0
but according to @entity157 , ‘ grey equals gravitas			0
’ indeed , short hairstyles are practically de rigueur in @entity1 ’s age group			1
in diplomatic circles , the short cut ( favored by @entity1 ’s contemporaries including @entity82 and @entity137 ) is a key part of the industry ’s unwritten , but socially enforced grooming standards that masculinize female politicians ’ appearance			1
' @entity1 ’s decision to also broaden her fashion appeal could work out to be her greatest diversionary tactic yet ' women within the political arena tend to avoid subscribing to fashion at many costs , as a simple change in grooming or attire can lead to a distraction within the press ( take @entity232 ’s bangs as example )			2
so it makes sense that hair aside , @entity1 ’s decision to also broaden her fashion appeal could work out to be her greatest diversionary tactic yet			2
in the last year she has gone from being named 2012 ’s most loved @entity10 female political figure , to many of the country ’s news outlets calling for her imprisonment			0
@entity242 -- often considered one of the more powerful means of personal articulation -- is perhaps the quickest , most obvious way for @entity1 to try and change the public ’s perception			2
but her attempt at swaying popular opinion through her appearance must be orchestrated as a carefully balanced act			0
buttoned - up : last may , @entity1 traveled to @entity254 to meet with @entity256 's economy minister @entity255 ; her hair and clothes appear to blend in amongst the sea of suits , rather than sticking out @entity31 redux : in late september , @entity1 attended a dinner at the @entity263 , this time allowing her femininity to shine ‘ if one is seen as being too interested in fashion and appearance you are considered not as serious as one might be otherwise , ’ @entity192 says			1
@entity192 adds that her sharp attention to fashion could represent a ‘ pressure because she is representing the @entity10 nation and @entity10 women as a whole and is expected to demonstrate that stereotypical chicness			0
’ and at a time like this , it ’s not unlikely that @entity1 would attempt to adapt to her countrymen ’s pleasantly perceived archetype , rather than playing along with career social norms			2
but still , ‘ there is only a certain point she can go [ with fashion ] , ’ says @entity192			0
‘ it ’s something that will only change if there are more women in politics			0
i still think she has the pressure of conforming to a certain extent			0

@entity1 , who was acquitted of charges stemming from a *massive* fraud probe , has softened her look
she has reemerged from a lightened *summer* schedule with a new feminine wardrobe and hairstyle
the look subverts not only her industry 's standards , but those of her general age group as well
