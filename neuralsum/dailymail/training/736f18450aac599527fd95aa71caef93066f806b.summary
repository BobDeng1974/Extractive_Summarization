a plan for 200 solar panels on an island associated with crime writer @entity3 have been blasted as ' horrific ' by a former owner			1
@entity5 said the panels would ' spoil ' @entity7 off the south @entity9 coast			1
the current owners of the island and its hotel say the site , measuring 335 square metres , on a former tennis court , will be protected from view by hedges			1
the pretty @entity7 off the @entity17 could be set to go solar , which some say will ' spoil ' it literary inspiration : crime writer @entity3 wrote her novel @entity21 on @entity7 hotel owners : @entity23 and @entity24 , plan to install 200 solar panels on an old tennis court @entity24 and @entity23 , who own the @entity28 hotel where @entity3 stayed when she wrote , have applied to @entity29 in @entity9 for permission			1
but former owner @entity5 - who sold the island in 2001 - said : ' we are horrified that this application has been lodged			1
we spent 16 years doing everything we could to restore it to its former beauty			0
' now this green island sleeping in the sun is going to be scarred by this horrible shiny thing			1
it will be visible from miles away			0
it is going to glint in the sun and spoil the whole thing			2
' the island inspired the setting for @entity3 's @entity21 - one of her @entity48 mysteries			1
the plans for the implementation of the solar panels which can be viewed on the @entity29 website well hidden : the owners of the @entity28 hotel believe the solar panels would be concealed by hedges the @entity57 : its owners have applied for controversially permission to install solar panels nearby so far there have been four objections to the plan , including one from a neighbour who overlooks the island			2
@entity67 said : ' this would be a monstrous carbuncle on an old friend			0
it would be ruinous for the beauty of the island			2
' @entity74 , of @entity75 , said : ' as a feature the island is known around the world so this is bound to prove controversial and stir up a huge amount of interest			2
' a spokesman for @entity29 in @entity9 told @entity83 : ' i do n't think this type of planning application has been put forward for the island before , but every application is looked at individually on its merits			1
' the application will be looked at very carefully , it 's a unique situation in so far as @entity91 is a private island and yet planning is a public process			0
' all of the letters of objection , which can be viewed on @entity29 website along with the proposal , will be considered			0
mr @entity99 wrote : ' this can not be in the interests of protecting and maintaining an area of outstanding natural beauty which attracts people from far and wide			0
' putting solar panels where you suggest will be visible from all around on the mainland and clearly will ruin any walks that people might want to take on the island thus presumably having a negative impact on visitor numbers			0
' meanwhile mrs @entity111 added : ' i feel this will be a hideous eyesore and not in keeping with the surroundings at all			0

@entity3 wrote her novel @entity21 on the island in @entity9
the site , measuring 335 square metres , is planned for pretty @entity7
horrified former owner of island *describes* plans as a ' horrible shiny thing '
