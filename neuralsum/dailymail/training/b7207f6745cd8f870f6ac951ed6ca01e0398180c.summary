@entity1 artist @entity5 has been busy painting the faces of @entity8 's leaders for her new satirical exhibition @entity10 ' i 'm quite a sarcastic person and i thought the exhibition would be a good way to the information people are putting out there into imagery			1
' and no politician is safe from ms @entity5 's can of spray paint			2
among those who have made the satirical cut including prime minister @entity35 , @entity37 @entity36 , @entity38 , education minister @entity39 , immigration minister @entity40 and foreign minister @entity41			1
this cardboard painting of prime minister @entity35 as a homeless man is one of ms @entity5 's favourites due to its social context former @entity47 is painted on a goon bag after he publicly resigned after lying about a $ 3,000 bottle of wine he received ' i mainly focused on them because they 're the ones in the media spotlight at the moment			1
some of their statements , for whatever reason , have been quite controversial , ' ms @entity5 said			2
@entity40 's face has been painted onto a welcome mat because of his role as the immigration minister in stopping asylum seekers from coming to @entity8 via boat			0
education minister @entity39 is featured sitting on a chair in the ' naughty corner ' and foreign minister @entity41 was painted with her head in the sand due to her stance on climate change			0
ms @entity5 drew inspiration from comments by politicians that have made waves on social media for being controversial , like billionaire @entity38 pictured here as a walrus @entity40 's face has been painted onto a welcome mat because of his role as the immigration minister in stopping asylum seekers from coming to @entity8 via boat former prime ministers @entity82 and @entity83 , who infamously toppled each other from @entity86 's leadership have been painted on tombstones ' but the @entity35 piece with him as a homeless person is my favourite			1
i live in @entity92 and regularly see people begging for money to survive			0
i always feel an immense amount of empathy for them and i was trying to depict if there was any empathy in politics ? ' ms @entity5 said she was n't trying to push an agenda with her artwork , just prompt discussion			0
' i just want people to get a laugh out of it and then make up their own minds , ' she said			0
ms @entity5 painted @entity39 sitting on a chair in the ' naughty corner ' for his role as the federal education minister foreign minister @entity41 has been painted with ' her head in the sand ' for her position on climate change this artwork by ms @entity5 earned her a finalist spot in the @entity118 2014 @entity120 president @entity119 will make a brief appearance in ms @entity5 's exhibition as the only international politician			2
mr @entity35 reportedly gifted him a surfboard ' i really do think people will see the humorous side			0
