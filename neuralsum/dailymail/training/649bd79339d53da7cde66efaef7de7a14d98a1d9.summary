by @entity0 in a letter sent to her mother in june 1931 , 23 - year - old @entity2 school - teacher @entity1 apologizes for not writing sooner			1
the irony is , her mother would never receive the note			0
eighty - three years later , both women are dead but the nine - page letter did find its way back to their family after being discovered in a @entity11 , @entity13 post office			1
the letter was finally delivered last month to @entity1 's niece and recipient @entity17 's granddaughter , 69 - year - old @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity2			1
snail mail : @entity21 , @entity2 school teacher @entity1 sent this letter home to her mother , @entity17 , in 1931			1
it was finally delivered last month , though both women have since died piece of history : in the letter , @entity1 ( left ) apologized for not writing to her mother ( right ) sooner the test of time : the nine - page letter was in remarkably good condition when post officials found it last month ' one of the best parts for me of what she wrote was that she apologized for not writing sooner , as she knew her mother had been anxiously waiting all week for a letter — which , as we know , was never received , ' @entity17 told the @entity41			1
' she said " i ’m just getting around to write			0
i imagine you have been anxiously waiting for a letter all week			0
i have no excuses , but that i just did n’t get to it and there are lots of things to tell you , too			0
" ' @entity50 was the @entity11 post office clerk who discovered the letter , and said one detail made it really stick out			1
' as i was sorting i came across it — it appeared to be old , but it was in really good condition , ' @entity50 said			0
' it had a two - cent stamp on it			0
i knew it was old and the handwriting was old			0
' what happened ? the letter was discovered by a post office clerk in @entity11 , @entity13 while sorting the morning mail			1
she reckons the letter slipped into sorting equipment where it lay hidden for decades lucky : it was a bit of a miracle that the letter was delivered since the family changed their last name from @entity17 to @entity17 and moved to @entity76 , @entity2 40 years ago she reckons the letter slipped ' neatly ' into some old sorting equipment where it lay hidden over the decades			1
knowing that the address would not be correct with modern practices , @entity50 gave the letter to her postmaster			2
the postmaster then contacted the @entity11 fire chief who knew the @entity86 moved to @entity87 40 years ago , and changed their last name to @entity17			2
@entity76 postmaster @entity89 hand delivered the letter to @entity91 , a retired lawyer and @entity94 judge , who then gave it to his sister @entity97 now ms @entity17 is trying to solve the mystery of why the letter never got delivered			2
she hopes someone will read the news about the letter 's resurfacing come forward to say ' i found it ' and how			0
in the family : @entity1 's niece and recipient @entity17 's granddaughter @entity17 , 69 ( left ) , is now the proud owner of the letter			2

teacher @entity1 was 23 - years - old when she wrote a letter home to her mother @entity17 in june 1931
the letter was never delivered , but resurfaced last month at a post office in @entity11 , @entity13
both women have since died , so the local postmaster tracked down *relatives* now living in @entity76 , @entity2
