by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 11:45 est , 29 january 2014 a tattered scrap of papyrus has been found to feature original @entity5 poetry dating back to the 7th century @entity6 @entity8 papyrologist dr. @entity7 was asked to translate the ancient text by the unidentified owner and was shocked to discover it featured not one , but two of the @entity16 poet 's original verses			1
only a handful of original @entity5 poetry has survived , printed on various fragments of papyrus , and only one of these poems is written in full			1
the papyrus , pictured , was translated by @entity8 papyrologist dr. @entity7 who confirmed it features two poems written by 7th century @entity16 poet @entity5			1
the first contains reference to @entity5 's family , while the other is a poem addressed to the @entity16 goddess of love @entity30 @entity5 was a @entity16 lyrist renowned for her verses about love and loss			1
in particular , many of her poems described a love of women and female homosexuality			0
in fact , modern - day words including ' lesbian ' and ' sapphic ' , are said to have derived from @entity5 , her poems and her time on the isle of @entity47			2
in total , @entity5 wrote nine volumes of poems and while these latest findings do not feature complete poems , due to the tattered edges of the papyrus , there is a substantial amount of text to confirm they are @entity59 in style			1
the first poem contains reference to two men called @entity64 and @entity65			0
@entity5 ( @entity68 bust pictured right ) was a @entity16 poet believed to have been born between 630 and 612 bc. she was an aristocrat who married a merchant , and had a daughter called @entity71			2
during the 7th century @entity6 , @entity5 spent time studying the arts on the isle of @entity47 writing poetry and composing music			1
she wrote her poems in what ’s now become known as the ‘ sapphic meter ’ and was part of a new wave of @entity16 lyrists who wrote poetry from their own viewpoint , rather than the viewpoint of the gods , which was traditional during that time			2
in particular , @entity5 was one of the first poets to describe love , and loss , as it affected her personally			2
many of her poems expressed love and affection for women and modern - day words used to describe female homosexuality , namely ' lesbian ' and ' sapphic ' , derived from @entity5 , her poems and her time on the isle of @entity47			2
many modern poets have been inspired by @entity5 , including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , who have all cited @entity5 as a strong influence on their work			0
these are the names the @entity106 gave to @entity5 ’s brothers , yet the poem is the first evidence of them found in @entity5 ’s poetry			2
it describes a conversation between two people about the success of @entity64 ’ latest sea voyage and appears to be written in the first person			0
the other is a poem addressed to the @entity16 goddess of love @entity30			0

@entity5 was a 7th century @entity16 lyrist renowned for her verses about love and loss			1
in particular , many of her poems described love of women and female homosexuality and modern - day words including lesbian and sapphic derive from @entity5 only a handful of original poems and poem fragments have survived , including this papyrus found in 1922 as dr. @entity7 explained : ‘ all the poems of @entity5 ’s first book seem to have been about family , biography , and cult , together with poems about love [ and ] @entity30			1
' the poems were also written in a @entity16 dialect called @entity153 , a language @entity5 often used to write her poems in , and which was different from @entity16			1
additionally , both were written in the so - called sapphic stanza - a poetic meter created by @entity5 - and dr @entity7 claims this leaves him in no doubt the poems are from @entity5 ’s original poetry collection			1
' the new @entity5 is the best preserved @entity5 papyrus in existence , with just a few letters that had to be restored in the first poem , and not a single word that is in doubt			1
its content is equally exciting			0
' according to dr @entity7 , the style of handwriting suggests the poem was transcribed onto the papyrus in around the 3rd century @entity172			1
