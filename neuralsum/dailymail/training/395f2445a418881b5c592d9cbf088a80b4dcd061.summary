but this polar bear showed she was actually a barrel of laughs when she grabbed hold of this plastic container and started performing tricks in front of astonished spectators			0
@entity15 , a six - year - old resident of @entity17 in @entity18 , spotted the blue barrel floating in the water			1
she then gently rolled the barrel to a safe spot on the ice , and gave her watching public a 10 - minute demonstration of her agility when she carefully climbed on top and performed a balancing act one might normally associate with a circus elephant			1
@entity48 , a camera operator for @entity50 from @entity51 , @entity52 , was delighted to capture the moment			0
the 55 - year - old said : ' she was swimming in her exhibit and then decided to drag the barrel out , then she started to attempt the balancing act			1
mount : the six - year - old steadies herself in preparation for her astonishing trick ' she balanced on the barrel for around ten seconds and i was delighted to see her do this			1
' polar bears , like all bears , have a very strong ability to balance			0
' she played with the barrel for a good ten minutes and afterwards she dragged it back into the water and started pouncing on it			2
' entertaining : showing unusual dexterity for a mammal of her size , @entity15 lefts her last supporting foot ms @entity48 has been watching polar bears closely for almost 20 years and has been a volunteer at her her local zoo in @entity52 since 1996			2
she added : ' it 's always a joy to see animals playing			0
