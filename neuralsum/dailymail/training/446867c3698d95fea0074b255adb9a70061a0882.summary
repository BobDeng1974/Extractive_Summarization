the @entity1 parliament has renounced @entity1 's ' non-aligned ' status with the aim of eventually joining @entity5 - a move angering @entity7 which views the @entity5 's eastward expansion as a threat to its own security			1
@entity11 first announced its intention of seeking the protection of @entity5 membership in august following what it deemed the open participation of @entity18 's military during the separatist war in its eastern provinces			1
@entity18 foreign minister @entity21 called @entity1 's renunciation of its neutral military and political status a ' counterproductive ' step that would only boost tensions around the crisis in the east			1
addressing deputies in @entity11 before the vote , @entity1 foreign minister @entity31 said the move underscored the country 's determination to pivot towards @entity36 and the @entity37			2
' this will lead to integration in the @entity36 and the @entity64 - @entity63 space , ' he said			0
the amendment passed easily , receiving 303 votes , 77 more than the minimum required to pass into law			0
any accession to the @entity71 military alliance is likely to take years , but a @entity5 spokesman in @entity73 said : ' our door is open and @entity1 will become a member of @entity5 if it so requests and fulfils the standards and adheres to the necessary principles			2
' ties between @entity7 and @entity11 are at an all - time low since @entity18 's annexation of the @entity83 peninsula from @entity1 in march and the subsequent outbreak of the @entity86 rebellion in the east			1
the @entity71 authorities in @entity11 accuse @entity18 of orchestrating and arming the uprising after the overthrow of a @entity1 president sympathetic to @entity7			0
the @entity92 denies that it is behind the revolt .			0

@entity1 parliament has taken steps towards *closer* ties with the @entity37
the decision to begin seeking @entity5 membership is likely to anger @entity18
@entity18 said it was ' counterproductive ' for *stability* in @entity1 's east
