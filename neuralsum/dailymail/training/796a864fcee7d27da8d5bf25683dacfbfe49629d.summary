the driver who was at the controls of a speeding commuter train which derailed killing four people has been suspended without pay			1
engineer @entity5 claims he fell into ' a hypnosis - like daze ' when his @entity9 train ran off the rails along a curve on the outskirts of @entity13 while travelling at 82 mph			1
today rail bosses confirmed the 46 - year - old had been suspended immediately after the derailment and following a drug test , in line with railroad policy , according to @entity16			1
under scrutiny : @entity5 initially told investigators that the brakes did n't work but then he later said that he may have ' dozed off ' behind the wheel on the sunday morning shift earlier his lawer @entity27 accompanied mr @entity5 to his interview with @entity30 investigators and described the account his client had given			1
@entity27 said the engineer experienced a nod or ‘ a daze , ’ almost like road fatigue or the phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis			0
he could n't say how long it lasted			0
what @entity5 remembers is ‘ operating the train , coming to a section where the track was still clear - then , all of a sudden , feeling something was wrong and hitting the brakes , ’ @entity27 said			1
‘ ... he felt something was not right , and he hit the brakes			0
’ suspended : train driver @entity5 is wheeled on a stretcher away from the area where the commuter train he was operating derailed in the @entity52 borough of @entity13 nodded : an attorney who accompanied @entity5 to his meeting with the @entity30 said the engineer has now revealed he nodded off just prior to the crash and awoke when it was too late to brake he called @entity59 ‘ a guy with a stellar record who , i believe , did nothing wrong			1
’ ‘ you 've got a good guy and an accident , ’ he said			0
‘ ... a terrible accident is what it is			0
’ @entity5 ‘ basically nodded , ’ said @entity69 , leader of the rail employees union , relating what he said the engineer told him			2
‘ he had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car , ’ @entity69 said			0
‘ that is , you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that might be			0
’ @entity80 : the @entity9 train entered a 30mph curve at 82mph in @entity13 , derailing and coming to a halt feet from the @entity84 getting answers : federal investigators have determined that there was nothing technically wrong with the train 's brakes before the sunday morning crash but came short of fully blaming the conductor investigators have determined earlier that the deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with the train itself as the driver had originally claimed			1
the @entity30 said in a tuesday press conference that it had n't found any evidence of brake or signal trouble during the train 's nine previous stops along @entity13 's @entity84 on sunday morning			1
@entity30 member @entity105 said tuesday there were ' no anomalies ' with the train but it was too soon to formally say whether the excessive speed was the result of human error - say , a sleepy or distracted operator - or a mechanical problem			2
clean up : engineers begin the task of recovering the derailed carriages from the banks of the @entity84 while investigators had yet to finish talking with engineer @entity5 , questions swirled around him because the train went into the curve at nearly three times the speed limit			1
dozens of people were injured and four people were killed			1
as @entity30 worked to determine what caused the sunday morning wreck in the @entity52 , governor @entity128 said @entity5 should be disciplined for ' unjustifiable ' speed			1
investigators began talking to the engineer monday but did n't complete the interview			2
the @entity135 is conducting its own investigation , with help from the @entity52 district attorney 's office , in the event the derailment becomes a criminal case			2
whatever the findings on the cause of the crash , @entity128 said tuesday the engineer could be faulted for the train 's speed alone			2
recovery : federal investigators would n't comment on @entity5 's level of alertness around the time of the sunday morning wreck , which killed 4			1
shown are recovery operations in the @entity52 on monday ' certainly , we want to make sure that that operator is disciplined in an appropriate way			0
there 's such a gross deviation from the norm , ' the governor said			0
an attorney for @entity5 did n't immediately return calls tuesday , but his union spoke up in his defense			2
' this is a man who is totally distraught by the loss of life , and he 's having a tough time dealing with that , ' said @entity69 , his union leader			0
' once the @entity30 is done with their investigation and @entity176 is finished with his interview , it will be quite evident that there was no criminal intent with the operation of his train , ' @entity69 said			2
@entity5 had an unblemished record prior to the accident but told investigators after the crash that he had ' zoned out '			1
the engineer , who is married with no children , has worked for the railroad for about 20 years and has been an engineer for 11 , @entity69 said			0
critical : governor @entity128 , seen at the crash site on sunday alongside @entity30 's @entity105 , has now said that the engineer will undoubtedly be punished for the ' unjustifiable ' speed as he was going 82mph in a 30mph zone @entity5 lives in a well - kept house on a modest rural road in @entity199 , @entity200 , about 40 miles south of @entity201			1
he started as a custodian at @entity203 , then monitored the building 's fire alarms and other systems , and ultimately became an engineer			0
@entity5 's work routine had recently changed : he had begun running that route on november 17 , two weeks before the wreck , said @entity211 , a spokeswoman for @entity9 's parent , the @entity213			1
a @entity9 passenger train lays on its side after derailing on sunday in the @entity52 borough of @entity13 leaving four people dead @entity69 said @entity5 had changed work schedules - switching from afternoons to the day shift , which typically begins at 5am - but was familiar with the route and qualified to run it			1
' he was a stellar employee			0
unbelievable , ' said his former supervisor , @entity224 , who retired from the railroad about a year ago			0
@entity226 said he was stunned when he heard about the crash , shortly after opening his mail to find a @entity230 card from @entity5 and his wife			2
' i said , " well , i ca n't imagine @entity176 making a mistake , " ' @entity226 said			0
' not intentionally , by any stretch of the imagination			0
