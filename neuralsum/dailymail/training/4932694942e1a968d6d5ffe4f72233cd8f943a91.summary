@entity0 has confirmed @entity3 youngsters @entity1 and @entity4 will be in the squad for saturday 's match against @entity7 at @entity8			1
the two under 21 defenders have been drafted in to deal with a lengthy injury list which includes centre backs @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity15 , who has been deputising in that position , is suspended after being sent off against @entity17 last week			1
' they [ @entity1 and @entity4 ] are in the squad , ' @entity18 told @entity21 on friday			1
' that is why we have a youth education			2
it was also our policy [ to use the youth teams ] and always the policy of the club too			2
' @entity4 , left , and @entity1 , right , have been promoted from the reserves to the @entity3 senior squad for saturday 's match against @entity7 @entity1 , a 19 - year - old defender , is pcitured shielding the ball from @entity33 in training			1
he could partner @entity35 , right , at centre back at @entity8 @entity4 , centre , jostles with @entity3 's summer signing @entity38 as the @entity39 prepare to face @entity41 's @entity7 side on saturday afternoon with @entity3 's three first - choice centre backs out , the @entity42 is expected to drop @entity44 international @entity35 into the centre , with either @entity4 , the club 's reserve team captain , or 19 - year - old @entity1 , partnering him in the heart of @entity3 's backline			1
when asked if @entity49 and @entity35 were an option as a centre - back pairing , he said : ' no , i do n't like having too many left - sided defenders or left - footed players in defence			1
' i think always of balance so [ instead ] i have to pick up a right - sided central defender from the youth education			1
normally , i am always doing things like that			2
i have already said that we have a lot of vacancies when you buy only six players and let 14 players go			2
' @entity4 , second from left , follows in his captain @entity33 's footsteps as @entity3 's first - team squad is put through its paces at @entity70 @entity0 chats to @entity71 at @entity70 ahead of @entity3 's game against @entity7 , while @entity74 pair @entity73 and @entity75 are all smiles @entity3 captain @entity33 looks in high spirits at the club 's training ground , despite their poor start to the @entity83 campaign the @entity85 pair of @entity86 and @entity35 smile with one another in training despite the @entity89 forward having heavy strapping on his right knee ' the amount of injuries is worrying me and they are not coming back , ' the former @entity93 boss continued			1
' @entity14 is already , for the third time , injured			1
@entity13 had one injury in the national team , which was unfortunate			1
' i am a coach with a lot of experience and i believe i have never been in this situation			0
it is surprising me and i am evaluating myself and my staff and also the players to see what is wrong but i can not imagine what we are doing at another level than in my former clubs			0
' @entity18 said saturday 's game against @entity7 could also see a league debut for @entity114 , who joined the club from @entity116 in the summer but has been kept out by injury			1
' maybe last week he could have played but it is better to give an injured player more time to recover and that 's why he did n't play last week			1
he is now ready to play and i am anxious to see him			0
' @entity114 , pictured in training with @entity86 on friday , could make his league debut for the @entity39 after recovering from injury @entity3 vice-captain @entity124 jogs ahead of @entity4 , who looked to be enjoying himself after being promoted from the reserves to @entity18 's senior squad when asked if the 5 - 3 defeat to @entity17 was a one - off , @entity18 said : ' yes , of course			1
i 've spoken with the media and they are thinking it is a record occurrence			0
' for a player i hope it is a once in a lifetime incident			0
me , as a coach , i have experienced such a result in @entity138			0
we have to learn from it and improve			0
' the @entity42 said he has been impressed by @entity71 's versatility since his summer move from @entity74 giants @entity143			1
' in both positions he is playing fantastic , ' said @entity18			0
' he is creating a lot , he is scoring goals and he gives assists			0
so , as a coach , you can not want more			0
but we have also the main moment in football when we lose the ball and then he can improve			0
' on @entity86 's fitness as he recovers from a serious knee injury , he said : ' we are building up @entity86 in the same way we are building up the other players			2
you will notice i left @entity159 to train for the first three weeks before he came in for 60 minutes			0
i did the same with @entity86			0
he has impressed me and played very well			0
i hope he can continue			0
' the devilish duo of @entity86 and @entity161 chat in training a week after combining to great effect for @entity3 's opening goal against @entity17 @entity33 beams while putting his arm round first - team coach @entity165 during a training session in the sunshine at @entity3 's @entity70 training complex the 63 - year - old said he believes @entity7 are the toughest opponents @entity3 will have faced this season			1
' i think maybe this is the best team we have to beat until now , ' he said			2
' i was very impressed [ with their win over @entity176 ]			2
they play the same system we do			0
it is more or less one system against the same system			0
they play like a team			2
we have to learn and improve on the game against @entity17			1
i hope we will give our best and the defence can enjoy a victory again			0
' i hope that we play better as a team , especially when we lose the ball			2
we have to do better than against @entity17			1
