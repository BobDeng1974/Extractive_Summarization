his best - known characters characters are famous for their clothes			2
but the @entity3 and the @entity4 have previous little in common with the stars another dr @entity6 tale			1
indeed , the gang of naked sisters who star in @entity10 : the @entity12 â€™s @entity11 , are famous for wearing no clothes at all			1
not the usual : dr @entity6 penned this saucy book in 1939 - but it never gained much popularity despite featuring pages of cartoon nudity the famed author , whose birthday yesterday is now celebrated as a national reading festival , wrote and illustrated the failed exhibitionist tome in 1939			1
but despite his efforts to ' draw the sexiest babes i could ' , it only sold 2,500 copies , and went out of print			1
as a recent feature in @entity31 details , the book retells the @entity33 legend of @entity34 - who rode naked through the streets of @entity36 to protest her husband 's unfair tax hikes			1
however , @entity6 altered the story by multiplying the number of nudes by seven - and making sure they stayed that way at all times , rather than just to prove a point			1
in a foreword to the out - of - print tale , he wrote that he was correcting an inaccuracy in inserting six more naked women into the story - and that their nudity was a source of ' pride '			1
not quite : dr @entity6 is much better - known for other creations , such as the cat in the hat @entity57 : @entity6 , also known as @entity6 , decided to stick to children 's books after @entity10 @entity6 , real name @entity6 , wrote that he was in fact telling ' a beautiful story of love , honor and scientific achievement '			1
publishing the book was allegedly a condition for @entity68 , @entity6 's new publisher , when he jumped ship to them			2
however , it seems few agreed with his own high opinion of the bawdy tale			2
while 10,000 copies were printed , only 2,500 were ever bought			0
he later accepted that the book was no good			2
according to the @entity78 , he said : ' i attempted to draw the sexiest babes i could , but they came out looking absurd			1
after the experience he turned his back on the adult audience			0
his @entity86 obituary records him once saying : ' i 'd rather write for kids			0
they 're more appreciative ; adults are obsolete children , and the hell with them			0
' before dr @entity6 decided that she should have six naked cartoon sisters , @entity34 was a well - known figure in @entity33 legend , whose story introduced @entity34 into the world			1
@entity34 was a real historical figure who lived in the 11th - century city of @entity36 , and was married to @entity99 of @entity100			0
according to folklore , she rode naked through the streets to free her people from her husband 's oppressive tax regime			0
original : @entity34 was the legendary wife of an @entity33 earl , who rode naked through the streets of @entity36 as a protest against an unfair tax on his people			2
she is pictured above in an 1898 oil painting by @entity115 @entity34 had begged her husband to lift the onerous taxes time and again - but failed to persuade him			0
eventually , he said he would only relent if she completed the implausible task of riding naked through the streets - which she agreed to			2
to preserve her modesty , she asked all the citizens of the town to clear the streets , shutter their windows and look away			0
according to the story , everybody complied except a tailor called @entity34			0
but after stealing a glance , he was struck instantly blind			0
he , and people like him , were known forever afterwards as a @entity34 .			0
