this poor sea lion pup got more than it bargained for when it came ashore on @entity2 beach			1
the young animal had clearly run into trouble at the popular @entity6 beach spot , getting stuck between two boulders			1
one passer - by was obviously enchanted with the animal and stopped to film as the determined pup worked to free itself			2
the pup finds itself in a bit of a tight squeeze as it is trapped between two boulders the young animal was seen trying to tug itself free on @entity2 beach in @entity6 footage shows the sea lion trying to pull itself up and out of the gap between the two rocks			1
the poor animal tires every now and again and stops to rest its head on the rock			0
at one point it even lies back , breathes a huge sigh and closes its eyes			0
but slowly it manages to wriggle itself free			0
the young pup 's battle is not over yet though			0
the next hurdle is to pull itself up from water level and onto a rock for a rest			0
the patient cameraman captures the animal heaving itself up onto the rock , clearly exhausted from all the effort			0
desperately trying to manoevre itself and wriggle free , the seal pup does n't give up however , at one moment it all seems too much and the sea lion lies back and closes its eyes finally the sea lion and makes it and looks around as if pretending it was never in trouble at all			1
after a short rest and even a moment to close its eyes , the sea lion decides it is probably safer back in the water and can be seen gliding straight back into the sea			1
but with renewed vigour the sea lion manages to strain its way out of the gap and clamber to safety the poor sea lion still does n't look too pleased , but at least it is safe on the rock			2

sea lion ran into trouble on @entity2 beach , @entity6
it 's weary work trying to free itself , and pup rests its head many times
after the *personal* workout , the sea lion then glides off into the sea
