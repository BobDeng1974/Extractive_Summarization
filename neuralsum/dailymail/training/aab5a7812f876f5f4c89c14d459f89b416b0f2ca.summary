genetic clues : the @entity2 caveman had black hair , dark skin and blue eyes contrary to given understanding of racial transformation his piercing blue eyes are in striking contrast to his dark complexion and hair			1
it means this 7,000 - year - old caveman holds the clue to man ’s genetic evolution			2
his remains were discovered 5,000ft up in the mountains of north - west @entity19 in 2006			1
experts were astonished to find the ancient hunter - gatherer , given the name @entity23 1 , had a combination of @entity25 and @entity27 genes			1
results from an analysis of dna taken from a tooth show he had dark – possibly black – hair and skin with deep blue eyes , the online edition of the journal @entity30 reports			2
the mixture of @entity25 and @entity27 traits implies that the racial transformation of modern humans was still in progress long after they left @entity25 , with changes in eye colour coming before alterations in skin tone			1
study leader professor @entity48 , of the @entity49 in @entity50 , said : ‘ the biggest surprise was to discover that this individual possessed @entity25 versions in the genes that determine the light pigmentation of the current @entity56			0
' even more surprising was to find that he possessed the genetic variations that produce blue eyes			0
’ @entity59 shows genetic similarities to @entity61 and also shared a common ancestor with people who lived in @entity64 more than 20,000 years ago			1
his was one of two unusually well preserved male skeletons unearthed from the @entity68 cave system near @entity69			0
the scientists focused first on @entity23 1 's dna because it was in better condition			1
they hope in due course to piece together the genome of the other man , @entity23 2			2
both individuals have been dated to around 7,000 years old			0
they lived in the @entity78 period , which ended 5,000 years ago with the development of agriculture and livestock farming in the @entity82			0
discovery : the remains of the 7,000 - year - old man were found 5,000ft up a mountain in north - west @entity19 despite @entity23 1 's dark colour , the research revealed genetic similarities with @entity61 from @entity90 and @entity91			1
he also shared a common ancestor with people who inhabited the @entity96 site of @entity97 , near @entity98 , @entity64 , more than 20,000 years ago			0
dna from one of the @entity100 , a boy , last year revealed links with native americans			2
' these data indicate that there is genetic continuity in the populations of central and western @entity107 , ' said @entity108			0
@entity23 1 's genome hints at some of the changes that occurred in humans as a result of switching from a hunter - gatherer existence to farming			1
he would have been unable to digest lactose in milk or to cope with the starchy food that became the mainstay of later @entity122 farmers			0
transformation : this is an artists impression of the man 's face based on @entity33 from his tooth tests : so - called @entity23 1 was found alongside another - @entity23 2 - which scientists hope to examine shortly farming is thought to have driven changes in the human immune system as a result of exposure to bacteria and viruses from animals			1
but a number of dna variants conferring resistance to infection in modern @entity56 were already present in the hunter - gatherer			2
this suggests they did not arise as an adaptation to farming , but had a more ancient origin			0
the mixture of @entity25 and @entity27 traits implies that long after modern humans left @entity25 their racial transformation was still in progress , with changes in eye colour coming before alterations in skin tone			1
writing in @entity30 , the scientists concluded : ' our results indicate that the adaptive spread of light skin pigmentation alleles ( genetic variants ) was not complete in some @entity27 populations by the @entity78 , and that the spread of alleles associated with light / blue eye colour may have preceded changes in skin pigmentation			0

remains discovered *5000ft* up mountains of north - west @entity19
findings suggest racial transformation happened later than thought
man , *dubbed* @entity23 1 , also shows similarity to @entity61 dna
