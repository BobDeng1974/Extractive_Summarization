anxiously waiting for a phone call home is a scenario that any parent will understand			0
this evening that call was coming from 500 million miles , after a decade away and two and half years without contact			0
the @entity9 spacecraft was due to send in a signal to the @entity11 at 5.30pm this evening			1
it is due to arrive at the comet in august this year @entity9 , named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient @entity27 hieroglyphs , will seek to help scientists unlock the composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar system			1
the probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity16 and @entity17 to line it up with its final destination : @entity39 – @entity40			1
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity9 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity43 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1
later this year , @entity9 will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting with it in august , before putting its @entity50 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			1
‘ it could come any moment now , ’ said operations manager @entity53			0
‘ we could get the signal at any time			0
’ eventually , at 6.18pm , a tiny beep came through , a spike on a graph that showed the £ 1billion spacecraft was still intact			0
a few seconds later the all - clear message ‘ @entity62 ! ’ was sent out on social networking sites			0
the @entity9 craft is hurtling through space in a ten - year long pursuit of an icy comet			1
for the last 31 months it has been in hibernation , too far away from the sun for its solar panels to generate enough power to keep it going			1
but today , as it closed in on its target , it was woken up to prepare for several months of delicate manoeuvres			0
at 10am an alarm triggered a process by which its systems were slowly warmed up and turned on			2
the process was due to have taken just over seven hours before a signal was sent to @entity16 , a process that took 45 minutes			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) received the all - clear message ' @entity62 ! ' from its @entity9 spacecraft , 500 million miles away , shortly after 6pm the signal was received by @entity85 's @entity84 ground station in @entity86 at 18:18 gmt , during the first window of opportunity the spacecraft had to communicate with @entity16			1
it was immediately confirmed in @entity11 's space operations centre in @entity92 ( pictured ) a screenshot of the moment the signal was received from @entity9			2
the spacecraft 's orbit has brought it back to within 673 million km from the sun the @entity9 mission will perform several historical firsts , including the first time a spacecraft orbits a comet rather than just whizzing by it to snap some fly - by pictures , and the first time a probe has landed on a comet 's nucleus			1
@entity9 is also the first mission to venture beyond the main asteroid belt relying solely on solar cells for power generation , which is also why it had to be put into a deep sleep for 957 days			1
' it has been so far away from the sun that the solar rays were not able to generate enough energy to safely operate the spacecraft , said @entity9 spacecraft operations manager @entity53 , who has been working on the @entity9 mission since 1997			1
but either @entity9 ’s four clocks had fallen out of sync way out in space , or the warm - up took a little longer than anticipated			2
eventually , 48 minutes behind schedule , the message came through to the operations centre in @entity92 , @entity123 , to huge cheers			0
‘ it has been a fantastic few moments of pure terror , ’ said one exhausted organiser			0
@entity9 is now around 5.6 million miles from its destination , the comet @entity129 , and closing on the object at half a mile a second			2
the spacecraft , which was launched by in @entity133 in 2004 , will now spend several months approaching and orbiting the comet			1
once it has found for a suitable landing site for the box - like @entity50 lander it will attempt a landing in november			0
@entity50 will also capture panoramic images of the view from the comet ’s surface with an on - board camera			0
scientists hope @entity9 will answer important questions about the origins of the solar system and the way comets evolve and develop			1
@entity9 was put to sleep to conserve power as it headed to regions as distant as the planet @entity43 , where the sun ’s weak rays provide only limited amounts of energy			1
unlike other long - distance space probes the craft has no nuclear batteries and instead relies on electricity generated by ultra-sensitive 15 - metre long solar panels			0
scientists planned to hibernate @entity9 for 957 days before bringing its main systems back on line			2
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity9 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity43 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation later this year , @entity9 will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting with it in august , before putting its @entity50 lander onto the comet 's surface in november @entity9 is now around 5.6 million miles from its destination , the comet @entity129 , and closing on the object at half a mile a second			1
the spacecraft , which was launched by in @entity133 in 2004 , will now spend several months approaching and orbiting the comet			1
once it has found for a suitable site , it will attempt a landing in november			0
scientists are particularly keen to conduct organic chemistry experiments on samples from the comet 's body			2
one of @entity9 's first tasks will be to scout for a suitable landing location for its piggyback - riding @entity50 probe			2
scientists are particularly keen to conduct organic chemistry experiments on samples drilled out from inside the comet 's body			2
‘ it would be really interesting to find out whether the organic chemistry that is relevant for life is there on comets , ’ professor @entity192 said			0
engineers who designed the lander did not know what type of terrain they would find on the comet 's surface			0
it is outfitted with twin harpoons laced with tethers that will be fired into the comet 's surface to anchor @entity50 and keep it from bouncing back into space after touchdown			0
the spacecraft will be involved a high - speed chase later this year followed by a delicate dance around comet @entity129			0

@entity9 spacecraft aims to better understand the composition of comets
it launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times
@entity226 has been hibernating for most of the past three years to save power
its alarm sounded at 10am but its signal to @entity16 did *n't* arrive until 6pm
the probe will land on comet @entity39 – @entity40 in november
scientists hope the mission will provide more clues about how the solar system came into *existence*
