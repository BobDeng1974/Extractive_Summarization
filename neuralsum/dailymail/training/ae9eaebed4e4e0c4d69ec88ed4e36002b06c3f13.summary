pictured is professor @entity1 , the academic at the centre of the ‘ @entity7 ’ affair , whose raw data is crucial to the theory of climate change high - profile rows over climate science have had no lasting impact on people ’s views on global warming			1
this is according to an analysis of search terms on @entity17 from 2004 to 2013 around two events : ' @entity7 ' and the discovery of an error about the melting of @entity23 glaciers in a major @entity25 climate report			2
in both these incidents , media coverage highlighted apparent issues with the science			0
during ' climategate ' emails were hacked from the @entity32 ’s @entity31 in november 2009 ( @entity31 ) and used to accuse scientists of misconduct			1
sceptics seized on phrases from the emails such as ' trick ... to hide the decline ' in data on temperatures to claim scientists manipulated or deleted data to support the evidence of global warming , though they were cleared of doing so following several independent inquiries			1
shortly afterwards , in january 2010 , news broke of an error about the rate of ice melt in the @entity51 in the @entity53 ’s fourth assessment report , a major review of climate science			1
although there were spikes in the search term ' global warming hoax ' , indicating scepticism , as news of the incidents emerged , levels of the search quickly fell back to previous lows , the study published in the journal @entity56 found			1
the search term ' climategate ' halved six days after a peak in public interest , the research found			1
the study ’s co-author dr @entity73 , from the @entity75 , said : ' the study uses the search term ‘ global warming hoax ’ as an indicator of global warming scepticism amongst the public			1
in january 2010 , news broke of an error about the rate of ice melt in the @entity51 in the @entity53 ’s fourth assessment report			1
pictured is @entity85 , the head of @entity25 's @entity53 , who admitted that the figure needs reviewing ' although we found an increase in the volume of searches for the term immediately after the news of the hacking of the emails from the @entity31 at the @entity32 , the search volume quickly returns to the same level as before the incident			1
' this suggests no long - term change in the level of climate change scepticism			2
' the research also found that ' global warming ' was more commonly searched for than ' climate change ' , although the gap between the two had narrowed			2
but the analysis suggested an overall fall in interest in the subject since a peak in 2007 after @entity113 ’s climate documentary ' @entity114 ' was released and the @entity53 ’s fourth assessment report was published			0
the analysis suggested an overall fall in interest in the subject since a peak in 2007 after @entity113 ’s climate documentary ' an @entity114 ' was released and the @entity53 ’s fourth assessment report was published dr @entity119 , from @entity120 , said : ' our results showed that the volume of these search terms peaked in 2007 around a unique sequence of major events - the releases of @entity113 ’s @entity114 in august 2006 and the @entity53 fourth assessment report in april 2007 - and the level of interest has declined since then			2
' there is no single reason why the public have become less interested in climate change			0
however research certainly suggests that economic issues , such as the recent recession , tend to take precedence over environmental issues like climate change			0
' although there were spikes in the search term ' global warming hoax ' after both events , indicating scepticism , levels of the search quickly fell back to previous lows a scientific study which suggests global warming has been exaggerated was rejected by a respected journal because it might fuel climate scepticism , it was claimed last week			1
the alarming intervention , which raises fears of ‘ @entity158 ’ pressure for environmental scientists to conform , came after a reviewer said the research was ‘ less than helpful ’ to the climate cause			2
professor @entity162 , a research fellow at the @entity163 and one of five authors of the study , said he suspected that intolerance of dissenting views on climate science was preventing his paper from being published			0
‘ the problem we now have in the climate community is that some scientists are mixing up their scientific role with that of a climate activist , ’ he told the @entity171			0
prof @entity162 ’s paper suggests that the @entity181 ’s environment might be much less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought			0
if he and his four co-authors are correct , it would mean that carbon dioxide and other pollutants are having a far less severe impact on climate than green activists would have us believe			0
the research , if made public , would be a huge challenge to the finding of the @entity25 ’s @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , that the global average temperature would rise by up to 4.5c if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were allowed to double			0
the paper suggested that the climate might be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than had been claimed by the @entity53 in its report last september , and recommended that more work be carried out ‘ to reduce the underlying uncertainty ’ .			0

during ' climategate ' , emails were hacked from the @entity32
the *revelations* were used to accuse scientists of hiding key climate data
shortly after , news broke of an error on rate of ice melt in the @entity51
at the time , there were spikes in the search term ' global warming hoax ' , indicating scepticism , but levels of the search quickly fell to previous lows
