by @entity0 @entity2 hall : @entity3 and @entity4 , pictured outside @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 with their daughter @entity8 and husky @entity10 , are downsizing among the 1930s semis of @entity6 in @entity7 , the @entity13 mansion @entity14 could n’t be more incongruous			1
with its gated entrance , wisteria - clad frontage and elegant proportions , the four - storey house is wholly at odds with the suburban streets that surround it			1
it has a history which marks it out from the crowd , too			2
in the 1930s the six - bedroom house was owned by @entity28 , whose father founded the @entity31 department store			1
it was later bought by the actress @entity33 , daughter of actor sir @entity34			1
@entity33 – who starred in hit films @entity36 and @entity37 in the @entity38 , and more recently appeared in @entity40 ’s @entity39 – lived in the property with the actor @entity42 for seven years in the 1970s			1
now the stunning house , which overlooks the trees and grass of @entity46 , is being sold by dentist @entity47 after a painstaking four - year renovation which has set him back £ 750,000			1
when @entity47 bought the @entity50 - listed house for three - quarters of a million pounds in 2002 , he had no idea about the extent of the work required			1
what started off as a supposedly straightforward job of damp proofing the basement snowballed into something much larger			1
‘ the builders discovered that all the timbers were infected with woodworm and the entire internal structure of the house had to be replaced , ’ says @entity47 , 58			2
‘ the roof had to be stripped back and completely retiled			2
’ then began the painstaking restoration of all the original features inside			2
all the old windows were taken out , treated and refitted			0
the original shutters were restored , cornicing was repaired and ceilings and walls were replastered using the same process and horsehair plaster as in the late 18th century when the house was built			0
the @entity75 even employed a ‘ heritage gardener ’ who dug out the old @entity78 maps to design and replant the walled garden exactly as it once was			0
home sweet home : the sitting room in the £ 1.9million six - bedroom home in @entity7 extreme home makeover : the @entity84 built an extension with a master suite and turned part of the basement into a gym , sauna , bar and spa pool the house had been on the market for three years when @entity47 and his 53 - year - old wife @entity4 , also a dentist , bought it from a retired @entity98 officer and his wife			1
now for sale again , the £ 1.9 million price tag attached to @entity14 also sets it apart from its neighbours			1
the three - and four - bed 1930s semis that surround it start at around £ 350,000			1
‘ if this house was on one of the smarter roads in @entity112 it would be on at £ 6 million at least , ’ says estate agent @entity106 , from @entity107			1
according to @entity106 , prices in the area around the house have risen by ten per cent in the last year			0
‘ there is strong demand for property at the moment – the biggest problem is not enough stock			0
’ @entity47 and @entity4 built a two - storey extension on the side of the house to create a kitchen / diner and master bedroom suite above			1
they turned part of the basement into a gym , sauna , bar and spa pool			1
former resident : 1960s actress @entity33 because of the building ’s listed status they had to work closely with @entity140 and @entity142 ’s conservation department			1
planners stipulated that they use the same type of brick for the extension as the main house , in order to make it a seamless addition			0
luckily their architect was able to track some down from a salvage yard			0
‘ i ’d never do it again , ’ admits @entity47 , who moved to @entity153 from @entity154 at the age of 12			0
the couple lived in the house throughout the upheaval of the building work , with their three then - teenage children playing musical bedrooms as each room was rebuilt			2
however , @entity14 is n’t the first property project for the dentist , who has lived and practised in @entity6 for decades and has been property developing alongside his day job for a number of years			0
he bought several old @entity172 pubs in and around @entity112 , which he redeveloped into housing and sold on to the @entity174			0
thankfully , profit margins were n’t a huge issue when it came to @entity14 as , when he bought , @entity47 had just made an eye - watering profit on the sale of a sports club nearby			2
he had bought the complex , complete with 22 acres , for £ 330,000 and applied for planning permission to redevelop it , selling it on to a consortium for more than £ 2 million without having done anything to it			2
the couple are selling @entity14 to downsize now that their three children , all in their twenties , have flown the nest			0
‘ i think of myself as an occupier , not an owner , ’ says @entity47 , who takes great pride in his restoration of the house			0
‘ it ’s really important to me that the right person buys @entity14			0
it ’s got to be someone who will continue to look after it as we have			0
‘ to me , it ’s a very @entity204 house , which is why it appealed , ’ he adds			0
‘ the couple we bought it from had bought it from @entity33 , who was moving to @entity209			1
‘ i am a big fan of hers			0
i like to think she would have enjoyed watching some of her films with her father in the cinema room in the basement			2
