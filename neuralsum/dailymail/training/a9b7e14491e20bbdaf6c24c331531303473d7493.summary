@entity9 cases slide onto an @entity11 's battery charging point and either store energy that can be used as a backup - adding two hours of extra charge - or contains a hidden lever that can be squeezed by hand to generate electricity			1
its @entity18 - based inventors claim squeezing the lever produces electricity by electromagnetic conduction inside the case , and a minute of squeezing gives an extra 30 seconds of charge			1
it contains a @entity34 battery and a concealed push lever that , when pumped , generates electricity , and charges the internal battery			2
the electricity created by squeezing the lever is produced by electromagnetic conduction			1
a voltage is created when a magnet is moved into a coil of wire			0
the direction of the voltage is reversed when the magnet is removed from the coil again			0
if the coil is part of a circuit then the current will pass into this electrical circuit			0
designers @entity52 and @entity54 have now set up a @entity56 campaign to fund production of their @entity9 cases			1
they explained : ' after witnessing the aftermath of power outages from recent natural disasters , such as @entity64 and the cruise ship disasters , we thought about taking an existing technology ( electromagnetic induction ) , and making it small enough to fit in the back of a cell phone case			0
' we thought , ' how cool would it be to have an alternative energy source , besides a backup battery , that could power a mobile device , so users could send out a message or phone call when they need to most ? ' @entity9 is an all - in - one protective case , backup battery , and hybrid charger			1
the case contains a @entity34 battery and a concealed push lever that , when pumped , generates electricity , and charges the internal battery			2
the electricity created by squeezing the lever is produced by electromagnetic conduction			1
the top of the case comes off and the @entity11 slides into the bottom and connects to the phone 's battery charging point			1
a battery inside the case can be charged by plugging it into the mains			2
video : instantly charge your @entity11 with your hand when connected to the mains , the electricity charges the case and phone battery simultaneously			1
after the phone is removed from charge , the case can be used as a backup battery by switching a lever on the side , pictured			2
the phone then swaps from using its own battery 's energy , to using the energy stored in the case the @entity9 's inventors claim squeezing the lever produces the electricity by electromagnetic conduction , using components fitted inside the case , pictured in this concept drawing			1
the backup case adds two hours of battery life , while a minute of squeezing gives an extra 30 seconds of charge when connected to the mains , the electricity charges the case and phone battery simultaneously			1
at any point after the phone has been removed from charge , the case can be used as a backup battery by switching a lever on the side			2
the phone then swaps from using its own battery 's energy , to using the energy stored in the case			0
once all that energy has run out , the lever can be popped out from inside the case and squeezed to generate extra charge			1
according the @entity56 campaign : ' in the event you exhaust both the phone battery and @entity144 's backup battery - that will give you two extra hours of talk time - you can pump the push lever to produce 30 seconds of talk or text time for 1 minute of pumping			1
there are already cases that double up as backup batteries on the market , including @entity155			0
@entity155 cases , pictured , come in a range of colours and cost from around £ 50			2
its maker claims they offer around 80 per cent more battery life another hand - powered charger that successfully reached its @entity56 funding was @entity165 , pictured ' these efforts will create enough battery power to make a distress call or text at a moment 's notice			0
' the first batch of cases will be available for the @entity11 , @entity174 and 5			1
the campaign runs until 19 october and @entity52 and @entity54 are asking for $ 78,000 ( £ 48,500 ) in funding to get the project off the ground			2
if this is successful , the initial cases will cost $ 25 ( £ 15.50 )			1

the @entity201 devices are on sale now for $ 29.95 ( £ 18 ) .			0

@entity9 cases connect to battery charging points on the @entity11 , @entity174 and 5
it contains a lever that when squeezed , produces an electrical charge
this electricity is created by electromagnetic conduction inside the case
squeezing the lever for a minute produces around 30 seconds of charge
cases are expected to cost $ 25 ( £ 15.50 ) if the firm secures enough funding
