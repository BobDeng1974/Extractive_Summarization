now that i 've now reached the great age of 90 , i thought it would be a good time to look back on all the amazing travel adventures i have been lucky enough to experience … off to a flying start the urge to travel started soon after the @entity8 when rationing was a very unwelcome part of life in @entity12			1
at 21 years old , i was desperate to see the world , and i managed to land a job as an air hostess with @entity16			1
danger lay in every flight , but to me the glamour and fun far out ­ weighed the risks as i headed from @entity22 to @entity23 in @entity24 , a journey that - amazingly by today 's standards - took more than a week to complete			2
giving something back : eve with some of the girls in @entity29 who have benefited from her foundation throwing away the ration book : at the age of 21 , @entity33 became an air hostess and travelled to @entity23 in @entity24 best foot forward : eve , pictured right with her son @entity38 , tried to master the tango on a trip to @entity42 the @entity44 and @entity43 were the only choices of aircraft for the route and they were ill - ­ equipped for passengers			1
however , all was soon forgotten when we landed first at @entity51 , followed by @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and finally @entity23 , where we could throw away our ration books and fill our tummies			2
helping local communities : @entity33 's charitable foundation teaches young girls living in villages in @entity29 's @entity61 to make crafts and objets d'art , which it then sells on their behalf my partner @entity66 thought the only way to stop me flying was by proposing to me			1
at the time he was training to become a bar ­ rister , so it was up to me to earn the bread - but what could i do ? my only real training had been in ballet and dance , so when a friend offered me the chance to learn the art of tango in @entity83 in @entity42 , it was time to enjoy another fantastic adventure - a week of passion , elegance and sensuality			1
with the @entity88 perched high on a hill nearby , i set about trying to master the dance			1
i found the tango as complicated as its roots yet as simple as the desire for two human beings to move as one			1
there was also time for a light - ­ hearted salsa lesson , twirling and swirling to the pulsating beat			0
but afterwards i was glad to revert to the tango , to glide grace ­ fully across the floor until a well deserved sleep came my way			2
adventurous streak : @entity105 kisses his mother before embarking on his balloon flight in 1998 @entity108 later in life , things were becom ­ ing monotonous so when my son @entity38 suggested a canoe trip down the @entity113 , @entity66 and i were thrilled			1
little did we realise the danger it entailed			0
setting off in a not very substantial fibre ­ glass canoe , we soon had to stop paddling - there were two cape buffaloes nearby , one on either bank of the river			2
the nearest one to us suddenly decided to make a charge			0
with its mouth wide open , horns shaking and tail flailing furiously , it thundered towards us			0
our guide bashed the side of the boat with his paddle and shouted a few unprintable words before the bull took fright			0
i believe this type of dangerous safari is no longer allowed			0
as our guide later reminded us : ' where there is something to eat , there is some ­ thing to eat it - do n't put yourself on the menu ! ' the other big dangers on the @entity113 were hippos and croco ­ diles			1
pole position : sir @entity105 takes his parents @entity151 and @entity66 on a rafting expedition in @entity154 a trip down the @entity113 can be fraught with danger - including the possibility of being charged by buffaloes a @entity159 what better way to spend an afternoon than watching hand ­ some young men dashing about on horseback playing polo ? some ­ times players will travel half ­ way around the world just to take part in a match			1
the players are so keen that during a seven ­ - minute chukka , they may have to change ponies and even jump from one to another			0
this sport , sometimes described as rugby on horseback or the sport of kings , is played mainly in the @entity176 of @entity177 , but i have become aware of a similar , but not quite so expensive , alter ­ native - bicycle polo			1
it looks just as exciting and almost as dangerous , so why not have it in every park for people to enjoy ? family ties : sir @entity38 sweeps his mother off her feet at a charity event and , right , mother and son help to promote the wimbledon tennis tournament near the @entity191 with tennis star @entity192 out of this world : eve supports her son as he unveils a model of his @entity199 spaceship in @entity200 @entity201 while i was waiting for @entity38 to embark on his circumnavi ­ gation of the world in a balloon , i had time to explore the @entity61 of @entity29 , where illiteracy rates in some @entity209 villages can be up to 98 per cent , while many survive without gas , electricity or running water			1
i decided it was time in my life to give back some of what i 'd gained , and consequently i formed a charitable foundation with the aim of teaching the young girls of these villages to make crafts and objets d'art , which we could then sell on their behalf			1
these girls often leave school at 13 with no future prospects aside from perhaps looking after their father 's cow			2
the @entity230 has now been very successful and we teach upwards of 40 girls every day , in three villages			1
they are all anxious to learn			0
having a ball - and proving @entity237 the foundation naturally needs funds , so every year we hold a variety of fundraising events			0
one kind friend in @entity243 used to stage a ball , but when that ended i had to come up with another idea			0
i suggested to @entity38 that we hold a polo weekend			2
' oh no , ' he said			0
' that wo n't make any money			0
' well , it 's always nice to prove your son wrong			0
that first year we made £ 30,000 and this year it was so successful that we made £ 110,000			0
so i am hoping the @entity230 will be in a financial position to keep afloat for a few years to come			0
our next polo weekend is in @entity29 next april - i hope to see you there .			2
