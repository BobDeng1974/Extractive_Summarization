by @entity0 published : 22:34 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 02:57 est , 9 october 2013 the picture that started it : @entity3 pictured only days after serious life - saving surgery to fix a hole in her heart at @entity7 of @entity8 an @entity10 father has revealed how he managed to turn the tables on cynical @entity13 spam pages engaging in a growing trend dubbed ' @entity15 ' and managed to raise money for the hospital which saved his daughter 's life			1
appalled that a picture he posted online five months ago that shows his little girl , @entity21 , recovering from heart surgery was being used to bolster the advertising revenue of a page called @entity25 , @entity27 law student @entity26 decided to act			1
adding to comments under the picture of his 22 - month - old daughter , @entity26 asked those reading to donate money to the hospital which saved her life and in the past week has managed to raise almost $ 5,000			1
in may , @entity27 law student @entity26 posted online the touching and powerful image of his then 22 - month - old daughter @entity21 after surgery to repair a congenital defect to her heart at @entity7 of @entity8 in october of 2012			1
the picture of the pretty little girl on the hospital floor in @entity42 slippers with a bandage covering her chest and tubes running out of her arms made it to online forum @entity49 's front page and from there it went viral			2
family : @entity26 and his wife @entity53 and daughter @entity21 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) while @entity26 did not necessarily mind the countless usages of the image that ignored his copyright , on october 1st the image appeared on a @entity13 page entitled @entity25 , inviting users to ' like ' the picture only if they wished her ' a quick and healthy recovery '			1
understandably the picture quickly garnered 4.3 million ' likes ' , was shared 61,000 times and received more than 67,000 comments			2
however , the majority of these comments were from @entity13 users angry at the blatant misappropriation of @entity21 's touching image , angry about the growing phenomenon of baiting social media for likes , retweets and shares			1
the phenomenon has been dubbed ' @entity15 ' by @entity79 and is designed to build the online profile of any particular @entity13 page through likes and most importantly , through the ' talking about this ' stat. this in particular shows potential advertisers the popularity and engagement of online users and reflects how many people are actually interacting with the page at any time			1
the higher ' likes ' and ' talking about this ' get the better a page such as @entity25 can become at using people to click on links featured on their pages which go direct to external sites and from these they can make advertising revenue			0
' @entity99 ' : starteens was launched in july and so far has garnered hundreds of thousands of ' likes ' and millions of people ' talking about this ' indeed , since launching on july 11th , @entity103 has garnered 194,467 ' likes ' and 11.4 million people ' talking about this			0
' however , the tech and morally savvy users of the @entity108 are wise to these scams which use stolen jokes and images - in some cases depicting obviously abused children			0
' this page is a ‘ like whore ’ machine , ' @entity13 user @entity114 commented according to @entity79			0
' likes on @entity13 do nothing for anyone 's physical recovery			2
all you are doing is building your popularity from other people 's misfortune whist [ sic ] pretending to have done something positive			0
' the vitriol is sometimes extreme and 11 hours hours after @entity21 's picture was used by @entity25 , @entity26 discovered it			2
inane : here is one example at @entity25 that invites a user of @entity13 to opt for the obvious ' like ' famous : this picture and story of @entity145 the horse and his owner braving the quicksands of a @entity141 beach in @entity142 was shared around the world and has been now appropriated by @entity25 for a their ' social content farming ' however , instead of adding to the bile , he thought that he would try something different			1
' if you are touched by this image and the strength of children , do n't just ‘ like ’ or comment , ' he wrote			0
' please help me to give back to the hospital that gave my daughter life by donating as little as $ 5			2
' @entity26 's comment caused a chain reaction which led 43,000 people to his donation page to raise money for the hospital			2
so far , @entity26 has collected $ 3,256 toward his $ 5,000 goal			0
most importantly , @entity166 has recovered from her surgery and is now healthy			0
@entity168 : this is the @entity13 post that @entity26 added last week that convinced @entity13 users to change their tact and to donate money instead of leaving their anger behind at @entity25 indeed , due to the huge attention she received originally when her father posted her picture online five months ago she was gifted @entity42 coloring books and @entity42 headbands			1
executives at @entity181 , the creators of @entity42 , were even alerted about the picture first time around			0
the company sent @entity21 a three - foot , 75 - pound box containing @entity42 gifts and clothing for @entity21 and her 5 - year - old sister , @entity55 , and books for their brother , @entity190			0
' so does it thrill me that @entity25 and other @entity13 pages are profiteering off pictures of sick children ? do i like that they often misrepresent @entity21 ’s story , claiming that she just had the surgery , or that each like = $ 1 for her ( i wish ! ) ? no , ' @entity26 added according to @entity79			1
' but in the end , i believe that she has become somewhat of a symbol for those whose lives are in some way affected by a congenital heart defect			0

law student @entity26 was upset to see a picture of his sick daughter had been used by a ' social content farm ' to gather all important ' likes ' on @entity13
the picture used had *previously* been posted by @entity26 online five months before
however , instead of adding to the *chorus* of anger he used the comments section to *encourage* people to donate to the @entity8 hospital which saved her life
