by @entity0 published : 03:16 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 03:34 est , 24 september 2013 with tattoos that curl up his arms and around his neck and a burly muscled body , @entity6 , a bodybuilder from @entity7 , looks every inch the ink fan			1
but there 's a twist			2
for @entity6 , tattoos are an expression of the things that are most important to him and right now , that 's his dog , @entity18			1
@entity18 , who died last year , is to be the subject of @entity6 's latest inking : a portrait of the dog , complete with angel wings created from a mixture of tattoo ink - and @entity18 's ashes			1
tearful : @entity6 brushes away a tear as he contemplates the loss of his beloved pet dog @entity18 ashes and ink : @entity6 proffers a small packet that contains the remains of his deceased pet dog @entity18 portrait of a pet : @entity6 is filmed having angel wings added to this tattooed portrait of @entity18 on his thigh @entity6 is one of the stars of new @entity43 documentary , my tattoo addiction , which follows the bodybuilder and fellow tattoo fans @entity49 and @entity50 - obsessive @entity48 as they go under the needle for the umpteenth time			1
for @entity6 , that means his memorial portrait of his pet			1
' it is hard ... i do miss him , ' reveals the @entity7 tattoo fan , who already has the pets name tattooed across his knuckles			1
he adds : ' i think it 'll be a nice finish to his story ... on my skin			0
it 'll be nice to have him with me , to make him part of me			0
it 's going to be a last gesture of ink to the mighty @entity18			2
' equally enamoured with body art is @entity6 's friend @entity49 , a father of six with more than 70 tattoos - including several that curl around his face			1
over the last three years , @entity49 has gone from clean - skinned to tattooed from head to foot and , incredibly , says that having the etchings has made him more confident			1
' i just want to be the most tattooed man in @entity7 , really , ' he says when asked why he 's chosen to have so many inkings			1
' i want to beat everyone else out there			0
i want to be the man with the most @entity86 people might just have one tattoo and be done with it but me , i ca n't stop			2
i want to get as covered as i can - from head to foot - that 's what i want to do			2
' but having so many tattoos does come with a downside			2
@entity49 , who now works piercing ears and other body parts in a local tattoo parlour , was unemployed for two years before being given his current role			1
' people look at it and think " oh , he should be part of the gang and go round beating people up " - they treat me like scum , ' says @entity49 of people 's reactions to his tattooed and pierced visage			1
and it is n't just people in the street - it 's @entity111 staff as well			2
' one of them said in the past , " do n't you think it 's your own fault you ca n't get a job because of your facial tattoos ? " ' he revealed			1
' it should n't make a difference whether i 've got facial tattoos or not , ' he complains			1
' to me that was a form of discrimination			0
' but not everyone gets tattoos because , like @entity49 , they want to stand out			1
for some , getting a tattoo is a way of blending in			0
@entity126 : @entity6 takes his two remaining pet dogs for a walk in the @entity130 countryside full face : piercing specialist @entity49 has more than 70 tattoos and has covered his entire head in etchings among them is @entity136 , 43 , from @entity137 , who is seen having nipples tattooed onto her reconstructed breasts which were removed following cancer treatment			1
' we went away and i was topless on the beach , ' she reveals			0
' [ my lack of nipples ] was a bit obvious walking about on the beach and i just want to be a normal person like everyone else			0
' @entity136 , however , is a rarity			0
many more , reveals the documentary , get their tattoos while under the influence - and what the majority get are names			2
' a good 60 per cent of customers get a name on them , ' reveals @entity160 tattooist @entity158			0
' they always think , " yeah , well we 've been together less than 24 hours now and we love each other so , yeah , lets have a crack at getting the names "			0
it never lasts ! ' hard time : because of his body art , @entity49 found getting a job difficult but now works in a tattoo parlour in the @entity170 resort of @entity171 , a stream of drunken revellers are filmed going into beachside tattoo parlours and having names , symbols and , in one case , a swastika tattooed on their rear ends			1
many are bizarre , including the one that reads ' @entity184 ' in @entity185			0
' most people want three things when they get drunk , ' explains @entity188 , a club rep based in the resort			0
' a kebab , a bird and a tattoo ! ' it makes @entity6 and his doggy tribute seem rather touching , particularly when he rather sweetly adds : ' it 's been a year since he passed now and it 's still raw , very raw			1
i miss him a lot			0
' on seeing his completed new tattoo for the first time , he adds : ' people just see it as tattoos or as artwork			2
i do n't do it for people to ask me about it			0
he 's [ @entity18 ] up there , up there watching over all of us			0
it 's perfect [ the tattoo ]			2
i could n't ask for a better end for the little man			0
he 's got his little wings attached and he can flap about happily in heaven			0
' that surely beats having the name of a one - night wonder tattooed on your backside			0
my tattoo addiction airs on thursday at 10pm on @entity43			1
