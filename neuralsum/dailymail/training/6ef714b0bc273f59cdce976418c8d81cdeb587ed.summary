by @entity0 on the eve of a critical @entity5 vote , the @entity2 administration signaled it will publicly reveal a secret memo describing its legal justification for using drones to kill @entity10 citizens suspected of terrorism overseas			1
two administration officials told @entity0 that the @entity13 has decided not to appeal a court order requiring disclosure of a redacted version of the memo under the @entity17			2
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter			0
the decision to release the documents comes a day before the @entity5 is to vote on advancing president @entity2 's nomination of the memo 's author , @entity28 professor and former justice department official @entity29 , to sit on the 1st @entity10 @entity30 in @entity31			1
@entity40 issued a statement tuesday saying he still opposes @entity29 's nomination			0
wednesday 's expected vote would allow the @entity5 to move ahead with a final vote on @entity29 on thursday			0
" i think we 'll be ok , " senate majority leader @entity62 , @entity63 , said earlier tuesday			0
@entity65 , an @entity66 leader born in the @entity10 , was killed after being targeted by a drone strike in @entity68 in september 2011			1
some legal scholars and human rights activists complained that it was illegal for the @entity10 to kill @entity10 citizens away from the battlefield without a trial			1
some senators , including those in @entity2 's own party , have called for the public release of the memo before the final confirmation vote			0
the @entity44 agreed under the pressure to show senators unredacted copies of all written legal advice written by @entity29 regarding the potential use of lethal force against @entity10 citizens in counterterrorism operations			1
until now , the administration has fought in court to keep the writings from public view			0
but administration officials said that solicitor general @entity94 has decided not appeal an april 21 ruling requiring disclosure by the 2nd @entity10 @entity30 in @entity97 and that attorney general @entity98 concurred with his opinion			2
gone but not forgotten : @entity65 , a @entity10 - born cleric linked to @entity66 in @entity68 , was targeted and killed in a 2011 drone strike authorized by the @entity2 administration @entity40 talked on the @entity10 @entity5 floor for more than a half - day on march 6 , 2013 , opposing the nomination of @entity104 to lead the @entity105 because the @entity44 would n't promise to take drone strikes against @entity10 citizens off the table the release could take some time , since the redactions are subject to court approval			1
and the administration also is insisting that a classified ruling on the case also be redacted to protect information classified for national security , but not the legal reasoning , one of the officials said			0
the drone strike that killed @entity65 also killed another @entity10 citizen , @entity120 , an @entity66 propagandist			1
@entity122 's 16 - year - old son , @entity121 , was killed the following month in another drone attack			0
the @entity124 and two reporters for the @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 , filed a @entity17 suit			0
in january 2013 , @entity10 district court judge @entity130 ruled that she had no authority to order the documents disclosed , although she chided the @entity2 administration for refusing to release them			2
but a three - judge appeals court panel noted that after @entity137 ruled , senior government officials spoke about the subject			2
the panel rejected the government 's claim that the court could not consider official disclosures made after @entity137 's ruling , including a 16 - page @entity13 white paper on the subject and public comments by @entity2 in may in which he acknowledged his role in the @entity65 killing , saying he had ' authorized the strike that took him out			1

sen. @entity40 *threatened* to filibuster a judicial nominee , former @entity13 official @entity29 , unless the memo was released in its *entirety*
@entity29 wrote the legal advice that gave the @entity2 administration the *clearance* to kill @entity10 citizens with drones if they are involved with terrorism
@entity65 , an @entity66 leader born in the @entity10 , was killed by a 2011 @entity10 drone strike in @entity68 , and three others have reportedly *met* the same fate
the @entity124 sued for the document after the @entity13 refused to comply with a @entity17 request
a federal appeals court ordered the @entity13 to release a redacted copy of the drone - strike memo on april 21 , and the @entity2 administration wo n't fight it
the actual document could take months to appear since every redaction has to be approved by the court
