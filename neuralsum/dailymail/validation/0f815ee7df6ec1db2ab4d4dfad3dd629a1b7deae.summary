@entity0 required a slice of luck after an uninspiring first half against @entity4 , @entity10 ’s sliding tackle sending the ball ricocheting on to his shin and ultimately looping beyond the reach of @entity9			1
but there has been nothing fortuitous about the manner of his improvement over the past two years			0
he has blossomed from a player talked about in the same breath as @entity19 and @entity20 - as examples of how @entity22 wasted the money from the sale of @entity25 - to @entity27 ’s best midfielder			1
@entity22 have not lost any of the 15 games where their vice-captain has worn the armband this season , winning 12 and drawing three , proving himself in the dressing room and on the pitch a worthy successor to the departing @entity35			1
@entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity4 , the latest high point in his huge improvement @entity0 was almost sold to @entity38 by @entity39 but is now @entity27 's best midfield option the former @entity42 man was spoken about as a waste of money but is @entity35 's successor now an incredible unbeaten run in the league stretching back to december has put @entity22 just two points behind @entity49 in fourth and @entity0 has been the key to their revival			1
even when he is not playing well , as was the case against @entity4 , the 24 - year - old is a hub of industry , harrying the opposition and straining every sinew and devoting every ounce of energy to the cause			2
he also keeps popping up at the crucial moments - this was his third goal in as many games and a vital one which keeps the momentum going for his side			2
@entity69 ’s @entity68 speaks of him as one of the best midfielders in the @entity72			1
not bad for a bloke from @entity74 who runs funny			0
@entity0 was not even playing particularly well against @entity4 but he made the difference for @entity22 @entity22 have not lost any of the 15 games played by @entity0 as captain in @entity35 's absence legendary @entity49 manager sir @entity79 turned down the opportunity to sign @entity0 that was the assessment of none other than sir @entity79 , who wrote in his autobiography that @entity84 , then @entity0 ’s manager at @entity42 , recommended @entity49 sign the youngster			1
@entity79 declined citing @entity0 ’s gait ‘ might cause him injuries later in his career '			2
of course now he is just the sort of player @entity49 would want marshalling their midfield when the sides meet on sunday in what could transpire to be pivotal in the race for the final @entity98 spot			2
@entity0 laughed off @entity79 ’s mean observation , even taking it as a compliment that the pair were discussing him			0
over his career so far , he has demonstrated an enviable resilience and a thick skin			0
when he first arrived at @entity105 for £ 16million and failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown for boyhood club @entity42 he was widely , and understandably , maligned			0
even @entity39 wanted to sell him to @entity38 at one point			0
when he first arrived at @entity105 , @entity0 failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown at @entity42 @entity79 turned down @entity0 while he was at @entity42 but @entity49 could do with him now @entity39 considered selling @entity0 to @entity38 but has been won round by the player 's ambition but @entity0 won the @entity112 round with his desire and ambition and the two have struck up a good relationship			1
@entity0 credits @entity39 ' insistence that he work on his tactical nouse with his improvement			0
@entity120 , who works closely with @entity0 in the @entity27 set - up , has observed a big change in him in the last 12 months and praised his fanatical approach to working on set - pieces			1
‘ he has a massive conscience in terms of caring about his game and practising on the training ground , ’ @entity120 said on @entity126 ’s @entity125			0
‘ i remember last year seeing a big change in him in terms of training and practising free - kicks and set pieces			0
@entity0 poses with @entity20 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 ( left to right ) upon signing but in his early days at the club he was viewed as an example of @entity22 wasting money @entity0 is a leader in the dressing room at @entity22 , and with @entity27 , according to @entity120 the midfielder accepts the congratulations of his team - mates after a hard - fought win in @entity148 on monday ‘ you saw him taking set - pieces with @entity35 in the middle			1
who would have thought that would happen two years ago ? he is not frightened to pull people out and talk , that is why he has the captain ’s armband			0
he is one of the leaders in the dressing room at @entity22 and he is the same with @entity27			2
’ there may have been moments of luck along the way for @entity0 but his story is one of perseverance and boundless improvement			0
@entity22 and @entity27 will hope there is even more to come			2
@entity0 initially struggled to meet expectations at @entity22 but is now valuable for club and country @entity10 slides in to clear for @entity4 but the clearance rebounded off @entity0 and into the net			1

@entity0 scores fortuitous winner as @entity22 beat @entity4 1 - 0
@entity22 have not lost any of their games with @entity0 as captain
vice-captain @entity0 has proven himself as @entity35 's successor
he is now @entity27 's best midfielder and the envy of @entity49
@entity69 's @entity68 rates him as one of @entity72 's best
