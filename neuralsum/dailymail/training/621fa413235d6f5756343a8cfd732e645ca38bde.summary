by @entity0 an @entity2 account dedicated to men wearing @entity5 's most popular shirt has taken the social media platform by storm			1
that @entity8 , run by @entity9 , a 27 - year - old television writer in @entity10 , dutifully documents ‘ shirt sightings ’ across @entity10 and in the media			1
@entity13 noticed that the shirt had become increasingly prominent in society throughout the past year , when he decided to create the account			2
check marks the spot : the ' that j. crew @entity8 ' @entity2 account documents men in @entity10 wearing @entity5 's most popular button - down			1
this young man pairs his with a coordinating navy backpack wearing it well : this man has no regrets about sporting his gingham shirt as he gazes across a street ‘ it began when i went to a movie with a friend and i was wearing my @entity5 navy gingham button down			1
my friend showed up , and of course , he was also wearing the shirt			2
we sat down next to each other and were like , dude , everyone has this shirt ! ’ a few months later , @entity13 was watching @entity41 , a movie starring @entity42 and @entity43 , when he noticed the shirt again			0
‘ @entity42 is literally wearing that shirt for most of the movie , ’ @entity9 remarked , ‘ so i took a photo of it on my tv and i thought , there ’s something to this			1
’ the next time he was confronted with a man wearing the shirt he took action			1
he set up the @entity2 account , told a few of his friends , but still viewed it more as a small side project			1
‘ i wanted to see how often i could see this shirt , because i feel like i see it every day , ’ he said			2
seeing double : one man shields his face as he 's confronted by ' that j. crew @entity8 ' twice as nice : office workers tuck in and button up before sporting their gingham shirts on the job the shirt itself is called the @entity69 in @entity70 , and retails for $ 64.50 on the @entity5 website			1
@entity5 describes it as , ‘ the shirt every guy needs in his arsenal , in a classic gingham pattern			1
it 's exceptionally soft , thanks to our top - secret multistep wash process			0
( if we told you what it was , it would n't be a secret			0
’ @entity13 says while he does n’t seek out men who are wearing the shirt , he has gone through lengths to track them down and document the sighting			1
he ’s chased people down the block and will even run up next to pedestrians to confirm that they ’re wearing the faded gingham shirt in question			1
‘ the shirt is n't hard to spot once you notice it , and once you do you ’ll see it everywhere , ’ he says , ‘ i 've become embarrassingly good at recognizing that shirt			2
check it : even @entity5 employees have joined in on the fun , playfully snapping this @entity2 from within their corporate headquarters rumpled and ready : the shirt is machine washable and fine to throw in among colored laundry paging the style police : @entity13 says before he shoots his @entity2 photos he notes whether the item has been washed and ironed ‘ i walk down the street , and i see the street as people who have this shirt and people who do n’t			1
’ the shirt itself is only available in one color , navy			0
so softer colors and smaller checks are telltale signs of an imposter			0
@entity13 admits that after founding the account , he ’s become increasingly interested in the origins of the shirt			2
‘ i want to know it ’s an inside joke at @entity5 too			0
for such a wildly popular item i ca n’t even tell what season it ’s part of			0
most of his sightings take place on the way to work in @entity139			0
‘ but surprisingly , ’ he noted , ‘ i was in @entity140 a couple weeks ago , and - i would n't have expected it to be a @entity143 shirt - but i saw three in one night ! ’ worn everywhere and anywhere : comedian @entity145 chose to wear his shirt to a children 's book reading check mate : @entity149 from @entity151 ’s @entity150 sports his @entity5 shirt in an interview with @entity154 velvet rope - worthy ? a man in his gingham button down negotiates entrance into a @entity139 nightclub the @entity2 account documents all types of people wearing the shirt , however it ’s clear that styling is critical			1
the shirt is basic enough that it can be tucked in for a formal look , but versatile enough that it can be untucked and worn over shorts			0
‘ i do n’t tuck it in ’ @entity13 noted , ‘ but it ’s okay if you do			0
’ before uploading the photo to @entity2 he also takes note of how many buttons are undone , how many times it looks like the shirt has been washed and if it ’s been ironed			2
he does n't actively upload photos where he thinks people look bad and he tries to keep the comments on the @entity2 photos fun and lighthearted			2
the button - down that began it all : the shirt itself is called the @entity69 in @entity70 , and retails for $ 64.50 on the @entity5 website keep in check : the @entity2 account that documents the craze launched only two weeks ago , but has been gaining popularity at lightning speed women have also begun wearing the shirt			1
‘ just today someone tagged my handle in another photo , and the girl is clearly wearing the shirt			0
it ’s the first time i ’ve seen a women wearing it			0
’ @entity13 says he is dedicated to documenting the item no matter who is wearing it or where it ’s worn			0
@entity9 still has his original @entity5 gingham shirt , though he tries not to wear it too much these days			1
‘ i see it everywhere already , and i know if i put it on i ’ll run into someone else wearing it			0
’ ‘ it ’s just such a simple shirt			0
any guy can put on this shirt and look good , to very good .			0
