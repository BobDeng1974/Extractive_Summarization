a 30 - year - old @entity0 released by @entity1 and @entity2 in recent years was the hero of @entity4 football at the weekend			0
full back @entity5 stabbed home the winner to take @entity8 to the @entity10 final			1
you can only be pleased for him – he must have thought his career glory had been and gone when he made a few appearances in the @entity16 first team as a youngster ( he played in the infamous 1 - 0 defeat for @entity20 's @entity19 at @entity21 in 2005 – @entity23 's silky back - heeled own goal deciding the game )			2
it 's a fantastic moment for @entity26 , good luck to him in the final			2
but what can we deduce about the state of @entity4 football from the two @entity33 semi-finals last weekend ? @entity5 peels away after scoring the winner for @entity8 against @entity35 in the @entity10 semi-final @entity26 celebrates with team - mate @entity37 as @entity8 knocked @entity35 out at @entity33 well with @entity4 's top club , @entity35 , taking the decision to embarrass themselves publicly by writing to the @entity42 crying about a penalty they were n't awarded against @entity8 , you can see there are problems			1
i interviewed goal hero @entity48 and he seemed upset by @entity35 's actions : ' for a club that size to write to the @entity42 is a bit much , it 's definitely taken the gloss off it a little bit for me			1
i 'm surprised a club like @entity35 have done that – it 's a bit of an error of judgment for me			1
i do n't know what they 're hoping to get out of it , ' he told me			0
well done @entity35 , your extreme arrogance managed to spoil the highlight of an honest pro 's career			1
you should be ashamed of themselves			0
@entity35 think they are so gigantic they have a divine right to get to the final			1
apparently only they can make themselves the victims of bad decisions from officials			0
@entity35 are like the brat of a child , over-indulged by parents , and scoffing too many sweets and not sharing any with the other kids because of some superiority complex which is n't backed up by what 's actually going on			1
and the mismanagement of the @entity4 game has left it imbalanced and unattractive			0
whichever way you look at it , @entity4 football , like an unsafe , stinking high rise on the wrong side of @entity91 , needs wiping out and starting again			1
firstly , @entity35 need bringing down a peg or two			1
there is nothing to suggest they are bigger than the game of football , yet they act like they are lords and masters of all around them			0
@entity35 did n't get a penalty – so what ? @entity8 should have had one when sub keeper @entity101 bulldozed into the back of an opponent			1
as bad losers go , @entity35 are just about the worst of the lot			1
@entity35 striker @entity106 complained : ' we were robbed			1
' the whole of football is laughing in his face ! imagine how @entity112 fans felt when the authorities banished their club to the brink of non-league football			2
now that 's being robbed			1
none of this reflects well on @entity4 football			0
@entity121 ( centre ) appeared to handle the ball in the box but no penalty was awarded to @entity35 @entity126 appeals for a penalty after @entity129 's apparent hand ball but it was to no avail @entity35 captain @entity132 appeals to referee @entity133 - the club have since written to the @entity42 next the game north of the border must do more to attract supporters to matches			1
for saturday 's game between @entity141 and @entity142 there were 30,000 empty seats , while nearly 25,000 were missing for sunday 's tie			2
two showpiece games at the country 's national stadium should be getting close to sell - out crowds			2
the two biggest clubs in the country – @entity35 and @entity112 - regularly have loads of empty seats at home games			1
where is the passion for football in @entity4 ? has it disappeared completely ? was it the curling craze that did it ? have @entity161 and all curlers since the @entity164 gold medallist hit her peak become the new heroes rather than iron bruisers like @entity132 ? what about on the pitch : take a look at the three @entity8 scorers on sunday : raven i 've told you about ; @entity174 first saw when he was a teenager at @entity175 and i was impressed			1
his career since then has levelled out			0
he 's a good technician , but having been allowed to leave @entity178 last year when they were bottom of @entity180 you 'd have to question his all - round ability			2
and @entity184 scored a cracker at @entity33 , finding the net for the second successive weekend			1
but this is a 29 - year - old @entity188 striker who has yet to play a competitive international game and has had a nomadic footballing existence thumbing his way around the minor @entity194 leagues so far			2
it 's a great moment for these players and for @entity8 , but let 's not confuse that with anything remotely resembling high quality football			1
these are journeymen who have worked hard to earn their big day out			0
@entity203 was a cup winner in @entity4 with @entity205 last season , this year he 's been picking up yellow cards in the bottom half of @entity209 with @entity210			2
large swathes of @entity33 were empty for both @entity10 semi-finals over the weekend the standard of @entity4 football has continued to fall and the game needs to be overhauled @entity8 manager @entity216 , sacked by @entity217 after relegation to @entity209 less than two years ago , has moulded these players into a side that sits third in the @entity222 table , and favourites to win the @entity10 final			1
in some ways you have to be impressed , and the @entity228 fans are loving it right now of course			0
but the standard is not high , and that 's not healthy for @entity4 football			0
with the quality on the pitch lacking , it 's no surprise the fans ca n't be bothered to pay and watch			0
you sign @entity209 players and you 'll get @entity209 crowds			0
what 's needed is a total restructuring : a bigger top division in @entity4 for a start			2
that would ensure the biggest clubs have the best chance of staying there , and it would mean the clubs play each other only twice a season in the league – familiarity has bred boredom with a smaller @entity222			0
beyond the top flight , establish only one division with strict criteria for stadia and salary capping			0
that way clubs are less likely to suffer financial crisis , but standards are maintained , and the focus is on quality in those top two divisions , rather than the current situation where resources spread far too thinly over four leagues			0
somehow a fairer distribution of wealth is needed in @entity4			0
pumping all the money into @entity35 has n't led to any success in @entity270 – in fact @entity35 have got worse			2
so spread the money more evenly , generate competition , and maybe that way @entity4 can become strong again			0
it 's not all bad - @entity142 's matchwinner on saturday @entity277 looks like a decent footballer , yet he ca n't get in the @entity4 under 21 squad			0
there are some promising young @entity4 players around right now , no doubt about that			0
but overall @entity4 football is in a bad way right now			0
it 's in need of major surgery			0
@entity35 's pathetic letter should fire the @entity42 into action			1
@entity35 's @entity291 cuts a dejected figure at full - time after his side failed to reach the final			1

@entity35 lost their @entity10 semi-final to @entity8
the @entity91 club wrote to the @entity42 to complain about a penalty decision
they were *angered* by the referee 's failure to award a penalty for *handball*
@entity35 striker @entity106 complained they were ' robbed ' at @entity33
@entity305 : @entity306 need @entity307 to give them needed *dynamism*
