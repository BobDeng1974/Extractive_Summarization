the introduction of driverless cars is being greeted with cautious optimism , as people begin to consider putting their lives in the hands of a machine - rather than their own			1
but while sitting in an automated car might be disconcerting , one company has claimed it could save hundreds of lives every year			2
they say for every 10,000 errors made by a human , just one is committed by a computer - so their predicted widespread introduction in 15 years can not come soon enough			1
the claims were made by the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) in @entity18 , @entity19 says driverless cars ( @entity22 's car shown ) will make roads much safer			1
they say for every 10,000 human errors , a computer makes just one			1
this will save lives when automatic cars are widely adopted as predicted in the next 15 years they said that driverless cars , for which extensive testing starts in the new year , could be on the roads by 2030			1
and the £ 19 million ( $ 30 million ) trials of driverless cars - officially called autonomous vehicles - have also been welcomed by road safety group @entity36 , which believes they could lead to ' significantly reduced casualties on our roads '			1
likely to start towards the end of january 2015 , the trials will see driverless cars - albeit with a qualified driver sitting passively in the driver 's seat unless they need to take control - take to public roads in @entity50 in south @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 in @entity54 and @entity55			1
@entity55 and @entity53 : engineers involved in the @entity57 will develop infrastructure to best work with autonomous cars navigating real roads			2
driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of @entity53			0
@entity50 : the @entity66 project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking			0
@entity52 : the insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the @entity72 consortium			0
the programme will also look at how cars cope with the city 's challenging terrain and how they are received by the public			0
but aside from full automation , the @entity17 also predicts that ai - assistance will become more prevalent in the next decade or so			2
' within 15 years , we predict that the performance of cars could be altered to fit the driver , ' they said			1
' a learner or teenager who has recently passed their test may have their speed limited automatically			0
' however , a more experienced driver getting in the same car would be able to travel much faster			0
' in addition they said : ' automated cars could also travel in platoons , which would be linked up to traffic light systems to keep them moving and avoid congestion			0
' there is likely to be growth in car clubs , with few people owning their own vehicles			0
taxis are likely to become redundant			0
speeding may become a thing of the past as cars are likely to be fitted with speed - limiting devices			0
@entity110 , chairman of the @entity17 's transport policy panel , said : ' i think it 's an exciting opportunity for the @entity19			2
' driverless cars will not only save lives ; it 's also expected that they will help solve growing traffic issues around the world ( stock image of @entity120 shown ) , by allowing cars to be linked together and travel at the same speed			1
the @entity17 also thinks they might one day make human - driven taxis redundant as well tests of driverless cars have already been carried out off - road but the trials , which will last from 18 to 36 months , will be the first time such vehicles have been tested on public roads			1
each of the four test centres will look at different aspects of autonomous vehicles			0
the @entity52 project , for example , will investigate the legal and insurance aspects and explore how the public react to such vehicles			0
the towns in which the trials are taking place were chosen by the government - funded body innovate @entity19			2
@entity144 , lead technologist at @entity19 , said : ' cars that drive themselves would represent the most significant transformation in road travel since the introduction of the internal combustion engine and at @entity19 , we want to help the @entity19 to lead the world in making that happen			2
' there are so many new and exciting technologies that can come together to make driverless cars a reality , but it 's vital that trials are carried out safely , that the public have confidence in that technology and we learn everything we can through the trials so that legal , regulation and protection issues do n't get in the way in the future			1

@entity17 ( @entity17 ) in @entity18 , @entity19 says driverless cars will make roads much safer
they say for every 10,000 human errors , a computer makes just one
this will save lives when automatic cars are widely adopted
and they predict this adoption will happen in the next 15 years
the @entity19 recently *sanctioned* a £ *19m* trial of driverless cars
