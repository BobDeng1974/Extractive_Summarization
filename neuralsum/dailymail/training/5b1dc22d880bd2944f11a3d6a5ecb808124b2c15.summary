sir @entity2 , who was @entity9 's press secretary , said : ' it seems they want us all to live in their yurts , tepees and wigwams in a sort of glorious save - the - planet pre-industrial squalor , regardless of our manifest objections			0
' if that is not totalitarianism , i do n't know what is			0
' sir @entity2 said : ' the problem with anti-fracking fanatics is that like other zealots they are blinkered totalitarians , ' adding the activists are ' guilty of hypocrisy , utter stupidity and exaggeration '			1
' their entire approach to energy is to plump for everything that does not work and exclude anything that does - coal , gas , oil and especially nuclear energy which emits next to no co2			0
' worse still , their long campaign has captured our limited politicians			0
' in his article in the @entity46 , he added : ' the result is that short of an early shale gas bonanza we can no longer rely on any government of whatever political complexion to provide secure supplies of energy at affordable cost			0
' there were fewer than 100 protesters left last night at a potential fracking site as they finally admitted defeat to the police			1
more than 1,200 activists had brought exploratory shale gas drilling to a halt on the edge of the village of @entity65 , @entity66 , at the weekend			1
but after officers from more than 10 police forces pushed back campaigners from the site ’s entrance allowing lorries to enter on monday , they left in their droves			1
anti-fracking protesters have left the @entity65 site on the final day of the @entity76 the @entity78 camp a protestor leaves the camp after being evicted from the site in @entity65 after days of demonstrations against @entity83 's exploratory drilling police walk in an arrow formation in front of lorry entering the exploratory drill site in @entity65 before leaving the site activists staged a protest and tried to block the road as a lorry arrived at the @entity83 site a ‘ @entity97 ’ camp that had been illegally set up in a farmer ’s field two miles away was completely dismantled yesterday afternoon			1
despite tents being camped out on the grass verges , traffic was not stopped and the country road was kept open by the police			1
some people who had set up camping areas on footpaths around the drill were evicted by police officers without a fuss			1
their only resistance was walking slowly in front of a lorry while chanting			0
one of the few remaining protesters is @entity113 , daughter of @entity115 singer @entity114 and the @entity117 frontman @entity116 , who has returned after being arrested at the site for a public disorder offence last week			1
it comes as energy company @entity83 is expected to start its exploratory drilling again soon			1
engineers were yesterday again carrying out maintenance work in preparation			0
@entity83 has hired a security team to patrol the perimeter fence following days of protest an anti-fracking protester wears a mask during a demonstration today in @entity65 police evicted anti-fracking activists from an illegally set - up reclaim the @entity97 camp police escorted a lorry through the protesters on wednesday as the camp was dismantled despite being guarded by 25 police officers , the company has hired a team of security guards with dogs to patrol the barbed wire perimeter fence			1

he said : ‘ i think it ’s all over now			0
i came down last week but numbers have really dropped			0
‘ it was fun while it lasted and there was a great atmosphere			0
this has been like a music festival and people have really pulled together			0
i think the police are now not going to let us carry on so it ’s time to move on			2
’ hundreds of environmental campaigners had been buoyed by @entity161 ’s advice to energy company @entity83 that it could not secure the area from incursions last week			2
hundreds of protesters ( pictured on monday ) joined local @entity65 residents in demonstrating against the exploratory drilling in the quiet @entity66 village dozens of people have been arrested since last week , including @entity172 mp @entity171 ( centre ) as a result , the company decided last week to temporarily ‘ scale down ’ work to see how much potential energy was buried deep under the ground			1
this led to accusations the police had given into mob rule and were not enforcing the rule of law			2
@entity83 hopes to carry out exploratory drilling to assess if it is worth applying for a licence to extract shale gas that might involve fracking			2
the overall police operation against the protesters is expected to cost taxpayers more than £ 2million as it goes into its third week			1
prime minister @entity191 has said the whole country should accept fracking as it might potentially cut rising energy bills .			2
