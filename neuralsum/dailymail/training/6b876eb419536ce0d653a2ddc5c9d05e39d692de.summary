myth ? contemporary biographers have turned @entity2 into a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls @entity2 has been cast by many modern biographers as a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls that led him to take hundreds of nude photographs of them			1
but a leading authority on the author has now claimed this is a ‘ myth ’ created by spurious and sloppy research			0
@entity18 has criticised biographers who have given the author of two of literature ’s greatest children ’s classics - @entity25 and its sequel , through the @entity28 - a disturbing modern reputation			1
previously - unpublished letters and reminiscences of those who knew him are among thousands of documents which mr @entity18 has collected over four decades			1
they offer evidence that @entity2 was in fact a sociable man who enjoyed adult company as much as children ’s , he said , adding : ‘ it ’s both			1
you ca n’t just say it ’s one and not the other			0
’ from an opus of some 3,000 photographs , mr @entity18 has calculated that nude photographs of children represent ‘ no more than 1 per cent of @entity2 ’s output ’			1
while @entity49 wrote a novel portraying @entity2 as holding sexual feelings towards his muse , biographer @entity48 observed that it would be ‘ naïve ’ to suggest that @entity2 ’s interest in children was ‘ strictly artistic ’			1
but mr @entity18 points to unpublished material , including reminiscences of @entity58 , who was eight when she met @entity2 in 1877			1
she recalled : ‘ as a small child i much disliked strangers , but the personality of this gentleman attracted me and i chatted away with him quite freely			0
’ young girl : @entity65 ( pictured ) was photographed many times by @entity2			2
pictured above in 1858 , she was the daughter of family friend @entity67 and the inspiration for @entity25 on news of his death , she wrote of the ‘ irreparable loss in the hearts of many who had been his child - friends ’			0
mr @entity18 says : ‘ it is about time we cleared up , once and for all , the pervading false myth about [ @entity2 ’s ] unhealthy relationship with children			1
he was a lover of children but he was not an abuser of children			2
’ he added : ‘ there must be 30 or 40 biographies since his nephew wrote the first one in 1898			0
‘ people who decide to write about @entity2 realise that they ’re not going to get their book published unless they can find a new angle			2
‘ quite a few of them have scratched their head and come up with something outrageous and controversial like @entity2 was @entity94 , that he did n’t write @entity95 did - that he was having a sexual affair with @entity65 ’s mother , and a lot more nonsense … ‘ then there are biographers who really do n’t do their homework			2
they read a few other biographies , regurgitate them , add a few bits of speculation - and that ’s it			0
’ also pictured by @entity2 : @entity107 , photographed ( above ) in 1876 , was one of the author 's closest friends			1
the girl inspired his nonsense poem @entity111 then , he suggests , like @entity114 whispers , untrue facts get shared and embellished			0
he argues that , if biographers went back to the primary sources , they would discover a very different picture of @entity2 , the pseudonym of @entity2			2
as a writer of children ’s books , @entity2 ( above ) needed to explore children , a leading authority says mr @entity18 is a former chairman of the @entity125 , who regularly advises auctioneers and exhibitions worldwide			1
his books include @entity2 ’s ten - volume diaries , which he edited in 2007 following their release by the family			2
he also owns one of the finest @entity2 collections , including a database of 6,000 letters , of which some 4,000 are unpublished : ‘ so there ’s a great wealth of material i can draw on			2
’ he publishes his research later this month in a new book titled @entity2 : the man and his circle			1
numerous ‘ myths ’ that he challenges include those relating to @entity2 ’s photography , of which perhaps the most prevalent – ‘ frequently used by writers , biographers and journalists ’ – is the supposed large body of studies of nude children : ‘ this is not borne out by the facts			1
’ he argues that picturing nude children and focussing his camera on girls was common practice among @entity160 photographers and that , when @entity2 visited family friends , boys were more likely to be away at school			1
vilifying a man who believed in girls ’ education is therefore unjustified			0
anyway , there are as well many photographs of boys and adults			0
as a writer of children ’s books , @entity2 needed to explore children , mr @entity18 pointed out : ‘ his relationship with children is not an all - encompassing part of his life , which many of the biographers tried to suggest			1
‘ he was a teacher			0
he actually enjoyed the intellectual banter that he could have with children			2
children in @entity160 times found that very refreshing because it was very uncommon for someone to treat them as equals			0
children were seen and not heard			0
’ photographed : @entity2 also took portraits of poet @entity190 , @entity191 in 1857 ( left ) and @entity192 , the eighth child of @entity95 and @entity193 in 1875 ( right ) for @entity2 , mr @entity18 added , ‘ they were seen and heard ’			1
reviewing reminiscences by @entity2 ’s child - friends , mr @entity18 could not find ‘ a bad word spoken against him ’			1
those friends included @entity200 , who described @entity2 as ‘ one of my most delightful friends ’ with a ‘ sweet smile ’			2
she was seven when he read her the story of @entity206 ’s @entity205 : ‘ being very sensitive about my ugly little self , it greatly interested me			0
’ he told her that ‘ it was better to be good , truthful ’			0
mr @entity18 ridicules @entity2 ’s portrayal as an eccentric misfit : ‘ the vast majority of the biographers say he was a shy , reclusive man			1
‘ he mixed with the great and the good of @entity160 society - all the pre-raphaelites , @entity219 [ the composer ] , famous politicians			0
‘ he was a friend of the prime minister , @entity221 , whose parties he was often invited to			0
this man is not a recluse and he is n’t shy			0
’ his evidence includes an unpublished letter from @entity229 , telling @entity2 : ‘ the children are very anxious you should come to their party … and , if you could come on the 31st and stay over the 3rd january , we should be delighted to see you			1
’ his circle of friends included sir @entity234 , surgeon to @entity95 @entity235 and the @entity236			0
in response to @entity2 ’s concern for a friend who was dying from cancer , @entity234 wrote : ‘ i will gladly see the poor lady			2
’ ‘ everything 's got a moral , if only you can find it , ’ thought @entity2 , and in mr @entity18 ’s book it is clear : to defend him from his modern character assassins			1
the book is published ahead of next year ’s celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of @entity25 , and include a major @entity253 documentary , books and exhibitions worldwide			0
but no doubt those with suspicious minds will be back .			0
