by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 14:34 est , 25 september 2012 @entity2 schoolchildren preparing for the invasion of the @entity4 during the @entity5 were given a textbook portraying @entity7 as a man of peace and the @entity4 as evil warmongers			1
the bizarre 1942 publication - which was written in english - attempts to give children an idea of what to expect when visiting the @entity16 in the event of a successful @entity19 take - over			1
in it , a variety of bold claims are made , accusing @entity23 of running the @entity4 press and statements about @entity27 people secretly supporting @entity28 , but it does reflect @entity7 's admiration for the work of @entity31			1
taking the peace : designed to prepare schoolchildren for life in @entity4 under @entity2 occupation , the text book makes a series of bizarre claims embellished : the textbook grossly exaggerates the gulf between the rich and the poor , complete with his cartoon which supposedly depicts how the @entity4 upper classes treat the impoverished how the other half live : this image , left , is designed to give an ' insight ' into how the lower classes were housed in slums , while another chapter , right , focuses on the ' decline ' of agriculture sentiments of anti-semitism : predictably , the guide book also includes a section on how the @entity23 are supposedly regarded in @entity27 laughably , @entity7 is portrayed as a ' great peacemaker ' while @entity27 ‘ atrocities ’ against @entity60 and @entity61 are described in gory detail - with no mention at all of @entity19 death camps			1
and the gulf between the upper and working classes is greatly exaggerated , with whole chapters dedicated to the @entity68 slums of @entity69			0
to emphasise their claims , the text is accompanied by strange illustrations , including a cartoon of an aristocrat trampling over poor people			2
sections have titles like ‘ a @entity79 ’ , ‘ @entity80 of the @entity81 ’ and ‘ @entity27 and the @entity23 ’			1
' great peacemaker ' : the book portrays @entity7 ( left ) in a favourable light			0
it also reflects @entity87 's admiration for the work of the @entity89 , @entity31 ( right ) however , the textbook also celebrates various aspects of @entity4 culture , including the countryside and the works of @entity31			2
a picture of the @entity89 ’s birthplace , @entity97 , @entity98 , is even splashed across the front cover			0
@entity7 , a notorious fan of the playwright , even dedicated a section of the text to his role as a @entity4 cultural icon			2
the book , which was designed to be distributed among @entity2 teens ahead of a planned invasion , celebrates @entity7 as a man of peace			2
one section reads : ' he [ @entity7 ] made before the @entity2 people and the world several offers of peace , in words which were unequivocal , emotional and idealistic			1
' he was called a liar in the world press			0
he offered @entity119 friendship saying that there was no further cause of quarrel between their two peoples			0
' the @entity119 press spat on his outstretched hand and increased their military strength			0
' the 1942 book was entitled ‘ @entity134 fur die @entity135 an @entity136 ’ [ ‘ @entity137 ’ ] , and was written at the height of @entity19 expansion across @entity132			0
it has been put up for sale by a private collector and is expected to fetch £ 250 when it is sold at auction on thursday			0
cultural tips : a guide on the country 's @entity146 theatres was also included in the book getting familiar with the @entity89 : a chapter on @entity31 and his significance in literature is also touched upon economical with the truth : @entity27 ' atrocities ' against @entity60 and @entity61 are described in gory detail - with no mention of @entity19 death camps @entity157 , of @entity159 ’s auctioneers in @entity160 , @entity161 , said the textbook gave a ' comic - book ' interpretation of 1940s @entity4 life			1
he said : ' this is a chilling reminder of what the @entity167 had in store for us had they successfully invaded in 1940			0
' they were clearly preparing their students and their troops for occupation of the @entity4 - training them in the culture and history of our country so that they knew what to expect when they took over			2
' it is particularly frightening to see the chapters on our @entity23 heritage and our relationships with the @entity23 in the @entity4			1

publication ' educated ' @entity2 schoolchildren on @entity27 culture in the event of a @entity19 invasion
it made claims like the @entity4 press was run by @entity23 and that most @entity27 people were secretly @entity195
@entity27 ' atrocities ' against @entity60 and @entity61 are described in detail while no mention is made of @entity19 death camps
