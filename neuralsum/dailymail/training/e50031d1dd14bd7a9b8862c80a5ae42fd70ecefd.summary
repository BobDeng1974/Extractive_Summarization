a mixture of beef and horse offcuts found in contaminated burgers sold in supermarkets could have been used for a year , the @entity0 has said today			1
the contaminated meat was in the form of blocks of frozen product from a @entity12 supplier which had been used for a year , @entity0 chief executive @entity6 told the @entity13			1
investigations are going on into how long contaminated meat might have been in use , ms @entity6 told @entity18			1
' the probable limit of possibility ... is a year because it 's been a year that this supplier has been supplying			2
' and therefore when the @entity12 get to the bottom of this we will hope to know whether it 's likely that this has been going on for a year			1
' meat in @entity22 burgers which was found to contain horse dna did not come from a list of approved suppliers , the supermarket also admitted today			1
the meat also came from outside the @entity29 or @entity45 , which was contrary to the supermarket 's policy			1
the supermarket has now dropped its frozen burger supplier , @entity67 , following what it termed a ' breach of trust '			1
it has vowed to introduce a dna testing system on meat products to ' ensure the quality ' of the food on its shelves in the wake of the scandal that has disgusted customers			1
it said : ' we now understand - with as much certainty as possible - what happened			0
' the evidence tells us that our frozen burger supplier , @entity67 , used meat in our products that did not come from the list of approved suppliers we gave them			1
' nor was the meat from the @entity29 or @entity45 , despite our instruction that only beef from the @entity29 and @entity45 should be used in our frozen beefburgers			2
' consequently we have decided not to take products from that supplier in future			2
we took that decision with regret but the breach of trust is simply too great			2
' @entity22 was forced to issue a public apology earlier this month after tests in @entity45 discovered traces of horse meat in three frozen beefburger lines			1
the findings sparked a national outcry and 10 million burgers were pulled from shelves as a result of the scandal			0
the supermarket launched an investigation into how the meat ended up in stores in the @entity29 and @entity45 on january 16			2
dropped : @entity22 says it has dropped supplier @entity114 after the ' breach of trust ' today it promised to set a ' new standard ' with the introduction of a testing system designed to detect ' any deviation from our high standards '			1
it issued a statement saying : ' we made a commitment to customers to investigate thoroughly and share the findings with them			0
since then , we have been working hard to understand what happened and how we can stop it ever happening again			0
' it added : ' ultimately @entity22 is responsible for the food we sell , so it is not enough just to stop using the supplier			1
' we have a well - equipped , expert technical team and world - class checks in place but we will not take anything for granted after this incident			0
' it has shown that , in spite of our stringent tests , checks and controls there remained a small possibility that something could go wrong and it did			0
we want to stop it ever happening again , so we are taking action to reduce that possibility still further			0
' to underpin the strong measures already in place , we will now introduce a comprehensive system of dna testing across our meat products			1
this will identify any deviation from our high standards			0
' these checks will set a new standard			0
' it will be a significant investment for @entity22 , borne by @entity22			2
we want to leave customers in no doubt that we will do whatever it takes to ensure the quality of their food and that the food they buy is exactly what the label says it is			1
' @entity171 beefburgers were removed after it was discovered they contained horse meat the controversy surrounding @entity22 extended to @entity176 , @entity67 , @entity177 and @entity178 after some of their products were also found to contain low levels of horse dna			1
the furore deepened further last week when it emerged a potentially carcinogenic drug may have entered the food chain following the slaughter of horses in the @entity29			0
shadow environment secretary @entity189 told the @entity13 that some of these animals tested positive for the carcinogen phenylbutazone , commonly known as bute			0
she said : ' i am in receipt of evidence showing that several horses slaughtered in @entity29 abattoirs last year tested positive for phenylbutazone , or bute , a drug which causes cancer in humans and is banned from the human food chain			0
' it is possible that those animals entered the human food chain			0
' the @entity13 is due to take evidence on the contamination of beef products with horse meat later today			2
food which tested positive was found to have been produced by @entity213 and @entity114 in @entity45 and the @entity29 plant , @entity215			0
a statement released earlier this week by @entity217 , which owns @entity67 , issued an apology and said they had appointed a new management team at the supplier and they will also introduce new dna tests			1
@entity223 , group chief executive , @entity217 said : ' this has been a very difficult experience for all involved and has led to a significant interruption in business for @entity67 and its customers			0
we are relieved that the source of the problem has been identified			0
' ' while the company has never knowingly purchased or traded in equine product , i wish to take this opportunity to apologise for the impact this issue has caused			0
' ' as previously stated the company has never knowingly bought or processed horse meat and all of our purchases are from approved and licensed @entity245 plants			0
' @entity22 has won praise from the government and @entity18 after announcing it would step up its food tracing procedures in the wake of the discovery of horse meat in beef burgers			1
environment minister @entity253 said he ' welcomed ' the supermarket 's announcement , which also won praise from shadow minister @entity257			2
mr @entity257 also welcomed the move towards dna testing , which @entity260 has called on the government to instigate			1
he told @entity18 : ' it is a welcome innovation , it is what we should be seeing more of , it 's what the @entity265 and others are calling for more of and it shows the extent to which we now need to be far more rigorous than we used to			1
' it 's not the same world it was 20 years ago			0
' mr @entity257 said increased globalisation in meat supply had reinforced the need for more stringent checks on meat products			1
and he pressed the minister to also update mps on how horse meat was checked for medical contamination , after evidence emerged horse meat may have entered the food chain after testing positive for phenylbutazone , or bute			2
but mr @entity253 said sampling and results for bute can take up to three weeks - meaning it 's ' entirely possible ' that in that time the meat could be taken abroad and consumed			2
he did say the @entity0 are investigating the bute claims and will take action if necessary .			0
