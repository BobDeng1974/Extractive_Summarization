by @entity0 did you have breakfast today ? if not , you 're putting yourself in grave danger - at least , that 's according to a slew of recent reports which link skipping breakfast to obesity , diabetes and even catching flu			1
in the latest study , @entity12 researchers found men who do n't have breakfast are 27 per cent more likely to suffer heart attacks or heart disease			1
the team at the @entity19 said missing the meal put an ' extra strain ' on the body			2
so is a morning meal really so crucial to health - and what 's the healthiest thing to have ? breakfast blues : men who do n't eat the meal are 27 % more likely to suffer heart attacks or heart disease there is nothing magical about breakfast that makes it particularly important for health , says dr @entity36 , head of diet and population health at the @entity39			1
' i suspect you 'd get the same risks - such as weight gain - with skipping lunch or dinner , but it 's a less common behaviour , so people do n't study it			1
' the pro-breakfast brigade would dispute this , pointing out that metabolic rate - the rate at which we burn calories - drops during sleep , and eating breakfast ' kick - starts ' it again			1
yet the evidence for this is not convincing , says @entity61 , professor of metabolic medicine at @entity63			0
' in trials like this recent one on heart disease , you have to ask - does skipping breakfast put you at risk of heart attack , or are people who skip breakfast simply more likely to have unhealthy characteristics and be disorganised and mindless about eating ? ' blame your genes : if you struggle to eat in the hours after waking , it may have to do with your biological clock if you struggle to eat in the hours after waking , it could be down to your biological clock , which is determined in part by your genes			1
around 10 per cent of the population inherit genes that mean their clock is set a little slower , so they struggle to wake up in the morning , and this can affect appetite , says sleep expert dr @entity86			2
' when we wake , a number of processes begin to get the body ready for daytime , including the release of hormones that make us feel hungry			0
' but if you 're an “ owl ” - who likes to stay up late but finds it hard to get up in the morning - you wo n't wake up feeling hungry , and the idea of breakfast will be difficult			1
' so do n't force yourself to eat when you wake up at 7am			1
you 'll probably find you start feeling hungry around 9am or 10am when you get to the office , so you could have something then			2
' however , dr @entity86 says irregular bedtimes can also cause your clock to be out of sync , so try going to bed at the same time each night and you might start feeling hungry in the mornings			0
some experts question the importance attached to eating breakfast above all other meals , but a number of studies have shown that doing so protects against obesity			1
this may not be because it 's breakfast as such , but because it 's one of three important daily meals			2
' if you do n't eat breakfast you 'll be starving by mid-morning so you 'll snack - then you wo n't eat a proper lunch and you 'll be hungry again mid-afternoon and need to snack , and so on , ' explains @entity121 , professor of health psychology at the @entity122			1
skipping breakfast can also influence the food choices we make throughout the day			2
last year , a team at @entity127 presented the results of a study involving 21 men and women , all around the age of 25 , who skipped breakfast one day but then had it the next			1
on the day they skipped breakfast , not only did they eat 20 per cent more at lunch , but they were more likely to seek unhealthier , high - calorie foods			1
the researchers scanned volunteers ' brains while showing them pictures of food and found activity in the orbitofrontal cortex - which is linked to feelings of reward - was especially responsive to foods such as pizza and chocolate			0
dr @entity153 , who led the research , said humans were primed to seek sugary , fatty foods after a period of fasting			0
however , while people who skip breakfast are statistically more likely to be overweight , eating it wo n't necessarily help you shed pounds			1
in a recent study at the @entity164 , a group of teenage girls who usually skipped breakfast were observed as they started eating breakfast over three weeks			1
although they felt less hungry through the day and had lower levels of hormones such as ghrelin , which stimulates appetite , the girls ate more calories overall when they ate breakfast			2
overweight : people who skip breakfast are more likely to pile on the pounds ever tuck into a hearty full @entity177 in the morning , believing you 'll eat less for lunch ? stop fooling yourself			1
a 2011 study published in @entity180 found people eat the same at lunch and dinner , regardless of what they have for breakfast			1
dr @entity36 and her team at the @entity39 recently gave 33 overweight men and women breakfast three times - one contained around 700 calories , another was 20 per cent smaller and the third was almost half the size , at 300 calories			1
they found that the volunteers ate the same amount post breakfast each time			2
in other words , if you 're trying to lose weight , a small 300 calorie breakfast should be enough to stop you overeating later			2
examples of breakfasts that come in under 300 calories include a bowl of porridge with honey , a bowl of @entity208 cereal with milk , and a boiled egg with a slice of wholemeal toast			0
dietitian @entity213 , who eats toast with spreadable butter and coffee for breakfast , offers a warning about seemingly - innocuous muesli			2
' be mindful of your portion , ' she says			0
' as mueslis and granola take up less room in the bowl than flakes , it would be easy to pour yourself 50g - which is actually a lot of calories			0
' the worst ways to start the day include sugary cereals , pastries and white bread - which will cause a spike in blood sugar levels			0
if you have breakfast but nevertheless find your belly is rumbling again by 11am - and you 're overweight - it could be a sign of insulin resistance , a precursor to diabetes , says @entity213			0
insulin converts sugar to energy in the body , but if your body has become resistant to the hormone , the insulin does n't work as effectively , so the body has to produce even more			0
' this means once the sugar from your breakfast has been metabolised there 'll be a bit of insulin left hanging around , which keeps lowering your blood sugar , so you feel hungry again , ' she says			1
' if you 're experiencing this and other symptoms of insulin resistance such as weight gain , especially around the middle , and feeling tired , see your doctor and make an effort to lose some weight , as this can stop it developing into full - blown diabetes			0
' learn to love it : if you eat @entity268 for a while and expose your tastebuds to it , you 'll start to enjoy it perhaps you 'd love to start the day more healthily , but the idea of a bowl of @entity268 makes you want to stay under the duvet			2
@entity274 , director of @entity275 , has some advice : ' tastebuds are malleable little fellows			0
' if you soak them in sugary and salty foods , they 'll lose their sensitivity to it and you 'll start to need more all the time			0
conversely , if you change your food choices , little by little you 'll rehabilitate them and within weeks you 'll start to love foods that love you back			0
' professor @entity61 backs him up			0
' i used to love @entity289 , until i discovered both my parents had diabetes and i had to change my diet			0
if you eat @entity268 for a while , and expose your tastebuds to it , you 'll start to enjoy it			2
' the idea of many fasting diets such as the 5:2 plan - where you dramatically cut your calories for two days each week - is to find a routine that suits you			0
dr @entity300 , author of @entity301 , says skipping breakfast is fine if that 's what works for you			0
' some people on the diet do like to skip breakfast but i prefer to skip lunch so that i can eat in the mornings and evenings with my family			1
' a new fasting plan actually encourages you to skip breakfast			0
the @entity314 , devised by @entity315 , a @entity12 physician , suggests fasting all morning and exercising before eating your first meal of the day at noon			1
you then eat sensibly for the rest of the day			0
the theory is because you only have to fast for a morning , and not a full day as you do on diets such as the 5:2 , you 'll find it easier to eat sensibly			1
@entity315 claims that in a trial of his diet , volunteers lost an average nine pounds after 12 weeks .			0

men who do n't eat breakfast are 27 % more likely to suffer heart attacks
eating a meal in the morning may protect against obesity
but having a full @entity177 does n't mean you 'll eat less at lunch
