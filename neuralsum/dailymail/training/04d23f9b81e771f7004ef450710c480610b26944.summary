@entity0 was back on the practice court on tuesday , intent on making sure there will be no repeat of the mysterious attack of cramping that nearly put him out of the @entity6 almost before it had begun			1
his next opponent is lowly @entity10 qualifier @entity9 , but as @entity0 drily noted of his physical meltdown in the first round versus @entity13 : ‘ if he watched , i am sure he will be feeling pretty good about the match			1
’ @entity0 is supremely fit , a diligent trainer with a highly professional support team and has been in the @entity18 summer since early july , so there had to be other reasons for his distress against the @entity22			1
firstly , the women ’s match beforehand took only 47 minutes so the players were on court very abruptly , which could have affected his fluid and carb intake beforehand			0
@entity43 laid plans : the @entity45 has been in the @entity46 since early july acclimatising for the @entity47 also , the 27 - year - old @entity45 took the friday before the tournament off and spent his time following @entity50 at the golf in @entity52 , before heading to watch basketball in the evening at @entity54			1
@entity55 , a master of sports physiology who is head of performance at @entity58 , pointed out that hydration can catch out even well - prepared athletes			1
‘ it can be relevant what you have done in the previous two or three days , ’ said leather			0
‘ just having clear urine does not mean you are properly hydrated			0
people might underestimate what a finely tuned athlete someone like @entity0 is and that fractional changes can make a bigger difference than expected			1
air conditioning , like in an indoor stadium , can add to dehydration			0
’ the other most likely cause of cramping is tension although , after coming through in four sets , @entity0 said : ‘ i did n’t feel particularly nervous			1
i ’ve been a lot more nervous before @entity47 finals			0
’ as @entity55 pointed out , however , the mind can work in ways beyond scientific understanding : ‘ the power of the brain on the body is a grey area			2
and you could understand @entity0 being quite tense at some level			2
hardly imposing : @entity0 admits his next opponent , @entity10 qualifier @entity9 , ' will be feeling pretty good about the match ’ after seeing him struggle to victory over @entity94 in his first outing in @entity27 to the best of ' em : sports physiologist @entity55 says hydration can catch out even well - prepared athletes ‘ there is pressure on him , he has dropped down the rankings , there are a few questions			1
however tough you are , nobody is immune to those feelings			0
’ there is no doubt the @entity13 encounter was an awkward start to what is already a difficult tournament for @entity0			2
it was played on his least favourite court at a @entity47 , one where he has seen plenty of problems before - including against the same opponent			0
it was also his first match at a major since his uncharacteristic slump against @entity120 at @entity121			0
the wider issue is that he has come to @entity27 still searching for a significant win over a top - 10 player this year			2
that is sure to gnaw away at his belief until it is rectified , as it surely will be in time			0
unexplained : @entity0 says he did n't feel nervous but there 's a chance tension could have been a factor for him the fact @entity133 , his @entity47 nemesis , is not here may also be adding to the pressure he places on himself			1
well before the cramping began , @entity0 was not playing with much fluency against @entity13 and he put in five double faults before the first set was done			1
his ball toss — believed to be the cause of his much discussed outburst during the @entity144 match at @entity121 — appears to be an issue at the moment			0
it is much to @entity0 ’s credit he still won			2
@entity150 competitors would have succumbed , but he still has a shot at getting to the stage where he can claim the kind of major scalp that should turn his season around			0
it was confirmed that @entity0 , who appeared to be moving freely on the practice court , will play on thursday giving him three days to ensure the cramping does not re-occur			1
it 's not too late to play @entity161 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager @entity164 : day two review			0

@entity0 suffered cramping during his first round @entity6 win
the @entity45 struggled physically in his win over @entity22 @entity94
he next faces @entity10 qualifier @entity9 on thursday
@entity0 and his support team have been in the @entity18 since early july
sports physiologist @entity55 said hydration and tension could have been a factor for the super fit athlete
