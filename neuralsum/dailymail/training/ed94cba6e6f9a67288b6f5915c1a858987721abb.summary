by @entity0 published : 02:25 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 27 august 2013 cigarettes could be banned from being sold in packets of 10 in an @entity4 bid to prevent children from starting to smoke			1
the planned curbs , which would also hit menthol and ' slim ' cigarettes , could outlaw the sale of more than half of all tobacco currently sold in @entity13			1
tobacco giants have lashed out against the proposed legislation , claiming that it will deprive the @entity16 of revenue as smokers turn to the black market			1
curbs : 10 - packs and menthol cigarettes could be outlawed by new legislation being considered by the @entity4 the latest development in the @entity4 's long - running battle against smoking is set to come in a @entity28 vote on september 10			1
@entity29 will vote on whether to outlaw the sales of 10 - packs , flavoured and slim cigarettes , as well as smaller packets of loose - leaf tobacco			1
if they approve the new rules , they could come into effect as early as 2016			0
currently 38 per cent of all cigarettes are sold in packs of 10 , but there are concerns that the cheaper packets make it more likely that young people will start smoking			1
crackdown : the government has jettisoned plans to introduce plain packaging with graphic photographs mothers and grandmothers are concerned that bright , colourful packaging makes tobacco appealing to children , according to a new poll			1
the survey by @entity56 found that four out of five women believe bright packaging is attractive to young people , with 85 per cent saying that children should not be exposed to tobacco marketing			1
campaigners are using the results to push the government to introduce plain packaging for all cigarettes , a plan which was put on hold last month			2
under the plans , tobacco packs would all be the same colour and would carry a prominent , graphic warning about the dangers of smoking			1
today 's survey of mothers and grandmothers of children under 18 found 92 per cent would be worried about their children if they became addicted to smoking			0
over 200,000 children take up smoking every year , with more girls smoking regularly than boys , figures show			0
@entity86 , @entity56 's head of tobacco control , said : ' we 're urging the government to introduce plain , standardised packaging of tobacco , which , as well as being a popular move , would show that the government cares more about the health of future generations than the profits of the tobacco industry			2
' we 'd like to see the government protect children from the lure of sophisticated tobacco industry marketing and introduce plain , standardised packaging as a way to reduce the number of young people who take up smoking			2
' @entity108 has accused the @entity109 of ' caving in to big business ' by delaying the introduction of plain packaging , but health minister @entity113 said she ' would never give in to pressure '			0
menthol and slim cigarettes are also thought to be more attractive to young people by disguising the taste of smoking			2
another proposal would mean that loose tobacco for roll - up cigarettes and pipes could only be sold in packs of 40g or more			1
currently , more than 90 per cent of loose tobacco comes in packs of 25g or 12.5g			1
the @entity4 is anxious to reduce the number of deaths caused by smoking , which currently stands at 700,000 per year across the continent			0
however , large tobacco companies have warned that the legislation could have unintended consequences , costing the @entity16 as much as Â£ 800million in lost revenue			2
@entity134 , maker of @entity135 and @entity136 , suggested that the @entity13 was ' sleepwalking ' towards an unacceptably harsh crackdown			0
@entity138 , the firm 's head of corporate affairs , said that the legislation was ' even more severe ' than plans to impose plain packaging which were delayed last month			0
@entity145 leader @entity144 , one of @entity13 's most high - profile smokers , told the @entity147 : ' this is part of a wrong - headed drive that will penalise the legal pleasures of the least well - off			0
' the net result will be an increase in sub-standard counterfeit and smuggled tobacco , which will have obvious negative health outcomes			0
let alone a deliberate reduction in personal freedom - that is a matter of course from @entity160			0
' @entity161 of @entity162 added : ' there 's an enormous risk			0
' just take menthol - if almost a million smokers wake up one morning and they can no longer buy their preferred product in the shop , there 's a massive opportunity there created for criminals and illegal traders to step in and meet the demand that the legal market can no longer supply			0
