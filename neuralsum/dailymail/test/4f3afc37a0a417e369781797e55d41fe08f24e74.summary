a vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer a vaccine has been developed to help prevent the recurrence of prostate cancer , and potentially other cancers			1
it 's designed to teach the immune system to recognise compounds found in prostate cancer cells and is being given to men who have already been treated for the cancer			1
the vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called @entity16 that 's found in about 95 per cent of prostate cancers			1
animal studies have shown that the protein can effectively stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer			1
the thinking is that the vaccine will prime the immune system so that it creates antibodies when it detects @entity16 - related cancers			1
then , should the cancer reappear , the antibodies will be dispatched to attack the malignant cells			1
those antibodies , along with other immune cells , can then destroy cancer cells without harming non-cancer cells , so minimising side - effects			1
it is initially being tested as a way to treat cancer that has returned but , if successful , could be used as a first line treatment for prostate and potentially breast cancer in the future			1
@entity16 is also found in about 50 per cent of breast cancers			1
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the @entity42 , with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year			1
in many cases the cancer develops slowly and patients may simply be monitored rather than actively treated			2
but in cases where the cancer is more aggressive , even after treatment there is a high risk of recurrence			2
researchers at the @entity53 are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer , but whose @entity56 is rising again ( posed by model ) once they have been treated , men are monitored with regular blood tests that check for a protein called prostate specific antigen or @entity56 , which can indicate cancer			1
the time it takes for the @entity56 reading to double is called the @entity66			2
men with a @entity66 of less than three months are at high risk of dying from prostate cancer			2
around 11,000 men in the @entity42 die from the disease a year			0
researchers at the @entity53 are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer , but whose @entity56 is rising again			2
men on the trial will have a @entity66 greater than three months and less than 15			0
the trial will last nearly two years , and men will be given six injections of the vaccine or a placebo during that time			0
the number of men in @entity42 with , or who have had , prostate cancer professor @entity85 , urology consultant at the @entity86 , says that the idea of boosting the body 's own immune defences is an ' excellent strategy ' for preventing a recurrence of the disease			1
' toxicity studies will have to be done , and then clinical effectiveness studies are needed , and it will need to be compared to existing treatments , ' he says			0
' but despite these time constraints , the research looks very promising indeed and we must watch this space			0
' meanwhile , the @entity102 vaccine may be a new way to tackle problem warts			0
researchers have found that injecting the vaccine into warts that have resisted other treatments leads to six out of ten disappearing			2
warts are caused by infection with the human papilloma virus ( @entity113 )			0
although they can clear up without treatment within one to two years , about a third or more do not resolve and may multiply and enlarge , making treatment more difficult			0
in the new study , researchers used the jab on 65 patients who 'd had warts for between two and 15 years			0
they had an average of three treatments			0
in 63 per cent of cases , the warts disappeared , while 6 per cent showed no response			0
the remainder had some improvement			0
side - effects included pain during injection , itching and flu - like symptoms			0
the warts recurred in only two patients , according to the researchers from @entity136 , @entity137 , whose findings are published in the @entity139			0
the theory is that the vaccine stimulates the immune system , which then spots and attacks the hpv virus and the warts it had previously overlooked .			1

vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called @entity16
@entity16 is found in about 95 per cent of prostate cancers
studies show the protein can teach the immune system to attack cancer
