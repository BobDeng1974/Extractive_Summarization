by @entity0 beauty pageants have become just as discussed for their anti-feminist message as for the attributes of the contestants			2
despite many feeling the bikini portion of the competition is demeaning to women , the contestants in this year 's @entity9 beauty pageant seemed happy to show off their bodies as they posed for the swimwear round , which makes up one part of the contest , the winner of which will go onto the @entity18 pageant			1
they are are all hoping to follow in the footsteps of the reigning @entity9 , @entity20 , 24 , who joined them in @entity22 , @entity23 , for a photoshoot on the deck of a luxury yacht			1
another of the girls , miss @entity54 , @entity56 , 22 was bullied at school because of a lazy eye - but turned the tables on her tormentors by getting straight as in her a-levels and going to medical school			2
constants this year include medical students as well as psychology students , dancers and trainee accountants the women seemed to be enjoying the photo shoot , despite the rather unpredictable @entity72 summertime weather the young models lapped up the sun on the deck of a yacht before heading to nearby @entity77 for more photos they are among 60 finalists who have been picked from heats across the country and a final winner will be crowned in june			1
the annual beauty contest is staged in @entity22 where last year local mp @entity84 said it was an ' own goal ' for women			2
founder of the @entity9 competition @entity89 argues that despite appearances : ' it 's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty ' miss @entity93 , @entity95 and miss @entity96 , @entity98 ( left ) and miss @entity99 , @entity101 and miss @entity102 , @entity104 , splash around in the waves ( right ) his comments were dismissed by a previous winner @entity108 , from @entity109 , @entity54 , who said this was precisely the sort of stereotyped view the girls were hoping to challenge			1
and the woman behind the @entity9 contest has come to its defence			2
director @entity89 said accusations that the contest was inappropriate nowadays were old - fashioned			0
the swimwear round of the competition was launched on monday at @entity36 amid reports there was unease that it was getting a Â£ 7000 subsidy from @entity125 to stage the show			1
but @entity89 said the view that beauty pageants were degrading was outdated			0
the contestants have their own @entity131 moment as they run out of the no doubt rather chilly @entity96 sea onto the beach she said : ' we 've come a long way from girls just turning up with their heels and swimsuit and walking on a catwalk to be judged			2
' now girls take part in various rounds including a tough sports round - you have to be physically fit			2
' the current miss @entity9 ran the @entity147 this year and raised thousands of pounds for childrens ' charities			1
' miss @entity9 is about being a good role model			1
' there 's a talent round where the girls submit their talent - what they think they 're good at			0
' they have to be good at something - it could be their jobs or something they enjoy doing			0
' there 's an eco-fashion round where the girls have to create an outfit using recycled materials - they have to be creative			0
as well as the swimwear round , the competition now includes a sports round and an @entity170 round miss @entity171 , miss @entity173 @entity172 and miss @entity174 enjoy frolicking for the camera despite many feeling the bikini portion of the competition is demeaning to women , the 14 contestants showed off their bodies with seeming joy ' it 's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty			1
' modelling competitions are about just looks alone			0
' miss @entity9 is about being a good all rounder and a good role model			1
this year alone we had 20,000 girls apply to enter the competition			0
' when people stop applying to be a role model we 'll stop holding the competition			0
' current miss @entity9 @entity194 also said she felt the pageant was positive			1
' i feel it empowers women to do good things for their country , their communities and be good role models			0
