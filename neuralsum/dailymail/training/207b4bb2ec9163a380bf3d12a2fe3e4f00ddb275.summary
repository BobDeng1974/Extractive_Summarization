the traditional @entity1 owners of @entity2 , the remote @entity3 outback land on which @entity4 detonated seven atomic bombs 50 years ago , will finally be allowed back on the nuclear testing site			1
the @entity3 government has officially returned the 1,782 square kilometre site to the @entity11 people , granting them full access to the land known until this week as the ' @entity14 ' or the @entity15			2
the owners are now planning to turn the land , which is 500km north - west of @entity18 , into a tourism mecca			0
traditional owners : @entity11 people gather in the @entity3 outback town @entity23 to have the final parcel of their homeland returned to them , 58 years after @entity4 took over the land to drop atomic bombs and test nuclear warheads in the remote western desert region mushroom cloud : the atomic cloud over @entity2 ( pictured , left ) after @entity4 dropped one of its nuclear test bombs between 1956 and 1963 , causing widespread radiation sickness among the local @entity1 people and contaminating the environment			1

the map shows a vast tract of @entity3 's western desert which was used by @entity4 in the 1950s to drop atomic bombs and establish its nuclear power status in the @entity60 poisoned ground : nuclear testing programme worker @entity62 photographed in the 1950s on the ground in the @entity3 town of @entity2 wearing protective clothing and carrying a camera in a plastic cover			2
mr @entity62 appears to be standing by the perimeter of a radioactive area at the atomic bomb testing site fifty years on : a local @entity74 boy walks alongside a policewoman at @entity2 this week , as @entity3 government officials flew in to the tiny @entity3 town to hand back the title to the traditional owners of a parcel of land known as ' @entity14 ' - the nuclear testing range where @entity4 launched atomic bombs in the 1950s the area is part of the 3,300 square kilometres of territory belonging to the @entity89 indigenous language group which @entity4 appropriated to conduct nuclear tests between 1956 and 1963			1
@entity3 and @entity4 servicemen built the test site and an airstrip on @entity14 in 1956 in a region known colloquially as the @entity15 , which had been established as a restricted access area after the end of the @entity97			0
@entity4 's defence authorities decided to test nuclear bombs at @entity2 , as well as at another @entity3 region called @entity101 and the @entity102 off @entity103 , to establish its nuclear power status during the @entity60			2
radioactive fallout : the @entity89 people , from the @entity2 - @entity11 community , gather this week for the formal handover of ' @entity14 ' , an outstanding 1782 sq km portion of their land which was finally returned to them			1
more than 50 years ago , @entity4 used the land for nuclear testing , which caused skin rashes , diarrhoea , fevers and , later , blood diseases and cancer among @entity119 exposed to the radiation @entity121 from nowhere : the vast region of @entity3 's far western desert known as @entity2 was chosen for its remoteness by the @entity3 government for @entity4 's @entity60 nuclear tests			1
many indigenous people as well as @entity3 and @entity4 servicemen suffered the debilitating effects of radiation poisoning following the dropping of atomic bombs in the outback big day : a local @entity1 boy climbs aboard the @entity135 on the airstrip at @entity2 after defence force personnel flew in to attend the ceremony to hand back the piece of traditional land once used as a nuclear testing range by the @entity4 government thanks a lot mate : two members of the local indigenous community at @entity2 speak with @entity3 defence minister , @entity146 , at the ceremony held this week to hand back the country taken from the @entity119 , bombed by the @entity4 and poisoned with radioactive fallout			1
@entity3 spent $ 100m rehabilitating the land hundreds of nuclear trials were carried out			0
@entity4 dropped twelve nuclear bombs at @entity2 , and then went on to test nuclear warheads			0
although many @entity1 people were forcibly removed from their land , more than a thousand were directly affected			0
the widespread radioactive fallout of the bombs across the environment , which the local @entity1 people called ' puyu ' or ' black mist ' , caused disease and death			2
new dawn : synonymous with the atomic bombs that were exploded secretly in its backyard , @entity2 is now hoping to capitalise on its name as a nuclear testing site and attract tourists then : @entity2 village in 1956 as seen from an aircraft flying over the north - east of the tiny outback town now : the @entity175 @entity135 casts a shadow over @entity14 as it flies in for the formal handing over of the land back to the the traditional @entity1 owners , the @entity2 - @entity11 community bombs away : servicemen photographed celebrating at @entity2 in 1955 , a year before the airstrip and nuclear testing site was built			1
following extensive nuclear testing at @entity2 , both @entity3 and @entity4 military men stationed in the area suffered radiation poisoning @entity89 people , along with the non-indigenous civilians and @entity3 and @entity4 soldiers exposed to the radiation , suffered from radioactive poisoning , with symptoms including vomiting , skin rashes , diarrhoea , fevers and , later , blood diseases and cancer			1
a 1985 royal commission into the @entity4 nuclear testing in @entity3 found the fallout from exploding radioactive @entity203 and elements such as @entity205 in the desert was three times greater than predicted , and that the tests left ' off the scale ' @entity211 counter readings 25 years later			2
the local @entity119 , because of ' their unique lifestyle , and often their lack of clothing , footwear and permanent shelter ' were particularly vulnerable to radiation ; one group became sick after walking across highly radioactive ground in bare feet			0
boom town : @entity2 village caretaker , @entity223 , outside his home in the town that he and other residents are hoping becomes a tourism mecca by trading in on its ' nuclear ' name @entity231 : inside one of the old barracks at @entity2 , where @entity3 and @entity4 servicemen slept during the seven years that atomic bombs and nuclear warheads were tested in the @entity3 desert final handover : attending the official ceremony to hand over the final piece of homeland to its traditional owners are ( left to right ) , defence minister , @entity49 , @entity245 minister , @entity51 , and @entity246 , @entity243 belly of the beast : south @entity3 senator @entity243 speaks with a crew member in the @entity175 @entity135 on the way to @entity2 in @entity3 for the hand - over ceremony of @entity1 land some land title was returned to its @entity1 owners following the royal commission			1
the @entity3 government spent $ 100 million cleaning up the land between 1993 and 2001			1
in 2004 , special legislation was passed handing back the title over 21,000 square kilometres to the @entity11 and @entity261 people			0
the @entity262 held on to @entity14 as a weapons testing range until this week			0
sign of the time : the road sign to @entity14 , the former nuclear testing site , says ' low level ' radioactive contamination still exists the final piece of homeland land was returned to the @entity39 at a ceremony in @entity2 village attended by hundreds of traditional owners , and the defence minister @entity49 and @entity175 chief , @entity277 @entity275 , at the ceremony , @entity11 general manager , @entity278 , said his community planned to set up a business to take visitors on bus tours of the traditional area and nuclear test sites			1
he said there was strong interest from four - wheel - drive clubs , ' grey nomads ' and former servicemen who were based in @entity2			0
tours would begin in april next year			0
@entity293 , @entity51 , told @entity294 the tourism venture would allow the government to work with the traditional owners to ensure the land could be used as a foundation for economic advancement			0
the defence minister , senator @entity49 , said he hoped the handover will provide some ' solace ' to the @entity2 people , in particular those who were removed from their traditional lands and relocated to missions .			0

the land traditionally belonged to the @entity2 - @entity11 community
@entity4 's nuclear tests in @entity3 caused widespread radiation poisoning
aborigines and @entity3 and @entity4 soldiers suffered disease and death
radioactive fallout in remote @entity3 was three time greater than predicted
@entity3 spent $ 100 million cleaning up the traditional lands
the government held on to the 1782sq km testing range until this week
