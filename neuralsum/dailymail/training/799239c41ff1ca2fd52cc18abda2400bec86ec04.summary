as the players in blue shirts trudged downcast into the tunnel , manager @entity0 cut a path between them towards the far corner of the @entity6 where travelling fans were united in jubilation			0
for @entity10 , who ended a goal drought stretching back to mid-august by twice coming from behind to draw — the point - saver arriving in the sixth minute of added time — this resembled a victory they are yet to savour in the @entity17			1
the two promoted sides have had vastly different starts in the top flight			0
while @entity10 have four points from four draws , @entity21 have scored 10 goals at home , a record that surpasses any other side in the @entity17			1

‘ i thought it was much more a reminder of what we are about , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ we started with a will and a demand			0
they were terrific from start to finish			0
’ @entity28 , who enjoyed the high of a dramatic 5 - 3 win over @entity93 in @entity21 ’s last home game , was seething			1
‘ i ’m annoyed , ’ he said , acknowledging that @entity21 , who had the lion ’s share of the chances , missed a plum opportunity to climb to fifth			1
‘ we ’re better than we were last season and they ’re not as good , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s disappointing because we should have won			0
it was a scrappy game , they did n’t come here to play fluid football , they came to be difficult to beat			0
’ @entity10 have lifted themselves off the bottom of the table by being consistent in defence , with the exception of last week ’s thrashing at @entity111			2
goals , meanwhile , have been hard to come by			0
their only other goal this campaign came in the 14th minute of the opening game of the season , a match they eventually lost 3 - 1 to @entity115			2
so @entity61 ’s strike , which levelled the score after @entity21 ’s opener , was very sweet after a wait of 10 hours and 54 minutes			1
however , it was three minutes too late to avoid breaking an unwanted club record set in the 1970 - 71 season of the longest spell without a goal			2
‘ i know we ’re creating chances , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ i thought we made a lot of good chances today but it ’s the quality of the chances that are important			0
' we ’re trying to build the team and make it learn quickly			0
@entity21 have been trying for this for years			2

@entity41 used his quick feet to confound @entity63 and squeeze a ball into the box which @entity158 took sweetly , angling into the top corner of the net			2
@entity10 made their mark when an @entity63 cross found @entity68 , who knocked the ball down with his head			2
@entity61 swept into the box to drive the ball past @entity34			2
@entity0 , who has acknowledged his side need to improve in front of goal , slung his water bottle towards nearby advertising hoardings and raised his hands above his head in applause before letting a few expletives fly			0
it had been a while			0
@entity21 , who have lost just once at home in their last 19 games , took just one minute to restore their lead through @entity41 , who has experienced a swift rise at @entity21 since arriving from @entity182 @entity184 side @entity183 nine months ago			1
the @entity186 international burst into the box to head in a cross from the excellent @entity45 , who combined well with @entity43 in the build - up to the goal			1
but a trip by @entity40 on @entity63 late in added time resulted in a free - kick and substitute @entity29 stepped up to fire home into the top corner from 20 yards to dramatically earn a share of the spoils , to the delight of @entity0			1
but @entity10 responded five minutes later as @entity61 ( right ) netted past @entity21 keeper @entity34 from close range and the midfielder celebrated in vociferous fashion with team - mate @entity64 but the lead lasted just two minute after riyad mahrez of @entity21 netted in the 41st minute to make it 2 - 1 and he celebrated with fellow goalscorer @entity43 ( right ) and defender @entity147 @entity45 of @entity21 attempts to climb over @entity58 of @entity10 in a fierce aerial battle a @entity10 fan reacts in the away stand at the @entity6 with his side at 2 - 1 down former @entity210 team - mates @entity67 ( left ) of @entity10 and @entity39 of @entity21 challenge in the air for possession @entity29 curled in a free - kick in the 96th minute to claim a dramatic point for @entity10 the midfielder celebrates vociferous after netting the stunning last - gasp equaliser			1

@entity10 midfielder @entity29 came off the bench to score *superb* last - minute free - kick
foxes forward @entity43 had given the home side the lead after 33 minutes
@entity61 levelled for the @entity10 soon after before @entity41 put @entity21 back in front
but @entity29 *denied* @entity28 's side all three points by scoring a 96th - minute leveller
