@entity1 defender @entity0 was left confused by the presence of two adjacent toilets after arriving in @entity4 for the @entity5			1
the @entity7 star took to @entity8 to share an image of the toilets , which were presumably located inside the @entity1 's @entity12 training base			1

@entity0 and his @entity1 team - mates will fly to @entity45 later this week as they prepare to face @entity46 in their @entity48 opener			2
