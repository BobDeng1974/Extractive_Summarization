though melanoma and other skin cancers are some of the most common in older people , it is extremely rare to see them in toddlers			1
but @entity6 and @entity7 found out the hard way it can still occur , when their two - year - old daughter @entity12 was diagnosed with a melanoma			1
' everyone was in shock , ' @entity7 told @entity16			2
' we saw her surgeon on a monday and he wanted to operate the next day			0
what started off as a small red spot ' the size of a pin - head ' on @entity12 's arm last year , quickly developed into a larger mark setting off alarm bells			1
' it started growing and we thought okay , this is a bit unusual ' , @entity7 , from @entity39 in @entity25 , said			2
from there a trip to the @entity45 and a follow - up appointment with a dermatologist put @entity12 on the fast - track to having surgery in april of this year			1
' she had one surgery and it came back as a spitzoid melanoma , ' @entity7 revealed			2
@entity12 then had to undergo a second surgery to create more of a buffer around the site where the tumor was			0
and although @entity12 did take a little while to recover from the surgery , she 's fighting fit now			0
mum @entity7 ( left ) and dad @entity6 ( top right ) were shocked by the one in five million diagnosis the youngster had to undergo two surgeries to completely remove the melanoma and now has rigorous and regular check - ups ' it took a couple of months for everything to settle down , her arm was quite swollen and the scar was quite red , ' her mum said			1
wanting to put a ' positive spin ' on the experience for their daughter , @entity6 and @entity7 named the scar her ' brave mark ' and taught @entity12 how to care for the sore on her own			1
' she puts her own little gel on there twice a day ' , @entity7 revealed			0
following the procedures @entity12 now requires regular and extensive check - ups and screenings , something she may have to undergo for the rest of her life			0
a check up two weeks ago put @entity12 in the clear , however her parents are awaiting more tests from overseas to find out more information about the tumor			1
for now , the two - year - old has to undergo lymph node tests and skin scans every three months , plus has had one pet scans so far and will require another later in the year			2
@entity12 's parents discovered a tiny red mark on her arm last year and were lucky enough to catch it early @entity12 's parents said they still have many questions about how their daughter got the disease so young although @entity12 has healed well from her procedures the @entity100 still have ' a lot of questions hanging over our heads			1
' ' we want to know why a two - year - old is presented with such a diagnosis , it 's obviously not sun - related as she 's only two , ' @entity7 revealed			1
@entity12 's surgeon was dr @entity111 , who works out of the @entity112 in @entity113			0
dr @entity111 told @entity16 that patients like @entity12 are ' unique and confronting ' but also particularly puzzling as there must be another cause for the cancer besides sun exposure			2
' there 's no family history with @entity12 , there 's nothing that we can really put our finger on at all , it 's a big mystery , ' he said			0
despite these rare instances , dr @entity111 said the occurrence of such cancers in young people in @entity25 is on the decline , and that 's a positive for the nation as a whole			0
' it suggests that the sun0 - smart message is getting through in @entity25 ' , he said			0
dr @entity111 also spoke to the @entity135 , telling them that while his young patient is cancer - free now , she will need to keep a close eye on things as she gets older			0
' it does n't mean we rest on our laurels			0
we still need to follow her up very closely , probably lifelong , since she 's had something so early ' , he said			0
@entity7 said there 's no way her melanoma could have been sun - related as @entity12 is so young this weekend @entity6 is taking part in the @entity151 and has already raised $ 7000 the @entity100 were lucky to catch their daughter 's melanoma early , but that 's not the case for all people diagnosed with what can be a devastating disease			1
however the @entity135 reported there are six new drugs which have been approved for @entity26 clinical trials , described by dr @entity111 as ' very exciting '			0
keen to assist research in the area , @entity6 is taking part in the @entity165 this weekend in @entity39 - which entails completing a gruelling 200 kilometre bike ride			2
he 's already raised over $ 7000 and hopes that some of the funds can contribute towards researching some of the rarer forms of cancer , like @entity12 's			1
the @entity100 also shared their experience following a breakfast at the weekend , held by the @entity173 in @entity25 , a centre that along with @entity175 has been of great assistance to @entity12 and @entity178 family this year			2
the @entity100 hope the funds raised can go towards research for rare cancers like the one @entity12 had			1
