by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 06:09 est , 2 may 2013 three hospital patients have died after contracting a new strain of the superbug @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
doctors in @entity5 have been alerted to the strain , named ribotype 332 , which has been reported for the first time by @entity8 ( @entity8 )			1
@entity8 said two patients being cared for at the same hospital died - one in december and the second in january			1
a third patient within the same health board area died last month			2
all were seriously ill with underlying conditions			2
doctors in @entity5 have been alerted to the new strain of clostridium difficile , named ribotype 332 @entity8 did not disclose the hospital locations due to patient confidentiality			1
a statement said : ' all three cases were severely ill due to other underlying conditions and died following their episode of @entity3 ( @entity22 difficile infection )			1
' this is the first published report of @entity25 ribotype 332 in the @entity26 and worldwide			1
the report said : ' all three cases were severely ill due to other underlying conditions and died following their episode of @entity3 ( @entity25 infection )			1
' @entity8 has alerted clinicians and laboratory staff throughout @entity5			2
' the identification of a novel ribotype does not require any immediate changes to surveillance or in the antibiotics used to treat @entity3			0
' a cdi is a type of bacterial infection that can affect the digestive system			0
it most commonly affects people who are staying in hospital			0
symptoms include diarrhoea and abdominal cramps and it can also cause life - threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel			0
two of the patients who died were cared for at the same hospital , while the third patient was being treated nearby			1
all were seriously ill with underlying conditions ( file picture ) @entity8 said new ribotypes have emerged ' frequently ' over the last decade			1
a ribotype is the pattern of dna fragments particular to a bacterial strain			2
@entity60 is the name given to the process of identifying this pattern which allows scientists to differentiate between different strains			0
@entity66 , strategic lead for microbiology at @entity8 , said the cases were not classed as an outbreak because the third case had not been linked to the first two			2
she told @entity72 : ' but it is an interesting finding that we have this same ribotype and we are doing further investigations to see if there are more patients with this ribotype			0
' past samples are now being re-examined to see if the 332 strain could be present and may have been missed			0
she said the 332 strain had occurred on one occasion previously somewhere in @entity84 , but this had not been the subject of an official report			0
“ it is quite a common event that new strains develop all the time			0
it is a natural evolution of genetics in the bacteria , ” she added .			0

the new strain , named ribotype 332 , has been reported for the first time by @entity8
two patients being cared for at the same hospital died - the third was being treated at a hospital nearby
all of the patients had underlying health conditions
