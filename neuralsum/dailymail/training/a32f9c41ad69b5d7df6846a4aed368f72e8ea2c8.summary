by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it has been a @entity3 rich in narrative – the heroes and villains jumping off the page - and on sunday night one last act will be penned ; it promises to be the captivating climax this tournament deserves			1
a record one billion people will devote 90 minutes – or more – to a television relaying the drama as it unfolds in the @entity13 ; make sure you ’re one of them			0
for do not allow your memory of previous finals to erode enthusiasm ahead of this one			0
relief : @entity21 celebrate their penalty - shootout victory over @entity24 in the semi-final destruction : @entity27 humiliated hosts @entity29 7 - 1 in their semi-final in @entity34 , four years ago , the most tedious tournament of recent times got the final it deserved , 120 minutes of boredom and brutality between @entity38 and @entity24 settled at the death by @entity40 , it even robbed us of a penalty shootout			1
this latest edition – thankfully – has been far removed from the depression of 2010			0
even @entity46 ’s early and entirely predictable exit has been forgotten amid the infectious , attacking spirit which has coursed through these finals			0
even the lesser contests – notably a handful of knockout matches – have hurtled to a conclusion in much the same manner as a playground battle with the bell about to sound			0
think the closing stages of @entity21 1 @entity57 0 , @entity27 2 @entity58 1 and @entity59 2 @entity60 1 and there you have football stripped of tactics but laced with tension			1
there have been individuals - @entity69 's @entity68 chief among them - underdogs - @entity70 had bark and bite - upsets - @entity38 's demise and @entity29 's capitulation the most shocking - goals - @entity76 's diving header this scribe 's favourite - and a few baddies thrown in to darken the plot , he who now resides in @entity77 the most villainous of them all			1
@entity27 and @entity21 , though , have been the best two teams in @entity29 and boast the protagonists to ink a fitting finale			1
@entity90 , you suspect , has been keeping something back for this occasion , the genius which hauled his side through the group stage set to sparkle once more with the prize in sight			2
while @entity95 carries the water , @entity90 turns it to wine and they will need their messiah to be at his mesmeric best to toast victory in @entity101 ; the stage , as they say , is set			2
i ( n the mood ? @entity21 will need @entity90 to be at his best if they 're to triumph leg up : five - goal @entity107 could prove the difference for @entity27 main men : @entity90 and @entity107 have been two of the best players on show in @entity29 the @entity113 : @entity114 has been immense in goal for the @entity116 tackle of the tournament : @entity95 denied @entity24 's @entity119 in the closing stages of the semi-final but @entity27 are favourites for good reason			1
their destruction of @entity29 in the semi-finals made for a confusing cocktail of pain and pleasure as a viewer , but it left an undeniably moreish taste			2
on sunday , we will get more			0
we will get more of the ' @entity113 ' , @entity114 , more of his club - mates @entity133 and @entity135 , the men who tease passes and torment opponents , and more of @entity107 , the player of whom it is said does n’t have a trick or turn of pace yet has still been the best in @entity29			1
that is the current vintage , factor in the history as well – this is their third final – and the stakes are heightened			0
it is 1 - 1 on finals won but @entity27 have proved @entity21 ’s nemesis in the last two tournaments , a 4 - 0 humiliation in @entity34 sure to motivate @entity90 and co. indeed , as many as 18 of the players from @entity158 could feature on sunday			1
if revenge serves as added motivation then so be it , but you get the feeling the incentive this time is far more pure – to be crowned champion of the greatest @entity3 in living memory , certainly of the colour - television age			2
we are set for one last illumination so be sure not to miss it .			0
