every year , @entity2 and his family return to his birth state on the sun - scorched shores of @entity15			1
and every year - until now - congressional squabbling has forced the @entity17 to delay their trip or cut it short			2
this year , @entity2 was cleared for an on - time departure by @entity20 , which defied pessimistic expectations last week by passing a bipartisan budget deal , all but ensuring the government wo n't shut down over the next two years			2
it was a far cry from presaging a new era of cooperation , to be sure , but a silver lining for @entity2 a day earlier as he acknowledged a year of frustrating ' ups and downs ' in an end - of - year news conference			0
the next morning @entity2 , typically an early riser , got a late start , staying at the home until early afternoon , when he headed to the golf course at a nearby @entity39 base			1

in previous years , frequent golf outings have accompanied trips to local restaurants and other island outings			0
a few weeks of low - key rest and relaxation would be a welcome change of pace for @entity2 , who reflected on a high - stakes year of brinkmanship and health care woes as he packed his bags for @entity7			1
' the end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year , ' @entity2 said friday			0
' i 'm sure that i will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun. ' last year , @entity2 had to temporarily abandon his vacation to fly home amid a congressional standoff over the so - called fiscal cliff			2
the year before , a showdown over payroll tax cuts forced him to delay the start of his @entity7 hiatus			0
in 2010 , it was congressional wrangling over repeal of the ban on gays in the military and other issues that delayed the trip			0
and in 2009 , @entity136 deliberations over @entity2 's signature health care law meant that @entity51 had to wait another few days			2
christmas traditions : the @entity2 will surely stop by @entity139 in @entity66 for some shaved ice , as they did in 2010 ( pictured ) the @entity2 's will cover the cost of their accommodation , but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill conditions seem ripe this year for a few weeks of interrupted family time			1
@entity2 did spend part of saturday morning conferring with top national security aides about the situation in @entity153 , where @entity52 military aircraft evacuating @entity52 from the violence - plagued @entity156 nation came under gunfire and had to divert to @entity159			1
the @entity79 said four @entity52 troops were injured in that incident			0
throughout his vacation @entity2 will continue to get regular briefings from advisers traveling with him , @entity79 officials said			0
@entity2 and his supporters were hoping those routine updates would n't interfere with regular rounds of golf and family outings for shave ice , the @entity7 version of a snow cone			1
' i do n't want any interruptions			0
he deserves a vacation , " @entity177 , an assistant principal visiting from @entity178 , @entity179 , said as he sipped a rum - infused drink dubbed the ' @entity181 ' at a @entity51 hotel			0
' he puts in too many hours to not have his vacation with his family			0
i know that 's what i would do			0
