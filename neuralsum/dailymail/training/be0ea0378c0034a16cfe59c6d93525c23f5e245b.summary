a new morning tv battle got underway today as @entity1 launched @entity2 - and while there was initial dismay at @entity7 's legs being hidden behind a desk , one media commentator believes the @entity9 should be worried about its latest rival to @entity11			1
@entity2 's predecessor , @entity13 , was viewed by roughly half the number of people that tuned into @entity11 , so @entity1 has a lot of ground to make up			1
but media analyst @entity18 believes it stands a fighting chance of succeeding , not least because of its poaching of ms @entity22			1
it 's a major move , but on paper it stands every chance of working			1
@entity7 is a great booking			2
' the question is whether @entity2 gets to know its audience and whether it gets the right tone			2
' mr @entity81 said that arrogance was the cause of @entity13 's failure			0
he said : ' with @entity13 corporate hubris took over at @entity1			0
in one fell swoop they demonstrated everything that can go wrong in one show			0
they hired @entity91 and @entity92 , an amazing partnership on @entity94 , but transplanting chemistry from one place to another is very hard to do			0
' he added : ' it would be really good , not least for the @entity9 , if @entity1 manage to make a success of @entity2 , because if it gets traction the @entity9 will be forced to react			2
not having competition is not good for the viewer			0
' ms @entity7 ’s @entity1 debut initially drew mixed reactions , with criticism that the show looked too similar to its @entity109 counterpart and that ms @entity7 ’s figure was obscured by a desk			1
as the show began viewers took to @entity37 to complain that the legs of the 43 - year - old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £ 400,000 and as much as £ 1million a year - were hidden from view			1
one viewer commented : ' why has @entity1 paid so much for @ susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk ? its like buying a @entity122 and keeping it in the garage # gmb			0
' another wrote : ' you do n't hire @entity7 and then stick her behind a desk # getyourpinsout # @entity127			2
' the dismay was short - lived , though , as ms @entity7 , dressed in a knee - length red dress , soon moved to a sofa			1
speaking recently about the desk and the new set of the show , @entity7 said : ' our set is different , fresh and it 's not what people have been used to over the last couple of years in breakfast television			1
' it is something new and exciting for us			0
we all start behind the desk , which has n't happened for a while			0
' criticism that the show ’s studio and layout resembled @entity146 ’s @entity35 may take longer to shake off			0
relief for fans : ms @entity7 's legs were later on show as she and mr @entity54 interviewed @entity66 the big reveal : @entity7 later moved and showed off her legs in her knee - length dress back for more : old favourites including celebrity correspondent @entity154 were back for the new show one viewer wrote on @entity37 : ' @entity2 is too formal and newsy and like an @entity109 morning show			1
' while another added : ' well , @entity2 looks very @entity109 so far ... suited team behind desks , tickers , huge pic takes up half screen			1
' @entity165 anchor @entity164 told @entity68 that she found the show - co-hosted by @entity54 , 39 , @entity166 , 28 and @entity167 , 30 - too frantic			1
the presenter , who was a reporter on @entity2 's distant cousin , tv - am , in 1985 , said : ‘ the show itself is just too busy for me at the moment but i 'm sure it 'll settle down after a couple of weeks			1
‘ breakfast viewers just need to know that the world is still turning , they can get to work on time and what the weather is doing ... ' but she added : ‘ i love @entity7			2
i think she has all the ingredients a great presenter needs			0
@entity184 , presentable , serious when she needs to be and fun when she does n't			0
’ co-presenters : @entity54 , left , and @entity166 , right , who joined @entity1 from @entity165 as it was : @entity188 and @entity189 on @entity13 , before it was reinvented as @entity2 monday ’s viewing figures for @entity11 and @entity2 will be released tomorrow			1
on average 12.4m people watch breakfast each week , according to the @entity9			0
bookmaker @entity193 believes there is a fair chance @entity197 may not be with the show in a year 's time , with even money on the presenter no longer being a host 12 months from now			2
spokesman @entity203 said : ' you would expect the first day to be a little chaotic , but we felt the chemistry was not there and the show could struggle in its current format			0
' @entity7 sneaked out the back of @entity1 's studio on the @entity212 over an hour after filming finished and was driven out in a black @entity213			2
she tweeted : ' thanks for all your tweets # @entity127 - back tomorrow at 6am			0
' early arrival : @entity7 was without make - up as she arrived for her first day on the show clutching her laptop and the day 's papers sitting pretty : @entity7 's previous role at @entity11 saw her put on a much more leggy display			1

viewers took to @entity37 to complain that @entity7 's legs were hidden
there was also criticism that the show looked too @entity109
@entity165 anchor @entity164 said @entity2 was ' too busy '
@entity7 , 43 , is reportedly being paid £ 400,000 for her new role
