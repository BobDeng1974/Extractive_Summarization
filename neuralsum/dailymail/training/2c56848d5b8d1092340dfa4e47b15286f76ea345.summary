by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 3:45 pm on 10th january 2012 emergency : @entity4 's parent 's are taking him to @entity5 for immediate treatment a mother yesterday flew her son to @entity5 for a lifesaving operation after two @entity11 hospitals delayed his treatment for lack of beds			1
fearing another 11th - hour cancellation , @entity15 has spent £ 10,000 taking @entity4 abroad for immediate treatment for neuroblastoma , a form of cancer			1
the seven - year - old will be operated on tomorrow at the @entity22 in an attempt to remove three diseased lymph nodes			1
last night , miss @entity25 , 43 , told the @entity26 : ‘ i feel like @entity4 ’s country has let him down			1
' i have had to fight , argue and question everything along the way to help my son			2
‘ i just hope we ’re in time – it could already be too late			2
' i dread to think what would have happened if we ’d stayed in @entity37			2
’ @entity4 began showing symptoms of the disease in october 2008			1
he saw two gps , both of whom missed the neuroblastoma , passing the swelling off as a stomach upset			2
finally , a third gp referred him for tests			0
@entity4 was diagnosed with grade four neuroblastoma , a cancer of the developing nervous tissue			1
there was a 5in - long tumour in his stomach			0
miss @entity25 said : ‘ the specialist came in to examine @entity4			1
he lifted up his t - shirt and said : ' how in @entity58 ’s name did two doctors miss that ? '' @entity4 was referred to @entity60 where he began chemotherapy in march 2009 and then a procedure to remove the tumour			1
the hospital told @entity25 and her partner @entity65 , 42 , a forklift truck driver , there could still be ‘ residual disease ’ around the tumour site			0
tragic : @entity70 when she was aged three pictured left and @entity4 pictured right , when he was aged five , were both diagnosed with neuroblastoma no other option : @entity4 , pictured centre with his parents , @entity65 left , and @entity15 , right who are taking him abroad for a lifesaving operation more chemotherapy followed but a delay for a separate illness meant @entity4 missed the deadline for a vital course of antibody therapy			1
the @entity11 paid for this in @entity5 where doctors removed a tumour near @entity4 ’s heart that surgeons at @entity60 had deemed too dangerous to treat			1
incredibly , the @entity89 medics had not told @entity4 ’s family about it			2
miss @entity25 added : ‘ i feel the @entity11 has let my son down at every stage			0
it is incredible that i have to go to @entity5			0
‘ it is disgusting that this country does n’t offer everything it can to save these children			2
it ’s like we live in a third world country			0
’ although @entity4 was given the all - clear in february 2011 , a follow - up scan in may in @entity5 showed three diseased lymph nodes in his abdomen			1
drug treatment failed and the family was told last month that @entity4 needed another operation			1
although a surgeon was available at @entity112 ’s @entity111 on december 22 , no paediatric beds were free until january 19			0
miss @entity25 ’s complaints saw her offered an operation at @entity60 on january 4			2
but this was cancelled barely half an hour before @entity4 left for hospital			2
again , a bed shortage was blamed			0
‘ i phoned the consultant in @entity5 and he could do it right away , ’ miss @entity25 said			0
‘ i just got straight on the phone to book flights			0
it was my son ’s life and i did n’t care how much it cost			0
‘ every day counts with this disease and i would n’t be able to live with myself if the @entity11 delay cost him his life			0
’ @entity128 , a consultant paediatric oncologist at @entity60 who has been caring for @entity4 since 2009 , said : ‘ unfortunately , our unit was extraordinarily busy with critically ill children needing help to breathe , so his operation was rescheduled			1
’ a spokesman for @entity135 said : ‘ the first date we offered for @entity4 ’s operation was january 19 , which the family have chosen not to accept , and therefore we have n’t cancelled any surgery			1
’ a @entity142 spokesman said : ' we understand the @entity143 is looking into this case			0
we would expect the @entity11 at local level to make sure they have the right number of paediatric intensive care beds to meet the demands of their local population			0
' in keeping with the rest of the @entity11 in @entity37 , the local health service in the @entity152 is receiving annual real terms increases in funding in each year of this @entity156			0

parents have spent £ 10,000 taking @entity4 abroad for immediate treatment for neuroblastoma , a rare form of cancer that only affects children
@entity165 will undergo an operation tomorrow in an attempt to remove three diseased lymph nodes
