historians fear the items they took - 18 irreplaceable ' culturally significant ' jade antiques worth between £ 5 million and £ 15 million - may never be seen again			1
jailed : @entity18 , left , and @entity19 , right , were two of the gang members jailed for the raid caught on camera : all of the group , apart from @entity23 , were captured on @entity25 before the raid police believe the artefacts have all been sold to rich private collectors			1
mr @entity29 described the raid as an act of ' cultural vandalism ' as he passed sentence a @entity12 @entity33			1
he said : ' this resulted in the loss to the museum and the public at large , not only in this country but across the world , of pieces of incalculable cultural significance and many millions of pounds in monetary value			2
' the likelihood is they passed into private hands and will not be seen again for many generations , if at all			1
' save for the individuals or individual who commissioned this raid , they are effectively lost forever			1
' they are rare and beautiful objects and i draw the irresistible inference that they have gone or will go to one or more private collectors			1
' @entity19 , 25 , of @entity55 , east @entity56 , @entity18 , 24 , of @entity57 , @entity58 , and a 29 - year - old man from @entity56 , who can not be named for legal reasons , will each serve six years after admitting conspiracy to burgle			1

he was sentenced to a four month detention and training order			0
six of the rare @entity5 artefacts stolen from @entity12 's @entity11			1
police believe they have been sold to wealthy private collectors the haul has never been recovered and some of the items may have been damaged as the gang fled , the court heard			1
defence counsel told the court ' others higher up the chain ' , who have not been identified , recruited the men to target the jade exhibits			1
among the items stolen were six pieces from the @entity81 , including a 16th century carved jade buffalo , a carved horse from the 17th century and a green and brown jade elephant			1
a jade cup and vase , which is carved with bronze designs , was also stolen , along with an opaque jade brush washer			2
' the case has caused tremendous shock to the staff			0
they are concerned in case there is a further burglary ' @entity96 , acting director of the @entity11 @entity96 , acting director of the @entity97 , said in a statement read to the court that the raid had damaged the museum ’s precious reputation for ' guarding treasures '			1
he added that staff had been shocked by the ' brutal ' destruction of the @entity5 gallery			0
mr @entity96 said : ' the case has caused tremendous shock to the staff			0
they are concerned in case there is a further burglary , certainly if it were to take place during the daytime			0
' the museum has spent nearly £ 16,000 repairing the damage			2
prosecutor @entity119 said none of the defendants had helped police identify where the artefacts might be			2
mr @entity119 said : ' the conspiracy clearly involved others not known to the prosecution			0
' it is very difficult to value these items but various estimates place the value at between £ 5 million and £ 15 million			1
lost forever ? historians fear the artefacts - 12 of which are pictured here - will never be seen again ' clearly many of these items were deliberately targeted by the defendants because others which could have been taken were not			1
' he added that a disc cutter was used to create a hole in a metal shutter before smashing a window			0
two men entered the building where they forced open two reinforced display cases			0
all of the group , apart from @entity23 , had been caught on @entity25 before the raid , examining the cabinets			2
they were traced using this footage , a fingerprint taken from a brochure which had been handled by the 29 - year - old the day before the burglary , and dna evidence linked to @entity23			2
mitigating , @entity159 said the 29 - year - old claimed he had been pressurised into taking part and was not a ' professional burglar '			2
he added : ' others were involved in this and he is not somebody with a treasure trove stashed away for future use			0
acting director @entity96 said the raid had damaged the museum 's precious reputation for ' guarding treasures ' @entity173 , for @entity19 , said : ' he has lived a pitiful existence and has had problems with drink and cannabis since the age of 11 and class a drugs since the age of 16			1
' he had been released from prison for another offence just eight days before the burglary			0
@entity185 said her client , @entity18 , was of limited intellect and had never attended secondary school			0
he was not physically involved in the burglary but took part in its planning			0
@entity23 accepted that he had breached two earlier conditional discharges			0
his barrister , @entity192 , said : ' he did not enter the building			0
he was recruited the afternoon before the burglary and does not know what happened after it			0
' he was thoroughly exploited and was selected for his naivety			0
