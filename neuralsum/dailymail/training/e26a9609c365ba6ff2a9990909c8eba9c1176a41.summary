the garden entitled ' @entity1 ' is the work of designer @entity3 the taxpayer is to spend almost £ 100,000 designing and building a garden featuring an ' avenue of dead trees ' at the @entity9 , @entity4 can reveal			2
ministers claim the extraordinary use of government money will help educate the public on the dangers of pests and diseases which threaten @entity18 ’s flora and fauna			1
but critics condemned the ' frippery ' of the ‘ cock - eyed ’ plan at a time when 60 experts in forest research have been sacked as part of government cost - cutting			1
the embattled @entity28 , which signed off the idea , is already under fire for cuts to flood defences and animal disease controls , and its role in the system failure which saw horsemeat sold in beefburgers			0
now it has emerged ministers have agreed to a garden at the @entity9 in may , entitled ‘ @entity41 ’			0
the £ 95,000 cost for the design and build is largely coming from the coffers of @entity28 , which suffered some of the deepest cuts of the coalition austerity programme			1
also chipping in are the @entity49 , the @entity50 and @entity52 governments and the @entity53 and @entity54			0
it is the work of award - winning designer @entity3 who has been hired by the @entity57 to highlight the issue of plant disease ' in a way never seen before '			2
it comes after the government was heavily criticised for its handing of the outbreak of ash dieback disease which threatened @entity18 's 80million ash trees			1
government agency @entity57 has hired award - winning designer @entity3 to come up with the concept for the display publicity material for the bizarre stunt explains how the garden will be split into two zones : beautiful and ugly			1
a sunken garden featuring ' quintessential native trees and lush shade - loving planting ' will be ' starkly contrasted with sinister and shocking elements '			2
ministers have rejected a tax on plastic bags , fearing a backlash from hard - pressed shoppers			0
@entity82 is set to be the only country in the @entity18 which allows free bags , with a charge already in place in wales and both @entity88 and @entity52 preapring to impose a levy			0
but environment minister @entity90 has again ruled out the idea			1
' we are currently assessing various measures to reduce the distribution of single use carrier bags , ' he said			0
' however , we recognise the pressures on household budgets at this time ; levying even a small charge may not be the best option			0
' these include ' an avenue of dead trees ' , an ' ominous ' pool with an island holding a single sapling , and concrete - panelled walls			0
dr @entity108 , head of plant health public engagement at @entity57 , said : it ’s really important that we all work together to help protect the @entity18 countryside for future generations to enjoy			0
this garden is a “ call to arms ” to the great @entity18 public to help stop the spread by changing our behaviour , even in small ways			1
' the message of the garden is : ' @entity18 trees and plants are under threat from pests , diseases and invasive species – help us stop the spread ! ' organisers hope it will persuade the public to wash their boots after walking in the countryside , buy plants locally and dispose of garden waste properly			1
but former forestry minister @entity135 , who unearthed the costs in parliamentary questions , condemned the extraordinary use of public money			1
‘ i love @entity142 , i love all flower shows			0
i wish them to flourish , ’ the @entity141 mp said			2
‘ but the idea that we are sacking 60 people in forest research and spending £ 95,000 on a show garden for two weeks at @entity9 trying to communicate to people the danger of forest disease strikes me as the most cock - eyed , inverted , upside - down , arse - over - tit , cart - before - horse proposal i have ever heard			1
' more than 150,000 people attend the @entity9 every year but the decision to use public money to design and build a garden at the event has been condemned in the 2010 spending review @entity28 's budget by 30 per cent , well above the @entity163 average of 19 per cent			1
mr @entity135 went on : ‘ where are their priorities ? it is absolutely typical			2
it is all about public perception			0
it is all about putting a brave face on things			0
environment minister @entity90 said the garden would ' deliver strong messages to the public ' ‘ how any civil servant had the guile to go to a minister and say “ would n’t it be a really good idea that would show the public we are doing something about pathogens to have a garden at @entity9 ? ” i just do not know			1
and then the minister says “ what a good idea ”			0
’ environment minister @entity90 claimed the garden will ‘ deliver strong messages to the public on the scope for behaviour change to make a significant impact on the prevention and identification of pests and pathogens that could affect our trees , including the threat from non-native species ’			1
the show garden at the two - week event in central @entity203 is ‘ just one element of a campaign of public and stakeholder communication regarding tree health and plant biosecurity ’ , he added			1
‘ all of these activities are aimed at addressing threats which have huge potential to change how our landscape looks , severely damage our biodiversity and wildlife , and can have significant impacts on the @entity18 economy			0
’ but @entity219 , chief executive of the @entity220 ’ @entity222 campaign group , said : ' taxpayers will be stupefied that ministers are shelling out nearly £ 100,000 on a show garden for a fortnight at the @entity9			1
' @entity28 has got its priorities completely wrong if that is deemed to be the best use of the money as there are far cheaper ways of communicating messages about diseases in trees and plants			0
the @entity28 needs to get its spending under control and cut out waste on this kind of frippery			2
' in a statement mr @entity90 said : tree health is an issue of great importance and it is vital that we use international events such as this to help address the problems we are facing			2
' every leading organisation with which we need to engage will be at this event and the garden will highlight the importance of bio security and the impact tree diseases could have if we do not work together to tackle them			0
