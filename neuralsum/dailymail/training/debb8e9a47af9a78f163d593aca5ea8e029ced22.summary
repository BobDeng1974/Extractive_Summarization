by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 10:36 est , 18 february 2013 a mother who was left paralysed and unable to speak by a blood clot on her brain has learnt to walk and talk again - after copying her toddler daughter			1
@entity5 , 35 , was given the life changing news that she had two aneurysms when her daughter @entity9 was just 10 months old			1
and her life hung in the balance when she suffered a massive bleed to the brain following an operation to remove them			1
miracle recovery : @entity5 , left , recovered from a bleed on the brain which left her paralysed by learning to walk and talk again at the same time as her daughter @entity9 doctors warned devastated husband @entity22 , 36 , that even if she did survive , @entity5 could be left with terrible brain damage			1
though she survived , she was left unable to walk , talk or sit up			1
but two years on she has stunned doctors with her recovery - learning to walk and talk alongside her daughter			1
@entity5 , from @entity31 , said : ' i could n't have recovered as well as i have without the support of @entity22 , and of course , @entity9			1
' i was so determined to get better to look after @entity9 - i wanted to run around with her in the park and be the best mum i could			1
' i did n't want her to be running around while i was still stuck in my wheelchair - so it became a bit of a race to see which one of us would take our first steps			0
she added : ' @entity9 beat me by a week - but once we 'd both mastered taking one step , we progressed together , one step at a time			2
' she 's actually slightly better than me now - she can stand on one leg , which i 'll never be able to do			0
' @entity9 is such a caring little girl , and wise beyond her years - i was lucky to have such a wonderful medical and nursing team both in hospital and after i was discharged at home			2
' mother - of - one @entity5 was diagnosed with the aneurysm after suffering numbness in her right side while putting @entity9 to bed on @entity58 2010			1
support : @entity5 , pictured with daughter @entity9 and husband @entity22 , was diagnosed with two aneurysms when @entity9 was just 10 months old long struggle : @entity5 is pictured recovering after surgery left her unable to walk , talk , or even sit up she thought that she had suffered a stroke but later found it was her nerves were being affected by the mass of blood vessels growing on her brain			1
although surgeons thought that surgery would solve the problem , they discovered that she had an extra bone in her skull that ruled out a successful operation			0
she was eventually admitted for surgery after 10 months of tests and 17 brain scans she was admitted in october 2010			1
medics initially thought that the three - and - a - half hour operation had been a success			0
but her condition began to deteriorate and a specialist spotted a blood clot on her brain while examining her several days later			0
when the clot started to bleed she was rushed for more emergency surgery with doctors fearing she would die			2
devastating : mother - of - one @entity5 , pictured , left , with husband @entity22 , was diagnosed with the aneurysm after suffering numbness in her right side while putting @entity9 , centre , to bed on @entity58 2010 @entity5 said : ' the surgeons took @entity22 to one side and told him i was very , very ill , and i might not pull through the surgery			1
' they told him that if i survived , the chances were that i 'd be seriously brain damaged , and they did n't know to what extent i would recover			0
' he was obviously devastated , and now it hurts me so much to think of the pain he must have gone through , which i was totally unaware of			0
' when i came round after the surgery , i could n't move			0
i wanted to speak , and sit up and get out of bed , but i could n't move			0
' i was terrified and frustrated - and i did n't know whether i would ever be able to walk or talk again			2
' the nurses would come to me every day and hold up a pen and ask me if i knew what it was			0
' in my head , i was screaming the word " pen " , but it would n't come out of my mouth			0
' i practised and practised while i was lying there by myself , and after two weeks , i was able to say it			0
' it took a long time before i was able to speak coherently , and in long sentences , though			0
' when @entity9 said her first word in march 2011 , we were suddenly both trying to talk all the time , with our speech eventually getting more and more sophisticated at the same pace			1
' she took her first step in may 2011 , and i took mine two weeks later in june			0
however , it took months before i was able to walk long distances - and when we both got tired of walking , we both had a sit down in my wheelchair together			1
@entity5 underwent tests in december and doctors say that her body has made an 85 per cent recovery			2
she said : ' i sometimes get a bit tired if i 've been on my feet all day , but @entity9 is always there to look after me			2
i do n't know what i would have done without her			0
' i have thrown myself into fundraising for my own charity , the @entity141 , and @entity142 , which helps support people who have suffered brain or head injuries			2
' two years ago , i did n't know if i 'd ever be able to sit up and give my daughter a cuddle - i 'm so happy we can run around and play together now			0
' learning : while the pair were learning to walk , both @entity5 , left , and @entity9 , right , would rest by sitting together in @entity5 's wheelchair			1
