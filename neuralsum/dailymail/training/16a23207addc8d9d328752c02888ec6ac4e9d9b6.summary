the lack of @entity1 handed @entity2 the opportunity to make the bench for the first time in his @entity7 career			1
but what do we know about the 17 - year - old ? @entity11 takes a look			2
who is he ? @entity2 is one in a crop of bright youngsters coming through the ranks at @entity17 and ought to make some sort of impact on the first team sooner rather than later			1
a pacey striker , his goals fired the @entity23 to an @entity25 trophy last season and scored consecutive hat - tricks in the competition			0
@entity2 actually only turned 17 a month ago but has already played for the club ’s @entity29 and in the @entity31			1
he scored 18 goals while leading the line for the academy side last year and his sharpness in front of goal means @entity49 has no qualms in throwing the teenager into the first team squad			1
why do i recognise his name ? this might be why			0
‘ my conscience tells me that if , for example , [ @entity58 ] @entity57 , [ @entity60 ] @entity59 , and @entity2 are not national team players in a few years , i should blame myself , ’ said @entity49 in the summer			1
a real ringing endorsement , but with it comes a touch of added pressure			0
he has recently signed a three - year deal with the league leaders			0
serious faith in his ability			0
@entity49 said that if @entity2 was not a senior @entity34 player in a few years he would blame himself is he @entity72 ? very much so			1
@entity2 scored the winner for @entity34 ’s @entity74 against @entity75 last month and - should he start playing games in the cup for @entity7 or go out on loan - ca n’t be far away from @entity79 ’s @entity29			1
a word of warning , though			0
@entity2 is eligible to play for @entity82 - his dad ’s country of birth			2
is he more a @entity86 or @entity87 ? certainly more in the mould of @entity87 in that he ’s quick over five yards and can leave defenders for dead given the chance to run at them			0
but he is well - built for his age and appears to have the muscle needed to make a fist of senior football sooner rather than later			0
@entity2 takes a shot while playing for the @entity34 under 18 side against @entity97 last month			2

@entity1 missed the match against @entity100 *due* to *injury*
@entity2 was then *promoted* to the subs bench for the first time
but who is @entity2 , and why does @entity49 rate him so *highly* ?
