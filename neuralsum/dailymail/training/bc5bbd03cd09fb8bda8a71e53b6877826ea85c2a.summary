with @entity8 fighting for his life in a hospital in @entity15 , for all connected with @entity4 the swift return to action with this weekend 's inaugural @entity12 @entity11 has been tough to endure , and especially for his team @entity16			1
as a mark of respect , the team confirmed ahead of first practice on friday they would run only one car , that of @entity8 's team - mate @entity22			1
@entity0 set the pace in the second session 1			2
@entity53 1:44.952 despite placing reserve @entity54 on standby to deputise on thursday , @entity16 said their decision was ' the appropriate course of action under the difficult circumstances of the weekend '			0
the team , however , have still prepared the second car , which is to sit on @entity8 's side of the garage for the remainder of the weekend , and with his name over the entrance			2
it is understood to have been a tough decision to make for sporting director @entity70 and team principal @entity71 , who remains at @entity8 's bedside at the @entity73 in @entity74			0
@entity22 expressed himself to be ' truly devastated ' with regard to @entity8 's situation after the 25 - year - old sustained brain injuries from a high - speed collision with a recovery vehicle at @entity80			0

with three successive wins behind him to open up a 10 - point cushion over @entity30 team - mate @entity23 at the top of standings , @entity0 finished the day comfortably ahead of his main title rival			1
around @entity4 's newest venue , the @entity94 that was at the heart of the winter olympics earlier this year , @entity0 has quickly mastered what appears to be far from a tricky track technically			1
@entity23 was almost nine tenths down on @entity30 team - mate @entity0 in second practice the 29 - year - old @entity107 , with the teams switching to the faster soft - compound @entity104 tyres in the afternoon session after running mediums in the morning , posted a lap of one minute 39.630 seconds			2

@entity23 , quickest in the morning run , had to settle for fourth , just over nine tenths of a second off of @entity0 's pace			1
@entity34 duo @entity34 , whose first set of @entity119 in @entity120 were ruined by an overheating tyre blanket so delaying his maiden foray onto the track , and @entity36 , were fifth and seventh quickest respectively			0
@entity8 's @entity16 is vacant this weekend after the @entity126 - based team did not enter a driver in his place @entity35 provided the filling in that particular sandwich , with @entity31 showing a return to form as they are pushing both @entity113 and @entity34			2
home hero @entity37 was eighth best in his @entity38 , with four - times champion @entity39 and @entity41 in the second @entity38 completing the top 10 , the latter nearly two seconds down			0
@entity113 's @entity42 has so far struggled to get to grips with the circuit , with the @entity136 11th			0
the only man who can deny either @entity0 or @entity23 the title , @entity40 's @entity44 , was down in 13th place , with his session over seven minutes from the end due to a mechanical issue with his car			1
as for the sole @entity16 of @entity52 , the 23 - year - old @entity107 was 20th of the 21 on track , but nearly five seconds adrift , leaving @entity146 's @entity145 to bring up the rear .			0
