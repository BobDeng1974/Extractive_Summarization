@entity0 vs @entity2 tickets are the hottest property in town			1
only 500 were on general sale with the rest distributed by the fighters , promoters , television networks @entity9 and @entity10 and the @entity11			1
one fan , @entity12 , 34 , from @entity13 was lucky enough to get hold of a ticket when they were released last week and here he tells us his story and his hopes for the fight			1
i booked the trip to @entity23 back on december 13			2
one of my friends , @entity25 , was convinced the fight was going to happen and we needed to book it before it was announced and the prices sky - rocketed			1
so we booked it and waited for the announcement			2
@entity32 and @entity33 came and went and the fight was not announced			1
then it looked like it was going to be announced during half - time of the @entity37			2
then we thought it was going to be announced during the @entity41 all - star game			2
@entity12 ( second right ) and friends at @entity45 before jetting off to @entity23 @entity12 and his friends booked their trip to @entity23 back in december in anticipation for the big fight the email confirmation that showed @entity12 had bought a ticket for the biggest fight but eventually it was announced late one friday in february and we could not believe it was finally going to happen			1
even though we had our flights and hotel booked we were not sure if we were going to be able to get tickets as we thought that hardly any would be released and they would be sold to the big companies for the most amount of money			1
we thought the whole thing was being orchestrated to make the most amount of money possible			0
but all four of us had been to @entity23 before and we always said that if we were to go again then it would have to be for a big event or fight like this , so we thought it was worth going even if we did n't get a ticket			1
one of my friends in the group had been in @entity23 for both @entity73 vs @entity0 and @entity73 vs @entity2			1
he said it would be insane and that we had to go			0
then it was announced last week that a limited number of tickets would go on sale at 8pm on thursday night			1
we all agreed to try and get tickets			1
but my problem was i going to fit camp with my mum on thursdays and it was the last one , and if i did n't go then she would n't go , and i am trying to encourage her			0
so we went to the gym and i was looking at the clock the whole time			0
we did the session and the warm - down and at 7.55pm i sprinted out of the gym and into the car and was trying to get online while in the car			0
we drove to my mum 's house and by the time i got there it was 8.09pm and i got the laptop out and went on to the @entity96 website			0
@entity12 and friends are staying at @entity98 on the vegas strip overlooking the famous fountain in front of the @entity103 hotel i put in for four tickets			1
two and then one , same thing			0
i kept trying and trying and was changing the price bracket and number of tickets and then at 8.15pm i got through and it said on the screen that i had one ticket			2
it was $ 7,924.40 ( £ 5,141.68 ) but i realised i was on my business partner 's laptop and it did not have all my credit card details saved as mine does			2
so i had to sprint out of the house to my car to try and find my card and race back , by the time i got back to the laptop and put in my details there was about 45 seconds left on the countdown timer			0
in panic when i was filling everything in i clicked the box for insurance and ended up paying an extra $ 455			2
i 'm not even sure what it is insurance for ! @entity12 and the boys stopped off at the famous @entity134 gym in @entity135 where @entity2 trained for the fight @entity12 and his friends are planning a trip to the @entity139 in the days before the big fight the group plan to head back to @entity23 via @entity142 and the @entity144 desert then it was all confirmed and i thought it was all too easy , and had i really managed to get a ticket ? or was it a scam and had i been turned over for just over £ 5,000 ? but then an email came through from @entity96 and i could not believe i had managed to get one			1
i then went on to our group @entity152 and just wrote ' i got a ticket ' and the phone just went mad with messages asking to see a screen shot			0
and when i sent it everyone just went mad , no one could believe it			0
my business partner , @entity162 , has been on @entity163 and he thinks he may have tracked down a ticket in the row behind me and the person may be willing to sell it , so we may possibly have two tickets			2
the group plan a big night out on friday on the famous @entity23 strip the @entity11 pool party at the @entity11 is on the agenda for saturday we flew out from @entity45 on wednesday and we 're staying at the @entity173 just down the @entity23 from the @entity11			1
after a ' quiet ' night on wednesday , we are going on a road trip to @entity175 and the @entity139			0
we are spending one night there and then coming back to @entity23 on friday via the sights of @entity142 and the @entity144 desert			0
we 'll have a big night out on friday and then chill out on saturday at the @entity180 at the @entity181 hosted by dj @entity182			0
and then it is fight night ! @entity184 beat @entity185 in front of 80,000 fans at @entity188 @entity12 had good seats for the @entity184 vs @entity185 fight at @entity191 in may last year @entity192 and @entity193 were two of the ' celebrities ' at the @entity184 vs @entity185 fight - but a-listers are expected to be in attendance at the @entity11 on saturday night i have been to big events in the past , i was at @entity184 vs @entity185 at @entity191 and we had good seats for that			1
we saw people from @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206			0
but @entity23 is going to be the real a-list			0
i have had some good trips in the past as well , a friend of mine is @entity211 's @entity210 and she invited me to his island a few years ago , so i 've spent a few days chilling out there , it was insane			0
i never thought that holiday would be topped			0
@entity12 will be one of 16,000 fans who will pack into the @entity217 on saturday night @entity0 will face @entity2 in the richest fight in boxing history but already this trip promises to be amazing , the atmosphere in @entity23 will be amazing ahead of the fight , everyone will be buzzing			1
in terms of the fight , i would like to see @entity2 win			1
he has not got anything to lose			0
@entity0 is flash and that is liked in @entity230 , but around the world the whole money thing is not liked as much			1
either way i hope it is a great fight and a great occasion .			2

@entity0 will fight @entity2 on may 2 at @entity11
tickets were officially sold for as much as $ *10,000*
