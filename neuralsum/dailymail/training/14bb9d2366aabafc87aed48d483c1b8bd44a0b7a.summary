the @entity0 is dead , long live the @entity0			0
if there were fears @entity4 would lose their potency with the dissolving of @entity7 and @entity9 ’s partnership , a new double act may have emerged			1
@entity9 and @entity10 is not a partnership in the sense of the original @entity0 – that phrase was coined for @entity15 ’s @entity14 and @entity16 in the 1990s – nor are they going to have an alliance like the one @entity9 and @entity7 formed so thrillingly during the last 101 - goal season			1
but there have been glimpses this summer that @entity9 and @entity10 , the men whose strikes gave @entity4 a crucial opening weekend win against @entity25 , may yet develop a rapport that keeps @entity28 ’ side in the thick of the top four			1
@entity9 has to show he can handle the responsibility of being the main man at a big club – his numbers certainly suggest he is up to the task – whereas @entity10 must prove he can making another significant , stylish leap forward			1
judging on the evidence of this summer , and against @entity25 , @entity10 is primed to leave the form of his breakthrough campaign behind and establish himself not only as the number one young player in the country but one of the most exciting talents in @entity54			1
@entity10 was the subject of much chatter before the game and one stalwart of the press room , a man who know knows what it means to pull on a red shirt , revealed his hopes for the 19 - year - old when saying he had backed him to @entity67 – and for the top prize , too			2
attacking threat : @entity70 will hope he can provide the service for @entity10 and @entity9 up front given the way @entity10 played in the game itself , it was easy to see why such a bold investment had been made			1
he took his goal with great aplomb , scampering onto a precise pass from @entity81 , to slip his effort beyond @entity83			0
it is likely to be the first of many this season			2
‘ when you ’re so young , it ’s important to understand exactly what your role is , ’ @entity28 said last week			0
‘ it ’s not just about looking good , you have to be efficient and effective			0
his development has gone to a new level			0
he ’s way above the level from when he first came in			0
the work rate and strength was as redoubtable as always but what really impressed in @entity10 ’s performance was his awareness and composure , late in the game , to jump up and head a ball into the path of @entity9 to score the winning goal			1
lethal : @entity7 and @entity9 formed a devastating partnership before the @entity109 left for @entity110 @entity28 , caught up in the moment , sped on to the pitch and punched the air			2
this was a crucial victory , make no mistake , and while @entity7 ’s absence will be keenly felt , a significant amount of solace can be taken from the fact that @entity9 has a habit of producing at a rapid frequency			1
‘ that is 36 goals in 50 appearances , which is the best of any striker in @entity4 ’s history , ’ @entity28 pointed out			1
‘ that shows the level he is at			0
he always looks like he will score			0
it was a poacher ’s goal , one of those where you anticipate a knockdown			0
it is now a continuation for him			0
’ when you consider some of the names he has eclipsed – @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity7 – it is a remarkable achievement and shows the consistency he has achieved since his £ 12million move from @entity148 in january 2013			2
@entity4 may need a new striker before the transfer window closes , with @entity151 and @entity152 among the options being discussed , but their current first choice has built an impressive foundation for himself			2
gone : @entity4 sold @entity7 to @entity110 for £ 75million this summer but have a new @entity0 partnership the next target would be surpass @entity144 , who reached 50 @entity159 goals in 72 appearances , and with @entity9 - the top goalscorer in the top flight in 2014 - having bagged 32 in 44 matches , he must be odds - on to break that record , too , given the chances @entity4 can create when at their best			1
having @entity10 providing pace , guile and another headache for opposing defenders to deal with might also help @entity9 ’s cause and , if that is to be the case , the @entity0 would again become a recurring theme of @entity4 ’s campaign			1
@entity28 , for one , will be hoping that is the case			0
‘ we will get better , ’ he beamed afterwards			0
the men who scored @entity4 ’s goals could also say the same			1
video new signings excellent - @entity28			2
