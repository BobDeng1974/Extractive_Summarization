the government 's handling of the inquiry into historic child abuse face fresh criticism today after its second chairman who was forced to resign was made a dame			1
@entity7 quit the probe in october after failing to declare the extent of her links to @entity13 peer @entity11 , who was allegedly handed a dossier detailing abuse			1
but today @entity16 - the first chairman to be appointed before resigning - said criticism of the honour awarded to dame @entity7 was ' very unfair ' as the damehood was in recognition of her term as lord mayor of @entity23			1
@entity7 ( pictured ) becomes a dame two months after being forced to resign as chairman of the government 's child abuse inquiry the decision to hand @entity7 a gong so soon after the abuse inquiry fiasco will be contentious with abuse survivors who campaigned to have her thrown off the committee			1
critics may suspect the honour was a sop to compensate her for losing the job			0
sir @entity39 , head of the @entity40 , said : ' her honour reflects what she has achieved throughout her career			0
' @entity46 mp @entity45 , who exposed the @entity48 child sex scandal , said the damehood ' seems inappropriate ' , adding : ' i can think of many more worthy recipients â€¦ once again it looks like the @entity53 are looking after their own			0
' he added : ' the public will be disappointed that people such as @entity7 are receiving honours when there are people who are much more worthy of an honour , people who have done courageous things , or have achieved things for their country			2
' i 'm sure her achievements warrant an honour but the timing is a bit off			0
i suspect some people might be upset and it might have been more appropriate to let a bit of time elapse			0
' however , @entity16 today leapt to her defence , blaming the @entity74 for failing to perform proper checks on @entity7 's links to former home secretary @entity11			1
@entity16 , who stood down from her role on the troubled inquiry in july because her brother , sir @entity79 , was attorney general in the 1980s , was speaking on the @entity81 4 today programme in her role as guest editor			2
defending the decision to award the honour , she said : ' she was lord mayor of @entity23 , she is only the second woman ever to be lord mayor of @entity23			1
' the very least that the honours system could do would be to honour a woman who has got such a distinguished post			0
' unfortunately she had , like myself , a brief period where she had agreed - for goodness sake , she had agreed to do a very disagreeable job to become chairman			0
' and because she happened to know @entity11 , she was unacceptable to the survivors and therefore she stood down			2
' @entity16 today leapt to @entity7 's defence , blaming the @entity74 for failing to perform proper checks on @entity7 's links to former home secretary @entity11 she criticised officials for failing to spot the potential difficulties the contacts with @entity11 could cause			1
' i do n't know what happened			0
there was discussion between her and , presumably , the @entity74			2
' i think they made a mistake in not doing sufficient due diligence , actually			0
' but the fact is she is a very distinguished woman , she did a wonderful year 's job as lord mayor and of course she gets an honour for it , that 's why she gets it			1
after @entity7 was appointed to the role , it emerged she had close links to @entity11 , who is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry ' to put if off to another time would be a reflection on the @entity127			1
' @entity128 - born @entity7 , a @entity127 lawyer already honoured with a @entity129 in 2001 , was made a @entity7 for services to the legal profession , diversity and the @entity127 in the @entity133			0
but @entity45 , @entity46 mp for @entity135 and a leading figure campaigning against child abuse cover - ups , was scathing about the honour			1
he said : ' @entity7 misled the home secretary over her links with @entity11 , caused unnecessary distress to victims of child abuse and caused a lengthy and avoidable delay to a very serious inquiry that urgently needs to get started			1
' it seems inappropriate that she 's now being invited to @entity147 to pick up one of the highest honours			0
' i can think of many more worthy recipients of this honour , but once again it looks like the @entity53 is looking after their own			0
' dame @entity7 's links to @entity11 prompted the calls for her resignation			2
lord @entity11 is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry over a dossier he received from mp @entity161 in 1983 , documenting the alleged involvement of vip figures in a child sex ring			2
