by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:43 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 04:40 est , 5 march 2014 @entity3 risked a row with the @entity5 last night after ignoring calls to help middle - class voters hit by the 40p tax rate			1
in a major speech on the economy , the prime minister promised that further savings from public spending would be used to fund tax cuts			1
but mr @entity3 , who confirmed the government would accept a rise in the minimum wage to £ 6.50 an hour , appeared to indicate that any future tax cuts would be targeted at the low - paid			1
ignored : @entity3 , pictured addressing the economy and apprenticeships , did not mention the tax he made no reference to raising the starting point for paying 40p tax , which is emerging as a key budget demand among conservative mps			1
senior @entity27 are pushing for the tax threshold to be raised from £ 41,450 to £ 44,000 to ease the pain on higher earners			2
@entity31 , a member of the @entity32 , last night urged the prime minister to ensure that any tax cuts are shared by middle - class voters as well as the low - paid			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ we need to do something about the 40p tax rate as well			1
people on £ 42,000 can not be described as wealthy , particularly if they are trying to bring up a family in the @entity41			0
we need to help these strivers , who are doing the right thing , to get on			0
‘ the current threshold sends out a bizarre message			0
if you earn £ 42,000 you start paying 40 per cent tax , but you have to earn £ 35,000 to earn the equivalent of the government ’s benefits cap			2
that gap is far too narrow			0
’ in may 2010 , the month that the @entity54 was formed , a worker became a higher rate taxpayer when their salary hit £ 43,875			2
but chancellor @entity60 has repeatedly lowered , or frozen , the level at which a worker starts to pay tax at 40 per cent			2
today you are a higher rate taxpayer if you are paid £ 41,450			1
the ‘ starting salary ’ will barely rise for the next two years , increasing by just 1 per cent a year to £ 41,865 in april this year and £ 42,285 in april 2015 , according to the government ’s figures			0
traditionally , it would have been increased at a far more generous rate , rising in line with inflation , but the chancellor scrapped this plan			2
accountants @entity73 estimate that this so - called ‘ fiscal drag ’ will see 4.6million people paying 40p tax by the time of next year ’s general election , up from 3million in 2010			1
@entity80 , the firm ’s senior tax partner , warned : ‘ it is no longer only the rich who are drawn into paying higher rate tax			1
’ he said recent tax changes have been ‘ too harsh on the squeezed middle ’ , catching people who do not consider themselves well - off , such as teachers , senior nurses and middle managers			1
mr @entity3 , who has made clear his desire to cut taxes if the @entity94 win power outright in 2015 , yesterday said that security came from ‘ having more money in our pockets ’			2
but @entity100 accused the prime minister of having a ‘ brass neck ’ by posing as a champion of tax cuts			1
the deputy prime minister claimed that the @entity27 had initially opposed @entity54 plans to raise the starting threshold for paying tax to £ 10,000			0
but mr @entity3 also used his speech in @entity109 to attack @entity111 ’s economic plans , warning that more borrowing would leave the next generation ‘ crippled with our debt ’			0
not convinced : @entity100 accused the prime minister of having a ' brass neck ' by posing as a tax cut champion he also took a swipe at both @entity111 and church leaders who have criticised the government ’s welfare reforms , saying ministers had a duty to tackle the ‘ failure ’ of the welfare state that left five million people on out - of - work benefits at the height of the boom in the last decade			1
‘ i do n’t care whether you are the leader of the @entity111 or the leader of the church , this kind of failure is just wrong , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s wrong to let our own people do nothing , with no purpose in their lives , dependent on benefits			0
‘ it ’s wrong to let our own people do nothing , with no purpose in their lives , dependent on benefits			0
it ’s wrong that we open our doors and communities to such rapid levels that they ca n’t manage			0
‘ and wrong that we ask @entity151 taxpayers to fund this situation with their hard - earned money			0
