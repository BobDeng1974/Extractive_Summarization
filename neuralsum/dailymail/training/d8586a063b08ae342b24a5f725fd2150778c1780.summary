the house has a round door , wooden *shingles* and an ivy - covered roof , but tucked away inside are all the modern conveniences of a larger home
a full kitchen , dining table , washer and dryer , sofa and flat - screen tv are found in the living area
through sliding doors there is a full bathroom and separate bedroom which has a twin - bed that *converts* into a queen - sized bed
a water heater , central heating and air - conditioning are also included
