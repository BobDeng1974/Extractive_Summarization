by @entity0 an airline which was named @entity2 ’s most hated is offering 8,000 free air miles to passengers – who moan about it on social media			1
ultra-low budget @entity2 carrier @entity7 has launched a campaign called @entity10 , where it rewards travellers who have had a bad experience on board one of its flights – or its competitors ’			1
whether it ’s frustrations about carry - on luggage charges , expensive food costs or pre-assigned seating , @entity7 is urging customers to vent their anger in 140 characters on @entity23			1
new campaign : spirit 's new website encourages passengers to moan about the airline online in return , they ’ll be handed 8,000 free air miles – almost enough for a one - way trip with the airline , which has received more complaints than any other domestic carrier for five years in a row			1
as ever , there ’s a catch – with passengers needing 10,000 total miles to secure a free flight , or flyers can sign up for the airline ’s credit card to be able to book 2,500 - mile one - way fares			1
to launch the campaign , @entity7 , which has long come under fire from disgruntled passengers over extra charges , has set up a website called @entity50 , which includes a humorous video about the initiative			1
the site says : ‘ @entity7 mess up – but at least @entity7 is willing to admit it			2
‘ we have n’t been great about telling you how we fly			0
we want to be better			0
‘ first , let ’s clear the air			0
hate on us – or any airline of your choosing – and we ’ll send you 8,000 free spirit miles			2
‘ you ’ll be well on your way to earning an award flight with us			0
high complaints : spirit topped the chart for grievances over the past five years we think that once you understand how we fly - how our total price is , on average , 40 % * lower than other airlines - you just might learn to love us			0
’ in april , @entity74 reported every year from 2009 - 2013 , passengers were three times as likely to have an issue with spirit than they were the second - place airline			2
the figures were calculated based on complaints - from flights and fares , to baggage and refunds – per 100,000 passengers			0
chart - topper : more complaints have been made about @entity7 than any other carrier in the @entity2 in fact , @entity7 received so many complaints , according to the the @entity2 @entity92 report , it had to be excluded from deeper analysis of on - time performance , baggage mishandling , and other issues			1
the airline also has its own ‘ boycott spirit ’ @entity100 page , and a @entity23 handle called @ hatespiritair			0
the report , which analysed consumer complaints filed with the @entity103 , said of spirit : ' two checked bags , basic meals and snacks , carry - ons , and , often , in - flight entertainment were formerly included in the price of your ticket , but now add - on fees for each of these newly a la carte items can easily add $ 100 or more to the cost of a one - way ticket			0
