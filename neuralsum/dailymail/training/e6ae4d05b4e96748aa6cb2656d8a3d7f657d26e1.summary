his villainous arch - enemies may have tried to kill him off many times , but he always escaped to live another day			0
now , 60 years after @entity3 of the @entity4 was introduced to the world in @entity8 ’s superb thriller @entity6 , he has been given yet another incarnation			1
this morning sees the publication of @entity12 , a new @entity14 novel written by the @entity16 - born novelist @entity15 , the seventh author to have tried to bring @entity8 ’s spy back to life			1
but what is so extraordinary is that 61 - year - old @entity15 ’s attempt is the first to have succeeded			2
back to his best : @entity22 praises @entity15 's new book @entity12 as a return to form for @entity14 ( portrayed here by @entity26 ) after a string of ' second - raters ' in the 007 series it is not as if those who have previously recreated @entity8 ’s hero have been second - raters			1
the great sir @entity33 tried his hand			0
so did top @entity36 thriller writer @entity35 , as well as one of our most brilliant novelists , @entity37			0
but all of them failed in one way or another			0
@entity33 was too much of a fan , so his descriptions of @entity3 were gushing and too detailed			2
@entity35 lacked the quintessential englishness and lightness of touch to make 007 leap off the page			0
@entity37 , meanwhile , was too sensitive a writer for the macho world of @entity3			2
in truth , producing a @entity14 sequel is one of the most daunting tasks any writer could ever undertake			0
@entity8 was a master craftsman who lived and breathed the world of @entity3 , and he was of a very different age			1
@entity15 launched his @entity14 novel in @entity62 on wednesday , following in the footsteps of six other authors who have tried to bring @entity8 's iconic character back to life in print a former naval intelligence officer and journalist , and the @entity71 - educated son of a @entity73 mp , @entity8 died of heavy smoking and heavier drinking in 1964 , four years before the current screen @entity3 , @entity26 , was even born			1
with his licence to kill , 007 became one of the true @entity80 icons not only of the @entity81 , but of all time — despite , or perhaps because of , the fact he was so politically incorrect , so shamelessly attracted to beautiful women and so insistent on his endless martinis ( shaken , not stirred )			2
but @entity15 brings back the real @entity3 , triumphantly			1
his first masterstroke was to set his story in 1969 , giving @entity3 an age of 45 , and allowing himself a rich palette of history and emotions to work with , for @entity3 was born in 1924 and served in the d - day landings in 1944 as a young lieutenant in @entity94			1
flying high : the new @entity3 novel @entity12 was jetted to seven countries around the @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103 - ahead of its release on thursday @entity15 cleverly pays tribute to @entity8 by setting the story in an age when the spying game was full of flamboyance and style , and before @entity111 and his fictional @entity80 spy @entity112 made the world of espionage so comparatively grey and murky			1
in his new novel , @entity15 gives @entity3 the task of single - handedly stopping a bitter and tribal civil war in the fictional oil - rich @entity119 state of @entity121			1
this reflects the author ’s own long - term fascination with that continent , which is clear for all to see in his first novel , @entity126 , published in 1981			0
the civil war does come to an end , but not so much as a result of @entity3 as the stain of political corruption that seeps through @entity15 ’s dark story			1
@entity15 is not afraid to make @entity3 as politically incorrect as @entity8 created him			1
he remembers that 007 made his first appearance as a hard - smoking gambler getting up from the roulette table in a @entity136 casino , a ruthless man who liked nothing more than to take a risk and trust his luck			1
the @entity14 in @entity12 harks back to the hard - drinking , heavy - smoking spy @entity8 ( pictured ) first introduced to readers in 1953 's @entity6 nor does he shy away from @entity3 ’s ruthless streak			1
after all , @entity8 described @entity3 in the very first chapter of @entity6 as a man unafraid of violence , whose features ‘ relapsed into a taciturn mask , ironical , brutal , and cold ’ as he fell asleep with his hand resting on the butt of a ‘ .38 @entity151 revolver with a sawn barrel ’ beneath his pillow			1
intent on revenge for what went on in @entity121 in his new novel , @entity15 ’s @entity3 is every bit as calculating			1
he goes shopping for guns in @entity160 and buys himself not only a @entity161 — ‘ third series with the smaller sights ’ — which takes eight rounds of ‘ @entity166 ’ bullets , but also a ‘ @entity170 and @entity171 ’ assault rifle complete with ‘ single shot , bolt action			0
point five zero calibre bullet ’			0
@entity15 is equally robust when it comes to women			0
he clearly remembers that when @entity8 ’s @entity3 first meets the delectable @entity175 in @entity6 , 007 noticed that ‘ her medium - length dress was of grey soie sauvage with a square - cut bodice , lasciviously tight across her fine breasts ’			1
in @entity12 , @entity15 ’s @entity3 first encounters the heroine @entity180 in the @entity182 hotel , @entity62 : ‘ the zip on the front of her outfit — her catsuit — was like a provocation , a challenge , crying out to be pulled down , ’ writes @entity15			1
‘ @entity3 smiled to himself as he imagined doing precisely that and drank more coffee — there was life in the old dog yet ’			0
these may not be politically correct thoughts , but they are an authentic part of the personality of @entity8 ’s @entity14 , a man driven by a fierce desire to take revenge for the treachery that always seems to surround him			1
treachery is one of @entity8 ’s favourite themes — and one which @entity15 returns to in @entity12			1
the familiar figures of @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 — who is younger , but equally eccentric — appear but @entity15 also takes care to pay homage to @entity8 ’s villains and their vicious assistants			2
he has created a mysterious multi-millionaire , @entity214 , who may be @entity215 , @entity216 or @entity217			0
@entity214 relies on the help of the brutal @entity219 , who trained with the @entity220 in @entity221 in 1966			0
@entity35 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) have both published books in the @entity14 series both are as unscrupulous and psychopathic as @entity8 ’s dr @entity226 , @entity227 or @entity228 , not to mention @entity229 , @entity230 or @entity231 , and — like every great fictional villain — contrive to make the story itself stronger , and the suspense even greater			2
in @entity12 , @entity15 even leaves open the possibility that the horrifying @entity219 may have survived to haunt him in the future			2
to bring a much - loved character back to life in this way is a formidable literary achievement			0
it takes a deep understanding of the original character			0
it means adapting that character for our modern , politically - correct age but at the same time retaining its essential personality : the way @entity251 shamelessly eyes up women , harks back to a chauvinist @entity254 class system , and smokes and drinks as if such vices were going out of fashion — remains utterly credible			0
it also requires an ability to mix homage to another author with your own creative voice , and many writers find this balancing act incredibly difficult			0
swinging ' 60s : solo is set in the 1960s , the same era @entity268 ( pictured ) first brought the secret agent to life on the big screen who , for example , would want to be in crime writer @entity277 ’s shoes ? she has just agreed to write a new @entity279 story based on @entity282 ’s @entity281 detective , who died in the novel curtain , published in 1975			0
will she chose to bring him back to life ? will she bring him up to date ? these are momentous decisions she has to make			0
@entity15 ’s decision to place his @entity3 firmly in 1969 , with references to contemporary films , ‘ @entity289 ’ haircuts and flared jeans , finds 007 in a world in which he is not so much out of place as just slightly old - fashioned , with his love of @entity297 suits and hand - made cigarettes			1
@entity15 ’s achievement in matching @entity8 is all the more remarkable because it reminds us vividly how fine a writer @entity8 was			2
@entity303 was a tremendous fan ; @entity304 insisted that he had ‘ discovered the secret of narrative art			0
the reader has to go on reading ; and one magazine called him a ‘ kind of supersonic @entity312 ’ while another added that he was ‘ the best new thriller writer since ( @entity305 ’			0
more than 100 million @entity3 books have been sold in the past six decades , and @entity15 ’s new one will add considerably to that total , for he has kept the legend alive while not tarnishing it , nor diminishing it for a single moment			2
@entity3 is most certainly back between hard covers , with a vengeance .			2

@entity15 's new book @entity12 features a heavy - smoking , hard - drinking @entity14 set in the @entity81
the author ' triumphantly ' brings back ' the real @entity3 '
@entity15 is the seventh author to tackle 007 since @entity8 's death in 1964
