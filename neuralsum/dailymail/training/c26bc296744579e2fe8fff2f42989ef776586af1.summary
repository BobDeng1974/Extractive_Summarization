for someone who became famous as a right - to - die campaigner , @entity0 enjoyed life as much as anyone i have ever met			1
despite having the most severe type of @entity7 , her quick , self - deprecating sense of humour , her deep love of music and fierce pride in her appearance never left her			2
that ’s why the manner of her death last week , at the age of 51 , is so distressing			1
instead of being allowed to die painlessly and with the dignity she ’d fought so hard for , @entity21 — who i ’d come to know after interviewing her five years ago — was forced to starve herself to death , very slowly and very unpleasantly , in a @entity26 hospice			1
it ’s an end none of us wants			0
who would honestly wish to die in this way when it ’s perfectly possible to slip away in your own bed , pain - free and surrounded by your loved ones ? that ’s why i , like her , want the law changed to allow assisted dying in this country			1
i know it ’s a controversial view and no one was more shocked than i to read in this paper yesterday of the situation in @entity53 , where people who are not terminally ill are helped to die by medics			2
but that does not mean a better thought - out law in this country would not benefit us all			1
ours is a country where we let vets put dying animals down , but insist that people carry on living in agony and suffer the death of nightmares			2
right - to - die campaigner and multiple sclerosis sufferer @entity0 ( pictured ) died earlier this week this is something i find particularly frightening			1
just like @entity21 , i have @entity7 ( @entity69 ) , a neurological condition that can cause anything from blurred vision and slurred speech to blindness and paralysis			1
i know full well the horror of receiving the initial diagnosis and the constant worry that your symptoms might be worsening			0
i have felt the cold hand of fear that grips you when you think about the future , about death			0
how you pray you ’re one of the lucky ones			0
how you hope against hope you do n’t die like @entity21			2
surely in this day and age , no one should have to go through that ? i first met @entity21 in 2009 after i ’d interviewed her for the @entity92 ’s magazine about her legal battle to clarify the law on whether a person would be prosecuted for helping a loved one take their own life abroad			1
ms @entity28 said she was given her diagnosis by an unsympathetic doctor and sent off to deal with it alone , pictured with her partner @entity101 she invited me to the @entity102 in @entity103 to see her husband , @entity105 violinist @entity104 , play			1
she greeted me warmly , throwing her arms around me with a beaming smile — you ’d never have known she was in constant pain and losing the strength in her arms			0
i remember watching her as she danced in her wheelchair , losing herself in the music , clearly proud of her talented husband			0
i ’d been diagnosed 12 years earlier , at the age of 25 , after having vision problems and losing both sensation in and control of my legs , which made me fall over like a rag doll			1
after months of tests and scans , i was given the news by a rather unsympathetic doctor and sent off to deal with it alone			1
like most newly diagnosed people , the diagnosis left me reeling and i feared the worst			2
although @entity69 is a highly individual disease — and rarely a fatal one ( most people die of other causes ) — no one knows how their condition will progress , so it inevitably makes you confront your own mortality			1
i knew from the start that if the day ever came when i knew only suffering and dependency , and had no quality of life , i would n’t want to go on living			0
thankfully , unlike @entity21 , who had the most disabling , progressive form of the disease , i now know that i have a more benign type			0
as the years have passed , leaving me still able - bodied and relatively well with only mild sensory symptoms such as numbness and tingling , i know i have been incredibly fortunate			2
but i also know that the majority of people with @entity69 do eventually get worse , and that my future remains uncertain			1
since my diagnosis , i ’ve watched many friends steadily become disabled and dependent on others			0
and i ’ve known a few who have reached the final stages of ms. believe me , this is not a pleasant prospect			0
in ‘ end stage ’ @entity69 , you become bedridden , paralysed , in pain , incontinent , unable to speak and swallow , blind and deaf , and possibly demented , too			1
however good my palliative care might be , i would n’t want to end up like this , or to become a burden on my loved ones			0
and , like @entity21 , i would n’t want my partner , @entity101 , to face prison for helping me to die			2
he ’s known about my condition since we met — i ’m very open about it — and he ’s taken it in his stride , but it ’s impossible to predict how he might cope if i were suddenly to deteriorate			2
like @entity21 , i ’ve always believed that how and when you die should be your personal choice			2
yes , i think life is precious , but only those faced with a ghastly death can know how important the manner of your passing actually is			0
ms @entity0 , pictured with her husband @entity104 , was forced to starve herself to death , very slowly and very unpleasantly , in a @entity26 hospice for me , the crux of the issue is being able to take charge of my destiny			1
if i were ever to lose the ability to control my bodily functions , to feed or dress myself , or even to eat without assistance , the one thing left to me should be the ability to choose the timing and manner of my death			2
why should n’t a medic be able to help me do this ? i ’m not saying that everyone with end - stage @entity69 or cancer or any other condition should be euthanised , just that assisted death should be an option for them			1
it ’s not for a judge or a doctor or a relative to decide , it ’s up to the individual : a way out if you need or want it			0
i do n’t think it ’s too much to ask , after all , we ’re already allowed to refuse life - saving medical treatment — for example , a @entity211 may turn down a blood transfusion — or ask not to be resuscitated , so why ca n’t we ask for help in dying too ? @entity21 tried her hardest to win this concession for us			1
but even though five @entity215 ruled in her favour and insisted the @entity217 must clarify the law on assisted dying , those new legal guidelines , while suggesting prosecution was not likely , did n’t guarantee it			1
helping someone die abroad is still illegal			0
i can understand the point of view of @entity21 ’s opponents , particularly that allowing assisted suicide would put severely ill or disabled people in mortal danger — giving greedy , exhausted or selfish relatives the opportunity to bump them off at will			0
but , a carefully constructed law would ensure only a sick person who is judged to be mentally capable could ask for help to die			1
someone like @entity21 was mentally capable of knowing how she wanted to end her life , but in the end the only choice she could make was to enter a hospice and starve herself			0
she was too weak to take an overdose or kill herself in another less painful way			0
the problem with the law as it stands is that you are allowed to make the agonising choice to refuse food , but you ca n’t ask for a painless injection			0
and the irony is that with no adjustments to the law on assisted dying , people will continue to kill themselves when they are n’t yet ready to die , when they still have quality of life , because the alternative is too horrific to imagine			1
former university lecturer @entity255 , 48 , from @entity256 , @entity257 , who also had @entity69 , took her own life five years ago using helium gas she ’d bought on the internet			1
her friends say that if assisted suicide had been legal , she ’d have chosen to continue living but , aware that no doctor could help her die when her suffering got too much , she took her own life while she was still physically capable of doing so			2
being able to enjoy her life — and wanting to help others do the same — was what motivated @entity0			2
she ’d been diagnosed with @entity69 — the most severe form — in 1995 , soon after meeting @entity104			1
he stuck by her and they married in 1998 , but her condition rapidly deteriorated and within three years of their wedding , she was wheelchair - bound			0
if it had n’t been for the case of @entity275 , the @entity277 sufferer who lost a similar court battle , @entity21 might have remained in obscurity			2
but when @entity275 choked to death in 2002 — the very death she ’d most feared — @entity21 realised she did n’t want to end up that way ( although @entity69 is n’t a terminal illness , many of its symptoms , such as choking , are life - threatening ) and so mounted her legal campaign			1
like most people , i prefer to believe i will die peacefully in my sleep			0
but , in my darkest hours , i imagine how horrific it would be to die — helpless and paralysed — from choking			0
i ’m not sure i ’d be brave enough to face the torture of starving myself to death , like @entity21 , or that i ’ll have the means or resources to take myself to @entity295			0
so i hope that for my sake , and for yours — i ’m not just talking about @entity69 here — that the law will change soon			1
meanwhile , i shall continue to celebrate the life of @entity21 by remembering the way she could make me laugh out loud about the even most serious of subjects			0
‘ because i can no longer feel my legs , having them waxed is now completely painless ! ’ she ’d joke			0
i ’ll close my eyes and see her dancing in her wheelchair with a big grin on her face and her eyes full of life .			0
