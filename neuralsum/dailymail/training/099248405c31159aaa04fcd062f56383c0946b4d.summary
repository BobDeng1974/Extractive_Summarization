by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 16 september 2013 @entity1 brought back many souvenirs from her eight months teaching @entity3 in @entity4 - including one that was unexpected and unwelcome			1
within a week of returning home in june she suffered fatigue , loss of appetite , weight loss and a cough when she bent over			2
her gp initially suspected a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics , but the symptoms did not clear up and when , two weeks after getting back , @entity1 developed breathlessness , a severe ache in her upper back and night sweats , she returned to her doctor			1
unwelcome souvenir : @entity1 caught @entity25 whilst teaching in @entity4 he sent her straight to hospital for an x-ray , which revealed the area between her left lung and her ribcage was about two - thirds full of liquid			1
while we all naturally have some fluid - a few spoonfuls - here to lubricate the lungs , @entity1 had two - and - a - half litres drained during a week - long stay in hospital ( the fluid had been compressing her lung , causing the discomfort and cough )			1
doctors suspected pneumonia , and she was prescribed more antibiotics , and warned it might take her weeks to recover			2
as a precaution , they ran other tests , and six weeks after becoming ill @entity1 was shocked to learn she had @entity25			2
' the doctors are almost certain i caught it while i was in @entity4 , ' says @entity1 , 34 , from @entity53 in @entity54			2
like most teenagers in the @entity56 and @entity57 , she had been given the @entity58 vaccine ( @entity58 ) against @entity25 when she was 13 , and assumed she was protected			2
@entity25 is spread by inhaling tiny droplets from coughs or sneezes of an infected person			2
most common in @entity63 and @entity64 , it 's one of several diseases still prevalent in far - flung destinations			1
the concern is that with tropical travel now viewed as routine - whether for a two - week holiday or a longer period , such as a gap year - it 's easy to forget that many of these unpleasant and even deadly diseases still pose a serious risk			1
false sense of security : @entity1 , like many people , thought her jabs would protect her and while you might think you 're covered by a jab , as @entity1 did , there are many cases when protection is limited at best			1
' jabs give people a false sense of security when they travel because they do n't provide 100 per cent protection , ' says dr @entity91 , of the @entity92 at the @entity93			1
although childhood vaccinations give good protection for life , people should always be cautious when it comes to what they eat and drink , adds dr @entity99 , consultant immunologist at @entity100			1
' it also depends where you travel , ' she says			1
' some vaccines , such as typhoid , only protect against one strain of two , and even then have varying efficacy depending where you are and the resistance of the strains there			2
' one study in @entity113 showed the efficacy of the typhoid jab was 75 per cent , while in @entity116 it was only 55 per cent			0
' another problem for many affected travellers is that the symptoms do n't manifest themselves until they 're back in the @entity120			1
this can be because the disease only becomes active when your immune system is low , or because the incubation period means you may not see symptoms for days or weeks after infection			1
the downside of getting ill once back in the @entity120 is that diagnosis and treatment is likely to be slower because doctors here are not used to dealing with such diseases			1
' my sheets would be drenched in sweat in the morning			0
i also felt exhausted and my body ached enormously			0
it was as if i could feel every internal organ aching			0
' @entity142 , 30 , from @entity143 , is all too well aware of these problems			0
despite being vaccinated against typhoid - as advised by the @entity148 - when she went back - packing in @entity145 for five weeks with her husband in 2011 , she still contracted the disease			1
highly contagious , the typhoid bacterium is spread through food - often poultry - and less commonly water contaminated by faeces from an infected person			1
' i began to feel ill on the way home - washed out and hot , ' recalls @entity142			1
' but i put it down to the long flight			0
the fever came and went after i got home , but i felt well enough to go to @entity159 for a few days after coming back			1
' but while in @entity159 , @entity142 's symptoms worsened			1
her temperature shot up at night : ' my sheets would be drenched in sweat in the morning			0
i also felt exhausted and my body ached enormously			0
it was as if i could feel every internal organ aching			0
' @entity142 came back early and saw her gp , who could n't diagnose the problem but said to go to hospital if her symptoms worsened			1
for the next week her condition fluctuated , but when her temperature hit 105f ( 40.5c ) , her husband took her to @entity175 immediately			0
' at this point i was starting to hallucinate , ' she says			0
' every time i closed my eyes i was convinced i could hear a band drumming			0
at one point the light switches seemed to be dripping from the walls			0
i also totally lost my balance			0
' @entity142 was placed in an isolation ward for infectious diseases and finally diagnosed with typhoid a few days later			1
' it was n't something i expected , especially considering i 'd been vaccinated , ' she says			1
after a week in hospital @entity142 was discharged , but five days later her condition deteriorated			0
after a second stint in hospital , on stronger antibiotics , she was allowed home again			0
but her recovery was painfully slow			0
she had extreme fatigue and it was eight months before she was anywhere near better			0
dr @entity91 points out the typhoid vaccination is only about 60 per cent effective for those who live in countries where typhoid is prevalent , and likely to be much less for tourists who 've never been exposed to the bugs			1
promising start : @entity1 pictured with students at the school she taught at in @entity4 ' i do n't believe the vaccine actually works in tourists , ' he says			1
' the only studies that have been done are on people who live in these countries and they will have a certain amount of natural immunity , so you ca n't say that it worked for them so it will work for someone who 's never seen the bug			1
' the problem is also diagnosing such illnesses when most @entity120 doctors have very little , if no , clinical experience in them			1
as dr @entity91 explains : ' while @entity25 is a little more common ( there are 9,000 cases annually in the @entity120 ) - especially in parts of @entity143 , a @entity120 doctor may see a case of typhoid once in their career , if at all			1
it 's very important that if you get ill after coming home from travelling , you say where you 've been , especially as some illnesses may not display symptoms until weeks later			1
' @entity1 and @entity142 both told their doctors where they had been			0
dr @entity91 adds : ' flu , pneumonia and @entity25 have symptoms common to each other so are easily misdiagnosed			1
the implications can be very serious			0
' artist @entity243 learned this the hard way			0
the 44 - year - old from @entity247 , @entity248 , contracted dengue fever while visiting @entity250 in the summer of 2009			2
a common , but sometimes fatal , viral infection found in tropical regions , dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes - there is currently no vaccine ( though one is in development ) and no cure			1
@entity243 had been bitten twice by mosquitoes the day before she flew home from @entity250			0
' i got ill within a few days of arriving back , but it took doctors three weeks to diagnose me			2
people are always terrified about going to hospitals abroad , but if i 'd been ill in @entity250 , i 'm sure dengue would have been diagnosed sooner because it 's so much more common there , ' she says			0
although she mentioned where she had been on holiday to her doctor , she was initially told she had flu			0
her symptoms started with vomiting , diarrhoea , and mild lung and urine infections			2
' after a few days i could n't lift my head off the pillow , ' she says			2
because her return home in 2009 coincided with an outbreak of swine flu , doctors assumed this was what she had			0
' but then i started bleeding , like a heavy period , and i was struggling to read - the type was blurry			2
' an eye specialist thought she might have type 2 diabetes , then friends suggested dengue fever			0
a blood test confirmed @entity243 had the potentially fatal haemorrhagic dengue fever , which kills by triggering internal bleeding - her blurred vision was caused by bleeding behind her eye			2
illness strikes : @entity1 in hospital , with her lung drain inserted ; @entity1 is finally on the mend after taking strong antibiotics for six months four years later , @entity243 still suffers from fatigue , while for @entity142 , catching typhoid has changed her outlook for ever			0
' it was very scary , but gave me a new respect for my body and made me fearless about life , ' she says			0
while previously an art expert for auction house @entity313 , she has now launched a business - poppy 's funerals - to provide a family - led funeral service			1
meanwhile , @entity1 is finally on the mend after taking strong antibiotics for six months			0
but while the past two - and - a - half months have been tough , she 's also had something to celebrate - she 's pregnant			2
thankfully she 's been told neither the @entity25 , nor her treatment , will affect her baby			2
due in december and conceived with her fiance in @entity322 , @entity4 , it will be a far happier reminder of her time there .			0

with tropical travel seen as routine , many forget diseases are still prevalent
jabs give a false sense of security - they do n't provide 100 *%* protection
many symptoms do n't manifest until travellers are back in the @entity120
@entity120 *gps* may not be familiar with such diseases so diagnosis and treatment is often slower
