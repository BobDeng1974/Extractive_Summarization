winds as powerful as those which caused misery last winter will sweep in tomorrow , forecasters have warned			2
the @entity5 issued official weather warnings for northern @entity7 and @entity8 , saying there may be power cuts , transport chaos and damage to homes and buildings			1
the most powerful winds of 80 to 90mph will be seen in @entity8 on friday and saturday , as the centres of two consecutive storms pass by the northern coast			1
in northern parts of @entity7 and @entity21 winds could reach 70mph , with gales of 50mph seen in the @entity23			1
it will bring winds of up to 90mph in northern @entity8 eerie skyline : fast - moving storm clouds over @entity37 in east @entity38 today			1
winds of up to 90mph are expected to hit @entity28 @entity40 : after a dull rainy day , a dog walker enjoys the view from @entity43 as the sun sets over @entity45 and @entity46 the @entity5 alert said : ‘ the public should be aware of potential for disruption to transport and power supplies and the possibility of structural damage			1
large waves may also lead to dangerous conditions along some coasts			0
’ at the same time , temperatures will be remarkably mild for this time of year , reaching @entity59 ( @entity60 ) in @entity38 – compared with the average january temperature of @entity62 ( @entity63 )			0
forecasters said the ferocious weather is being caused by an exceptionally strong jet stream triggered by cold conditions in the @entity68			1
@entity69 , chief meteorologist at the @entity5 , said : ‘ the jet stream effectively fuels low pressure systems moving across the @entity32 , causing them to deepen rapidly as they pass to the north of the @entity28			1
‘ this will bring some very strong winds across the @entity28 , but they will most likely be strongest in northern @entity8			1
’ @entity77 of the @entity5 said wind speeds would be similar to those seen in the fierce storms towards the end of 2013 , when tens of thousands of homes were left without power , trees were uprooted , trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the @entity28			2
but while the worst weather then was seen in southern @entity7 , this time rural parts of @entity8 will bear the brunt , mr @entity77 added			1
yellow weather warnings for the strong gales have been issued for much of @entity8 on friday ( left ) , when the first storm is due to hit , and for a wider area of the north and central @entity7 when the second jetstream is forecast to hit the country on saturday ( right ) @entity100 weather warnings have been issued for both friday and saturday			1
these are currently yellow - be prepared - warnings , but mr @entity69 said these could be changed as the storm is tracked			0
forecasters have not issued warnings for rain on thursday and friday , with heavy rain in the @entity107 on wednesday expected to end by thursday			2
the storms will also hit at a time when the @entity28 is seeing above average temperatures for this time of year - double what is normal in some areas			1
in the @entity115 the mercury is expected to reach @entity116 on friday and between @entity117 and @entity118 on saturday			2
this is more than double the average of @entity120 for this time in the region			0
in @entity38 , friday could see ' unseasonably warm ' temperatures recorded as the mercury is expected to reach @entity59			1
again , this is double the average of @entity125 expected at this time of year			0
however forecasters said it will not feel warm because of the strong winds battering much of the @entity28			1
the deep and strong jet stream is currently moving towards the @entity28 , with current winds of up to 250mph ( depicted by the white areas to left ) the first storm will hit the north of the @entity28 on friday and will be followed by a successor that will be even more wide ranging in the north the storms are similar to those experienced last winter in december and january , when high winds and downpours caused devastation in the @entity23			1
tens of thousands of homes were left without power , trees were uprooted , trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the @entity28			0
parts of the @entity152 were left submerged for weeks after the heavy downpours			0

and 14 - year - old @entity158 was swept out to sea when he played near waves in @entity161 , @entity162			0
however forecasters said this year 's storms are different because they will be more focused on the @entity115			0
this part of the country is more used to coping with extremes of weather and less heavily populated			0
there is also expected to be considerably less rain , which caused havoc in the @entity23 during last winter			0
wintry weather is forecast to start on thursday evening with strong winds hitting @entity8 and the @entity174 on friday morning			1
this is expected to move east on friday afternoon			0
but there will be little respite as by saturday afternoon a second system will move in , bringing stronger winds to a wider area of the north			2
@entity182 , a forecaster at the @entity5 , said : ' these are being caused by very deep low pressure back to back in some areas			0
' it will be more widespread than anything we 've seen so far this winter			0
' the cold weather in @entity68 is having an impact on the jet stream and is strengthening it			2
at the moment the jet stream is moving at about 230mph			2
' yellow weather warnings are in place for the whole of @entity8 and much of the north of the @entity28 for thursday and friday			1
the double storm warning comes as it was revealed that last year was the hottest ever for the @entity28 , with an average temperature of 9.9c			2
the previous record , set in 2006 , saw an average temperature of @entity203			0
the 2014 record means that eight of the @entity28 's top ten warmest years have happened since 2002			0
