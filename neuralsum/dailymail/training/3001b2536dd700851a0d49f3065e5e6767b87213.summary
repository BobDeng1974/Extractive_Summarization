by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 a week is a long time not only in politics but also in football			2
just as governments can be brought down in seven days , so the world game can be changed irrevocably in that brief time span			1
the carnival which has kicked off @entity8 2014 , in all its multi-coloured spectacle and dazzling excitement , has altered long - held perceptions about football in the minds of millions			1
dazzling excitement : the @entity14 in @entity8 has got off to the perfect start with plenty of goals and shocks carnival : the first week of the @entity14 has altered the perception of football in the minds of millions suddenly the @entity22 is no longer the zenith , nor the @entity25 or @entity26 the blinkered obsession			1
something far more profound and enchanting is happening here			0
something which is capturing the hearts of the world ’s population			0
it can be seen on the faces of the fans in the stadia as they exude a passion for their national teams which transcends the tribal support for club football			2
it is inspiring a a fraternity between peoples of nations who , eager though they are to win , are finding a bond with rival supporters which is rooted in their fascination with the game			1
quite simply , it means more			0
also to the players , many of whom are surpassing themselves as they respond to the hopes and exhortations of their public			0
emotional : @entity8 star @entity57 breaks down in tears during his country 's national anthem on monday there is nothing wrong with patriotism providing it is married to mutual respect			1
so even as many of the physical challenges have bordered on the brutal , still sportsmanship flourishes			0
the most vivid example of that came when @entity69 , the @entity8 who is probably the best centre - back in the world , lunged into a desperate assault on @entity74 ’s @entity73			1
@entity69 knew in his heart he had done wrong			0
he shook the hand of the referee who booked him , in contrition not irony			0
then he helped his victim back to his feet and could clearly be lip - read repeating to him ‘ desculpa			0
which @entity73 did , with an embrace			0
reaching for the stars : @entity87 points to the sky after scoring against @entity89 that exchange was as important in its way as the goal rush which has hall - marked a @entity14 imbued with the ambition to win , not crippled by fear of defeat			1
how pleasing it is to include @entity97 in that recognition			1
as @entity104 ’s team launch us into week two of this tournament they do so admired by all , even though they lost game one to @entity89			1
given a manager deeply schooled in international football , @entity97 have caught the spirit of @entity8			1
@entity104 sent them out to attack the @entity111 even though he was conscious of the risks and they were winners in the estimation of most who watched them despite being narrowly defeated			0
when @entity118 , the arch pragmatist , commends you for the manner of your losing then you must have done an awful lot right			0
now , in @entity123 against the @entity124 of @entity125 , @entity97 have a wonderful opportunity to justify all the praise			1
these @entity128 , with @entity125 watching from the bench in the last phase of his recovery from injury , were truly awful in their defeat by @entity135			2
this is @entity97 ’s chance to begin that rare process in @entity139 , qualifying after losing the opening match			1
that does not mean , however , that they should simply carry on where they left off against @entity89			1
@entity104 needs to make adjustments which can take maximum advantage of @entity124 ’s weaknesses in defence and midfield			0
he must also tighten up his own rear - guard against @entity125 and @entity151			0
there was a slight but critical imbalance in the team edged out by @entity89			1
with @entity155 played out of position on the left to help accommodate that trio of young forwards – @entity160 , @entity87 and @entity161 – @entity162 was able to control the game			2
that also exposed space behind attack - minded left back @entity166 which @entity167 cleverly exploited			0
ready to roar : @entity97 boss @entity104 may have to make some adjustments ahead of the @entity124 game shoring up the defence is not merely a matter of changing personnel in the back four , even though of the two @entity176 i personally would prefer @entity177 to @entity178			1
they need better protection by the midfield and one way of doing that would be to define captain @entity184 as purely the anchor there and bring back @entity187 to play in front of him , there to offer his experience to @entity160 and @entity191			2
with @entity155 and @entity87 up front , something like this 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 team would be more like it : @entity196 – @entity197 , @entity177 , @entity198 , @entity166 – @entity184 – @entity160 , @entity187 , @entity191 – @entity87 , @entity155			0
@entity104 can find now the template for a run at least as far as the quarter finals			0
and if that surprises many , well this @entity14 is full of surprises			2
most of them pleasant , including @entity213 and @entity214 leading the @entity216 demolition of @entity218 tiki - taka , the one surge of genius with which @entity206 dragged himself out of a trough and @entity208 to much - need victory over @entity210 , the brush strokes from @entity57 which suggests @entity8 are still just about favourites , @entity221 ’s clinical finishing which raises the prospect that @entity223 might become the first @entity225 winners of a @entity14 in the @entity226 … and all those goals			1
in with a shout : @entity206 roars with delight after scoring for @entity208 against @entity210 on sunday none of this happened in @entity232 four years ago			0
it needed football to come back to the spiritual home of the beautiful game			2
all the doubts about that decision by @entity239 have been swept away on a tidal wave of brilliance , with hardly a dull moment			0
a week a long time in politics ? the football has also given the @entity8 government a respite from the social unrest fuelled by poverty , deprivation and economic inequality			1
that first match of week one , played by @entity8 and @entity252 in @entity123 last thursday to a sound - track of protesters battling riot police in the streets , seems a very long time ago .			2

@entity8 2014 has been one of the most exciting @entity14 's in living *memory*
carnival *atmosphere* and exciting play has changed people 's perceptions of football
supporters of rival nations are bonding over love of the game
@entity97 team have won admirers for attacking play despite defeat to @entity89 in opening game
