by @entity0 muscle , tendons , skin and hair on a sharp obsidian knife from 2,000 years ago have proved that the stone weapon was used for human sacrifices			1
the forensic samples prove that brutal human sacrifices were being carried out in the region 1,000 years before the @entity11			1
@entity13 's @entity12 said the finding clearly corroborates accounts from later cultures about the use of sharp obsidian knives in sacrificing humans			2
researchers in @entity13 announced that they have found blood cells and fragments of muscle , tendon , skin and hair on 2,000 - year - old stone knives , calling it the first conclusive evidence from a large number of stone implements pointing to their use in human sacrifice human blood cells seen through an electronic microscope , found in sharp obsidian knives discovered in @entity37 , in the central @entity13 state of @entity39 the forensics show that the little - known ' @entity37 ' people were practicing human sacrifice 2,000 years ago - the region has a long history of the practice , also carried out by the @entity45 as depicted in @entity47 's @entity46 researchers in @entity13 called it the first conclusive evidence from a large number of stone implements pointing to their use in human sacrifice			1
other physical evidence such as cut marks on the bones of ancient human skeletons had previously offered indirect proof of the practice			0
researchers in @entity13 had noticed what they believed were fossilized blood stains on stone knives as long as 20 years ago			1
but the institute said it took a methodical examination using a scanning electron microscope to positively identify the human tissues on 31 knives from the @entity37 site in the central @entity13 state of @entity39			2
the collection of stone knives is from the little - known @entity37 culture , which flourished just after the mysterious city - state of @entity68			1
@entity37 preceded by more than 1,000 years the region 's most famous human sacrifice practitioners , the @entity11			1
the archaeologists who found the knives gave them to researcher @entity73 at the anthropology institute 's restoration laboratories about two years ago			0
with help from specialists at @entity13 's @entity78 , they were studied under the scanning electronic microscope and found to contain red blood cells , collagen , tendon and muscle fiber fragments			0
while historical accounts from @entity11 times , as well as drawings and paintings from earlier cultures , had long suggested that priests used knives and other instruments for non-life - threatening bloodletting rituals , the presence of the muscle and tendon traces indicates the cuts were deep and intended to sever portions of the victim 's body			2
‘ these finds confirm that the knives were used for sacrifices , ’ @entity73 said			0
a sharp obsidian knife found in @entity37 , in the central @entity13 state of @entity39 the acropolis or unit 11 , @entity108 city dated between 700 - 950 ad , @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity13			1
new evidence shows that the ' @entity37 ' people practiced human sacrifice @entity112 , associate professor of anthropology at the @entity114 who was not involved in the research project , said it was the first time to her knowledge that such tissue remains had been identified on obsidian knives			1
‘ this is a compelling demonstration that these knives were used to cut human flesh , ’ @entity112 said in an email			0
she said other studies have found trace elements of organic remains such as food on ancient artifacts , so ‘ with the right conditions such remains can preserve for long periods			0
’ @entity112 said human sacrifice practices either described by the @entity135 conquerors or depicted in @entity137 paintings include heart removal , decapitation , dismemberment , disemboweling and skinning of victims			0
interestingly , the find announced wednesday has already begun to shed some new light on the murky sacrifice practices of pre-hispanic cultures , which believed that human blood was a sort of vital liquid needed to keep the cosmos in balance			0
for example , some knives in the test had more traces of red blood cells , while others had more skin , and others more muscle or collagen , ‘ which suggest that each cutting tool was used for a different purpose , according to its form , ’ @entity73 said			0
@entity112 said the find also suggested the intriguing possibility that the sacrificial knives were ritually deposited , unwashed , in some special site after being used			0
the @entity135 conquerors have long been suspected of perhaps exaggerating accounts of mass human sacrifice in pre-hispanic cultures , to make their @entity173 subjects appear more brutal and less deserving of sympathy			1
‘ the archaeological confirmation of human sacrifice is important both for supporting or contesting the many post-conquest historical accounts and pre-conquest imagery of sacrifice , ’ @entity112 wrote .			2
