vice president @entity2 will meet with senior representatives of @entity5 countries this week to ' emphasize that illegal immigration is not safe ' and clear up ' misconceptions ' about the @entity9 's policy on child immigration , a senior @entity1 official said sunday			1
the senior official told reporters on a conference call that a visit to @entity15 had been added to @entity2 's schedule at the last minute so he could meet with representatives of the governments of @entity15 , @entity19 and @entity20 to discuss the ' root causes ' behind the apparent flood of unaccompanied minors leaving their countries to illegally immigrate to the @entity9 @entity2 's sudden visit to @entity15 is the @entity28 administration 's latest effort to mitigate criticism that it encouraged thousands of children and teenagers to make the dangerous trek to the @entity9 when it announced two years ago that it would stop deporting children of illegal immigrants			1
flood : @entity36 , the executive director of the @entity37 compared the situation to the displacement of people following @entity41 sickness : thousands of children have been transported to @entity44 , @entity45 , and have reportedly become sickened by the food they have been given at the shelter @entity48 faces : the pictures , taken recently , show just how many of the illegal immigrants are children -- many of whom have no supervising adult			2
up to 400 a day are pouring over the border the vice president , however , has attracted his own share of eye - rolls with recent comments about immigration			2
on june 10 he told an audience at the @entity62 that the @entity9 economy needs a ' constant , unrelenting stream ' of immigrants to continue coming across the border			1
' not dribbling , ' he insisted			0
' @entity28 's 2012 policy shift was n't meant to apply to the children now crossing the border illegally			1
but 33,000 unaccompanied minors have made the hazardous trip from @entity74 to @entity75 since october , thinking they would be able to stay in the @entity9 once they arrived			0
' we are seeing hundreds turning themselves in daily			0
and i mean hundreds at a time , ' @entity79 , a chapter leader of the @entity80 , told @entity82 last week			1
' they know that once they get to the station , we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the @entity9 , ' he said			0
the @entity89 says the @entity28 administration estimates that roughly 80,000 illegal immigrant children will seek safe haven in the @entity9 this year			0
twelve times as many kids are coming north illegally this year as the year before president @entity28 instituted the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) program			0
cheek - by - jowl : the immigrants are crammed in tiny rooms and forced to sleep on the floor with aluminium blankets as their only comfort conspiracy : an association of former border guards has accused the government of deliberately ' orchestrating ' the flood of minors for ' political reasons ' ' the recent surge of children and teenagers from @entity112 showing up at our southern border is an administration - made disaster , ' @entity118 rep. @entity117 , who chairs the @entity119 , recently told @entity120			1
' @entity121 has gotten out around the world about president @entity28 's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the @entity9 illegally , ' @entity117 said in a statement			2
a report last week found that many of the children being held in @entity9 detention facilities had not bathed in days and were sleeping on plastic boards because holding facilities did n't have enough mattresses to go around			1
leaked photos from one base that were obtained by @entity135 show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms , sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows			0
' most of the time , they 're getting released to relatives in the @entity9 ' @entity79 told @entity82			2
' there 's nowhere to put them , so they 're released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date			0
' ' i 'd say between 95 and 97 per cent of adults or youths do n't show up for court			0
' vice president @entity2 will meet with senior representatives of @entity5 countries this week to ' emphasize that illegal immigration is not safe ' and clear up ' misconceptions ' about the @entity9 's policy on child immigration , a senior @entity1 official said sunday president @entity28 has called the influx of unaccompanied minors into the @entity9 an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response ' and has announced an ' interagency @entity166 to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation ' to be headed up by @entity173 secretary @entity172			1
now , the president has commissioned @entity2 to travel overseas to have ' intensive consultations ' with the governments of the children 's home countries			1
during his meetings @entity2 will talk with government officials from @entity15 , @entity20 and @entity19 about how the @entity9 wants to work together ' to try to make life better for these families and children in all of the countries of @entity112 , ' a senior administration official said			1
@entity2 is also expected to speak publicly about the issue , but the @entity28 administration official could offer no other details on when and where that might happen			0
the administration official told reporters that @entity2 would stress in his remarks publicly and privately that , ' putting your child in the hands of a criminal smuggling organization is not safe , and it is not worth subjecting children to a perilous journey when there is no light at the end of the tunnel			2

*vp* @entity2 plans to tell @entity5 nations ' representatives that it 's unsafe for minor children to travel hundreds of miles alone to the @entity9
the sudden burst of concern comes as thousands of under - 18s have flooded across @entity112 's southern border
just a week ago @entity2 told a *business* group that the @entity9 economy needs ' an unrelenting stream ' of new immigrants
children *nabbed* crossing into the @entity9 by @entity224 agents are being held for mere days before being released to family *members*
hardly any of them return for court dates with immigration judges , according to a leader of the @entity224 agents ' union
