by @entity0 there are still dangerously high radiation levels at @entity5 ’s crippled @entity4 nuclear reactor – but now the plant ’s owner is able to see the normally invisible threat			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) has created a prototype ‘ @entity11 ’ capable of creating images of gamma ray - emitting radioactive particles			1
this equipment is based on the gamma ray - observing sensor technology to be added to the agency ’s next x-ray observation satellite , @entity21 - @entity20 radiation - seeker : the @entity11 is capable of creating images of gamma ray - emitting particles it is expected to be able to create visual images of radioactive particles that have collected at high altitudes such as building roofs where it is difficult to conduct measurements with existing equipment			1
it can also detect particles that have widely dispersed on the ground and residential houses			0
last month @entity9 , the @entity37 and the plant ’s owner , the @entity36 conducted a successful field test of the camera at the @entity43 area of @entity45 village in @entity46			2
threat assessment : @entity4 workers will be able to use the camera to pinpoint the normally invisible threat the camera was developed for the agency ¿ s next x-ray observation satellite , @entity54 the fukushima nuclear disaster in @entity5 triggered was triggered by a giant tsunami radioactive contamination from the @entity4 power plant disaster has been detected in the @entity59 more than 370 miles off the @entity5 coast			1
samples of plants , plankton and ocean water showed levels of the liquid metal caesium were almost 1,000 times greater than normal			0
but although the readings , taken three months after the meltdown in march last year , were high radiation risks are only a tenth of those generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers			2
dr @entity74 , of the @entity75 in @entity76 , and colleagues said radioactive elements were detected in zoop at the moment there is still fatally high radiation levels at the plant and much less water to cool it than officials had thought , according to an internal examination			1
the news has renewed doubts about the plant 's stability and provoked fears the other two reactors that had meltdowns could be in even worse shape			2
a tool equipped with a tiny video camera , a thermometer , a dosimeter and a water gauge was used to assess damage inside the no. 2 reactor 's containment chamber for the second time since the tsunami swept into the @entity4 plant a year ago			0
the no. 2 reactor is the only one officials have been able to closely examine so far			0
the data collected showed the damage from the disaster is so severe , the plant operator will have to develop special equipment and technology to tolerate the harsh environment and decommission the plant , a process expected to last decades			0
the crippled @entity4 nuclear power station is seen through a bus window in @entity119 , @entity5			0

' @entity11 ' developed for x-ray observation satellite , @entity54
scan comes as radiation detected 370 miles from plant
