by @entity0 there are some counter-intuitive beauty tricks that you can understand might just work — massaging skin to prevent wrinkles or applying your conditioner before your shampoo for bigger hair			1
and then there are some that are just bonkers			0
at least that was my reaction when i heard @entity14 ’s recipe for near - perfect skin at 79 , which i assumed would comprise an entire arsenal of potions to ensure her skin is as bouncy as one of her souffles			1
but no. the secret to her success is , basically , nothing			0
@entity14 , 79 , has near perfect skin ; but she does n't use any face creams ‘ i do n’t have any beauty regime , ’ she said in a recent interview			1
‘ i just use one foundation , one powder , one lipstick			0
why bother ? i do n’t use any face creams at all			1
’ the very thought of going without moisturiser almost brought me out in a rash , but i was intrigued that someone could forego it entirely and not look craggier than a cliff face — not least because my own skincare regime costs me dearly			1
there ’s my two day moisturisers : @entity41 ’s @entity40 ( £ 34 ) to tackle the oiliness around my t - zone , and @entity44 ( £ 80 ) , which promises to target signs of ageing			1
then a good eye cream : boots @entity48 ( £ 19.50 ) , which i pat on religiously every morning			1
at night , i add @entity49 ( £ 26 ) , to soothe dryness			1
in all , my moisturisers cost me close to £ 160 every four months			1
that alone was enough to entice me to put @entity14 ’s method to the test			1
for a month i decided to pack all my potions away and , after washing with @entity56 & @entity57 ( £ 13.25 ) cleanser morning and night , do nothing else			1
of course , i ’m concerned any savings will come at the expense of irreversible skin damage			1
and , at 40 , that ’s a risk i can scarce afford			0
@entity0 when she was still using face creams but at the same time i , like every woman i know , have a sneaking suspicion i ’m being sold a pup by the beauty industry			1
the average woman will spend £ 18,000 on skincare in a lifetime but , deep down , i suspect we all know that no amount can really stop the ravages of time			1
and , of course , i wondered if all my unguents were actually making my skin worse : after all , the cocktail of chemicals i slather on every night is far from natural			1
‘ we tend to overcomplicate skincare , ’ says cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity81			2
‘ men often do little more than splash water on their face ; by comparison , women often create problems by embracing trends that do n’t necessarily suit their skin type			1
’ my month - long trial would begin with a test to assess the condition of my skin , then another one four weeks later to assess any change			1
at @entity97 ’s @entity96 , @entity95 uses a @entity99 device to analyse my skin for sun damage , wrinkles , redness and pore size			2
it ’s a mixed bag : my wrinkles are good for my age , but my moisture levels are low ( galling considering all that time and money ) and my pores and redness are particularly bad			0
but it is the fact the machine says i have @entity116 damage — the thing that ages skin most drastically — that alarms me the most			2
i ’m dreading the month ahead			2
for the first week , i sorely miss my moisturisers			0
after every wash , my skin feels tight and flaky			2
but by midweek , i realise my foundation has much greater staying power and my skin is staying matte for longer			2
still , i dread the tightness that appears after the smallest splash of water — so i avoid washing it off for as long as possible			0
the sensation makes me super-aware of my skin			2
i ’m used to carrying on with my day without giving my face a second thought , but without moisturiser i can concentrate on little else			2
on the monday of the second week i meet a friend for lunch			0
i recoil as she examines my face			2
‘ i ca n’t see any differences , ’ she mutters			0
‘ maybe i can ditch the creams , too ? ’ the most expensive moisturiser in the world , by @entity138 , costs £ 8,500 for a 50g pot however , the tightness has been joined by an angry community of spots on my chin — @entity81 says this can be common on first giving up moisturiser as skin produces excess oil to compensate			1
after three weeks my skin feels a little rougher			2
my make - up now sits on newly formed outcrops of dry skin on my cheeks and around my nose			1
but otherwise i ’m pleasantly surprised — my skin looks clearer and creamier , and i ’ve even started to forget about the tightness			2
i also stop worrying that people can tell , as if going without moisturiser is some dark secret			0
after all , it ’s so ingrained in our routine that to say you skip it is tantamount to saying you do n’t care about your appearance			0
at last , when the month is up i race to my second consultation with @entity95 , safe in the knowledge that as soon as i get home i can bathe myself in @entity168			2
i expect to be told that my skin is wizened and damaged in some way , but i ’m shocked by the results			0
some , i was expecting ; he can immediately see the skin damage from a spell in the sun during the first week , when i forgot i was n’t wearing my @entity176 - containing cream			1
@entity0 after a month of not using face creams my skin also has around 10 per cent less moisture and the wrinkles around my eyes have deepened			1
i can live with dry skin , but wrinkles are something i ’ve spent money on trying to avoid — though @entity95 assures me these should plump back up with a good eye cream			1
there are , however , some surprising benefits			0
the redness has dramatically reduced and my pores are ten times less visible — a clear reversal of a key sign of ageing			0
@entity81 tells me that the tightness i felt after washing was because my cleanser was too harsh , disrupting the skin ’s natural barrier			0
that ’s easily solved by using a cream cleanser and a flannel			0
i now use @entity202 ( £ 19.99 )			0
‘ creams also plump up wrinkles , making them less obvious , but they wo n’t stop them forming , ’ @entity81 says			0
‘ the reduction of pores may be down to them being clogged by creams			0
most people just need good sun protection , which has moisturising properties itself			0
‘ all women should apply healthy scepticism when deciding if a product ’s claims are plausible , ’ she adds			0
‘ what we do know is that a product as simple as an inexpensive moisturiser can improve the appearance of fine lines and that many “ anti-ageing ” creams are doing little more than that			0
’ i ’ve come to the conclusion that my moisturiser buying has been hugely influenced by fear			0
fear of looking old , fear of flakiness			0
now i see past the beauty companies ’ spin i know exactly what my face needs — a decent @entity176 ( which will keep tightness at bay , too ) and an eye cream to keep those wrinkles plumped			1
and at £ 15.50 for both , my bank balance , as well as my skin , is already thanking me .			1

@entity14 , 79 , says her recipe for perfect skin is to not use face creams
the average woman spends £ 18,000 on skincare in a lifetime
@entity0 goes face cream free for a one - month - trial
now she knows exactly what her face does - and does n't - need
