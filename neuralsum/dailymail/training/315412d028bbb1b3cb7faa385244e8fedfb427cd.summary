by @entity1 reporter published : 10:14 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 15:20 est , 6 march 2014 a @entity4 judge has ruled that a man who doused a boy with gasoline and lit him on fire when he was a teenager can now be tried as an adult for murder even though the incident took place 13 years before the victim died			1
authorities allege that @entity15 was 13 when he attacked @entity16 in 1998 on his eighth birthday near the younger boy 's home in @entity20 , about 35 miles northeast of @entity21			1
@entity16 was burned across 99 per cent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer blamed on his burns			1
scroll down for @entity26 brought to court : @entity28 , seen here wednesday , can now face murder charges more than a decade after attacking a former neighbor with acid			0
the boy survived but died from complications from the burns years later back in court : @entity15 was sent to juvenile detention for a few months immediately after the attack but never had a full trial or faced criminal charges , but that will likely change with the new ruling @entity16 had initially named @entity15 as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998			1
@entity15 spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to pursue the case			1
shortly before he died , @entity16 gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused @entity15 for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack			2
the sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case , and prosecutors charged the now 28 - year - old @entity15 with murder last year â € ” but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take him to trial			1
before and after : @entity16 , seen left before the attack , faced constant health problems for the remainder of this life , seen right in an undated photo of him years later heartbreaking : he was left with 99 per cent of his skin covered in burns , and eventually died due to skin cancer in 2011 after a three - day hearing on that issue this week , state district judge @entity68 ruled that @entity72 ' case could be transferred			1
the ruling enables the prosecutors ' murder case against @entity15			2
@entity76 , @entity16 's mother , said she was relieved the case would go to trial			0
' when @entity16 died we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen , maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him , ' she said			0
' it 's been a long road			0
' turning back time : @entity15 ' lawyer said that it is against his constitutional rights to be tried as an adult for something he did when he was a child because so much time has passed in between the attack and now seeking justice : @entity76 told how it has been ' a long road ' in fighting for the case to go to court keeping the focus on her son : mrs @entity76 , seen in the @entity4 court room on wednesday , has continued the fight since her son died of skin cancer in 2011 several witnesses testified during this week 's hearing that @entity15 had confessed to them or others that he had been responsible for the attack on @entity16			1
part of @entity16 's taped deposition also was shown during the hearing			0
in a separate case , @entity15 was convicted of sexually assaulting another 8 - year - old boy			1
now an adult , the victim testified during this week 's hearing that @entity15 had threatened to burn him if he told anybody what happened			2
@entity15 ' attorney , @entity118 , had argued that moving the case to adult court would violate his client 's constitutional rights			2
@entity118 also questioned the reliability of @entity16 's statements , as well as secondhand statements made by other witnesses , saying there was ' no new credible evidence in this case			0
' seeking justice : @entity76 came face to face with her son 's attacker in october - the first time in 15 years @entity118 argued that the case should not be transferred to adult court because under state law in 1998 , a juvenile had to be at least 14 years old for a capital felony offense case to be transferred to adult court			2
the law was changed in 1999 to lower the age to 10			0
prosecutors said the crime of murder did not take place until 2011 , well after the law was changed			0
but @entity118 said the law could n't be applied retroactively to @entity15			0
@entity15 , who is being held on a $ 1 million bond , will remain jailed as he faces up to 10 years in prison for a charge in neighboring @entity152 of failing to register as a sex offender .			0
