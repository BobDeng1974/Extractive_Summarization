’ governor : the @entity9 chief tried to reassure homeowners saying increases will be ' gradual ' cost : the chancellor , pictured , said house prices are still lower in real terms than they were in 2007 - and they were forecast to stay below that peak for some years to come pose : @entity13 with lord mayor of the @entity65 @entity64 and @entity8			1
of interest hikes , the bank chief said : ' it could happen sooner than markets currently expect ' the @entity70 and the @entity9 are keen to be seen to be alive to the potential risks of a housing bubble , though mr @entity13 insisted last night there was no evidence that rising prices yet posed any danger			2

‘ so there is no immediate cause for alarm			0
indeed the most recent data shows that mortgage approvals have actually slowed			0
’ however , mr @entity13 said ‘ causes for concern ’ were ‘ on the horizon ’ , adding : ‘ if @entity65 prices were to continue growing at these rates , that would be too fast for comfort			2
financiers : invited guests listen to the speakers during evening 's dinner guests : row after row of guests listen as speakers deliver their speeches ‘ let me spell it out : does the housing market pose an immediate threat to financial stability today ? no , it does n’t			0

’ business secretary @entity171 said he was ‘ appalled ’ that banks were offering mortgages worth up to five times borrowers ’ salaries – and indicated he believed a stable level was ‘ three or three and a half times ’			1
