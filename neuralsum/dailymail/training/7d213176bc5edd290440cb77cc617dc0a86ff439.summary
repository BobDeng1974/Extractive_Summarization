by @entity0 last updated at 5:13 pm on 8th august 2011 hero : @entity3 's attempts to save @entity5 's life were hindered by a faulty rifle , which did not fire the first four bullets properly the rifle used to kill a polar bear which mauled an @entity12 schoolboy to death failed to fire four times , investigators revealed last night			1
the news paints a dramatic picture of expedition leader @entity3 ’s heroic attempts to save @entity5 , 17 , who was attacked while sleeping in his tent on the @entity20 archipelago of @entity21			1
mr @entity3 , who himself suffered serious injuries , tried to kill the bear but the first four bullets simply fell out of the magazine when he pulled the trigger			1
as the animal rampaged among the five tents occupied by 11 pupils and two leaders for several minutes , frantic teenagers threw rocks at it in an effort to save themselves			1
then , despite his own terrible injuries , mr @entity3 managed to reload the rifle , march up to the snarling creature and – not even knowing whether the gun would work this time – shoot it in the head at short range			1
the animal was eight stone underweight and had an almost empty stomach , it was revealed last night			2
police have sent the ‘ old @entity48 ’ rifle to @entity49 for tests to discover whether the @entity51 had taken adequate precautions in case of an attack			1
the chilling details emerged as the victim ’s parents sought answers to why a string of safety measures failed or were not in place for the expedition			1
@entity5 , left , has been described as ' strong , fearless and kind ' by his family			1
right , his father @entity64			2
his family said he had been excited about becoming a doctor and praised his sense of humour the party were camping in an area where polar bears had been seen in recent weeks at a time when the animals are short of food			2
autopsy : a pair of scientists examine the body of the polar bear that was shot dead after attacking @entity5 experts recommend using look - outs , trained guard dogs and preferably installing two trip wires attached to explosive flares to scare off bears			1
but the @entity20 police investigation revealed yesterday that no - one was keeping watch at the camp when the bear approached at 7.30am on friday			1
a spokesman for the governor of @entity21 said : ‘ it is now clear that the bear had entered the tent camp unnoticed			1
it seems that the trip wire has not been detonated			2
’ asked whether anyone was keeping watch , she said : ‘ as far as i know , everybody was in the tents			1
’ the bear poked his head into the tent where @entity106 and his friend @entity105 were sleeping and began to bite and claw at them as they desperately tried to defend themselves			2
alerted by their screams , mr @entity3 and @entity113 , who were running the expedition on behalf of the @entity51 , rushed to the scene and were themselves slashed and bitten			1
@entity118 , a @entity20 government investigator , said mr @entity3 picked up a gun with four cartridges in it , but ‘ he loaded it , and pulled the trigger , each time nothing ’			1
mr @entity113 tried to light a flare to frighten the bear off , but this too failed to spark			2
captured : the male polar bear is examined by an official after it was shot by members of the expedition online tributes to the killer polar bear have been condemned as ‘ offensive ’ to the victim ’s family			1
one @entity140 page – called ‘ @entity142 ’ – was taken down following criticism			2
but a series of other insensitive pages remained			2
several @entity140 users also attacked @entity106 , left , for being a public schoolboy			0
one wrote : ‘ @entity151 ’ , while another said : ‘ if you go camping with polar bears then you should n’t be shocked when they try to eat you			0
’ but one person said of the tributes to the bear : ‘ this is offensive and honestly disgusting			0
you need to consider how this is going to make friends and family of @entity106 feel			0
’ and @entity159 wrote : ‘ whoever made this page is a sick , attention - seeking individual			0
’ so the bear continued its rampage , injuring another member of the party , @entity167			0
one of the other students picked up the rifle and tried to fire it , but realised it was empty			0
it was then that mr @entity3 summoned all his remaining strength to pick up a cartridge from the ground and shoot the animal			0
@entity106 ’s father @entity64 , 49 , an orthopaedic surgeon , and mother @entity177 , 46 , a gp , from @entity181 , near @entity182 in @entity183 , are in @entity184 to formally identify their son ’s body which has been transported back to mainland @entity20			0
the couple , who were travelling with @entity106 ’s younger brothers @entity188 and @entity190 , were too upset to comment yesterday			0
but a source close to the family said yesterday : ‘ they are still not fully in the picture as to what happened and have many questions as to whether enough was done to protect their son ’s life			0
’ mr @entity118 said : ‘ the routines of the @entity202 company have to be looked into			0
’ experienced : guides @entity203 and @entity113 will remain in @entity20 before they are flown home with the other two injured survivors happy family : @entity203 with , from left his sisters @entity210 and @entity212 , father @entity213 and mother @entity209 mr @entity113 , 27 , from @entity214 , and mr @entity3 , 29 , from @entity215 – were still in intensive care yesterday			0
@entity167 and @entity105 , were sent by air ambulances to their homes in @entity202 yesterday			0
@entity167 ’s father @entity219 said : ‘ friday was without doubt the worst day of my life and it will never leave me to think how close @entity167 came to being killed that day			0
’ he said @entity167 suffered a fractured jaw , head injuries and lost some teeth in the attack			0
a spokesman for @entity51 said yesterday : ‘ the @entity51 followed best practice in everything they did			0
