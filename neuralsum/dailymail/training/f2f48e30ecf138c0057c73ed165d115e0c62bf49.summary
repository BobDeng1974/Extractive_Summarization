by @entity0 a pet dog was crushed to death by a 16ft - long python in front of a @entity6 mother and her two horrified young children			1
art dealer @entity8 was on a countryside hike with daughter @entity11 , seven , son @entity12 , five , and their five dogs when the snake struck			1
@entity16 , a mongrel cross , had run ahead of the family along a path in @entity21 ’s @entity20 on saturday			1
tragic : family pet @entity16 , who was crushed to death by a snake while out walking with its owners on saturday			1
the family were walking in @entity20 when the 16ft creature struck mrs @entity8 , 41 , tried to fight off the snake by hitting the serpent with a walking stick but eventually fled with her children when she realised @entity16 was dead			1
the tragedy comes two weeks after a @entity6 couple fought off a python attacking their dog in another part of the same park			1
different snakes are believed to be responsible for the two attacks , which were five miles apart , but the latest incident was in an area where there have been three other python attacks on dogs in recent years , one of them fatal			2
mrs @entity8 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , deals in @entity52 art and has lived in @entity21 with her husband and children for two years			1
they are planning an imminent return to @entity6 as their two older children are at boarding school in the @entity6			1
mrs @entity8 yesterday explained how @entity16 , who the family adopted from a rescue centre , was killed by the snake			1
shock : @entity8 with another one of her pets			2
she said today the attack was ' terrifying ' ‘ it was massive , ’ she said			0
‘ it had to easily be about 16ft because @entity16 was a big dog of about four - and - a - half stone and he was almost the size of my @entity71			1
‘ the scary thing is that it happened so quickly , from hearing @entity16 ’s awful squeal and coming round the corner to being confronted by the horrific sight of the huge snake coiled around @entity16			1
the kids were screaming and the other dogs were barking			0
‘ after about a minute of me hitting it , @entity16 stopped squealing and i knew that was it			2
‘ there was nothing i could do and i just had to get the kids and the other dogs away			0
‘ we are all very upset			0
@entity16 was a rescue puppy			2
he was about 18 months old and a lovely dog			0
‘ it was a horrific thing to witness and to feel so helpless			0
i had my husband ’s diving knife in the back pack because i had read about the snake attack the other week , but the snake was colossal and i was so scared it would turn on the kids			0
‘ my youngest is about the same size as @entity16			2
i keep thinking “ what if my son @entity12 had been in front ? ”			0
what would the snake have done to him ? it ’s just too horrible to contemplate			0
’ two weeks ago @entity6 expatriates @entity104 and her husband @entity106 managed to rescue their 4st dog @entity108 from the grip of a python which attacked as they walked around a coastal peninsula about five miles from the scene of saturday ’s attack			1
there have been three other python attacks on dogs since 2006 close to the spot of the latest attack			2
two were rescued but the third , a husky , died			0
briton @entity122 , who works as a part - time snake catcher in @entity21 , said it was possible the python which attacked @entity16 could be the same snake behind the three previous attacks			1
a python , similar to the one that attacked and crushed @entity16 to death			1
the attack comes just two weeks after another @entity6 couple lost their dog to a snake in the same @entity21 park he recommended pet owners not let their dogs off the leash , as pythons were predators which lie in wait for passing mammals			1
‘ many times people ask me what they should they do if a python attacks their dog , ’ he said			2
‘ you have to really go for it			0
grab it by the tail and start yanking it and walking backwards			0
‘ pythons do n’t like the idea of not being anchored down			0
it might tighten up at first but keeping pulling it by the tail and it will let go			0
’ pythons are @entity21 ’s biggest natural predator and are protected under law			0
they can grow up to 20ft long and normally feed on small mammals and wild boar .			0
