the 69 - year - old had died from heart problems , a coroner found , at least one month before he was discovered			2

the gold , including coins from @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity56 and @entity80 dating to 1872 , was hauled from the garage using a wheelbarrow and truck , then deposited for safekeeping			1
@entity85 clerk recorder @entity84 told @entity86 that only coins were found in mr @entity3 ’s house			1
‘ there were no bars at all			0
there were all sorts of coins , though – @entity78 , @entity68 sovereigns , @entity56 ducats , ( @entity57 ) krugerrands , most of it was @entity63 $ 20 gold pieces			1

mr @entity106 ’s family has owned a jewellery store in the area for more than 130 years			0
mr @entity84 told @entity86 that the $ 7million appraisal was ‘ just on what we think the gold weight of it , ’ meaning that the actual value of the coinage could very well be worth much more			1

gold rush : his cousin , @entity37 , will likely inherit the entire coin collection , though she has n't had contact with him in more than a year other things found in the ' anti-government ' pensioner 's home included a stash of conspiracy theory books and several guns , mr @entity84 said			1
