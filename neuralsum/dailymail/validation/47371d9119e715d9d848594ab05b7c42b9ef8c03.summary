i was actually thinking i would n't mind riding the horse in next year 's @entity53			1

the horses have been running well all week , but there 's nothing like a winner here			0
' it 's the only way to ride him , to let him bowl along and we wanted to see if he was a queen mother horse earlier in the season			0
' to be fair , @entity46 said at halfway he was wishing he 'd run in the @entity150 as he did n't think he 'd last home but it was only last year he was narrowly beaten here in the @entity155 and then won a grade one at @entity157			0
' @entity160 ground helps and some of his jumps today were breathtaking			0

' of @entity28 , @entity164 , representing owners @entity165 and @entity167 , said : ' she ran a brilliant race and i 'm delighted for the connections of the winner as he 's an ex-million in mind horse and i think the visor has probably helped him			1
