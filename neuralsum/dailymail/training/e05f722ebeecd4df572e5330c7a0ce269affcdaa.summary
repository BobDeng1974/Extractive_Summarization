@entity2 minority leader @entity1 is set to appoint a @entity4 lawmaker to the @entity5 , congressional aides said tuesday , giving him access to some of @entity9 's most closely held secrets in the war on terror			1
the move will come as the world is still grappling with an @entity16 death squad 's massacre last week of journalists at the @entity19 satire magazine @entity18 , executed because they had published a cartoon of the @entity4 prophet @entity21			2
rep. @entity22 has attracted suspicion for his public statements , including a 2012 @entity25 convention where he said @entity9 's schools should be modelled after @entity28 madrassas			1
moments later he warned undercover law enforcement skulking around the event looking for ' secret meetings ' that ' @entity32 will not allow you to stop us			1
he is one of only two @entity4 members of @entity54 , the other being @entity60 democrat @entity59			1
voters sent him to @entity54 in a 2008 special election following the death of his grandmother , who held the seat before him			0
he was already a member of the @entity67 subcommittee on intelligence , and once worked for the @entity70 ’s ' @entity69 ' – a data - sharing hub that merges intelligence collected by the @entity73 , the @entity74 , the @entity75 and the @entity76			0
but his elevation to the @entity78 , first reported by @entity79 , will cause rumbles among lawmakers who charge that the @entity9 government – particularly the @entity45 administration – has studiously avoided linking @entity84 with the steady stream of deadly attacks that plague @entity87 , @entity88 and the @entity89			1
at the 2012 @entity25 convention in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity22 said that ' @entity9 will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model that we have in our madrassas , in our schools , where innovation is encouraged , where the foundation is the @entity28			1
' ' and that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students			0
' he drew applause when he acknowledged the presence of undercover federal law enforcement in the audience – agents who were drawn to the event because of the high concentration of @entity4 leaders			2
' there are over 7 million @entity4 in this country , ' @entity22 told the crowd			2
' and while we are under attack , we can not retreat			0
' ' it 's unfortunate that there are those who are thinking that , at this convention right now , we 're having secret meetings , that we 're plotting to destroy this country			0
but i say to those who are here undercover : @entity32 will not allow you to stop us			2
' after the speech made headlines , @entity22 's office released a statement saying he was misunderstood – and meant his remarks as a broad endorsement of religious education			1
' faith - based schools throughout this country have excelled because of innovative instructional methods and a willingness to engage different learning styles – whether visual , auditory , or kinesthetic , ' he said			0
' while i do not believe that any particular faith should be the foundation of our public schools , it is important that we take note of the instructional tools these schools utilize to empower their young people			0
@entity152 , @entity153 , and @entity25 schools have experienced notable success by casting off a one - size - fits - all approach to education , and this is a model we must replicate			0
' @entity22 was raised in a @entity159 family , attended parochial schools , and converted to @entity84 as an adult in 1998			1
@entity163 minority leader : @entity1 , a former @entity2 speaker and the chamber 's highest ranking @entity164 , has reportedly decided to give @entity22 a slot on the all - knowing intelligence committee although he was quick to backtrack on his advice about madrassas , @entity22 has never publicly addressed his comments about violent extremism and law enforcement 's ability to stop it			1
@entity22 's press secretary did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
in a @entity178 interview two months ago , he reflected on his time as a police officer assigned to track terrorism and conduct counter-intelligence			0
' what i learned is that in the @entity9 , as in the @entity187 , it is impossible to fight the threat of global terror without help from @entity4 , ' the congressman said			2
' but there is a problem with institutional bigotry			0
' @entity22 also claimed that ' xenophobia has become exacerbated because of extremist elements [ within @entity84 ] , but i still say that @entity4 have to take control of our own destiny and to reclaim our destiny we have to engage in a political process			1

@entity56 @entity51 rep. @entity22 will soon sit on a *legislative* committee where some of @entity9 's most precious secrets are examined
the former policeman converted to @entity84 as an adult and is one of only two @entity4 members of @entity54
he attracted scorn with a 2012 speech in which he said @entity9 schools would be more innovative if they were more like @entity25 madrassas
@entity22 claimed he was misunderstood but never addressed another line in the speech that seemed to taunt undercover agents who were present
' @entity32 will not allow you to stop us , ' he said
