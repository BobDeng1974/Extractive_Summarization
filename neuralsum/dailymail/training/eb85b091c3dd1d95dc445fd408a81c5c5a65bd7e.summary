@entity0 is back on form on @entity2			1
he loves a good @entity2 rant , this time calling out @entity4 for a fight			1
it 's great news for us that the leading domestic heavyweights are realising that @entity10 is the ' money ' in the division and even though that fight wo n't be next , i can certainly see it happening in 2015			1
you know how i feel about that fight - @entity4 would destroy him			1
but i give @entity0 plenty of credit - he is a talented young fighter with a wicked sense of humour ! about 90 per cent of people who replied to his rant on @entity2 share that view			1
no one can see @entity0 taking a clean shot off @entity4 , who i can reveal here will likely have a fight on january 31 at the @entity29 in @entity30			1
@entity4 ( left ) in action against @entity33 @entity32 at @entity30 's @entity29 earlier this month @entity0 is back on form on @entity2 and recently called @entity4 out for a fight in december even though @entity0 has only fought twice in 18 months and has gone off the radar , we ’d love to make the fight for @entity10			1
the interest will be immense , but i think that is the case for all his fights at the moment			0
the public realise he is a special talent and i , as his promoter , know that very well			0
that is why we are doing everything right			0
we are picking the right opponents at the right times to enable him to grow as a fighter			0
@entity55 , another talented @entity56 heavyweight , is also keen and even though the @entity56 public see that as an easy night 's work for @entity10 i believe it 's a stern test , particularly at this stage of his career , but for all these guys there can only be one outcome - aj by the big ko			2
as it happens , @entity4 is destroying everything in sight			2
he is out next against @entity69 on november 22 , which should hopefully provide him with his biggest challenge			0
@entity69 is durable , as is @entity32 , but we saw what @entity4 did to him last time out			2
we called @entity69 after @entity10 beat @entity32 to check he still wanted it			0
i think he was offended			0
he is training hard and has already told me to make sure i pay him well for the rematch ! we are confident for another impressive win but anything can happen in heavyweight boxing			2
then i hope to put him on a show at the @entity29 on january 31			1
@entity80 is a name that 's been touted			1
surely he can give @entity10 the rounds ? after that , bring on the @entity84			0
in @entity0 , @entity55 , @entity86 and @entity87 there is a pathway of excellent fights and i want , as a fan , to see them all			2
i am still working on making a fight between @entity93 and @entity94			1
i think it ’s the only fight at the moment that would motivate him to go back into a training camp			0
to make it , @entity99 has a few issues he needs to resolve with his promoters , @entity102			0
if they can do that then it is my job to deliver this fight for @entity93			1
obviously @entity108 was hoping to fight @entity93 , but he must now focus on his november 22 fight against @entity110			1
that ’s a tough fight and i give @entity108 massive credit for taking such a big test when he is already mandatory			1
assuming @entity93 vacates his @entity115 super-middleweight world title , @entity108 as the mandatory challenger will then fight for the belt in early 2015			1
@entity108 as a world champion – i can see that appealing to @entity93			1
summer 2015 at @entity121 for a unification fight ? let ’s wait and see			1
@entity93 lifts his arms in the air after defeating @entity126 at @entity121 back in may video @entity93 v @entity126 highlights @entity108 celebrates after beating @entity129 in the fourth round at @entity121 on may 31 the november 22 show now features @entity126 fighting against @entity132			1
i see this as a massive banana skin for @entity126			2
on paper he should be comfortable			0
but i rate @entity132 close to @entity138 , who took @entity126 the distance in his last fight			1
for @entity132 , this is his big chance to make a name for himself			1
for @entity126 , you have to wonder how driven he is after what happened against @entity93 at @entity121			1
@entity132 is certainly confident , judging by his comments			2
he ’ll be looking to take @entity126 into the second half of the fight so he can see how much @entity126 wants it			1
@entity126 needs to be careful			2
brit @entity126 ( right ) takes on @entity149 's @entity138 at @entity150 last month i love a top - level domestic fight , i think they are special			1
when the two guys are from the same city then you have something unique			0
i think that is what we have in @entity160 and @entity161 in @entity162			1
it is a great fight city			0
i have taken four shows there following the one at the weekend and they are getting better and better			0
the people there realise they are fortunate to have two world - class lightweights on their doorstep and those same fighters are on a collision course for a huge fight in the summer			1
the way they both handled themselves on my @entity162 show at the weekend was perfect			0
@entity160 pulled off a stunning knockout against the brilliant and well - prepared @entity179			2
@entity179 spent seven weeks over here preparing but had no answer to @entity160			2
@entity160 celebrates after winning his fight against @entity179 at @entity182 on saturday @entity160 has made a name for himself in his own right			2
people thought he would fade away a bit after losing to @entity187 last year , but he has been superb since coming back			0
@entity161 , meanwhile , is an @entity188 champion - turned - world champion in the making			2
i am certain of it			0
he has done so much in so few fights			0
i think he will be a star at this weight and win another title in the next division as well			0
@entity161 versus @entity160 is a fight i have already started working on			1
@entity198 and the @entity199 are both interested in a summer fight			2
the date of may 30 at the @entity199 has been discussed but it might clash with rugby , so we are considering alternatives			0
i want them both to fight again in february or march and then it ’s the big one			0
@entity161 poses for the cameras following his win inside five rounds over @entity210 in @entity162 all the indications are that we might finally see @entity212 and @entity213 get in the ring together			1
like all fans i ’ve found it infuriating that the two best fighters never went in the ring			0
now it looks like it will happen			0
it ’s a couple of years too late for my taste but it ’s a fight we all want to see anyway			0
i think @entity212 realises that this is the only major box office draw left			2
i don ’ t see him fighting @entity225 and none of the other names are particularly interesting			0
a fight with @entity213 is worth mega money and it ’s a fight i think he wins			1
if they had fought four or five years ago i think it would have been close with @entity212 edging it			0
i think he will win more comfortably if they fight next year			0
for now , i just want to see it happen			0
@entity212 looks on during his fight against @entity238 at the @entity239 in @entity240 last month @entity213 trains during a media workout in @entity242 on monday ahead of his @entity244 title fight we are deep in talks for two of our top fighters to challenge for the world title , one here and one in @entity252			1
expect these in january and february and also expect more world champs for @entity56			0

despite @entity0 's @entity2 rant , a fight with @entity4 wo n't happen until next year
i can reveal @entity4 will fight on january 31 at @entity29 , *possibly* against @entity80
@entity93 - @entity108 is a *possibility* for @entity121 next summer
looks like @entity212 - @entity213 is on - my money 's on @entity212
@entity126 could be in trouble against @entity132
