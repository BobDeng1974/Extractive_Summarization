controversial : one million moms wants to boycott @entity5 because it sold this issue of life with @entity15 where its openly gay character @entity16 gets married to a man @entity30 said on its website : ' these comic books are sold at the front checkout counters so they are highly visible to employees , managers , customers and children			1
' unfortunately , children are now being exposed to same - sex marriage in a toy store			2
' this is the last place a parent would expect to be confronted with questions from their children on topics that are too complicated for them to understand			0
' issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon , which is becoming extremely common and unnecessary			0
' protest : one million moms wants a boycott of @entity5 stores because it sold a comic where a gay man gets married ' the trip to the toy store turns into a premature discussion on sexual orientation and is completely uncalled for			1
@entity5 should be more responsible in the products they carry			0
' the series of @entity15 comics trace the adventures of teenagers @entity15 , @entity62 and @entity63 in the small town of @entity65			0

he told the @entity75 : ' as i 've said before , @entity65 is a safe , welcoming place that does not judge anyone			0

but they have every right to their opinion , just like we have the right to stand by ours			0
' @entity16 will forever be a part of @entity65 , and he will live a happy , long life free of prejudice , hate and narrow - minded people			0
