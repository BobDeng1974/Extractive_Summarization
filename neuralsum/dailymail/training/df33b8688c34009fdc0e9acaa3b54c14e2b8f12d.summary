in extreme cases , it can cause inflammation of the brain leading to death			2
' mosquitoes are an unusual insect because bacteria can survive in its gut and then it can be regurgitated or come out in its saliva when it bites , and that ’s how you get transmission , ' said entomologist @entity64			0
the disease is rarely fatal , and is often more of a discomfort			0
it can not be transmitted directly from human to human			1

preventive measures : officials are stepping up the spraying of mosquito - prone areas to reduce their populations ‘ it ’s not clear yet , how many more cases are there to follow in addition to these initial cases , ’ he explained another official told the paper counties will now be spraying more often for mosquitoes			2
‘ we ’re trying to put in our plan on how to be a little more proactive with our spraying , ’ @entity84 ’s @entity141 chief @entity140 said			0
‘ we do n’t want to set a concrete plan ; we have to come up with an adjustable plan based on the mosquitoes , and adjust the plan routinely			0
