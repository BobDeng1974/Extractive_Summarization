@entity5 , 91 , helped save the life of her 97 - year - old neighbour @entity11 , after smoke filled his flat the flats in @entity27 , @entity28 where @entity5 pulled from @entity11 his smoke - filled home and on to a mobility scooter before firefighters arrived her swift actions meant the fire brigade could get to the flats in @entity27 , @entity28 - home to many elderly people - and extinguish a smouldering tea towel before it burst into flames			1
and the modest pensioner counts her blessings that waking up early allowed her to spot , and smell , the danger			0
she said : ' i wake up at 6am every day because i worked for 40 years and it 's programmed into my body clock			2
' that was very fortunate because at about 6.30am , i could smell smoke			2
' i went out into the corridor and i could smell it out there too , but i did n't know where it was coming from			0
' i came back to my flat to see if i 'd left anything on , but i had n't			2
firefighters claim @entity5 's super strength and quick - thinking probably saved @entity11 's life @entity54 , aged 20 , whilst serving in the 80th @entity55 ( @entity56 ) during @entity57 in 1942 ' i went back out and could see the smoke coming from under @entity11 's door			1
i banged and banged and shouted to him and he said ' just a minute '			0
' when he opened the door he was on the floor and the flat was absolutely full of smoke			1
' it was such a shock - it was bellowing out			0
' @entity11 then went back into his home and sat down in his front room , not realising how dangerous it was			1
' i went over and grabbed him by the arm and said ' come on , @entity11 ' , ' @entity5 explained			1
' i put my arm around him and helped him out of the door and he said ' where are we going ? ' so i said ' it 's all right , come with me '			2
' i got him out into the corridor and went and got a shop mobility aid for him to sit on , but by the time i did that he was on the floor again			0
' i managed to pull him up and sit him down , but he was very heavy , then i got him a glass of water and waited for the fire brigade to arrive			0
' it was a good job i was up early because otherwise @entity11 could have died in all that smoke			1
' and if his flat had caught fire it could have spread to all of our flats			2
a copy of the letter sent to @entity5 when she was awarded the @entity92 for 40 years civil service still active and healthy , every sunday @entity5 rings one of the bells at @entity96 ' these are private flats with people for places			1
we do n't have a warden here all the time , so if i 'd been up any later there would have been no way of me getting in if he could n't answer the door			0
' i had a bit of coughing from the smoke , but i 'm alright now			2
' @entity11 was taken to hospital suffering with smoke inhalation and has not yet returned home			1
@entity112 crews from @entity114 and @entity115 stations used a @entity117 extinguisher on what was believed to have been a tea towel mr @entity11 had left on a lamp to dry			1
miss @entity5 , who lives alone , worked for the civil service in the @entity122 for 40 years and was proud to receive the @entity92 ( @entity92 )			2
from 1942 to 1947 , she served her country with the 80th @entity124 - a time that taught her to be calm in an emergency			0
she added : ' being in the @entity55 definitely taught me a lot			0
' i do n't think i would still be here today if i had n't gone into the @entity55			0
it teaches you to keep calm in emergencies , keeps you fit and teaches you discipline			0
' we used to get up early and do 12 - mile route marches			0
' miss @entity5 does n't have any children , but dotes over her many nieces and nephews			2
still active and healthy , every sunday she rings one of the bells at @entity96 and during the @entity141 last summer managed to ring the bell for three - minutes non-stop to mark the event			0
relieved she was able to help mr @entity11 , her neighbour of 11 years , she added : ' you 've got to be alert even though you get older			1
' you 've still got to care for one another , because a lot of people do n't			0
' @entity112 and @entity149 spokesman @entity148 said : ' there is little doubt the actions of miss @entity54 played a significant part in averting a much more serious incident			0
' just a couple of breaths of smoke in a house fire is enough to kill , so the sooner you can get to a place of fresh air , the better			0
' although we would never advise anyone to enter a property that 's on fire , we thank miss @entity5 for the part she played that morning			1
' not everyone is fortunate enough to have such a quick - thinking neighbour , which is why installing smoke alarms on every level of your home and testing them on a regular basis is so important			1
' smoke alarms provide vital early warning of a fire , allowing you and your loved ones time to escape safely			0
