by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:02 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 23 september 2013 @entity3 singer @entity2 has been thwarted in her bid to take a ring once owned by @entity6 out of the @entity7			1
the @entity9 winner bought the gold and turquoise ring for £ 150,000 but ministers moved to impose an export ban to block her taking it to the @entity3 in the hope of finding a @entity7 buyer			1
donations from @entity19 fans from around the world , and tv gardener @entity21 , flooded in and has now been bought by the @entity6 's @entity22			1
precious : the ring is one of only three surviving pieces of jewellery known to have belonged to @entity6 thwarted : @entity9 winner @entity2 has been told she ca n't take the ring out of the @entity7 the ring had been in the @entity19 family for around 200 years before it was sold at auction last year			1
@entity2 , the first winner of talent show @entity9 , saw off seven bidders in an auction at @entity35 ’s last year for the gold and turquoise ring			1
still in its original box , it was sold for $ 235,596 despite being expected to fetch only $ 46,362			0
but when @entity2 applied for an export license , a reviewing committee recommended that the ring should be kept in the @entity7			1
the @entity6 's @entity22 in @entity44 , @entity45 , where the writer spent the last eight years of her life and where she penned all of her six completed novels , launched its fundraising campaign in august			1
it has now raised £ 157,740 to secure the ring which is expected to go on display in the @entity54			1
donations included a single pledge of £ 100,000 from an anonymous donor			0
@entity6 's house : this house in @entity44 , @entity45 , is where @entity6 spent the last eight years of her life , and now houses the @entity6 's @entity62 museum @entity2 said that she was glad that the museum had acquired the item			1
‘ the ring is a beautiful national treasure and i am happy to know that so many @entity6 fans will get to see it at @entity6 's @entity22 , ’ she said			1
it is not known whether @entity19 bought or was given the ring - which contains the december turquoise birthstone ( @entity19 's birth month ) - and symbolises wisdom and spiritual journeys			1
donor : tv gardener @entity21 was among those to give money to the campaign to keep the ring in the @entity7 after the world - famous author 's death in 1817 from an unknown illness , the ring was passed to her sister @entity85 who then gave it to her sister - in - law @entity87 on her engagement to the reverend @entity19			1
@entity89 , curator of the museum , which celebrates the 200th anniversary of the publication of @entity93 this year , said : ‘ @entity94 has been stunned by the generosity and light - footedness of all those who have supported our campaign to meet the costs of acquiring @entity6 ’s ring for our permanent collection			1
‘ visitors come from all around the world to see the house where she once lived and we will now take great pleasure in displaying this pretty ring for their appreciation			2
‘ the government ’s decision to decline an export licence reflects how rarely @entity19 ’s personal effects turn up in today ’s art market , and having missed out at auction in 2012 we are thrilled to have had this second chance to bring it home to @entity44			2
’ culture minister @entity117 said : ‘ the export licensing system provides us with a “ last chance ” to save treasures like these for the nation so they can be enjoyed by all of us			2
it ’s clear from the number of people who gave generously to the campaign just how admired @entity6 remains to this day			2
’ the museum , which has also raised enough cash to pay for costs associated with showing the ring , such as its display and insurance , already has two other pieces of jewellery owned by the author of @entity136 and @entity137 - a turquoise bracelet and a topaz cross			1
@entity19 is set to appear on the new £ 10 banknote following a campaign to have a woman on the currency			0
share what you think the comments below have not been moderated			0
@entity147 , somewhere in @entity3 , @entity3 , 1 day ago i think @entity2 should sell the ring back at a higher price to the drama queens			1
they should not have put it up for auction to any " outsiders " if they wanted @entity19 's ring to stay in @entity158			2
it appears the warning , @entity159 applies big time in @entity158			0
i get the ring sentimental value for its connection to the famous authoress			2
it is n't an attractive ring			2
i 'd rather get a gorgeous ring from the house of @entity168			2
@entity169 , my @entity170 , @entity171 , 1 day ago she bought it			2
if you do n't wan na give it away ( means out of the coutnry ) , then why did they sell it in first place ? ? ? @entity181 , @entity182 , 1 day ago sorry , but @entity2 won the auction and should be able to do anything she wants with the ring			1
the facts are : the @entity7 government , after the auction , refused to let @entity2 take her ring out of the @entity7			1
now if it were me and i put down all that money for a ring i would have sold it for double to whoever could come up with the cash			2
i would have set the price after auction , not just accepted the price i paid			0
this due to the fact that it was my ring , not the @entity7 governments or anyone elses			0
if the @entity7 did n't want the ring to leave the country then the auction should have been limited to @entity7 buyers prior to the auction beginning , but that makes too much sense			0
@entity212 , @entity213 , 1 day ago the money has to be raised to much the price paid , so that the buyer will not lose money			1
this is the same with works of art. relatively recently a @entity221 was going to be bought privately , but money was raised for it to be bought for the nation , and it is now split between the @entity224 and the @entity224 of @entity225			1
this is essentially the same situation			0
i understand that @entity2 has been gracious about what has happened and understands that the ring will exhibited to the public			1
i agree that perhaps a replica could be made for her			0
@entity232 , @entity233 , @entity7 , 1 day ago not @entity235 fault but do agree that national treasures should be kept in their nation			0
should never have been put up for sale to people outside the @entity7			0
@entity240 , australia , @entity242 , 1 day ago load of garbage			0
if miss @entity2 purchased the ring at auction , then the ring is all hers			1
she has every right to take it home			0
who the hell has the nerve to sell off an item and then say " no we want a @entity7 buyer "			0
let her take her ring @entity256 hers ! @entity212 , @entity213 , 1 day ago this is a common situation , although it normally occurs with works of art , not jewellery			2
if could not get an export licence , she will not have to pay for the ring			2
i am glad it is staying in the @entity7			0
ms @entity2 was n't doing anything wrong by bidding , but @entity6 fans will be able to see it at @entity44			1
in private hands , they would not			0
@entity273 , canada , 1 day ago how ridiculous ... if they did n't want it leaving they should n't have offered it for sale ... @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity3 , 1 day ago if the ring was so important ... it should not have been at auction ... next time you should put up big signs that say ( only british can bid at this auction ) ... then the world will see how discrimatory your policies are			0
@entity291 , @entity292 , 1 day ago hypocrites ! this decision was made by the very same people whose museums are filled with treasures " stolen " from all over the world			0
- @entity300 , @entity3 , 23/9/2013 20:36 re. ... ... ... ... ...			0
time for @entity7 to give back all it has stolen ... bunch of hypocrites			0
why was it on sale in the first place ? - @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , 23/9/2013 22:51 any one think ' @entity300 ' and ' @entity310 ' are one and the same ? the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity1			0
