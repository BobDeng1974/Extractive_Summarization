aliens are often portrayed as diminutive beings , but in ‘ reality ’ they could be much larger and heavier than science fiction films suggest			1
scientist @entity4 has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive , based on the laws of conservation of energy seen on @entity10			1
and from this , he calculates that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist they will typically weigh 650lbs ( 300kg ) - the median weight of a polar bear			1
aliens ( illustrated with a stock image ) are often portrayed as diminutive beings , but in ‘ reality ’ they could be much larger , one scientist claims			2
@entity4 from @entity20 applied a mathematical formula to assume aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals on @entity10 mr @entity4 came to this conclusion by applying a mathematical formula that assumes aliens obey the same laws of conservation of energy as animals do on @entity10			2
this means that larger animals need more resources to survive , so are less common than plentiful ants , for example			0
the cosmologist ’s calculations are also based on the idea that there ’s a minimum size needed for intelligent life , but do n’t factor in an alien planet ’s gravity			1
‘ throughout the animal kingdom , species which are physically larger invariably possess a lower population density , possibly due to their enhanced energy demands , ’ he wrote in a paper , published at @entity45			0
he said there must be a minimum body size necessary for supporting intelligent life , based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans , found on @entity10			1
‘ as a result , we should expect humans to be physically smaller than most other advanced species			0
’ ' ... we conclude that most species are expected to exceed 300kg in body mass. the median body mass is similar to that of a polar bear			0
' he claims that just as it is on @entity10 , there are probably more small animals than larger ones in the universe , but that the larger a planet or biosphere the more likely it is to have evolved an intelligent species			2
mr @entity4 said there must be a minimum size necessary for supporting intelligent life , based on the range of body sizes of intelligent animals such as apes and humans , found on @entity10			1
and , if they exist , he believes intelligent aliens typically weigh more than 650 lbs ( 300kg ) - around the size of a polar bear ( stock image ) his argument follows that if clever aliens are large , there may be fewer of them , as they will likely live in a society with low population densities to ensure they have the resources they need			1
study claims aliens are larger than those portrayed in sci - fi ( stock image )			0
but the calculations do n't take into account an alien planet ’s surface gravity commenting on the study , @entity101 , a research fellow at the @entity102 , told @entity104 : ‘ i think the average size calculation is reasonable ’			1
@entity106 , a researcher at the @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109 , added that it is not the first time scientists have suggested that aliens may be large , because big animals tend to live longer			0
a longer lifespan makes creatures potentially more likely to develop knowledge and invent technology needed to make contact with humans one day			0
mr @entity4 continued : ‘ higher intelligence enables the development of technologies which can sustain larger population sizes			2
’ while the research has been described as interesting by @entity125 , he said ‘ there ’s no concrete data to work with ’ and that @entity10 is being used as a model to predict what life looks like elsewhere in the universe – but aliens may be completely different			2
he pointed out that it is humans ’ thumbs , bipedal stance and brains , rather than our bulk , that has enabled us to thrive on @entity10 , so body mass is only one indicator of intelligence			0
‘ polar bears are large but do not write great literature and build radio towers and a lot of that is probably because they are walking around on all fours , ’ he said			0
mr @entity101 also noted that the research does n’t take an alien planet ’s surface gravity into account			1
he explained that planets with stronger gravity might be expected to be home to smaller life forms than those with weaker gravity , which means that the calculation is incomplete .			0

@entity4 said aliens probably weigh more than 650 lbs ( 300kg )
calculations based on idea that there ’s a minimum size for intelligent life
larger aliens are more likely to live long enough to make advanced tech
estimated size does n't factor in evolution or an alien planet *'s* gravity
