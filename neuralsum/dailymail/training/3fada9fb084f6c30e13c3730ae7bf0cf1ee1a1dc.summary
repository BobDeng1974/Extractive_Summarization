by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 3 december 2013 when it comes to winter tights , most of us settle for a 50 - denier pair from @entity6			1
but if you 're looking to inject some serious @entity12 sparkle into your look this december , these stretch - mesh tights embellished with @entity9 crystals were made for you			1
created by @entity15 at @entity16 , they first dazzled on the runway at his autumn / winter13 show			1
would you pay nearly £ 700 for a pair of tights ? @entity16 have unveiled the ludicrously expensive @entity9 pair but all that bling does n't come cheap ; these tights are probably the world ’s most expensive hosiery at a staggering £ 688 a pair			1
made in @entity28 from nylon fishnet , they are very delicate and can only be hand - washed			1
they are already a firm favourite of the fashion pack - just ask @entity33 who wore them in the @entity35 of fashion bible , @entity38 @entity37			1
bling bling : made in @entity28 from nylon fishnet , they are very delicate and can only be hand - washed should you wish to splash out , stylist @entity42 has shared her top tips for pulling off the look			2
she said : ‘ if opulence and indulgence is your thing , then the @entity9 - studded tights will be right up your alley			2
' the semi sheer black tights have been emblazoned with tiny crystal beading , and while i actually adore these and how delicate in style they are - i 'd be hard pushed to spend quite that amount on something more often than not will get ladders			2
' however , if you are splurging , this hosiery is your jewellery and tights all in one			0
keep the outfit simple and team with a chic lbd or black playsuit and blazer			0
' avoid pattern ; these tights will definitely be the talking point of your look			0
just be wary of any nails , sharp objects or basically anything that might snag these ... you may as well walk around with a sign saying " please do n’t touch ! " ’			0
if the tights alone are n't risque enough for you , take note from daring fashionistas @entity78 and @entity80 who have both wore the full see - through bodysuit version recently			0
dare to bare : the see - through bodysuit version of the tights was worn by those shy , demure souls @entity78 and @entity86			0
