by @entity0 four acoustic ' pings ' which were at the centre of the search for missing @entity6 are no longer believed to be from the aircraft 's black box , a @entity2 official has claimed			1
@entity10 search authorities narrowed the search for the jet , which disappeared in march , after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the @entity18 , some 1,600 km off @entity10 's northwest coast			1
but according to @entity21 , the @entity2 's deputy director of ocean engineering , authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders			1
speaking to @entity44 , mr @entity21 said : ‘ our best theory at this point is that ( the pings were ) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the @entity52			0
’ he also said that if the pings had come from the plane ’s flight recorders then searchers would have found them and confirmed other countries agreed with his theory			0
the discovery of the pings on april 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough but no further promising signals were heard before the expiry of the batteries on the black box 's locator beacons			1
a scan of the area around the pings with an unnamed submarine failed to find any sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history			2
authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence , including the loss of communications , suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from @entity86 to @entity87			0
the @entity92 satellite firm 's data helped track @entity6 a scan of the area around the pings failed to find any sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history the @entity2 official ’s claims come just days after underwater scientists said @entity10 prime minister @entity104 's announcement that black box pingers had been found was premature and lacked detailed analysis			1
the acoustic experts , who wished to remain anonymous , said the four critical signals picked up by the pinger locator were almost definitely not from @entity6 ’s black box and agreed they were likely to be from a different man - made source			1
the experts said the signals were detected too far apart to be from the black box and were also the wrong frequency			2
unprecedented : twenty - six nations have been involved in the search for @entity6 since it disappeared the @entity121 team watches on as the @entity122 ( @entity123 ) @entity124 begins a search for @entity6 on 17 april			0
26 nations have been involved in the search for @entity6 since it disappeared more than a month ago ' as soon as i saw the frequency and the distance between the pings i knew it could n’t be the aircraft pinger , ' one of the scientists said			0
the pings had played a key role in shaping the search for the plane , which vanished on a routine flight as it crossed the @entity141			2
@entity10 authorities have not yet commented on the most recent claims about the pings .			0

four acoustic ' pings ' were not from black box and could have been from a ship
@entity2 deputy director said they did not come from jet 's onboard data
@entity155 flight vanished on march 8 with 227 passengers and crew
despite extensive searches , there has been no sign of the @entity18
