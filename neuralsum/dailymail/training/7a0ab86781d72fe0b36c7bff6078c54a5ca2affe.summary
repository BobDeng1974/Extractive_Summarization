by @entity0 general sir @entity1 is the country 's third highest ranking officer one of @entity4 's top generals has branded the planned cuts to the armed forces as ' one hell of a risk '			1
by 2020 , the @entity9 will have been slashed by a fifth - from 102,000 to 82,000 troops - and will be far more reliant on reserves			2
general sir @entity1 , the @entity9 's third most senior officer , has warned that the shifts will make the country far weaker on the world stage			1
in an interview with the @entity16 , the general said defence cuts had ' hollowed out ' the armed forces , particularly the @entity18 , which has been ' cut to the bone ' and left unable to take part in @entity22 maritime operations			1
sir @entity1 , who is leaving the @entity9 is august , said the ' jury is out still ' on plans to make up for smaller standing forces by expanding the @entity9 - formerly the @entity9 - from 19,000 to 30,000 troops			1
he said it would need a ' complete shift in culture ' and support from the wider public and employers if it is to succeed , saying : ' the nation needs to get behind this			0
it 's not just the armed forces - this is everybody 's business			2
' the general stepped down as @entity22 's deputy supreme commander on friday , a role in which he was coordinating the organisation 's response to @entity46 's takeover of the @entity47			1
he said @entity46 aggression made it more important for the @entity4 to protect its defence budget , even if that meant other departments suffered			1
the general claimed countries must protect defence budgets to deter @entity56 from further aggression he said : ' we all support the efforts to get the deficit down but it is all about priorities			1
what really matters ? well , the first duty of government is to protect the nation			0
defence is really , really important			0
sir @entity1 with @entity69 in 2006			2
the general has warned that cuts are undermining the country 's armed forces ' and the electorate need to understand there is no point in having hospitals and schools and welfare unless the country is safe			1
' sir @entity1 admitted that those implementing the changes had ' made a pretty good fist of a very difficult hand of cards ' , but said : ' i would n't want to let anybody think that i think that @entity88 is good news , it 's not			2
' the sort of defence cuts we have seen ... have really hollowed out the @entity4 armed forces and i think that people need to sit up and recognise that			1
' the general claimed the changes to the @entity18 were the most pressing concern , as they has left the @entity4 without an operational aircraft carrier until 2020 and a fleet of just 19 frigates and destroyers			0
he said : ' a hollowed - out navy means you ca n't project power			0
i 've heard this said in the @entity107 : " the yardstick by which we measure ourselves is our ability to punch above our weight "			0
you ca n't do that now			0
by that yardstick , therefore , we 're failing			0
' the @entity115 this week said the crisis in @entity117 underlined the continuing threat of state - on - state conflict , warning that @entity4 's national security depended upon its ability to maintain a ' credible deterrent ' against a full range threats from cyber attack to a nuclear strike			0
further reductions in the size of the @entity4 's conventional forces could ultimately call into question the effectiveness of the @entity133 nuclear deterrent , it said .			0

general sir @entity1 said armed forces are being undermined by cuts
former @entity22 commander said countries must protect defence budgets in order to deter further @entity46 aggression after takeover of @entity47
he said *deeper* cuts should be *focussed* on other departments so @entity9 can be *spared*
