@entity0 has found that he 's fallen out of favor with residents in the small farming town of @entity4 with past @entity6 roles including mobsters , criminals and villains , @entity0 is no stranger to playing the baddie			1
but the actor is probably not so happy to be cast in this most recent villainous role - in a real - life small - town tax dispute			0
@entity0 has found that he 's fallen out of favor with residents in the small farming town of @entity4 in @entity17 in a quarrel over a property tax bill			1
the conflict centers on @entity0 's 78 - acre homestead , which was bought by the actor 's @entity22 in 1997 for $ 1.5 million			1
since then a fresh valuation from assessors in @entity4 has put the worth of the property at $ 6 million , which - if it is allowed to stand - would mean the @entity22 owes the town $ 170,000			1
but the trust has challenged the valuation , leading to an extended legal battle that has left the tiny town with debts totaling more than $ 100,000			1
it is not clear whether @entity0 sanctioned the legal challenge , but it has not made the actor popular among residents in the small farming community of around 5,800 people			1
according to the @entity42 , when @entity0 's trust acquired the property in 1997 , it included an 18th - century wood - frame farmhouse and two outbuildings with a total of six bedrooms and seven baths			1
the @entity22 has since added 20 acres			2
a barn was turned into a 14,000 - square - foot recreation center with a game room , gym , basketball court , swimming pool , steam room , sauna - and boxing ring and small film studio			0
another barn was turned into a workshop and one was built as an office			0
there are also two guesthouses on the property , as well as a tennis court and a small ski slope			0
the trust 's assessor valued the property - which sits about 75 miles north of @entity70 - at $ 4 million			2
justice @entity71 of @entity72 in @entity73 sided with the town at the trial			0
' the defining characteristics of the subject property are privacy and self - sufficiency , which would appeal to buyers seeking property in a wide range of areas outside @entity84 , ' she wrote in her decision in june			0
the town offered a settlement for slightly less than its $ 6 million assessment but the @entity22 rejected it and filed an appeal			1
it could save $ 57,000 a year if the legal challenge succeeds			2
' he took his stand , which is his right , we all agree with that , ' @entity92 , a former film producer now in his fourth term as @entity4 town supervisor , told the @entity42			2
@entity4 in @entity17 has around 5,800 residents			0
it is home to @entity0 's 78 - acre property ' now it 's like , ' i can afford this fight , so i 'm going to dig my heels in '			1
' the @entity106 feels it is worth resisting the trust 's challenge at present , but there are fears that the legal debts will continue to mount for the tiny town			1
' what if he wins , or we give up ? then everybody else has to pick up the slack , ' added @entity119 , a member of the board			0
' but can we afford to keep fighting , either ? ' @entity0 ( pictured here in 1995 film @entity123 ) is no stranger to playing the baddie			0
but the actor is probably not so happy to be cast in this most recent villainous role - in a real - life small - town tax dispute some @entity4 residents remain sympathetic to @entity0 , acknowledging that he has employed dozens of local residents to build and maintain his considerable property , and saying that he is acting the part of any taxpayer			1
@entity135 , the chairman of the @entity136 , told the @entity42 that he felt taxes were too high for everyone			0
but he added that @entity0 may well have lost a lot of supporters when the trust challenged the original decision			2
' people can work their whole lives and not make even close to what he spent on this place , ' mr. @entity135 said			0
' it 's difficult for us to feel for him			0
