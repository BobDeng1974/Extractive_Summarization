published : 05:44 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 10:29 est , 27 september 2013 a thrill - seeker has become the first person to be fined for ' tombstoning ' off a notorious bridge where a 22 - year - old died last year			1
@entity5 , 24 , was spotted jumping several times from the 30ft - high @entity7 in @entity8			1
he was fined £ 170 after admitting breaching a local bylaw , and officers said his prosecution was the first of its kind in the county			2
it is the same spot where @entity16 , 22 , of @entity17 , died in july last year			1
taking action : a court in @entity8 has issued its first fine to a tombstoner who was repeatedly jumping from a bridge where a young man died last year @entity7 is notoriously dangerous because there is only a small area of deep water to jump in to from the bridge in @entity29			1
the 14th century bridge has been used for decades by people ‘ tombstoning ’ into the @entity32 , but after several injuries over the years , signs have been erected warning people not to			1
fatal spot : it is the same spot where @entity16 , 22 , of @entity17 , died in july last year police said that the hot summer this year had led to an increase in people jumping , despite mr @entity16 ’s death last year			1
@entity5 , of @entity43 , @entity44 , was fined after pleading guilty at @entity45 ’ court for the offence			1
two other men , both from @entity49 , @entity50 ( aged 24 and 33 ) , are also in the process of being prosecuted			2
inspector @entity52 said : ' it is simply crass stupidity to jump from @entity7			2
' there are a number of risks associated with jumping off a bridge including hitting rocks , misjudging the depth of water and sudden immersion in cold water			0
' this prosecution is the first one i am aware of and certainly the first one in relation to @entity7			1
' we have actually seen an increase in people jumping this year , because of the hot weather			0
' he said that @entity5 was prosecuted when a local councillor spotted him repeatedly jumping from the bridge in august			1
the police were called and @entity5 was pointed out to officers			2
he was issued with a court summons and pleaded guilty to breaching the bylaw			0
inspector @entity52 said : ' there is a problem at the bridge because thrill seekers say that you should be able to do what you want and that the police are being party - poopers			0
' but it is very dangerous to jump there			0
we have to think of the consequences and the impact that jumping has had on the family of the man who died there last year			2
@entity7 has been a popular tombstoning spot for decades taking action : after numerous incidents , the local council put up signs banning people from jumping off the bridge in line with a byelaw ' this fine shows we do take this activity very seriously , and work closely with @entity107 to tackle the dangers			1
if someone jumping is reported to us we will attend and take further action as appropriate			0
' however , the responsibility for keeping each other safe falls on the entire community			0
police can not be there all the time and we encourage members of the public to either report anyone seen jumping , or to speak to them and advise them of the risks in jumping			0
' there is also personal responsibility people need to take to protect their own health and safety			0
it is an incredibly dangerous activity and i would ask anyone who is considering jumping to think about the risks and effects it will have on family should anything untoward happen			2
the warning has n't prevented thrill - seekers from continuing to launch themselves from the bridge into the river where they must aim for a small deeper channel during the hot summer , the adrenaline - pumping past - time has attracted young thrill - seekers and spectators to the river ' jumping from the bridge is particularly common during the summer months , and we will continue to work with the local community next summer to reiterate the dangers			1
' @entity150 , neighbourhood enforcement officer for @entity107 , said : ' the fine imposed on the male who contravened the @entity107 byelaw that prohibits jumping off @entity7 into the @entity32 was a direct result of a joint enforcement operation carried out by @entity157 and @entity158 during the summer of 2013			1
' the prosecution sends out a clear message that @entity107 and @entity158 will not tolerate the irresponsible actions of members of the public who contravene the byelaw and risk death or serious injury by jumping off the bridge			2
' tombstoning is also popular among youngsters in @entity168 a spokesman for @entity170 and @entity171 told the @entity172 he was not aware of any fines issued for tombstoning , and officers would advise against it as opposed to prosecute a spokesman for the @entity178 said : ' jumping from piers , cliffs , rocks or other structures into the sea can be very dangerous			1
' what was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by tea - time due to tidal conditions - and you do n't know what other hazards might be under the surface			0
' in the past eight years , this perilous pursuit has claimed the lives of 20 people and left more than 60 seriously injured , according to the @entity178			0
these figures include two suspected tombstoning incidents last year , where @entity16 , 22 , died after jumping into the @entity32 from the 40ft - high @entity7 at @entity29 in @entity8			1
a few days later 15 - year - old @entity198 drowned after he was swept away by strong currents as him as his friends tombstoned off a 20ft - high bridge over the @entity203 at @entity204 near @entity205 , @entity206			0
