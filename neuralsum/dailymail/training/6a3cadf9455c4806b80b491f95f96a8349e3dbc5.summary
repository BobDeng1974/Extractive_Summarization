by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 27 september 2013 it may look more like a @entity3 attraction than a place you would actually live			0
but , believe it or not , this topsy - turvy piece of work is actually a hotel in @entity10 , known locally as @entity11			1
designed by eccentric architect @entity14 , and described by some as ' expressionist ' , the bizarre building in @entity13 is covered in bizarre wooden sculpture , features a life - size model tiger to leer at guests , and contains no square windows			1
crazy : the bizarre structure rises several stories above the buildings around it , and from this angle looks like a kind of convoluted tree stump wild : this inner area of the house features railings painted to look like giraffe skin and trees growing out of the house 's roof uneven : the rooms inside feature mismatched furniture made from tree stumps , and have undulating ceilings			1
this room also has a tiger with glowing , red eyes all natural : the house is decorated with bizarre wooden features , such as this textured wall ( left ) and a wooden staircase ( right ) , which appears to have been cut straight from a tree trunk officially known as @entity50 , the house , still a work in progress , has been expanding steadily since it was begun in 1990 by ms @entity14			1
it was converted into a hotel , where rooms are available for around Â£ 40 a night , as a way of dealing with the huge losses it incurred			2
it now attracts 90,000 visitors a year			0
it contains ten rooms , each of which are themed after a different animal , including the ant , tiger , kangaroo and bear			0
at first it caused quite a stir with the locals , but they have since grown to appreciate the odd construction			0
attraction : the @entity77 , which welcomed 90,000 people last year , can command a sizable audience eccentric : the steeply - slanted roof of this portion of the house is just one of its out - of - the - ordinary features what lies within : all the doorways in the house are an unusual shape , and wood and sculpted concrete interweave in the walls business manager @entity92 , 38 , said : ' at the beginning most of people did not accept @entity77 because it was too abnormal , odd , and strange			1
' gradually people understand it more , little by little			2
' now @entity77 has become acceptable , and is a place that attracts tourists from many other countries			0
' ms @entity14 , who is said to draw paintings of her ideas then give them to local craftsmen to make a reality , said the design of the house is aobut bringing people back in touch with nature			1
leafy : ms @entity14 , the architect , says she wants the house to bring people and nature closer together @entity112 : @entity113 used as part of the structure and trees which grow free around the house are almost indistinguishable ornate : the house , which seems to look different from every angle , has a rich mixture of features and styles she said : ' although i was trained in the mainstream of architecture , i wanted to step out of it , and feel i did so when i created @entity50			1
' since the end of the last century till now , nature and the environment have been destroyed			0
' i would like to bring people back to nature to be more friendly with it and to love it			2
' i do not just want them to make full use of it then destroy it , as people in many places of the world including @entity10 have been doing			0
' everyone aspires for independence and freedom and through the @entity77 i want to realise my dreams of independence and freedom in the art of architecture			0

the @entity50 in @entity13 was built in 1990 in a bizarre style
it is known locally as @entity11 , and is a functioning hotel
the architect @entity14 says she wants the house to help people *reconnect* with nature
