@entity0 will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘ lead the @entity2 ’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor - made for a power - sharing deal with @entity6			1
the @entity8 leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for @entity2 foreign policy , welfare payments , energy bills and @entity15 university tuition fees			1
several of her election pledges overlap with @entity6 policy , including slashing tuition fees in @entity15 from a maximum of £ 9,000 a year to £ 6,000 , and rolling back competition in the @entity21			1
others are calculated to drag a minority @entity6 government to the left , including halting the roll - out of @entity28 ’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the @entity31 nuclear weapons system			1
at the heart of the @entity8 ’s manifesto are plans for what @entity41 has called ‘ modest ’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £ 180billion over five years			2
@entity62 ’s first minister , who is not herself running for a @entity64 seat , said yesterday the @entity8 had much in common with left - wing @entity65 and aimed to build a ‘ progressive alliance ’ for people ‘ right across the @entity2 ’			1
‘ there is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies			0
it is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity , ’ she told the @entity70 ’s @entity69			0
today ’s @entity8 election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny			1
polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border , winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at @entity64			0
that could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election , when @entity91 surged and ended up with more than 70 seats			0
in the years that followed , there was bitter conflict and the larger part of @entity97 eventually seceded from the @entity2			2
the huge surge in support for the @entity8 could see senior @entity6 figures such as @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 ( right ) lose their seats the latest @entity62 - wide @entity105 survey shows the @entity8 on a record 49 per cent , up three , with @entity6 trailing on 25 per cent , down four			1
the conservatives were on 18 per cent and @entity108 on just four per cent			0
the scale of the shift in traditional @entity6 strongholds in @entity62 is unprecedented in modern @entity113 politics			2
even senior @entity6 figures , including the @entity6 leader @entity101 and the shadow foreign secretary and the party ’s election campaign coordinator , @entity102 , are facing defeat			1
the @entity8 will declare today that a ‘ strong team ’ of @entity121 in @entity64 would help ‘ rebalance the @entity2 - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the @entity123 , which has harmed the overall @entity2 economy and left regions of @entity15 neglected ’			1
miss @entity0 insisted those who had asked @entity62 to remain in the @entity2 in last year ’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at @entity64			2
‘ we were told by leaders of the no campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that @entity62 ’s voice really mattered			0
indeed , we were told that @entity62 should n’t leave the @entity2 but lead the @entity2 , ’ she said			2
‘ so it is more than a bit rich , now that @entity62 has decided to remain part of the @entity64 system , for anyone in @entity141 or elsewhere to try and imply that @entity62 ’s voice should n’t be heard or that @entity62 ’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of @entity8 mps			0
’ however , the first minister will face tough questions at today ’s launch over her plans for ‘ full fiscal autonomy ’ or effective ‘ home rule ’ , which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to @entity156			0
it would end the generous @entity158 that funds @entity62			0
the @entity159 has predicted that a ‘ fiscally autonomous ’ @entity62 would have a £ 7.6billion black hole in its finances .			0

@entity0 will today unveil @entity8 manifesto as a ' bid to lead the @entity2 '
several of her party 's election pledges will overlap with @entity6 policies
others are calculated to drag a minority @entity173 government to the left
these include cancelling @entity31 and halting @entity34 changes to benefits
