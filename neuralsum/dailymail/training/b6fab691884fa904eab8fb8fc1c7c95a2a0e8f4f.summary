by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 10:05 est , 29 january 2014 from the invention of the telephone to the bicycle and even the steam ship , the @entity3 period saw a mini revolution in the field of science and technology			0
but of all the new gadgets invented during her reign , it was the camera that delighted queen @entity16 the most			1
by the time she died in 1901 , the @entity19 's first modern monarch had amassed a huge collection of more than 20,000 images that included everything from favourite landscapes to early war photography and touching snaps of pets , friends and children			1
family portrait : queen @entity16 and five of her children in an intimate snap taken by @entity34 in 1854 the @entity35 at home : an 1857 portrait of the @entity35 taken by @entity38 in 1857 now some of the rarely seen photos from her archive are to be included in a fascinating new exhibition that documents queen @entity16 's passion for photography and offers a glimpse of the @entity47 ' family photo album			1
although most of the photos remain in the @entity51 archive , 200 royal photos will appear at the @entity52 in @entity53 , including many by early greats such as @entity34 , @entity38 and @entity55			2
among them is a touching family portrait featuring @entity17 @entity16 and five of her nine children ; the princess royal , the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and prince @entity64 , taken in january 1852			1
more show the @entity17 relaxing at @entity65 , spending time with her husband , @entity67 , or posing for formal portraits during her widowhood			1

another , more intimate snap shows @entity72 and @entity73 in matching tartan ensembles in the garden at @entity65 during a summer jaunt			2
but although family photos dominate , the @entity17 's interest in photography was n't limited to pictures of her husband and children			1
photos of some of the royal palaces , among them @entity51 and @entity103 , appear as do snaps documenting some of the most important events of the @entity3 period			2
one , by @entity107 , shows @entity108 under construction in @entity110 in 1844 , while another chronicles the launch of the pioneering steamship , the @entity114 , under the watchful eye of its designer @entity118			0
favourite palace : this photo , dating from the 1880s , shows the @entity122 at @entity51 @entity123 : this shot of @entity108 was taken by @entity107 , the inventor of the camera poignantly , another , snapped by court favourite @entity34 , shows the aftermath of the @entity129 during the @entity130			2
considered one of the first war photographers , @entity34 travelled to the @entity133 under the patronage of @entity67 and returned with 350 images , among them harrowing shots showing the carnage created by the @entity138 and the @entity139			2
his famous photo , @entity141 , depicting the spot where the @entity129 met its end is part of @entity16 's collection , along with others documenting events such as the @entity148 from around the @entity149			1
although a keen collector , queen @entity16 never took any photographs of her own , although her children all embraced the medium			1
but although she chose not to get involved in creating her own images , her penchant for collecting photos , as the new exhibition makes plain , helped preserve some of the most striking depictions of the @entity3 period for future generations to enjoy			2
a royal passion : queen @entity16 and @entity162 opens at the @entity52 in @entity53 on 4th february			1
see getty.edu for more information innovation : @entity118 watching the launch of the steamship , @entity114 , in 1857 @entity167 : the cannonball littered aftermath of the @entity129 , 1855 from the @entity138 to the @entity129 , @entity34 's striking shots taken in the @entity133 are among the first war photographs ever taken			0
so who was the world 's first war photographer ? born into a wealthy @entity176 family , @entity34 was the fourth of seven children			0
he graduated with a degree in @entity180 , maths , @entity182 and @entity183 from @entity184 in 1840 and planned to study law before giving it up in favour of fine art. after stints in @entity193 , in the studio of @entity190 and at the @entity191 , he returned to @entity194 just in time for the @entity195 where he discovered photography			0
taught by early pioneer , @entity199 , within a year , @entity34 was exhibiting his work nationwide and across @entity201 , and in 1853 , helped found what would become the @entity203 under the patronage of @entity67			0
but it was n't until war broke out in october 1853 between the @entity19 , @entity208 and @entity209 empires on one side , and the @entity149 on the other , that the photos that would define him in later years were taken			0
encouraged by @entity67 , he travelled to the @entity133 , ostensibly to create photographs that would swing public opinion in favour of the unpopular war and counteract the critical reports being sent home by the @entity220 ' @entity219			0
based in the @entity133 for just under 18 months , the 350 images he took are among the most enduring portraits of the @entity130 but did little to counter the negative public reaction			1
much to his annoyance , when they went on sale following his return , the prints proved just as unpopular as the war itself with the paying public			0
his later career was spent travelling the length and breadth of the @entity19 , creating stunning landscape photographs that proved far more commercially successful			0
in 1859 , at his home in @entity237 in @entity238 , @entity34 died after a week - long illness			0
he was just 50 years old .			0
