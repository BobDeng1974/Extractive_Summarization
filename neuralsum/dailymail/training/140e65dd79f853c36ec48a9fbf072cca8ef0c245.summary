by @entity0 last updated at 9:19 am on 28th september 2011 @entity1 died on 10 july 2010 , aged 37 , after a six - hour stand - off with police firearms officers who shot crazed gunman @entity1 with an untried , untested and unapproved @entity5 were yesterday cleared of any wrong - doing			1
@entity1 , 37 , deliberately pulled the trigger of his sawn - off shotgun at the end of a tense six - hour stand - off with police last july after one of the @entity5 rounds struck his arm , an inquest jury found			1
the gunman , who had been on the run for seven days , had been cornered by firearms officers on the banks of the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
but the jury returned a suicide verdict yesterday , concluding there was no evidence to suggest the 500 - volt @entity24 round which hit his arm caused him to inadvertently pull the trigger			1
although @entity1 momentarily rocked backwards after being hit with the @entity5 – prompting him to cry out in pain – he instantly resumed his position , pressed the gun back to his temple and defiantly pulled the trigger			1
@entity32 , representing @entity33 during the £ 1million , three - week inquest , said he hoped the jury ’s findings would finally ‘ lay to rest ’ the ‘ ill - informed ’ criticism that had previously emerged over the use of the @entity5			1
meanwhile an investigation by the @entity40 cleared the officers of misconduct			1
but the watchdog noted that they had not received any proper training before being handed the weapon			2
cleared of wrongdoing : police during their confrontation with fugitive @entity1 bystanders and children take photographs at @entity52 in @entity53 , after the funeral of @entity1 and questions will remain over the deployment of a weapon which has now been withdrawn from use by the @entity59			2
it was the first , and last , time the @entity24 has ever been used in the @entity61 , the inquest heard			2
dubbed the ‘ super taser ’ , the @entity62 has a range five times longer than the conventional version and delivers a shock lasting 20 seconds , four times longer than the those currently in use			2
1 @entity1 warned his girlfriend , @entity1 , he would ' go crazy ' after she split up with him 2 police found a noose and six suicide notes in his @entity74 home in @entity53 , when it was raided 3 he told police negotiators he got so hungry he ate dead mice while living rough around @entity17 , @entity18 4 at the climax of the stand - off with police , @entity1 moved his sawn - off shotgun from under his chin to his right temple , causing police to believe he was about to kill himself 5 the @entity5 round which hit him on the arm probably only caused a small electrical discharge , if it did at all , and it did not penetrate his skin 6 being shot by a taser did not cause him to accidentally pull the trigger of his sawn - off shotgun , according to an expert on the effects of electrical pulses on the nervous system 7 witnesses said there was a gap of up to two seconds between @entity1 being hit by the @entity5 and him pulling the trigger8 @entity88 shotgun cartridges fired from @entity101 shotguns are ' conceptually ' sound but in tests failed to work ' more often than not ' , according to the @entity59 @entity104 's heart was still beating when he arrived at @entity105 , despite a brain injury that was non-survivable 10 a 1cm ball bearing , believed to be the bullet which killed @entity1 , fell on to the hospital floor after medics stopped operating - it had probably lodged in the hood of his top last night @entity1 ’s half - brother @entity114 , 41 , said he still believed using it was a ‘ mistake ’			1
he also criticised the way the inquest was set up			2
‘ a coroner ’s inquest is intended to be non-adversarial , however at times it has felt like this inquest has been a three against one contest , ’ he said			2
‘ barristers representing @entity33 , @entity124 [ which supplied the @entity5 ] and individual @entity126 officers were all pushing in one direction to justify police tactics and strategy			0
‘ the only opposition was legal representation for my family			0
’ @entity1 , who had been released from prison just 48 hours before his shooting rampage in july last year , critically wounded his ex-girlfriend @entity1 , 23 , and killed her new lover , 29 - year - old @entity136			1
he also blinded pc @entity1 , 43 , who was blasted twice as he sat defenceless in his traffic car at a roundabout			0
after @entity1 was cornered on july 9 , negotiators attempted to persuade him to give himself up , but in the early hours of the following day he made a ‘ deliberate ’ movement with the gun , the inquest was told			0
it was then that two firearms officers from @entity146 – working as part of an operation led by @entity33 – fired a round from the controversial @entity150 , which had not been approved by the @entity59			0
the inquest jury of five women and five men concluded the use of the @entity62 was ‘ appropriate ’			0
the jury said that after @entity1 was struck : ‘ the gun momentarily moved away from his head			0
‘ mr @entity1 corrected himself to his original position and repositioned the gun to his temple			0
mr @entity1 then discharged the gun and shot himself			0
’ meanwhile the @entity40 report concluded that there was no evidence officers were guilty of misconduct			1
last night @entity169 police chief constable @entity168 said : ‘ our use of the @entity62 shot gun @entity5 was carefully considered			0
there were simply no other options available to us to stop @entity1 from taking his own life			0

despite the fast - moving events @entity40 ruled that the force *displayed* a ' clear rationale '
