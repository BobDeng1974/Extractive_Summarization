a chance encounter has led to a lifetime 's work for two @entity4 brothers , who are dedicated to helping a @entity6 orphanage			1
the brothers first got involved with the center when @entity10 graduate @entity9 decided to miss his flight home so he could work at the children 's home			1
before long , @entity9 had become managing director , and his brother @entity15 had joined him in trying to increase funding for the 30 youngsters , many of whom lost parents to @entity21 and @entity22			1
the delightful video shows the children crowding around the brothers , laughing and smiling as they are thrown into the air or spun around , and dancing in the yard			2
the video was released as part of a campaign to try to raise $ 12,000 for charity @entity45 to keep the orphanage running for another year			0
when political science graduate @entity9 , who studied in @entity48 , first visited it in 2012 , it could barely cover its basic expenses , such as diapers for the babies , or pay for the caregivers			2
@entity9 , who had been visiting his brother who was studying in @entity6 for a semester , saw the challenging circumstances as a chance to do some good			1
he now works full time at the center and his brother @entity15 travels there regularly to help out			1
warm welcome : the children rush to greet @entity29 when he arrives at the orphanage after being away for several months touched : @entity15 walks into the orphanage , surrounded by excitable faces , as his brother @entity9 films laughter : one of the boys who lives at the @entity6 orphanage smiles as he is lifted up fun times : one of the 30 orphans enjoys being spun around in the yard partnerships and strong links were made with the local community and towns back in the @entity4 , and they helped set up the charity @entity45 , which means blessing and is the name many residents refer to @entity9 by			1
as well as raising funds to keep the children clothed , fed and healthy , the charity helps provide them with an education			1
' we bring in six to ten volunteers on a daily basis to tutor them in school			0
we also work to bring counselors from @entity85 to work with the kids , ' @entity15 told @entity87			2
he added that the brothers were also trying to challenge the stereotype of orphans sitting around miserably			0
' every time they talk about orphans , it ’s sad and miserable			0
meanwhile , you get there , and it ’s so much different , ' he said			0
cooling off : @entity15 throws a bucket of water over the children as they play in a paddling pool supper : one of the boys shows off his dinner			2
the @entity9 brothers are trying to raise funds to keep the children healthy and well fed entertainment : the children dance and sing while one of the brothers plays guitar for them devoted : the brothers are keen to make life as good as possible for the children ' it ’s like that every day			1
the kids are so pumped to see you and happy			0
it takes nothing to blow their mind … it ’s a party			0
' @entity45 is currently raising funds to cover the running costs for the next 12 months			1
thanks to the video and a @entity128 site , the brothers have been able to raise awareness - and much - needed funds			0
by tuesday , nearly $ 9,000 had been donated to help pay for the basic necessities			0
the brothers hope that over time other donations can be found to pay for new beds and furniture , and a computer laboratory			0
happiness : the @entity139 say the orphanage is always filled with laughter and fun growing up : the center cares for children of all ages , from babies to teenagers			2

@entity9 started work at @entity6 children 's center in 2012
@entity9 and his brother @entity15 are now raising funds to help the children
