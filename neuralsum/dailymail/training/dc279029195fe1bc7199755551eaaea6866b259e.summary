@entity0 remains confident @entity1 will avoid relegation this season but admits his side must urgently improve their form away from home			1
rangers have taken four points from their opening five @entity10 games but are still winless on their travels after two 4 - 0 thumpings by @entity13 and @entity14 either side of a 1 - 0 loss at @entity17 in the @entity18			1
@entity1 face a tough trip on saturday to high - flying @entity20 , who sit second in the table after an excellent start to the campaign under new boss @entity25			1
@entity0 looks on as his @entity1 side entertained @entity27 last weekend @entity0 ushers instructions to his players after @entity31 's last - gasp equaliser for the @entity1 ' we 've played well at home , our home form has been decent , ' @entity0 said			1
' i thought we played well against @entity36 in the first game , we had a good win against @entity39 and then we got a point against a good @entity27 team - i think they 'll be in the top half again this year			2
' so that 's encouraging but we have to take that away from home now , our two away performances have n't been good enough and we need to improve			0
' @entity0 added : ' we have had two tough away games - we 'll play worse teams than @entity14 and @entity13 away that 's for sure			1
' we 'll be okay , it 's going to be tough , it 's going to be tight but i 'm still confident we 'll be okay come the end of the season			2
' @entity0 is short of midfield options this weekend with @entity54 and @entity55 both unavailable with hamstring injuries and @entity31 also doubtful after picking up a knock against @entity27			1
there may be better news , however , regarding the fitness of @entity61 who appeared to injure his knee while celebrating a goal in training			0
@entity1 face a tough trip to @entity25 's @entity20 this weekend , who have started the season superbly @entity54 went off injured for @entity1 during last weekend 's game against @entity27 at @entity70 the @entity71 has endured a series of knee problems in the past but the midfielder could be back for the trip to @entity77 's			1
' he told me that 's not when he did it but i saw him and i thought that 's when he did it when he slid on his knees celebrating , ' @entity0 said			2
' it should n't happen too often anyway because he 's not a goalscorer			0
' i was worried when he first did it , you fear the worst , but it looks like he 's okay so that 's good			0
' another bizarre off - the - field incident saw @entity92 defender @entity91 wrongfully arrested for stealing cheese from a supermarket this week but @entity0 said he was in the dark over the issue			1
@entity91 looks set to start on saturday and he will need to be at his best to contain a @entity20 side that has scored eight goals in their last three league matches			2
' we 're only five games in but at the moment they 're looking the real deal , ' @entity0 said			0
' it 's been fantastic what they 've done , amazing really			0
' when they lost all those players in the summer i think people thought that was the end of @entity20 and that they 'd be on the slide but @entity25 has done an amazing job there			0
' they play some good football , they 've got good players - good young players coming through again as usual			0
' @entity0 , who left @entity20 to return to their bitter rivals @entity116 in december 2005 , added : ' i always get a bit of grief down there			2
' i think we went there and won last time and it was on my birthday so that was a good birthday present - let 's hope we go and get a win there this time			0

the @entity92 manager remains confident @entity1 will stay up this season despite a poor run of form on the road
@entity0 's side have suffered back - to - back 4 - 0 defeats at both @entity13 and @entity14 in the league
the *67* - year - old confirms @entity54 and @entity55 will miss the trip to @entity20 on saturday *due* to hamstring injuries
