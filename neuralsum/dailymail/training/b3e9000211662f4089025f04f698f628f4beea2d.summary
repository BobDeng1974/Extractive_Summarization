a new @entity1 study has revealed homeopathic medicines are no more effective than a placebo homeopathy is no more effective than a placebo , a national medical agency has concluded in a hard - hitting report			1
@entity9 ’s @entity8 ( @entity8 ) analysed research into the effectiveness of alternative medicines on 68 health conditions and found ‘ there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective ’ on any of them			1
the review , conducted by a working committee of medical experts , said homeopathy had no impact on a range of conditions including asthma , arthritis , sleep disturbances , cold and flu , chronic fatigue syndrome , eczema , cholera , burns , malaria and heroin addiction			1
the authors of the report said : ‘ no good - quality , well - designed studies with enough participants for a meaningful result reported either that homeopathy caused greater health improvements than a substance with no effect on the health condition [ placebo ] , or that homeopathy caused health improvements equal to those of another treatment			1
’ they went on to dismiss anecdotal support for the effectiveness of homeopathy , and urged health professionals to take account of scientific evidence when informing patients			1
‘ it is not possible to tell whether a health treatment is effective or not simply by considering individuals ’ experiences or healthcare practitioners ’ beliefs , ’ they said			2
homeopathy is a complementary medicine , the central principle of which is that ‘ like cures like ’ – that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove them in tiny doses			1
in @entity70 there are several @entity72 homeopathic hospitals and some gp practices offer the treatment but it is not widely available			0
the report prompted medical professionals to call for governments to stop legitimising homeopathy			2
professor @entity80 , an immunologist and emeritus professor of medicine at the @entity82 , told @entity83 the report was long overdue and said homeopathic treatments should now be ‘ put away ’ once and for all			0
@entity9 's @entity8 analysed research into the effectiveness of alternative medicines on 68 different conditions , and found ' there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective ' on any of them he said : ‘ obviously we understand the placebo effect			1
we know that many people have illnesses that are short lived by its very nature and their bodies will cure them , so it ’s very easy for people to fall in trap that because they did @entity104 , @entity103 follows			0
’ he added he did not think it ethical to prescribe a placebo			0
dr @entity107 , @entity9 president of the @entity108 , also welcomed the report and said his organisation has long held there is no evidence to support homeopathy			2
‘ homeopathy is not a science			0
it is not based in science , ’ he said			0
‘ in a lot of cases it can be considered dangerous and can risk people ’s lives , ’ said dr @entity107			0
submissions from homeopathy interest groups and the public were among the studies assessed by the @entity8 , but did not alter the conclusions of the @entity129 , in some cases due to the poor quality of the studies submitted .			0

@entity1 team looked at the impact of homeopathy on conditions including asthma , arthritis , sleep disturbances , cold and flu and eczema
study found ' no reliable evidence ' homeopathy was effective on any illness
homeopathy is a *complimentary* medicine , which works on the principle of ' like cures like ' - a substance that causes symptoms can help remove them
