the pilot of doomed flight @entity2 was distraught over his wife ’s decision to move out of their family home and could have taken the plane for a ‘ last joyride ’ before it crashed into the southern @entity10 killing all 239 people on board , says a long - time friend of the pilot			1
the friend , also a pilot , said captain @entity16 had been left rattled by his family problems , and did n’t appear to be in the right state of mind to be flying			1
he warned that it was ‘ very possible that neither the passengers nor the other crew on - board knew what was happening until it was too late ’			1
‘ he 's one of the finest pilots around and i 'm no medical expert , but with all that was happening in his life @entity16 was probably in no state of mind to be flying , ’ he told the @entity24 on the condition of anonymity			1
he said his friend 's relationships were breaking down , and while @entity16 was involved with another woman he was still devastated at his wife 's decision to move out of their family home			1
he said the troubled pilot could have seen @entity2 as an opportunity to try high - risk maneuvers he 'd perfected on his beloved flight simulator			2
these shocking new claims follow reports that flight mh370 climbed to between 43,000 and 45,000ft shortly after the last voice communication from the cockpit of the plane			2
devastated : a relative of the @entity70 passengers aboard @entity16 grieves after being told the flight ended in southern @entity10 mourning : high school students hold candles during a vigil for passengers of the missing @entity2 in @entity76 , @entity70 the worst news : @entity78 , daughter of the @entity80 couple @entity79 and @entity81 , shows pictures of her parents who were passengers on the missing plane an aviation industry source , who wished to remain anonymous , told @entity87 : ' it was tracked flying at this altitude for 23 minutes before descending			1
@entity89 would have run out in 12 minutes [ in a depressurised cabin ] , rendering the passengers unconscious			1
' the 777 - 200er @entity94 aircraft used on the ill - fated flight has a maximum service ceiling of 43,000 feet and can very probably fly safely at even greater heights , one expert said			0
but at this altitude , where the atmosphere drastically thins , it would take mere minutes if not seconds for hypoxia - a lack of oxygen - to set in if the cabin was manually depressurised by one of the pilots , as seen in the below video of a high - altitude experiment			2
oxygen masks would have dropped down , but these only supply between five and 10 minutes of gas			0
@entity113 's head of aviation , @entity112 , told @entity87 that a drop in cabin pressure that had knocked out passengers and crew would mean the plane would fly on unmanned until eventually running out of fuel and crashing into ocean			2
‘ you ’d just slowly pass out			0
but it would have no effect on the plane at all , ’ he said			0
‘ the plane would just keep going until it eventually ran out of fuel			2
‘ that would explain it all			0
that plane flew on a very long time , all the way from @entity132 to near the west coast of @entity134			0
’ crew onboard @entity137 line the decks as the ship makes a turn after a potential sighting was reported in the search for the missing plane rough seas : crews were forced to abandon the search due to harsh weather , but are now back in the target area the passengers ' devastated families are expected to start arriving in @entity151 as soon as the debris is confirmed as belonging to @entity2 , with the @entity153 announcing it would set up a special facility to assist them , as well as waive any visa fees			1
a spokeswoman for the city 's @entity158 and @entity160 told @entity87 she had been inundated with phone calls from people who were willing to accommodate the families of the flight 's 139 @entity70 passengers			0
' we 've received many offers from the public who are volunteering to provide accommodation , ' the spokeswoman said			0
a long way to go : today 's search area was split into three areas , with 12 aircraft leading the recovery operation aerial search : the view from the flight deck of an @entity179 aircraft over the southern @entity10 brutal conditions : crew on - board @entity137 are battling monster swells and high wind in their search for signs of @entity2 brutal conditions : crew on - board @entity137 are battling monster swells and high wind in their search for signs of @entity2 the @entity134 - led international search teams today continued their painstaking mission to locate and retrieve debris from @entity2 in a target area that began some 2,500kms off @entity134 's west coast , but has slowly moved closer to the mainland			1
efforts are now being focused on an area that begins around 2,000kms from shore			0
after being forced to abandon yesterday 's search due to dangerous weather , the @entity137 has now returned to the target area in an effort to locate and retrieve debris			0
today 's search is focusing on three areas and 12 aircraft - seven military and five civilian planes - have led the operation , which @entity134 prime minister @entity206 described as ' very logistically difficult '			1
mr @entity206 also warned that the search could n't continue indefinitely			1
' we are just going to keep on looking because we owe it to people to do everything we can to resolve this riddle , ' he told the @entity213			0
' it is not absolutely open - ended but it is not something we will lightly abandon			0
