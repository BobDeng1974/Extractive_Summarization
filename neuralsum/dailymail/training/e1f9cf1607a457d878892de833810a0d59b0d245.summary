@entity12 , a unit of @entity196 's @entity137 , is the distributor of ' @entity131 , ' a forthcoming comedy featuring a plot to assassinate @entity2 leader @entity99			1
@entity2 has described the film as an ' act of war '			2
last year , more than 30,000 pcs at @entity114 banks and broadcasting companies were hit by a similar attack that cybersecurity researchers widely believe was launched from @entity2			1
months later , the @entity114 government 's online presence was targeted , with the president 's website defaced with a banner reading ' long live general @entity99 , president of reunification !

' a movie theater worker sweeps rain water under a poster for the movie @entity131 at the @entity283 12 movie theater in @entity284 , @entity285 the fallout from the @entity12 hack that began four weeks ago exploded tuesday after the shadowy group calling themselves @entity231 escalated their attack beyond corporate espionage and threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 @entity137 has said it stands by the makers of @entity131 , a comedy about two journalists - @entity297 and @entity222 - recruited by the @entity298 to assassinate @entity2 leader @entity99 neither attack was particularly sophisticated , but @entity114 authorities said @entity2 was to blame , even though ' hacktivist ' groups - online activists who hack high - profile targets in order to spread political messages - first appeared to claim responsibility			1
those attacks used rudimentary but effective malware which security researchers later dubbed @entity310			0
also known as the @entity311 , the hackers have been involved in a five - year spree against @entity114 targets , according to a report last year by computer security firm @entity316 , which estimated the group included 10 to 50 hackers and described it as ' unique ' in its ability to carry out high - profile and damaging attacks over several years			1
some security experts have cast doubt on @entity2 involvement in the attack on @entity137 , citing the publicity - seeking hacktivist style of the attacks			1
however , the use of an unknown name by the group behind the @entity137 attacks , ' @entity231 ' , is similar to previous attacks by the @entity310 gang			2
it remains unclear if the @entity310 gang are outsiders working on behalf of @entity2 , or some of @entity8 's troops in the isolated country 's own ' cyber army '			1
base of operations ? according to @entity343 , a defector has stated that @entity2 keeps a hacker cell here , at this hotel in @entity347 , @entity348			0
