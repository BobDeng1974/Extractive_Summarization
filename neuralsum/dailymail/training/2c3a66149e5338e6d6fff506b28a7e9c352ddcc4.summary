it is known as the ' @entity1 ' due to a crater making it look like the @entity4 weapon			1
however , astronomers say they are a step closer to solving a mystery that has baffled them for decades about @entity10 's @entity9			0
the moon has an odd wobble - and scientists say its core is is either wonky or awash with water			1
researchers used numerous images of @entity19 taken by @entity29 's @entity28 mission to determine how much the moon wobbles as it orbits @entity10			1
@entity28 was sent to @entity10 in 1997 to explore the planet and its many moons , which so far number 62 ( 53 with names )			0
the researchers built a detailed 3d model of @entity19 using images taken from various angles , and tracked the movement of hundreds of reference points on its pockmarked surface			1
it has a tell - tale wobble that is twice as big as expected for a moon with a regular , solid structure			1
@entity19 is mostly made of ice and has a diameter of 396km			0
the researchers offer two explanations for the wobble : either it has a vast ocean beneath its surface , or a rocky core with a weird shape resembling a rugby ball			1
the study appears in @entity54			0
its authors are astronomers in the @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , who based their calculations on high - resolution photos of @entity19 snapped by @entity63 spacecraft			0

' after carefully examining @entity19 , we found it librates - that is , it subtly wobbles - around the moon 's polar axis , ' said lead author dr @entity82 , who works at @entity83 in the @entity57			1
apart from these gentle ' librations ' , @entity19 otherwise presents the same face to @entity10 throughout its orbit			0
' the data suggest that something is not right , so to speak , inside @entity19 , ' said @entity82			0
' the amount of wobble we measured is double what was predicted			0
' either possiblity for the interior of @entity19 would be interesting , according to @entity82 , as the moon 's heavily cratered outward appearance does not suggest anything unusual lies beneath its surface			2
@entity28 was sent to @entity10 in 1997 to explore the planet and its many moons , which so far number 62 ( 53 with names )			0
because @entity19 formed more than four billion years ago , scientists would expect its core to have relaxed into a more or less spherical shape by now			2
so if @entity19 ' core is oblong in shape , it likely represents a record of the moon 's formation , frozen in time			1
if @entity19 possesses an ocean , it would join an exclusive club of ' ocean worlds ' that includes several moons of @entity115 and two other @entity10 moons , @entity117 and @entity118			2
a global ocean would be surprising , said @entity82 , as the surface of @entity19 does not display signs of geologic activity			2
like a lot of moons in the solar system , including our own , @entity19 always shows essentially the same face to its parent planet			0
this is called a spin - orbit resonance , meaning the moon 's rotation , or spin , is in sync with its orbit around @entity10			2
like @entity136 's moon , @entity19 takes the same amount of time to spin completely around on its axis as it takes to orbit its planet			2
' observing libration can provide useful insights about what is going on inside a body , ' said @entity82			0
' in this case , it is telling us that this cratered little moon may be more complex than we thought			2
' models developed by @entity82 and co-authors from @entity58 and @entity59 indicate that , if @entity19 is hiding a liquid water ocean , it lies 15 to 20 miles ( 24 to 31 kilometers ) beneath the moon 's impact - battered surface			1
at 246 miles ( 396 kilometers ) wide , @entity19 is too small to have retained internal heat from its formation , so some other source of energy would be required to maintain an underground ocean			0
the researchers note that there is evidence that @entity19 ' current , elongated orbit could have been even more stretched out in the past , which might have created enough tidal heating to produce an ocean .			1

@entity168 has a large crater making it look like the @entity4 weapon
researchers found moon wobbled far more than they expected
experts believe it caused by an ocean or a rugby shaped core
