@entity1 hero @entity0 has called for a change to the ' ridiculous ' rule that will see him banned from a second final in successive seasons			1
@entity0 picked up his second booking of the competition in sunday 's @entity10 semi-final win over @entity11 – meaning automatic suspension for the season finale on may 30			1
but the central defender , who also missed last year 's @entity15 for the same reason , says either the threshold should be raised – or all cards should be wiped from the record for any show - piece final			1
@entity1 defender @entity0 will miss the @entity10 final after picking up his second yellow card @entity0 was shown a yellow card for this challenge on @entity11 's @entity25 ( right ) during the semi-final ' having two bookings ( as the limit ) in a cup competition is ridiculous , ' said @entity0			1
' especially being a defender , it means you ca n't tackle - and that 's part and parcel of being a defender , making challenges , making interceptions , making blocks			1
' to have something like that taken away from you is a little bit gutting			0
i think it should be looked at			0
they should either increase the number of bookings needed to get a suspension - or , if you get to the final , wipe it out completely			2
' then it 's fair for everyone , every team that gets to the semi-final , whoever is booked knows it 's a clean slate for the final			2
' @entity0 knew instantly that he 'd miss the final when ref @entity58 rightly showed him a yellow card for hauling back @entity25			1
more annoying for the 30 - year - old is that his previous booking in the competition came for dissent , as he explaining : ' that was my own fault gobbing off to a referee			2
that 's disappointing because i should have kept my mouth shut			2
it was against @entity69 , that 's me getting frustrated and being too gobby to the referee			2
' that hurts the most because this one was a tackle and a foul but the first one was a very silly booking			0
i 'm 30 years old and i should know better			2
' when you come into this game you always think about it and wonder what if - but if you start allowing it to play on your mind then you 're going to pull out of tackles			0
i wo n't do that			0
@entity0 feels that the rule to have players suspended for amassing just two yellows is ' ridiculous ' @entity11 's @entity88 ( right ) slides in with a challenge on @entity90 ( left ) during the @entity10 semi-final ' after missing last year 's final , i 'm gutted again			1
it 's just lady luck			0
you take it on the chin and move on			0
' @entity0 says he will definitely not be doing a @entity97 and turning up in full kit to take part in any celebrations should @entity101 beat @entity102 in the final , saying : ' no , that 's not me at all , no chance			1
i 'll be in the background somewhere , in the stands			0
' i suppose you kind of feel not part of it in the final but i 'll still have a few beers			0
for the size of @entity1 , as a small club , to get to a final for a second successive year is an unbelievable achievement			1
' everything is in our hands			0
we 've got to bring back silverware for the way we ' ve worked in the last three seasons			0
' @entity1 ' @entity124 scores his side 's second goal during the 3 - 2 win over @entity11 on sunday @entity1 players celebrate @entity129 's ( second from right ) winning goal against @entity11 on sunday			1

@entity1 ' @entity0 will miss the club 's first - ever @entity10 final
@entity0 picked up his second yellow card of the @entity1 in the semi-final against @entity11 and is therefore suspended for the *showdown* on may 30
he was also suspended for the @entity141 final last season
the defender believes the threshold for yellow card suspensions should be raised and is disappointed to be missing out on making *history*
