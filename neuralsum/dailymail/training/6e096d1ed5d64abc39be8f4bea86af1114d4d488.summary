by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:05 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 14:54 est , 19 november 2012 ' bonkers ' : mayor @entity3 , pictured today before a speech to business leaders , told his team the @entity7 would be ' bonkers ' not to hire @entity9 @entity11 ’s new election guru has again been cast into the spotlight after it was claimed he branded @entity3 ’s closest aides ‘ * * * * wits ’ as he guided him to a second mayoral victory			1
an explosive new book about @entity3 ’s campaign alleges @entity9 - brought in by the prime minister to rejuvenate the @entity20 's election prospects - launched the foul - mouthed and withering rant during his time at @entity23			1
the latest damaging allegations come as @entity25 today demanded the prime minister investigate claims recently appointed mr @entity9 launched an expletive - laden verbal assault about @entity29			1
the timing of claims by mr @entity3 's former political director , @entity32 , in his book @entity34 in @entity35 , are likely to prove uncomfortable for @entity20 hierarchy			1
yesterday it emerged he once claims the mayor should concentrate on winning support from traditional @entity41 , not ‘ * * * * ing @entity29 ’			2
@entity25 frontbencher @entity42 today wrote to the pm calling for mr @entity9 to make a public statement about the claims			1
yesterday mr @entity9 , whose tactics helped to win four elections for former @entity47 prime minister @entity46 , said he had absolutely no recollection of using the phrase and that any suggestion he was racist was ‘ mischievous ’			2
but in his letter to mr @entity11 , mr @entity42 says : ' mr @entity9 has been given the opportunity to deny using these words , and has refused to do so			2
' the @entity25 vice-chairman calls on mr @entity11 to ' fully investigate the claims that mr @entity9 used such appalling language against @entity29 '			1
if true he should ' refuse to give someone with such views a role in your party '			0
‘ i hope you agree that there can be no place for racist attitudes or language such as this in any modern political party , ' mr @entity42 adds			0
@entity9 , known as the ‘ @entity67 ’ for masterminding multiple election victories in his native @entity47 , has been hired to focus on winning back core conservative voters over the next two - and - a - half years			1
the appointment is intended to rejuvenate the party after its crushing defeat in the @entity73 by - election on friday , and record low turnout in the police and crime commissioner elections			0
but some in the party fear mr @entity9 , who has a reputation as a right - wing attack dog , will alienate floating voters by taking a hard line on divisive issues such as crime and immigration , which backfired when he ran the 2005 election campaign of then @entity20 leader @entity88			1
victory : @entity35 mayor @entity3 with his then campaign manager @entity9 on the @entity91 results night in 2012 former deputy party chairman @entity92 warned he was a ‘ distracting influence ’ and a recipe for ‘ conflict and confusion ’ while mr @entity11 ’s former speechwriter @entity98 said hiring him was a ‘ regressive step ’			1
but mr @entity3 , whose two successful @entity35 mayoral campaigns were run by mr @entity9 , has been urging the prime minister to snap him up , saying he is ‘ the best campaign manager i ’ve ever seen ’			1
election : mr @entity9 will start work for pm @entity11 early next year			1
critics worry about his reputation as a ' right wing attack dog ' a @entity109 source said @entity110 – mr @entity11 ’s election strategist in 2010 – had been pushing for his appointment for months			2
the source said : ‘ @entity110 has always argued for this			0
it was @entity110 who got @entity9 into the @entity3 campaign in the first place and we need a dedicated campaign manager			1
’ mr @entity9 will start work as campaign manager early next year , initially part time , and it is understood he will focus on day - to - day planning , while the prime minister and the chancellor will remain in control of policy and strategy			2
he is said to be on a salary of £ 200,000			0
polls over the weekend gave @entity25 a 12 - point lead , following the @entity41 ’ loss of @entity73 – a key middle @entity132 seat vacated by @entity134 – to @entity25 ’s @entity135 on a swing of nearly 13 per cent , and concerns expressed by backbenchers about a lack of focus in @entity141			0
@entity142 , editor of influential website @entity143 , said mr @entity9 had ‘ a good record of success and is perhaps the alpha male that @entity148 has been missing since @entity150 exited ’			0
@entity20 chairman @entity151 praised him as a ‘ serious campaigner ’			0
he added : ‘ @entity9 brings the kind of focus that ’s required to manage campaigns and we have a big job to do to explain what ’s going on			0
’ after the collapse of plans for boundary changes , the conservatives will target 40 seats , half of which are held by their @entity167 coalition partners , in 2015			0
mr @entity151 said : ‘ i do n’t really mind who the opposition is			0
we need to win those seats if we are going to form the next government and have an outright majority and do some of the things this country desperately needs			0
’ @entity3 said he did not recognise ‘ any suggestion of abusive or offensive language ’ from his staff and that the conservative party had ‘ done well to retain [ mr @entity9 ’s ] services ’ .			2

@entity11 faces call to investigate claims his new election guru @entity9 ranted about @entity29 when advising @entity3
@entity47 @entity9 was *dubbed* the @entity67 for a string of election successes , *including* @entity3 's
@entity11 has hired him to run 2015 *general* election campaign
but @entity25 is demanding an investigation into claims @entity9 made foul - mouthed comments about @entity29 voters during @entity23 bid
