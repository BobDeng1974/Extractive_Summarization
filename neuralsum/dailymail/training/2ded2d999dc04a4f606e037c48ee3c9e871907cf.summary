@entity0 today insisted his job is not ' bombproof ' as he dismissed suggestions @entity4 ' desperate financial position is the only thing preventing him from being sacked			1
but he did admit he will accept any road back to @entity9 's top flight - even if it means using the play - offs to finally reclaim the @entity15 side 's @entity13 place			1
@entity0 has come under a wave of flak from supporters since monday 's dismal 3 - 1 defeat to @entity20			1
@entity0 claims that no manager is completely safe from losing his job sections of the @entity15 faithful jeered their team after the shock 3 - 1 home defeat to @entity20 his team have already lost at home to @entity29 this season and now trail their @entity32 rivals by six points			1
but the @entity35 boss hit back at claims the hefty settlement package he would be due as part of his £ 400,000 - a - year contract had made the @entity15 board think twice about handing him his @entity41			1
rangers were forced to launch an emergency share issue last month in order to pay september 's wages and will have to do the same again before the year is out			2
' i do n't think anyone is bombproof , ' said @entity0			1
' i would n't sit here for a minute and say i 'm bombproof			0
i 'm still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof			0
' @entity51 ( @entity52 ) and @entity53 walk off dejected after being beaten 3 - 1 by @entity20 at home asked if he would consider quitting if he lost the support of the @entity57 faithful , @entity0 replied : ' that 's a hypothetical question which i would n't answer			1
' neither did the club 's all - time record goalscorer let himself be riled by the barrage of complaints which have poured in his direction since losing to @entity67 ' men			2
former @entity9 midfielder @entity68 even claimed in a national newspaper column this week that @entity0 was failing as a manager by not training his players properly			1
but the @entity15 boss said : ' i will tell you the truth , i genuinely do n't care about the criticism and i 'll tell you why			1
if @entity77 can get stick here winning nine ( @entity81 titles ) in a row and getting to the @entity84 final , then it 's fair to say i will receive a certain degree of criticism			0
' i respect everyone 's opinion but i do n't necessarily agree with it			0
i 'm always under pressure			0
i have never felt under more pressure or any less pressure			0
i just want to get the job done			0
' @entity20 star @entity94 celebrates his second goal in front of the @entity4 fans monday 's display may have been woeful but @entity4 still sit second in the promotion battle			1
with three further matches against @entity105 's unbeaten @entity104 troops to come , the @entity101 champions could yet fight their way back into contention			0
but @entity0 claims he would take promotion by the play - off back door if his side fail to reign in their title rivals			1
' relying on the play - offs is not out of the question because getting out of the division is the most important thing , ' he said ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity117			0
' we will take whatever we can to get out of this division because it is so important for the club to get back into the top flight as soon as possible			0
' @entity4 will head along the @entity124 to the @entity125 without defender @entity126 after he was given a three - game ban for lashing out at @entity20 defender @entity128 in the seconds after @entity53 had struck the hosts ' consolation effort			1
@entity4 will be without @entity126 ( r ) at the weekend after he was banned for lashing out at @entity128 it was the @entity133 's second moment of madness in little more than three months after he headbutted @entity136 's @entity135 during a pre-season friendly			2
but @entity0 insists monday 's incident came after his player was provoked			1
' he should not have reacted when the @entity20 player punched the ball out of his hands and grabbed him round the waist , ' said the boss , who admits he is also ' hopeful ' that @entity145 will win his appeal after he was charged with headbutting @entity147			2
' but i do n't think there is any doubt he was provoked			0
' he has let himself down a couple of times recently , particularly at @entity136 , but i have got more sympathy for him from monday 's incident than i did at @entity136			0
' meanwhile , @entity0 believes @entity4 should take any investment made available to them - including from @entity156			1
the @entity158 owner splashed out £ 850,000 on tuesday as he doubled his @entity15 stake to 8.92 per cent by buying four million existing shares from investment group @entity161			2
@entity0 would give the thumbs up to any investment , including that from @entity158 owner @entity156 but the @entity167 tycoon 's purchase came just weeks after he snubbed the opportunity to invest directly in the club when it put 15million fresh stocks up for sale			2
@entity0 , however , said : ' it 's fair to say we could do with investment			2
it 's not my job to get that investment but with my manager 's hat on i would gladly hope we can get investment from whatever quarter			0
' i do n't know the ins or outs of the shares being bought this week but all i would say is that we definitely , definitely will need investment			0
