royal rift : @entity1 and @entity2 look glum at the @entity4 service in 2012 the clinking of cutlery and popping of corks could be heard from the other end of the corridor			1
behind the partly closed gilt doors of the grand dining room at @entity12 , the @entity13 was holding court with his wife , the @entity15			0
the celebration to mark his 66th birthday was in full swing , with the couple ’s closest friends charging their crystal glasses to toast the @entity13			1
at the other end of the @entity12 , prince @entity1 was in his private residence sharing a low - key supper with a friend or two of his own			1
sources close to the @entity29 ’s circle say he had not been invited to the party and did not want to spend the evening alone			2
the fact that his elder brother had not extended him an invitation was no surprise to the @entity29 , his close friends or his courtiers			0
for the truth is that relations between @entity2 and @entity1 have been strained for some time			1
and as he battles through the most challenging period of his life , prince @entity1 can not count on @entity2 ’s support			1
accused of having sex with a minor – an allegation he categorically denies – the @entity29 ’s reputation is mired in controversy , and a potentially embarrassing and unprecedented court case looms over the @entity48 like a dark cloud			1
but while @entity1 has been cushioned by courtiers and protected by certain relations and trusted friends , the one family member perhaps best versed to help guide him through these uncharted waters appears to have turned his back			0
numerous sources close to the @entity29 have told @entity57 that he has been ‘ cut off ’ by @entity2 who has ‘ left @entity1 out in the cold ’ during his darkest hours			1
the ‘ shutters came down ’ according to one source close to a senior member of the @entity48 when prince @entity1 was named in @entity63 court papers by @entity64 , who claims she was made to have had sex with him when she was a 17 - year - old ‘ sex slave ’			1
she had been working for the @entity13 ’s friend and disgraced financier @entity68 – who had already been jailed for sex offences			0
@entity2 , no stranger to controversy when it comes to his private life , would certainly be well - placed to counsel @entity1 and offer some sage advice , but it is said that the @entity13 has so far refused to discuss the scandal with his brother			1
while they have historically had fall - outs , @entity1 ’s friends believe this to be the most serious yet			2
relations between them are apparently so strained that they barely speak			0
a friend of a prominent family member says that @entity2 – a great memo and letter writer to his family , particularly when it comes to matters of importance – has not written to @entity1 for months			2
‘ the froideur is worse than ever , ’ the friend said			0
‘ @entity2 considers the whole sex scandal degrading , damaging and very embarrassing			2
‘ he thinks that his brother has made some very bad decisions but he has said nothing to @entity1 , he simply has n’t communicated with him at all			2
there ’s been a very icy silence			0
’ @entity2 ’s patience with @entity1 apparently snapped when he was photographed in @entity98 with @entity68 in 2011 after the tycoon had served an 18 - month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution			1
the ‘ shutters came down ’ according to one source when prince @entity1 was named in @entity63 court papers by @entity64 ( pictured with the @entity29 ) the damage to @entity1 ’s reputation began to show when he stepped down as the @entity109 ’s @entity108 that year , but more damning allegations came in january this year when ms @entity64 , now 31 , went to court			1
while the @entity2 ’s spokesman denies there has been a fall out , insisting rumours of a rift are ‘ categorically untrue ’ , sources close to prince @entity1 say he feels that he has been deliberately frozen out by his brother			1
@entity2 is evidently easily rattled when it comes to his problematic sibling – according to another well - placed source who is an acquaintance of @entity2 , the @entity13 will not have @entity1 ’s name mentioned in his presence			1
‘ i was told never to mention @entity1 ’s name in the @entity2 ’s company , ’ the source revealed			1
the tension between the brothers is a sensitive subject for the @entity48			0
‘ this is no brotherly spat , ’ said a friend of one senior @entity130			0
‘ it is a seismic shift downhill in @entity2 ’s relationship with his errant brother which seems terminal			1
‘ @entity1 is having to live with the harsh reality that @entity2 has cut him off and left him out in the cold			1
’ @entity1 has been relying heavily on the support of his immediate family			2
his ex-wife @entity140 was the first to rush to his defence , saying on @entity63 television that @entity1 is a ‘ humongously good man ’			2
but while there have been unprecedented public denials from the @entity12 , and a calculated show of unity from the @entity148 , @entity149 and his wife @entity150 , who all recently attended an engagement with @entity1 , there has , tellingly , been no show of public support from @entity2 , who has refused to be drawn into the scandal			1
‘ he does not want to become involved in any way			0
he is very angry that his brother has put the family in this very difficult and embarrassing situation , ’ added the friend			0
but his ex-wife @entity140 was the first to rush to his defence , saying on television that @entity1 is a ‘ humongously good man ’ ‘ @entity2 has very serious concerns about @entity1			1
he can see legal fees going through the roof , there ’s a serious risk of @entity1 becoming involved in a court case , and unanswered questions about his friendship with @entity68 and this girl			2
‘ then there ’s the fact that @entity1 is still living with his ex-wife and has just bought a very expensive ski chalet with her			2
@entity2 thinks @entity1 is making a fool of himself where @entity140 is concerned			2
’ with @entity1 ’s aides swinging into damage limitation mode in conjunction with the heavyweights at royal lawyers @entity180 and @entity181 , a firefighting pr strategy is in motion			2
last month @entity12 issued a statement saying : ‘ it is emphatically denied that the @entity29 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity64			0
the allegations are false and without any foundation			0
’ and last month in @entity57 , @entity1 ’s ex-girlfriend @entity190 broke her 32 - year silence about their friendship in order to defend him , saying : ‘ i firmly believe i can help rebut , with authority , the allegations against him			1
’ the @entity148 too has shown her loyalty in her own unique and subtle way			0
she bestowed the honorary title of vice admiral of the @entity203 on her son on his 55th birthday last month , sending a clear and unequivocal message to the country that she was standing by her son both in private and in public			0
but the source from @entity2 ’s circle said : ‘ @entity2 knows the @entity148 will always be a staunch defender of her second son almost to the point of lacking objectivity and reason … which has irritated him beyond measure over the years			1
’ when @entity1 celebrated his 55th birthday quietly and deliberately out of the limelight with friends , @entity2 was not invited to the private dinner			1
a close confidant of @entity1 said : ‘ he celebrated with some friends at a restaurant in @entity224 , but @entity2 was n’t there			1
’ the brothers did spend @entity226 together at @entity227 where , by all accounts , they appeared cordial			0
@entity2 and @entity1 do have a history of fall - outs			1
@entity1 was said to be ‘ spitting feathers ’ when , in 2011 , the decision was made to strip his daughters @entity232 and @entity234 of their personal protection officers			1
last month in the @entity57 , @entity1 ’s ex-girlfriend @entity190 , left , broke her 32 - year silence about their friendship in order to defend him the cost - cutting measure – endorsed by @entity2 , who is known to want a more streamlined @entity48 – was tacitly agreed to by the @entity148 and led to a dispute between the brothers			1
@entity1 argued that his daughters still needed protection but his pleas fell on deaf ears			0
‘ @entity1 was fuming , spitting feathers , ’ said a source			2
‘ he fought and fought but he lost to @entity2			0
‘ @entity2 is forging a path as the elder statesman and the force of the family and it ’s his way or no way at all			2
in many ways it ’s a rather tudor court			0
the shutters came down on @entity1 and that was it			0
’ there was further acrimony when neither @entity1 , @entity149 nor the princess royal were invited to join the @entity148 during the closing celebrations for the @entity265 in 2012			2
with the @entity29 in hospital suffering from a bladder infection , the @entity148 was left to carry out a @entity12 balcony appearance accompanied only by @entity2 ’s family of @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 , and @entity273			1
it was , according to one family friend , @entity2 ’s decision that only the most senior members of the family should accompany the @entity148 to wave to the masses who had gathered in @entity281			1
the episode is said to have driven a greater wedge between @entity2 and @entity1 , who resented his brother for the public snub			0
moreover , it appeared to suggest that @entity1 ’s place within the scheme of things was becoming more tenuous			0
a source close to the family said : ‘ @entity149 took it on the chin , there was no whining sniping or pleading , but @entity1 was livid			0
‘ interestingly @entity1 has become much closer to @entity149 and relies on him more these days			0
‘ it ’s no accident that @entity1 was allowed to put a picture of the @entity298 and the @entity148 on his @entity300 page the other week			0
‘ it was published with the @entity148 ’s permission and blessing and gave a much needed emphasis of the warm and close brotherly relationship between @entity149 and @entity1			0
’ a spokesman for @entity1 declined to comment on private family matters , but a senior royal aide dismissed the idea of a rift as untrue			1
however , neither would comment on the specific detail of how @entity2 and @entity1 have behaved towards each other in recent months , saying it is a private family matter			0
a @entity316 spokesman said : ' family relationships are a private matter but this story , as relayed , is categorically untrue			2
' clearly , however , there is a coolness that is causing tension in the family – and it is being openly discussed			0
while the @entity148 , understandably , is reluctant to get involved it looks as though she may be required to act as peacekeeper once again			0
