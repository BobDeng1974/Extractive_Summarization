by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 08:00 est , 4 april 2013 a pill which promises a good night ’s sleep without side - effects could be on its way			0
the drug , which has already been successfully tested on animals , could allow people to sleep soundly at night and wake up without the groggy feeling that blights many other tablets			0
billed as ‘ a good night ’s sleep without the side - effects ’ , the tablet , which is known only as @entity11 , works in a different way to the existing pills taken by millions of @entity16			1
soundly sleeping : billed as ¿ a good night ¿ s sleep without the side - effects ¿ , the tablet , which is known only as @entity11 , works in a different way to the existing pills taken by millions of @entity16 ( file picture ) it and similar drugs could ‘ usher in a new era for insomnia treatment ’ the journal @entity25 reports			1
some 15million prescriptions for sleeping pills are written out each year and although newer drugs produce fewer side - effects patients can still experience problems with concentration and grogginess			1
concerns that @entity16 has become a nation of sleeping pill addicts has led to doctors being urged to first try alternative treatments such as counselling			2
most of the £ 50million a year spent by the @entity42 on sleeping pills , or hypnotics , as they are known to doctors , goes on drugs that target a calming brain chemical called @entity48			1
insomnia : some 15million prescriptions for sleeping pills are written out each year ( file picture ) in contrast , @entity52 works on orexin , a brain compound that helps keep us awake			1
in tests , rats given the drug slept longer than those given a dummy pill			0
and after being given the drug , the creatures remained free of the memory problems that affected rats given valium or one of two more modern sleeping pills			1
similarly , monkeys given the other pills suffered problems with memory and alertness			2
however , @entity72 was free of those problems and did not impact on reaction times , even when given at extremely high doses			1
the pharmaceutical giant , @entity76 , which is developing the drug , said that the tests mimicked a situation in which someone would wake up shortly after taking a sleeping pill			2
it added that more work is needed to check that the pill does n’t cause grogginess the next morning			0
@entity52 is only being used in lab tests at the moment			0
however , another drug in the same family has been tested on people and is very close to the market			0
an accompanying article , also in the journal @entity25 , says that such tablets could usher in a new era for insomnia treatment			1
however , the commentary ’s author , a sleep researcher from @entity99 in the @entity100 , also urges caution , saying that the search for the perfect sleeping pill has been ‘ marked by cycles of exuberance followed by disappointment , as adverse side - effects have emerged following widespread use ’			2
he adds that only time will tell if @entity110 - 22 , and similar drugs , are ‘ the perfect hypnotics ’			0
professor @entity113 , founder of the sleep centre at @entity115 , warned that tampering with orexin might produce other side - effects such as an increase in appetite			0
he added that the real challenge will be to find a pill that gets to the root cause of insomnia , rather than merely being a quick fix			2
