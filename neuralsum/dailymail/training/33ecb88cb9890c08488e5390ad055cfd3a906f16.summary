by @entity0 @entity2 scientists are working on next - generation combat wear for @entity2 soldiers inspired by the nano suit worn in the @entity7 films @entity2 scientists are working on next - generation combat wear for soldiers inspired by the nano suit worn in the @entity7 films and it could be used two or three years away			1
the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) would effectively give its wearer superpowers , such as the ability to see in the dark , super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets , but its is a work in progress			1
the @entity2 @entity20 ( @entity20 ) has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films that uses nanotechnology			1
such a suit would probably build upon work done by an @entity26 professor who is developing ' liquid armour ' , which captured the imagination of @entity2 armed forces scientists who are looking for a way of protecting their troops from intensive combat situations in @entity33 and @entity34			1
at a conference in may , @entity36 admiral @entity35 challenged scientists to build a suit that would function as a ' practical exoskeleton ' and protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets using @entity43 and nanotechnology			1
he said that the suit should be light enough for soldiers to wear in battle but also suitable for surveillance missions and the idea has captured people 's imaginations - as seen in the animated video below			0
professor @entity53 has been working on his ' liquid armour ' technology for 11 years , which is focused on the flow of unusual materials , according to the @entity57			1
his team 's research is based on his understanding of how liquids can be elastic or solid in certain situations			0
once fully developed , the armour could transform from a more liquid form to a solid in a fraction of a second under the influence of a magnetic field or electric current as well as being able to monitor a soldier 's heart rate , hydration levels and core temperature , @entity63 reported			2
it is thought a suit would respond to the data , supplied by an on - board computer hooked up to sensors , to keep a soldier in the best conditions for battle			0
professor @entity53 told @entity84 that the suit sounds like @entity7			2
' the other kind of things that you see in the movies i think that would be more realistic at the moment would be the kind of external suit that @entity94 wears in @entity95 , where it ’s a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human , ' he said			0
the request for super body armour for troops was announced following the death of a soldier in @entity34			0
he was reportedly trying to rescue a civilian but was shot from the other side of a door - but he might have survived if he had have been better protected by his clothing			0
a @entity109 ( @entity12 ) would effectively give its wearer superpowers , such as the ability to see in the dark , super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets , but its is a work in progress			1
currently soldiers have relatively little protection and take cover in the face of fire and explosions ( pictured ) @entity20 has asked academics , entrepreneurs and private laboratories to submit white papers detailing how its @entity12 suit could be built and how they could help make their designs a reality , while other reports suggest that @entity132 could be utilised to provide soldiers with information on the battle field			1
@entity136 to give people super humans strength and night vision already exist , but the challenge is building the technology into a lightweight suit			2
professor @entity53 said the name of the suit - @entity12 - has been chosen deliberately as it is the names of the bronze armoured giant from @entity147			2
he said : ' like all good superheros , @entity12 has one weakness			0
for the @entity151 ’s @entity12 , the weak spot is either the need to carry around a heavy pump for an hydraulic system , or lots of heavy batteries			0
we do n’t have @entity7 ’s power source yet ! '			0

the @entity2 @entity20 ( @entity20 ) has called on scientists to develop a suit using nanotechnology reminiscent of the one seen in the films
the @entity11 could combine a *bulletproof* material with an exoskeleton to give the wearer super-human strength
such a suit would probably build upon work done by an @entity26 professor who is developing ' liquid armour '
