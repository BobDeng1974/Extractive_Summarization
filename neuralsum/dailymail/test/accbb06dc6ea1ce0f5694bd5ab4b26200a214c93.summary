a 12 - year - old boy has succeeded where many in the media have tried and failed by fearlessly cutting president @entity3 off mid-ramble during a q&a session on thursday			1
@entity6 from @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , was moderating a town hall event when the president started getting a little long - winded when answering a question about how to avoid writer 's block			1

i think you 've sort of covered everything about that question , ' he said as the audience laughed			1

@entity3 was at the @entity29 in @entity30 for a ' virtual field trip ' with students to promote @entity34 initiatives to make free e-books available to low - income students and to get cities to provide access to universal library cards			2
@entity6 also managed to skillfully tease details about @entity3 's early reading habits , his post-presidency plans and his facility with digital media			1
middle schoolers at a @entity30 library and students watching online may have puzzled over @entity3 's reference to the @entity49 , just like @entity3 appeared stumped by @entity6 's mention of @entity51			1

' what that means is , is that we want to make sure that that becomes a tool not just for entertainment , not just for talking to your friends , but also for learning			0
' asked what inspired him to be president , @entity3 conceded he had once harbored wishes to be an architect or basketball player but was ultimately inspired by the civil rights movement			2

' i 'll still be pretty young , ' he said			0
' and so i 'll go back to doing the kinds of work that i was doing before , just trying to find ways to help people — help young people get educations , and help people get jobs , and try to bring businesses into neighborhoods that do n't have enough businesses			0
