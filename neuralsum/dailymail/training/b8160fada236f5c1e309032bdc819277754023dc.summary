by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 lit up the @entity3 on monday evening , giving an eye - catching all - round performance for @entity6 that merited his two goals in the 3 - 1 win over @entity9 and easily deserved his man of the match award			1
but if you think the 24 - year - old @entity14 striker is now destined to be a leading scorer as @entity6 romp to the @entity17 title , his career to date suggests you better think again			1
any strike force is only as strong as its weakest link , and there is no doubt @entity2 remains @entity6 ’s weakest link among the first - team squad ’s four strikers : @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 being the others			2
’ he pounced in predatory fashion upon @entity42 ’s 41st - minute error to open the scoring last night			0
then at the end of a superb second - half move involving 19 passes and an exquisite final exchange with @entity48 , he drilled home for 2 - 0			0
but one delicious double , or even a few , spaced out , does not a superstar make			0
@entity2 scored a @entity53 brace against @entity9 for @entity54 in 2009 and is arguably still yet to have a sustained run of top - level consistency , five years later			1
so while @entity6 ’s manager @entity29 was right to describe @entity2 , signed in summer 2013 for £ 22m , as a ‘ very important player ’ , and to stress ‘ we never had any doubt about his quality ’ , he was also right to qualify his statements , saying : ‘ if he ’s fit all the year , he will be a very important player for us			1
’ in two of the past four seasons @entity2 has spent much or all of the season injured			2
he missed the whole of the 2010 - 11 campaign for @entity54 with an injury to the cruciate ligament in his right knee			0
in his debut year with @entity6 last season , he made just three league starts ( among 13 appearances ) as he was variously sidelined with knocks , illness , calf and shin problems and two separate hamstring lay - offs			2
strike one : @entity85 hammers in @entity6 's opening goal against @entity9 on monday night doubling up : the @entity14 forward ( left ) makes it two with a good finish in the second half @entity2 's stunner : how @entity2 scored his superb second goal against @entity9 as a prodigious youngster , @entity2 first played league football for @entity95 aged 16 in 2006 and scored his first hat - trick at 17			1
but starting young means @entity2 ’s career already has longevity ; this is his 10th season as professional footballer and he has never scored more than 14 league goals in any season			1
he ’s scored league goals in double figures in just three seasons , one of those as a teenager with @entity95			1
the 14 - goal season was with @entity54 in 2011 - 12 in a campaign where @entity2 was the leading striker , and main man , but it was a disrupted year of multiple managerial changes and ended with a 15th - place finish in @entity111 monday night ’s goals were significant , and in a major game			1
as @entity29 said : ‘ @entity9 are an important team and one that will be fighting for the title			0
’ but @entity2 ’s three @entity17 goals last season , his only three before monday , were less cases of shooting down major rivals as shooting fish in barrels			1
put your shirt on him : @entity2 celebrates a rare @entity17 goal last season , against @entity125 bench boy : @entity2 ( right ) was familiar in his role as a substitute last season his first goal came in a 5 - 1 win at 10 - man @entity131 , and was the fourth goal of the five			2
his second goal was in a 4 - 1 win against @entity136 , the fourth goal			0
his third goal was in a 4 - 0 win against @entity125 , the third goal			0
all were scored with @entity2 in the substitute role , and of course it is not his fault that he was not on the pitch earlier in those games			2
having said that , in the pecking order of scorers , @entity2 is very much @entity6 ’s fourth striker in hard numbers			1
in all competitions last season , @entity25 scored 28 goals in 34 games at a rate of 0.82 per game to make him @entity6 ’s hottest striker			1
by the same goals - per - game reckoning ( see table below ) , @entity26 and @entity27 were both ahead of @entity2 , as was midfielder @entity160			2
taking only league games into consideration , and using the goals - per - game method so as not to penalise players used infrequently , @entity2 was not only behind @entity25 , @entity160 , @entity26 and @entity27 but also @entity165			2
down the list : @entity2 was the bottom of @entity6 's strikers in terms of goals per game last season international class : the forward captaining @entity14 against @entity173 in a @entity175 qualifier last year announcing himself : a young @entity2 slots the ball past @entity9 's @entity178 in 2009 and ( below ) celebrates and if you think it is unfair to compare @entity2 to others over one injury - hit season , how does he fare when you compare him over several years against @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 ? the answer , in pure goal terms , is he comes fourth of four , whether in terms of goals per game or minutes per goal , in the three full seasons ( plus this season ) since @entity2 ’s full missed season in 2010 - 11			1
( see table below )			0
so his relative lack of goals can not be put down to the fact that he only gets on the pitch for short times			0
@entity25 ’s record of one league goal every 113 minutes for three years is stunning ; @entity2 ’s tally of one every 168 minutes , including last nights two in 80 , is fine but not sensational			0
having said all that , @entity2 is not a main striker , he is a support striker , as much creator and provider as converter of chances			0
his problem will be how often he gets into the team when the others are all fit , because while he ’s a decent player , he ’s not a title - sealer , yet			0
propping them up : @entity2 does not come out well when record over the last three seasons are compared			0

@entity2 will never score enough goals to fire @entity6 to the title
striker scored just three goals for @entity6 last season
they all came against *inferior* *opposition* and not title rivals
@entity14 star moved to the @entity3 for £ 22m in 2013
@entity2 has never scored more than 14 league goals in any season
