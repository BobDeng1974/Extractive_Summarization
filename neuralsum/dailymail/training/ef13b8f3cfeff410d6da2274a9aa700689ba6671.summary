by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 15 september 2012 updated : 07:58 est , 16 september 2012 vow : @entity1 recovering at hospital the 59 - year - old @entity3 who cheated death after being gored , thrown into the air and then trampled on by a 900kg bull has vowed never to enter the ring again			1
terrifying footage emerged earlier this week showing football referee @entity1 being launched from a three metre high ' pyramid ' ramp and then attacked twice on the ground by the beast			1
today , speaking from his hospital bed , he has revealed how moving his head by just a fraction as the bull bore down on him for a second time ' almost certainly ' saved his life			1
waiting to be operated on for a fractured shoulder , broken right wrist , two splintered ribs and bruises on his legs , he thanked the the brave onlookers who came to his rescue			1
he said that without the help of those at the @entity28 bullring , who distracted the bull so he could be carried out , he probably would not ' be here anymore '			1
he added : ' this goring will be the last because i 'm not getting in the ring any more and , if i go again to see the bulls in the future it will be to watch it from the side			0
' i was very close to death , one of the horns passed just centimetres away from my head when i was on the floor , and now i 'm suffering			2
i do n't want to put myself in that situation again			0
he was reportedly well known in his youth for spontaneously jumping over the bullring barrier at local bullfights			0
but , he said , he gave up his wild ways when his children were born in a bid to become more responsible			0
three men wait on and near a three metre high ' pyramid ' ramp just before a bull , lurking near the edge of the ring , brutally attacks one of them during a @entity59 town 's fiestas terrifying : the bull charges up the ramp towards one of the men and he tries to flee away from the beast he added : ' but when , 10 years ago , my children were older i went back to my passion			1
' of monday 's incident , the @entity82 resident said : ' it was all my fault			0
i took too many risks and was too confident because i did n't think the bull would climb the stairs so quickly			2
' i stopped and he threw me powerfully , i got caught , and in that moment i was already regretting getting into that situation			0
' i did n't lose conciousness at any moment , and i could see him flying down the stairs and i thought that was the end for me			0
but it was n't , thank @entity97			0
' the man is tossed into the air by the charging bull which has made its way onto the top of the platform the bull tramples on the 59 - year - old man who is left with ' multiple injuries ' and speaking to those who have praised his courage , he said : ' i 'm not brave , i 'm just a madman			2
' this could be especially true , seeing as he broke his left wrist in a similar situation just three years ago and has undergone four operations to heal it			2
the incident , in the south - eastern province of @entity116 , came during the town of @entity28 's fiestas - an annual seven - day celebration at the start of each september			1
each afternoon of the festivities sees four young bulls released , one at a time , into the town 's bullring for a 20 - minute run - around			1
' runners ' are encouraged to sprint past the animals and ' show their bravado ' in the event which is common - place in many towns across the country			0
the ' vaca ' , as it is dubbed by locals , regularly attracts hundreds of spectators - but unlike a bullfight does not end with the animal 's death			0
