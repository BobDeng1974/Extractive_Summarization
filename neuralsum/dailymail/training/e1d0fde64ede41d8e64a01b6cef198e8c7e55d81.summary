we could soon be able to design cells or entire organisms using computer software and 3d printers , a scientist has claimed			1
the cells could be used to create biofuels , combat global warming , develop new healthcare and medicines and even recreate alien lifeforms on earth , if alien dna is ever found			1
@entity13 - who helped map the human genome and created the world 's first synthetic life form in 2010 - details the theory in his new book life at the @entity19 : from the @entity20 to the @entity21			1
@entity13 - who created the world 's first synthetic life form in 2010 - believes we could soon be designing cells and organisms using computer software and 3d printers			1
the cells could be used to create biofuels , combat global warming , develop new medicines and even recreate alien lifeforms ' the day is not far off when we will be able to send a robotically controlled genome sequencing unit to other planets to read the dna sequence of any alien microbe life that may be there , ' claimed @entity13			1
' if we can beam them back to @entity35 we should be able to reconstruct their genomes			0
the synthetic version of a @entity40 genome could then be used to recreate @entity40 life on @entity35			2
' this could even be reversed , and if aliens pick up digital transmissions of human dna they could recreate humans on their planet			2
talking to @entity49 , @entity13 claims the synthetic cells could be designed using specifically designed software			1
@entity13 , pictured , is the president of the @entity52 , which conducts research into synthetic biology			2
he is seeking to patent the first lifeform created by humans , dubbed @entity57			0
in 2000 , @entity13 and @entity58 from the @entity59 and @entity61 @entity60 claimed they had mapped the entire human genome			1
a dna molecule - shaped similar to a spiral staircase or ladder - is made up of chemicals that link together and form the rungs of this ladder shape			0
the sides of the ladder are made of sugar and phosphate			0
human bodies have around 3 billion base pairs , but only 4 per cent of those pairs are said to influence how genes react and behave			0
the finished sequence was completed , with 99.99 per cent accuracy in 2003			0
in may 2010 , @entity13 was part of a team that became the first to successfully create ' synthetic life			2
' they did this by adding a long dna molecule containing a bacterium genome into another cell			0
the team analysed the genome of a microbe and reconstructed it from laboratory chemicals before inserting the finished @entity85 into a bacterial cell , which began to grow and reproduce			0
scientists would then be able to manipulate and modify the dna by adding certain features to create tailor - made microbes			0
these advances in genome technology will form part of a ' genetic revolution ' , according to @entity13 , and ' could give humanity crops resistant to drought and disease and artificial animals that could yield both food and drugs			1
' the cells could also be used to increase intelligence , or even extend human life			2
by designing the cells on a computer , they would become digitised , making it possible to send the sequencing around the world over the web			1
@entity13 is seeking to patent the first lifeform created by humans , dubbed @entity57 .			0

theory *suggested* by @entity119 who helped map the human genome
@entity13 claims scientists could soon design cells using computer software
this data could then be digitised , sent over the web and @entity129 printed
the synthetic cells could be modified to use as biofuels or in medicine
@entity13 claims technology could be used to recreate alien lifeforms on earth
