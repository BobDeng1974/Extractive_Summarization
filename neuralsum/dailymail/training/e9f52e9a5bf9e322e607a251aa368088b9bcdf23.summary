@entity1 scientists have been exploring the possible use of @entity3 as a biochemical weapon , newly released documents confirm			1
staff at the @entity1 's research centre at @entity8 , @entity9 , have been assessing the risk of the virus being used by terrorists such as @entity13 or @entity14 to attack the @entity15			1
the documents , released under the @entity17 , reveal that scientists have been looking into at least three potential scenarios bio weapon : @entity1 scientists have been assessing the risk of the ebola virus being used by terrorists such as @entity13 or @entity14 to attack the @entity15 the request from an unnamed source was for @entity8 staff to provide ' guidance on the feasibility and potential impact of a non-state actor exploiting the @entity3 outbreak in @entity31			1
' three potential scenarios are outlined in the document , marked ' @entity15 secret @entity15 eyes only ' , although the details are withheld			1
no information is provided regarding the first scenario , and the only detail revealed about the second scenario is that it would be both logistically and technically challenging for a non-state group to undertake '			2
following the blacked - out scenario , the team concludes : ' clearly there are practical issues involved with such a scenario that of themselves are often not insurmountable but taken together add enormously to the complexity of successfully undertaking this attack			2
' a third , also heavily redacted , scenario ' constitutes the most technically challenging of the scenarios considered here ' , @entity48 reports			1
@entity8 : the site in @entity9 has been the centre of the @entity15 's chemical weapons research for 100 years this comes after yesterday 's report that the nurse who became the first @entity59 to be diagnosed with @entity3 in the @entity15 faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from @entity31			1
@entity3 is virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human - to - human transmission			1
@entity3 spreads via direct contact with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people , and with surfaces and materials ( e.g. bedding , clothing ) contaminated with these fluids			1
the incubation period is 2 to 21 days , but the humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms			0
first symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue , muscle pain , headache and sore throat			0
this is followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			0
laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes			0
people remain infectious as long as their blood and body fluids , including semen and breast milk , contain the virus			2
the current outbreak in west @entity31 is the largest and most complex @entity3 outbreak since the ebola virus was first discovered in 1976			1
there have been more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined			0
there are currently no licensed @entity3 vaccines but two potential candidates are undergoing evaluation			1
source : @entity117 @entity118 , who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in @entity120 earlier this year while her life hung in the balance , is one of five medics having their ' fitness to practise ' assessed by regulators			0
according to one unsubstantiated report , a temperature test showed that ms @entity118 was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported			0
in theory , if any of the five are judged to have broken professional standards , they could be ' struck off '			0
last year 's outbreak of @entity3 in @entity31 has been recorded as the worst in known history with 22,894 cases and 9,177 deaths reported around the globe so far			1
a majority of confirmed cases have been found in @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , with the latter the worst affected , with 10,934 cases to date , according to the @entity117			0
the steep decline in case numbers has leveled off over the past month and the development is a cause for concern , the @entity117 said this week			0
the @entity153 has said ten times fewer people are being diagnosed with @entity3 each week than in september			2
over the past four weeks , however , the line of the graph has flattened out , with the rate around 120 to 150 new cases a week			0
health officials have expressed optimism in recent weeks that the tide seems to be turning in the fight against the deadliest @entity3 outbreak in history			2
the presidents of the three worst affected countries , @entity167 , @entity145 and @entity143 , this week said they hope to reduce the number of new cases to zero by april 15			0
@entity170 has contacted the @entity1 for comment .			2
