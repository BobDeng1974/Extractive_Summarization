by @entity0 sir @entity1 is expected to have little or no say in who will be the next manager of @entity4			1
the 72 - year - old former @entity4 boss , who won 38 trophies in 26 seasons at @entity8 , was effectively handed full authority to choose his successor after announcing his own retiremment last season			2
his choice , @entity14 , was fired today after an early mornning meeting with @entity4 chief executive at @entity4 's @entity17			0
not this time , sir @entity1 : @entity1 , who will not appoint @entity19 ' successor , checks his watch as he takes in a the match against @entity22 in this season 's @entity23 no hiding place : @entity26 ( left ) has been appointed interim manager at @entity4 following the sacking of @entity14 ( right ) the @entity4 hierarchy ’s explanation for allowing @entity1 to effectively select his successor was that it made sense to trust the judgement of someone with so much success and who was still on the payroll as a £ 2million - a - year ambassador			1
@entity4 's board clearly remain keen to maintain links with the @entity1 era , however , as they have appointed @entity26 as interim manager , with @entity42 his assistant			1
@entity44 understands that @entity45 remains part of the back - room set up despite @entity19 ' departure			1
the club are also intent on luring @entity50 back in to the @entity8 fold after the departure of @entity19 , as revealed by @entity44 earlier today			0
@entity50 has hardly been seen at the club since doing some work with under 19s manager @entity42 earlier this season after becoming disillusioned with what he felt were half - hearted attempts by @entity19 to find him a role			0
now that @entity19 has been sacked as @entity4 manager , the club will do everything they can to fit their former midfield player in to their coaching set - up as they look to retain a connection with the club ’s glorious past behind the scenes			1
with @entity4 set to appoint a foreign manager to replace @entity19 the club are concerned that ties with the past could be cut			2
@entity26 is now the club interim manager and will be retained whatever happens this summer but @entity45 could follow @entity19 out of the club after serving as a coach under the @entity75 while brother @entity76 and @entity77 are pursuing other careers			2
@entity4 had no plans in place to reintroduce @entity50 to the coaching staff while @entity19 was in charge and a source close to the club revealed to @entity44 last month that the situation was unlikely to change			0
@entity50 teamed up with @entity42 to help his former team - mate coach the @entity4 youngsters for the @entity90 youth league in the autumn but this arrangement was on a purely voluntary , non-contracted basis			0
it was orchestrated by @entity42 , rather than @entity19 , and it remained a temporary role			0
last summer , @entity50 turned down the chance to play a leading role on @entity19 ' staff , citing a wish to spend some time with his family before making his return to football			0
no 2 : @entity42 has been promoted from coach of @entity4 's under 19s to assistant boss in @entity26 new interim regime returning hero ? @entity50 at the @entity109 last month ( left ) and with @entity42 at the class of 92 film premiere ( right ) is wanted back by the @entity4 board that 'll have to come down : the ' @entity115 ' banner at @entity8			1

this time former manager unlikely to be *consulted* over appointment
@entity4 , keen to keep links with @entity1 era , appoint @entity26 as *caretaker*
club court @entity124 over potential return to fold
@entity45 to remain part of back - room set up at @entity8
