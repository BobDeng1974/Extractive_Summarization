the @entity0 raked in £ 3.4billion in inheritance tax last year , up £ 1billion since 2009			1
most of the money came from levies imposed on transfers of wealth when people died			2
it comes amid a growing political row about the taxes which should be levied on people when they die			2
@entity12 is under pressure to deliver on his pre-election promise to increase the level when inheritance tax kicks in			1
under pressure : prime minister @entity12 , who yesterday invited @entity18 into @entity19 to mark their 100th anniversary ( pictured ) , promised to increase the inheritance threshold before the last election but it was dropped when the coalition was formed in 2007 the @entity25 said they would raise the threshold to £ 1million at the next election			1
but the promise was quietly dropped when the coalition with the @entity30 was formed in 2010			1
new figures yesterday showed that in 2013 - 14 the @entity0 clawed back £ 3.4billion in inheritance tax , up 10 per cent in a year			1
since the financial crash in 2008 , the amount has soared by 20 per cent or £ 563million			1
increase : new figures from @entity36 yesterday showed £ 3.4billion was raised from inheritance tax , the highest figure since before the financial crash @entity39 has an inheritance tax threshold of £ 325,000 but an increasing number of people are having the value of their assets diminished as the threshold has n’t been kept in line with house price rises			1
earlier this year the @entity48 warned that the proportion of estates hit by death duties was set to double from almost one in 20 to nearly one in ten during the next five years			2
a new political row emerged this week over plans to impose additional taxes on estates to pay for social care			2
speaking out : @entity58 said recently : ' it 's good to tax the dead as they do n't vote ' @entity58 , a former guru of @entity62 leader @entity61 , recently joked that @entity62 should introduce a ‘ death tax ’ to pay for long - term care – because the dead ca n’t vote			2
@entity58 spoke out in favour of plans mooted by the party which could see everyone charged up to 15 per cent of their estate to pay for rising care bills			0
the academic , who was given a peerage by the @entity62 leader , said : ‘ it ’s good to tax the dead as they do n’t vote ’			0
at the same conference , the party ’s spokesman for civil society , @entity78 , said she thought a compulsory levy on people ’s estates was a ‘ reasonable idea ’			0
the @entity25 have accused @entity62 of wanting to resurrect a ‘ death tax ’ to pay for social care			0
health secretary @entity88 has often said he would like to see a compulsory levy to pay for elderly care			0
last month he told another @entity92 conference that he wanted @entity62 to ‘ embrace ’ a system where social care is funded by a tax on estates when people die			0
mr @entity88 said @entity62 was holding ‘ internal discussions ’ about the tax , which it is understood would be levied on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax			0
he said a tax on estates would act as ‘ insurance ’ for people who fear punitive care costs when they get older			0
he said it would only be possible however , @entity62 insists it is not party policy to increase levis on people at death			1
health secretary @entity112 said : ‘ people who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if @entity62 were ever to get in			0
‘ our priorities are different : legislation to protect people from sky - high care costs and sensible incentives to encourage people to save for their own needs			0
’ homebuyers paid more than £ 5billion in stamp duty last year , with @entity126 and those on the outskirts of the capital footing most of the bill			1
of the £ 5.1billion which @entity131 estimates homebuyers spent in 2013/14 , @entity126 paid £ 2.2billion and those who bought in the ‘ @entity136 ’ area £ 962million			1
‘ @entity147 ’ includes places such as @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , north @entity143 , south @entity144 , @entity145 and the @entity146			0
controversial tax : homebuyers paid more than £ 5billion in stamp duty last year , with @entity126 and those on the outskirts of the capital footing most of the bill by comparison , the total paid in the @entity156 was £ 69million , £ 70million in @entity158 and £ 148million in both @entity159 and the @entity160			1
figures released separately yesterday by @entity36 also show two - thirds of homebuyers are paying the controversial tax			1
the two sets of figures highlight the government ’s failure to increase stamp duty thresholds – the level at which the tax is charged			1
until 1997 , stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for £ 60,000 or more			1
today it is charged at one per cent only on properties between £ 125,000 and £ 250,000 and three per cent on those worth up to £ 500,000			1
rates continue to rise to a maximum of seven per cent on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
if the thresholds had been increased at the rate at which house prices are rising , the three per cent band would begin at £ 645,000 , rather than £ 250,001			2
the report also reveals the huge disparity between the number of homes bought in each area compared to the amount they are paying in stamp duty			2
of the 830,000 properties bought in @entity192 and @entity158 in 2013/14 , 14 per cent were in the capital , but @entity126 paid 42 per cent of all the money paid in stamp duty			0
@entity195 , chief economist at @entity131 , said : ‘ variation in house prices has a strong impact on how much stamp duty is paid across different regions of the @entity39			0
‘ some regions contribute a much greater share of the total stamp duty revenues than their share of housing transactions might suggest			0
’ overall , @entity131 said the average house price is £ 188,949 after rising 0.1 per cent in july			2
@entity208 of estate agents @entity207 said : ‘ @entity211 prices are not falling off a cliff			0
they are currently having a welcome “ pit - stop ”			0

amount raised rises by £ 1billion since 2009 , @entity36 figures show
*tories* promised to increase threshold to £ 1million before the last election
but when coalition was formed in 2010 , pledge was quietly dropped
