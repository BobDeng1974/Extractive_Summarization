we 've long been told that the main risk factor for type 2 diabetes is obesity			1
now , however , scientists have discovered a lack of sunshine increases the risk of diabetes more than weight			0
a new study has warned people who have low levels of vitamin d are more likely to be obese and more likely to have type 2 diabetes			1
they are also more likely than people with normal vitamin d levels to have pre-diabetes - a condition which means a person 's blood sugar is elevated			1
if left untreated , they are likely to develop type 2 diabetes within a decade			1
a lack of the ' sunshine ' vitamin d - rather than being obese - raises the risk of diabetes , researchers say			0
the vitamin plays a role in how the body metabolises sugar their risk of metabolic syndrome - a medical term for a combination of diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity - is also increased			1
metabolic syndrome puts a person at greater risk of heart disease , stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels			1
the new @entity48 study found it was a deficiency in vitamin d - dubbed the ' sunshine vitamin ' - rather than what a person weighs that increased their risk of diabetes			2
this is because there was a direct link between low vitamin d levels and how the body metabolised glucose			2
obese people who did not have diabetes or another blood sugar disorder had higher levels of vitamin d than the participants with diabetes			2
likewise , lean participants with diabetes or another pre-diabetes disorder were more likely to have low levels of the nutrient			1
@entity75 helps control calcium that keeps bones and muscles healthy and regulates the immune system , which could help prevent diseases such as eczema and asthma			0
@entity75 is formed under the skin in a reaction to sunlight , but small amounts are also found in foods like eggs and oily fish			0
one billion people worldwide are estimated to be deficient in the nutrient most of the nutrient is formed under the skin in a reaction to sunlight , but small amounts are also found in foods like vitamin - d - fortified milk , oily fish and eggs			0
yet one billion people worldwide are estimated to have deficient levels of vitamin d due to a lack of exposure to sunshine			2
dr @entity104 , of the @entity105 , @entity48 , said : ' our findings indicate that vitamin d is associated more closely with glucose metabolism than obesity			1
the number of children with vitamin d deficiency has soared by more than 200 per cent in five years because parents are unaware how important it is for health , a study revealed			0
it also exposed a ‘ worrying ’ lack of knowledge by gps and health workers about the government ’s guidelines on the vitamin			0
public health officials are advising parents to give their children supplements and fortified foods			0
this is to avoid a return to ‘ @entity136 ’ levels of vitamin d deficiency , when the bone - softening disease rickets was common , they said			0
@entity137 such as oily fish , eggs and mushrooms naturally contain vitamin d , but many cereals and some dairy products are fortified with the vitamin			0
skin exposure to sunlight from march to october also produces vitamin @entity75 ' the study suggests that vitamin d deficiency and obesity interact synergistically to heighten the risk of diabetes and other metabolic disorders			1
' the average person may be able to reduce their risk by maintaining a healthy diet and getting enough outdoor activity			0
' the study , published in the @entity161 's @entity160 , clarifies the connection between vitamin d , obesity and diabetes			2
@entity166 , of the same university , added : ' the major strength of this study is that it compares vitamin d levels in people at a wide range of weights , from lean to morbidly obese subjects , while taking whether they had diabetes into account			1
' it compared vitamin d biomarkers in 148 participants who had their @entity180 measured and tested for diabetes , pre-diabetes or no blood sugar disorders			2
researchers measured levels of vitamin d in the participants ' bloodstreams and levels in fat tissue			0
obese people who did not have glucose metabolism disorders had higher levels of vitamin d than those who were diabetic			1
lean people with diabetes or another glucose metabolism disorder were more likely to have low levels of vitamin @entity75 therefore , vitamin d levels were directly correlated with glucose levels , but not with @entity180 , the researchers concluded .			1

study : @entity75 levels are more closely linked with diabetes than obesity
people with low levels of vitamin d more likely to have type 2 diabetes
also more likely to have pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome
@entity75 is ' more closely linked with glucose metabolism than obesity '
