by @entity0 a woman who suffered six miscarriages has finally given birth to a baby girl - thanks to egg yolk			1
@entity6 , 23 , from @entity7 , suffered six miscarriages in as many years before almost abandoning hope completely that she would ever have a baby			1
but thanks to pioneering treatment involving injecting egg yolk into her system , ms @entity6 has now successfully gave birth to @entity16			1
@entity6 , 23 , gave birth to a healthy daughter - @entity16 - after suffering six miscarriages in six years ms @entity6 , who has a degree in forensic psychology , said : ' finally having her in my arms is indescribable			1
when she was born i cried my eyes out			2
' every time i got pregnant i thought it would be different			0
i spent thousands on baby clothes and equipment for six babies that were never born			0
' it was to the point where people would n’t dare tell me they were pregnant because they did n’t want to upset me			0
i did n’t find out about my brother ’s baby until it was four months old			0
' even with the treatment i barely believed that my baby would make it , it was always " if " she made it			1
ms @entity6 was told her miscarriages were caused by ' killer cells ' in her body attacking the embryos ms @entity6 had pioneering egg yolk treatment which involved injecting her with a solution containing egg yolk to suppress the ' killer cells ' and allow @entity16 to develop ' now i ’ve got @entity48 i feel so lucky			1
she ’s already spoiled rotten			0
' ms @entity6 suffered her first miscarriage when she was just 17 and studying for her @entity50			1
she found out just hours before her exams that she had lost the baby			0
the treatment is given to suppress natural killer ( @entity55 ) cells in a woman 's body , the theory being that some women ’s bodies are non-baby - friendly and their immune system attacks the embryo as if it were a foreign body			1
@entity64 — a mix of soya - bean oil , egg yolk , glycerine and water — are a fat emulsion used as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for post-operative patients and premature babies requiring nutrition into their bloodstream			2
they have also been found to have an immuno - suppressant effect			0
the theory is that the intralipids have a stabilising effect on cell membranes , which makes it harder for the killer cells to attack and go on to cause implantation failure and miscarriage			1
the fats are highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose , the equivalent of a @entity92 bar — and have been likened to ‘ getting an armful of mayonnaise ’			0
administered via a drip usually twice before conception , and then three more times after , the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally			2
alongside this , women are also recommended to take steroids , which further suppress the immune system , and blood thinners to prevent blood clots , which also can impede embryos implanting			1
she said : ' i became pregnant by accident , but by the time i had a miscarriage i had come round to the idea of having a baby			0
' then i knew i wanted to be a mum and was determined to keep trying for a baby			0
' but it always ended in heartbreak			0
the consultant at the hospital told me the hardest part of having a baby was getting pregnant , but i could do that bit , i just could n’t keep the baby			2
' when i went to the hospital each time it was like they knew me			0
@entity127 , my nurse , was fantastic			0
it was like she was going through it with me			0
' but as time went on and i began to hate my body for what it was doing to me and my babies			0
' after hearing about a new treatment available privately , desperate ms @entity6 turned to the internet to find out more			1
there she found out about @entity138 , a fertility specialist at @entity139 , who was offering the pioneering treatment			1
ms @entity6 underwent a womb biopsy and was told the reason she kept miscarrying was because of ‘ killer cells ’ that kept attacking the embryo			1
she was treated using intralipid liquid , a mix of egg yolks and saline solution , which suppresses the ' killer cells ' and allows the baby to grow			1
she said : ' we had to pay to have the treatment privately			2
luckily , my mum was able to help out and she put the costs onto her credit cards			0
' with the other babies , i started preparing for their arrival			0
i probably spent thousands on clothes and things , but i did n’t dare with @entity16			1
' even on the way to be induced i still kept saying if the baby comes , it was never when			0
ms @entity6 says that during her pregnancy with @entity16 she was terrified of suffering another miscarriage so she took lots of vitamin supplements and avoided exercise ' i did n’t exercise and i took vitamins every day - i would line them up in the morning			1
' thankfully the treatment was successful and @entity16 was born at weighing 4lbs 14ozs on january 17 this year			1
she said : ' having six miscarriages definitely takes its toll , on my body and my mind			2
' but i know i want more than one baby and now i know the treatment works			2
' i want other women to know that this treatment is available , maybe it can work for them too			2

@entity6 , 23 , had six miscarriages in six years
she was told she had ' killer cells ' that attacked the embryos
