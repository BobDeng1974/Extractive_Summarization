this past weekend was a typical one for @entity1 ’s best golf coach @entity0 and his @entity3 - based academy			1
on friday , a party of 20 disabled kids visited , including a gifted autistic player who has a decent chance of representing @entity8 in the next @entity9			2
on saturday , more than 100 kids took their first steps towards taking up the game , hitting balls on the range			2
and then , on sunday , a gang of thugs broke in through the roof and basically , in @entity0 ’s words , ‘ trashed the place ’			1
it was the sixth such burglary in six months			1
and it ’s left @entity0 wondering what on earth is the point of carrying on			1
@entity0 looks relaxed on the driving range during the @entity26 in january @entity27 chats with golf instructor @entity0 ( right ) during a practice round at the @entity29 in june 2013 for some time @entity0 has been badgering his local council to do something about a derelict car park at the bottom of the academy that would help secure the premises but , as the whole country has learned recently to its horror , unfit for purpose happens to be this council ’s specialist subject			1
still , they ’re not alone			2
@entity0 ca n’t get help from anybody			1
imagine in tennis if they had someone with his track record ? imagine an academy that produced players as good as @entity50 , who currently leads the race to @entity52 , and @entity53 , the only @entity54 in the last 100 years to win the @entity55 ? @entity50 tees off during the first round @entity57 in @entity52 in january picture a @entity59 tennis coach so good he pulled off the equivalent of tutoring the top three the last time @entity62 was staged at @entity63			1
this is a man whose teaching skills are so respected 11 of the 12 players who contributed to @entity1 ’s @entity69 victory at @entity70 last year were coached or asked for his help at some point			1
the untold largesse the @entity75 would lavish in his direction			0
in golf ? ‘ i ’ve been in touch with the various bodies but when you ask for help it falls on deaf ears , unfortunately , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i ’m not looking for any massive handouts			0
i do n’t think you produce great sportsmen and women that way			0
but we do need a helping hand			0
‘ my fear is golf is dying at grassroots level			1
if places like mine are forced to close , what hope is there ? ’ young talents such as @entity53 ( above ) have come through @entity0 's academy @entity0 wrote to the minister for sport , @entity101 , and local government minister , @entity102 , without reply			1
but he was cheered slightly by a response from the prime minister ’s office			1
‘ the letter said @entity108 shares my concern , which is a start , perhaps , ’ said the @entity106			0
if truth be told , everyone should share his concern			0
the @entity113 might just be the most successful sports academy in @entity59			2
it is located in a part of the country that desperately needs some help			0
and it might close ? is there not somebody of influence in golf or politics who ca n’t see the blindingly obvious here , and why this simply must not be allowed to happen ? @entity128 must explain open call rarely in 30 years writing about golf can i recall an announcement provoking the depth of anger that has followed the @entity136 ’s decision to take live coverage of @entity62 away from the @entity138			1
indeed , you ’d probably have more luck finding business ceos who support @entity142 than golfers who think our leaders have got this one right			0
i ’ve had emails from readers asking me to organise petitions , even a boycott of this year ’s @entity29 at @entity63			2
at my local club on saturday , the verdict was unanimous			0
‘ even my friends who are @entity128 members think it ’s a dreadful decision , ’ said one influential member , who really would know plenty of @entity128 types			1
@entity128 chief executive @entity158 ( above ) is under - fire for the decision to take @entity62 away from the @entity138 meanwhile , it was announced last week that when the @entity29 is held on the @entity163 this year , those living on the @entity162 will be able to watch live , prime - time coverage on free - to - air television of all four days for the first time			1
now that ’s what you call a favourable television deal			2
a good time , therefore , to be heading to the @entity128 ’s headquarters at @entity63 on @entity172 to meet under - fire chief executive @entity158 to hear his side			1
stay tuned , as they say			0
@entity175 has paid tribute to @entity177 ( above ) who passed away on sunday quote of the week ‘ @entity177 was one of the greatest family men i have had the fortunate blessing to meet			0
he had such wonderful balance to his life and there was always much more to him than golf			2
but as a golfer , he was a fantastic player , and never got enough credit for being one			0
when i looked up at a leaderboard , i was n’t just looking for @entity191 or @entity192 or @entity193			0
i was also looking for @entity177			0
’ @entity175 pays tribute to the great @entity196 golfer , who passed away on sunday			0
@entity177 was married to @entity197 for 62 years , and they raised 11 children and 71 grandchildren and great grandchildren			0
in the era of the @entity203 , he won three majors and 51 times on the @entity206 to be ranked seventh on the all - time list .			2

@entity0 's @entity3 - based academy was broken into at the weekend
it was the sixth such burglary in six months
@entity0 is one of @entity1 's best golf coaches
his academy produced talents such as @entity50 and @entity53
the @entity136 ’s decision to take live coverage of @entity62 away from the @entity138 has provoked a *furious* reaction from fans
