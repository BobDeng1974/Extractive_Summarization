@entity1 's racing career appears to be over after her owner 's racing manager said she would probably be at @entity6 's @entity5 stud in little over three weeks			1
trainer @entity7 had floated the possibility of one final run for the dual @entity11 winner in either the @entity12 ' or @entity13 immediately after the filly 's dramatic triumph at @entity16 on sunday			1
but the proposal never seemed more than wishful thinking and @entity19 , spokesman for the sheik @entity21 racing admitted as much			0
@entity1 crosses the line two lengths in front of second placed @entity25 to seal dramatic victory at @entity16 @entity19 said : ' it is almost certain she will be retired			1
she has done enough and has nothing to prove			0
to win the @entity31 twice is remarkable			0
' she has come out of the race well and is 100 per cent this morning			0
i imagine she will go to the @entity21 's ( @entity36 ) stud @entity34 in about three weeks			2
' @entity1 's @entity31 win was all the more dramatic coming after what had previously been a winless and disappointing season but @entity42 - @entity7 always retained faith in her filly			1
@entity1 leaves the chasing pack for dust en route to another victory at the @entity49 @entity19 added that although no firm plans for which stallion @entity1 will visit first had been made , there had been discussions and it will be surprising if the name @entity55 did n't feature in those talks			2
@entity1 's success completed a great weekend for @entity6 when the only major disappointment was the last place of his @entity61 - trained @entity60 in the @entity62			1
his colours were also carried to success at @entity65 by @entity66 at @entity67 , by @entity68 and by @entity70 's @entity69 in the @entity71 at @entity72 is also destined for stud and only seems likely to run again if the ground for @entity75 at @entity67 turns soft and he has to stand in for stablemate @entity77 in the @entity79			2
@entity80 , riding @entity1 ( c ) celebrates after crossing the finish line to win at the @entity16 race track in the aftermath of @entity31 win , the @entity21 broke records by paying £ 5.25million for a @entity88 yearling filly subsequently named @entity89 at the premier @entity92 sales in @entity65			1
those sales start again today and @entity92 will be hoping the cash will again by flying			0
@entity19 said : ' @entity21 has no plans to be there but his team will be			0
' @entity80 sheds a tear after riding @entity1 to the first back to back wins at the event since 1978			0

@entity1 's career could be over despite her dramatic victory at @entity16
owner 's racing manager says she *'ll* be at @entity6 's @entity5 stud in little over three weeks
trainer @entity7 had floated the possibility of one final run
