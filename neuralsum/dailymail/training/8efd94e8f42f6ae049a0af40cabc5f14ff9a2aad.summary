by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 it is one of the most famous phone calls of the summer , a conversation that lasted less than two minutes but went viral on the internet			0
being granted an audience with @entity10 could lead some to get an inflated sense of their own worth but , as you listen to @entity14 relay the story of the day he and @entity17 chatted with the @entity18 , one thing is quickly apparent			1
@entity20 ’s goalkeeper may have found requests for autographs and pictures increasing , while the days when he could slip back to @entity24 and relax in relative anonymity may be over , but this episode has not changed him one bit			1
@entity28 save : @entity20 and @entity24 goalkeeper @entity14 was @entity24 's star player during the @entity29 in @entity30 @entity31 : @entity24 president @entity10 had a conversation with @entity14 to congratulate him success : @entity24 goalkeeper @entity14 was telephoned by president @entity10 after the @entity29 ‘ i ’m fortunate because 99.9 per cent of people do n’t get to speak to him , ’ says @entity14 , as he revisits the events that took place after the @entity24 ’s interests in the @entity29 were ended by @entity39			1
‘ i ’ve met the president once before when we went to the @entity44 , so to speak to him was really cool			2
‘ he watched it with his family and his daughters			0
he said he was proud of us and the team effort and it was exciting , thrilling , he was on the edge of his seat			2
it was cool that he was so excited			0
‘ i think i played well against a real tough @entity39 team but i ’m an old dog , i do n’t get too excited			2
in 2010 we lost in the round of 16 and in 2014 we lost in the round of 16			0
we were poo - pooed then and we ’re celebrated now			2
but we still lost in the round of 16 , so it ’s all a little bit lost on me			0
‘ we lost a game of football which we could have won at the end			2
we missed a golden chance and could have done it but i still do n’t get caught up in all the mass hysteria			0
’ @entity14 chose to reveal this week that he is taking a break from international football to spend more time at home after 12 years of criss - crossing the @entity69			1
if it is good news for his family , it is also good news for @entity20			1
new season : @entity14 has returned to @entity20 and is hoping to have a successful campaign on @entity77 record : @entity14 has kept 116 clean sheets since signing for @entity20 in 2006 from @entity80 form : @entity14 is playing the best football of his career and is hoping to continue that with @entity20 this season as he showed during that breathless journey in @entity30 , when his saves almost took the @entity24 to the last eight , @entity14 is operating at his peak , thriving from long hours in the gym and reaping the benefits of the @entity90 , which advocates eating lean meat and fish while avoiding dairy and grain foods			1
@entity14 intends to retire when his current contract with @entity20 expires in four years ’ time - the ambition is to finish , if possible , after one last hurrah at the @entity29 in @entity98 - but before then , there are targets to be met			1
his 116 clean sheets since moving from @entity80 in 2006 are the fourth best figures in club history - another five will move him beyond the fabled @entity105 , who played for @entity20 before and after the @entity106 - while his durability and consistency will almost certainly take him into the top 10 most appearances before his time is done			1
above all , though , there are ambitions for the team as a whole			2
@entity20 came within a whisker of qualifying for the @entity118 last season and the club has spent big this summer , smashing their transfer record for @entity121			1
@entity14 knew that would happen soon after @entity121 had ended his interest in the @entity29			1

it was heartbreaking to lose but i was oddly happy for him			0
‘ i believe in him and love him as a person			0
he is not arrogant , he is a good person			0
we talked about our family , we did n’t talk about the game , we were just standing there trying to drink water , your mind is racing , he is looking forward and i am looking back			0
‘ we spoke a little about what was next , he said he had had some good conversations with @entity153 ( @entity154 ) so i was encouraged by that			0
i wanted to go cry in the locker room and he wanted to celebrate			0
‘ as much as i felt his joy , he felt my pain			0
we both peed and we left			0
i do n’t think he needed me to tell him ( how much we wanted him to sign ) , he had spoken to the manager — we made our case last year			2
i did n’t have to beat him over the head			0
’ @entity121 was instrumental in april ’s 3 - 0 demolition of @entity127 and he will have a major role to play on saturday evening when @entity164 brings his side back to @entity77			1
that performance set the barometer for what @entity20 can do under manager @entity154 and @entity14 wants more of the same			1
‘ we switched things up last season and really hurt them , says @entity14			1
