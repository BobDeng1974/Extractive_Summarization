by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 11 august 2012 updated : 01:57 est , 12 august 2012 the government ’s failure to crack down on @entity4 ’s benefits cheats has been exposed in a damning tv documentary			1
the programme shows one young man filling in his @entity9 ’s claim form by copying down his weekly shopping list			1
another submits a cv and application letter as evidence that he was trying to seek work , yet both clearly state he does not want a job			2
in both cases , the claims were passed			2
working the system : @entity23 's undercover reporter @entity22 , pictured driving with @entity24 , said it was ' all too easy ' to cheat the benefits system @entity27 , 25 , uses a hidden camera to show a @entity30 adviser in @entity31 rubber - stamping his claim for @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , having failed to spot that it was a simply a list of food items			1
claimants over 25 can receive up to £ 71			0
mr @entity27 , who was working undercover with television reporter @entity22 , said : ‘ i ’m supposed to write a list of 14 things i ’ve done each week to find work but no one ever bothers to check it , so it was no surprise when i submitted my shopping list instead and they did n’t even notice			1
’ he graduated in 2009 from @entity45 , where he read genetics , but has been signing on ever since			0
he says he is becoming increasingly disillusioned with the system			0
‘ we do all that is asked of us but what is the point if they are just going to ignore it ? ’ says mr @entity27			0
‘ this shows just how easy it is to stay on benefits if you want to and begs the question how seriously staff actually take their role in finding people like me work			2
’ in order to obtain @entity33 , claimants must enter into an agreement with an employment officer to highlight the attempts they have made to find work each week			1
the terms can vary from centre to centre			0
but the system ’s potential for farce is further highlighted by 30 - year - old unemployed events manager @entity24			2
under the terms of his agreement , he has to apply for three jobs each week and then show his adviser , via his mobile phone , copies of what he sent			0
however , working with @entity22 , he altered the copies to say he did n’t want the job because he preferred to stay on benefits and changed the last line of his cv so it read : ‘ please do n’t give me the job , i do n’t want it			0
’ yet the adviser at his @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 , did n’t spot the glaring anomalies			1
' farce ' : the programme shows @entity27 writing a shopping list out on his claim form for @entity33 - the claim was passed ‘ she scrolled through my emails on my mobile and my claim was passed for another week , within five minutes of me walking in , ’ says the @entity103 graduate , who had been out of work for five months when the film was made			1
in april this year , deputy prime minister @entity106 praised @entity90 , claiming that they offered the unemployed the chance to either ‘ earn or learn ’			1
but with more than 2½ million unemployed in @entity4 and a further 500,000 school and university leavers about to flood the job market , the documentary casts serious doubt on their effectiveness			2
the cost of people working cash - in - hand while still fraudulently claiming benefits runs to more than £ 226 million a year and @entity30 staff are seen as the first line of defence			2
yet when mr @entity24 goes into the @entity90 to sign on wearing paint - splattered overalls and looking like a professional decorator , his adviser readily accepts that he ’s painting his bedroom			1
' satisfied ' : @entity127 , the chief operating officer of @entity30 , said she was satisfied staff were doing enough to get people into work @entity131 , who worked as a @entity30 adviser until last year , admits : ‘ filling out a fraud referral form can take time , so unless you ’ve got a very supportive manager and unless you ’ve not got a busy diary , you ’re going to be tempted to just let it go under the carpet			0
when i was there , not enough fraud referrals were being done			0
’ mr @entity131 adds that if he were out of work and keen to find a job , he would n’t start at the @entity90			1
he said claimants were often penalised for using their initiative , meaning many of those who had , for instance , secured unpaid work experience would have their benefits stopped			0
‘ there is no guidance on this			0
you do get to this ludicrous situation where somebody has found themselves a great opportunity , and the @entity90 just does n’t know how to process it			1
most of my colleagues would err on the side of caution and they would classify internships as work			0
@entity127 , chief operating officer for @entity30 , claims there is plenty of help available for @entity4 ’s unemployed but admits : ‘ i am disappointed we have n’t picked up the silly mistakes that @entity27 and @entity24 highlighted			0
but i am satisfied that @entity30 is getting people into work and ensuring they meet their responsibilities			0
’ she appears baffled when asked why 127 jobs based in @entity30 itself are advertised on neither the centres ’ terminals nor their own website			0
she later said that @entity90 staff knew about them and could pass the information on to claimants			1
but says @entity179 @entity180 : ‘ @entity30 seems ill - equipped to do what it was set up for , which is to find people jobs			1
‘ from our discussions with @entity27 , @entity24 and many other job - seekers , if you want to , it is still all too easy to cheat the system			2
’ dispatches : tricks of the @entity191 , @entity179 , tomorrow , 8pm .			1

a @entity179 documentary shows @entity90 advisers failing to notice *deliberately* farcical entries on claim forms for @entity33
one *jobseeker* featured on the programme says ' no - one bothers ' to check his forms
