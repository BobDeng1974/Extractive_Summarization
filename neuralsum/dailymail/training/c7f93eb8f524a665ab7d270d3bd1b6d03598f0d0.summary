a prominent @entity1 woman launched a she - said , she - said battle over wages on wednesday morning by accusing the @entity4 of paying women less than men – just hours after president @entity7 begged @entity8 to outlaw the practice			1
high - stakes gender politics made an appearance in tuesday 's @entity13 address when the president insisted that ' @entity8 still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work			1
' ' really , ' he said to cheers from @entity21 on @entity22			0
' on wednesday morning former @entity26 ceo @entity25 claimed ' the president has n't really led in this regard			1
he 's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own @entity4			2
' ' he 's not paying women equally , ' former @entity26 ceo @entity25 ( left ) said of the president , during a morning - show joust with @entity4 adviser @entity35 ( right ) president @entity7 made a point of mentioning pay equity for women in his @entity13 speech , a political dog - whistle that motivates @entity21 voters but is subject to widely varying interpretation the line brought applause from @entity21 but not much enthusiasm from @entity1 , who ' wo n't stand – literally – for pay equity , ' according to some wags on @entity48 @entity25 , herself a potential 2016 presidential candidate , glossed over details from the administration 's annual report to @entity8 on @entity53 that show women are paid equally for the same work but are n't trusted with as many high - level jobs			1
she aired her complaint on @entity60 's @entity59 program , where she faced off against top @entity7 adviser @entity35			2
' every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required , ' @entity25 said			1
' i also think it 's just a fact that laws exist on the books today , and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender , she should use the full extent of that law			0
' let 's unpack your question a little bit			0
... in the @entity4 women do earn equal pay for equal work , ' she said			1
@entity7 's salary data show that male white - collar @entity4 employees earn an average of about $ 88,600 , compared with $ 78,400 for females			1
that 13 per cent wage gap is in line with the federal government as a whole , according to the @entity92			0
but it 's larger than the overall gap in the @entity95 , which the @entity96 reports is 9.9 per cent			0
nationally , women in the @entity98 earn 23.5 per cent less than men			2
that number , like the @entity4 's , results in large part from women holding more junior - level jobs with lower salaries			1
fewer men take time away from their careers to raise children , giving them access to continued career advancement and salary growth			0
and some researchers point to trends in women 's employment that suggest many mothers accept lower wages in exchange for better health benefits and greater flexibility in working hours			0
that may be one reason why 87 men in the @entity4 earn six - figure salaries , something only 53 women on @entity7 's staff can say.compared to 53 female @entity4 officials			1
the @entity4 's 2014 report also showed that there are two more men than women in the highest - ranking positions			1
@entity25 's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment			2
but the longtime tech executive , who ran an unsuccessful bid for a @entity142 @entity98 > @entity141 seat in 2012 , hinted during the on - air tussle that her real target was labor unions and their preference for seniority - based pay systems			0
' the single greatest impediment to equal pay for equal work is this seniority system , which pays not on merit , not on performance , but on time and grade , ' she claimed			1
' and who is it who supports the seniority system ? unions , government bureaucracies , the vast majority of constituencies that the @entity21 party represents and who support the @entity21 party			0
' paying women ' by merit and by their results , ' @entity25 insisted , would result in a system where ' women will be paid equally			2
' @entity25 , a onetime @entity98 @entity141 candidate in @entity142 , now lives in @entity173 and is weighing a presidential run in 2016 @entity74 is among the @entity176 ' oldest friends from their @entity177 days , and is seen in @entity95 as a political ' fixer ' who has the president 's ear more often than his @entity183 secretaries @entity74 fired back that @entity7 's @entity13 barb about pay equity was a reference to the @entity187 , a bill that @entity1 have consistently blocked since 2009			1
the @entity189 supports the measure , saying it would allow judges to take a close look at companies ' pay practices to be sure any gender disparities ' serve a legitimate business purpose ' and spring from ' factors other than sex			0
' business advocates and their @entity1 supporters , however , maintain that there is a broad list of reasons why some women earn less than some men			0
in 2009 the @entity98 @entity206 commissioned a study from the @entity208 that counseled the government on how to interpret wage data from the @entity98 census and other sources			0
it found that ' differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors			2
' ' the differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers , ' the report concluded			0
the @entity227 already makes it illegal to pay women less than men for performing the same job in the same company .			2

former @entity26 chief @entity25 *blasted* @entity7 *confidante* @entity35 over the president 's @entity13 demand for pay equity
@entity4 pays women on average 13 per cent less than men – but *technically* gives equal pay for equal work
salary differences are *due* to more men than women having higher - paying @entity4 jobs
@entity25 is a potential 2016 presidential candidate
