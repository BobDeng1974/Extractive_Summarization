by @entity0 published : 13:21 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 05:41 est , 25 june 2013 scientists believe they are closer to solving the mystery of why leprosy suddenly declined in @entity5 500 years ago			1
@entity6 used to be one of the biggest killers across the continent with victims being cast out of towns and villages			2
it is still found in 91 countries worldwide and infects 225,000 people each year but in @entity5 it suddenly declined in the sixteenth century			1
the scientists used metagenomics to describe the open - ended sequencing of @entity20 from samples taken from the @entity23 mummy			2
a similar approach was used by another group of scientists to recover a leprosy genome from skeletons ( pictured ) a few weeks ago one of the most popular theories as to why it declines was that the pathogen evolved and lost its virulence			2
but scientists have now been able to discard the theory after discovering that the pathogen found today in the @entity36 and other parts of the world is virtually identical that that of medieval @entity5			1
the discovery , made after genetic analysis of @entity42 , the leprosy pathogen , recovered from @entity44 bones in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , suggests that @entity5 developed a natural resistance to the disease			1
in a study published in the journal @entity50 an international team of researchers concluded : ‘ the sudden decline of leprosy in 16th century @entity5 was almost certainly not due to the medieval @entity5 strain of @entity42 losing virulence			1
‘ extraneous factors such as other infectious diseases like plague or tuberculosis , changes in host immunity or improved social conditions may have accounted for its decline			0
’ in @entity5 sufferers were outcasts and had to ring bells to warn others of their approach			1
in 1873 @entity75 physician @entity74 identified @entity42 as the pathogen that caused the disease			0
in the 1970s multi-drug therapies were developed as a cure			0
symptoms can take 20 years to appear			0
of the 3.3 million chemical letters found in the modern pathogen ’s genome , just 20 were different to the @entity44 version , said dr @entity85 , a paleogeneticist at the @entity86 in @entity87			0
‘ if the explanation of the drop in leprosy cases is n't in the pathogen , then it must be in the host , that is , in us ; so that 's where we need to look , said dr @entity96 , director of the @entity97 in @entity98			2
‘ in certain conditions , victims could simply be pressured not to procreate			0
in addition , other studies have identified genetic causes that made most @entity5 more resistant than the rest of the world population , which also lends credence to this hypothesis			1
’ he said it remains unclear if leprosy was taken to the @entity36 by @entity5 or the other way around but it is likely it spread during the @entity113			1
‘ we did n't have the data to determine the direction in which the epidemic spread , ” said dr @entity96			0
‘ the pathogen could have been carried to @entity120 during the @entity113			0
but the process could have operated in the opposite direction , as well			0
’ the leprosy pathogen was especially well preserved in the bones of this 25 - year - old woman from @entity47			2

@entity45 and other @entity5 thought to have built up resistance to leprosy
@entity130 still infects 225,000 people every year across 91 countries
