by @entity0 last updated at 12:27 pm on 16th september 2011 it 's an iconic image that captured the free spirit of the hippie movement			2
a pretty , long - haired , semi-naked young woman stands amid her friends , playing air guitar , lost in the music at an open - air festival			2
but now more than three decades on the woman in the shot has revealed she was n't a drug - taking hippie chick of easy virtue , but a straight - laced married woman looking for something to do			1
the picture was taken at a music festival in 1978 shortly after @entity18 , now 67 , moved away from her home city of @entity20 in @entity21 to @entity22			1
rocking spirit : @entity18 , originally from @entity20 , was the subject of an iconic image thanks to this old rock festival photograph that epitomised the free spirited summer of love ' i seemed to be photographed at pop concerts every time i went , ' she said			1
' i used to wear unusual clothing with lots of colours - i still do but i 'm trying to tone it down now i 'm older			2
' i did n't take drugs ... i was very straight			1
i went to pop concerts for something to do ' ' the photo could have been taken anywhere between 1975 and 1982			1
' i think it was at @entity42 while dancing to a band like @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 - it could have been any band like that			2
' i used to love music when i was at school			2
' the teacher used to tell us to close our eyes when listening to a piece of music so you can hear it properly and not get distracted by what 's going on around you			0
' i still close my eyes now when listening to a new record			0
' sometimes the photo is used with the wrong story , like drugs or promiscuity , that insinuates all sorts of things i do n't like			1
' i did n't take drugs , i was too naive			1
and i was n't even promiscuous			1
2011 : @entity18 more than three decades on aged 67 was a long haired , scantily clad woman in her youth ' i had been married for a few years at that time			1
i went to pop concerts for something to do			1
' ms @entity18 was the eldest of eight children , five girls and three boys , and grew up in @entity77 , @entity20			1
she got married to an @entity20 man and moved to @entity22 after her divorce aged 25 , where she made a living as a dress maker			0
@entity18 enjoyed watching bands such as @entity44 today she lives in @entity84 with her partner of 12 years and has raised three daughters			1
she regularly visits @entity20 , where her mother and two sisters still live , and can recall the times her dad used to take her and her brothers and sisters to watch @entity92			0
' when i divorced i started going to rock concerts as a way of trying to pick myself up off the floor , ' she said			1
' it was a kind of freedom after being brought up strictly and convent educated			0
' i used to go to @entity42 and @entity99 a lot to listen to various bands			0
' i ca n't remember them all			2
i remember it was a really hot day and people started to sunbathe topless			0
' i looked like the odd ball with my clothes on			0
all the girls were going round with their tops off so i did the same			0
' i could n't believe i was the one who was photographed			1
it was the happiest time of a my life			2
it was all love and peace			0
' there was no violence like there is now			0
' ms @entity18 said she worked for a time as a @entity120 dancer in @entity22			1
she also spent a year living in a bus in @entity122 sitting on the side of the road selling beaded headbands			0
' i used to get recognised in and around @entity126 near where i lived , ' she said			0
' even the bread delivery man noticed me			0
' i seemed to get photographed all the time			1
every time anyone sees a photo of me i try to get a copy			2
and a friend 's son found quite a few pictures of me on a hippie website			0
' she added : ' i 'm shocked that the photo has been used this long			0

' i was too naive for drugs and was n't at all promiscuous , ' says @entity18 , now 67
