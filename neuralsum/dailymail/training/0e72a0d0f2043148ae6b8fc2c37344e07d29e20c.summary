@entity0 might be known internationally for its academic prowess , but it is gaining attention for advocating a healthy approach to women ’s bodies too			2
a photo project , called ' @entity7 ’ done by the @entity9 team exploring what sport and community mean for their bodies and identities has become an online hit			1
featuring members of the team dressed in simple grey shorts and sports bras , they write on their own bodies , and those of their teammates , the things that they admire or appreciate			1
the inspiring project sees the women with words like ' powerful ' and ' big heart ' written across their bodies the team wrote what they loved and appreciated about each player on their body the project also show the comradary and sisterhood that exist within the team the group say that rugby ' necessitates a strength that we find beautiful and powerful ' the team say that their sport helps their positive body image			1
' @entity9 is so much about physically throwing your body on the line for your teammates during games and training ' the @entity0 team pride themselves in the strength and power of their bodies on the pitch the uplifting photos see the girls covered in affirming words like ‘ strong ’ , ‘ open heart ’ , ‘ powerful , ‘ ripped ’ and ‘ battle scars			1
’ they also show the comradary and sisterhood that exist within the team , with shots showing them laughing together , hugging and standing arm in arm			0
on the @entity7 tumbler site they explain : ‘ we asked teammates to write what they loved and appreciated about each player on their body , in the hopes of opening a visual discussion about beauty , strength , and appreciation			2
' we decided to have players write their favorite things about other players physically on their bodies to demonstrate the immense body positivity , encouragement of strength and utility , and the overall supportive nature of this team			2
‘ @entity9 is so much about physically throwing your body on the line for your teammates during games and training , and that intense appreciation , love , trust , and support for each other is what we wanted to reflect			0
the sport necessitates a strength that we find beautiful and powerful			0
’ the project ascertains that for a woman to love her body is a political statement two players happily show off their impressively muscular biceps , with the words ' huge ' and ' ripped ' written on despite being very simple , the photos mange to convey a powerful message and have gone viral online the project says that mass media is sending girls the message that only slender , tall bodies are beautiful statements written explore the positive attitude of the women , and not necessarily the appearance of their body parts the uplifting photos see the girls covered in affirming words and statements alongside the photo project , three members of the team wrote an essay for the @entity128			1
@entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 say in the piece , entitled ‘ an exercise in @entity134 ’ that : ‘ loving one ’s body is an inherently political act			0
maintaining pride in having a body that is “ too big , ” “ too small , ” or “ not ideal ” is a political statement against the many voices that tell us our bodies are problematic			0
‘ mainstream culture normalises the flawless bodies that dominate every kind of mass media , sending girls the message that only slender , tall bodies are beautiful			0
