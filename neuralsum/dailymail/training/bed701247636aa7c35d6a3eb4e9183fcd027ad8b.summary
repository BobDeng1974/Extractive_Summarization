an animal charity has slammed a cruel owner who dumped a puppy in a hedge on a freezing night with a note around its neck which read : ' please look after me as my owner does n't want me '			2
the 14 - month - old spaniel - pointer cross was locked in a cage and left in a bush by the roadside near @entity12 , @entity13			1
luckily , a passer - by found the abandoned pet before he starved or froze to death , after hearing his yelps for help from the undergrowth			2
dumped : @entity21 , a 14 - week - old spaniel - pointer , was discovered in a hedgerow next to a road with a sign around his neck , begging : ' please look after me ' attached around his neck was the note , written in a childish scrawl , which continued : ' i 'll try to do my best to keep you happy			1
' his previous owners had left a selection of brand - new equipment needed to look after a new pup , including a bed , dog food , dog training paraphernalia and a teddy bear			0
the unwanted animal is now being looked after by the @entity42 which blasted his former owners			2
the charity 's inspectors believe the dog was an unwanted @entity49 present which was dumped when the novelty wore off			1
@entity51 unwanted : a note left beside the unloved dog found in @entity12 , @entity13 , and written in a childish scrawl , read : ' my owner does n't want me anymore			1
i 'll try to do my best to keep you happy ' @entity42 inspector @entity58 said : ' i have no doubt in my mind that this was an unwanted @entity49 present			1
' it is a perfect example of why we urge people to think very carefully before buying pets as presents			0
' every year animals are abandoned when the novelty of having a dog or cat wears off			0
' pets are a lifelong commitment and anyone taking one on needs to be very sure there is a long - term commitment to properly care for the animal - and that he or she will be loved for life			0
' insp @entity58 said it was strange that a brand new rehoming pack had been left with @entity21			2
' i ca n't quite get my head around how someone could dump this really incredibly cute dog in this way			0
' on the one hand , they seemed to care due to the note and the careful way all the dog - related goodies had also been left , ' he said			2
' on the other , it 's just so callous			0
cruel : an @entity42 inspector thinks @entity21 was an unwanted @entity49 gift because he was dumped along with new equipment , pictured - including a bed , dog food , dog training paraphernalia and a teddy bear ' he was left hidden by a residential street where he could easily have been ignored or missed and on a very cold night			1
' temperatures being what they were he would have been really ill if left there overnight			0
' lucky for him i think he must have been spotted quite quickly as his toys were still really clean and had obviously not been rained on			0
' @entity21 was taken into @entity42 care after being thoroughly checked over and found to be in good health			1
he will have his initial inoculations before being put up for rehoming after being found on monday			0
anyone with any information about how and why poor @entity21 was so heartlessly dumped should call the @entity42 on 0300 1234 999 .			1
