by @entity0 published : 13:29 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 13:46 est , 14 november 2013 a strain of bird flu that scientists thought could not infect people has been discovered in a @entity6 woman			1
the news has sparked fears that such strains could ignite a new global outbreak if scientists do n't do more to spot them early on			2
the woman , 20 , was hospitalized in may with a lung infection but was released after being treated with @entity12 and antibiotics			1
prevention : a worker injects a chicken with vaccine at a hennery in @entity18 , east @entity20 's @entity19 in attempt to stop bird flu spreading amongst the animals one of her throat swabs was sent to the @entity25 and experts there have identified as the @entity29 bird flu , which has been widely circulating in chickens on the island			1
the patient , who was not identified , worked in a deli and had no known connection to live birdsaccording to research published online today in the journal @entity37			0
investigators could n't explain how she was infected but they noted several of her close family and friends also developed flu - like symptoms after spending time with her , though none tested positive for @entity29			0
since the @entity48 bird flu strain first broke out in southern @entity20 in 1996 , public health officials have been nervously monitoring its progress - so far it has killed more than 600 people , mostly in @entity51			1
worried : @entity20 authorities have been looking at ways to cope with outbreaks of bird fly since it was first discovered in 1996 , here a @entity20 worker sprays disinfectant in a chicken coop in @entity59 in east @entity20 's @entity19 province several other bird flu strains , including @entity62 , which was first identified in @entity20 in april , have also caused concern but none has so far mutated into a form which can to spread easily among people			1
@entity67 , a virologist at the @entity68 and the environment in the @entity70 a commentary accompanying the new report			0
she wrote : ' the question again is what would it take for these viruses to evolve into a pandemic strain ? ' she also said it was worrying that scientists had no early warning signals that such new bird flus could be a problem until humans fell ill. scientists often monitor birds to see which viruses are killing them , in an attempt to guess which flu strains might be troublesome for humans - but neither @entity29 nor @entity62 make birds very sick			2
@entity67 called for increased surveillance of animal flu viruses and more research into predicting which viruses might cause a global crisis			0
fear : @entity20 authorities have been trying for years to work out how to prevent and cope with the possibility of a large scale bird flu outbreak here , nurses take part in a drill with a dummy on the outbreak of bird flu inside an isolated room at a hospital in @entity107 ' we can surely do better than to have human beings as sentinels , ' she wrote			1
her comments come as two pharmaceuticals separately reported encouraging results from human tests of a possible vaccine against a different type of bird flu that has been spreading in @entity20			1
the @entity62 bird flu that has infected at least 137 people and killed at least 45 since last spring and is feared to have pandemic potential			2
scientists from @entity123 , in @entity124 , @entity125 , say tests on 284 people suggest that after two doses of the vaccine , most made antibodies at a level that usually confers protection			2
' they gave a third of the usual dose and yet had antibodies in over 80 percent , ' said an expert not connected with the work , dr. @entity137 of the @entity138			0
' this is encouraging news			0
we 've struggled to make vaccines quickly enough against novel viruses , ' he said			0
their results were published online wednesday by the @entity147 and just a day later their news was echoed by @entity150 - based @entity149 who announced early tests on its @entity62 vaccine in 400 people showed 85 percent of them got a protective immune response after two doses .			0

the woman , 20 , was hospitalized in may with a lung infection but was released after being treated with @entity12 and antibiotics
but scientists testing her swabs have now discovered that she had @entity168 strain of bird flu
since the first strain of bird flue was discovered in @entity20 in 1996 more than 600 people have died , mostly in @entity51
