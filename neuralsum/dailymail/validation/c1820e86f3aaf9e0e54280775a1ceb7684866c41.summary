@entity3 ’s monster hit @entity4 has made a profit of more than $ 16 million since it became the biggest song of 2013 , an @entity1 court heard on tuesday			1
the song , also created to @entity8 and @entity9 , is currently at the center of a legal battle over copyright infringement and the song ’s alleged similarity to @entity16 ’s 1977 funk / disco classic @entity15			1
the financial profitability of a song is typically a highly guarded secret and tends only to be revealed when the track is at the center of a $ 40 million lawsuit			2
that was divided with $ 5,658,214 going to @entity3 , $ 5,153,457 to @entity8 , $ 704,774 to rapper @entity9 and record companies pocketing the remainder			0
during opening arguments in the case , @entity37 , the attorney representing @entity16 's children @entity35 and @entity36 had tallied the alleged damages at approximately $ 40 million			1
besides seeking profits — including a claimed $ 4 million from 50 percent of the publishing earnings of @entity4 — the @entity44 are seeking damages for a reduction of the fair market value of the worth of licensing @entity15 , reports the @entity49			1
the singer ’s children @entity35 and @entity36 are also targeting touring money too , with about $ 11 million attributable to the song 's success			1
strangely , the @entity55 filed the claim to counter a suit filed in august 2013 by @entity3 , @entity9 and @entity8 in which they asked a judge to declare that the song did not infringe on @entity36 's copy written work			1
changing story : @entity3 claims now he only said that he was inspired by @entity16 's song to make it sound like he was involved in writing his hit , when in fact @entity8 did ( seen here with model @entity68 ) @entity3 is arguing that he did n't rip off @entity16 's 1977 song got ta @entity71 for mega hit @entity4			1
@entity16 is pictured here in 1983 - one year before his shooting death the @entity44 also claim that @entity3 and his estranged wife @entity75 's co-written track @entity76 stole its sound from their father 's song after the dance			2
that song , according to more testimony brought home $ 895,374 in profits			0
earlier in the trail , @entity3 had entertained the court when he danced and played keyboard from the witness stand to show that a number of pop songs have the same chord progression including @entity93 's @entity92 , ‎ @entity95 's @entity94 and @entity97 ' @entity96			0
according to court papers filed last year , @entity3 said he was high on painkillers and alcohol when @entity4 became a hit , and he exaggerated his contribution to writing the song			2
@entity3 , 37 , said in a deposition in april that he had been largely absent during the composition of @entity4 , due to being under the influence of opioid painkiller @entity108 mixed with alcohol			0
' i had a drug and alcohol problem for the year and i did n't do a sober interview			0
so i do n't recall many things that i said , ' @entity3 said in the deposition			0
he added that he was no longer taking @entity108			0
the song was created by @entity118 artist and producer @entity8 , who said in deposition two days before @entity3 's that he had composed the melody and written the lyrics for the hit , and that @entity3 had ' embellished ' the origins of the song			0
the previously sealed depositions were filed in @entity1 federal court in may in connection with a lawsuit by the estate of late soul singer @entity16 against @entity3 and @entity8 , accusing them of stealing from the @entity134 legend 's 1977 song got to give it up .			2
