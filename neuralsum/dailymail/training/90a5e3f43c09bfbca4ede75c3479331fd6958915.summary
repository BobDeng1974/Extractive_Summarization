the national security adviser , @entity0 , said on sunday she was not ' 100 percent correct ' in her remarks after the deadly 2012 attack on a @entity4 compound in @entity5 , but called it patently false to say she intentionally misled @entity4 about the incident			1
on @entity10 's @entity9 , @entity8 said that when she made statements about the attacks that killed four @entity4 , including that they were ' spontaneous , ' she was simply sharing ' the best information she had ' at the time			1
@entity8 was the ambassador to the @entity14 at the time and the comments met with backlash , with @entity19 lawmakers accusing the @entity20 of downplaying the attacks ahead of the presidential election			1
no regrets : @entity0 said on @entity9 that she never meant to downplay the @entity25 attacks @entity19 critics were not satisfied with her explanation , with senator @entity28 proclaiming himself ' almost speechless			1
' on september 11 , 2012 , an attack by militants at the @entity4 mission in @entity25 killed @entity4 ambassador @entity32 and three other @entity4			1
just days later , @entity8 appeared on news shows and stated that the attack was the spontaneous work of a crowd angry about an insulting video that denigrated @entity38 , instead of a pre-planned attack by @entity41 militants			0
when @entity8 's 2012 account proved incorrect , @entity19 lawmakers accused her of trying to protect @entity44 during his re-election campaign , which the @entity20 disputed			2
' i commented that this was based on what we knew on that morning [ and ] was provided to me and my colleagues - and indeed to @entity51 - by the intelligence community			0
and that 's been well validated in many different ways since , ' she said			0
terror attacks : a vehicle and the surrounding area are engulfed in flames after it was set on fire inside the @entity4 consulate compound in @entity25 late on september 11 , 2012 former job : @entity0 was the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity14 at the time of the attacks ' and that information turned out , in some respects , not to be 100 per cent correct			1
but the notion that somehow i or anybody else in the administration misled the @entity4 people is patently false			0
' @entity8 said she did not have any regrets about the 2012 comments			2
she also said the @entity4 remains committed to catching the perpetrators of the attack			0
' and we will stay on it until this gets done , ' she added			0
amid the fallout from her 2012 remarks , @entity8 withdrew her name from consideration later that year to be nominated as @entity44 's second - term secretary of state , and former senator @entity87 got the job			2
instead , @entity8 was appointed national security adviser , which does not require @entity92 confirmation			1
appearing on the @entity95 program ' @entity93 , ' @entity28 said @entity8 in 2012 was reading from talking points that were ' absolutely false			0
' ' and of course , the information was totally misleading , totally false - and for @entity0 to say such a thing , i think , it 's a little embarrassing , to tell you the truth , ' he added .			0
