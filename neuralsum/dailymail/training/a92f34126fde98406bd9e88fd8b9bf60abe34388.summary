@entity0 , who did not testify in his own defense during the guilt or sentencing phases of his trial , will also have the right to speak , though he is under no obligation to do so			1
@entity0 's trial evoked memories of the darkest days in recent memory in @entity46 as victims testified of being hurled through the air by the twin pressure - cooker bombs , struggling to save the lives of those who had lost limbs amid screams of pain and fears that additional explosions would follow			1
@entity56 , 8 , 23 - year - old @entity58 exchange student @entity57 and 29 - year - old restaurant manager @entity59 were killed in the attack			1

@entity18 has given @entity0 's lawyers until august 17 to file any post-trial motions along with all supporting material			2
just three of the 74 people sentenced to death in the @entity16 for federal crimes since 1988 have been executed			1
the first was @entity96 , put to death in june 2001 for killing 168 people in his 1995 attack on the federal government office building in @entity101			2

confession : @entity0 's defense do not dispute that he ( left in white cap ) and his brother @entity83 ( right in black cap ) carried out the bombing destruction : one of the two explosions at the marathon is pictured above			2
three people died from the bombs and hundreds were injured @entity0 may not be executed for his crimes for another 18 years , experts have claimed			1
at 21 , he is the youngest inmate on @entity124			0
but he could be 40 by the time he put to death by lethal injection			0
this is due to the appeals process , which will likely take years for @entity0 's legal team to exhaust			2
indeed , the bomber 's defense attorney has already indicated she wants to take full advantage of it			0
@entity135 has argued it was prejudicial to her client to hold the trial in @entity46 , @entity139 , and that her team was given ' insufficient time ' to prepare their arguments against the death penalty			0
legal expert @entity144 said of @entity0 's time on @entity124 : [ @entity146 ] may be the youngest inmate on death row at 21 but he could be pushing 40 by the time they march him to the death chamber			1
‘ we are looking at 18 years , possibly longer , before his appeals process is exhausted			0

' if he had gotten a life sentence , this would be over with			0
' the jury 's decision does not mean that @entity0 's death is imminent			2
@entity16 district judge @entity18 , who presided over the trial , will formally sentence @entity0 to death at a yet - to - be - scheduled hearing sometime in the next few months			1
defense attorneys are likely to appeal the decision , which will trigger more legal wrangling before any sentence can be delivered			0
