smartphones will be sending and receiving scented messages by the end of next year , experts say			2
the concept is one of ten emerging technologies forecast by innovation charity @entity7 to make it big 2015 , with others including life - saving apps and food waste feeding millions of people			1
it comes six months after scientists managed to send the smell of champagne and macarons from @entity19 to @entity20 with an @entity22 app using a device called the @entity24			1
new technology : six months ago scientists managed to send the smell of champagne and macarons from @entity19 to @entity20 with an @entity22 app using a device called the @entity24 ( file picture ) the system consists of an @entity33 app which allows users to create an @entity35 with a smell created out of a palette of 32 available scents that can be combined in 300,000 possible combinations			1
the @entity35 can then be sent to the @entity41 hardware - a device which is able to recreate the smell			1
other technology in this field is the @entity47 device , which can release a favourite aroma at the same time as a phone clock alarm or when an individual receives a text message			1
it also claims to be able to change the taste of food with its mini air - freshener - like alcohol - based aroma cartridges			1
a user can select to emit a puff of scent at will using the small plastic device			2
@entity62 computing professor @entity61 developed the technology behind @entity64 and is now working on a device that will send a magnetic signal to a mouthguard in the back of the throat			2
@entity22 attachment : a @entity47 device can release a favourite aroma at the same time as a phone clock alarm or when an individual receives a text message @entity7 project manager @entity76 said : ‘ imagine the next selfie you see posted is accompanied by the scent of perfume			1

@entity87 was a system created in 1960 by @entity89 , and was used in cinemas during the film @entity91			0
the system was fitted to cinema seats and released 30 smells at different points during the film , triggered by the film 's soundtrack			0
in 2013 , researchers in @entity102 developed a prototype smelling screen			0
the smelling screen combines a digital display with four small fans , one at each corner of the display			0
smells are stored in gel packets and are released at set times			0
the smells are blown parallel to the screen			0
by varying the speed and strength of each fan , the different smells are moved to specific areas of the screen			0

in 2015 , i predict that the ability to digitally transmit smells will hit the mainstream			0
' it has been more than half a century since the concept of ‘ @entity87 ’ was introduced to cinema audiences , making its first widespread appearance in the 1960 film @entity91			0
the film opened in three specially - equipped theatres in @entity20 , @entity136 and @entity137 - with the idea being that certain odours would be timed to specific points in the narrative			2
but the mechanism did not work properly and audience members complained of a hissing noise accompanying the scents - as well as a delay between the actions and their corresponding smells			1
mr @entity76 added : ‘ while we ’ve turned our noses up at past attempts , i believe 2015 is the year “ smell - o - vision ” will finally lose its stink			1
’ another prediction is of a huge innovation in first aid that will see ambulance trusts incorporate smartphone technology locating local trained first aiders , who can respond instead of paramedics			2
it is also claimed that in 2015 enough fruit and vegetables will be diverted from food waste to feed millions of people , through ' gleaning ' harvest food that would be otherwise left to rot in farms			1
of @entity7 's ten 2014 predictions , one of the most interesting is that there would be an ' introduction of services that help us improve our lives based on the data that we give away every day ' .			2

scientists sent smell of champagne from @entity19 to @entity181 with @entity22 in june
@entity24 device can recreate smell out of palette of 32 available scents
and the @entity22 attachment can release aroma upon receiving text
