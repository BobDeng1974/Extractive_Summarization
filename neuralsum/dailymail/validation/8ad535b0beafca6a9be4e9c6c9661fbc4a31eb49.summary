@entity1 ’s euro - flops flipped the hand - wringers into overdrive , like a @entity5 - style dash for their favourite hobby horse as soon as @entity8 ’s fate was sealed in @entity9			1
winter breaks , possession statistics , revenue streams , what ’s your poison ? or any other hell - in - a - handcart issue which is about to bring down our national game			1
two years in three without a team in the @entity21 quarter - finals is a worrying trend and the @entity23 will lose its cherished four - team party invite if it can not be reversed			1
@entity26 's @entity8 side struggled to impress as they crashed out of the @entity21 to @entity9 @entity27 ( left ) missed a penalty as @entity8 were eliminated 3 - 1 on aggregate by the @entity31 giants @entity8 's defeat would have been much worse if not for the superb form of goalkeeper @entity34 ( right ) there is no @entity1 presence in the @entity37 either after @entity39 ’s harsh lesson in @entity40 on thursday night			1
yet in @entity42 , a similar debate is unfolding because @entity43 are the @entity45 ’s sole representatives in the last eight , two years after @entity43 and @entity46 contested the @entity21 final at @entity48 and nine months after the @entity50 triumph			2
‘ there is no time to rest , no time to ease off , ’ said @entity51 , president of the @entity42 fa			0
‘ we have to keep at it if we are to remain at the top			0
’ in @entity1 , the usual excuses were aired but it is to be hoped the big clubs are looking at what they might do to improve as well as grumbling about how the system is stacked against them			2
there is no @entity1 presence in the @entity37 after @entity39 ’s harsh lesson against @entity67 @entity68 scored his eighth @entity70 goal of the season , but it was n't enough the @entity67 players celebrate during their impressive 6 - 4 aggregate victory over @entity39 too many games ? let ’s start with the favourite complaint of the managers who overlook how the extra income from the @entity21 should improve their squad , if spent wisely			1
besides , who has the most games ? @entity9 have played 44 to @entity8 ’s 42 this season , @entity84 44 to @entity85 ’s 45 and @entity86 played 45 to @entity87 ’s 44			1
@entity88 has played 3,531 minutes for @entity9 and @entity89 3,323 for @entity90 , while @entity91 has played 3,326 for @entity86 and @entity92 3,539 for @entity84			1
it ’s more intense in @entity1 , they say			2
no easy games , more physical , no respite			0
well , it always has been this way			0
@entity98 helped @entity85 knock @entity84 out at the last 16 stage following a 1 - 1 draw in @entity101 @entity98 celebrates victory with team - mates @entity103 ( right ) and @entity104 at the final whistle @entity106 looks defeated during @entity84 's last 16 exit at the hands of @entity85 last week it was in the 1970s when @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 were winning the @entity21 and it was in 2008 when @entity113 and @entity84 were in the final in @entity115 and half of the last eight were from the @entity23			1
the intensity of @entity1 football used to be considered an advantage with improved fitness and hardened minds			2
modern players may run more but usually on better pitches , with lighter balls			0
in fact , footballers have never had it quite so good			0
at the top of the @entity23 they have the best money can buy in terms of physical care from the moment they step into the academy building			2
but tell them they are tired and they might feel tired			0
in 2008 @entity113 and @entity84 were in the final in @entity115 and half of the last eight were from the @entity23 @entity92 has played 3,539 minutes for @entity84 compared to @entity89 's 3,323 for @entity90 when competition ends , touring begins			1
@entity143 will visit @entity144 in may			2
@entity145 were skiing in @entity146 earlier this month			0
@entity8 flew to @entity147 before returning to lose at home to @entity149 in the @entity150			2
@entity84 had two days off and a free week to prepare before they were knocked out of @entity151 by @entity85			1
the wrong type of football ? the competitive tempo which gives @entity1 football its appeal will never nurture a player like @entity158 , and yet all - action midfielders thrive in the domestic game , living on mistakes which rarely occur against the best @entity70 teams			1
this is perhaps most keenly felt at international level			0
only one @entity1 outfield player started for @entity8 in the @entity166 , and it was not all @entity169 ’s fault			1
city have a foreign team and a @entity173 manager			0
@entity86 have not subscribed to traditional @entity1 values for years			1
few pass the ball better than @entity177 ’s teams and few have played in the @entity21 with such regularity without winning it			2
few have passed the ball better than @entity177 ’s teams , but the @entity182 still struggle in @entity151 @entity177 's @entity86 teams have not subscribed to the traditional @entity1 values for years @entity169 was the only @entity1 outfield player to start for @entity8 against @entity9 on wednesday night @entity9 can mesmerise in possession , but it is four years since they made a final			1
in the 2010 semis , they lost to an @entity190 team that did not want to know the ball			0
it is about finding ways to win , which is what @entity84 were doing when they surrounded the referee against @entity85			2
since @entity197 won the @entity198 in 1965 , through the domination of @entity110 and into the renaissance led by @entity113 and maintained by @entity84 , @entity1 clubs have been successful with fast , aggressive football and spirited , well - balanced sides			1
in the past two years , our strongest teams have dipped			0
the @entity84 side first built by @entity206 is being rebuilt and the new model is not yet as good			2
@entity113 are in @entity209 turmoil , @entity86 are left short by the same old problems and @entity8 are still trying to learn what it takes			1
there are also the restrictions of @entity151 ’s @entity216 rules but @entity1 clubs do not want for income , thanks to a bumper television deal , which is about to get even bigger			1
money is not the problem			0
it guarantees nothing in any case			0
@entity90 spent a fortune chasing their 10th @entity21			0
it is about finding ways to win , which is what @entity84 were doing when they surrounded the ref against @entity85 @entity84 were the last @entity1 to to win the @entity21 , defeating @entity43 on penalties in 2012 it took them more than a decade because they became obsessed with superstars and forgot about the team			1
in @entity1 wealth confuses strategy			0
clubs have realigned for the @entity237 generation with sporting directors , finance experts and sports scientists involved in transfers while coaches are marginalised			0
the upshot ? squads lack balance and big - money investments sit on the bench because managers can not — or will not — accommodate them			0
what is @entity113 ’s recruitment strategy ? are @entity8 about to sack @entity251 and start again ? will @entity177 ever change his approach ? yes , a winter break might be helpful , as would the complete restructure of the @entity1 league system			1
and yes , it would be nice if @entity1 players could pass the ball , and clubs should invest in youth development until they can			0
but if our euro - flops are to flip and rule the @entity21 again , they must use their millions more carefully and build better teams			1
@entity90 spent a fortune chasing their 10th @entity21 , but it took time to get there city boss @entity251 is under pressure after his side 's @entity21 exit			0

it has been a terrible season for @entity1 sides in @entity151
@entity274 , @entity84 and @entity86 have all crashed out of the @entity21
@entity143 , @entity110 and @entity39 fell before the @entity37 last eight
@entity8 were beaten in both last 16 legs by @entity9
@entity86 suffered a shock 3 - 1 defeat against @entity87 at the @entity281
@entity23 managers have called for a winter break
