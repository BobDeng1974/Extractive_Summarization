‘ my love of the countryside was something i got from my father			1
my brother and i would ridicule him slightly , ’ he revealed to @entity35 magazine			0

my brother and i used to go , “ hmmm , yeah , sure , ok			0
” but of course he was right			0
‘ the rural issue that most annoys me is the inappropriate housing development			1

however , when those houses are provided , they must be provided with a view to our heritage			0
