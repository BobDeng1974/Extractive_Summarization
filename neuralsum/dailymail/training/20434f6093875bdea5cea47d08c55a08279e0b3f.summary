the @entity1 safety watchdog is to be given @entity3 - style independence from government to stop ministers ordering cover - ups of care failures			1
health secretary @entity8 said new powers would be rushed into law to stop officials from burying ' uncomfortable truths ' about failures in the health service			0
he said he wanted the @entity15 to act as the nation ’s chief whistleblower on health			1
watchdog : health secretary @entity8 , pictured ( right ) during a visit with @entity21 to the @entity22 , in @entity23 , @entity24 , unveiled plans to give the @entity15 independence in a speech to the @entity29 party conference in @entity24 , mr @entity8 announced he was giving up powers as health secretary to intervene what the @entity15 does			1
it means the @entity15 will not have to wait for ministers to order an investigation into a hospital or care home and the health secretary will not be able to dictate the content of its annual report			1
the new posts of chief inspector of @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , will also be enshrined in law			0
mr @entity8 said it was a major reform ' that will stop politicians ever attempting to suppress or cover up poor care again '			0
' we ’ll stamp out bad care wherever we find it - public sector , private sector , hospitals , care homes , surgeries - and never cover it up			1
' he added : ' as soon as @entity57 returns we will legislate to give the quality watchdog the statutory independence it so badly lacked under @entity60			0
' this means never again can ministers or political advisors lean on them to suppress uncomfortable truths , and never again will care failings be covered - up by managers dancing to their political masters ’ tune			1
' we will also put the new chief inspector posts in statute , so that patients will always have powerful advocates to speak up for them without fear or favour			0
' for the hundreds of families who suffered under a system that put political priorities first , we are determined to end the culture of poodle regulation , cover ups , and closing ranks when whistle - blowers and relatives try to speak up			1
’ surgeries : @entity21 said gps had to open later and at weekends to ensure patients get the care they need the move came as @entity21 called for gp surgeries to open seven days a week and outside office hours			1
the prime minister set out plans for the first wave of surgeries which will be open from 8am to 8pm every day , making it easier for patients who struggle to fit in visits with their family and work commitments			1
the move is a response to growing concern over the quality of out - of - hours care			1
@entity60 allowed @entity87 to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends as part of a botched deal which came into force in 2004			0
since then , private companies have taken over and in many cases have been forced to employ foreign doctors , many of whom have a poor grasp of @entity119			0
mr @entity21 told @entity121 's @entity120 : ' i think it is the right approach to look at this because obviously our accident and emergency departments do a brilliant job but they do have 4million more people going through them than was the case in 2004 , a lot of people going to accident and emergency really need a gp rather than accident and emergency , so i think this pilot scheme … is a very good step forward			2
' there will be a pilot scheme to start with fully funded , properly funded by the government and then we look to rolling it out across the country			0
i think it ’s a very good idea and it will also help hardworking people who want to go to see a gp but find it difficult to see a gp when they need to			0
' response : mr @entity21 's announcement comes amid growing concerns over over the quality of out - of - hours care			2
the prime minister wants surgeries to open between 8am and 8pm ministers say soaring attendances at over-burdened accident and emergency units have been exacerbated by the failure of doctors to provide a good service around the clock			1
the government is now creating a £ 50million fund that will be available to 50 practices across the country which will open next year			2
together , they are expected to cover half a million patients			0
ministers say the scheme would then be extended across the country			2
as well as seven - day - a - week access and evening opening hours , the new surgeries will also try out services to suit modern lifestyles , such as greater use of @entity181 , email and phone consultations			1
they will also offer electronic prescriptions and online booking of appointments , online registration and use the latest technology to enable remote ‘ tele - care ’ of the elderly and vulnerable			2
ministers say they will take a ‘ dim view ’ of applications for funding from practices which want to cover the extra opening hours with locum gps			1
‘ this is about family doctors finding different ways of working , perhaps with district nurses , ’ said a source			0
welcomed move : chairman of the @entity206 , dr @entity205 , pictured left , welcomed the announcement while chairman of the @entity210 , dr @entity211 , pictured right , described the plans as ' exciting ' the move will not require a renegotiation of the gp contract , though ministers are already seeking substantial changes to it			2
surgeries will be scored on access by the chief inspector of general practice , using @entity224 - style ratings , and ministers say patients will quickly come to expect access outside office hours and at weekends and ‘ vote with their feet ’ by switching away from surgeries which do n’t adapt			1
mr @entity21 said : ‘ millions of people find it hard to get an appointment to see their gp at a time that fits in with their work and family life			0
' we want to support @entity87 to modernise services so they can see patients from 8am to 8pm , seven days a week			1
‘ we also want greater flexibility , so people can speak to their family doctor on the phone , send them an email or even speak to them on @entity181			0
’ he said the government was looking at other ways of easing pressures on @entity255 , including opening more doctors ’ surgeries in hospitals			2
professor @entity259 , chief inspector of general practice , said : ‘ this move towards seven - day services is great news for patients , and should be embraced by @entity87			2
’ dr @entity211 , chairman of the @entity210 , said : ‘ this has the potential to be the most exciting development in primary care in the past decade			0
’ earlier this year , it emerged that doctors were being paid £ 1,350 a shift to work for @entity272 ’s biggest out - of - hours care provider , @entity274 , because managers were so desperate to cover evenings and weekends			0
dr @entity205 , chairman of the @entity206 , said : ‘ we welcome the announcement of £ 50million as a small first step towards redressing the massive under - investment that general practice has seen in recent years			0

new laws will see ministers lose power to control @entity15
