it is a fact that illustrates just how difficult the predicament is becoming for @entity2 : in 2015 , @entity3 have beaten more top flight teams than @entity5			1
such a swaggering and creative force 12 months ago , this campaign has become one long episode of domestic disappointment and , on one of those unforgiving , slate - grey @entity13 afternoons , the woes failed to relent against @entity15			2
@entity5 somehow scrambled a 2 - 2 draw against the @entity18 ’s basement team but on a day when they handed out @entity19 to fans to mark the 27th anniversary of @entity5 in the @entity22 , the club charity , @entity2 and @entity24 might have been left with red faces			1
@entity27 and @entity28 battle for the ball which ends up in the back of the net via the @entity15 player 's head an own goal by @entity15 's @entity28 under pressure from @entity27 in the 89th minute saw the game end in a 2 - 2 draw @entity27 looked desperate to score for @entity5 against @entity15 and helped make the goal that saw them steal a point @entity27 celebrates the equaliser that saw @entity5 and @entity15 share a point apiece in their @entity18 match @entity5 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity44 5 : @entity45 6 , stones 7 , @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 6 : @entity48 6 ( @entity49 55mins 7 ) , @entity50 7 : @entity51 6 , @entity52 5 ( @entity53 55 7 ) , @entity54 7 ( @entity55 85 ) : @entity27 5.5 subs not used : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 goals : @entity54 57 , @entity62 88 @entity15 ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity63 7 : @entity64 7 , @entity65 7 , @entity66 6.5 , @entity28 7 , @entity67 6.5 : @entity68 6 ( @entity69 62 7 ) , @entity70 7.5 , @entity71 8 ( @entity72 87 ) , @entity73 6.5 ( @entity74 62 7.5 ) : @entity75 6.5 subs not used : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 goals : @entity69 63 , @entity71 70 booked : @entity65 attendance : 38,940 referee : @entity84 7 how the @entity18 table looks here 's how @entity54 gave @entity5 the lead			1
click here for more graphics like this @entity44 , normally a figure of such composure and authority , made two uncharacteristic blunders that enabled @entity69 and @entity71 to give @entity15 a lead that they seemed certain to protect until , in the 88th minute , @entity28 put through his own goal			1
@entity54 had opened the scoring for @entity5 in the 56th minute but not once did they threaten to go through gears , as they did so elegantly in @entity2 ’s debut campaign			1
this run – two wins in 14 @entity18 matches since november 30 – is vexing their manager			2
‘ we need to find the enjoyment that we have in the @entity107 , ’ said @entity2 , who refused to point the finger of blame at @entity44			0
‘ we need to look forward to facing the opposition , as we do in @entity109 , and find enjoy the challenge of facing different teams			0
’ this @entity5 team is an enigma			2
having looked so confident when they have ventured into @entity109 , having scored 14 goals in seven games to take them to the brink of the last 16 , they have had no rhythm in the @entity18 and will not be threatening the top six come may			0
when @entity5 are on form , there is a pace and energy to how they go about their business but , from all on , you could see this was going to be one of those ponderous days to which they are prone , passing the ball from side to side without any conviction			0
an obvious , if rudimentary , tactic to profit here would have been to keep playing balls out to the right flank for @entity51 to scamper after , as neither @entity67 nor @entity28 had the pace to get within five yards of the on - loan @entity136 man			2
but , for some reason , they used it only sporadically and , as a result , @entity15 were comfortable			0
@entity5 rarely had a sight of goal – @entity52 wasted their best chance when blazing over – while the visitors came closest to breaking the deadlock through a curling @entity75 effort			1
@entity54 gave @entity5 the lead in the 57th minute but visitors @entity15 soon answered back in @entity13 @entity54 shoots to score the opening goal of the match for @entity5 in the 57th minute as the home side looked to steal three points @entity54 runs away in celebration as @entity5 took the lead before @entity15 got back into the game later @entity54 celebrates scoring for @entity5 as @entity2 's side aimed for a @entity18 win @entity5 players celebrate taking the lead after 57 minutes through @entity54 on sunday at @entity158 @entity159 started the second half confidently , too			1
they pinned @entity5 back and had @entity73 shown more composure , they would have taken the lead			2
instead , however , @entity159 fell behind in the 56th minute when @entity54 squeezed a shot past @entity63 via deflection off @entity66			2
teams at the bottom can lose heart in such circumstances but @entity15 ’s character can not be called into question and they roared back into the contest following @entity173 ’s decision to introduce @entity74 and @entity69			1
@entity74 is a terrier and his scuttling run down the right in the 63rd minute , beyond @entity47 , caused panic but the danger should really have cleared his cross but , instead , @entity44 inexplicably turned the ball into @entity69 ’s path and the boyhood @entity5 swept in the loose ball			1
that rattled @entity5 and a bigger calamity followed in the 70th minute when @entity44 completely misjudged @entity187 ’s cross , allowed it to drift into the path of @entity74 , who in turn gave @entity71 a chance he could not miss. @entity15 striker @entity69 scores his team 's first goal during the @entity18 match to equalise @entity69 knocks the ball into the net to equalise for @entity15 on sunday against @entity5 @entity69 runs away in celebration after getting @entity15 back into the game at 1 - 1 in the 63rd minute on sunday ‘ we have three players around him and it ends up with him , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ in football you are going to have errors but it is how you can help your team - mate when an action like that happens			0
' as a team we need to defend much better			0
i do n’t see @entity44 as directly responsible of the draw			0
’ the mood darkened around @entity158 , particularly when @entity27 fluffed two gilt - edged chances , but some form of redemption arrived in the 88th minute when @entity28 diverted into own net after @entity49 had crossed			1
it was harsh on @entity15 but @entity173 was phlegmatic			0
the dressing room is very disappointed , as you can imagine			0
we have got to turn these performances into wins , it is that simple , because of the predicament we find ourselves in			0
but in terms of the performance , it was full of intent			0
but we did n’t do enough to win			0
’ @entity71 scores to make it 2 - 1 to @entity15 against @entity5 at @entity158 on sunday afternoon @entity71 runs away in celebration after making it 2 - 1 to the visitors against @entity5 as @entity15 aimed for a shock win @entity71 celebrates with his @entity15 team - mates as the @entity18 club aimed for three points against @entity5 @entity15 sit bottom of the @entity18 but stole three points from @entity5 at @entity158 on sunday afternoon @entity5 manager @entity2 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity15 boss @entity173 ( right ) at @entity158			1

@entity54 gave @entity5 the lead at @entity158 in the 57th minute against @entity15
the visitors soon equalised through substitute @entity69 in the 63rd minute
@entity71 made it 2 - 1 to the @entity18 's bottom club in the 70th minute
a @entity28 own goal in the 89th minute denied @entity15 three *valuable* points
