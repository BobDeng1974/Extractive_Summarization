by @entity0 for @entity1 an @entity3 pet owner arrived home saturday to find his yard mobbed by an angry swarm of bees and his two 100 - pound dogs laying motionless in the dirt			1
@entity11 was horrified when he and a roommate saw the state of the beloved companions : one lay swollen and bloody while the other had ripped out his own claws in a desperate attempt to escape the fenced yard			1
before they could help the dogs , the two men were forced to flee as the bees they described as the nastiest they 'd ever seen turned their stingers on them			2
sad : these two 100 - pound dogs named @entity25 and @entity26 were killed saturday when a swarm of what may have been @entity28 killer bees modded their @entity31 , @entity3 yard tragic reminder : left behind were the carcasses of some of the bees , which chased away the dog 's owner before firefighters arrived to fight back the bees by spraying foam ' they were definitely not your average bee because most of them they 're not like that unless you really mess with them but these bees were a whole other breed , ' @entity42 told @entity53			1
@entity11 called 911 and firefighters soon arrived to spray the yard with a foam that would keep the bees at bay			1
it was only then when @entity11 realized the extent of his dogs ' -- named @entity62 and @entity25 -- terrible injuries			1
' i rushed them to the vet and they were both dead			0
these were both 100 - pound dogs			0
big dogs , ' the emotional pet owner told @entity71			0
the male dog , @entity25 , suffered the worst			0
' i 've seen the claw missing on his paw , he had gashes all over his head trying to escape from the backyard to get away from the bees			2
and the other one was really swollen , ' @entity11 said			0
it 's a sad time for @entity11 , but he 's thankful he and his roommate , who suffered just one sting , got out alive			0
' not your average bee ' : dog owner @entity11 ( left ) said he and his roommate @entity42 were forced to flee before they could get help for the dogs noble friends : @entity11 rescued @entity62 , right , years ago and had more recently come to own @entity25 , left @entity11 believes the trouble began when a neighbor plugged the entrance to a nest hidden inside a cement wall between their properties , which he believes caused them to swarm			1
africanized honey bees look identical to the native bees and it has yet to be determined which species killed @entity25 and @entity62			1
however , the so - called ' killer bees ' have been a serious problem in southern @entity3 for years			2
last year was especially bad in the area after three times as many people suffered 50 or more stings from the testy bees -- and the problem was even worse in nearby @entity109			0
back in 2011 , a southern @entity3 hog farmer watched in horror as thousands of bees swarmed a 1,000 - pound hog during an attack that lasted about two hours			0
horrific : @entity11 found evidence in the yard that the dogs desperately tried to escape the bees			1
@entity25 even ripped out his own claws in the process			2

@entity11 arrived to his @entity31 , @entity3 home saturday to find a swarm of *unusually* angry bees in his yard
motionless in the yard were his two large dogs @entity62 and @entity25 who 'd been desperately trying to escape the swarm
