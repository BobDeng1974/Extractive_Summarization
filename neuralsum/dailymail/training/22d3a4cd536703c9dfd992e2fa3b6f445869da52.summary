by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:37 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 14:29 est , 20 august 2013 @entity2 , the beloved crime novelist whose acclaimed best - sellers and the movies made from them chronicled the violent deaths of many a thug and con man , has died			1
@entity2 , winner of an honorary @entity9 in 2012 , died tuesday morning at his home in @entity11 , a suburb of @entity12 , from complications of a stroke			1
his researcher @entity15 announced the 87 - year - old ’s death and said that he was surrounded by family when he died			1
his millions of fans , from bellhops to @entity21 , made all his books since ' glitz ' ( 1985 ) best - sellers			1
when they flocked to watch @entity28 in the movie version of ' @entity30 ' in 1995 , its author became the darling of @entity33 's hippest directors			1
and book critics and literary lions , prone to dismiss crime novels as mere entertainments , competed for adjectives to praise him			0
each was characterized by moral ambivalence about crime , black humor and wickedly acute depictions of human nature : the greedy dreams of @entity55 in ' @entity56 , ' the wisecracking cool of @entity58 in ' @entity30 , ' @entity60 's lust for notoriety in ' @entity62			1
' 3:10 to @entity63 ' when something sounds like writing , i rewrite it , ' @entity2 often said ; and critics adored the flawlessly unadorned , colloquial style			1
as author @entity70 put it in a @entity73 book review , ' i did n't know it was possible to be as good as @entity2			1
' @entity2 spent much of his childhood in @entity12 and set many of his novels in the city			1
others were set in @entity80 near his @entity82 , @entity83 , vacation home			0
one remarkable thing about @entity2 's talent is how long it took the world to notice			1
he did n't have a best - seller until his 60th year , and few critics took him seriously before the 1990s			0
he had some minor successes in the 1950s and ' 60s in writing @entity94 stories and novels , a couple of which were made into movies			1
but when interest in the @entity94 dried up , he turned to writing scripts for educational and industrial films while trying his hand at another genre : crime novels			2
old school : @entity2 became best known for his crime novels that were adapted for films , like @entity30 , £ : 10 to @entity106 , and @entity107 the first , ' @entity108 , ' was rejected 84 times before it was published as a paperback in 1969			1
@entity33 came calling again , paying $ 50,000 for the rights and turning it into a movie starring @entity114 , that even @entity2 called ' terrible			1
' he followed up with several more well - written , fast - paced crime novels , including ' swag ' ( 1976 )			0
@entity2 was already following the advice he would later give to young writers : ' try to leave out the parts that people skip			1
' in 1978 , he was commissioned to write an article about the @entity122			0
he shadowed the cops for nearly three months			0
starting with ' @entity125 ' in 1980 , his crime novels gained a new authenticity , with quirky but believable characters and crisp , slangy dialogue			0
@entity130 , an editor at @entity131 , thought they deserved better and promised to put the muscle of his publicity department behind them			0
he delivered ; and in 1985 , ' @entity139 , ' a stylish novel of vengeance set in @entity138 , became @entity2 's first best - seller			1
@entity33 rediscovered him , churning out a succession of bad movies including the humorless ' 51 @entity143 ' starring @entity144			0
its director , @entity145 , failed to capture the sensibilities of @entity2 's work , and his ear missed the clever dialogue			1
it took @entity151 to finally show @entity33 how to turn a @entity2 novel into a really good movie			1
' @entity30 ' was the first to feel and sound like an @entity2 novel			1
back in the day : @entity2 started his career in advertising but then turned to crime writing , and while he was not initially met with much success , his later work became fodder for @entity33 ( pictured in 1983 ) then @entity161 took a turn with ' @entity163 , ' turning it into ' @entity164 , ' a campy , blaxploitation - style film starring @entity166			1
but @entity167 stayed faithful to @entity2 's story and dialogue with ' @entity107			1
' writing well into his 80s , @entity2 's writing process remained the same			1
he settled in at his home office in @entity11 , @entity173 , around 10 a.m. behind a desk covered with stacks of paper and books			2
he lit a cigarette , took a drag and set about to writing — longhand , of course — on the 63 - page unlined yellow pads that were custom - made for him			1
when he finished a page , @entity2 transferred the words onto a separate piece of paper using an electric typewriter			2
he tried to complete between three and five pages by the time his workday ended at 6 p.m. ' well , you 've got to put in the time if you want to write a book , ' @entity2 told @entity1 in 2010 of the shift work that was befitting of his hometown 's standing as the nation 's automotive capital			2
@entity2 had sold his first story , ' @entity198 , ' in 1951 and followed with 30 more for such magazines as ' @entity200 , ' earning 2 or 3 cents a word			2
at the time , he was working in advertising , but rose early to work on his fiction before trudging off to write @entity205 ads. one story , ' 3:10 to @entity106 , ' became a noted 1956 movie starring @entity207 , and ' @entity208 ' was made into a film the same year called ' the @entity211 ' but the small windfall was n't enough for @entity2 to quit his day job			1
( ' 3:10 to @entity106 ' was remade in 2007 , starring @entity214			0
) his first novel , ' the @entity216 , ' was published in 1953 , and he wrote four more in the next eight years			0
one of them , ' @entity218 , ' about a white man raised by @entity220 , was a breakthrough for the struggling young writer			0
when @entity223 bought the rights for $ 10,000 in 1967 , he quit the ad business to write full time			0
working til the end : @entity2 ( left ) worked on the television show ' justified ' starring @entity228 ( center ) ' @entity218 ' became a pretty good movie starring @entity231 , and the book was named one of the greatest westerns of all time by the @entity236			2
soon , another @entity94 , ' @entity237 , ' became a star vehicle for @entity239			0
but as the 1960s ended , the market for @entity241 fizzled			0
@entity2 wrote five more , but they sold poorly , and @entity33 had lost interest			2
@entity2 was born in @entity245 on october 11 , 1925 , the son of @entity247 executive @entity2 and his wife , @entity248			2
the family settled near @entity12 when young @entity2 was 10			2
the tough , undersized young man played quarterback in high school and earned the nickname ' @entity2 , ' after @entity254 , a knuckleball pitcher of the day			2
the ballplayer 's card sat for years in the writer 's study on one of the shelves lined with copies of his books			0
after serving in the @entity263 during @entity264 , he majored in @entity265 at the @entity266			0
he started writing copy for an advertising agency before his graduation in 1950			0
he married three times : to the @entity271 in 1949 , the @entity272 in 1979 and , at the age of 68 , to @entity274 in 1993			0
he had five children , all from his first marriage			0
his son , @entity277 , followed in his father 's path , going into advertising for years before achieving his own success as a novelist with his 2008 debut , ' quiver			0
' in 2012 , after learning he was to become a @entity9 lifetime achievement recipient , @entity2 said he had no intention of ending his life 's work			2
' i probably wo n't quit until i just quit everything — quit my life — because it 's all i know how to do , ' he told the @entity1 at the time			0
' and it 's fun			0
i do have fun writing , and a long time ago , i told myself , ' you got to have fun at this , or it 'll drive you nuts			0

author @entity2 made his name writing books that became *blockbusters* like @entity107 , @entity164 and @entity30
died on tuesday morning at age 87 from complications due to a stroke
