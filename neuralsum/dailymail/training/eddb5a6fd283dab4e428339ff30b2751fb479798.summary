we may soon be able to virtually explore our local universe in the same way we explore @entity3 - thanks to a new map of space that plots the location and flow of our nearest galaxies			1
the @entity9 was created by @entity10 from the @entity11 and a team of researchers			1
it attempts to map the universe up to around 3,000 million light years away from @entity3 including the the @entity17 and @entity18 galaxies			1
it attempts to map the universe up to around 3000 million light years away from @entity3 including the the @entity17 and @entity18 galaxies			1
the @entity25 , also known as the @entity25 contains the @entity26 and the @entity27			0
this @entity27 is centred around the @entity17 and @entity18 galaxies			1
at least 54 galaxy groups and clusters have been found within its diameter which is thought to be around 10 mega-light years wide			2
in 1982 astronomer @entity32 published research explaining the basic structure of the @entity25			0
his findings said the supercluster consists of two components : a flattened disk containing two - thirds of the supercluster 's galaxies , and a roughly spherical halo containing the remaining third			2
@entity10 , along with researchers @entity45 , @entity47 and @entity48 , has now produced a 17 - minute video explaining what the mapping shows us			2
@entity32 is also listed as a contributor and it was his 1982 paper that first presented the basic structure of the local supercluster of galaxies			1
@entity32 is an astronomer at the @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity21			0
the video is part of the @entity63 project			0
it is made up of various 3d representations of the local universe that the researchers animate , rotate , pan and zoom around during the video			1
the flat plain of galaxies is turned into a 3d representation in the video by @entity73 astronomers			1
each galaxy is colour - coded to signify distance from @entity3			0
the nearest galaxies are shown in dark blue and gather around the @entity26 ' equator ' and the @entity79 in the lower - left quadrant our local galaxy is visualised around the @entity26 equator - centred at the @entity17			1
the galaxies nearer this equator are densely populated , while empty spaces around these stars are called voids @entity10 also provides a commentary of what each graphic represents and points out areas of interest			2
each galaxy in the video is colour - coded to signify distance from @entity3			0
the nearest galaxies are shown in dark blue and gather around the @entity26 ' equator ' and the @entity79 in the lower - left quadrant			2
the most significant structures highlighted are the @entity99 next to the @entity100 , or @entity101 , supercluster			0
another graphic taken from the @entity105 video map shows velocity flow lines between the galaxies			2
high density regions of galaxies are shown in red while voids are shown in blue			2
in the video the region around the @entity113 and @entity114 clusters are densely populated so have many velocity flows the @entity25 contains the @entity27 ; made up of around 54 galaxies including the @entity17 and dwarf galaxies			1
its gravitational center is located somewhere between @entity17 and @entity120			2
the @entity27 covers a diameter of 10 megalight - years			0
the video then zooms in to show the galaxies nearest to @entity3 , including the @entity17 and the @entity120			1
by rotating the galaxies , the researchers were able to see that most of our nearest galaxies lie on a flat plain			2
in one graphic , rows are shown coming from each galaxy to show their relative distance from @entity3			0
galaxies that move in a deviant or peculiar way towards @entity3 are shown with dark blue arrows and deviant motions away from @entity3 are shown in red			0
in this cosmography graphic , rows are shown coming from each galaxy to show their relative distance from @entity3			0
galaxies that move in a deviant or peculiar way towards @entity3 are shown with dark blue arrows and deviant motions away from @entity3 are shown in red galaxies to the right of the @entity17 tend to have blue arrows while the ones to the left have red ones			1
the researchers claims this is evidence there is a flow of movement that picks up speed from right to left across our local galaxies			1
another 3d representation created by the researchers for the video shows velocity flow lines between the galaxies			1
high density regions of galaxies are shown in red while voids are shown in blue			0
voids are large spaces in the universe that do n't have any , or contain only a handful , of galaxies			2
in the video the region around the @entity173 is densely populated so is shown in red with many velocity flows travelling into it			0
the film then ends with a ' fanciful view of the supergalactic equator			0
' the left - hand image from the @entity105 map shows the layout of our closest galaxies with the @entity17 and @entity18 galaxies highlighted			1
the right - hand graphic shows the surrounding galaxies that make up a proportion of the @entity27 within the @entity25 this cosmography represents around 0.32 per cent of the entire universe and scientist claim the visible universe extends 93 billion light years away			1
this does n't include parts of the universe that are not visible			0
according to the video , our local universe is full of clusters of galaxies and filaments that form the edges between large voids			1
' the complexity of what we are seeing is almost overwhelming , ' said @entity10 during her commentary			0
the cosmography film ends with a ' fanciful view of the supergalactic equator , ' pictured			0
this cosmography only represents around 0.32 per cent of the entire universe and scientists claim the visible universe extends at least 93 billion light years away the video below is a three minute edit of the @entity215			1
the full length , 17 - minute version is available from the @entity219 website			0
video : mind - boggling 3d animation shows our galaxy 's position space			0

@entity73 researchers have created @entity227 of what our local universe looks like
it centres around the @entity17 and @entity18 but extends up to 3,000 million light years away
by plotting the universe , astronomers can learn more about how galaxies form
