@entity0 has begun discussions with most of the world 's top automakers in a bid to get self driving cars on the road by 2020			1
' we 'd be remiss not to talk to ... the biggest auto manufacturers			0
they 've got a lot to offer , ' @entity10 , director of @entity0 's self - driving car project , said			1
' for us to jump in and say that we can do this better , that 's arrogant , ' @entity10 said			0
@entity0 has not determined whether it will build its own self - driving vehicles or function more as a provider of systems and software to established vehicle manufacturers			1
@entity0 's self - driving prototype cars , he said , were built in @entity36 by engineering and specialty manufacturing company @entity37			1
@entity15 is open to working with @entity0 on self - driving cars , @entity39 , @entity15 's chief technology officer , said on monday			1
@entity10 's expectation that the first fully autonomous vehicles will be production - ready within five years mirrors the view expressed a day earlier by another @entity45 entrepreneur , @entity44 , chief executive of @entity46			0
@entity44 , who spoke tuesday at the @entity48 conference , said he expects the lack of clear federal regulations covering self - driving cars could delay their introduction until 2022 or 2023			0
@entity10 , however , said his @entity0 colleagues ' do n't see any particular regulatory hurdles			1
' @entity0 has been briefing the @entity55 , the chief @entity56 auto regulator , ' from early on in our program , ' @entity10 said			2
' the worst thing we could do is surprise them			0
' @entity10 said @entity0 is developing and refining self - driving systems and components with such auto parts suppliers as @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			2
@entity0 's prototype cars use microprocessors made by @entity70 , a @entity45 chipmaker that also supplies @entity71 and other automakers			1
@entity0 has already adapted cars to include its self driving technology @entity64 said it began discussions in 2012 about supplying parts for @entity0 's self - driving car			1
@entity0 asked the @entity80 supplier to provide tires , some electronics and other components , according to @entity84 , chief executive of @entity64 's @entity86 region			2
@entity0 shortly will begin deploying a test fleet of fully functioning prototypes of its pod - like self - driving car , which dispenses with such familiar automotive parts as steering wheel , brakes and accelerator pedal			1
while each of the @entity0 prototypes will have a ' test driver ' on board , the cars have no provision for human intervention in steering or braking			1
@entity0 's prototype two - seater ' bubble ' cars have buttons to begin and end the drive , but no other controls			1
an on - board computer uses data from sensors , including radar , a laser and cameras , to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles			0
under the vision unveiled by @entity0 , passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands			2
the cars are also expected to be electric , capable of going 100 miles ( 160 km ) before needing to be recharging			2
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in an attempt to be safer for pedestrians			0
the prototypes are restricted to speeds of 25mph ( 40 km / h ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity0 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			2
but ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity0 's extended maps service , using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			1
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights			2
@entity10 suggested the no - frills look of the @entity0 prototypes , a far cry from the opulent appearance of the self - driving @entity162 concept vehicle unveiled last week by @entity71 , does not necessarily reflect the final design for production			0
he described the @entity0 prototype as ' a practical , near - term testing platform ' that will evolve over time			1
' airliners today do n't look like the @entity171 ' flyer ' of 100 years ago , he said			0
@entity10 said self - driving cars represent a ' transformative ' moment in the evolution of transportation , an opportunity to extend motoring to blind , elderly and disabled persons who otherwise could not drive			0
' you 're really changing the relationship you have with transportation			0
you 're changing what it means to get around			0
' regarding @entity0 's desire to partner with traditional automakers and suppliers , @entity10 said @entity36 is more innovative than is sometimes acknowledged			1
automakers are ' doing something incredibly complicated			0
' ' you look at a car ... and people forget just how much magic there is in that thing			0

manufacturers include @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity198 and @entity19
@entity0 expected to supply its technology to car makers
prototype cars were built in @entity36 by engineering firm @entity37
