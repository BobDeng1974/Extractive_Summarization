by @entity1 reporter @entity2 took a bold step last year : he told teachers and classmates at his @entity7 high school that the student they had known as a girl now wanted to be accepted as a boy			1
his close childhood friend , who also identified as transgender , was ready to reveal his secret , too			2
with the administration 's blessing , a segment featuring the two friends talking about their transitions aired in the school 's classrooms , alongside a basketball team promotion and a feature on the importance of the arts			2
' i did n't get any questions or hate or put - downs or anything like that , ' said @entity2 , now 18 , adding that they called him @entity31 immediately - a drama - free coming - out that would have been extraordinary in schools a decade ago			2
change : transgender high school students @entity2 , ( left ) , and his prom date , @entity37 , pose for photos after picking up their tuxedos for prom in @entity41 , @entity42 with children rejecting the birth gender at younger ages and the transgender rights movement gaining momentum , schools in districts large and small , conservative and liberal , are working to help transitioning youth fit in without a fuss			1
@entity52 this year became the first state with a law spelling out the transgender student rights in public schools , including the ability to use restrooms and to play on sports teams that match their expressed genders			1
another 13 states prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity in schools			1
dozens of districts , from @entity69 and @entity41 to @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 , @entity73 , have adopted similar protections			0
parents are increasingly seeking a comfortable learning environment for their transgender children , according to @entity78 executive director @entity79			1
happy : @entity31 and @entity37 were both born as females and are open about their transgender status in their schools and say friends , teachers and administrators have been much more supportive than they expected his group represented the parents of a transgender @entity89 grade school girl who was prevented from using the girl 's restroom until state civil rights officials ruled in her favor last year			1
there 's ' a new generation of parents who grew up in the age of the gay rights movement and are saying , ` we want to do what is best for our children , ' he said			1
the trend is likely to accelerate with help from the federal government			0
last month , the @entity105 alerted districts in a memo on sexual violence that it would welcome civil rights complaints from transgender students under @entity111 , the 1972 law that bans gender discrimination at schools			1
the guidance gives families new leverage to negotiate access to locker rooms , sports teams and other kinds of accommodations covered under @entity52 's law , said @entity123 , a @entity124 attorney			1
stroll : @entity31 and @entity37 , walk along a creek in the @entity127 in @entity41 , @entity42 he said the memo surprised him because courts have said @entity111 does n't provide protections for sexual orientation or gender identity			1
' it 's going to create a real problem for school districts because the department has the right to go in and attempt to require the district under threat of losing federal funding to meet the standard the department articulates , ' @entity123 said			0
school officials in states without anti-discrimination provisions for transgender residents already have been grappling with how to serve students whose needs conflict with traditional views about when and why boys and girls are separated			1
the @entity152 of @entity153 got involved last year when a high school senior who was born male but identified as a girl wanted to dress accordingly			2
the principal balked , saying the dress code required clothing to conform to gender			2
the school board relented and stood by its decision , even after some parents and students complained , said @entity164 , then the state @entity152 's executive director			0
laces : @entity168 and @entity169 prepare for their prom after announcing they were transgendered - a move which would have been more difficult a generation ago ' for a long time they would have told you we do n't have any trans kids here , ' @entity164 said			0
' but as more and more kids are coming out everywhere else in the country , that is true in @entity153 as well			0
' there is this sense of , ` we have to start figuring out how to deal with this , ' @entity164 said			0
last week , a @entity188 legal group , @entity187 , asked the @entity190 , @entity191 , school board to overrule a high school principal who allowed a transgender freshman to start using the girl 's bathrooms			0
the principal has since limited the student to one girl 's restroom but said treating her like other female students adhered to the recent @entity111 guidance			0
moving on : @entity2 , left , and his prom date , @entity37 , walk towards the @entity41 skyline ' when the issue of gender identity was brought to my attention , i had to educate myself on the issue and what this means in terms of fair and just treatment of transgender people , " @entity205 principal @entity204 said			1
@entity187 attorney @entity216 said schools should instead give transgender students the option of using staff or unisex facilities , as many do			2
' the fact that we are in a position culturally where schools are just caving to these demands is very concerning , ' he said			0
@entity228 , training director of @entity229 , estimates that for every case that makes headlines there are dozens that are resolved quietly and easily			0
since she co-founded the support and advocacy group in 2007 , @entity228 has worked with parents and educators in half of the states			0
' if a school wants to get it , they will , ' @entity228 said .			0
