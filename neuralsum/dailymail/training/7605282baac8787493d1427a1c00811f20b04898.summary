mr @entity4 , a construction worker , was arrested in july 2009 while using an slr camera to take pictures in the centre of @entity38 , @entity39			2
one of the photographs was of the front lobby of a high street bank in a period building			0
he was approached by a police constable and a police community support officer ( @entity46 ) who , mr @entity4 said , asked why he was taking ' discreet photographs ' of a bank			1
' i said : " there 's nothing discreet about this , it 's an slr camera			0
if i was being discreet i 'd use a phone " , ' mr @entity4 told the @entity53			0
mr @entity4 said that the constable then began searching his pockets , so he suggested they go to a police station , partly because he was not carrying any identification but also because he was embarrassed to be searched publicly in his home town			2
as they walked to the station , mr @entity4 claims he was shoved , had his thumb pulled back sharply by the constable , and was eventually pushed to the ground			1
mr @entity4 said : ' he grabbed me in a thumb lock and i pulled away from him , going : " what are you doing ? " i got taken to the ground , face down into a puddle , and the @entity46 , who 's about 18 stone , his knee went into my ribs , which cracked or broke the back of my ribs			2
' legal action : mr @entity4 was handcuffed and claims he was pushed to the ground by the officers who detained him			1
( file photograph ) a doctor 's examination later found other injuries , including abrasions and bruising			0
mr @entity4 was handcuffed and driven to another police station , where he was told he had been arrested for a public order offence and placed in a cell			2
he was released at about 9pm , seven hours after he was stopped			0
he learned two months later that he would face no further action			0
mr @entity4 's solicitor @entity90 said : ' we welcome the chief constable 's decision to admit liability , to apologise and to destroy the records of mr @entity4 's detention			1
' we hope that this complete resolution of the claim will enable the force to learn lessons from this regrettable abuse of police powers			0
' a spokesman for @entity3 said : ' this is a live matter subject to ongoing litigation and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time			0
