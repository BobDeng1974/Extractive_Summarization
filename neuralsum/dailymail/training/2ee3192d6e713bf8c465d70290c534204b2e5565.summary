by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:07 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 00:28 est , 23 july 2013 the date and time of the new royal baby 's birth indicate that he will be highly intuitive and kind by nature , according to a top psychic			2
fourth - generation psychic medium @entity8 , who is based in @entity10 , observed the date and time of the birth of the @entity12 and @entity13 of @entity15 's new son to assess the colours and energy around him			1
she told @entity18 : ' being born on july 22nd astrologically puts the new baby on the cusp of his birth sign ( like his father the month prior , june 21 ) of emotionally sensitive sign of @entity24 and the willful and sensitive sign of @entity26			1
sharing signs : the royal baby is a @entity29 like @entity30 , pictured left , with a moon in @entity33 - the same star - sign as mother @entity35 , pictured right ' his energy is that of someone who will be highly intuitive and kind by nature due to his birth during a full moon cycle			1
' the psychic 's observation that the blue and green energy around the future king indicate prosperity comes as little surprise , however she did note that the colours mean that the infant can expect good health and a way with words			1
' he will probably talk early , ' she said			0
the infant 's sensitive nature will have a strong guiding hand in his mother , she says - but may experience friction with his father over emotional issues			1
' being born on july 22nd puts the new baby on the cusp of emotionally sensitive @entity24 and willful and sensitive @entity26 ' ' this family will be led by the strong , orderly person in @entity67 as a grounded @entity33 , ' she says			1
' the energy they share as a family is very blue and purple which tells me that prince @entity30 will bump heads with his son on issues of emotion but they will always reason it out			2
overall colour : yellow , a very easy , happy vibe			0
' @entity30 and @entity67 welcomed their new son at 4.24pm this afternoon at @entity83 in @entity84			1
the baby 's star sign , @entity24 , is one shared by his father and late grandmother @entity88			2
happy news : the official notice at @entity91 announcing the birth of the royal baby at 4.24pm			2
it means he is a @entity24 , but had he been born half an hour later , he would have been a @entity26 had he been born after 4.54 today , the child would have been a @entity26 , like its great aunt princess margaret , countess of snowdon , and @entity99			1
@entity13 of @entity15 went into labour at 5.30am this morning - with many suggesting the approaching full moon at 11.16am helped bring on the contractions			2

astrologer @entity126 said the future king or queen will be more conventional because it is a @entity29 , but would have been more of a ground - breaker if he was born tomorrow as a @entity26			1
' @entity131 and @entity132 are conjunct in @entity24 and that will give the baby a tremendous amount of go - get energy and that is already in motion , ' he said			1
he added : ' @entity139 and the @entity140 are also in a magnetic connection which will give the baby a star quality and a sparkling charisma			0
' meanwhile there have been numerous theories as to what caused the @entity35 to go into labour - whether it was the full moon , an electrical storm or just conventional ' @entity150 '			1
maternity wards are said to be busier during a full moon , although there is debate in the medical world about whether the moon does encourage women to go into labour			0

' it 's always sort of been an old wives tale saying that the full moon brings women into labour			0
midwives usually do say " i 'm on call			0
it 's a full moon			0
i 'll be busy tonight " , ' she said			0
' there was a study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the @entity183 which is a tidal river and it showed that on the full moon they did have more births			0
' the idea is that because the baby is surrounded by water , the time of the full moon and the high tide causes the waters to break			0
but there 's not enough scientific evidence to show it 's proven			0
' waiting game : members of the world 's media gathered outside @entity200 when @entity35 went into labour at @entity83 in @entity84 this morning birth coach @entity202 , of @entity203 , said : ' as a doula ( birth coach ) who has supported many women in labour , there does seem to be some link between labour kick starting and a full moon			2
