by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 22 june 2012 concerns have been raised that @entity2 could descend into an @entity4 - style civil war after thousands of people took to the streets to protest at the delayed result of the country 's first free presidential election			1
officials were supposed to declare a winner in @entity2 's disputed election today			1
however , the president @entity13 said it needed more time to review complaints by the candidates			1
but critics of the ruling military fear the @entity19 - who most independent observers believe won the election - is being targeted by @entity2 's generals to keep it out of the presidency			1
anger : thousands of people have taken to @entity28 in @entity29 to protest at the delayed result of the country 's first free presidential election which has sparked fears of an army coup fury : critics of the ruling military say the @entity19 - who most independent observers believe won the election - is being targeted by @entity2 's generals to keep it out of the presidency the delay has sent political tensions soaring as the country awaits its first new president in three decades and sparked fears of a military coup			1
some observers have noted the similarity with @entity4 20 years ago when a military - backed government blocked another @entity51 group 's ascent to power through the ballot box			1
it led to the deaths of more than 150,000 @entity4 during the 1990s			0
but @entity56 , speaker of the short - lived democratic parliament dissolved by the ruling military council last week , said : ' what happened in @entity4 can not be repeated in @entity2			1
' the @entity2 people are different and not armed , ' the 61 - year - old microbiologist said			1
' we are fighting a legal struggle via the establishment and a popular struggle in the streets			0
protest : @entity69 supporters chant slogans and one carries a poster with a picture of presidential candidate , @entity73 and @entity74 that reads ' @entity73 , president for @entity2 , revival is the will of the people ' ' this is the ceiling			2
i see the continuation of the struggle in this way			0
' he demanded the army recognize democracy but also offered conciliatory words : ' everyone must submit to popular will			0
' last weekend 's runoff election was long touted as a landmark moment - the choice of @entity2 's first civilian president to take over from the generals who have ruled since @entity95 's removal on february 11 , 2011			1
the @entity96 was a bloody conflict throughout the 1990 's which is estimated to have cost more than 150,000 lives			2
many observers believe its beginnings were similar to the current situation in @entity2 between the @entity19 and the military rulers			1
it began in 1991 when the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) party became popular among the people of @entity4			0
this resulted in the @entity109 cancelling elections after the first round because it feared the @entity106 would win			0
the president @entity112 was forced from office and @entity4 's military took control of the government			2
this led to the @entity106 being banned and thousands of its members were arrested			0
as a result @entity51 guerrillas started an armed campaign against the government			0
the conflict ended with the surrender of the @entity124 and the defeat in 2002 of the @entity126			0
in total more than 70 journalists were assassinated during the conflict			0
instead , it has turned into a confrontation between the @entity51 of the @entity19 and the entrenched elements of @entity95 's old regime - including the military			1
thousands of @entity19 supporters camped out last night in @entity29 's @entity28 - the birthplace of last year 's uprising			1
they were protesting against the delayed election result and also denouncing new amendments to the constitution which gave the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) new powers last week			0
the @entity13 did not say when it would announce the winner of the runoff between the @entity19 's candidate , @entity73 , and @entity95 's former prime minister , @entity146			1
both candidates claim they won , and the commission was supposed to declare the top vote - getter today			1
but its secretary - general , @entity150 , told the state newspaper @entity152 that the winner would be announced on saturday or sunday			1
adding to the confusion and uncertainty were reports about the health of @entity95 , who is serving a life sentence for failing to stop the killing of protesters in the uprising that ousted him last year			0
at one point on tuesday , he was said to be near death , while some believed the report was a pretext by sympathetic allies of @entity95 to transfer him out of prison to a more comfortable facility			0
the commission said the announcement was postponed because a panel of judges must look into about 400 complaints of voting fraud submitted by both campaigns			2
the @entity19 says it is being targeted by an organised campaign to keep it out of the presidency , and that even if @entity73 is declared the victor , he will face deep resistance that will make it impossible for him to govern			1
after two days of voting that ended on sunday , the group declared @entity73 won 52 per cent of the vote			2
@entity146 's camp on monday announced he had won 51.5 per cent of the vote			2
not happy : people were protesting against the delayed election result and also denouncing new amendments to the constitution which gave the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) new powers last week a group of independent jurists known as the judges for @entity2 said @entity73 was the winner along with most newspapers			1
foreign and local election monitors say the runoff was not marked by enough serious or large - scale irregularities to question its validity			0
in a series of swift moves last week , the generals cornered for themselves sweeping powers that effectively subordinate the next president and severely limit his capability for independent action			0
a court order dissolved parliament , which was led by the @entity19 , and the military issued a constitutional declaration that makes the generals the nation 's legislators and gives them control of the budget			1
they will dominate the security system after reshaping a key @entity222 to keep it under their control			0
the generals will also oversee the process of writing @entity2 's new constitution			1
secretary of state @entity227 said the @entity228 expects the military to ' support the democratic transition , to recede by turning over authority			1
' protesters are pictured sleeping during a sit - in at @entity28 last night ' the military has to assume an appropriate role , which is not to try to interfere with , dominate or subvert the constitutional authority , ' she said			0
privately , @entity228 officials have expressed concern that a @entity146 victory could have dangerous fallout , with protests and ensuing instability that could lead the military to take even stronger measures			1
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter			0
while the @entity19 and secular revolutionary groups have denounced the military 's moves , some @entity2 liberals see the steps as a way to prevent an @entity51 takeover by the 82 - year - old @entity19 , or ensure that its hold on power is difficult and temporary			1
' i see the military council at this point as a protector of the identity of the state against the @entity19 , who are not a purely @entity2 party , but an international one , ' said @entity266 , a member of the @entity265			1
he cited celebrations in @entity268 ruled by the @entity269 , an offshoot of the @entity19 , when news broke of @entity73 's victory claims			1
anti-islamist figures and others seen as backers of the military were escalating rhetoric against the @entity19 on tv talk shows , accusing the group of seeking to set up a ' parallel state ' or of forming armed militias			1
others defended the military , saying the generals had to protect @entity2 from destabilizing changes			1
further raising the tone and sense of confusion , rumors circulated on social media sites and even some state - run media of tanks moving on the outskirts of @entity29 , although the reports could not be confirmed			0
' it is clear that there is sharp polarization between the army and the @entity19 , ' said @entity298 , a prominent rights lawyer and activist			2
' it suggests that the next few days will probably be difficult for @entity2 and the @entity2			2
' uncertainty : adding to the confusion were reports about the health of former @entity2 leader @entity95			2
at one point on tuesday he was said to be near death the @entity19 has warned that a win by @entity146 , widely seen as an extension of the @entity95 regime , could only be the result of fraud and that it would send its supporters out onto the streets			2
still , the deputy head of the @entity19 , @entity314 , sought to defuse fears that the group would resort to violence if @entity146 is declared the winner , saying the @entity19 will use peaceful means , ' not through violence or terrorism			1
' @entity146 's campaign sought to appeal to the international community , holding a news conference in @entity325 for foreign correspondents to send a message that it will accept ' whatever the outcome			0
' @entity329 , an adviser to @entity146 , said the campaign was confident he was the winner			0
but he added , ' at the end of the day , candidate @entity146 is willing to accept the results regardless of the outcomes			0
' ' in the event that candidate @entity73 is indeed successful and victorious in the elections , the first phone he will receive will be from candidate @entity146 , ' @entity329 said			0
adding to the electoral limbo has been the murkiness over the state of @entity95 's health			2
the 84 - year - old former leader has been said to be in poor health since his ouster , even appearing at his trial in a hospital bed			0
on tuesday , state media reported he had suffered a stroke and was put on life support			2
security officials said wednesday that he was in a coma but off life support and that his heart and other vital organs were functioning			2
security officials said he had been moved from his prison where he has been kept since his june 2 conviction to a military hospital overlooking the @entity359 in @entity29 - a transfer that could stir up anger among opponents of the regime			2
@entity95 's wife , @entity364 , was at his bedside in the hospital			0
the security officials said a team of 15 doctors , including heart , blood and brain specialists , was supervising his care			0
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media			0
the conflicting reports raised suspicions among some of @entity95 's opponents that the rumors were intended to justify the move to hospital - something his lawyers have sought			0
' there are attempts to spoil the political scene , ' the @entity19 's @entity314 said , citing ' a fierce campaign of black rumors all across the country			1

officials were supposed to declare a winner in @entity2 's disputed election today but election commission said it needs more time to review complaints
most independent observers believe the @entity19 won the election
but critics fear the ruling military is attempting to keep the group out of the presidency
@entity228 secretary of state @entity227 said @entity228 expects the military to ' support the democratic transition '
