by @entity0 ever wondered what your new lover is thinking the first time they see you stripped bare ? my bet is any - and probably all - of the following : what he 's thinking : @entity10 i 'm about to have sex ! @entity0 reveals what goes through your partner 's head when you first strip off in front of one another if a naked woman is standing in front of you it means sex is on the cards , so his first reaction is to feel mighty pleased			1
this is quickly taken over by a not so pleasant thought … is my penis big enough ? unlike women , all his bits are out there and on display immediately			1
which is why he 's frantically searching your face in an attempt to read any minute micro-expression that hints he 's not living up to expectations			2
if he thinks he 's passed this test , his next thought is another panicky one ... say i ca n't perform ? women can fake desire , men ca n't			1
the first time you have sex is unbearably exciting but the pressure is on … him			2
he 's looking at your breasts : after all that 's been filtered and processed he can finally pay attention to what 's in front of him			2
time for the ' bra on vs bra off ' test			2
you looked great in that cleavage - boosting @entity63 push - up but do they stand up to scrutiny without the scaffolding ? he 's seeing what you 've done down there : this is a precarious moment because whether you 've waxed , trimmed , kept a ' landing pad ' or whipped the whole lot off , you ca n't please all the people all of the time			0
some men love no hair because all is revealed , others look and instantly think of a plucked turkey			1
@entity0 says that it is important for both of you to have body confidence in order to have great sex he 's watching to see how body confident you are : if one arm flies up to hide your breasts and the other heads south to cover down below , he knows he 's in for some pretty standard sex			1
stand tall and let yourself be admired and he knows it 's going to be fabulous			0
what he 's not noticing : your weight			0
unlike breasts , body size ca n't really be camouflaged			1
by the time you 're both naked , he 's already got a pretty good idea of what he 'll see			1
besides , he 's far more interested in looking at the naughty bits to notice whether your thighs wobble when you walk			0
what she 's thinking : she 's checking out your body generally : women are just as lookist as men are - studies tracking eye movement show women give men the once over physically just as much as men do women			1
it does n't mean we 'll dump you if you 're not sporting a six - pack but do n't kid yourself we 're immune to what shape you 're in			0
she 's comparing to see who wins the body beautiful competition : @entity0 says that while everyone appreciates a good body , we are primarily attracted to faces if you 're in much better shape than we are , our body image issues are kicking in big time			1
ohmigod i should never had had those crisps earlier			0
his legs are more shapely than mine are ! look at that bottom ! how come men 's bums do n't droop like women 's do ? she 's checking out how big you are : but it 's the opposite to what you think : if you 're over size , this works against you ! it 's not true that women love men with big penises : it often makes sex uncomfortable , even painful			1
so if you 're average size , feel reassured			0
even if you 're undersized , do n't panic			0
so long as you 're good with your tongue , it wo n't matter			0
she 's looking to see if you have an erection : if you have n't , the first thing we 'll think is that it 's our fault			0
instantly reassure her it does n't mean you do n't fancy her now you 've seen her starkers or you 'll both end up deflated			0
she 's watching your reaction to her nakedness : this , quite frankly , is concerning us more than anything else			0
the correct response is your eyes lustfully travelling over our body and a ' you 're good enough to eat ' expression on your face			2
what is she not noticing ? not much ! women are better at taking in detail than men			1
we 're more likely to notice that mole on your back , tan line , what brand underwear you just peeled off , your feet , your knees , how hairy you are ... but do n't panic because both sexes are far more forgiving than you think			0
while everyone appreciates a good looking body , people are more attracted to faces and ultimately fall for the person inside			2
