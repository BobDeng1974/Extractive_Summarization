the atmosphere was as expected and so was this @entity2 team			2
the @entity3 was a game too far for @entity6 ’s men			0
credit to @entity2 ’s supporters because the intensity , the wall of noise predicted by @entity11 was mighty impressive before @entity13 took control			1
@entity2 are a mediocre team			0
@entity16 is a magnificent sporting cathedral and the mood was passionate and partisan , which is just the way we like it			1
every fan inside this grand old stadium was on their feet , belting it out as they waited for the teams to emerge from the tunnel			0
when they did , this fabulous place stirred again when the bagpipe players began to hum @entity44			2
their tails were up and rightly so after @entity47 ’s magnificent goal against the @entity48 last friday had sent 50,000 kilts home happy			2
you just knew what a goal against @entity13 would do to this place , but no amount of singing can turn @entity2 into a decent football team			1
@entity56 opened the scoring before the break to put @entity13 in the driving seat @entity61 's second - half header gave @entity13 a cushion their dominance deserved how @entity64 , the dreary concrete bowl constructed in west @entity66 seven years ago , could do with a good dose of this before @entity13 play their next match there in march			1
they are regenerating the surrounding areas , so why not sort out the stadium acoustics a go , too ? something must be done because the supporters of both these teams reminded us what a football stadium should sound like on a big match night			2
at times , the place crackled with excitement			0
there was a boo for everything : @entity13 flag transported across the pitch			1
@entity89 ’s name read out			0
and so it went on			0
it was old school , blood and thunder and a reminder of the days when these two slugged it out for pride and honour at the end of every season on a churned up pitch at @entity64 or @entity103			1
@entity105 fans hoist the @entity106 , complete with ' yes ' , aloft and bellow out a ditty 5,000 @entity13 fans made the trip across the border and the @entity13 gave them plenty of reasons to cheer quite what this means for @entity13 - other than a sixth successive victory following the @entity117 disaster - is a different matter			1
there were moments of forced patriotism , such as the sight of @entity13 ’s assistant manager @entity123 stalking the technical area and appealing for calm			1
it was rough , rather than refined			0
perhaps @entity123 remembers @entity127 and @entity128 ripping each other ’s heads off when @entity2 beat @entity13 1 - 0 at @entity103 way back in 1985			1
there was the odd skirmish here , but the modern player has a different constitution			0
there is a bit of back chat and then they agree to swap shirts at the end of the game			0
at times there some pedantic squabbles , but no - one left the pitch with stud marks raked down their thigh or a bloodied nose after this largely one - sided clash			1
no - one ’s socks were cut to ribbons , either			0
there was a bit of afters when @entity156 got sick and tired of @entity2 right - back @entity157 nibbling away at his ankles in a feisty opening spell			0
@entity157 gets to grips with @entity156 with tempers flaring between the warring duo @entity156 gets his own back and a referee 's assistant had to stand between the pair ( above ) @entity61 , sensational throughout , showed his colours when he bawled out his team - mate @entity168 for a careless pass long before @entity13 took control			1
to say @entity13 controlled the tempo or ever looked entirely comfortable would be stretching the imagination , but they certainly played in bursts			1
@entity2 boasted just two players - goalscorer @entity174 ( @entity175 ) and @entity176 ( @entity177 ) - from the @entity178			0
the rest are @entity181 players and they looked like it , too			0
this is a unique fixture , a game that has fallen off the international radar in recent times because of the sheer number of qualifying games and reciprocal arrangements with opposition teams over friendly fixtures			0
it means @entity2 , who were courageous and honest , will probably have to wait a while again @entity13 can find a date for them in their congested fixture list			1
@entity11 makes his point to two - goal hero @entity61 as @entity13 made it six wins on the spin @entity201 praises attack as @entity61 approaches record @entity2 's @entity204 ( centre ) is closed down by @entity168 ( left ) and @entity206 @entity6 ’s side were beaten 3 - 2 at @entity64 last august but this defeat , courtesy of goals from @entity56 and two from @entity61 - felt terminal			1
there is a huge gulf and that is saying something because this @entity13 team is not operating at anything like the level of world champions @entity221			2
by the time @entity224 referee @entity223 blew the final whistle , the stands at @entity16 had emptied			2
this was @entity13 ’s night			2
they rushed over to the travelling @entity13 fans at the final whistle , saluting them after emerging with their reputations enhanced after this victory			1
all they can do is to beat the opposition put in front of them and they are certainly doing that after travelling north of the border to beat @entity6 ’s side			0
the only disappointment is that they could n’t take this unrivalled atmosphere back with them .			0

@entity13 did not freeze in the intense *cauldron* of @entity16
*routinely* booed by the home fans , goals from @entity56 and @entity61 's *double* did not stop the @entity105 singing
the atmosphere added to the sense of *occasion* , forcing players into a series of pedantic squabbles all over this zippy surface
how dreary @entity64 could do with a good dose of this when @entity13 play their next match there in march
