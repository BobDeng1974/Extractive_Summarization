due to a diet that consists primarily of grass the @entity28 need large foraging grounds , with the heights of the @entity9 , which are more than 4,200 meters high , providing the perfect location			0

dedication : photographer @entity15 spent several days following the baboons in order to the gain their trust @entity71 : a @entity23 baboon stands up straight to catch the first rays of sunshine as they break over the horizon @entity23 baboons are not actually baboons in a traditional sense , but a distinct species of old world monkey which are easily recognisable by the patches of hairless skin on their chests due to a diet that consists primarily of grass the @entity28 need large foraging grounds , with the heights of the @entity9 , which are more than 4,200 meters high , providing the perfect location photographer @entity15 followed the group as they got up early one morning and climbed to the nearest peak to catch the the morning rays comfort in numbers : a group of the highly sociable primates huddle together for warmth in the nest in @entity10 's stunning @entity9 mountain range @entity15 , who is a professor of photography and mathematics , said : ' i really enjoyed being close to @entity11 and observing their behavior : the grooming , the babies playing and the occasional fights between males			1
' they like to spend the night on the cliffs to seek refuge from predators , so i used to wait for them to come out of their night nest before sunrise and then go back before sunset to wait for them to return			0
that is where i got the best pictures , showing the monkeys with the amazing backdrop of the @entity9 mountains			2
' i was fascinated by the location that these primates live it			0
i think this is what makes them special , so i was especially interested in portraying their habitat together with their special features , such as the long fur and the ' bleeding heart ' that they display on their chest			0
' they are very special in that the live very high up on the mountains - more than 4200 meters above sea level			0
furthermore , they feed exclusively on grass - no fruit , no insects like many other primates - so need a large foraging ground			0
' they live in large groups with more than one leader			0
i find them extremely beautiful and fascinating with their fur and heart - shaped mark on the chest			2
' they are generally not aggressive and oblivious to photographers and occasional visitors			0
i spent three weeks following the same group of monkeys from sunrise to sunset , so they grew accustomed to my presence and let me get very close to them			1
