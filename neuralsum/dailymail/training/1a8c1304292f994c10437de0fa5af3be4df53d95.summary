there seems to be a wave of chargers that promise to speed up the time it takes to fully charge a phone or tablet			2
but many of the technologies are either concepts or in the very early stages of development			0
the @entity13 is different - not only does it claim to halve the amount of time it takes to get a battery from zero to 100 per cent , it is available to pre-order for both @entity19 and @entity21 handsets now			2
but , when switched on , syncing is disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging			1
its makers claim this halves the amount of time it takes to get a battery from zero to 100 % technically , it ’s still a prototype , but working models are available from @entity38 and will ship in less than two months			1
designed by a team from @entity40 , @entity41 , the @entity13 has two functions			1
when it ’s plugged into a device , but switched off , it acts like a standard usb cable and syncs content from one device to another			1
@entity49 comes with a @entity51 connector ( centre ) , for the @entity19 and later models , the fourth generation @entity55 and above , and the ipad mini range			0
it also has a @entity58 ( left ) option that will work for @entity60 , @entity61 and other compatible devices , including @entity63			0
the other end of the cable is powered by a usb port ( right ) other features of the @entity13 ( pictured ) include a dual - sided usb port , durable aluminium connectors and nylon protective material			2
it is available in black and white from @entity38 but , when it is switched on , the syncing functions are disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging the connected device			1
an @entity79 company has developed technology that can charge a mobile phone in a few seconds and an electric car in minutes			0
using nano - technology , @entity84 - based @entity83 said its battery can store a higher charge more quickly , in effect acting like a super-dense sponge to soak up power			0
while the prototype is currently far too bulky for a mobile phone , the company believes it will be ready by 2016			0
the @entity38 campaign features a graphic that shows the @entity49 charging a device twice as fast as a traditional charger			1

the @entity49 is expected to ship in march			2
its @entity38 campaign has already raised $ 178,832 ( £ 118,195 ) of its $ 10,000 ( £ 6,610 ) target			1
the $ 20 ( £ 13 ) and $ 23 ( £ 15 ) early bird prices have sold out , but backers can still buy a single cable for $ 27 ( £ 18 ) , or $ 49 ( £ 32 ) for two			1
after the initial run of cables are shipped , they will retail for $ 36 ( £ 24 )			0
