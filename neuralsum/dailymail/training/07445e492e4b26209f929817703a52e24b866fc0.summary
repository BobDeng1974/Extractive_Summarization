by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 24 october 2012 a federal appeals court has blocked the scheduled execution of a mass killer convicted of eight slayings that shocked @entity5 in the 1970s			1
the decision by the 11th @entity7 came during a flurry of legal decisions over claims that 64 - year - old @entity11 suffers from mental illness so severe he can not be executed			1
@entity11 , a paranoid schizophrenic with delusions that he 's the ' prince of @entity14 , ' had faced a planned lethal injection at 6 pm yesterday in @entity5 's death chamber			1
life behind bars : @entity11 , 64 , has been on @entity19 for 34 years for killing eight people in the 1970s			1
he was due to be put to death on tuesday before receiving a late stay of execution the @entity25 @entity24 quickly upheld the stay of execution			1
@entity11 has spent more than three decades on death row for eight brutal killings , including those of a teenage couple , in 1977 and 1978			1
the @entity24 had initially rejected an emergency appeal by @entity11 earlier on tuesday - as did the @entity33 - before making its later ruling			1
the state of @entity5 failed in its bid to overturn the decision			2
the appeals court set a schedule for motions that will likely delay the execution until at least the first week of november , if not longer			1
victim : he raped and shot @entity44 , 17 , as she went for ice cream with her boyfriend in january 1978			0
her boyfriend was also shot dead @entity5 attorney general @entity48 's office argued in court papers that the late ruling ' makes a mockery of the state 's compelling interest in finality ' in @entity11 's case			1
he has been on death row for 34 years			2
in @entity60 , the nation 's high court noted that chief justice @entity61 took no part in the case			0
there was no further explanation			0
@entity11 was convicted of shooting eight bound and blindfolded people execution - style in @entity5 in 1977 , then killing a teenage couple months later in 1978 after they left a church event planning to get some ice cream			1
he has previously been ruled mentally competent to be executed , and over recent days federal judges in @entity5 , @entity71 and @entity60 have wrestled with his appeals over that issue			0
the execution was scheduled after the @entity5 @entity24 this month upheld a lower court ruling based on testimony by a panel of psychiatrists appointed by governor @entity79			1
the state justices wrote that ' @entity11 understands what is taking place and why			1
' the latest ruling from the federal appeals court said it would explore whether the @entity5 @entity24 's decision was an ' unreasonable determination of the facts ' based on @entity11 's documented history of mental illness			1
his lawyers have argued that @entity11 lacks rational understanding , because he suffers from delusions that he is the ' prince of @entity14 ' and that @entity14 is preparing him to return to @entity93 after his execution to save the @entity25 from a communist plot			1
@entity11 was convicted of two sets of murders and is suspected in a third			1
in 1977 , he and two accomplices fatally shot six people at a @entity102 home , then the worst mass slaying in @entity105 history			0
even more shocking was @entity11 's murder of a teenage couple who had left a church event in @entity109 in 1978 and never met up with friends they planned to meet for ice cream			1
legal wrangling : @entity11 has been granted a stay of execution following a late court ruling @entity11 was sentenced to death for eight killings in 1977 and 1978 , although some investigators believe he killed even more			1
may 1977 : an elderly couple were found beaten , tied up and shot dead in their motel room			0
the gun was used in @entity11 's later crimes but he was not charged as there was no other corroborating evidence			2
july 1977 : with three others , @entity11 broke into a house and tied up eight people and shot them in the head			1
@entity131 , 33 , @entity132 , 24 , @entity133 , 35 , @entity134 , 26 , @entity135 , 37 , and @entity136 , 35 , all died			0
two survived : @entity137 , 45 , and @entity138 , 24			0
he was convicted of the killings			0
october 1977 : posing as a police officer , he shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery			0
january 1978 : shot and killed @entity144 , 17 , on his way to get ice cream with his girlfriend , @entity44			0
@entity44 , 17 , was raped and also shot			0
he was convicted of the killings			0
in the 1977 case , @entity11 pretended to be an electric utility worker to gain access to the @entity102 house , which police said was a local hangout for marijuana dealers whom the bandits wanted to rob of drugs and cash			2
former @entity105 prosecutor @entity161 said most of the victims were friends who happened to drop by the house while @entity11 and the other men were there			2
the victims were blindfolded and bound , but the encounter turned violent after a mask worn by one of @entity11 's gang fell off and his face was spotted by a victim			2
the decision was made to kill all eight people in the house , said @entity161 , now a legal adviser to a local police department			2
they were shot one by one			0
almost six months later , passers - by spotted the bodies of @entity144 and @entity44 , both 17 , who had been fatally shot			0
@entity44 also had been raped			0
her jewelry was missing along with cash from @entity180 's wallet			0
trial testimony showed the couple had stopped at a romantic ' lovers ' lane ' when they were approached by @entity11 , dressed as a police officer			2
@entity11 shot @entity144 in the car and @entity44 tried to flee but was caught			2
the randomness of the crime and the youth of the two victims stunned many in @entity105 , then a slower - paced place that was yet to become the infamous ' cocaine cowboys ' murder capital of the 1980s			0
@entity11 confessed to killing ' the two kids ' after he was arrested in april 1978 for the earlier murders , court records show			1
@entity44 's mother , @entity200 , waited for decades for @entity11 's execution and often said that ' if she could , she would pull the switch , ' her son @entity198 , told the @entity203			1
@entity200 died in may , according to her son			0
he said : ' she planned on attending the execution			0
she wanted to be there for her daughter			0
' @entity11 was sentenced to die in both cases ; he unsuccessfully used the insanity defence in the trial over the teenagers ' murders			2
fate : @entity11 was due to be put death in @entity215 by lethal injection at 6pm yesterday @entity161 said the gun he used was also traced to the killings of an elderly couple slain outside a @entity105 motel , but he was never charged with that crime because there was no other corroborating evidence			1
the two accomplices in the 1977 slayings , @entity226 and @entity227 , were found guilty in separate murder trials and were executed in the 1980s			2
a third man , who stayed in the car the entire time , pleaded guilty to lesser charges and testified against @entity11 and the other two			2
it has been 34 years since @entity11 was first sentenced to die			1
that is longer than many on death row but by no means the record in @entity5			0
@entity239 records show several inmates have been on death row since the early 1970s and one first got there in 1967 .			0
