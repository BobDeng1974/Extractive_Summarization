but she was not ordered to carry out community service after @entity29 heard she suffers regular headaches and nosebleeds			1
she received a nine - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , in addition to a three - month curfew			1
criticising a pre-sentence report suggesting @entity19 should be exempt from community service , judge @entity36 said : ' this trial included normal working hours , this defendant gave evidence to the jury and was cross examined			1
' she did n't require any form of facility to deal with these headaches and nosebleeds and there were no outward manifestations of discomfort whatsoever			1
' during her trial @entity19 claimed the @entity11 footage of her slipping the notes into her pocket was actually her ' double checking ' to make sure no notes had accidentally fallen out of the cash tray into the bottom of the drawer			2
she claimed : ' it was money i had had in my pocket because i was going to take it to the bank - i had accumulated it over time at home			2
' it was money that had been lying around			0
i thought ' let me just put it in my account '			0
' @entity74 @entity73 heard how the cashier told mr @entity18 : ' i know this looks bad , but it 's my own money , i was going to put it in the bank and i forgot it was in my pocket			2
' judge @entity79 said : ' this was a significant breach of trust			0
' on the 6 february of this year following a fully and strenuously contested trial you were convicted of one count of theft from @entity1 - something which was a serious and flagrant breach of trust			1
' you had been employed as a cashier at a @entity16 branch of @entity1 for some 12 years , up to the 24 april 2013			1
' you were summarily dismissed following the observations of the store manager which led to your trial and conviction			0
' your duties included doing the change run before the store opened			0

' you were observed by @entity18 , the store manager , who had access to viewing the @entity11 , and he saw you helping yourself to monies , misappropriating them and putting them into your pocket			2
' this was to the extent that you were caught red handed with your hands literally in the till			0
' this involved a flagrant breach of trust and i have no doubt that you thought about what you were going to go , and you planned what you were going to do			0
' it was consistent in as much as it involved four tills and not merely one till			2
' judge @entity79 added that a pre-sentence report indicated @entity19 displayed ' not one shred ' of remorse			0
at an earlier hearing , the cashier 's barrister @entity130 said : ' this defendant is now 33 - years - old , as a result of her arrest she was immediately dismissed from @entity1 - that 's not a mitigating factor but she 's since been on employment support allowance of £ 72.40 per week			1

' ' she has asked me to express her genuine remorse to the court having reflected on the matter , ' he continued			2
' as a consequence of her behaviour she has lost her employment , but more moreover the nature of this particular offence will mean it will have a significant impact on her future job prospects			0
' it is also right to say that hitherto she was a person of good character			0
